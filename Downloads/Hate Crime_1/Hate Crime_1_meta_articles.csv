New York Man Arrested for Hate Crime
John H. Durham, United States Attorney for the District of Connecticut, and David Sundberg, Special Agent in Charge of the New Haven Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, today announced that CHRISTOPHER RASCOLL, 48, of Blauvelt, New York, has been charged by federal criminal complaint with making anti-Semitic death threats to a resident of Stratford, Connecticut.
Rascoll was arrested on June 26 in New York City. He appeared yesterday before U.S. Magistrate Judge William I. Garfinkel in Bridgeport and was ordered detained.
As alleged in the criminal complaint, on December 23, 2019, the first day of Hanukkah, Rascoll began sending the victim, who is Jewish, threatening text messages. In several messages, which continued into May 2020, Rascoll threatened to murder or seriously injure the victim. He also threatened to blow up the victim's house and car. Some of Rascoll's threatening text messages contained anti-Semitic references to the Holocaust. On December 23, 2019, Rascoll sent a message that included the words ""Suns about to go down. It would be a shame if your house were used to light the menorah. Or turned in a gas chamber."" On April 8, 2020, Rascoll wrote ""I'm going to kill you. You better be gone because if you're in [the victim's housing community] Easter weekend I'm going to stick you in an oven. Or I'm going to shoot you.""
The complaint charges Rascoll with one count of interference with the right to fair housing, a hate crime, which carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years; and two counts of threatening communications, an offense that carries a maximum term of five years of imprisonment on each count.
U.S. Attorney Durham stressed that a complaint is only a charge and is not evidence of guilt. Charges are only allegations and a defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
This matter is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation with assistance from the Stratford Police Department. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Sarala V. Nagala and Amanda S. Oakes.

When Kwon confronted the man on his racism, the man approached him, trying to kick him, and yelling racial slurs. Eventually, as Kwon filmed the entire interaction, the man lurched at him, shoving him to the ground. Thankfully, Mr. Kwon sustained no injuries.

Nearly 15,900 law enforcement agencies reported a total of 7,314 incidents of bias- or prejudice-motivated crime in 2019 -- up from 7,120 in 2018 -- and 8,559 related offenses. As in past years, race was the primary motivation, followed by religion and sexual orientation. 
[READ:California Firearm Purchases, Concerns of Violence Are Up During Pandemic]
The number of hate crimes -- criminal offenses motivated by bias against the victim's race/ethnicity/ancestry, gender, gender identity, religion, disability or sexual orientation, according to the FBI -- varied by state, with California reporting the highest number: 1,221 bias-motivated crimes. More than 800 of those were categorized as crimes against people. The rest were against property, with 330 crimes categorized as vandalism. 
Following the Golden State with the most hate crimes were New York (618), New Jersey (478), Washington (664) and Texas (560). Texas was home to more than half of the hate-crime murders reported in 2019; 22 people were killed in El Paso during a race-motivated shooting in August -- the most lethal hate crime attack recorded by the FBI, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University--San Bernardino. 
Alabama reported zero hate crimes in 2019. Wyoming (6), Arkansas (10), Iowa (13), Mississippi (15) and Maryland (18) reported the next fewest. 
One factor impacting the state-by-state reporting is the number of agencies participating in this data collection. Law enforcement agencies vary in number, based on state population, and they aren't required to report hate crime statistics to the FBI. In Hawaii, for example, just one agency reported hate crime incidents to the FBI. That state agency covers approximately 975,000 people, according to the FBI; the state's population is 1.43 million. Meanwhile, California had 737 participating agencies covering its 39.5 million residents. 
Other findings from the FBI report: 
-- Of the 1,715 victims of anti-religious hate crimes, anti-Jewish bias led to the crimes that impacted 60.2% of the victims.
-- For single-bias hate crimes, 57.6% of victims were targeted because of their race/ethnicity/ancestry, 20.1% were targeted because of their religion and 16.7% were targeted because of their sexual orientation.
-- There were 4,930 victims of race/ethnicity/ancestry motivated hate crime among single-bias hate crime incidents in 2019, and 48.5% were victims of crimes driven by offenders' anti-Black or anti-African American bias.

MCPHAIL University ofTexas at Austin Currently, hate crimes and hate crime policy are receiving increased public and scholarly attention. Much of the attention has been focused on crimes committed out of bias toward a victim's membership in a group based on race, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity/national origin. However, more recently, gender has been included as a status category, often causing heated debate. This article looks at the history of the initial exclusion, then inclusion, of gender in the hate crime domain. The reasons for the uneasy fit of gender as a status category are recounted, as well as arguments both for and against inclusion of gender within the hate crime model. The problem of gender essentialism is examined, which results in the marginalization of the multiple category statuses of many women. The article con- cludes with implications for research, policy, and practice. Key words: violence against women, hate crimes, bias crimes, gender-bias hate crimes, sexual assault, domes- tic violence AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN is dragged to his death behind a pickup truck in Jasper, Texas. A young gay college student is beaten and left to die draped on a fence in Laramie, Wyoming. Four schoolgirls and their female teacher are shot to death by two male classmates at Westside Middle School in Jonesboro, Arkan- sas. Each of these horrific murders left the coun- try first reeling and then debating the causes and solutions to such violence. However, the three crimes were discussed in very different ways. The first two crimes are widely regarded as hate crimes and led to a national discussion on racismand homophobia, respectively. However, Jenness and Grattet (2001) noted the latter crime was treated very differently from the others. In contrast to these two incidents, the murder of four young girls in a Jonesboro, Arkansas schoolyard in March of 1998 generally has not been viewed as a hate crime, despite the revelation that the young boys in custody for the killings sought to shoot girls because it was girls that angered them. That is, they selected their victims on the basis of gender. Time Magazine (Labi, 1998) referred to it as a ""youth crime"" and Newsweek (McCormick, 1998) called it a ""schoolyard crime."" Because of this framing, the in- cident triggered a different set of legal and policy discussions, most often in terms of school violence and the debate over gun control.

The story of the inter- section between gender and hate crime policy has been tumultuous and controversial. The debate continues today. This article will exam- ine the intersection of gender and hate crime policy. Before discussing the specifics of gender, hate crime policy in gen- eral will be reviewed followed by a history of gender in hate crime policy. The current debate over whether gender fits within the hate crime paradigmwill be recounted with both sides of the controversy presented. The problemof gen- der essentialismwithin hate crime policy will be presented, which means examining the multi- ple status categories of women; for instance, how do we talk about hate crimes against women of color and lesbian women? The article will conclude with implications for policy, prac- tice, and research. HATE CRIME OVERVIEW It is beyond the scope of this article to provide a complete review of hate crime policy, which is incredibly complex and nuanced. However, it is helpful to have a basic understanding of the hate crime policy arena before looking at how gender fits within this domain. Although the term hate crime is new, the violence it describes is not. In cataloguing intergroup violence and conflict in the 20th century in his book Mass Hate , Kressel (1996) wrote, ""Blood has gushed so freely, and with such frequency, that one might consider the urge to kill one's neighbor an inborn characteristic of our species"" (p. 1). Al- though violence based on prejudice and bias is not new, the social movements that brought themto the forefront are more recently orga- nized. Hate crime policy emerged from a multi- tude of social movements including the civil rights movement, the women's rights move- ment, the gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgendered (GLBT) movement, and most recently, the crime victims' movement. Actually, the term hate crime is somewhat of a misnomer. It is difficult to operationalize hate, a 126 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE / April 2002 KEY POINTS OF THE RESEARCH REVIEW The category of gender was actively excluded fromhate crime policy during the early years of the policy process when social movements and advocacy organizations set the policy agenda. Gender as a status category was later added as the policy-making process matured and a policy tem- plate for hate crimes was institutionalized. Be- cause gender was already a standard subject of federal discrimination law, the status was folded in by policy makers rather than being actively pro- moted by women's groups. Hate crime policy in general remains controver- sial, although the status categories of religion, race, and ethnicity are largely established. The cat- egories of sexual orientation, gender, and disabil- ity have been more recently proposed and frequently debated. In some ways, gender as a status category fits the hate crime paradigm in that women are often dis- criminately selected as victims due solely to their gender, the assault is often unprovoked, no other motives (such as robbery) are involved, gender- based epithets are frequently used, there are long- termemotional and physical consequences, and women as a group are affected. In some ways, gender as a status category is deter- mined to not to fit the hate crime paradigm, most often due to the fact that women often know their attackers and that violence against women is so prevalent. Gender as a status category is often viewed in an essentialist way, ignoring the multiple statuses of the victimsuch as women of color and lesbian women. The effects of adding gender to hate crime policy are debatable. For some, such an addition is merely symbolic with little enforcement or over- sight. Alternatively, others believe if monitored and enforced, gender as a status category could provide new protections and increased options for women. Gender is increasingly part of the hate crime pol- icy template, which calls for a plan of action with regard to practice, policy, and research. The story of the intersection between gender and hate crime policy has been tumultuous and controversial. subjective human emotion, much as it is diffi- cult to characterize love. Instead, Lawrence (1999) described hate crimes as ""bias crimes""; that is, crimes committed as an act of prejudice: ""I use the term'bias crime' rather than 'hate crime' to emphasize that the key factor in a bias crime is not the perpetrator's hatred of the vic- timper se, but rather his bias or prejudice to- ward that victim"" (p. 9). Weisburd and Levin (1994) defined hate crimes as ""the offender's discriminatory use of violence to enforce a par- ticular social hierarchy that is biased against the targeted status hierarchy"" (p. 36). Hate crimes can be the result of hatred but also stemfroma perpetrator's stereotypical views of their victim and the community they represent, resentment, a desire to punish that victim and their commu- nity for alleged transgressions, feelings of power and control, a need to keep victims and their communities in their place, a need for a thrill or adventure, the need to affirmmasculin- ity and male bonds, and from multiple motives, and from motives the perpetrator may not even be aware of himself (Franklin, 1998; Levin & McDevitt, 1993). Bias crimes generally consist of two parts; that is, the basic crime (for instance, an assault or vandalism) and the motivation that inspired it. Lawrence (1999) described two models of bias crime--the ""discriminatory selection model"" and the ""animus model."" The former is based on a perpetrator's discriminatory selection of a vic- tim. In this model, ""it is irrelevant why an of- fender selected his victimon the basis of race or group; it is sufficient that the offender did so"" (p. 30). The animus model rests on the of- fender's hatred of the victim's actual or per- ceived group membership. Particular statutes criminalize one or the other or a combination of these two motivations. Which status groups are selected for coverage by hate crimes is a continuing debate and a fo- cus of this article. Jenness and Broad (1997) de- scribed such statutes: The protected statuses contained in hate crime legis- lation, in effect, articulate who does and does not qualify as a victim. In so doing, they also determine who is and is not entitled to legal recourse . . . there is a definite ranking of status provisions in hate crime law. (p. 42) Race, ethnicity, and religion are the most widely accepted, with disability being added later, and sexual orientation and gender categories being the most controversial and therefore included in some statutes and not in others. The anti-hate-crime movement has sought le- gal remedies for the problem of hate crime. Civil remedies and enhanced penalties were often adopted based on the supposition that hate crimes are not merely acts of violence against an individual but cause great harmto the victim's community specifically, as well as to the social fabric of our society more generally. Largely in response to social movement activism and pub- lic attention to several widely publicized hate crimes, by 1995, the federal government, 37 states, and the District of Columbia had passed hate crime laws (Jacobs & Potter, 1998). The passage of such laws has not been with- out controversy. Opponents of hate crime law cite a variety of objections including Constitu- tional challenges to the First and Fourteenth Amendments (free speech and equal protection, respectively); fears that such policies promote divisiveness and identity politics at the expense of unity; and problems with establishing moti- vation (Jacobs & Potter, 1998). However, propo- nents of hate crime policy believe, ""Because ra- cial harmony and equality are among the highest values held in our society, crimes that violate these values should be punished and must be punished, specifically as bias crimes"" (Lawrence, 1999, p. 167). Often proponents seek to ""send a message"" with hate crime laws that prejudice expressed in violent assaults or prop- erty damage will not be tolerated. POLICY HISTORY OF GENDER AND HATE CRIME As previously mentioned, social movement organizations have provided the primary impe- tus to much hate crime policy. These organiza- tions were outraged by the violence perpetrated against their members. Keeping informal statis- tics was often a way to begin to address the problem. However, as advocacy groups began to gather momentum and political clout, the or- ganizations frequently turned to the govern- ment for action and remedies. McPhail / GENDER-BIAS HATE CRIMES 127 To begin to address the problemof hate crime, the prevalence of the problem was im- portant to establish. The Coalition on Hate Crimes Prevention was formed to sponsor the Hate Crimes Statistics Act (HCSA) at the federal level, which would require the U.S. Attorney General to gather and publish hate crime statis- tics on selected groups. The coalition was com- posed of civil rights, religious, peace, gay and lesbian, and ethnic groups (Jenness & Broad, 1997). Women's groups were noticeably absent. The first Congressional hearings on hate crime oc- curred in 1985 and cen- tered on the following three designated core cat- egories: race, religion, and ethnicity. However, between the introduction of the HCSA in 1985 and its passage in 1990, a pro- cess termed domain expan- sion occurred. Jenness and Grattet (2001) defined do- main expansion as ""when claimsmakers offer new definitions for and thus extend the bound- aries of the phenomenon under discussion"" (p. 54). In 1986, congressional hearings were held on antigay violence due to the influence and participation of GLBT agencies and organiza- tions, which resulted in the phrase ""homosexu- ality or heterosexuality"" being added to the bill before its passage in 1990. Despite the process of domain expansion, gender was not added at this time. At a HCSA hearing in 1988, Molly Yard, then-president of the National Organization for Women (NOW), submitted written testimony to be included in the record (Yard, 1988). Yard sought to amend the HCSA by adding gender as a protected cate- gory. She drew on feminist theory and research to demonstrate that the majority of violence committed against women occurs at the hands of men, often the result of misogyny. Yard de- scribed rape and heterosexual domestic vio- lence as tools of political oppression meant to keep women subordinate. She also included vi- olence against abortion providers and clinics as falling under the domain of hate crime. She noted two states already had included gender in their hate crime laws, both California and Min- nesota. Yard described the many parallels be- tween hate crimes and violence against women. She noted the irony that other social movement groups often used rape as an analogy for the harms that hate crimes do and yet refused to add protections for women, who are primarily the victims of rape. Yard stated, Just as ethnic, religious, homophobic, and racist vio- lence is motivated by hate, so also are rape, wife abuse, and anti-abortion terrorismand a host of other crimes directed at women. Until we accept this concept as a nation and act on the obvious, we can- not truly understand the scope and misogyny in American society and begin to eradicate the problem and eliminate the tragic and shameful results. (p. 17) Despite her testimony, gender as a category was not adopted. An editorial in a women's advocacy newslet- ter documents the deliberate exclusion of both the status category of gender fromthe HCSA and women's organizations from the policy- making process. In the winter of 1989, the National Organization for Women and the National Coalition Against Domes- tic Violence sought to rectify the exclusion of women fromthe bill through a series of meetings with the Coalition on Hate Crimes. Aside from the absence of any women's groups, the Coalition on Hate Crimes is an otherwise broad coalition of civil rights, reli- gious, peace, gay, and ethnic rights groups. In re- sponse to the women's arguments for inclusion, the member organizations of the Coalition on Hate Crimes were polled. They agreed unanimously that they would not support a Hate Crimes Bill that in- cluded gender. The Hate Crimes Coalition then can- celled all future meetings with the women's rights groups. (de Santis, 1990, p. 1) The reasons offered for the exclusion of women were both strategic and ideological. For in- stance, coalition members feared that adding gender would delay passage of the bill and sug- gested that gender be considered for inclusion at a later date (Copeland & Wolfe, 1991). Other rationales for excluding gender included fears that inclusion would open the door for other groups such as age and disability; would make the statistics-gathering requirement too cum- bersome due to the prevalence of violence 128 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE / April 2002 The first Congressional hearings on hate crime occurred in 1985 and centered on the following three designated core categories: race, religion, and ethnicity. against women; and that women do not fit the hate crimes paradigm because many of them know their attackers (Copeland & Wolfe, 1991). Apparently, an internal memorandum pre- pared by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) was influential in laying out the arguments both for including and excluding gender as a cate- gory (Freeman, 1990); however, the ADL does not make this document public today. Angelari (1994) commented on the Coalition's stance. Ironically the Coalition argued that ""without the in- clusion of sexual orientation in the act, there would be two standards. Crimes against gays and lesbians would be viewed as less significant, less pervasive, and less reprehensible than crimes motivated by ra- cial, religious, or ethnic prejudice."" That a coalition of religious, civil rights, and gay and lesbian organi- zations should fail to see that their actions relegated crimes against women to the same secondary posi- tion illustrates one of the major obstacles that women's advocates must overcome before violence against women will be treated as a hate crime. (p. 85) Therefore, gender was not included as a cate- gory for protection in the HCSA that passed in 1990, and statistics on gender-bias-motivated crime are not reported at the federal level with other hate crimes. Disability, both mental and physical, was added as a category in 1994 under a provision of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act (FBI, 1999a). Gender was often omitted at the state level as well. The ADL formulated a model statute in 1981 that was adopted by many states. How- ever, the statute did not include gender as a sta- tus category. This occurred in spite of the fact that the first hate crime law passed in the United States was in California in 1978, which included gender as a category. Perhaps due to its exclusion fromthe HCSA, 2 years later, Congress sought to address vio- lence against women in a separate bill, the Vio- lence Against Women Act (VAWA), which sub- sequently passed in 1994. The bill had multiple provisions including funding for victimser- vices, education, and training for members of the criminal justice system. The law also con- tained a historic civil rights provision, Title III, which declared for the first time that ""violent crimes motivated by the victim's gender are dis- criminatory and violate the victim's federal civil rights"" (Goldscheid & Kraham, 1995, p. 505). Al- though not specifically termed hate crime, this was the effect of Title III. Unfortunately, the U.S. Supreme Court declared this section of the VAWA unconstitutional in 2000. United States v. Morrison et al. held, by a 5-4 ruling, that Con- gress did not have the authority to legislate the civil rights provision under the basis of the ei- ther the Commerce Clause or the Fourteenth Amendment, which Congress had cited as sources of federal authority (United States v. Morrison et al. , 1999). In 1994, Congress passed a sentence enhance- ment law, the Hate Crimes Sentencing Enhance- ment Act of 1994 (HCSEA), which called for en- hancing sentences by no less than three offense levels for hate crimes. For the first time in fed- eral policy, the list of protected statuses in- cluded gender. Currently before Congress is the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act (for- merly termed the Hate Crimes Prevention Act) that seeks to expand hate crime coverage for three categories, gender, sexual orientation, and disability, as well as expanding the application of hate crime law to a greater sphere than cur- rently permitted. In a Senate hearing on this bill, gender as a status category was debated with several groups specifically addressing the in- clusion of gender including the Center for Women's Policy Studies, the NOW Legal De- fense and Education Fund, and GenderPAC (Combating Hate Crimes, 1999). Jenness and Grattet (2001) described the early policy process in which social movement orga- nizations were critical in defining the problem of hate crimes, specifying target status catego- ries to be included, and advocating for legal so- lutions. Women's organizations were not active in the process, sometimes even being deliber- ately shut out, as previously described. How- ever, a second wave of hate crimes policy mak- ing commenced that allowed gender to be added as a category in the VAWA, HCSEA, HCPA and more than 20 states (for a listing of states, see Lawrence, 1999, pp. 178-189). This top-down addition of gender can be attributed to the fact that gender was already a standard subject of state and federal discrimination law and, thus, became folded into hate crime policy by lawmakers rather than grassroots activists. McPhail / GENDER-BIAS HATE CRIMES 129 As part of this move to increasingly include gen- der as a status category, in 1996, the ADL added gender to its model hate crime statute (ADL, 1999). In the current hate crime policy arena, gender is often likely to be on the list of pro- tected statuses in proposed legislation. Earl and Soule (2001) found that states that had previously passed hate crime law were less likely to go back and add gender as a category. Looking at various factors that affected whether a state included gender in their hate crime law, Earl and Soule found high issue salience, high per capita income, and a low non-White population were predictors of the in- clusion of the status cate- gory of gender in the state statute. Also, states in the Pacific Northwest were more likely to include gender than southern states. When Steven M. Free- man, director of the ADL Legal Affairs Department and author of the 1990 ADL internal memoran- dum, was asked why his organization first excluded and then included gender as a category, he (Steven M. Freeman, personal communication, March 24, 2000) re- sponded, It would not be accurate to say that gender was first excluded, and then we had a change of heart. It would be more accurate to say that after we had some experience with the statute, the question was raised internally as to whether it should be broader than originally drafted. When we brought to our lay leadership the question of whether to include gen- der, the vote was affirmative. Freeman (Steven M. Freeman, personal com- munication, March 24, 2000) also offered the fol- lowing caveat: I would also point out that including ""gender"" as a category is different than including ""women,"" even though it is obvious that in most gender-based hate crimes, the victims are women. We regard it as le- gally and politically significant that people of differ- ent races, religions, national origins, sexual orienta- tions, and genders are covered by our language-- not merely minorities. Freeman's point is well taken. Although not widely acknowledged in the media, hate crime law protects people of any race, ethnicity/na- tional origin, all sexual orientations, religions, and both genders, no matter whether they are in the majority or minority. Therefore, men are protected when they are targeted due to their gender, as are women. In a newspaper search, only two instances were found in which crimes were successfully prosecuted on the basis of gender bias (Jordan, 1994; Perry, 2000). According to J. McDevitt (personal communication, October 4, 2001), the bar is being raised for prosecuting gender bias motivated crimes. For instance, in Massachu- setts, the criteria for prosecution require that ep- ithets uttered during the commission of the crime denigrate women as a class and that at least two restraining orders have been filed on a perpetrator by two different persons for hate crime charges to be filed in a domestic violence case. The history of the gender status category within the hate crime model is one of first exclu- sion and then gradual inclusion as hate crime policy became institutionalized. However, the inclusion of the category remains more sym- bolic than realized as it is rarely invoked and re- mains controversial. Less than one half of the states include gender in their hate crime laws. For many, the gender category remains an un- easy fit in the hate crime model. FITTING GENDER INTO THE HATE CRIME PARADIGM Although gender is frequently becoming a part of the hate crime policy template, its fit within the hate crime paradigm remains contro- versial. Weisburd and Levin (1994) noted, ""The theoretical fit between gender-motivated crimes of violence and traditional bias crimes is concedingly not an exact fit, but we believe it is a substantial one"" (p. 42). Following are reasons it is not an exact fit and arguments for both its ex- clusion and inclusion. 130 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE / April 2002 The history of the gender status category within the hate crime model is one of first exclusion and then gradual inclusion as hate crime policy became institutionalized. However, the inclusion of the category remains more symbolic than realized as it is rarely invoked and remains controversial. Reasons for an Uneasy Fit One reason gender fits less easily within a hate crime paradigm is the simple fact that it came later in time in the hate crime policy- making process. As mentioned earlier, the triad of race, ethnicity, and religion are considered ""core"" or ""classic"" status categories. The U.S. Attorney General charged the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with collecting hate crime statistics in accordance with the HCSA's man- date. To collect the data, the FBI had to develop guidelines to establish which criminal acts con- stitute bias crimes (FBI, 1999b). The agency built the guidelines around the statuses covered in the HCSA at that time; that is, race, religion, sex- ual orientation, and ethnicity/national origin. The guidelines direct investigators to assess specific factors in attributing bias. A few of the guidelines are (a) certain objects, items, or things that indicate bias were used (e.g., the of- fenders wore white sheets with hoods covering their faces or a burning cross was left in front of the victim's residence); (b) the victim was en- gaged in activities promoting his/her race, reli- gion, disability, sexual orientation, or ethnicity/ national origin (e.g., the victim was a member of the NAACP or participated in gay rights dem- onstrations); and (c) the incident coincided with a holiday or date of particular significance relat- ing to race, religion, disability, sexual orienta- tion, or ethnicity/national origin (e.g., Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Rosh Hashanah, and so forth) (FBI, 1999b). Although the guidelines give concrete exam- ples that refer to race, religion, and sexual orien- tation, none of the examples presented for clari- fication refer to gender. Subsequent federal training manuals also did not mention gender (see for example, McLaughlin, Brilliant, & Lang, 1995). As a result, the racial animus model be- came the prototypical hate crime and the racial animus offender became the prototypical of- fender (Wang, 1997). The ""typical"" hate crime is often used as a measure by police officers who often compare the crime to a typical hate crime to see if it meets certain criteria; that is, no prov- ocation by the victim, a specific target, no prior encounter between victims and perpetrator, and accompanying derogatory remarks (Boyd, Berk, & Hamner, 1996). Therefore, one reason gender fits less well, at times, into the hate crime paradigmis merely because the policy was tai- lored around the inclusion of the other spe- cific status categories and the exclusion of gender. The status category of gender comes in as a second-tier hate crime, which may allow it to be treated differently, and perhaps not as seri- ously as the top tier hate crimes of race, religion, and ethnicity/national origin. It is also interesting to note that the FBI deter- mined that it was not necessary to create new crime categories but instead collect additional information, primarily on bias motivation, on crimes currently reported to the Uniform Crime Report (UCR) program(FBI, 1997). Ironically, 1 of the 11 traditional offenses named included ""forcible rape."" Because under the HCSA the category of gender was not recognized as a sta- tus category, the rape of a woman is not a hate crime unless the victim is sexually assaulted be- cause of the perpetrator's bias due to her race, religion, ethnicity/national origin, sexual ori- entation, disability, or religion. Other reasons why gender-bias crimes are of- ten not viewed as hate crimes are more struc- tural and represent institutionalismsexism. As Choundas (1995) explained, ""Habitual precon- ceptions, unexamined assumptions, and un- considered judgments--as invidious and damaging as more deliberate prejudices when finally implemented into discriminatory disad- vantaging--are the evasive phenomena most reliably suspected as yielding the exclusion of gender-crime victims from enhanced protec- tion"" (p. 1162). For instance, society's continued belief in rape myths and separation of the public and private spheres continue to cause violence against women to be seen in a different, and of- ten less serious, light. A painful example is dem- onstrated by the words of Senator Orin Hatch (R-Utah) during a Congressional hearing on the VAWA (cited in Gaffney, 1997): Say you have a man who believes a woman is attrac- tive. He feels encouraged by her and he's so moti- vated by that encouragement that he rips her clothes off and has sex with her against her will. Now let's say you have another man who grabs a woman off some lonely road and in the process of raping her says words like, ""You're wearing a skirt! You're a McPhail / GENDER-BIAS HATE CRIMES 131 woman! I hate women! I'm going to show you, you woman!"" Now the first one's terrible. But the other's much worse. If a man rapes a woman while telling her he loves her, that's a far cry fromsaying he hates her. A lust factor does not spring fromanimus. (p. 259) In this case, clearly rape myth acceptance and ignorance by policy makers play a role in not understanding gender-based violence. The so- cialization of sex roles, gender stereotypes and expectations, the historic legacy of minimizing violence against women, and the male justifica- tion of rape all play a part in not recognizing vi- olence against women as a hate crime. Choundas (1995) offered two additional rea- sons that cause people to miss seeing violence against women in the same light as racial or reli- gious prejudice: its preva- lence and the fact that women constitute half the population. These two factors make violence against women look like ""essentially randomand unrelated manifesta- tions"" (p. 1082). When women make up more than half the population, they do not fit the model of a powerless minority. Another reason for not seeing women as fit- ting a hate crimes model is the acceptance of lib- eral rather than radical feminist perspective to explain violence against women. Largely due to the work of liberal feminists, violence against women has received increased attention, fund- ing, and legal reform. However, the liberal femi- nist perspective focuses on gaining equality with men in the public sphere, often without ex- plicating the root causes of the inequalities. However, a radical feminist perspective ac- knowledges the existence of a patriarchy in which violence is used as a tool of male oppres- sion. For instance, Brownmiller (1975) wrote, Fromprehistoric times to the present, I believe rape has played a critical function. It is nothing more or less than a conscious process of intimidation by which all men keep all women in a state of fear. (pp. 14- 15) The radical feminist perspective is not widely accepted by policy makers and hate crime ac- tors, leading to the conceptualization of vio- lence against women as personal and individual, not political. A radical feminist per- spective more firmly situates the category of gender within the hate crime paradigm, whereas a liberal feminist perspective primarily seeks legal safeguards without addressing the underlying causes or motivations of violence against women. Arguments Against Gender Fitting in a Hate Crime Paradigm There are many arguments made why gender should not be included as a category in hate crime policy. Opponents of gender inclusion of- ten fail to see gender fitting the standard bias crime model; that is, ""the victim is attacked be- cause he [sic] possesses the group characteris- tic"" (Lawrence, 1999, p. 14). Hate crime logic often posits that victims are interchangeable and that victims have little or no preexisting re- lationship with the perpetrator. The fact that many female victims know their attackers pre- cludes some advocates and policy makers from fitting rape and domestic violence into a hate crime model. However, Lawrence (1999) pro- vided a helpful rebuttal of this assertion. The existence of a prior relationship between victim and perpetrator, moreover, is not incompatible with the existence of a bias crime. The lack of prior rela- tionship may be a description of most bias crimes, but it is not a sine qua non for all bias crimes. (p. 16) Unfortunately, many hate crimes are perpe- trated on neighbors and coworkers. Making a prior relationship a disqualification of hate crime status would exempt these crimes as well. There is a long history of a prior relationship between an offender and victimcausing vio- lence against women to be viewed in a different, less serious, light. For instance, traditionally, most state sexual assault laws included a ""mari- tal rape exemption"" clause that specifically ex- cluded the husband fromprosecution for raping his wife. The use of a prior relationship to ex- clude hate crime determination is just the latest 132 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE / April 2002 The fact that many female victims know their attackers precludes some advocates and policy makers from fitting rape and domestic violence into a hate crime model. in a long line of justifications for using a woman's acquaintance with her attacker to min- imize and rationalize violence. In response, Pendo (1994) stated, ""In fact, the previous rela- tionship makes the crime more heinous because the sense of connection and shared community implied in social familiarity is viciously shat- tered"" (p. 168). How far this standard can be pushed was demonstrated in a successful prosecution of gender-motivated violence under the California hate crime law. In this case, the perpetrator was accused of attacking five women. In four of the attacks, the man, who was unknown to all of the women, approached them with a question or a comment. The women generally responded with a few words before moving away, and then were physically assaulted by the perpetrator. In the fifth attack, the man knocked a female victim to the ground without either of themsaying a word, causing her to suffer a fractured skull. Al- though there was a pattern of discriminatory se- lection of women for attack, the jury made a dis- tinction between the five cases. The assault in which the woman spoke not a word to him was deemed a hate crime, and the other four assaults were termed ""misdemeanor battery."" Because the other four women had exchanged a few words with the assailant, they were determined to have ""spurned his advances"" and therefore the perpetrator's motivation was deemed their rejection of himrather than his bias toward women (Perry, 2000). Prosecutor Deputy Dis- trict Attorney Hector Jimenez, head of the hate crime prosecution unit, reported that the mixed verdict revealed the difficulty of using the hate crime statute in attacks on women (Perry, 2000). Lesbian battering is also an uneasy fit into the hate crime paradigm. Not only does it have the same intimacy element problems that hetero- sexual violence does, in addition the perpetra- tors are of the same gender and the same sexual orientation. This would generally preclude it from being termed a hate crime because the FBI guidelines state that the perpetrator and victims must be from different status categories (FBI, 1999b). However, the primary distinction of a hate crime is that it was committed due to bias against the group. In a review of the literature, West (1998) found that battering within lesbian relationships is often caused by the same factors as within heterosexual violence, such as sub- stance abuse, a family history of violence, de- pendency/autonomy issues, and power imbal- ances. However, an untested but strongly suggested underlying dynamic is that of inter- nalized homophobia (West, 1998). That is, soci- etal discrimination and hatred of homosexuals is turned inward, and then outward, in acts of violence toward a lesbian partner. With this un- derstanding, lesbian battering could fit the hate crime paradigm; that is, the violence was a re- sult of bias against a group, despite the fact that the perpetrator belongs to the same group. Such an argument, however, would be a stretch of the hate crime paradigm and most likely deemed an uneasy fit, as is gender generally. Heretofore, hate crimes due to sexual orientation bias is largely recognized, researched, and discussed when heterosexuals target GBLT victims. Clearly, lesbian battering is an area that war- rants further exploration and discussion with regard to its fit in the hate crime framework. Another argument often cited in the dis- avowal of gender as a status category is the fact that there are already special laws that address violence against women, such as sexual assault and domestic violence laws. Although this is true, these laws do not always provide the re- dress and justice sought by survivors of vio- lence. For instance, the report The Response to Rape: Detours on the Road to Equal Justice, pre- pared by the majority staff of the Senate Judi- ciary Committee (1993), found that (a) more than half of all rape prosecutions result in either a dismissal or acquittal; (b) a rape prosecution is more than twice as likely as a murder prosecu- tion to be dismissed and 30% more likely to be dismissed than a robbery; (c) almost one quarter of convicted rapists are not sentenced to prison but instead are released on probation; and (d) 98% of rape victims will never see their at- tacker apprehended, convicted, and incarcer- ated. Although laws are in place, and certainly are an improvement over even a decade ago, clearly the laws as they stand do not adequately address issues of violence against women. Adding gender as a category in hate crime laws could give prosecutors and police officers new tools to secure convictions, give convicted of- McPhail / GENDER-BIAS HATE CRIMES 133 fenders enhanced penalties, and give the public a better understanding of the motivations of much of the violence committed against women. Declaration of the unconstitutionality of the VAWA Title III civil rights provision only adds to this argument. Another reason given for exclusion of gender as a category is less ideological and more logisti- cal. For instance, some opponents fear the addi- tion of gender into hate crime categories will overwhelmdata-collection efforts. Goldscheid (1999) responded to that argument, Perhaps the principal or underlying objection to treating domestic violence and sexual assaults as civil rights cases is the staggering number of those crimes committed each year. Yet it would be an ab- surd perversion of our justice systemif the preva- lence of a problembecame the justification for ignoring it. (p. 151) A related fear is that with violence against women being so prevalent, including gender as a status category would make the other status categories look less important and frequent in comparison. The final argument most often given for the exclusion of gender concerns the perpetrator's motivation. That is, some argue that men who attack and assault women do not necessarily hate them. Although this can be true, it is true for all other status categories as well. As previ- ously addressed, ""hate"" crime is less about hate than bias or prejudice. Weisburd and Levin (1994) noted, ""The key to bias crime categorization is not really about the hateful 'specific intent' of the offender, but rather the offender's discrimina- tory use of violence to en- force a particular social hierarchy that is biased against the targeted status category"" (p. 36). Jenness and Grattet (2001) re- ported that recent judicial decisions on hate crime cases have shifted the fo- cus fromthe offender's motivation to the offender's discriminatory se- lection of his victim. Women are both discriminatorily selected on the basis of their gender and also due to animus, in this case, misogyny, as well as other motiva- tions. In one report of the motives of rapists (Scully & Marolla, 1985), perpetrators admitted a variety of motivations, many of which fell into either the discriminatory selection model or the animus model, or both. Several of the stated rea- sons included motives of power, collective lia- bility, and sexual access to unwilling women, as well as recreation, adventure, or a fantasy come true. The authors noted, We found that rape was frequently a means of re- venge and punishment. Implicit in revenge-rapes was the notion that women were collectively liable for the rapists' problems. In some cases, victims were substitutes for significant women on whom the men desired revenge. In other cases, victims were thought to represent all women, and rape was used to punish, humiliate, and ""put them in their place."" In both cases, women were seen as a class, a category, not as individuals. (p. 261) Also, it is important to note that in other types of hate crimes, the motives are mixed as well and not always about hate. For instance, Frank- lin's (1998) interviews with men who had per- petrated assaults on gay men found ""multiple determinism"" rather than simple accounts of motivation such as hate or repressed homosexu- ality. Men used this crime for ""demonstrating their masculinity, garnering social approval, and alleviating boredom"" (p. 19). Franklin com- pared the similarities between men who are ""gay-bashers"" and men who rape women be- cause, in both groups, the offenders often act in a peer context in which the victimis an object, ""a dramatic prop, a vehicle for ritualized con- quest"" (p. 12). Our society in general seems reluctant to la- bel male violence against women due to ""hate."" Individual mental or moral defects in the man or provocation by the woman are much more readily accepted by laypersons. Pharr (1990) noted an irony in this, ""'Man-hater' is a com- mon expression but 'woman-hater' is not, de- spite the brutal evidence of woman-hating that 134 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE / April 2002 Our society in general seems reluctant to label male violence against women due to ""hate."" Individual mental or moral defects in the man or provocation by the woman are much more readily accepted by laypersons. surrounds us: murder, rape, battering, incest"" (p. 3). Arguments for Gender Fitting in a Hate Crime Paradigm Violence against women fits the hate crime paradigm when women are selected as victims due to their gender (discriminatory selection model) or due to the perpetrator's hatred of women (animus model). In either case, women are targeted because they are women. Many crimes committed against women fit these mod- els, such as rape, domestic violence, and mur- ders of women in which men are the primary perpetrators and women the primary victims. One criteria of a hate crime is that offender and perpetrator(s) are fromdifferent groups. Although same-sex violence occurs, violence against women is primarily committed by men. However, just like any other crime, the facts of the case must be weighed to make a judgment of whether it meets the criteria of hate crime. The formulation of violence against women as hate crime fits with radical feminist theories of violence that emerged with the women's movement. One of the major successes of the women's movement was transforming the conceptualiza- tion of violence against women from a personal problemof individual men to a political process meant to subordinate women. MacKinnon (1991) presented the radical feminist perspec- tive when she stated, ""Women are sexually as- saulted because they are women; not individually or at random, but on the basis of sex, because of their membership in a group de- fined by gender"" (p. 1301). Caputi and Russell (1992) term the murder of women femicide, that is, ""the most extreme form of sexist terrorism, motivated by hatred, contempt, pleasure, or a sense of ownership of women"" (p. 15). What may be ""new"" arguments for many actors within the hate crime policy domain are actually old arguments within the feminist movement. This hatred of women and the discriminatory selection of women for violence meets the broad ideological basis for hate crime. One horrific in- cident of violence against women is frequently held up as the hallmark of gender-biased hate crime. The crime occurred in Montreal, Canada, on December 6, 1989, at the University of Mon- treal. Caputi and Russell (1992) described the massacre. On that day, 25 year-old combat magazine aficio- nado Marc Lepin suited up for war and rushed the school of engineering. In one classroom, he sepa- rated the women from the men, ordered the men out, and, shouting, ""You're all fucking feminists,"" opened fire on the women. During a half-hour ram- page, Lepin killed 14 young women, wounded 9 other women and 4 men, and then turned the gun on himself. A three-page suicide note blamed all of his failures on women, whom he felt had rejected him and scorned him. Also found on his body was a hit- list of 15 prominent Canadian women. (p. 13) This horrific crime is almost unanimously agreed to be a hate crime and opened the door for viewing other violence against women as gender-bias hate crime. The rape of women is almost always a hate crime, one exception possibly being statutory rape. Senator Joseph Biden (D-Delaware), pri- mary sponsor of the VAWA, stated, ""Theo- retically, I guess, a rape could take place that was not driven by gender animus, but I can't think of what it would be"" (cited in Gaffney, 1997, p. 260). Gaffney suggested that gender an- imus is present in all sexual assault cases and recommends that courts adopt a rebuttable pre- sumption of gender animus in rape cases. Domestic violence can also fit the hate crime model, as the violence is often a repeated and patterned attack on women. Serial and repeated attacks by a perpetrator are often characteristic of hate crimes. Gender-biased epithets are com- mon during a hate crime assault and such lan- guage is common in domestic abuse of a woman by her male partner (NiCarthy, 1986). Goldscheid (1999) noted that women who are battered are particularly vulnerable when they are pregnant, when their ""femaleness"" is most apparent. She also noted a pattern of battering violence either with one woman over a long pe- riod of time or with multiple women. A man in New Hampshire became the first man in his state to be sentenced under a hate crime law due to gender-biased violence (Jordan, 1994). His history of violence toward women along with repeated referrals to women with ""degrading, McPhail / GENDER-BIAS HATE CRIMES 135 insulting, and intimidating words"" put him in the same category of someone acting out of ra- cial or religious bigotry according to the judge. Again, epithets that target the victim's group status are often a hallmark of hate crimes. Women being attacked are often termed ""bitches,"" ""cunts,"" and ""whores,"" words that target their femaleness. Another hallmark of hate crime is the harm it does to the victim's com- munity in addition to the individual victim(s). For instance, although not all women are raped, most women fear rape (Gordon & Riger, 1989). Women al- ter their daily lives in nu- merous ways to avoid the violent behavior of men. Choundas (1995) noted, ""While potential victims of racial, ethnic, or reli- gious violence might attempt to avoid certain neighborhoods in which prejudice might run particularly rampant, women remain safe from street harassment and violent assault only by staying out of those areas known as public"" (pp. 1090-1091). And yet, even in ""private,"" women are not safe fromthe hands of intimate partners. Again, this intimate relationship often cloaks the reality of the violence. Characteristics of hate crime also include the pervasive social harmsuch acts inflict on society in general. In this case, the pervasive social harmto women includes constant threats of vio- lence and restrictions on freedomto move about the world, which may impinge on economic op- portunities. Domestic violence also inflicts harms on the institution of the family, adds costs and dangers to the workplace, has links to crim- inal and suicidal tendencies, and instills violent propensities in the next generation of males (Choundas, 1995). Another characteristic of hate crime is whether the target community perceives it as a hate crime. This was the case in the following example. In November 1994 at the University of New Mexico's Zimmerman Library, more than 100 bound volumes of gender and gay studies journals were taken, and those left defaced with swastikas and scrawled messages such as ""Where is your bitch propaganda?"" (Hood & Rollins, 1995). Although some university ad- ministrators and faculty saw the crime as a mat- ter of censorship or a prank (especially when the volumes were later found hidden in the library), feminist faculty and staff defined it as a hate crime. The next year, the Board of Regents passed a hate crime policy, which included gen- der as a category, with the library incident noted by local press as a motivating factor. Finally, several other factors, often particu- lars of the crime, make gender-bias violence fit the hate crime paradigm. Levin (Webb, 1994) be- lieved violence against women is a hate crime because it is often characterized by (a) hate lan- guage, (b) the absence of another motive (such as robbery), (c) excessive brutality including genital and breast mutilation, (d) lack of provo- cation, and (e) victims suffer long-term harm. Perpetrators of hate crime are often young men in groups (Levin & McDevitt, 1993), which is of- ten characteristic of violence against women, es- pecially gang rapes. Another criteria of hate crime is that the characteristic the victim is tar- geted for is an immutable one; that is, the person cannot change it. Therefore, the person is pow- erless to avoid being targeted, now or in the fu- ture. Although transgenderists and postmod- ernists would disagree, gender is generally viewed as an immutable trait. Transgendered individuals are often themselves targets of hate crime, and recent legislation in California in- cludes transsexuals as a protected category (Jenness & Grattet, 2001). Gender Inclusion Benefits The policy benefits of having gender as a sta- tus within hate crime policy are numerous. Per- haps the primary benefit is the one cited by Weisburd and Levin (1994), ""By recognizing the group-based animosity underlying these vic- timizations, we not only decry the violence but also take the first step in confronting the under- lying attitude that allows the violence to occur"" (p. 41). The solutions to social problems are de- termined by the definitions attributed to the problems. If the problem is identified as per- sonal and individual, as violence against 136 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE / April 2002 Another hallmark of hate crime is the harm it does to the victim's community in addition to the individual victim(s). For instance, although not all women are raped, most women fear rape. women has been considered for so long, then so- lutions will follow that individualized model. Placing gender in its proper place among hate crimes redefines the problem as public and po- litical, causing the victims to be viewed as wor- thy of legal redress instead of blame. Angelari (1994) listed other benefits includ- ing new legal remedies and increased public awareness of the seriousness and prevalence of violence against women. The new legal reme- dies include increased penalties, which provide incentives for police and prosecutors to take vi- olence against women more seriously, opportu- nities to seek civil remedies, damages in civil award suits to pay for treatment, civil suits offering emotional reward for establishing guilt of the attacker, and offering ""victims of gender bias-motivated violence confirmation that their suffering is part of a greater, and regretfully un- addressed, social problemof violence against women"" (p. 102). A rape survivor hauntingly spoke (Kalven, 1999) of this connection to the larger group of victimized women: ""I feel in touch with something so large. I felt it from the first moments. I feel connected to cavewomen, to women who've been raped through history. It's like a weight, bearing down on me"" (p. 142). The benefit of increasing public awareness of the seriousness of violence against women is that it (a) directs attention away fromrape myths and onto motives of hate, power, and control, (b) shifts attention away fromthe victim and on to the motives and actions of the perpe- trators, and (c) also moves attention away from the relationship and onto the violence. A shift in focus on motivation fromvictimto perpetrator would change the questions asked of the victim from""Why don't you leave?"" and ""What were you wearing?"" to asking the perpetrator ""Why did you target women?"" and ""What part does misogyny play in this violence?"" Also, such a shift changes treatment of the perpetrator in ways already practiced within the feminist com- munity; that is, having rapists or domestic vio- lence abusers recognize that they have more than a problemwith individual women but a problemwith how they view and treat women more generally (Gondolf & Russell, 1987). To increase the rewards of recognizing gen- der as a status category, the interaction of gen- der with other status categories must also be ac- knowledged. Not to do so unnecessary limits the understanding of hate crime as it applies to women and serves to make many women invis- ible, especially women who occupy multiple status categories. GENDER ESSENTIALISM Hate crime policy is largely focused on pro- viding increased protection and remedies for specific, targeted groups of people based pri- marily on a history of discriminatory practices and widespread prejudice expressed toward their group. This division of people into speci- fied categories can be a source of contention. For instance, Jacobs and Potter (1998) criticized such categorization as leading to identity poli- tics and the ""Balkanization of American soci- ety"" (p. 8). Harris also offered a critique of cate- gorization, however, based on a much different premise. Harris (1993) was critical of feminist legal theorists who speak of ""gender"" as though it were both universal and separate from other systems of domination. Harris de- fined ""gender essentialism"" as ""the notion that there is a monolithic 'women's experience' that can be described independent of other facets of experience like race, class, and sexual orienta- tion"" (p. 348). Throughout this article, and much of the hate crime policy domain, status categories are spo- ken of as if they were discrete and separate cate- gories. Such notions not only create divisions between categories of people, they fail to recog- nize that people occupy multiple categories. By ignoring people who fall within multiple tar- geted status categories, it is often women who are made invisible. The FBI defines a multiple- bias incident as ""any hate crime incident in which one or more of the offenses were commit- ted as a result of two or more bias motivations"" (FBI, 1999a, p. 7). However, the category is little used. In 1999, when the FBI reported 9,301 hate crime offenses, only 10 were recorded as multiple-bias incidents. Ignoring multiple status categories in theo- retical discussions as well as statistical report- ing leaves gender out of the picture. For in- stance, Jenness and Broad (1994) noted how the McPhail / GENDER-BIAS HATE CRIMES 137 gay and lesbian antiviolence projects have adopted many of the strategies of the women's movement's antiviolence projects without adopting a gendered understanding of vio- lence. Ault (1997) echoed this point by noting that gay and lesbian antiviolence projects often fail to note the connections between sexual ori- entation and gender discrimination, resulting in the assumption that lesbian women have more in common with gay men than heterosexual women. Another assumption follows: that is, that attacks on gays and lesbians are exclusively due to homophobia and not misogyny. Attacks on gay men may be due to misogyny, due to their perceived similarity with women, as well as homophobia. Hate crimes against lesbian women are often attributed solely to homophobia rather than some combination of homophobia and misog- yny. Such discrete catego- rizations ""create a false dichotomy between the categories 'lesbian' and 'woman' and 'anti-lesbian' and 'anti-woman.' Anti-lesbian is quintessentially anti-woman; vi- olence against women of all sexual orientations is often overtly 'anti-lesbian' "" (Ault, 1997, p. 59). Not including gender as a category creates problems for women who are hate crime vic- tims. Pharr (1990) questioned, When hate crimes are limited to anti-Semitic, racist, and homophobic violence, there is inherent confu- sion: when Jewish women are killed, when women of color are killed, when lesbians are raped or killed, it is often impossible to determine if they were at- tacked because of their reli- gion, race, sexual identity, or their gender. (p. 2) Police often have diffi- culty determining motive when there are multiple identities. In her study of the identification of hate crimes by police officers, Martin (1995) related the problemwith determin- ing motive in the follow- ing two cases involving women of color. In one incident, two African American women were so- liciting for a charity door to door. A White homeowner yelled at them, ""Get the fuck out, niggers!"" and then chased themdown the street while he was naked. The police determined this to be a racial incident because the man yelled ""niggers,"" but noted in their report that he prob- ably would not have done the same to two Afri- can American men. Another incident occurred when a White man in a car yelled, ""move, you Black nigger bitch mother fucker!"" which was recorded by the police as racial harassment. However, the victimis noted to have said, ""If I were a man he wouldn't have done that"" (Mar- tin, 1995, p. 321). Harris listed reasons why gender essential- ismis so attractive: (a) as a matter of intellectual convenience, it is easy; (b) essentialismrepre- sents emotional safety; (c) it provides opportu- nities for power games and hierarchies of op- pression; and (d) cognitively, it provides a way of organizing data, even at the cost of leaving some data and experiences out. Such a gender essentialist focus does have problematic conse- quences in hate crime policy. For instance, en- hanced penalties are often seen as a solution to hate crime, which may disproportionately affect men of color because they are likely to face in- creased discrimination in the criminal justice system(Angelari, 1994). African American women may be less likely to support penalty en- hancements due to their unique vantage point at the intersection of race and gender. Violence against women also may be very different for various subgroups of women. For example, race and rape intersect to make a very different expe- rience, especially for African American women because of the legacy of rape during eras of slav- ery, Reconstruction, and JimCrow (Davis, 1981). Having a checkmark for ""multiple bias"" is not enough. It is more than a bookkeeping or ac- counting problem. The result of category essentialismis that the gendered nature of much violence is once again ignored or marginalized, especially as it affects women who are targeted due to their membership in multiple targeted status categories. The interconnections among 138 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE / April 2002 Hate crimes against lesbian women are often attributed solely to homophobia rather than some combination of homophobia and misogyny. The result of category essentialism is that the gendered nature of much violence is once again ignored or marginalized, especially as it affects women who are targeted due to their membership in multiple targeted status categories. systems of oppression have been brought to the forefront by numerous women of color theo- rists, including Davis (1981) and Collins (2000). Collins used the terms ""intersectionality"" and ""matrix of domination"" to describe the intercon- nections of oppressions. Intersectionality is de- fined as the ""particular forms of intersecting oppressions, for example, intersections of race and gender, or of sexuality and nation"" (p. 18). For example, a female Muslim hate crime victim may be acknowledged, but the bias is often solely attributed to her religion rather than a combination of her gender and religion. In the hate crime literature, the intersections are ig- nored, which often leads to a marginalization of the gendered nature of violence. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH, PRACTICE, AND POLICY Gender as a status category has taken a de- tour on the road to hate crime policy acceptance but is traveling the road nonetheless. Although still not universally included in hate crime pol- icy, gender is frequently included as a status cat- egory. However, victory cannot yet be claimed. There are still struggles ahead to keep gender in the paradigm, to see that the policy is effectively implemented, and to face the new challenges that lie ahead. There is concern that the policies will be viewed as more symbolic rather than to be practically implemented. There is also con- cern about the institutionalization of these poli- cies as the law enforcement community imple- ments them. The implications for research, practice, and policy will be discussed. Research Because the hate crime domain is still in its in- fancy, research is needed in all areas of hate crime in general and gender bias in particular. Currently, much of the literature on gender-bias violence consists of conceptual arguments within legal circles and little empirical research. The research focus must include gender bias and the multiple statuses of many targeted women. One specific research suggestion in- cludes surveying law enforcement officials to determine their knowledge of, and interest in, identifying and prosecuting gender-bias hate crimes. Additional calls for research are in- cluded in two new hate crime reports (Green, McFalls, & Smith, 2001; McDevitt, Balboni, & Bennett, 2000). Practice Practice implications include developing and implementing training programs for police offi- cers, judges, and prosecutors on gender-bias crimes. Although hate crime training is avail- able, often it does not include the category of gender. Such training also would need to be evaluated to determine its effectiveness in rais- ing both awareness and knowledge of gender- bias hate crimes and whether that awareness or knowledge translates into specific actions and protections for women. Models for training could include programs often provided by women's rape crisis and domestic violence pro- grams to police cadets and officers. Theoretical models most appropriate would be radical fem- inist theory or social dominance theory (SDT). SDT posits that all human societies are struc- tured as systems of group-based hierarchies, which includes a gender systemin which males have disproportionate power over females (Sidanius & Pratto, 1999). Education for the gen- eral public would also be beneficial. Programs addressed to elementary, secondary, and higher education students could focus on preventing hate crimes through increased acceptance and tolerance while dismantling hierarchies and promoting equality. Because women's organizations were shut out of the initial policy process, they must be in- vited into the process. Because the gender com- ponent came from top-down rather than from women's activists, a first step might be for women's organizations to learn about how gen- der fits within the hate crime paradigm. Al- though this is occurring at the national level among women's organizations, it does not ap- pear to be happening at the state and local lev- els. A discussion should ensue on how to best address violence against women to ensure the best use of scarce resources. Women's organiza- tions must be informed about the potential ben- efits of categorizing violence against women as McPhail / GENDER-BIAS HATE CRIMES 139 gender-bias hate crimes. Armed with such knowledge, women's organizations can once again take the lead in both training and moni- toring the implementation of the law. Maroney (1998) suggested advocacy groups develop leadership at the regional and national levels, formlong-lasting coalitions and resist di- visiveness between status categories, and resist seeing hate crime legislation as an end unto it- self or a substitute for real systemic change. Elaborating on the last point, Maroney re- minded us, It is possible to support anti-hate crime measures without supporting the more controversial and resource-heavy demands of disenfranchised groups for equality in housing, education, wealth, and sex- ual freedoms. Doing so allows government authori- ties to condemn the most extreme manifestations of prejudice without committing to eradication of lesser, more pervasive forms. (pp. 584-585) Addressing discriminatory violence against women is merely one piece of a wider agenda to improve the status of women. Policy Another focus must be on policy. The focus on policy must include monitoring the imple- mentation of hate crime policy, including the possibility of unintended consequences. Policy concerns include continuing to add gender as a status category to state and federal policies as well as revising FBI and other guidelines to in- clude gender examples. Women's organizations can join with hate crime coalitions to work on a state-by-state basis to ensure gender is a status category in all 50 states. Maroney (1998) cau- tioned that hate crime law is now in the hands of the criminal justice system whose views of hate crime might differ from the advocacy groups that successfully proposed the laws. One con- cern is that the law may be used to against those people it was intended to protect. Angelari (1994) noted that policies meant to protect women have had unintended consequences, such as the dual arrests of both parties under mandatory arrest policies in domestic violence cases. Monitoring policy implementation is nec- essary to see that legislative intent is carried out and that no unintended consequences befall women as a class. McDevitt et al. (2000) suggested that the FBI convene a working group to discuss the inclu- sion of gender in its national report because many states are beginning to collect local statis- tics. Statistics on violence against women are notoriously underreported and subject to con- troversy. Including the number of women who are victims of gender-bias assaults in the na- tional report will pose unique difficulties. The FBI and other law enforcement guidelines must also be rewritten to include examples that in- clude gender. Such examples might include adding ""Take Back the Night Marches"" to gay and lesbian pride parades and Martin Luther King, Jr. Day celebrations. It would include add- ing gender-bias epithets or other comments in- cluding stereotypical and derogatory state- ments about women as a class or group. Such statements often include blaming women for provoking or deserving the attack and blaming women for the perpetrator's present position or difficulties either during the commission or af- ter the commission of the crime. Again, the mul- tiple statuses of women must be taken into ac- count in developing the FBI guidelines. That is, investigators must ask if the crime was moti- vated in part by the victim's race, religion, or sexual orientation, but also in conjunction with the victim's gender. Maroney (1998) warned of the potential dan- ger when hate crime becomes institutionalized. Anti-hate crime efforts, once adopted, have come firmly within the control of the legislators, govern- ment authorities, police, prosecutors, and judges that shape and implement them. That institutional control, coupled with inadequate movement activity outside of those institutions, has frustrated larger at- tempts to alter systemic mistreatment of hate crime. (p. 598) Maroney detailed many present and potential problems, such as the bias of police officers, prosecutors, and judges who have much discre- tion; law enforcement's tendency to only ad- dress ""extraordinary cases""; the possibility of selective enforcement with target communities having the laws turned against them; and the irony of having the police, who are guilty of 140 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE / April 2002 many hate crimes themselves, responsible for apprehending other bias offenders. This latter situation is directly applicable to violence against women as police officers have fre- quently been charged with domestic violence, rape, sexual harassment, and other misogynist assaults either against women in their personal lives or women they encounter in the course of their work. Gelber (2000) raised different concerns about hate crime policies: ""While the logic of hate crime categorisation seems readily extendable to incorporate certain crimes against women, the hate crime argument begins to raise ques- tions which challenge assumptions about the usefulness of hate crime legislation."" She is con- cerned about how the laws might be applied in- appropriately or inconsistently, also sharing concerns that penalty-enhancement laws might disproportionately punish already marginal- ized populations. Gelber suggested a shift in fo- cus to monitoring hate crimes, community edu- cation to raise awareness, and greater provision of services to victims. CONCLUSION Clearly, the case for gender fitting a hate crime paradigm can be made. However, there is much room to debate when and how it should be incorporated into the violence against women movement. There is a danger that in incorporat- ing women into the hate crime paradigm, the model is stretched so thin that it collapses. The gender bias hate crime model is in its infancy; much work needs to be done to assess its effec- tiveness in its adolescence. Violence against women is a serious problem. Only time and con- tinued analyses will tell if the hate crime para- digmoffers effective solutions and strategies for violence against women rather than a symbolic gesture with few real protections. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE, POLICY, AND RESEARCH Much more research is needed to fully understand all aspects of hate crimes, especially as it concerns vi- olence against women. Such research could include surveys of police and prosecutors to determine their level of knowledge of, and commitment to, prosecut- ing gender-bias crimes. Because the hate crime laws on the books are so new, it is imperative to monitor and evaluate the effects of the policy to determine if the policy is being used and how or whether the policy will remain a sym- bolic gesture, especially with regard to women. Training materials must be developed for law en- forcement personnel, including police officers, pros- ecutors, and judges, that specifically address gender-bias hate crimes. The effectiveness of such training must be evaluated. Because most state and local women's organizations were not on the forefront of the movement to add gender as a status category to hate crime policy, women's advocacy groups must be educated about the possibilities of gender-bias hate crime policy and become involved in the monitoring of policy imple- mentation as well as the training of law enforcement officials. Better data collection must be mandated to enable researchers and advocates to track the number of hate crimes reported, the number of hate crimes charged, and the subsequent number of prosecu- tions, both successful and unsuccessful, including the category of gender. The FBI must begin to in- clude gender-bias hate crimes and gender examples in the guidelines in its data collection efforts. Advocacy at both the state and federal level is neces- sary to ensure that gender as a status category con- tinues to be proposed and adopted in subsequent hate crime legislation. Fewer than half of the states currently include gender as a status category. A greater understanding of multiple status catego- ries is necessary to determine the interaction be- tween gender and other status categories such as race, religion, and sexual orientation. Training of law enforcement personnel must include this vital topic. Training in gender-bias crimes must also include public awareness and education. Common percep- tions of violence against women lead members of the public to ask, ""What was she wearing when she was raped?"" in instances of sexual assault and, ""Why doesn't she just leave?"" in instances of domes- tic violence. Through the lens of the hate crime para- digm, more appropriate questions would look at the motivations of the perpetrator rather than the vic- tim, asking, ""Did he select a victim based on gen- McPhail / GENDER-BIAS HATE CRIMES 141 Clearly, the case for gender fitting a hate crime paradigm can be made. However, there is much room to debate when and how it should be incorporated into the violence against women movement. der?"" and ""Does he have a pattern of assaults upon women?"" Treatment programs for offenders and victim ser- vices must include the radical feminist theoretical model in their work to acknowledge the root cause of much violence against women, in which women are often targeted due to their gender and men are often perpetrators due to their enforcement of gen- der hierarchies. This model best fits within the hate crime paradigm and addresses the political nature of violence against women. REFERENCES Angelari, M. (1994).

Lorena Delaguna appeared in court Tuesday on charges of attempted assault in the second degree as a hate crime and aggravated harassment in the second degree. If convicted, she could be sentenced to seven years in prison.
An African American woman was out for an afternoon jog August 17 in Woodside, a Queens neighborhood, when Delaguna allegedly threw a glass bottle at her, Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz said in a statement Tuesday.
The bottle shattered near the jogger and splashed liquid on her, Katz's office said. Delaguna also allegedly yelled and cursed at the woman, ""telling her to get out of here and go back to Africa and calling her the N-word,"" the statement said.
Delaguna is accused of following the woman for at least a block while yelling and threatening her, Katz's office said.
The woman was not hurt and continued to jog, the New York Police Department said in a report last week about the incident.
CNN has reached out to Delaguna's attorney for comment.
""Crimes like this, which are fueled by hate, are in a special category for a reason,"" Katz said in the statement. ""No one should have to endure being called a vile slur or being attacked simply because of the color of their skin, their religion, or who they love.""

Results show that, in this jurisdiction, the typology is an inadequate tool for classifying cases prosecuted as hate crimes. Approximately one third of the cases are unclassifiable according to the typology. Findings indicate that the typology is useful for understanding cases in which bias is the sole motivation but inadequate for application to the many cases in which bias is a peripheral motivation. bias crimes hate crimes crime typology prosecution of hate crimes O ver the past few decades, there has been increased public debate con- cerning bias-motivated crimes as well as the development of legislation in virtually every state to combat such crimes (Jenness & Grattet, 2001). in virtually every state to combat such crimes (Jenness & Grattet, 2001). Currently, despite the president's veto threat, a bill is pending in Congress that will add gender, sexual orientation, and gender identity to the federal hate crime legislation (Stout, 2007). Despite the proliferation of legislation designed to combat hate crimes, few empirical studies have addressed the prosecution of hate crimes. In an effort to fill the void, this article contributes to the literature in two ways. First, it examines court data for all cases referred by investigators for prosecution as bias crimes in one New Jersey county between 2001 and 2004. Author's Note: Correspondence concerning this article should be addressed to Nickie D. Phillips, Department of Sociology and Criminal Justice, St. Francis College, 180 Remsen Street, Brooklyn, NY 11201; e-mail: nphillips@stfranciscollege.edu 884 These cases represent 5% of the 643 cases referred to investigators as poten- tial bias crimes. Second, it appears that this is the first empirical study apply- ing Levin and McDevitt's (1993, 2002) hate crime typology to cases occurring outside of Boston. Preliminary findings indicate that the typology is incom- plete because it fails to account for a large number of cases that were prose- cuted as bias crimes in this jurisdiction. In general, bias crimes are defined as crimes “that manifest evidence of prejudice based on race, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity” (Federal Bureau of Investigation [FBI], 2006). According to the most recent Uniform Crime Report's hate crime statistics, 8,380 hate crime offenses had occurred nationwide in 2005. However, scholars agree that bias-motivated crimes are underreported (Berk, Boyd, & Hamner, 1992; Garcia, McDevitt, Gu, & Balboni, 2003; Herek & Berrill, 1992; McDevitt et al., 2000). For example, Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) has estimated as many as 50,000 bias- motivated crimes per year, whereas the findings of National Crime Victimization Survey indicated that only about 44% of the 210,000 hate crime victimizations from July 2000 through December 2003 were reported to police (Harlow, 2005, p. 1: Southern Poverty Law Center, n.d.). Although bias crimes are believed to be underreported, they are a small percentage of the total crimes that occur. Specifically, Harlow (2005) had estimated that bias crimes comprised only “3% of all violent crimes revealed to the NCVS [National Crime Victimization Survey] by victims” (p. 1). Although bias crimes occur relatively infrequently, proponents of bias crime legislation argue that such crimes are qualitatively different from nonbias crimes and are therefore deserving of more severe punishment (Herek & Berrill, 1992; Lawrence, 1999; Levin, 1999). Enforcement of Bias Crime Legislation Prior research found much variability in the way law enforcement per- sonnel have interpreted and enforced laws prohibiting bias crimes. For example, Jenness and Grattet (2005) examined the various factors influenc- ing the extent to which hate crime policies developed at the local level across the state of California. The researchers found that organizational pervi- ousness, as measured by the presence of community group meetings, commu- nity policing practices, and workplace heterogeneity, was the strongest predictor of having a policy (Jenness & Grattet, 2005). Although having a department policy indicated some effort to formally address bias crimes, it did not necessarily translate into actual enforcement. 885 Haider-Markel (2002) surveyed police departments and district attor- neys across the nation about their perception of the enforcement of anti- gay/lesbian–bias crime legislation. According to the survey results, factors such as hate crime training for law enforcement, favorable attitudes toward enforcement of officers and supervisors, belief that enforcement has an impact on the level of hate crime, and the presence of state hate crime leg- islation were found to impact the enforcement of hate crime legislation. The above suggests that the development of hate crime policies and subse- quent implementation varies across jurisdictions. The enforcement of bias crime legislation is contingent on decision making by various actors at numer- ous stages, all influenced by the social context from which they operate. For example, to enforce bias crime legislation, incidents must be reported to law enforcement officers and classified as bias-motivated crimes. Research has indicated that classification and investigation procedures vary by department (Boyd, Berk, & Hamner, 1996; Martin, 1995). Furthermore, researchers examining the enforcement of bias crimes have noted that both investigators and prosecutors tend to look for the “perfect” case when enforcing bias crime legislation (Bell, 2002; Boyd et al., 1996; Levin & McDevitt, 2002). For example, Boyd et al. reported that investigators in one division developed a conception of a “true” or “normal” bias crime (p. 835). The investigators described true bias crimes as sharing the following characteristics: a lack of provocation by the victim, a lack of prior relationship between the offender and victim, and “a specific target, and accompanying derogatory insults” (Boyd et al., 1996, p. 835). The other division defined bias crime more broadly, classifying cases as bias motivated if there was even a “single ele- ment” indicating bias motivation (Boyd et al., 1996, p. 843). Similarly, other researchers have suggested that prosecutors are likely to only charge bias crimes in “perfect” cases or those in which “the evidence of bias is overwhelming” (Bell, 2002; Maroney, 1998, p. 604; see also Levin & McDevitt, p. 183). Maroney suggested that investigators and prosecutors will be quick to weed out “mixed-motive” cases, defined as those in which there is the presence of some motive other than bias. Maroney further suggested that both will reject such cases “even though many hate crime laws and departmen- tal protocols explicitly provide for inclusion of such crimes” (p. 604). Despite the effort by investigators to screen out problematic cases, Martin (1996), in her examination of hate crime incidents in Baltimore County, found that ambiguous cases remained for which investigators had to make a determination and “judgment about First Amendment issues that have vexed constitutional scholars” (p. 317). Thus, crimes in which bias is expressed, but not the primary motivation, present problems for investiga- tors and prosecutors in the enforcement of hate crime legislation. 886 Hate Crime Typology Typologies are developed and used to conceptualize and classify informa- tion in meaningful ways. Specifically, typologies have been developed for var- ious crimes such as rape, terrorism, domestic violence, and homicide (Groth & Birnbaum, 1979; Holmes & Holmes, 1998; Holtzworth-Munroe, Meehan, Herron, Rehman, & Stuart, 2000; Hudson, 1999; McCabe & Wauchope, 2005). One of the earliest efforts to focus on bias crimes included the seminal book by Levin and McDevitt (1993), Hate Crimes: The Rising Tide of Bigotry and Bloodshed. Levin and McDevitt examined the cultural influences on those that harbor bigotry and illustrated how bigotry manifests itself in violence. The book contributed to our understanding of hate crimes, by exploring the motiva- tions and patterns of violence, seemingly propelled by bigotry and prejudice and directed toward those viewed as different or the Other. Specifically, the authors developed a typology based on offender motivation. The typology, designed as an aid toward understanding the motivation of hate crime offenders, has been widely cited by scholars and has appeared in law enforcement training materials (American Prosecutors Research Institute [APRI], 2000; Gerstenfeld, 2004; McDevitt, Levin, & Bennet, 2002; McLaughlin, Malloy, Brilliant, & Lang, 2000; Perry, 2003; Shively, 2005; Wessler, 2000). For example, according to the training curriculum featured in McLaughlin et al.'s “Responding to Hate Crime: A Multidisciplinary Curricu- lum,” the typology has been used to do the following: assist law enforcement in identifying suspects, locate offenders, gain insight into the victim's percep- tion of his or her vulnerability, gain insight into the offender's motivation, determine the probability of escalation, and anticipate community response (p. 48). The curriculum suggest that whereas offenders may fit into more than one category, the typology assists in recognizing typical hate crimes. The typology is also referenced in the American Prosecutors Research Institute's A Local Prosecutor's Guide for Responding to Hate Crime as aiding officers to identify potential offenders. Levin and McDevitt's (1993) original typology consisted of three cate- gories: thrill, reactive (or defensive), and mission crimes. It was later updated to include a fourth category, retaliatory crimes (McDevitt et al., 2002). Thrill crimes were described as criminal behavior “set off by a desire for excitement and power” in McDevitt et al. (p. 306) and to have “some fun” and “to stir up a little excitement . . . at someone else's expense” in Levin and McDevitt (p. 65). Reactive crimes, later renamed defensive, were characterized by those in which the offender feels threatened by outsiders encroaching on their “com- munity, means of livelihood, or way of life” (Levin & McDevitt, p. 76). Such 887 crimes were considered a response to a threat to the offender's resources, such as minorities moving into a homogenous neighborhood. Mission crimes were described as those in which the offender believed the victim was “evil” and needed to be destroyed (Levin & McDevitt, p. 89). This often, but not neces- sarily, involved allegiance to a particular bias-related group or ideology. Retaliatory crimes were said to be sparked by “a desire to avenge a perceived degradation or assault on their group” (McDevitt et al., 2002, p. 306). Retaliatory crimes referred “specifically to incidents in which offenders act in response to a [real or perceived] hate crime” (McDevitt et al., 2002, p. 309). In their updated work, Hate Crimes Revisited: America's War on Those Who Are Different, Levin and McDevitt (2002) devoted a chapter to each cat- egory of the typology, offering numerous examples of crimes that have occurred across the nation. Many of the cases received significant media atten- tion such as Tom and John Metzger's involvement in the murder of Mulugeta Seraw (mission category) as well as the murder of Yusuf Hawkins in Bensonhurst, New York by a group of White young men (defensive category). In 2002, McDevitt et al. (2002) applied the typology to 169 cases reported and investigated as bias motivated by the Boston Police Department. Of the 169 cases, 111 were categorized by the researchers as thrill, 43 as defensive, 14 as retaliatory, and 1 as mission. The typology has been widely cited and used in training curriculum. Beyond the original authors, however, there are no empirical studies in which the typology has been systematically applied to a universe of cases forwarded to prosecutors in a particular jurisdiction. As Gerstenfeld (2004) stated, “its utility and meaning remain to be found” (p. 77; Shively, 2005). As such, the applicability of the typology must continue to be tested by researchers who are able to gain access to prosecutorial information about hate crimes in local jurisdictions. Despite its widespread use, the hate crime typology has some clear limi- tations. The categories are not mutually exclusive and various categories overlap. For example, in three of the four categories, the offender is likely to seek a location where victims congregate or are located. Similarly, in three of the four categories, peer influence is an important characteristic. Only in the retaliatory category is there a tendency that the offender will act alone. Furthermore, the typology omits cases in which bias is a peripheral com- ponent to the crime. For example, Martin (1995) found that although in some cases bias is expressed during the crime, it is not the primary cause of crime. Scholars have pointed out that the conception and definition of hate crime, specifically the determination of motive, is fraught with difficulty (Berk et al., 1992; Green, McFalls, & Smith, 2001; Jacobs, 1992-1993). Jacobs and Potter 888 Table 1 Levin & McDevitt's Hate Crime Typology Source: Levin and McDevitt (1993), and McDevitt, Levin, and Bennett (2002). a. Category added by McDevitt et al. (2002). The authors argued that retaliatory hate crimes tend to have greatest potential for fueling and refueling additional hate offenses. 889 (1998), who warned of the difficulty in investigating and classifying bias crimes, presented the dilemma in one concise statement: “Must the criminal conduct have been totally, primarily, substantially, or just slightly caused by prejudiced motivation?” (p. 21). Furthermore, Jacobs stated that, in effect, “Practically any crime committed by a member of one group against a member of another qualifies for investigation as a hate crime” (Jacobs, 1992- 1993, p. 548). Excluding cases in which bias is a peripheral component reduces the possibility of having an unwieldy typology. However, there is a lack of research documenting what types of cases are actually prosecuted as bias crimes. If many cases that involve bias as a peripheral motivation are in fact prosecuted as bias crimes, the typology may be of limited usefulness in this context. Method Data on hate crime incidents and offenses are collected from local law enforcement agencies and disseminated annually by the FBI. The FBI data are limited to aggregate measures of incidents and arrests, and contain no information on case processing. Unfortunately, there is no annual national database of hate crime prosecutions and convictions. Furthermore, the def- inition of hate crime varies among jurisdictions, and few states provide databases in which hate crime case processing and outcome information are provided. Instead, researchers must approach individual jurisdictions for access to case-processing data in disaggregate form. This study is the first systematic application of the typology to all cases prosecuted as bias crimes in a particular county over a 4-year period. These cases were determined by investigators to meet the criteria of a bias crime and, as a result, were referred to prosecutors. These cases represent 5% of the total cases examined by investigators during the study period. The pur- pose of the study is to provide an empirical test of the usefulness of the typology as it pertains to cases prosecuted as bias crimes. A jurisdiction in New Jersey was chosen because it has been identified as a leader in addressing bias crimes. It was among the first to develop a bias crime unit on the East Coast. The county has a population of more than 250,000, which is relatively affluent, with a median household income greater than the national median. In terms of race/ethnicity, the majority of the popula- tion is categorized as White. Blacks comprise the largest minority popula- tion, with Hispanic or Latino persons comprising less than 10% of the population (U.S. Census Bureau, 2000). The crime rate in the county is 890 slightly lower than the crime rate for the state of New Jersey (New Jersey State Police, 2005). This research involved the analysis of the files pertaining to all cases referred for prosecution as bias crimes between 2001 and 2004. These 30 cases were considered by investigators as the only cases suitable for bias crime prosecution out of a total of 643 cases originally investigated.2 As such, the cases in the current study have met the legal rigors of inclusion according to the New Jersey statute. They were judged by police and pros- ecutors who specialize in bias crimes as exhibiting legal characteristics of a bias crime. Therefore, the cases were by definition the least ambiguous from a legal standpoint and as such should be classifiable according to the hate crime typology. According to investigators, each case referred met the cri- teria as indicated in the New Jersey's Bias Incident Investigative Standards (BIIS; 2000). According to BIIS, a bias incident is defined as any suspected or confirmed offense or unlawful act which occurs to a person, private property, or public property on the basis of race, color, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity. An offense is bias based if the motive for the commission of the offense or unlawful act pertains to race, color, religion, gender, handicap, sexual orientation, or ethnicity (BIIS 2000, p. 9). By way of background, the bias unit in this county consists of two full- time investigators along with two officers that fill in when the designated investigators are unavailable. The unit is responsible for investigating all bias-motivated incidents (criminal and noncriminal), outreach to the com- munity and local schools in the form of workshops or presentations, and bias training for police officers. Potential bias-motivated crimes reach the bias unit through a variety of sources. The Office of Bias Crimes and Community Relations operates a statewide bias hotline in which victims may report bias-related incidents that are then forwarded to the appropriate jurisdiction. Furthermore, following a memorandum of agreement between the Department of Law and Public Safety and the Department of Education (New Jersey Administrative Code [N.J.A.C.], 6:29-10.1), schools in New Jersey are mandated to report all allegations of bias-motivated incidents to law enforcement. Finally, all police agencies in the county are required to forward all reported bias-motivated crimes to the bias unit at the county prosecutor's office. Once identified and confirmed as bias motivated by investigators, a case may be referred for prosecution as a bias crime. The New Jersey Bias Intimidation statute defines a bias crime as an offense committed “with a pur- pose to intimidate an individual or group of individuals because of race, color, religion, gender, handicap, sexual orientation, or ethnicity or knowing that the 891 conduct constituting the offense would cause an individual or group of indi- viduals to be intimidated because of race, color, religion, gender, handicap, sexual orientation, or ethnicity” (New Jersey Statute [NJS], 2C:16-1). The BIIS (2000, p. 15) also contains guidelines for confirming incidents of bias. Investigators are instructed to consider, for example, the totality of the circumstances, note any statements made by the suspect or witnesses, and look for bias symbols, words, graffiti, or other types of evidence. To classify cases, the investigators look for other motives for the incident, that is, whether the offenders are members of a hate group, whether the victim and offender share identities (e.g., racial, religious, or ethnic group identi- ties), and whether the victim recently moved into the area. Information on cases was retrieved from both investigative and prosecutor case files. Investigative case files typically contained a cover sheet that included preliminary information regarding case characteristics, offender(s) and victim(s) characteristics, initial police report, and any subsequent investiga- tive materials such as transcripts of interviews with offender(s), victim(s), and witnesses. The prosecutor's case files typically contained information on the proposed indictment, grand jury decisions, a plea sheet, criminal history reports, sentence received, and copies of the investigative materials. Information coded from case files included the following: type of bias motivation (race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and gender), type of offense, location, number of offenders/ victims, victim injury, age and race of offender/victim, charges, and case disposition. This research entailed analyzing case file information and investigators' narratives, and coding those details according to McDevitt et al.'s (2002) bias crime typology (see also Levin & McDevitt, 1993).3 As previously mentioned, the characteristics of each category are noted in Table 1. In classifying cases into the typology, I followed as closely as possible the characteristics and examples provided in Levin and McDevitt, and McDevitt et al. Case narratives and interview transcripts of offenders, victims, and witnesses were examined to gain information pertaining to the triggering event, goal, peer influence, tar- geted victims, and typical location (see Table 1). The triggering event refers to any event that either precipitated, or acted as a catalyst to the behavior on the part of the offender. The goal refers to the underlying rationale for the behav- ior on the part of the offender (e.g., to rid the world of evil or to protect their neighborhood from outsiders). Peer influence, targeted victims, and location were noted for each case. However, the typology contains overlapping cate- gories, making difficult the task of straightforward classification of cases into distinct categories. For example, both reactive/defensive and retaliatory hate 892 crimes may involve a precipitating or triggering event. Similarly, peer influ- ence is characteristic of thrill, mission, and reactive/defensive categories. Cases in which there was no clear indication of the goal on the part of the offender were coded as unclassifiable. Results Of the total 643 cases presented to the bias unit between 2001 and 2004, 30 (less than 5%) were referred by the bias unit for prosecution as bias crimes. Although the data from the current study were limited to one juris- diction, this study includes the entire population of cases referred for prosecution as bias crimes between 2001 and 2004 (N = 30). Descriptive information for these cases is displayed in Table 2.4 Racial and religiously motivated crimes comprised 63% of the total cases. The number of offend- ers per case ranged from 1 to 4, with an average of 1.87 offenders. Nearly half of the cases involved a single offender, slightly under one fourth of the cases involved two offenders, and only two cases involved four offenders (see Table 2).55 Previous research has indicated that bias crimes are typically relatively low-level offenses (Garofalo & Martin, 1993). The cases presented for prose- cution in the current study were no exception. The prosecutor's office was unable to retrieve five files, therefore, case outcome information was restricted to cases in which files were available. Of these 25 cases, 23 involved at least one offender charged with a bias crime and the remaining 2 resulted in crimi- nal charges but not bias charges. Although the average number of offenders per case charged with a criminal offense was 2.0, the average number of offenders charged with a bias offense was 1.87. The average number of offenders convicted per case for a bias offense was 0.96 (see Table 3). Due to the small numbers of cases referred for prosecution as bias crimes during the 4-year period, it was not possible to conduct sophisti- cated statistical analyses to determine the impact of independent variables on conviction rates. However, identifiable patterns did emerge from the analysis. Of the cases resulting in a bias charge, religiously motivated and multibias cases were more likely to result in conviction than racially moti- vated cases (see Table 4). Nearly half of the cases that resulted in bias crime charges were catego- rized as juvenile cases (11 out of 23 cases). Juveniles were more likely than adults to be involved in property crimes than personal crimes. Furthermore, cases involving juveniles were more likely to result in conviction for a bias 893 Table 2 Case Characteristics a. Multibias cases refer to cases involving any combination of racial, religious, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or gender bias occurring within one incident. b. Cases were classified as juvenile or adult based on whether the offender was juvenile or adult (18 years or older) at the time of the crime. In cases with more than one offender, cases were coded according to the age of the majority of offenders. In cases in which there was a combination of juvenile and adult offenders, the age gap was generally not greater than 1 year. 894 Table 3 Charges and Convictions per Case Table 4 Bias Crime Typology a. The prosecutor's office was unable to locate files for five cases, therefore, case outcome information was not available for those cases. crime than adult cases. Correspondingly, cases involving property crimes were more likely to result in at least one offender conviction for a bias crime. One possible reason why cases involving juveniles were more likely to result in a bias conviction may relate to the extent to which the grand jury was reluctant to return an indictment on a bias charge for adult offenders. 895 It is also possible that juveniles committed crimes in which bias was likely to be perceived as the sole motivation for the crime and therefore more likely to result in conviction. Case Typology The hate crime typology was applied to the 30 cases referred for prose- cution by the bias unit. Two independent raters coded the cases, with 73% agreement. According to Rubin and Babbie (2004), a 70% agreement rate is considered acceptable. Of the 30 cases referred for prosecution by the bias unit, 13 were coded as motivated by thrill, 4 as mission, 1 as defensive, and 1 as retaliation (see Table 4). The remaining cases were simply unclassifiable. Many cases did not fit any of the four predesignated categories of the typology. Many cases eluded the thrill category because there was no apparent evidence that the offender set out to get kicks or to “stir up a little excitement” (Levin & McDevitt, 2002, p. 67). Rather, the bias appeared to emerge due to an interpersonal confrontation with the victim. Furthermore, although the behaviors often appeared retaliatory in scope because they occurred in the context of ongoing interpersonal con- frontations, they were distinguishable from McDevitt et al.'s (2002) concept of “retaliation,” which refers “specifically to incidents in which offenders act in response to a hate crime” (p. 309). In other words, bias was a peripheral com- ponent, emerging during the context of an already existing interpersonal confrontation. Of the cases in which outcomes were known, eight thrill cases and two mission cases resulted in a bias conviction. However, not surprisingly, of the cases that were unclassifiable—and arguably falling outside the concep- tion of the typical hate crime—only one resulted in a bias conviction (see Table 4). Thrill Of the 30 cases 13 (43%) were categorized as motivated by thrill. The cases appeared to have no clear precipitating event, and the vast majority of thrill cases involved more than one offender. Such cases usually involved juveniles (77%) and frequently involved property crimes (69%). Of 13 cases, 7 (54%) were motivated by bias against religion, with the majority evidencing anti-Jewish bias. In eight of the thrill cases at least one offender was convicted of a bias offense. 896 An example of a thrill case involved three juvenile offenders who spray painted swastikas and other graffiti (e.g., “f . . .”) on vehicles parked in the vic- tim's driveway. The victims were Jews and had decorated their house with Hanukkah decorations for the holiday. According to the investigation report, the victims expressed concern that they “were being targeted for some type of violence.” Case files revealed that the juveniles “just thought it would be funny” to paint swastikas. One juvenile erased his own graffiti and stated that he participated because he thought it would be “harmless fun.” Another thrill case involved three juvenile males and one adult male offender driving around throwing rocks and yelling out racial epithets at passersby. The racially offensive remarks included “n . . . ,” “spic,” “spic, I'm going to f . . . your mother,” and “go back to your own country.” According to the case files, the offenders denied racial prejudice. However, when asked to describe their behavior, they stated that they were playing “screamers” which they described as a game in which they drive “around to random people and scream gibberish at them or whatever is in our heads to scream or whatever is on the radio to get a reaction.” When asked why this particular location was chosen for “screamers,” one juvenile stated because the area “has everybody, Chinese, Black, Spanish, Native American, everybody.” However, when asked if he was a racist, the juvenile replied, “hell no.” According to the offenders, all minorities are not equally susceptible to being victimized and the offend- ers explained that the game does have rules; the victims off-limits for “scream- ers” are little children and the elderly. Retaliation Retaliatory cases are those in which the offender is responding to a real or perceived attack against members of their own group. The single retalia- tory case was in response to the 9/11 attacks in the United States and was directed toward an Islamic center. The center received a series of harassing and threatening answering-machine messages. The offender was charged with bias harassment. The offender admitted to making the call and stated that he was “angry beyond words” and that he “spewed some venom that I'm embarrassed by . . . it was a knee-jerk reaction.” Defensive McDevitt et al. (2002) described defensive cases as those in which the offender is clearly concerned with protecting his community from “those he considered to be outsiders or intruders” (p. 308). The following single case 897 provides an example of a defensive bias crime. The case involved an ongo- ing dispute between two members on a planning board. Both parties filed various complaints against each other. The case involved harassing answering- machine messages left by the offender that indicated the offender would drop the lawsuit if the victim removed herself from the planning board. The message stated, “We don't need Syrians on the planning board,” and “It will be sending a message to your people, and that [this town] is going to be tough on them.” Mission McDevitt et al. (2002) described the mission category as cases in which “the perpetrator seeks to rid the world of evil” (p. 309). Mission hate crimes are frequently committed by members of organized hate groups and may include offenders exhibiting symptoms of mental illness. Only four cases in the current study were categorized as mission. Two related cases categorized as mission involved youths that created their own hate group and had defined their own criteria for membership. The youth engaged in numerous acts of criminal mischief and other prop- erty crimes. Graffiti was sprayed on the nearby bridge and included various swastikas, pentagrams, and the phrase, “God sucks ass.” Furthermore, the youth knocked over a statue of the Mother Mary and removed the head of the statue. The juveniles scrawled graffiti at various locations, including a church and surrounding vehicles, and buildings, fences, and roadways. The graffiti was at times pointedly bias and included drawings of swastikas and pentagrams as well as phrases such as “N . . . s shall die,” “Nazi,” “white power n . . . s beware,” and so on. However, much of the graffiti was unrelated to bias and included phrases such as “big penises rock,” “S . . . sucks pussy,” “This car makes dingy noises,” “f . . . the world,” “God sucks ass,” and “Satan is my lover.” A few mission cases involved offenders exhibiting symptoms of mental illness. One case involved victims traveling on a highway. As the offender's vehicle approached, the offender threw a water bottle at the victim's vehi- cle. At the next light, the offender exited his vehicle and swung the drive shaft from his vehicle, striking the victim's car on the hood. The accused stated that he was working for the FBI and thought that the victims were Arabs and were harassing him. He stated he was an assassin assigned to kill Osama Bin Laden and he had recently hired gods to “take him out.” The case files indicated that the offender was delusional, exhibiting symptoms of mental illness. 898 Unclassifiable The following section describes cases in which bias seemed peripheral to the crime and the offender's actions appeared to be a direct response to the victim's actions immediately preceding the crime. Such cases were sim- ply unclassifiable and did not fit the typology. As a result, these cases cre- ate difficulties for prosecutors. This is problematic because more than one third of the cases referred from the bias unit fall into this category. All of the unclassifiable cases were comprised of adult offenders. Of the 11I unclassifiable cases, 10 consisted of personal crimes. Of the 23 cases in which at least one offender was charged with a bias crime, only one of the seven unclassifiable cases ended in a bias conviction for at least one offender. One case involved a victim and her 2-year-old grandson who pulled into the parking lot of a convenience store. As the victim parked, two offenders in a nearby vehicle stated, “Why didn't you park straight” and added, “Bitch, why can't you park straight, I can't get out, n . . . .” One offender entered the con- venience store to purchase a cup of coffee and returned to the vehicle. The vic- tim stated to the offender, “You need to tell your girlfriend to have more manners,” and the offender responded with racial slurs. The offender then approached the victim and threw coffee at the victim. There was no informa- tion in the case files indicating whether the offenders fall into any of the four categories, that is, thrill seeking, on a mission, defensive, or retaliatory. Rather, the precipitating event emerged as a direct result of the parking dispute. In another case, a Hispanic man arrived at the victim's yard sale intoxi- cated, loud, and boisterous. The accused stated, “I'll kick your mother f . . . ing cracker ass” and proceeded to kick and punch the victim. The accused then stated, “I kicked your ass white boy.” The victim reported that the responding officer refused to arrest the accused. The victim reported that the officer stated that the “fight was between two men” and that the “judge would throw the case out of court anyway.” The officer then gave the accused a ride away from the area. The victim called another officer to the scene. Though the verbal comments directed toward the victim were biased, there was no indication in the files whether the offender's goal was thrill seeking, retaliatory, mission, or defensive in nature. Subsequently, an inter- nal investigation was launched regarding the behavior of the initial responding officer. The case files revealed that the report filed by the initial responding officer made no mention of bias, but did mention the odor of alcohol and an argument about money. The final example of an unclassifiable case brings up an interesting issue concerning the prosecution of bias crimes: The victim of the alleged bias 899 crime was an on-duty police officer.6 The offender was involved in a motor vehicle accident and was subsequently arrested for driving under the influ- ence (DUI). The accused repeatedly threatened the transporting officers during transport. The offender made racial slurs and threatened to find out where the officer lived and to kill the officer's family. According to inves- tigative reports, the offender stated that he was “under the influence” at the time of the threats and that he “made a mistake.” The context of the case— the fact that the offender was in the custody of law enforcement at the time of the crime and made his remarks in response to his arrest—indicate that the offender was acting in response to the action of the officers rather than acting in a manner that can be classified as thrill seeking, mission, retalia- tory, or defensive. Discussion Due to the lack of empirical research on the prosecution of bias-motivated crimes, criminologists know very little about what kind of cases are success- fully prosecuted. This study focused on each of the cases prosecuted as a bias crime between 2001 and 2004 in one New Jersey county. As such, they were presumably cases in which both bias investigators and prosecutors believed were reasonably likely to result in a bias crime conviction. By examining cases that were actually prosecuted as bias crimes, rather than the larger pool of cases that potentially included an element of bias, this study aimed to exclude cases in which the bias element was most ambiguous. Although the cases were screened and identified as hate crimes, the cases did not easily fit the hate crime typology developed by Levin and McDevitt (1993). Generally, the cases designated as defensive, retaliatory, and mission were categorized with relative ease. However, the remaining one third of the cases was unclassifiable. Although the unclassifiable cases included some element of bias, this bias did not seem to be the primary motivation for the crime. The typology was developed to aid law enforcement in “investigating and identifying hate crimes”; arguably, the typology was designed to pro- vide an organized way of recognizing hate crimes (McDevitt, Levin, & Bennett, 2002, p. 305). The typology omits cases in which bias is a periph- eral component to the crime. It is recognized that if the typology were to be expanded to include such cases, it would ultimately water down the concept of a hate crime, rendering it virtually useless. Such an omission is consis- tent with Lawrence's (1999) suggestion that bias crime legislation should 900 target those offenders exhibiting racial animus rather than discriminatory selection, thereby excluding cases in which bias is peripheral to the motive. However, not all legislation is defined so narrowly. Case files revealed that, in this jurisdiction, there is still disagreement about whether bias need only be exhibited or be an integral element of the offense. Because such a large percentage of cases in the current study were unclassifiable, the typology did not appear to be a useful tool for categorizing cases in this jurisdiction. The typology may be most useful for law enforcement in those jurisdictions in which the law is defined rather narrowly. In the current study, cases in which bias seemed to be the primary, if not sole, motivation were most likely to end in a bias conviction. Similar to Martin's (1995) findings, determining the role of bias was sometimes prob- lematic. Even cases that displayed unambiguous, or included overwhelming, signs of bias such as painted swastikas or “KKKs,” frequently also included nonbias-related graffiti as well. For example, in one case, the offenders painted anti-Semitic graffiti along with the phrase, “I hate working here.” In such cases, the presence of nonbias graffiti may increase doubt among prosecutors (and jurors) that bias was the “true” motivation. Future research is needed in other jurisdictions to more fully understand the various types of cases prose- cuted as bias crimes. An additional concern regarding the application of the typology centers on cases categorized as mission, which involved evidence of mental illness, specifically psychotic symptoms, on the part of the offender. In general, the typology (as does the legal system) makes the assumption that offenders act rationally, with the exception of the mission category. Levin and McDevitt (1993, 2002, p. 91) proposed that the mission category includes those who tar- get an entire group of people, whether due to “severe mental illness,” includ- ing hallucinations and other psychotic symptoms, and/or allegiance to a hate group. A few cases in the current study involved offenders exhibiting paranoid delusions and other symptoms of psychosis. Conceptually categorizing the severely mentally ill along with (presumably otherwise rational) hate group members seems problematic. There is a qualitative difference between those who commit crimes as a result of mental illness and those whose crimes manifest as a consequence of their adoption of hateful ideology. As previously mentioned, a number of factors influence the way bias crime legislation is enforced across jurisdictions. The attitudes of law enforcement per- sonnel, training, bureaucratic organization, community context, and public sup- port may impact the extent to which policy is implemented (Haider-Markel, 2002; Jenness, 2007; Jenness & Grattet, 2005). Findings from the current study show that this particular jurisdiction has not only a detailed written 901 policy directed toward bias crimes but also has a dedicated team of full- time investigators assigned to enforcing the legislation. The investigators and prosecutors were enthusiastic, stating that their practices have fre- quently been praised as a desired model of bias crime law enforcement. However, despite the existence of a detailed policy and the effort exerted by law enforcers, ambiguities and difficulties enforcing bias crime legislation remain. Due to the variations in the enforcement of hate crime legislation, find- ings from this jurisdiction may not be generalized to other jurisdictions. Future studies should examine the application of the typology among a variety of jurisdictions, specifically those in which bias is defined as the sole, or the primary, motivation. Conclusion This research begs the question of at what point a typology is useful. Echoing Jacobs and Potter's (1998) concern regarding the very conception of a hate crime, must the typology provide for the vast majority of cases, only half, or only a fourth? A more optimistic take on the results may be that two thirds of the cases did indeed fit the typology. Furthermore, cases that fit the typology were more likely to result in at least one offender with a bias convic- tion than those that did not fit the typology. The findings suggest that the typol- ogy may be helpful only in identifying the most extreme examples of bias-motivated crimes. In this jurisdiction, the legal definition of a bias inci- dent considered suitable for prosecution is defined rather broadly. The net is cast even wider for the number of cases that have elements of bias motivation and undergo investigation. Hypothetically, if the concept of hate crime is widened to include the mere presence or expression of bias (or the typology is widened to more accurately include a substantial number of cases triggered by interpersonal confrontation), then a net-widening effect occurs. As a result, the distinguishing nature of bias crimes virtually vanishes. The net-widening effect also illustrates the concern regarding the unin- tended consequences of hate crime legislation (Franklin, 2002; Maroney, 1998). At its inception, hate crime legislation was focused on addressing vio- lence “connected to racism, nationalism, anti-Semitism, sexism, and hetero- sexism” (Jenness & Grattet, 2001, p. 32). Anti–hate crime advocates not only influenced policy designed to punish bias-motivated offenders as well as send a message to the larger community that bias-motivated crimes would not be tolerated (Jenness & Grattet, 2001). However, scholars were quick to voice 902 concerns about how the legislation would be enforced and who would be pun- ished (Franklin, 2002; Jacobs & Potter, 1998). Findings from the current study show that enforcement of the legislation applies to atypical offenders (e.g., mentally ill exhibiting psychotic symptoms) and atypical victims (e.g., on- duty police officers). Further research is needed to examine the types of cases prosecuted in other jurisdictions. Although much scholarly work has centered on various aspects of hate crimes, there is a paucity of research focused on cases actually prosecuted as hate crimes. Results indicate that the typology has limited usefulness in categorizing cases that are actually prosecuted as hate crimes in this juris- diction. A successful typology proves useful in a variety of empirical con- texts in which it is applied. Therefore, this research suggests at the outset that the everyday cases investigators and prosecutors encounter may be dif- ficult to classify into the widely cited and academically accepted hate crime typology. Rather than bias or hate, many cases appear to be primarily moti- vated by interpersonal confrontation between the parties who then use hate speech as a means of expressing anger or other emotion in an arguably impulsive manner. Future studies should examine the application of the typology among a variety of jurisdictions, specifically those in which bias is legally defined as the sole or primary motivation. Notes 1. The terms bias crime and hate crime will be used interchangeably. 2. Of the 30 cases referred for prosecution, the prosecutor's office was unable to locate files for 5 cases. Therefore, although descriptive information was available for all 30 cases, case outcome information was available for 25 cases. 3. McDevitt, Levin, and Bennett (2002) describe the hate crime typology as an “offender typology” (p. 303). In the current study, the unit of analysis is cases rather than offenders. The reason for this is that although each offender may have a different level of involvement within the same incident, the offenders shared the same bias motivation, and the case as a whole was categorized according to the typology. 4. Of the 25 cases for which case files were available, 23 (76.6%) resulted in at least one offender charged with bias intimidation, and 11 of these 23 cases resulted in at least one bias conviction. 5. Cases were classified as juvenile or adult based on whether the offender was juvenile or adult (18 years or older) at the time of the crime. Cases with more than one offender were coded according to the age of the majority of offenders. In cases in which there was a combination of juvenile and adult offenders, the age gap was generally not greater than 1 year. 6. The issue is, are police officers, while on duty, eligible to be victims of bias? Bias unit investigators repeatedly informed me that police officers cannot be victims of a bias crime while on duty, however, the case was prosecuted as a bias crime. Case notes revealed this exception: “It appears that the accused, though he had been drinking, went beyond the officer's uniform to attack him and his family personally by making threats that could be carried out as the accused knows where the victims live . . . .” 903 References American Prosecutors Research Institute.

The number of anti-Semitic hate crimes increased significantly in 2019, according to the FBI, in a year that saw three lethal attacks against Jews. 
Anti-Semitic incidents &#111nce again comprised the majority of hate crimes based &#111n religion. In addition, the number of total hate crime murders nationwide more than doubled last year. But the Anti-Defamation League cautioned that the FBI""s numbers probably represent just a fraction of total hate crimes committed nationwide. 
The FBI recorded 953 hate crimes against Jews in 2019, a 14% increase from the 835 recorded in 2018, and similar to the 938 recorded in 2017. In 2019, hate crimes against Jews comprised 62% of all hate crimes based &#111n religion, slightly up from 58% in 2018 and 2017. 
Last year saw a series of lethal anti-Semitic attacks that sparked fear and anxiety among American Jews. A synagogue shooting in Poway, California killed &#111ne person exactly six months after the 2018 synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh in which 11 Jews were murdered. 
In December, a shooting in Jersey City, New Jersey that ended at a kosher supermarket killed two Jews and two others. Later that month, a stabbing at a Hanukkah party in Monsey, New York killed &#111ne. The New York-area attacks came amid a spate of anti-Semitic harassment and assaults in Orthodox neighborhoods in Brooklyn. 
""When &#111ne individual is targeted by a hate crime, it hurts the whole community &mdash that""s why people are feeling vulnerable and afraid,"" ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement. 
The string of attacks last year came amid what the ADL has described as a years-long rise in anti-Semitic activity. Just days after 2020 began, 25,000 people marched across the Brooklyn Bridge to protest anti-Semitism in New York City and elsewhere. 
Earlier this year, the ADL found, similarly to the FBI, that anti-Semitic incidents rose by 12% in 2019 (though its methodology differs from the FBI""s). 
The FBI recorded 7,314 total hate crimes last year, a slight increase over 2018 and 2017, and a sharp uptick from the 5,850 recorded in 2015. As in previous years, the majority were based &#111n race. African-Americans experienced the most hate crimes, 1,930.. Hate crimes based &#111n religion made up around 20% of total hate crimes. 
It also saw a huge increase in hate crime murders, from 24 in 2018 to 51 in 2019. That includes the mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, which killed 23 and wounded an additional 23. The shooter wrote in a manifesto that he was acting against a Hispanic ""invasion."" 
The ADL said that the FBI numbers are almost certainly a significant undercount of the true number of hate crimes in the United States. That""s because many municipalities don""t submit hate crime data to the FBI. According to the ADL, 86% of participating agencies reported no hate crimes to the FBI, including 71 cities with populations greater than 100,000. The ADL also said the number of agencies reporting hate crimes to the FBI has declined year over year. 
""We also need to remove the barriers that too often prevent people in marginalized communities – the individuals most likely to suffer hate crimes – from reporting hate-based incidents in the first instance,"" Greenblatt said in a statement. ""In this pivotal moment in our national conversation about the importance of justice for communities of color, religious minorities, and the LGBTQ+ community, we must make combating hate crimes a top priority.""

The New York chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-NY), the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, today condemned anti-Asian coronavirus-related hate crime that occurred last Thursday, Dec. 17, at a subway station in Manhattan.
According to the NYPD, a group of six individuals beat and hurled anti-Asian slurs at a woman in a downtown Manhattan subway station. News reports state that the group spewed anti-Asian slurs, blamed Asians for the coronavirus, and punched the woman in the face multiple times. The woman suffered a bruised and swollen face.

In a statement, CAIR-NY Legal Director Ahmed Mohamed said:
“Anti-Asian hate has no place in our society and must be rejected. It is sickening that almost a year into the COVID-19 pandemic, Asian-Americans are still being targeted in extremely dangerous ways such as this.

Lorena Delaguna, 53, was arraigned in Queens criminal court on charges stemming from the Aug. 17 confrontation with Tiffany Johnson.
“In addition to allegedly yelling the N-word, the defendant in this case is also accused of throwing a bottle in an attempt to strike the victim,"" District Attorney Melinda Katz said in a written statement.
“Crimes like this, which are fueled by hate, are in a special category for a reason,"" the statement read. ""No one should have to endure being called a vile slur or being attacked simply because of the color of their skin, their religion, or who they love.”

Katz did not name the victim, but Johnson, 37, has identified herself as the person being accosted in a video that was recorded by a bystander and released by the Police Department last week.
“It’s a hate crime,” Johnson told the New York Post. “It’s not acceptable.""

In response to an alarming surge in hate crimes in New York and nationwide, the New York State Bar Association (NYSBA) recommends empowering the state Attorney General to dissolve domestic or foreign entities that are proven to provide material or financial support to terrorists and bar any remaining funds from being disbursed to individuals or organizations associated with those entities.
NYSBA also suggests that the offenses that qualify for eavesdropping and video surveillance warrants to be expanded to include hate crimes. State law now allows such warrants to be issued on terrorism and domestic terrorism offenses under the Neumann Act but not under the Hate Crimes Statute. NYSBA further supports mandating counseling and training as part of any sentence imposed on individuals convicted of domestic terrorism and hate crimes.
These recommendations were included in a report of the Task Force on Domestic Terrorism and Hate Crimes approved by the association’s House of Delegates today.
“The recommendations outlined in this substantial and comprehensive report will help rid our state of the scourge of hate crimes,” NYSBA President Scott M. Karson said. “The work done by the members of this task force in a few short months is remarkable, and we will work to make their suggestions a reality.”
The task force, chaired by Carrie H. Cohen, a partner at Morrison & Foerster and former Assistant United State Attorney for the Southern District of New York, examined the factors that led to the surge in hate crimes seen over the past year. The task force included leaders of the bench and bar as well as experts on civil rights and criminal justice.
“Pervasive and insidious racism and race-based intolerance are grave injustices that cannot be tolerated. Hopefully, this report can contribute to ensuring that people of every skin color, ethnicity, religion, and sexual orientation in New York are safe and adequately protected from hate crimes and violence,” Cohen said. “Concrete action is needed now more than ever given the recent hate-based rhetoric related to COVID-19 and the demand for systemic change to combat racial injustice.”
The report also recommends further study of the Neumann Act, passed by the state Legislature and signed into law by Governor Andrew Cuomo this past April. Rabbi Josef Neumann was severely injured and four others were wounded in a knife attack during a Hanukkah celebration in Monsey on Dec. 28, 2019. Neumann remained in a coma until his death on March 29.
The report recommends further study of the following areas:
Possible amendment of New York’s definition of material support to bring it in conformance with federal law, thereby enhancing the state’s ability to prosecute terrorism. Reviewing New York’s civil rights and human rights laws for possible civil causes of action for hate crimes and domestic terrorism, including a cause of action for discrimination or hate-based violence.
The report also recommends:
Amending New York’s not-for-profit, business corporation and limited liability laws to allow the New York State Attorney General to dissolve domestic or foreign entities that are used to provide material or financial support to terrorists or terrorist organizations and prevent recovery of property from entities that support terrorism. Allocating state resources to train prosecutors and law enforcement officers on how to best investigate and prosecute hate crimes. Updating the New York State Attorney General’s hate crimes manuals as an aid to prosecutors across the state. Increasing attention to COVID-based hate crimes."

To the Editor:
Re “Hate Crimes at Highest Since 2008, F.B.I. Reports” (news article, Nov. 17):
For nearly three decades, the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s reporting on hate crimes statistics has consistently provided the most comprehensive snapshot available of bias-motivated criminal activity in the United States. Still, it remains clear that the agency’s yearly statistics understate the true number of hate crimes committed in our country.
Underreporting is attributable to numerous factors, including a lack of political leadership, inadequate training and a failure by some agencies to prioritize tracking and to comprehensively identify and record hate crimes.
It is hard to fix a problem without quantifiable data. At a time of rising hate in the United States, Congress must act swiftly on the Khalid Jabara and Heather Heyer National Opposition to Hate, Assault and Threats to Equality Actof 2019 (“No Hate” Act), a bill named for two recent victims of hate crimes.
The legislation would significantly enhance the accuracy of the F.B.I. statistics by authorizing new funding and support for state and local governments to encourage more robust reporting. With the best data in hand we can work to identify and counter the sources of hate crimes and provide better assistance to victims.

Plea to the Media: Ignore Trump After Jan. 20
To the Editor:
Now that the presidential election is a victory for the Democrats, my thoughts shift to how the press will handle Donald Trump, ex-president. As an exhausted citizen, I implore you not to give any oxygen to the headline-baiting roars of a wounded, irrelevant politician. There will be no polite retreat from Mr. Trump, no chance for Joe Biden to begin his presidency in peace, should the media continue to chase Mr. Trump’s every dishonest, outrageous utterance.
I hold the press somewhat accountable for its wall-to-wall coverage of this bright, shiny charlatan five years ago. Now that his presidency seems to be finished, please leave him alone after Jan. 20. This is his very worst fear.

The number of anti-Semitic hate-crime incidents rose 14 percent in 2019, data from the bureau's annual hate-crime statistical report[1] show, with police departments reporting 953 events and 1,032 victims. 
That is 82 more incidents than in 2018, continuing a rising trend over the past half decade. Jews were in fact a leading target of hate crimes overall, regardless of motivation. In absolute terms, only more black Americans were victimized; on a per capita basis, only gay men and trans people were more likely to be targeted, a Washington Free Beacon analysis found. The shocking increase in reported bias incidents sums up a year in which a high-profile synagogue shooting and a spate of anti-Semitic violence in New York City took place. The latest figures suggest that anti-Jewish bias is not an isolated phenomenon but a widespread and growing threat to Americans' safety. Jewish leaders decried the uptick, calling for greater vigilance against anti-Semitism. 'Once again, the FBI hate crime statistics confirm what the Jewish community knows all too well: that violent antisemitism is a daily reality,' Joel Rubin, the executive director of the American Jewish Congress, told the Free Beacon. 'At the American Jewish Congress we have repeatedly called out rhetoric from both the left and the right that contributes to normalizing hate. Public officials have a special obligation to ensure that their statements and positions inhibit rather than inflame radicals.' 'Anti-Jewish hate crimes have been the most prevalent type of anti-religious hate-based crimes going as far back (1996) as the FBI has public figures on hate crimes,' Republican Jewish Coalition communications director Neil Strauss told the Free Beacon. 'Antisemitism isn't a political issue and doesn't emanate from one side of the political divide in particular. That is why the RJC has been at the forefront in calling out antisemitism on the left and the right. Jewish people, like all Americans, deserve to live without fear. We stand committed to making that possible.'The number of Jewish hate crime victims is particularly shocking in the context of Jews' small share of the population—less than 2 percent, according to the Pew Research Center. Out of every 100,000 Jews, 16 were victims last year, outpacing all but gay men (1.1 percent[2] of the population) and trans people (0.3 percent).

The New York chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-NY), a chapter of the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, today condemned a hate-crime victimizing a Hispanic woman on New York’s Interstate 84. The incident occurred at 5:30 a.m in Brewster, near exit 65. The victim thankfully sustained no injuries.
While sleeping in her car on the westbound shoulder of I-84, the woman was approached by two white males in a Chevrolet pickup truck. The suspects began screaming racial slurs, prompting the victim to attempt an escape. Upon driving away, the men struck her car with their two-tone, black and silver Chevrolet truck.

The first suspect was described as a Caucasian male, possibly in his mid-40’s, husky build, copper colored beard, blonde hair, thick brimmed dark color glasses, a green button-up shirt and baggy blue jeans.
The second suspect was described as a Caucasian male, possibly in his mid-20’s, skinny build, wearing a green tank top, and with a tattoo of the letters “Ang” located on his left wrist.
In a statement, CAIR-NY Executive Director Afaf Nasher called on Brewster residents to call with suspect-identifying information:
“CAIR-NY condemns the dangerous, aggressive and racially-motivated attack on this innocent woman resting in her car. While we are deeply thankful the victim sustained no injuries, the suspects must be identified and held accountable. To this end, CAIR-NY is calling on Brewster residents who may have any information about the identity of the two men to contact local law enforcement. We hope the aggressors are caught and brought to justice swiftly before any more harm is perpetrated.”
CAIR-NY is committed to representing and defending the integrity of the victims of heinous acts and hate-crimes.

The FBI data shows there were 51 murders last year that were reported as hate crimes, up 113% percent from the 24 in 2018 and the most since the bureau started compiling such data after Congress passed the Hate Crimes Statistics Act in 1990.
Last year was also the fourth consecutive increase in hate crime murders, according to the FBI data.
In total, there were 7,314 reported hate crime incidents in 2019, an increase of some 200 such incidents from 2018. Last year also represented the fifth increase in six years.
A hate crime is defined as a criminal offense that is motivated by the offender's bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender or gender identity. Some crimes are motivated by more than one bias, the FBI said.
""When one individual is targeted by a hate crime, it hurts the whole community -- that's why people are feeling vulnerable and afraid,"" Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement on the statistics' release.
Among the 8,552 victims of hate crimes last year, the majority at 57.6% were targeted because of race, ethnicity or ancestry followed by 20.1% because of religion, 16.7% because of sexual orientation, 2.7% because of gender identity, 2% because of disability and 0.9% because of gender.
Hate crimes targeting Jewish and Hispanic people rose 14% and 9%, respectively, with hate crimes targeting people based on their gender identity rising 18% last year after surging 41% a year earlier.
The Southern Poverty Law Center, a non-profit civil rights legal advocacy organization, said in a statement that the increases in hate crimes reflect ""a growing threat of violence from the extreme right.""
Of the 51 hate crime murders committed last year, some two dozen were attributed to attacks that were planned to incite further violence, such as the El Paso Walmart shooting that killed 23 people, the center said.
""These racist ideas are not a political anomaly but rather the most extreme outgrowth of a White supremacist political culture,"" the center said. ""That racism, anti-Hispanic sentiment, antisemitism and homophobia remain pressing problems in the U.S. is reflected in the 2019 hate crime increases.""
The data also shows surging hate crime incidents despite the 15,588 law enforcement agencies that voluntarily submitted their data represent a significant drop from the 16,039 agencies that participated in 2018 and the 16,149 in 2017.
The New York-based ADL, a Jewish non-profit organization that fights all forms of hate, described the FBI's annual report as providing ""the most comprehensive snapshot"" of bias-motivated crimes but the lack of agencies reporting under tabulates the true number of such crimes being committed.
""The total severity of the impact and damage caused by hate crimes cannot be fully measured without complete participation in the FBI's data collection process,"" Greenblatt said, calling on Congress and law enforcement agencies to improve data collection and reporting of hate crimes.
Greenblatt said 2019's increase may be the product of improved reporting but that local law enforcement agencies across the country still need to improve training in order to remove barriers that prevent victims of hate crimes from coming forward.
""In this pivotal moment in our national conversation about the importance of justice for communities of color, religious minorities and the LGBTQ+ community, we must make combating hate crimes a top priority,"" he said.
The Southern Poverty Law Center mirrored this call, urging the Biden administration to mandate the federal collection of hate crime data and move funding to the Department of Education aimed at preventing extremism and to build a curriculum on structural racism."

Of that number 1,311 were anti-Semitic. Jews make up less than 1% of the population. 
Therefore anti-Semitic incidents accounted for 22% of hate crimes recorded last year in the region.The statistic is startling. Stop and think and you will realize the hatred of Jews is around 25 times higher than other groups in the population there. Can you explain this? Does it seem desirable or reasonable? The data on hate crimes comes from a report done by the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR). ODIHR in turn is part of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). ODIHR made the report in its annual report published last week. The report is based on data transmitted by governments and watchdog groups. Of the total incidents, 1,311 were anti-Semitic. The report has the title '2019 Hate Crime Data.' Anti-Semitism was the category with the second-largest number of incidents. There were 2,371 incidents in the more general Racism and Xenophobia category. Those targeted for their gender or sexual orientation (1,277 cases) made up the third-highest group, followed by Christians (573) and Muslims (507). In one anti-Semitic incident recorded in the report, a woman had her hair and hat pulled violently from behind while speaking Hebrew on the bus in Berlin, Germany. In another, an Iraqi Muslim man wearing a kippah and carrying several concealed knives was intercepted by guards attempting to enter an Antwerp synagogue in June. The man had used anti-Semitic insults at Jews before the incident. The report said its figures are not definitive. They may be lower than the number of hate crimes committed or recorded in Europe. America is trending in a very intolerant direction. In America too we are seeing a rising tide of bias incidents. This is an important barometer of America's cultural change. When we see rising numbers of incidents in our metropolitan areas it is telling us something. And we are seeing this. This week we had an anti-religious case decided at the Supreme Court. The State of New York was found to be discriminating against Catholics and Jews. New York's covid restrictions are being used in targeting these religious groups. This is an act of overt discrimination. Intolerance is a real thing. It is evil and pernicious. We must as a nation hold ourselves individually to a higher standard. Freedom requires tolerance. We need to find, to cultivate, tolerance in our pursuit of freedom. This should become part of our personal values, not a political talking point.

HRC responded to troubling federal data showing unacceptably high levels of hate crimes — and an increase in those targeting LGBTQ people — as disclosed by the FBI today.
Today’s report shows that hate crimes based on sexual orientation represent 16.8% of hate crimes, the third largest category after race and religion. The report also shows an uptick in gender identity based hate crimes rising from 2.2% in 2018 to 2.7% in 2019.
“Yet another year with alarming levels of bias-motivated crimes underscores just how urgent it is to address this hate crimes epidemic. This year, we saw a tragic new record of fatal violence against transgender and gender non-conforming people in this country, particularly against Black and Brown transgender women. These alarming statistics represent real trauma for individuals and families across this country who have to bear the brunt of these hate crimes. As the Biden-Harris administration assumes office, we must recommit ourselves to advocating for mandatory hate crimes reporting across the country, better training for law enforcement officers to recognize bias-motivated crimes, and greater inclusion and equity in our communities. ”
Alphonso David, Human Rights Campaign President
Because reporting hate crimes to the FBI is not mandatory, these alarming statistics likely represent only a fraction of such violence. The number of law enforcement agencies reporting hate crimes data decreased by 451 from 2018 to 2019. 71 cities with populations exceeding 100,000 either did not report data to the FBI or affirmatively reported zero hate crimes which is clearly not credible. The lack of mandatory reporting means that the FBI data, while helpful, paints an incomplete picture of hate crimes against the LGBTQ and other communities.
That is why since the passage of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act (HCPA) in 2009, HRC has worked with the FBI to update the agency’s crime reporting, from providing training materials to sharing details on hate crimes when they occur. HRC continues to press for improved reporting, passage of state laws that protect LGBTQ individuals from hate crimes and expanded education and training initiatives.
It’s not only LGBTQ people who are affected by this epidemic of violence. Bias-motivated crimes based on race, religion, disability and gender remain at troublingly high levels. Racially-motivated crime remains the most common hate crime, with nearly half of race-based hate crimes targeting Black people. For the fourth year in a row, there was a significant uptick in hate crimes targeting the Latinx community, increasing 9% from last year. Crimes involving religion-based bias increased with crimes targeting Jewish people and Jewish institutions rising 14% and anti-Muslim hate crimes rising 16%."

They warned that in times of stress like the coronavirus pandemic, when the economy, health and the social structure itself have all taken a beating, some individuals may want to make those beatings more personal by targeting Chinese Americans in a hate crime.
Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva told attendees that the pandemic has brought new challenges to law enforcement and unfortunately, ignorant members of the community may want to lay blame on the Asian American community.
""This (virus) is something we haven't experienced in our lifetime -- something new we have to adapt to. But there is no place for hate or racial discrimination,"" Villanueva said.
Los Angeles, like New York, has one of the most diverse populations in the United States, where people of every culture, nationality, race and religion live side by side -- sometimes harmoniously, sometimes not, law enforcement officers said.
At the federal level, hate crime laws include crimes committed on the basis of the victim's perceived or actual race, colour, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or disability.
An Ipsos poll in April finds that over 30 percent of Americans have witnessed COVID-19 bias against Asians. The STOP AAPI HATE reporting Centre, tasked to track coronavirus discrimination-related cases, has received 1,710 incident reports from Asian Americans across the country since mid-March.
The rising racist sentiments against Asian Americans are believed to be fuelled by some U.S. politicians' misleading comments on the pandemic.
During the COVID-19 outbreak, the Los Angeles Country Sheriff has increased uniform patrols of Asian churches and communities to ensure their safety in an effort to avoid any deplorable attacks like the one against an Asian-American woman that took place in Brooklyn, New York in April.
""Hate crimes can tear at the very fabric of our community, so we will diligently track all hate crimes and hate incidents and their investigations will receive the highest priority,"" Villanueva said.
Lieutenant Andrew Meyer of the Major Crimes Bureau said that since the COVID-19 outbreak, the Sheriff's Department has been closely monitoring the situation to keep an eye out for hate crimes and hate incidents.
""Everyone in our community has the right to be supported and protected against hate crimes and incidents. Victims should know that they have the full support of law enforcement and victim resources,"" Meyer said.
Once a victim has taken the first step in reporting the incident, he assured attendees, law enforcement would do everything in its power to take these crimes seriously and respond to the victims with compassion and understanding.
Meyer said that so far this year, there have been 15 hate crimes, including one anti-Asian, and 21 incidents, also one anti-Asian. He reported that both the anti-Asian hate crime and the incident were COVID-related.
African Americans come in for the most hate crimes and incidents against them, suffering 45 percent of all Los Angeles hate crimes and 29 percent hate incidents in 2019; Hispanics are second, with 12 percent of crimes and 19 percent of incidents; Asians/Pacific Islanders came in with the least amount, 0.02 percent of crimes and 0.01 percent of incidents.
However, the officers cautioned that the COVID-19 outbreak could cause an escalation in hate incidents and crimes against the Chinese or Asian communities and urged community members to be vigilant and swiftly report any problems that arise."

Giselle DeJesus, 35, was being held on $10,000 bond after her arraignment Friday, court records show. A message seeking comment was left for her lawyer.
Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz called the episode a “malicious assault” that left the husband with extensive facial fractures that needed surgery.
“A family was terrorized because of their religious beliefs,” the Democrat said.
According to prosecutors, DeJesus and the couple live on the same street in the Rego Park neighborhood, and DeJesus harassed the wife and the couple's two children in an encounter Sept. 27.
Then, prosecutors say, DeJesus and and a man accosted the couple and the children Nov. 6. in a parking lot behind the apartment building where the family lives.
DeJesus took hold of the wife's hijab while hollering “Muslim” and an obscenity at her, prosecutors said. They said that when the husband intervened and asked for his family to be left alone, the man — who's still at large — pushed him to the ground, kicked him in the head and face and threatened to kill his family. DeJesus kicked him in the stomach and yelled obscenities, according to prosecutors.
The New York Chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations said Friday the husband has been released from the hospital, but the family is afraid to go home.

But this year, stay-home orders and isolation had tamped down the usual stack of new hate-crimes reports to review.
That all changed about a month ago. And he isn't the least bit surprised.
In recent decades, hate crimes have spiked nationally around presidential elections, particularly in the days and weeks immediately before and after Election Day, according to FBI data. The global pandemic does not appear to be stifling the phenomena as we near Nov. 3.
""The last five weeks or so, all the sudden we've seen a remarkable increase,"" said Deputy District Attorney Leonard Trinh, who handles the bulk of hate-crime prosecutions in San Diego County. ""We've had six cases submitted in the last three weeks.""
The trend has been documented to some extent during every presidential cycle since the 1990s, when the FBI began keeping data on hate crimes, said professor Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. However, the trend has unfolded differently in various regions.
At a basic level, it doesn't seem to matter who the candidates are, or who ultimately wins.
The last two presidential transitions of power offer stark examples.
Hate crimes, particularly against Black people, rose in May in 2008, as Barack Obama was poised to take the Democratic nomination in a tight race, said Levin. Hate crime rose again in October, just before the election, as well as after.
2016 numbers
When Trump was elected in November 2016, the nation recorded the worst month for hate crimes in more than a decade, with 758 incidents reported.
""Most, but not all, agencies that broke down data by month or quarter showed dramatic increases around election time in November 2016,"" according to a report by the Center. Regions considered to be Democratic majorities were among the hardest-hit, according to the report, including New York City, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Boston, Washington, D.C., San Jose, Seattle and Phoenix.
""In New York City, the two-week period around the election saw a five-fold increase over the same period the year before,"" the Center reported.
In the city of San Diego that year, the number of reported hate crimes doubled from the third to fourth quarter, from six to 12, according to FBI data.
The day after the 2016 election also stands out, with the most hate-crime events reported nationally in more than a decade.
In San Diego, a hate crime was reported that day by a Muslim student at San Diego State University who was robbed in a parking structure. The two men made comments about President-elect Trump and the Muslim community to the woman, who was wearing a hijab, police said.
""We haven't had a worse day since,"" Levin said, in terms of cases reported.
Specific criteria
To be prosecuted as a hate crime, there must be a criminal act as well as a motivator of hate that fits the strict requirements under California law.
Hate crime is defined in California as criminal acts against an individual or a group of people because of their perceived race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, sexual orientation, gender or disability. Targeting someone solely for their political beliefs is not covered under the law.
The motivation of hate must be more than a remote or trivial factor in the crime. That nexus is often supported by comments during the commission of the crime or previous documented aggressions or statements.
Why the rise now?
The cyclical rise in hate crimes is attributed in part to a spillover effect of the increase in political rhetoric and divisiveness around election cycles, Trinh said.
""When people are getting used to vocalizing their opinions on national politics, it makes it easier to voice opinions about foreigners, people of different religions or sexual orientation,"" Trinh said. ""There's something about that season that makes people think it's more acceptable to express opinions that aren't as popular, mainstream or politically correct.""
Much of that bias festers on social media, where hate speech is easily normalized. ""The more you see it, the more acceptable it becomes to repeat it,"" he said.
Forums for people who share similar grievances have exploded online in response to the pandemic and heightened political and social strife, Levin noted. While many forums are not explicitly extremist or racist, they can act as reservoirs that nurture certain biases, hatred and conspiracies. ""That can lead them down different rabbit holes,"" Levin said.
""What I'm concerned about are the loners who are radicalized rather quickly in an online ecosystem,"" he said. ""People are experiencing health, psychiatric and economic stress, they are online more at home, and more and more people are angrier.""
What that means for this election cycle - in a year marked by unpredictability - is harder to forecast. But the fresh rise in reported cases, and heightened anxiety over the possibility of disputed election results, increases the expectation that history will repeat itself.
Authorities on lookout
Over the past several weeks, the Anti-Defamation League in San Diego - which tracks hate incidents and extremist activity, particularly against the Jewish community - has been training law enforcement around the county what to watch out for around the election.
""We don't think there is any cause for panic, but definitely there is a cause for concern,"" said Tammy Gillies, ADL's regional director. She said lately ADL has received more reports of hate incidents, some of which don't necessarily rise to the level of a crime, such as hate speech.
Latest incidents
The recent uptick of hate-crimes cases in San Diego County have run the gamut but are mostly race-based, which is typical around election time, Trinh said.
There have been no arrests yet related to graffiti vandalism at two East County Catholic churches that occurred on Sept. 26. The graffiti was a confusing mix of ideologies - swastikas and White power alongside Black Lives Matter and the name of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.
On Oct. 10, Rabbi Yonatan Halevy was walking down the sidewalk with his father near his University City synagogue and was punched in the head by a 14-year-old riding his bike, authorities said. The teen spewed anti-Semitic slurs, said something about White power and rode off laughing, the rabbi told the Union-Tribune.
Weeks of harassment by the teen and other youth against the rabbi and congregation had preceded the violent encounter, the rabbi said. The teen was arrested on battery and hate-crime charges.
A few days later in a La Jolla park, a man confronted a Latina nanny caring for a 1-year-old baby. He tossed racial slurs her way before trying to kidnap the child, authorities said. A witness intervened, and the man fled into the ocean but was later arrested on charges that included committing a hate crime.
Of the 42 potential hate-crimes cases submitted so far this year by local law enforcement for possible prosecution, 17 people have been charged by the District Attorney's Office with hate crimes.
Federal cases
There are also federal hate-crime statutes, although they tend to be more narrowly defined. And in some cases, domestic terrorism laws can apply.
""We are prepared if there is an increase in reported hate crimes in the days following the election,"" U.S. Attorney Robert Brewer said.
""Past studies show that some people, motivated by anger or frustration, may act out against people they perceive as different or responsible for election results, and those actions may constitute hate crimes.""
However, crimes involving political bias alone are not covered under California or federal hate-crime laws.
Political bias appears to be the motivation for an altercation at an Encinitas street corner in mid-October, when a man approached a Trump supporter selling campaign merchandise. The man tore down the seller's tent canopy and ran off.
The case remains under investigation, sheriff's officials said. An arrest could include charges such as vandalism, but it would not be treated as a hate crime if the motivation was purely political.
Victims' silence
Understanding the scope of hate crimes both locally and nationally remains difficult, experts say, as many victims don't come forward.
In addition, law enforcement agencies are not required to report hate crimes to the FBI for data analysis. Authorities say there is also indication that many agencies around the country aren't recognizing hate crimes as such.
In 2018, of the more than 16,000 law enforcement agencies that filed data with the FBI, only 12 percent reported hate crimes occurring in their jurisdictions.
Similarly in California that same year, nearly 300 cities of various sizes reported to the state Department of Justice they had no hate crimes.
Speaking up
In San Diego, authorities have teamed up with community leaders in pushing for more public education around hate crimes and urging victims to report - even when it's unclear if a crime has been committed.
Hate incidents can quickly escalate against other targets, Trinh said. Documenting such behavior may also prove useful in future prosecutions.
For instance, prosecutors in San Diego were able to build a hate-crime case against a medical student who had beaten a Lyft driver and vandalized his car by showing a 10-year history of police contact in which the man had made derogatory comments against various ethnic and religious groups.
Victims and witnesses are urged to report immediate incidents by calling 911 and to report less urgent matters to local law enforcement non-emergency lines.
Reports can also be made to the FBI at (858) 320-1800 or to the District Attorney's Office at (619) 515-8805 or hatecrimes@sdcda.org

Since March 21, there have been 21 reported anti-Asian hate crimes that have resulted in 17 arrests, according to Harrison, which he said is higher than normal.
Victims have been reluctant to speak with police during investigations, he said, because of language barriers, cultural differences and fear of the police. In May, Deputy Inspector Stewart Loo proposed the creation of an anti-Asian hate crime task force, hoping that through a dedicated team they could build a better rapport with the community.
The team includes 25 Asian American officers that speak a second language, Loo said. Not having to use translators will increase investigators' ability to develop relationships with victims and ultimately lead to more cooperation, he continued. Harrison noted that 4 of the 17 arrests were done with the help of the task force.
""This task force has been built and will continue to build trust and understanding between the NYPD and with Asian New Yorkers,"" said Harrison.
The task force will be permanent, Harrison said, and other culture-based task forces may be considered in the future.
When asked about why there wasn't a dedicated task force for anti-Semitic crimes, Harrison said that this task force was put together because of Asian Americans' lack of reporting and cooperation with the police. Victims of anti-Semitic crimes work with the police in most cases, he said.
""Since January, before COVID-19 became a national crisis, Asian Americans in New York City have been targeted in unprovoked racist attacks. They have been berated while riding the subway and harassed walking down the street,"" said Thomas Yu, co-executive director of Asian Americans for Equality, in a statement CNN. ""We applaud the city's decision to create an Asian Hate Crimes Task Force, a move that is long overdue... At the same time, far more needs to be done. There is a critical need for resources at every level of government to fight hate crimes wherever they occur.""
JoAnn Yoo, executive director of the Asian American Federation, also welcomed the announcement in a statement to CNN, adding, ""we also believe in restorative justice principles that intervene before hate crimes happen, which include building community within neighborhoods, getting neighbors to look out for each other, and investing in social safety net programs that deal with the stresses in the community that propel people to lash out at each other."""

Two white people in California were charged on Tuesday with a hate crime and other offenses after video appeared to show them vandalizing a Black Lives Matter mural on July 4, officials said.
The two were identified by the Contra Costa District Attorney’s Office as Nicole Claudia Anderson, 42, and David Richard Nelson, 53, both of Martinez, Calif.
Diana Becton, the district attorney, said, “The mural completed last weekend was a peaceful and powerful way to communicate the importance of Black lives in Contra Costa County and the country.”
The mural was painted on July 4 in front of a courthouse in Martinez, a site that the city selected when it issued a permit to the mural’s organizer. Within an hour of its completion, it was vandalized, said the organizer, Justin Gomez.
Video of the episode showed a woman using black paint and a roller brush to cover the letters “B” and “L.” She was joined by a man in a red cap and a red shirt that reads “Trump” and “Four More Years,” who can be heard saying: “We’re sick of this narrative” and “the narrative of police brutality, the narrative of oppression, the narrative of racism. It’s a lie. It’s a lie.”
The woman, using two expletives, tells onlookers to “keep this” in New York, adding, “This is not happening in my town.”
The mural has been restored and residents were “maintaining a presence” to prevent further damage, Mr. Gomez had said.
In addition to the hate crime charges, the two people each face a charge of vandalism under $400 and possession of tools to commit vandalism or graffiti. All of the charges are misdemeanors and no court date has been scheduled, according to a spokesman for the district attorney’s office.
If convicted, the couple face up to a year in jail, the district attorney’s office said.
Efforts to reach Ms. Anderson and Mr. Nelson at multiple phone numbers on Tuesday night were not successful.
Separately, the Martinez police said Tuesday that they were investigating the illegal painting of “White Lives Matter” on a road elsewhere in the city. The police said in a statement that officers had found a woman painting over the white letters in black paint, and that they were trying to identify who had first painted the words.

The woman grabbed Taha by her hijab while the man approached her, according to Council on American-Islamic Relations's New York chapter (CAIR-NY).Aly demanded the suspects leave his wife alone, and they began attacking and beating him, telling the family, ""we are in America,"" calling Aly a ""fucking Muslim,"" and threatened to kill their family, according to the civil rights group.Aly, a 38-year-old Egyptian-American, was hospitalized and required surgery, CAIR-NY said. 
He was discharged on Monday evening.""We hope that law enforcement is taking this very seriously and investigates in a fair manner, and due to the anti-Muslim statements that were made at the time of the assault, that the Hate Crimes Task Force would be called into investigate and to decide through their investigation whether this is a biased motivated attack,"" said Ahmed Mohamed, the legal director for CAIR's New York chapter.The attack happened in front of the children, ages 6 and 8.""He and his family are going to be living through this nightmare for a very long time,"" Mohamed said.CAIR-NY said the two alleged attackers are two of the family's neighbors, who live in the same apartment complex, but NYPD has not yet arrested anyone in the case.""We're talking four days later and arrests haven't been made to an extremely violent crime,"" Mohamed said in an interview Tuesday afternoon. ""We know which apartment they're in.

The New York chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-NY), the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, has called on the New York City Police Department (NYPD) to investigate an alleged anti-Muslim assault and property damage incident as a hate crime.
On July 2, 2020, at approximately 11:45 p.m , Mr. Rashid Hassan, a Pakistani taxi driver, was the victim of an assault and property damage. Mr. Hassan was driving 3 young men in Brooklyn. As they approached their final drop-off destination in Flatbush, Brooklyn, two of the men began to kick and damage Mr. Hassan’s vehicle while the third individual, who was sitting in the seat behind Mr. Hassan, grabbed Mr. Hassan’s hair and yanked. Mr. Hassan exited the vehicle to tell the men to stop damaging his vehicle, and the men began to yell and use vulgar language. At that point, a fourth individual, who had not been in the vehicle, approached Mr. Hassan and punched him in the face. During the altercation, the men yelled “Go back to your country” and directed other anti-Muslim profanities and language towards Mr. Hassan.
The police and an ambulance were called to the scene. Mr. Hassan was taken to the hospital and may need surgery on his eye to prevent blindness due to a blood clot resulting from the assault. Another driver nearby recorded the incident and provided the footage to the responding officer(s). The NYPD has not indicated if the incident is being investigated by its Hate Crime Task Force.

CAIR-NY Litigation Director Ahmed Mohamed said:
“Bias-motivated attacks such as this one experienced by Mr. Hassan must be investigated as such, especially because of the increased number of such incidents targeting American Muslims and other minority communities. New Yorkers of all faiths should be able to perform their job and go about their business without fear of being subjected to violent acts motivated by hate and bigotry.”
He noted that CAIR has reported a spike in bigotry targeting American Muslims, immigrants and members of other minority groups since the election of Donald Trump as president.

Prosecutors announced Tuesday that Lorena Delaguna, 53, was charged with attempted assault and aggravated harassment, both as hate crimes, after being arrested the previous day for the August 17 incident.
Delaguna allegedly threw a glass bottle at jogger Tiffany Johnson, a Black woman, while yelling a slur and telling her to ""go back to Africa"" during an encounter on a city sidewalk.
""In addition to allegedly yelling the N-word, the defendant in this case is also accused of throwing a bottle in an attempt to strike the victim,"" Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz said in a press release. ""Crimes like this, which are fueled by hate, are in a special category for a reason.""
""No one should have to endure being called a vile slur or being attacked simply because of the color of their skin, their religion, or who they love,"" she added.
Delaguna failed to hit Johnson directly with the bottle, which shattered nearby and splashed liquid on the jogger. Johnson attempted to get away from Delaguna by leaving the area but was allegedly followed for at least a block while her assailant continued to shout threats.
""I don't like to have that type of energy around me, so I was like OK, I just need to get away from her, and to me walking away was the easiest way of doing that,"" Johnson told WNBC. ""She did follow me, kept pursuing me. People saw it, people were getting upset, somebody even threw a bagel in her direction... It was scary, I didn't want to see anyone get hurt, I just left.""
The New York City Police Department released a short surveillance video of part of the incident, lasting 9 seconds, on September 16.
The video shows a light-skinned woman, allegedly Delaguna, forcefully throw a bottle towards Johnson as she passes onto a crosswalk. It ends as the assailant shouts something that can not be heard before walking onto the crosswalk herself.
Johnson said she would prefer to move on and ""forget it ever happened,"" but was grateful that the incident was captured on video so it could be investigated by police. She added that she would tell her assailant to practice some self-reflection if they were to ever meet again.
""I'm not the n-word,"" said Johnson. ""Nobody is the n-word. She needs to do some soul searching as to why she needs somebody to be that because that's not what I am, that's not who we are.""
Delaguna is expected in court for her next hearing on Friday.

This study gathered 197 participants, interviewed within 48 hours of being victims of Hate Crime. This immediate follow-up should ensure accurate responses. The responses of the victims were compared to that of 113 Welsh front-line staff who respond to and support such victims. The barriers to reporting are found to be broadly similar with the findings of other UK studies. A considerable difference in understanding of the barriers to reporting hate crime was found between the victims and support services. The main reason given for non-reporting was common: the poor service, attitude and treatment from the police.
FULL TEXT
Introduction
This article will compare the findings of a study in Wales using Victim Support data with others from across the UK and will attempt to compare and contrast the findings, specifically looking at barriers to reporting identified by both victims of Hate Crime and frontline service providers across Wales. Service providers contributing to the research are from local authorities, the NHS, the police, housing associations, the probation service, the Crown Prosecution Service and third-sector organisations such as race equality councils, Citizens Advice and voluntary groups. This comparison will be contextualised within the regional and national policies adopted to prevent and support victims of hate crime and the Seven Key Decision Points in recognising and reporting hate crime, established by McDevitt et al. (2000). Hate Crime, Hate Incident, Bias Crime and Prejudicial Discrimination are all phrases associated with the classification of acts that target a victim for an aspect of their identity. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in England and Wales (2018) have outlined that race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity and disability are the protected characteristics for hate crime. 
There are two main aspects required in the legislation: first, that the act was a criminal offence, regardless of the motivation of the offender; second, that the act must have in part been committed and motivated out of prejudice towards the victim as a result of their protected characteristic. However, the hostility expressed by the perpetrator can be in many forms and the CPS and courts do not define this but ‘use the everyday understanding of the word which includes ill-will, spite, contempt, prejudice, unfriendliness, antagonism, resentment and dislike’ (CPS, 2018: 1). Thus the total definition of such an act is complex, subjective and potentially confusing, including establishing if the incident is a crime or not in its own right without the perceived hate elements.
The Welsh context
The Welsh Government established a Framework for Action to eliminate hostility and prejudice and to focus on early prevention to stop incidents escalating into crimes. This is supported by three strategies, prevention, supporting victims and improving multi-agency response, each with specific deliverables such as tackling hate-related bullying and promoting respect and delivering training and awareness in service delivery, for example specifying teacher education within this area within Wales and improving reporting rates (Welsh Government, 2018). As will be seen throughout this article the need for a fuller awareness by both victims and within the support services is crucial. The Welsh Government also works with the UK Government’s action plan Challenge It, Report It, Stop It! in non-devolved areas (Welsh Government, 2018). Following both national policy and the Welsh focus on multiagency working, third-party reporting schemes are used. Online systems are in place to report hate crime, that are heavily promoted by lobbying, and community interest groups through the internet and social media, such as Tell Mama, Stonewall, Stop Hate UK, Victim Support, in addition to the Home Office scheme True Vision and in Wales Victim Support Cymru.
The indicator most utilised for understanding rates of hate crime are the incidents reported to the police, who then refer them on to various other agencies for information and action. The situation within Wales is that victims of hate crime can report the occurrences directly to the police primarily using the 101 or 999 telephone numbers or other methods. Victims have the option of submitting a report online directly to the police through ‘True Vision’, the England and Wales third-party reporting website. Victims may also report directly to Victim Support Cymru, commissioned by the Welsh Government to support victims of hate within Wales and comprise the National Hate Crime Report and Support Centre Wales. The recording system in use in Wales means that when an incident is reported to the police, victim crime data is transferred automatically from the four Welsh police services using a data sharing agreement which is confidential, and involves anonymised data being analysed by the Welsh National Hate Crime Report and Support Centre.
The Welsh Government framework recognises that hate crime is underreported and aims to encourage increased reporting. This is in line with the UK in general, for example True Vision (2016), shows that in Wales there has been an increase of online reports of hate crime through the online mechanism, rising from 31 reports made in 2012/2013 to 120 reports made in 2015/2016. However, Torfaen People First (2012) documented that third-party reporting centres are effective in raising awareness of the issue, but are primarily based in settings, where opportunities to report such incidents already exist: For example, day opportunity centres, community education establishments or services focused upon protection of vulnerable adults. Consequently, the general community continues to have limited knowledge that the third party reporting centres exist. Despite the provision of online reporting, this lack of awareness is a national phenomenon as shown by Police Scotland who on the 17 March 2018 launched a major campaign to increase the awareness amongst potential perpetrators on the impact hate crime has upon victims and consider the damage caused by abuse related to hatred. This campaign was launched as a result of an increase of online reports of hate crime received by Scotland police. Assistant Chief Constable Gillian MacDonald states that, ‘We are aware that hate crime is often under-reported, however, Police Scotland is committed to reviewing and fully investigating all reports of hate.’ What then causes hate crime to be under-reported?
This article is part of an ongoing study into the reporting behaviour of victims in Wales that seeks to understand the complexities faced by victims when choosing to report a hate crime. Having a greater understanding of what motivates a victim of hate crime in Wales to report it, and their rationale for doing so or not reporting, will have a significant impact on the way the police in Wales coordinate activities to improve reporting and target interventions and crime reduction activities.
Barriers to reporting
Accurate identification of hate crimes and overcoming barriers that exist can be analysed using the Seven Key Decision Points (SKDP) as outlined by McDevitt et al. (2000). First, the victim needs to acknowledge that a crime has been committed, and second, the victim must have some perception that the crime may have been motivated by a bias towards them. Third, the matter must be reported to the police by the victim or another party, and fourth, the motivation behind the crime must be brought to the police’s attention. Fifth, the police need to acknowledge and recognise that a bias may have contributed to the motivation, and a sixth potential barrier is that the crime must be documented as a hate crime during the investigation. The last is that the hate crime when finalised must be accurately recorded as such. This section will explore some of the factors influencing each of these decision points and outline the ways in which actions and perceptions at these decision points may erect a barrier to reporting hate crimes and recording them accurately.
Victim perceptions and steps one to four in the SKDP
Victim perception is an important element in the SKDP process: whether the victim sees an incident as a crime, how serious a crime it is and whether they are aware of the hate element within the crime. It may be that victims are subjective when considering if they are victims and this may influence reporting rates. Gottfredson and Gottfredson (1988) identified the role of the victim in reporting based on the victim choices, and Bachman and Coker (1995) demonstrated that reporting behaviours can be linked to how serious the victim perceives the crime to be, with perceived lower-level crimes not being reported. This prompts the question as to where on a scale a victim would place the behaviour before they report as outlined with Allport (1979) considering the idea of ‘extermination’ compared to ‘spoken abuse’ on a five-scale basis. Christmann and Wong (2010) considered individual decision making on the reporting of hate crime based on what resources were available to influence these decisions. These findings demonstrated that victims had a lesser likelihood of making a full report to the police if the incident was non-criminal, as they perceived that the response would not be taken as seriously by the police. With this in mind, David (2000) concluded that if the victim’s perspectives were amended so that self-awareness was increased regarding the issue and the understanding of their needs was highlighted, then reporting behaviour would be increased. Williams and Tregidga (2013) in a study in Wales also found that victims prioritised reporting based on a perception of severity and, furthermore, it extended the decision-making rationale to include if the problem was an isolated incident or an escalating issue. An additional factor highlighted by Wickes et al. (2016) amongst the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) community, is that for some victims, they do not view themselves as a victim of hate crime, merely a victim of crime. Chakraborti et al. (2014) suggests that this lack of awareness of the victim as to what a hate crime is reduces reporting behaviour and that only the more violent acts are reported, such as assaults. This assessment was also documented by Williams and Tregidga (2013), where less serious crimes were seen to go unreported or, as Harlow (2005) suggests, that the matter had been dealt with in another way. Browne et al. (2011) found that avoidance, and remaining in shared social circles, were some responses employed by victims, because of abuse becoming normalised, suggesting that front-line service provision have failed.
A second important victim perception is how the police respond to reporting a hate crime. Balboni and McDevitt (2001) found that where confidence was high between minority groups and the police, hate crime reporting would be increased from these groups, especially where the police had a diverse workforce representing different strands of the community to which they serve. This idea conforms to the concept of ‘procedural justice’ wherein communities engage with the police if they think that they are fair, equitable and respectful (Sunshine and Tyler, 2003).
 Marshall and Webb (1995) considered reported crime rates amongst minority communities and have outlined that minority communities are less likely to consider reporting crime to the police. Terrill et al. (2003) claim this to be a result of negative perceptions of interactions with the police. These perceptions are emphasised through police approaches to arrests and stop-searches when drugs are a factor (Beckett et al., 2006), whereby it is felt that racial minorities are unfairly targeted and are dealt with more vigorously.
 Zaykowski (2010) found that generally minority victims reported less and Harlow (2005) has attempted to link reporting rates to the relationship of the victim and offender and makes the point that over half of crimes committed against victims are carried out by unknown offenders. Herek et al. (1999) demonstrated, despite suggestions that gay victims being more likely to report hate crimes, that overall reporting rates for crimes against gay victims are lower than for non-gay victims. This, they claim, is based on a perception regarding police treatment and the response they would receive based on their sexual orientation. Furthermore, Herek et al. (1999) found when gay victims have a low perception of police response, this reduces the likelihood of reporting the matter. This type of barrier has been coined ‘secondary victimisation’ by Nolan and Akiyama (1999), who believe that victims of anti-gay crime fear citing examples of insensitivity and abuse by police (NYCGL Anti-Violence Project, 1995). Miles-Johnson (2013) considered the Theory of Planned Behaviour (Ajzen, 1985), which is used to link attitudes and beliefs to intention and behaviour, and applied it to measure the willingness of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) victims or persons to report crime to the police in comparison to the wider community. The research showed that LGBTI participants are less likely to report crime to the police because of having a belief that the police are homophobic (Wickes et al., 2016), and reporting rates amongst that group will not improve until these perceptions are positively altered.
An additional factor that hinders reporting is that the victim may fear being stigmatised. Wickes et al. (2016) highlighted that some LGBTI victims, having not identified their sexuality or identity to family, therefore do not have the option available to report a hate crime. These negative perceptions and low confidence in the police have inevitably resulted in an under-reporting of LGBTI crimes to the police (Chakraborti, 2009).
 Saxton et al. (2001) found people with disabilities felt that the police will not believe them and not investigate the matter fully, resulting in greater burdens of stress upon the victim with a disability. Milliner (2014) found in South Wales that some people with learning difficulties were afraid of the uniform and could not approach officers as it was too daunting, and that some would prefer to report via a support worker. She found that others would not even report to their social worker in case they were deemed to be unable to cope and might be further institutionalised. Whereas Sobsey (1994) believes that language and communication barriers exist when people with a disability look to report crimes, which result in less detail being obtained about an incident, which would reduce the likelihood of a remedy being enforced. Milliner (2014) found cases where the victims stated that they were ‘told off’ for reporting incidents. Wickes et al. (2016) looked at language barriers that existed from the authority’s perspective and found that there was a greater need for more inclusive and enabling language around hate crime, to assist in the increasing of hate crime reporting levels, which has also been documented by Langton and Planty (2011).
In a study carried out by the Leicester University Hate Crime Project Chakraborti et al. (2014) participants predominantly outlined that they would not report the matter due to a perception in that the police would not take it seriously or not do anything to resolve the issue. This was also evidenced in an all-Wales-based study (Williams and Tregidga, 2013), which highlighted the same victim perceptions regarding not reporting.
Similarly, Saxton et al. (2001) and Milliner (2014) found that people with disabilities also believed that the police will not believe them and not investigate the matter fully, resulting in greater burdens of stress upon the victim with a disability. This lack of action by the police may also lead to more exposure to retaliation by the criminal. The victim may also hold a perception that rather than dealing with the matter as a criminal investigation, that the police would notify social services. Child et al. (2010) states that previous experiences have influenced the reporting rationale and behaviour of a victim with a disability negatively, and suggested that other victims have not reported, as they do not want to be viewed socially as having a disability. A further barrier may be that some people with a disability believe that to report such abuse is a negative trait and that it is more acceptable for the victim to ignore crimes against them rather than be viewed as a complainer by society (Carlson, 1997).
If victims do not feel that support services can resolve the matter and protect them then they are unlikely to report hate crime. Cantos (2006) documents how victims with a disability feel powerless as victims in a hate crime situation and misperceive that suffering violent encounters are their fault. It could be considered that the more socially isolated the victim living with a disability is, the more likely they are to have a feeling of personal powerlessness, which increases their fear that to report the matter may lead to retaliation by the offender (Petersilia et al., 2001). Fear of retaliation may in some circumstances have a greater meaning, where a victim living with a disability relies upon the offender for care or support due to a disability. This fear may manifest itself as losing independence, or day-to-day functions such as personal hygiene and money management (Petersilia et al., 2001, Andrews and Veronen, 1993). Several studies demonstrated that for some victims, the fear or retaliation hinders the decision to report a hate crime (Chakraborti et al., 2014; Wickes et al., 2016; Wong and Christmann, 2008).
It is therefore clear that fair treatment of victims is required whereby the police validate the victim experiences, which in turn allows victims to feel empowered and able to gain some closure over the incident (Bradford et al., 2013), and by doing so increase reporting behaviour (Sargeant et al., 2014). This is the main element of procedural justice, but more is needed. The victim must have confidence that some meaningful action will be taken and that this will result in fewer hate incidents if victims report more. So, contrary to Hough et al. (2010), efficiency and effectiveness are important factors to increase a victim’s engagement, reporting and support for the police and criminal justice service. This perception may have increased since the Welsh survey following a media campaign in late 2018 (e.g., Wild West Britain out of Control, Daily Mail headline, 2 November 2018) exposing the higher demand on the police service coupled with the reduced number of police officers following 10 years of austerity (Daily Express, 2018). A survey in November 2018 found that 55% of respondents were more concerned about being a victim of crime than they were a year ago (Survation, 2018).
Accurate police identification steps five to seven in the SKDP
 Wickes et al. (2016) states that the police are not always able to identify accurately when a hate crime is taking place. The misidentification of hate crimes by police has been raised previously by McDevitt (1987) and Levin (1992), with some examples citing an unwillingness by the police to raise the profile of a minor case through labelling it as a hate crime, as the investigation may become too burdensome or sensationalise the crime reported. There is also the issue that hate crimes require an assessment of all factors that contribute to the crime to be weighed up and at times this can be subjective, in turn leading to a unique set of issues when attempting to accurately record them (Nolan and Akiyama, 1999), whereas other examples suggested that police officers held the opinion that all crimes of a similar level of severity should be treated equally, and not on the basis of motive (Nolan and Akiyama, 1999). It is this ‘organisational conditioning’ outlined by Levin (1992) that seeks to inhibit the understanding and importance of hate crimes from a community-wide perspective. Assessing the issues that lead to classification errors is particularly important as it ultimately influences the accuracy of National Crime Figures as far as hate crimes are concerned (Nolan et al., 2011). Nolan et al. (2015) demonstrates that the under-counting of hate crimes within official figures was the largest barrier surrounding the accurate picture of hate crime. This has been exacerbated through a plethora of interpretations of the definition of hate crime and how it should be applied not only by victims, but predominantly by different police force areas and organisations and the officers responsible for investigating them.
A focus on the agenda appears to be key also, as Clayton et al. (2016) found that levels of reporting of hate crimes had reduced in line with reduced prioritisation and resourcing. The retrenchment from reduction in resourcing and different typologies of neighbourhood policing (Higgins, 2017) suggests that police officers are more likely to be ‘strangers in uniform’ (Milliner, 2014) and have less time to build up a picture of minor incidents escalating to serious hate crimes. The Welsh government is committed to the continuation of Community Support Officers via ring-fenced funding to maintain CSO numbers within neighbourhood policing teams. Unfortunately, a discussion on the future of neighbourhood policing, which the authors feel to be a major element in recognising and supporting victims, is beyond the scope of this article. However, the balance between reactive and preventative policing is a major question for the police service, as is whether the recent signal from the UK government to increase policing budgets (Knowles, 2018) will be sufficient to halt the retrenchment away from neighbourhood policing.
The Welsh study
Service providers survey
As part of the Welsh government’s framework for action on hate crime, training sessions were delivered to 24 groups with 113 participants from across service providers operating in Wales, between November 2014 and March 2015, which included housing, local authorities, police services, Crown Prosecution Service, the probation service, the National Health Service, Citizens Advice and the voluntary sector. Although all service providers were experienced practitioners, a one-hour awareness session on hate crime to ensure that each participant was fully aware of the term and its legal definition (an overview of s. 145 and 146 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003) was given immediately before the focus groups, including an explanation of each of the five protected characteristics covered by the definition of hate crime, in addition to a hate crime case study for each of the five protected characteristics. These comprised: Brent Martin targeted for having a disability, Jonny Delany targeted and murdered for being a Gypsy Traveller, Lee Rigby murdered by al Qaeda-influenced individuals, Jodi Dobrowski murdered for being perceived as gay and Dee Jenkins targeted for gender transitioning from male to female. Participants also received five case studies, anonymised referrals into the National Hate Crime Report and Support Centre Wales (one per protected characteristic covered by the hate crime definition).
This provided potential respondents for a study with a consistent level of knowledge. From this, 24 focus groups were coordinated, with 113 participants providing consent to utilise their responses, to identify how front-line services within Wales perceived the way in which victims report hate crime and use their experience as a front-line service to suggest why victims do not report. Essentially this data represents the Welsh front-line service position on perceived barriers of reporting hate and suggestions on how to remove such barriers.
Participants had 10 minutes to discuss with other participants within the focus group what barriers they believe may exist that prevent a victim of hate crime reporting the occurrence to a front-line or emergency service. The participants were then asked to provide their responses verbally; these were written on a flipchart visible to the participants at the front of the room. Once all of the responses were clearly displayed on the flipchart, the participants were given a further 10 minutes to discuss ways in which these barriers could be removed or mitigated to enable a victim to report a hate crime. Participants then gave their responses verbally when prompted against each barrier previously identified, and these were recorded on the flipchart accordingly. An independent person (GC) ran the focus groups as All Wales Hate Crime Manager to try to remove any fear of any individual’s comments or attitudes being fed back into their organisation. The aim was for open discussion, but the authors acknowledge that focus groups may limit individuals’ truthfulness and full participation by all members.
Victims survey
Victim Support Cymru (VSC) collects data routinely, and a victim’s data and experience are transferred automatically between the four police forces in Wales and VSC. There is a clear service-level agreement in place for the process, and it is inclusive of implied consent for the victim to be contacted. The victim is therefore automatically opted in, both to be contacted for an offer of support services and for this research to be carried out using their data, unless they request to opt out.
Under this arrangement a series of seven questions were formulated to identify the reporting rationale of victims of hate crime. To ensure the most immediate response from the victim to encapsulate the raw emotion and feelings, thereby generating a more genuine emotional response, the questions were asked at the point of initial contact with the victim, which is within 48 hours of reporting the crime. Asking at initial contact also ensures the welfare of the victim, as they are provided with immediate emotional support to help them overcome the crime and a needs assessment is carried out to see what additional support they may require. The operators whom carry out the initial contact are trained in hate crime and only contact such victims. The questions were fully explained to the staff and they were supervised during the calls to ensure data quality and consistency was maintained. Victims were informed that they can opt out at any time and a unique reference number was created to ensure that the responses recorded were anonymous. The responses were entered into an Excel document and grouped into categories with the most appropriate heading.
This is a sensitive issue, and victims contacted within 48 hours of an incident may not want to reveal fully all their thoughts and feelings. Thus it may be that some victims did not fully engage in their responses. Furthermore, this data is from those who have reported, as this methodology does not reach non-reporting victims. Nonetheless, lessons can be learned from these respondents. The short time-lapse between incident and interview should provide a fuller, richer and more accurate recall and hence should remove some memory/recall inaccuracies that might be associated with annual surveys such as the CSEW.
A comparison of motivating factors between England and Wales
The distribution of reasons for hate crimes in Wales is different to that in England: Table 1 shows a higher percentage based upon the protected characteristics of both sexual orientation and disability and lower percentages for both race and religion. As discussed above, reporting barriers may be different for each of these categories. Disability hate crime is particularly more frequent in the Welsh survey, and in all surveys racial hate crime is dominant.

 Cuerden and Rogers (2015) found that males are almost twice as likely to report hate crime. In terms of age profile, the ages that range between 16 and 45 have the highest levels of reporting, accounting for 64% of the sample, with the greatest concentration stemming from the 26 to 35 age range (24.3%).
It is worth noting that the 16 to 25 age range has the second highest level of reporting (18.1%). This, Cuerden and Rogers (2015) suggest, may be due to awareness-type education in schools and colleges, which has been commonly seen across Wales since the implementation of the Welsh Government Hate Crime Framework. A recent ‘Resilience’ intervention, funded by the Welsh government, has started to further promote diversity and ethics within Welsh schools. Alternatively, this age group may experience higher rates of hate crimes, with 90% of Scottish children with learning difficulties experiencing bullying at school (Enable Scotland, 2017).
Comparisons of victims and service providers perceptions
Data obtained from VSC between 18 August 2015 and 26 September 2016 gathered 197 consenting victims of hate crime. Due to some participants providing multiple responses, it should be noted that there was a total of 209 victim responses within Table 2 and 206 victim responses in Table 3. Tables 2 and 3 contrast the views of the 113 service providers with those of hate crime reporting victims.

This mapping is based upon the authors’ understanding of the sentiments expressed by the two groups.
The seriousness of the crime may also affect the reporting rate. Corcoran et al. (2015) found that overall, 48% of hate crime incidents were reported to the police, and that this was similar to the proportion of hate crimes in previous CSEW surveys. This is a higher figure than for overall CSEW crime in the same time periods, which was 40%. Corcoran et al. (2015) suggest that this is due to different patterns of seriousness of hate crimes compared to crime overall; for example, violent crime in general has higher reporting rates and this is a higher proportion of hate crimes reported (49% of hate compared 19% of overall CSEW crime). Supporting this relationship, it is found that reporting to the police for theft incidents overall is a lower figure (40%). A very similar pattern was found in this Welsh survey of victims where, Assault Occasioning Bodily Harm was experienced in 48% of the crimes, followed by harassment (29%) and public order offences (16%). These higher reported rates of hate violence may reflect the earlier findings that violent crime is more likely to be reported or that victims of hate crime are more likely to suffer violence within hate crimes. Until the reporting rate for hate crime improves, this question cannot be determined.
As can be seen clearly in Table 2, the main barrier for victims is the ‘police’ which makes up 33.5% of the total responses. This category encapsulated feelings that to report an issue would be ‘a waste of police time’; that the ‘Police won’t do anything’; ‘the police do not take the matter seriously’; ‘a poor police service has been received previously’; that ‘nothing will get done’ and that there are ‘bad relations with the police’. This can be compared with other studies in Table 2, which also show this category to be the main barrier to reporting in other UK studies.
 Corcoran et al. (2015) found from the combined 2012/13 to 2014/15 CSEW surveys, that 52% of hate crime victims were very or fairly satisfied with how the police handled their report, a lower rate than for victims of crime overall (73% very or fairly satisfied). Conversely, hate crime victims had a higher rate of being very dissatisfied (35%) with the police handling their case than the overall victim response in the CSEW (14%). This may again be partially related to a different pattern of crimes committed to hate crime victims, as discussed above. Corcoran et al. (2015) compared satisfaction of victims of violent hate crime with the police (46% were very or fairly satisfied) to that of victims of overall violent crime incidents (68%), showing a considerably lower level of satisfaction. However, they do point out that the violent hate crime responses are from a relatively small dataset.
 Corcoran et al. (2015: 22) also found from the combined 2012/13 to 2014/15 surveys that: victims of hate crime were less likely to think the police had treated them fairly or with respect, compared with victims of CSEW crime overall. For example, in 59 per cent of hate crime incidents the victims thought the police treated them fairly, compared with 81 per cent of incidents of CSEW crime overall. Similarly, in 79 per cent of incidents of hate crime, victims thought the police treated them with respect, compared with 89 per cent of incidents of CSEW crime overall. Thus the findings in this study agree with those of previous studies that show that hate crime victims find that the police response is poor and in need of major improvement.
Equally worryingly, 14.8% of the victims feel that hate crimes have become a normalised part of life and that, as such, to report them would mean nothing, as they occur so frequently. Again, the comparisons show that this is an important factor in the other UK studies. The Suffolk Hate Crime Survey in 2012 found a very similar rate, and these are both considerably higher than that found in the earlier CSEW (Table 2). This increase may be due to time, a motivating factor of regional/cultural differences.
Furthermore, hate crime victims have been found to be more negatively affected by the crime experienced than is generally the case, with Corcoran et al. (2015) reporting that victims of hate crime more frequently stated that they were emotionally affected by the incident (92% and 81% respectively) and also responded as ‘very much’ affected at a considerably higher rate (36% and 13% respectively). This analysis also suggests that this higher level of emotional impact is not due to the type of hate crimes experienced, as victims of violent crime tend to be less likely to say they were emotionally affected than victims of other crime types.
Fear of reprisal may be increasing over time, with response rates of 3.6% in 2009–2011 (CSEW) 9.9% in 2012 (Suffolk) and 17.7% in 2016 (Wales), unless the crime type mapping proposed within Table 2 is too compartmentalised, with ‘Afraid’ and ‘Private issue dealt with ourselves’ also being to avoid reprisal and hence overlapping with ‘Repercussions’. If this is the case, the trend is fairly constant across time. with values of 17.1% in 2009–2011 (CSEW) 15.5% in 2012 (Suffolk) but 33.5% in 2016 (Wales) perhaps showing a regional or motivating factor (particular type of hate) variation in the Welsh response.
Other factors, such as fear of reporting itself, continue to present themselves as barriers. However, there are more intricate examples provided, such as a ‘fuelling of the issue by the media’ and that the process from reporting to desired outcome seems ‘too slow’, perhaps an indicator of changes in standards expected or a torch-light on an ever-criticised area of policing. As discussed above, the level of police funding and changing emphasis on preventive policing may be important factors in supporting victims and reporting rates. In a recent Survation survey, 81% of respondents favoured increasing police officer numbers, reflecting the greater fear of crime found in the survey. This in turn may lead to lower reporting rates as the media emphasises the lack of police capacity to attend all reported crime.
A small percentage (2.4%) state that feelings of being ashamed are causing an inhibition to report, prompting questions as to whether social change is what is really needed to facilitate true cohesion and understanding to the complexities contained within crimes of bias and prejudice. This factor was not revealed within the earlier studies, although inhibitions due to cultural norms in specific groups such as the Gypsy and Traveller community, the Chinese community and the Polish community have been identified (Wong et al., 2013).
Welsh service providers gave the same main reason for non-reporting by victims of hate crime – that of poor police response, including all the factors mentioned earlier, such as not being believed, poor relations and lack of trust with the police, lack of action by the police etc. However, Welsh service providers had a much higher belief that ‘fear’ and ‘shame’ were barriers than the victims’ responses (e.g. Fear 27.5% vs 15.8%). Furthermore, they had a response of 7.4% around communication barriers and not knowing how to report, a level which is not revealed in any of the other three victim surveys in Table 2. Furthermore, despite the higher frequency of disability hate crime within the Welsh sample, only 1% of the victims gave this reason. This may be because those with communication barriers under-report, relative to those not experiencing such a barrier, or that service providers are out of tune with victims’ feelings. Overall, there is a considerable mismatch between victims’ and providers’ beliefs within Wales.
When Welsh service providers were asked how such perceived barriers may be removed, as shown in Table 3, providers suggest that to ‘market support’ and to ‘make staff aware of procedures’ are the most prevalent concepts. A further suggestion, to ‘explain confidentiality’, was voiced, despite the need for the victim to attend court when pursuing a criminal complaint; perhaps this response was referring to the need to improve ‘trust’ and to demonstrate that organisations are listening to victims’ needs and taking the topic seriously. ‘Build trust’ only represented 10.7% of the service providers’ responses, which seems very low if service providers were seeking to provide procedural justice for the victims.
How, then, do the victim responses differ from service providers’ responses and perceptions? Table 3 highlights that victims see the need for a more ‘open door’ approach by the police, so that the public is better able to see how the police respond in these matters and the different aspects of policing involved in dealing with the matter (39.7%), versus the service providers’ main response of marketing support (39.3%), which would appear to be expressing similar sentiments. Second from the victims’ perspective is the need for action to be taken promptly and effectively when a matter is reported (17.5%), suggesting that the victims sampled have considered the response received following reporting the hate crime to be less than they would expect. Support also features in victim (12.1%) responses, and these two aspects map against service providers’ response of ‘Staff aware of procedures’ (26.2%), to maximise the response and support given to victims. However, it is notable that victims require more swift and harsher punitive action to be taken against offenders (10.2%), coupled with feelings that the current mechanisms to report hate are not considered safe during and following a report being made (6.8%), yet these issues are not found in the service providers’ feedback. There is also an aspect of ownership of reporting, with victims feeling that more should be done surrounding empowerment, so that victims can help themselves, and service providers thought that more education would reduce barriers reflecting this issue. Such a response could be an indicator that as a result of policing processes and perceived inadequate timescales and punishments for the problem, that the public have lost faith in the system and are seeking to regain control. To facilitate empowerment and help stem repeat hate incidents, perhaps restorative justice should be used alongside punishment of perpetrators.
A sample of five responses taken from the victim responses will enrich the meaning behind the data: ‘Have a campaign so that everyone can report these things together to try and encourage people. Let them know that they are not alone. Better media portrayal of police as the media show they are dropping in standards and procedures.’‘For the police to have a solid procedure that they adhere to with every case of hate crime. Not to brush it under the carpet like it’s nothing and to protect the victim and not to sympathise with the offender. For the police to show impartiality and to not show any tendencies of discrimination themselves. Police to build a rapport with victims. Victims knowing that organisations are going to help them when they promise them support and help, rather than promising and not doing anything – it creates mistrust.’‘To be reassured that if they report it that it would be taken seriously. For the police to realise that hate crime can be very distressing for victims and for them to show the same compassion as VSC towards victims, by seeing their side of the argument and sympathising with them. Just because it’s a verbal altercation doesn’t mean it can’t have the same negative effects on victims as larger and more “serious” crimes.’‘Make sure that victims know that they are safe when they report and that something is going to be done about it – more than just a warning. Police do a good job currently but historically people don’t have much faith in them, particularly the groups of people that are victims of hate crime as the police have also discriminated against them in the past.’‘Improve society’s views on different ethnic cultures to improve people’s ignorance and understandings of others, it is narrowmindedness that causes hate crime and racism and that needs to be changed as we currently live in a very hostile country for any ethnicity other than British.’
The victim’s responses suggest a lack of confidence in the Criminal Justice Service to serve and protect the victim, i.e. a lack of procedural justice and police legitimacy. Considering the Seven Key Decision Points (McDevitt et al., 2000), in this study steps one and two have been taken by the victims of hate crime who reported (the sample). Step three is a major barrier to respondents, with victims perceiving that reporting a hate incident to the police is not going to help them and may make matters worse. This latter aspect – a lack of efficiency – appears to be an equally important aspect to fair treatment and is runs counter to some proponents of procedural justice, who claim that this is not an important factor.
Furthermore, with regard to steps five to seven, improved understanding, sensitivity and empathy are required by the police and other service providers to support the victim in their time of need. This may be a severe challenge to retrain and find time to fully support victims when front-line providers are dealing with ever-increasing demands and static or decreasing resources.
Conclusion
There is a clear endorsement looking at the data that ‘procedural justice’ as outlined by Sunshine and Tyler (2003) needs improvement within Wales to ensure communities engage with the police and other agencies when considering reporting hate incidents. Herek et al. (1999) support this study’s findings that there is low perception of a positive and successful police response leading to a reduced likelihood of reporting. It is interesting that victims feel that a greater transparency of the police response is needed, which further endorses this sentiment.
Additional data in this study supports the following notions: that for some, behaviours are being normalised (Browne et al., 2011); that fear is also documented in the data as a barrier experienced in reporting, either as fear of repercussions or because of what reporting means to them (Chakraborti et al., 2014; Wickes et al., 2016; Wong and Christmann, 2008); and that there is a lack of awareness among some victims of what a hate crime is (Chakraborti et al., 2014).
The research demonstrate that victims perceive that social change is required and that the justice system is unsympathetic, too slow and inefficient in dealing with the issue, with harsher and swifter punishments being required to effect trust in the system.
There is also an obvious difference between the victim perspective and the service provider perspective on the matter of reporting barriers and solutions, emphasising that more should be done to bridge the gap between the two cohorts.
Although the data presented is only an early interrogation of the data, it does bring new learning and reinforces literature from within the field. A full analysis of the data obtained and the new perspectives it brings will be published in due course. For now, however, there is a definitive need for police to validate victim experiences in which empowerment and trust are gained (Bradford et al., 2013).

The New York chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-NY), the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, today welcomed the arrest of one of the two alleged attackers in a vicious assault launched against a Muslim father in front of his wife and children on November 6, 2020 in Rego Park, Queens. The second alleged perpetrator remains at large and the investigation is ongoing.
Earlier this week, CAIR-NY called on the NYPD to initiate a hate crime probe.
SEE: Video: CAIR-NY Calls for Hate Crime Probe After Muslim Father Assaulted, Called ‘F***ing Muslim’
According to Michael Brovner, Chief of the Hate Crimes Bureau at the Queens District Attorney’s office, Giselle DeJesus was arrested last night, November 12, 2020, and charged with one count of Assault in the Second Degree as a Hate Crime, three counts of Aggravated Harassment in the Second Degree, four counts of Endangering the Welfare of a Child, and one count of Disorderly Conduct.
The victims of the alleged hate crime, 38-year-old Egyptian-American Khaled Aly and his wife, Neamat Taha, and their two children, have yet to return to their home out of fear for their safety. On November 6, 2020 the family had just parked their car in their parking spot when the assailants confronted them and began to harass Taha. Taha wears a hijab, an Islamic headscarf. The female assailant grabbed Taha while the male assailant began to aggressively approach Taha. Prior to grabbing Taha, the assailants told the family that “we are in America” and the female assailant called her a “f***ing Muslim. ” Aly asked the assailants to leave them alone and to not touch his wife. Without warning, the assailants then attacked Aly and viciously beat him while his kids watched in horror. During the assault, the assailants repeatedly cursed at Aly and the female assailant called him a “f***ing Muslim” and the male assailant threatened to “kill your f***ing family. ” Aly was immediately rushed to the hospital where he was hospitalized and underwent surgery for his ‎injuries. Aly was released from the hospital Monday evening. ‎
Note: CAIR-NY represents Aly and his family.

In a statement CAIR-NY Legal Director Ahmed Mohamed stated:
“We are grateful that one of the suspects has been taken into custody—and appropriately charged with a hate crime. We are hopeful that the male suspect will soon be arrested and charged so that the family can feel safe again. No individual should ever be targeted in a manner such as this. We thank the 112th precinct for their diligent work so far and appreciate the guidance of Mr. Brovner from the Queens District Attorney’s office. We will continue to advocate for the family and ensure that justice is served. ”

Town Board[1] (and then reposted by N.Y. state senator Pete Harckham[2]):Make no mistake, to refute the belief that BLACK LIVES MATTER in any way, shape, or form, through words, actions, vandalism, or destruction IS A HATE CRIME.The statement is in response to what appears to be the burning of a Black Lives Matter sign that had been put up at a local Quaker meeting house; and that of course is a crime, which should be punished. (It's not clear to me whether it's a hate crime under New York law[3], since it doesn't seem to be motivated by the religion of the Quakers, or the race of any particular person; in any event, though, it's certainly a crime even apart from that.)But the language of the Town Board doesn't focus on this being vandalism or arson—rather, it focuses on the action ""refut[ing] the belief that BLACK LIVES MATTER"" (presumably using ""refute"" in the sense of ""deny or contradict"" rather than ""prove wrong""), which is to say on the political viewpoint that the vandalism and arson express. 
And, to make that clear, the Town Board says that ""refut[ing this] belief"" ""in any way, shape, or form,"" including ""through words"" (the first item in that list) ""IS A HATE CRIME."" That's targeting not just a viewpoint expressed through ""vandalism"" or criminal ""destruction,"" but also through ""words.""At this point this seems like just political rhetoric, and not a threat of prosecution for ""refut[ing] through words"" that could lead to a legal challenge. But it's political rhetoric that strikes me as quite sharply at odds with First Amendment principles, which I thought worth mentioning.Thanks to Zhengxi (Larry) Liu for the pointer.

An attorney for Nicole Claudia Anderson, 42, and David Richard Nelson, 53, called the hate crime charges against the couple as 'outrageous,' claiming[1] a 'highly politicized' district attorney was pushing for the charges, according to 6ABC. Anderson and Nelson were each charged with three misdemeanors — violation of civil rights, vandalism, and possession of tools to commit vandalism or graffiti. 
A defense attorney for the couple said that his clients have the right to show their disagreement with how their tax dollars are being spent. 'Just as peaceful protesters have the right to march and display their political views in a myriad of different ways, they have the same right to display their dissatisfaction and disagreement with their tax dollars being used to sponsor a radical organization, Black Lives Matter,'Bill Essayli said outside the courthouse. Essayli, who in 2018 unsuccessfully ran for the California State Assembly as a Republican, is representing Anderson and Nelson along with the Center for American Liberty (CAL), per[2] The Mercury News. CAL is a Virginia-based nonprofit organization that filed a lawsuit[3] against Gov.Gavin Newsom(D) last month to compel the governor to re-open the state's schools. 'We think the charges here frankly are outrageous. It's something I've never seen as a former prosecutor, the law used in that matter,' Essayli said. 'The fact that my clients disagree with (Black Lives Matter's) mission is a problem for the DA and she is charging them with a hate crime.' As previously reported[4] by Law&#38;Crime, a video whichwent viral over the July 4 weekend showed two people-allegedly Anderson and Nelson—spreading black paint over the yellow lettered-mural with paint rollers. The man in the video wore a MAGA hat and a red shirt that said, 'Four More Years' and can be heard arguing with bystanders filming the couple's conduct. 'No one wants Black Lives Matter here, that's what I said,' he told one bystander who approached him with a cell phone. 'All Lives Matter, you fucking punk.' He continued to lecture the bystanders, saying, 'Keep America Great Again, that's right. Why don't you guys learn about history, and the Emancipation Proclamation Act?' The man did most of the talking, but the woman made a couple of brief outbursts. 'Keep this shit in fucking New York,' she said, adding, 'This is not happening in my town.' District Attorney Diana Becton declined to comment on Essayli's claims, but last month said the defaced mural was meant to be 'a peaceful and powerful way to communicate the importance of Black lives in Contra Costa County and the country.'

The Muslim-Jewish Advisory Council (MJAC) is deeply troubled by the new Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) assessment of hate crimes in the United States. The Hate Crimes Statistics report shows 7,314 hate crime incidents in 2019, up slightly from the 7,120 incidents reported in 2018. Incidents targeting Jews were up 14 percent compared to last year. While hate crimes against Muslims decreased slightly in 2019, they remain the next largest target of crimes based on religious bias.
""Muslims and Jews across America remain primary targets of crimes motivated by sheer hatred, but no ethnic or faith group is immune,"" said MJAC Co-chair Stanley Bergman. ""The persistence of and continuing increase in hate crimes demands urgent attention and action.""
The annual FBI report grossly underestimates the number of hate crimes, as participation by local law enforcement agencies in the FBI's hate crime data collection system is not mandatory. A 2019 study by the bipartisan U.S. Commission on Civil Rights identified ""massive underreporting"" of hate crimes, resulting in ""far-reaching deleterious effects in terms of investigations and also for the prevention efforts for all.""
In the FBI's data for 2019, 71 cities with a population of 100,000 residents or more reported zero hate crimes or did not submit any data. According to the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics, Americans experience an average of 250,000 hate crimes each year, but most are not reported to the police.
MJAC calls on the U.S. Congress to pass the Jabara-Heyer National Opposition to Hate, Assaults, and Threats to Equality (NO HATE) Act before the end of the current congressional session. This measure will incentivize state and local law enforcement authorities to improve hate crime reporting by making grants available, to be managed through the Department of Justice. The grants, authorized from existing funds, will provide resources such as law enforcement trainings, the creation of reporting hotlines, increased resources to liaise with affected communities, and public educational forums on hate crimes. The bill also amends the penalties for hate crimes to allow courts to require offenders to undertake educational classes or community service related to the victim's community as a condition of release.
""The measures laid out in the NO HATE Act will significantly improve our understanding of hate crimes and help law enforcement respond more effectively,"" said MJAC Co-chair Farooq Kathwari. ""We applaud the many members of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, who have come together in unity to support this important legislation.""
MJAC has been advocating for the passage of the NO HATE Act since its bicameral introduction in June 2019. The bill was introduced in the Senate as the Khalid Jabara and Heather Heyer National Opposition to Hate, Assaults, and Threats to Equality Act by Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and its companion legislation in the House by Representatives Don Beyer (D-VA) and Pete Olson (R-TX). In the House, the NO HATE Act passed with bipartisan support as part of the HEROES Act. MJAC hopes to see the NO HATE Act included in a coronavirus response package or passed independently in the Senate.
MJAC is a civil society coalition co-convened by American Jewish Committee (AJC) and Islamic Society of North America (ISNA). Founded in 2016, MJAC brings together civil society, religious, and business leaders from across the U.S. to advocate for domestic policy issues of common concern. MJAC's national council and eleven regional councils, in Dallas, Detroit, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Louisville, Miami, New Jersey, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. represent a network of hundreds of Muslim and Jewish leaders committed to working together for the good of both communities and the country. MJAC stands at the forefront of those confronting hatred against religious minorities and has made stemming the rise in hate crimes a key advocacy area of focus."

Based on a survey of 593 lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people in the United Kingdom, this study shows that direct anti-LGBT hate crimes (measured by direct experiences of victimization) and indirect anti-LGBT hate crimes (measured by personally knowing other victims of hate crime) are highly prolific and frequent experiences for LGBT people. Our findings show that trans people are particularly susceptible to hate crimes, both in terms of prevalence and frequency. This article additionally highlights the negative emotional and (intended) behavioral reactions that were correlated with an imagined hate crime scenario, showing that trans people are more likely to experience heightened levels of threat, vulnerability, and anxiety compared with non-trans LGB people. The study found that trans people are also more likely to feel unsupported by family, friends, and society for being LGBT, which was correlated with the frequency of direct (verbal) abuse they had previously endured. The final part of this study explores trans people’s confidence levels in the Government, the police, and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in relation to addressing hate crime. In general, trans people felt that the police are not effective at policing anti-LGBT hate crime, and they are not respectful toward them as victims; this was especially true where individuals had previous contact with the police. Respondents were also less confident in the CPS to prosecute anti-LGBT hate crimes, though the level of confidence was slightly higher when respondents had direct experience with the CPS. The empirical evidence presented here supports the assertion that all LGBT people, but particularly trans individuals, continue to be denied equal participation in society due to individual, social, and structural experiences of prejudice. The article concludes by arguing for a renewed policy focus that must address this issue as a public health problem.
FULL TEXT
Introduction
Over the past two decades, a growing body of research has developed on the impacts of hate crime (see inter alia, Herek, Cogan, & Gillis, 2002; Herek, Cogan, Gillis, & Glunt, 1997; Iganski, 2008; Iganski & Lagou, 2015; McDevitt, Balboni, Garcia, & Gu, 2001). These studies have shed important light on both the disproportionate levels of targeted abuse experienced by certain minority groups and the heightened impacts that hate crimes are likely to have on victims. In the main, research has shown that hate crime victims are more likely to experience emotional traumas such as shock, anxiety, fear, anger, and depression (see, for example, Corcoran, Lader, & Smith, 2015; Iganski, 2008). Some researchers have also shown that certain psychological impacts (such as depression) can last for longer periods of time when compared with nonhate motivated victimization (Herek et al., 1997). Studies have also indicated that hate crimes are more likely to involve physical violence resulting in injury—though research here has been less conclusive (see, for example, Cheng, Ickes, & Kenworthy, 2013; Corcoran et al., 2015).
Hate crimes are not only likely to “hurt more” than nonhate motivated crimes, but it is also often asserted that incidents will have similar impacts on other group (community) members (Iganski, 2001). A recent study by the Sussex Hate Crime Project found that hate crimes against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people and Muslim people not only traumatized direct victims but also had substantial negative impacts on other members of the victim’s group which were similar to those of direct victims (what the authors call “indirect hate crime”) (Brown & Walters, 2016). They reported that indirect victimization (in this case, personally knowing other victims of hate crime with similar identity characteristics) was clearly associated with different behavioral intentions (pro-action and avoidance)1 which were mediated by various emotional reactions (anger, anxiety, and shame; see also Bell & Perry, 2015; Perry & Alvi, 2012).
This growing body of work has provided important information on the emotional, behavioral, and spatial impacts of hate crime. However, the literature has tended to examine the impacts of hate crime on entire groups of people (such as Jewish or LGBT people). The homogenizing of victim groups means that differences and similarities that exist between members of those broad categories are yet to be comprehensively explored.2 In relation to anti-LGBT hate crime, trans3 victims have typically been subsumed into one single LGBT identity (Antjoule, 2016).4 Many studies on anti-LGBT hate crime have therefore failed to fully investigate the possible differences in impact between LGBT victims (Woods & Herman, 2014). The small number of studies that have focused solely on anti-trans hate crime suggest that trans people may be the most vulnerable of all victims of hate crime—both in terms of the disproportionate levels of violence experienced and the emotional and behavioral impacts caused by such incidents (Stotzer, 2009). There is also some evidence to show that trans people’s experiences of hate victimization is likely to be compounded by law enforcement agencies, with some studies suggesting that police officers regularly expose trans victims to direct and secondary victimization (Turner, Whittle, & Combs, 2009).
This article builds on this body of work by extrapolating data from the Sussex Hate Crime Project in the United Kingdom which looked at the direct and indirect impacts of anti-LGBT hate crime (see, Brown & Walters, 2016). Using quantitative survey data, we compare and contrast trans people’s direct and indirect experiences of hate crimes (using quantity and frequency), together with their emotional and behavioral reactions to an imagined hate crime scenario, with those of (non-trans) LGB people.5 We then examine trans people’s attitudes toward the criminal justice system, including respondents’ perceptions of the police, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), and the Government. These analyses have enabled us to provide a comprehensive assessment of trans people’s lived experiences and perceptions of individual, social, and structural prejudice.
Understanding Anti-Trans Hate Crime
Before examining the prevalence of hate crime among trans people, their emotional and behavioral responses to hate crimes, and their perceptions of the criminal justice system in the United Kingdom, it is important first to situate these findings within contemporary debates about the meaning of certain gender identities, expressions, and gender-based prejudices including “trans,” “transgender,” and “transphobia.” As Chakraborti and Garland (2015) note, the study of hate crime requires recognition of the complex relationships between gender, sex, and sexuality, acknowledging both the social (normative ideas and prescriptions) and individual-level (sense of self) factors and how these interrelate. To understand “trans” as an identity category and also transphobia and its permutation, anti-trans hate crime, it is important to distinguish between “sex” (biological characteristics acquired at birth) and “gender” (the social construction of femininity and masculinity and their attendant expectations and roles; Zucker & Bradley, 1995).
“Trans” identity refers to gender identities and expressions that go beyond biological sex as is assigned at birth. It is an inclusive term that embraces a broad range of identity categories and includes individuals who consider themselves transgender (those whose lifestyles appear to be in conflict with gender norms—for example, by dressing or presenting themselves in their preferred gender role); those who consider themselves not cisgender6 in any other way, rejecting binary categories—for example, genderfluid, nonbinary, genderfuck, genderless, agender, nongendered, third gender, two spirit, bigender, and trans man and trans woman (see, Jones, 2013; Turner et al., 2009); and transsexuals (those who experience a disjuncture between their gender identity and physical bodies, many of whom will wish to undergo surgery or hormone therapy to realign their bodies with their gender identity).7 More recently, the term “trans*” had been used to extend the inclusiveness of the term, the asterisk being a place holder for all suffixes of “trans” (Jones, 2013). However, the use of the asterisk has also come under some criticism for inferring that “trans” without the asterisk refers to a binary form of gender (e.g., trans man and trans woman) and has therefore fallen out of use by many lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, and intersex (LGBTQI) groups.8
Relevant to the theorization of trans identities is Butler’s (1990) work on gender as performative and distinct from physical bodies and binary classifications.9 Butler argues that gender roles and expectations surrounding gender expression are partly, or mostly, socially constructed and reconstructed through iterations of gender “performance” (Butler, 1990). West and Fenstermaker (1995) build upon this understanding of gender identity by arguing that the performance and re-performance of gender norms are reinforced through social and structural hierarchies that place masculinity as the “ideal” and femininity as “inferior” (see also Perry, 2001, chapter 4). Those who transgress the various socially prescribed versions of gender are perceived to be provoking disorder. In doing so, they can “challenge the ontology of gender and sex as norms . . . render[ing] the norms of sexual desire unintelligible” (Perry & Dyck, 2014b, p. 52).
It should be noted that the terms and definitions discussed here are constantly changing and thus are historically contingent. Authors have variously noted the fraught and contested nature of categories (e.g., Kuper, Nussbaum, & Mustanski, 2012; Levitt & Ippolito, 2014; Norton & Herek, 2013) such as medicine, social science, psychology, feminism, queer theory, and a more political trans community converge to theorize “trans.” In addition, inter-sectioning identities (see Warner, 2008) such as class, ethnicity, and sexuality can play an important role in trans people’s lives (Sevelius, 2013) as well as their experience of transphobia (Lombardi, 2009; Moran & Sharpe, 2004).10
Transphobia
Turner and colleagues (2009) define transphobia as “an irrational reaction to those who do not conform to the socio-cultural ideology of gender conformity” (p. 7). Perry and Dyck (2014b) explain that these “reactions” occur where people’s gender status directly challenges that of masculinity and of male sex (p. 52). In their “act” of transgressing binary gender identity, some individuals can threaten to eliminate socially prescribed gender norms entirely. This can give rise to negative attitudes such as hatred, loathing, rage, disgust, or moral indignations toward trans people on the basis of their gender enactments (Bettcher, 2007). Key here is the perception of threat that transgressing prescribed gender identities gives rise to. Social psychologists explain that those who challenge identity-based norms give rise to what is labeled “realistic” and “symbolic” threats toward entire groups of people (known as integrated threat theory, Stephan & Stephan, 2000). Realistic threats consist of tangible conflicts of interest—such as perceived competition over jobs, housing, and other resources between the ingroup and outgroups, whereas symbolic threats relate to people’s social identities, such as the ingroup’s “way of life,” including culturally important values and norms (see Brown, 2010, chapters 6 and 8).
While there is no social psychological empirical research on the link between these types of threat and transgender identity, theoretically at least it is likely that trans people give rise to a symbolic threat with regard to gender norms, which in turn elicit feelings of disgust and revulsion in some gender conforming individuals toward nongender conforming people (for a similar theoretical framework in relation to heterosexual people’s emotional reactions to gay people, see Cottrell & Neuberg, 2005). Importantly then, “phobia” in transphobia should not denote a disorder or refer to clinical phobic reactions, but should refer instead to social psychological reactions which are directly linked to cultural norms—at least in part. Perry (2001) claims that it is these cultural norms that foster and sustain social hierarchies that are based on a number of different identities. Dominant ideas about “ways of being” can become entrenched in social structures and processes, which in turn help to perpetuate dominant forms of gender identity (“doing gender”; Perry, 2001; West & Fenstermaker, 1995). Hill and Willoughby (2005) argue that central to explaining the threat of trans identity to society is the role of “genderism”—a cultural ideology “that reinforces the negative evaluation of gender non-conformity or an incongruence between sex and gender” by juxtaposing the gendered “other” (abnormal) with dominant cisgender (“normal”) people (p. 534). It is this social evaluation that fosters individual-level emotional disgust (a social psychological response), which in turn can result in “gender bashing” (i.e., anti-trans hate crime).11
Anti-Trans Hate Crime
It is only relatively recently that “gender identity” or “transgender identity” has been recognized as deserving of legislative protection under hate crime laws (Woods & Herman, 2014). In the United States, 19 states now cover gender identity within state hate crime laws. However, beyond the United States, few countries protect against anti-trans hate crime. Within the Organization for Security and Co-Operation in Europe (OSCE) region, only nine member states monitor this type of hate crime (Woods & Herman, 2014). In England and Wales, “transgender” was included as one of the five protected characteristics in hate crime legislation in 2012,12 though it was first included under the operational definition of hate crime (i.e., that used by the police when recording hate crimes) in 2001 as part of the definition of homophobic hate crime, and later as a separate type of hate crime (College of Policing, 2014; Giannasi, 2015).
Despite the inclusion of transgender within the hate crime policy domain in parts of the United States and now England and Wales, there is a paucity of research on this type of targeted violence (Chakraborti & Garland, 2015, chapter 5). Even the most recent analysis of hate crime data from the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW), a comprehensive victimization survey of 50,000 households, failed to examine the extent and nature of anti-trans hate crimes due to the fact that “the number of CSEW respondents who were victims of this type of hate crime was too low to provide a robust estimate” (Home Office, Office for National Statistics, and Ministry of Justice, 2013, p. 13). Official statistics on recorded hate crime provide a limited picture of the problem. The police in England and Wales recorded 858 anti-trans hate crimes between 2015-2016 (Corcoran & Smith, 2016), an increase of 272% since 2011-2012, while in the United States, recent FBI statistics revealed that just under 100 gender identity–based hate crimes were recorded by the police (“Latest Hate Crime Statistics Available,” 2015). Of course, these data are limited in that they rely on victims of anti-trans hate crime reporting incidents to the police, a problem we return to later. Indeed, while such figures are already cause for concern, the true extent of anti-trans hate crime is likely to be much greater.
The Nature and Extent of Anti-Trans Hate Crime: What We Know
Disproportionately high levels of targeted violence experienced by trans people has been reported by a number of other surveys. The most recent is the U.S. Transgender Survey of 28,000 transgender people, which found that 46% of respondents had been verbally harassed and one in 10 had been physically attacked during the past year because of being transgender (James et al., 2016; see also, Wilchins, Lombardi, Priesing, & Malouf, 1997). A European-based survey of over 6,500 trans people across Europe by the European Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) similarly found pervasive experiences of targeted abuse. They found that 34% of respondents had experienced violence or were threatened with violence in the 5 years preceding the survey, while 15% had experienced violence or had been threatened with violence in the 12 months preceding the survey (FRA, 2014; see also Turner et al., 2009).13
As with other research on hate crime (see Chakraborti, Garland, & Hardy, 2014), anti-trans abuse is likely to be repetitive in nature. This was illustrated by research conducted in Wales by Williams and Tregidga (2013),14 who found that 50% of transgender respondents to their hate crime survey had experienced repeat victimization. This finding was reaffirmed during qualitative interviews, with some participants revealing that they suffered from persistent daily abuse (Williams & Tregidga, 2013; see also Perry & Dyck, 2014b). Repeated verbal abuse can also frequently escalate into more violent incidents, with one survey by the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP) in the United States showing that transgender people were 1.58 times more likely to sustain an injury than non-trans victims of hate crime, suggesting that anti-trans hate crime can be particularly violent (NCAVP, 2012; see also FRA, 2014).
Studies have also shown that there are disproportionately high rates of sexual violence committed against trans people (Stotzer, 2009).15 One survey of 515 MTF and FTM16 trans people found that 59% had reported a history of forced rape or sexual assault (Clements-Nolle, Marx, & Katz, 2006; see also, James et al., 2016). Another study of the 350 trans participants found that 27% had been forced to engage in sexual activity, and 57% of these participants stated that at least one of these incidents was motivated by bias against their gender identity (Xavier, Honnold, & Bradford, 2007; see also Clements-Nolle et al., 2006; FRA, 2014; Xavier, Bobbin, Singer, & Budd, 2005).17
The Impacts of Hate Crime
Direct and indirect demonstrations of anti-trans hate are likely to give rise to perceptions of threat (both realistically and symbolically) among trans people. The perception of threat invariably gives rise to certain emotional reactions, an idea that is central to Intergroup Emotions Theory (e.g., Mackie & Smith, 2015). According to this theory, different types of threat provoke specific emotions which, in turn, give rise to certain behavioral intentions and responses (Mackie & Smith, 2015; see also Cottrell & Neuberg, 2005, for a similar analysis). In the case of hate crime directed at one’s group (community), the threat of violence (and other forms of targeted abuse) will most likely give rise to the emotions of anger and fear. These emotional reactions are then linked to pro-active actions (such as joining community groups) and avoidant action tendencies (such as staying indoors), respectively (Brown & Walters, 2016; Mackie & Smith, 2015).
Research conducted in the United Kingdom by Williams and Tregidga (2013) showed that those likely to suffer the most impacts of hate crime were transgender victims, with respondents experiencing heightened levels of anger, fear, depression, and a reduction in confidence.18 These negative emotions are likely to have significant behavioral and spatial consequences for trans individuals. For instance, Kenagy and Bostwick (2005) found that 56% of respondents stated that being transgender made them feel unsafe in public, while 43% stated that they felt uncomfortable in public. It is unsurprising, then, that many trans people attempt to conceal or change their gender identity and avoid public spaces to reduce the risk of hate crime victimization (see FRA, 2014; McNeil, Bailey, Ellis, Morton, & Regan, 2012; Perry & Dyck, 2014b; Williams & Tregidga, 2013).
With anti-trans hate crime commonly occurring in both public spaces and within the home by family members (FRA, 2014, p. 59; Kenagy & Bostwick, 2005), many trans people will be without a “safe space” where they can feel secure. Young trans people are especially susceptible to a lack of safe space as their gender is not only policed in public places by strangers but also in the home by their parents and other family members (Perry & Dyck, 2014b). This can lead to what Perry and Dyck (2014b) refer to as “hyper-vigilance” among trans individuals who are constantly aware of their surroundings and the potential for violence (p. 58).
The pervasiveness of transphobia often means that there are few people that victims of anti-trans violence can to turn to for support. The lack of social and emotional support often results in social isolation, leaving many individuals feeling ostracized and rejected by almost everyone in their lives. Perry and Dyck (2014b) note that social rejection can be internalized, resulting in individuals feeling a lack of confidence and love for oneself and worse still to hostility and self-loathing (see also Perez-Brumer, Hatzenbuehler, Oldenburg, & Bockting, 2015). So severe are these emotional impacts, that trans victims are at a much greater risk of suicidal ideation and/or attempted suicide than non-trans victims (Williams & Tregidga, 2013).19
Policing Anti-Trans Hate Crime
The everydayness of anti-trans abuse extends well beyond the familial and community-based prejudices that shape trans’ people’s day-to-day lives, permeating most social structures and institutions throughout society (Perry, 2001). One institution that has been shown to be particularly susceptible to proliferating rigid conceptions of gender identity is the police. Not only have the police represented male officers as traditionally masculine, powerful, and tough, but it has also, as an institution, been active in policing the gender of others. This has historically meant that cisgender women have been treated as “vulnerable” and “weak,” while men who fail to conform to the male masculine type have often been criminalized, brutalized, and violently disposed of (Burke, 1993; Moran & Sharpe, 2004). The gendered nature of policing has meant that most trans people are profoundly suspicious of police officers (FRA, 2014). Perry and Dyck (2014b), citing a participant in their study, state, [t]here tends to be a general consensus among the women we spoke to that “the law is not a friend to trans women, no part of, no interaction with the law on any level can be considered safe, it’s inherently dangerous.” (p. 56)
The issue here is one of institutionalized violence. Meyer (2014) argues that neither the law, nor hate crime legislation specifically, can protect trans people from violence because legal institutions are still “reinforcing existing power imbalances” (also cited by Perry & Dyck, 2014b, p. 56; see also Vipond, 2015).
The failure of trans people to perform gender “appropriately” has historically been viewed with suspicion by some police officers who have, in turn, questioned their validity as “real victims” (Moran & Sharpe, 2004, p. 408). Perceived transgressions of gender expression challenge the assumptions of some front-line officers about “appropriate conduct.” Moran and Sharpe (2004) argue that, as a consequence, some police officers categorize trans victims as “bad victims” (p. 408), resulting in them being treated disrespectfully and/or without the support they need in the aftermath of targeted victimization (see also Miles-Johnson, 2015a, 2015b). Turner and colleagues’ (2009) study support such an assertion, reporting that the majority of trans respondents in their survey of European countries stated that they were less likely to be confident that they would be treated by the police with dignity and respect as a trans person (see also FRA, 2014).20 Analysis of their qualitative data corroborated these findings, with interviewees noting that anti-trans violent incidents were not always taken seriously. It was also suggested by some interviewees that the police implicitly or explicitly asserted that the victim was the cause of the incident (see also FRA, 2014).
Further compounding their experiences of hate crime is the fact that trans victims are often misgendered by officers (Miles-Johnson, 2015b; Williams & Tregidga, 2013). Failure to address victims’ gender accurately is likely to result in secondary victimization, thereby compounding their experiences of gender-based subjugation (Miles-Johnson, 2015b). Worse still is the fact the police have, in the past, been accused of perpetrating hate-motivated violence against trans people. Testa and colleagues’ (2012) study in the United States found that eight respondents (out of 271) had been physically assaulted by a police officer, while five respondents stated that they had been the victim of a sexual assault by an officer (see also James et al., 2016; NCAVP, 2015).
Woods and Herman (2014) reflect that there is often little “pay-off” (p. 283) for trans communities in reporting incidents to the police, based on the fact that law enforcement agencies have become implicated in gender hierarchies which ultimately expose trans people to further emotional and social harms (see also Miles-Johnson, 2015b). As a result, the majority of trans victims of hate crime do not report incidents to the police (Testa et al., 201221; Williams & Tregidga, 2013).22
Despite these relatively negative views of the police, Williams and Tregidga’s (2013) survey showed that many trans people would still encourage a victim of hate crime to report it to the police. The reasons given for this was to ensure that incidents are recorded properly by statutory authorities so as to improve awareness of the problem. Furthermore, Williams and Tregidga found that contrary to other studies, transgender victims were more satisfied with police contact than other hate crime victims. Perry and Dyck (2014b) also note that trans people who participated in their study did not uniformly reject hate crime laws but rather they were critical of gender identity being excluded from such laws.
A tension clearly exists here between the structural resistance to non-conforming gender identities within institutions (such as the law and law enforcement agencies) and calls for greater recognition of transphobia and anti-trans hate crime by statutory agencies (Moran & Sharpe, 2004). This paradox reveals a complex dynamic within some communities whose members actively seek out protection by the state, but who are simultaneously aware that to do so may expose them to further forms of victimization. It is a dilemma that has beset many targeted minority communities, and it is one that only institutional and cultural transformation can prevent from (re)occurring (Macpherson, 1999; see “Policy Implications” section).
Method
To more fully understand trans people’s experiences of hate crimes, we surveyed 593 LGBT participants who live in United Kingdom. This online sample was recruited opportunistically with the help of several partner organizations who tweeted a link to the survey on Twitter and via advertisements on Facebook. Although not truly representative of the LGBT population in the United Kingdom, the diversity of groups and online sources used to recruit respondents means that it is likely to be a reasonable approximation. Surveys typically took between 15 and 20 min to complete and all survey results were collated over a 4-month period. Both experiences of direct hate crime (i.e., individual experiences of victimization) and indirect hate crime (i.e., knowledge of others known personally to the respondent who have been victimized) were studied.
Out of the 593 respondents surveyed, 59 participants identified as trans.23 Individuals included in our study as “trans” self-identified using the following gender identities: trans male, trans female; gender queer trans, gender queer trans male, gender queer trans female; nonbinary trans female; nonbinary trans male.24 Participant’s ages ranged from 18 to 67 with an average age of 35.45 years.25
The survey asked people to state whether they had experienced (directly and/or indirectly26) a number of different types of anti-LGBT hate crime and hate incidents (including both verbal and physical abuse). We then asked individuals to state the frequency of their experiences. We used a slightly amended version of the College of Policing’s (England and Wales) operational definition of anti-LGBT hate crime and hate incidents when explaining to respondents: Any criminal offence, or non-crime incident, which is perceived, by the victim or any other person, to be motivated by a hostility or prejudice based on a person’s sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation or trans identity or perceived trans identity. (College of Policing, 2014).
The survey then asked respondents to imagine that an anti-LGBT hate crime had been committed against someone in their local town (see “Emotional Reactions” section). This allowed us to ask a number of questions about respondents’ emotional reactions and behavioral intentions toward anti-LGBT hate crimes.27
Due to the size of the survey, we were able to compare the levels and frequency of (direct and indirect) victimization between lesbian, gay, and bisexual people who did not identify as trans with individuals who did identify as trans. Following on from this analysis, we then examined respondents’ emotional and behavioral intentions toward the imagined hate crime scenario across each group.28 Mediational analyses were used to assess the extent to which any differences in emotional and behavioral reactions between the two groups could be attributed to their indirect or direct experiences of hate crimes. Finally, the survey measured each groups’ attitudes toward the Government and criminal justice agencies, and how these attitudes were influenced by any prior contact with them.29
Note that all questions used the term anti-LGBT hate crime as against homophobic or anti-trans hate crime. This was to allow for simplicity in the survey, but it also reflects the fact that anti-LGBT hate crime can be intersectional, with trans people often experiencing homophobic as well as transphobic abuse for their perceived gender-based transgressions (Sevelius, 2013).30
Level and Frequency of Direct and Indirect Hate Crime Victimization
Table 1 reveals that, compared with non-trans LGB participants, trans people were significantly more likely to have been a direct victim of hate crime involving physical assaults, physical assaults with weapons, verbal abuse, and online abuse. For instance, we found that 29% of trans respondents had experienced a physical assault motivated by anti-LGBT hostility over the previous 3 years; this was more than twice the percentage reported by LGB respondents (12%). Trans people were also more likely to have indirect experiences with these types of hate crimes (Table 2). In other words, they were more likely to personally know other LGBT people who had been targeted because of their sexual orientation and/or transgender identity.

Not only were trans people more likely to experience verbal and physical hate crime (both directly and indirectly) overall, but they were also likely to experience incidents more frequently. The figures below show the frequency of verbal abuse and physical assaults experienced both directly and indirectly by trans participants and non-trans LGB participants.
Figures 1 to 3 show that, on average, trans people experienced direct and indirect anti-LGBT crimes more frequently than non-trans participants. For example, 54% of trans people reported more than three instances of direct verbal abuse in the past 3 years (Figure 3) and 13.5% reported more than three direct physical assaults (Figure 1). By comparison, 19.5% and 1.5% of non-trans participants experienced more than three instances of direct verbal abuse and direct physical assaults during the same period. Similarly, 71% of trans participants reported knowing more than three victims of verbal abuse and 17% knew more than three victims of physical assault, compared with 32% and 9% of non-trans participants, respectively.31

Reactions to Hate Crime
Emotional Reactions
As noted earlier, studies have shown that trans people’s experiences of hate crime are often marked by high levels of psychological trauma. To examine respondents’ emotional reactions of hate crime, we asked participants to “imagine that you find out that a LGBT person, who you did not personally know, was physically assaulted in an anti-LGBT hate crime in the town where you live.” Such a scenario ensured no extraneous variables concerning the hate crime (e.g., severity of crime, closeness to victim, etc.) could account for the difference in emotional reactions across participants. The scenario also allowed participants without any previous experience to be included in the sample. Both emotional reactions and behavioral intentions were measured using 1 to 7 scales (1 = do not agree at all, 7 = strongly agree).
As shown in Figure 4, we found that trans people experienced high levels of threat, vulnerability, and anxiety, which were slightly at higher levels than non-trans LGB people (though these differences were not statistically significant).32 Trans people also experienced high levels of anger; however, this was less than non-trans people (p < .05),33 though note that trans people still reported a great deal of anger toward hate crime (M = 5.86 vs. 6.14 on a 7-point scale). Finally, the results also showed that trans people experienced marginally less shame (p < .07) toward hate crimes than other LGB participants.
Figure 4.
Emotional reactions toward hate crimes.
The impacts of anti-LGBT hate crimes could be linked to trans people’s broader experiences of prejudice and “othering” in the society and within their family. Concurring with other studies outlined above, we found that trans respondents were less likely to report that they received family approval for being LGBT (trans = 3.83 vs. non-trans = 4.86, p < .001) and they were also less likely to feel supported by friends for being LGBT (trans = 5.71 vs. non-trans = 6.12 p < .05). More broadly, trans respondents felt that they received less societal approval for being LGBT (trans = 3.22 vs. non-trans = 4.13, p < .001). Further correlational analyses34 revealed that this perceived lack of support was, in part, associated with trans people’s greater number of prior experiences of anti-LGBT verbal abuse compared with non-trans participants (p < .01). This finding suggests that it is the persistence with which trans people experience hate-motivated verbal abuse that results in them feeling less supported by almost everyone around them (see also Perry & Dyck, 2014a). As we will see below, the lack of confidence in the police and the Government may further compound trans people’s feelings of isolation and societal rejection.
Behavioral Intentions
Still imagining the hate crime scenario, we asked participants how they thought they would react to hearing about the hate crime (Figure 5). It should be noted that behavioral intentions have been shown to be a significant predictor of actual behaviors (e.g., Theory of Planned Behavior, Ajzen, 1985; Armitage & Conner, 2001).
Figure 5.
Intended behavioral responses to hate crimes.
The study found that both trans and non-trans people were likely to engage in pro-action behaviors (e.g., join LGBT support groups and charities). Importantly, we found that both trans and non-trans individuals were unlikely to want to seek (violent) retaliation. Trans people, however, were marginally more likely to engage in avoidant behaviors, such as seeing friends less often and changing their appearance, than other LGBT participants (p < .06). Interestingly, correlational analyses revealed that this intention to avoid was a consequence of their greater number of direct experiences of both verbal and online hate crimes (p < .005 and p < .05, respectively).
Perceptions of the Criminal Justice System
As outlined at the start of this article, emotional and behavioral responses to hate crime are frequently compounded by those statutory agencies that are tasked with mitigating against these impacts. As such, this study explored the experiences and attitudinal responses of trans people toward the police, the CPS, and the Government in relation to anti-LGBT hate crime.
Police Effectiveness and Perceptions of Policies and Procedures
Proportionately, slightly more trans people (32%; n = 19) had contacted the police regarding a hate crime than non-trans people (27%; n = 140), though this difference was not significant. This is somewhat surprising, considering the distinct lack of confidence that trans people generally have in the police. One possible reason for this is that there were higher rates of more serious types of hate crime reported by trans people, which are more likely to come to the attention of the police via self-reporting or by witnesses reporting incidents.
In line with other studies reviewed above, we found that trans people were more likely to believe that the police are less effective at dealing with anti-LGBT hate crimes compared with non-trans participants (Figure 6, p < .005). Further analyses35 revealed that trans people who had contact with the police officers thought the police were less effective than non-trans people who had contact with them (M = 3.13 vs. 4.24, p < .001); there was little difference between the two groups when they had not had any contact with the police (3.8 vs. 4.1). This suggests that trans people have more negative experiences with the police compared with other victims of anti-LGB hate crime.
Figure 6.
Attitudes toward the criminal justice system.
Trans participants were slightly (and nonsignificantly) more likely to state that the police should have special policies and procedures for anti-LGBT hate crimes than non-trans participants. Again, this was qualified by the amount of contact they had had with the police, but this time, trans people who had had no contact with the police were more likely to believe that the police should have special policies and procedures (such as having specialist police officers) than non-trans participants who also had not had contact with the police (M = 5.52 vs. 4.98, p < .01). For those who had had contact with the police, the difference between the two groups was smaller, in the opposite direction, and nonsignificant (M = 5.2 and 5.5 for trans and non-trans, respectively). This provides further evidence (though by no means conclusive) that trans people are still not being provided with the support that they need from law enforcement agencies.
Contact and Attitudes Toward the CPS
A significantly higher proportion of trans people (15%; n = 9) had had experience with the prosecution service in England and Wales (CPS) in regard to a hate crime than had non-trans participants (7%; n = 36, p < .05).36 This again may indicate that trans people experience more serious/violent offenses than non-trans victims; that is, they experience those offenses which are more likely to result in a criminal prosecution.
The difference between the trans and non-trans group in their confidence in the CPS depended on whether or not they had had any contact with the CPS: those trans people who had had some contact with the CPS expressed higher confidence levels than the non-trans people who had had contact (3.7 vs. 3.1), though it is worth noting that this confidence level is still below the midpoint (4) and thus may still indicate a negative perception of the CPS. Conversely, when trans people did not have contact with the CPS, their attitudes toward the CPS were less favorable than non-trans people (who also had no contact with the CPS: M = 3.0 vs. 3.7; see Figure 7).37 This may indicate that direct engagement with the CPS improved trans people’s confidence in this institution and provided some evidence that this state agency may have slightly enhanced its responses to anti-trans hate crime.
Figure 7.
Confidence in the CPS depends on amount of contact with it.
Note. CPS = Crown Prosecution Service.
Attitudes Toward the Government
Finally, as shown in Figure 6, our research showed that trans participants believed the Government should do more to combat anti-LGBT hate crimes than non-trans participants (p < .005). As both trans and non-trans participants’ average responses are above the scale midpoint (4), this broader finding infers that all LGBT people, but especially trans individuals, feel the Government should be doing much more to tackle this issue.
Discussion
Our investigation into trans people’s experiences with hate crimes suggest that they are significantly more likely than non-trans LGB people to be direct victims of hate crime that involve physical assaults, physical assaults with weapons, verbal abuse, and online abuse. Most stark is the finding that trans respondents were more than twice as likely to have experienced a hate-motivated physical assault over the past 3 years than LGB respondents. Trans respondents were also more than twice as likely to have experienced more than three incidents of hate-motivated verbal abuse over the past 3 years, and 9 times as likely to have experienced three or more hate-motivated physical assaults over the past 3 years, compared with non-trans respondents.
Building on the current knowledge base on impacts of hate crime, we found that trans people are also likely to have extensive experience of indirect victimization. Indeed, respondents were significantly more likely than non-trans LGB people to have been an indirect victim of hate crime involving physical assaults, physical assaults with weapons, verbal abuse, and online abuse. This is the first quantitative study to reveal the extent to which trans people are affected, not only by direct victimization, but by incidents which occur across trans communities.
Compounding trans people’s experiences of hate crime was the fact that individuals did not feel as supported by family, friends, and society for being LGBT as non-trans individuals (see also Perry & Dyck, 2014b). Notably, respondents’ sense of lack of support was correlated with the frequency of the direct (verbal) abuse they had previously endured. This finding illustrates how trans people can become trapped within a pernicious cycle of persistent (verbal) anti-trans abuse, which in turn exacerbates their sense of cultural and societal isolation. Such a finding speaks to our earlier reference to Butler’s work, illustrating how trans people’s experiences of the world is shaped by their performance of gender, an enactment of identity that is verbally rejected and persistently vilified by other cisgender and/or non-trans people. This ongoing process of “othering” constructs trans identity as deviant, and in turn results in pervasive forms of abuse that ultimately leads to the social and structural rejection of trans people.
Trans people’s common experiences of hate crime, combined with their feelings of social rejection, means that most individuals are implicated in what can been termed an ongoing process of victimization. In addressing this problem, statutory agencies must do more to protect against anti-trans abuse if the state is to play a credible role in supporting the needs of trans communities. Of particular concern then was that within this study, trans peoples’ attitudes toward the criminal justice system were profoundly negative (see similarly, Miles-Johnson, 2015b; Moran & Sharpe, 2004; Williams & Tregidga, 2013). In general, respondents felt that the police are not effective at policing anti-LGBT hate crime, and they are not respectful toward them as victims; this was especially true where individuals had previous contact with the police. Respondents were also less confident in the CPS to prosecute anti-LGBT hate crimes, though the level of confidence was lower where respondents had not had direct experience with the CPS. Finally, respondents believed the Government should do more to combat anti-LGBT hate crimes.
Collectively, our findings support the assertion that trans people are faced with pervasive individual and systemic forms of genderism. The data provide cogent evidence of the various direct and indirect forms of victimization that are experienced as part of a continuum of individual, social, and structural prejudice. Hate incidents against trans people should, therefore, not be viewed as one-off or isolated incidents of prejudice that are committed by hardened bigots operating at the edge of society, but as part of a process of abuse that is symptomatic of a corrupted social milieu, that which sustains a cultural resistance against individuals who transgress gender norms. We see evidence of this, not just in the commonality of targeted anti-trans hatred but in the lack of familial and societal support experienced by trans people, as well as their distinct lack of confidence in the Government and its criminal justice apparatus to protect them. The result is that hate crime, and more broadly transphobia, continues to actively restrict trans people’s equal participation in a society where they are free from discrimination and targeted violence.
Limitations
We would have ideally liked to have explored any differences in impact based on respondents’ gender identity and gender expression within the sample. However, due to the smallish sample size and the fact that a total of seven self-identifying gender identities were included in the study, we were unable to provide any statistically significant data on differing impacts based on divergent gender identities within the sample. This was also true of differences based on ethnic background. As noted above, the vast majority of trans respondents to our survey described themselves as “White British.” This meant that we were unable to examine the effects that racial or ethnic differences had on individuals’ reactions to hate crime or their behavioral intentions. Moreover, the homogeneity in ethnic backgrounds meant that we were also unable to explore issues around intersectionality. This was unfortunate considering that there is some evidence within the literature to show that ethnicity and gender identity may have an intersectional effect on the nature and impact of anti-trans violence (Grant et al., 2011; NCAVP, 2015).
The lack of ethnic diversity in our sample was a product of the sampling technique that we employed to gain sufficient numbers in the study to make valid quantitative analyses. Respondents were recruited online via our partner organizations and social media outlets. This form of opportunity sampling meant that the sample would never be “truly” representative of the entire trans community. However, it only became clear after the study that such a process did not reach enough trans people from ethnic minority backgrounds. Hence, although we were able to disaggregate trans respondents from the “LGBT” sample, thereby providing us with a more nuanced picture of the impacts of anti-LGBT hate crime, we were still unable to fully explore the differences that may exist within the trans community itself.
Policy Implications
Our findings that trans people experience persistent forms of both direct and indirect hate crime illustrate that anti-trans hate crime is a serious health issue which must be prioritized by statutory agencies. A recent Parliamentary Inquiry and final report on Transgender Inequality in the United Kingdom recommends, “[t]he Government should introduce new hate-crime legislation which extends the existing provisions on aggravated offences and stirring up hatred so that they apply to all protected characteristics . . . ” (House of Commons, Women & Equalities Committee, 2016, para. 275).38 Our finding that anti-LGBT hate crime is disproportionately common among trans people is directly relevant to the U.K. Government’s current assessment of whether transgender should be included under sections 28-32 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and Part 3A of the Public Order Act 1986, adding further credence to the assertion that anti-trans hate speech and hate crime is a social problem that requires specific legislative action.39
As this study suggests, further government action is important to trans people. However, it will be essential that any new laws and government measures do not become another conduit through which the state and its apparatus become implicated in the oppression and “othering” of trans people. Indeed, our data show that experience of hate crimes and direct experience with the police reduce confidence in these institutions. Such a finding indicates one or more of the following:
That justice agencies are directly or indirectly perpetuating trans people’s sense of victimization.
That agencies are not doing enough to support victims of anti-trans hate crime.
That agencies need to communicate more effectively to trans communities about what they are currently doing to tackle anti-trans hate crimes.40
Given that trans people have largely negative experiences with some statutory agencies responsible for tackling hate crime, it is possible that widening hate crime laws to include transgender may expose trans victims to secondary victimization. Within the Australian context, Miles-Johnson notes that to improve police responses within trans communities, forces have implemented new strategies to enhance the operational responses to hate crime. However, as Miles-Johnson (2015a) highlights, policy documents can often reflect the “aspirations” of an organization and “not necessarily the practice of the officers” (p. 1). One problem that has been highlighted in relation to policing of anti-trans hate crime is that policy documents do not detail the multiple ways in which contact between the police and trans people may result in discrimination, misgendering, insensitivity in language, or inappropriate procedures. Without adequate education and training on trans issues and trans identities, the policing of anti-trans hate crime is likely to repeat many of the social harms already endured by trans people. In this regard, the Transgender Equality Report states, The [UK] Ministry of Justice must ensure that it consults fully with the trans community in developing the Government’s new hate-crime action plan, so that the proposals are well-targeted and likely to be effective in increasing levels of reporting. This plan must include mandatory national transphobic hate-crime training for police officers and the promotion of third-party reporting. (House of Commons, Women & Equalities Committee, 2016, para. 267)
If this is to be successful, the consultation process must engage fully with trans communities across the United Kingdom. Of particular importance is that justice agencies directly engage with trans communities with the following aims:
Improving awareness about the complexities of trans identities and gender expression, including appropriate language.
To better determine the needs of trans people who have been victimized.
To communicate (interactively) to trans communities that the police and other justice agencies are taking anti-trans hate crime seriously and that agencies are dedicated to offering support by trained officers.
To ensure that policing strategies and policies on hate crime are based on evidence relating to the nature, extent, and impacts of anti-trans hate and hostility.
Only where public institutions engage directly with trans communities that they are there to serve can they challenge the misconceptions and fears that professionals often have about trans people. A more detailed policy domain on supporting trans victims which outlines the varied needs of trans people is needed if the justice system is to offer a system that provides appropriate support to victims of anti-trans hate crime. As this study has shown, that support must be based on the knowledge that hate crimes against trans people are highly pervasive (directly and indirectly) and repetitive, and that such crimes can have significant impacts on the emotions, behaviors, and attitudes of trans people.
Notes
Declaration of Conflicting Interests The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.; Funding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by a research grant to Mark Walters and Rupert Brown from the Leverhulme Trust (UK).; 1. Proaction included participate in anti-hate crime groups; participate in lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) charities; and participate in LGBT advocacy groups. Avoidance included go out less often; see friends less often; avoid places and people; pay more attention when out; less inclined to tell people about sexuality; show less public affection to partner; and change appearance.; 2. For a comprehensive study of the impacts of hate crime, including multiple and intersecting identities, see, Chakraborti, Garland, and Hardy (2014).; 3. Trans and transgender will be defined below.; 4. The authors of this study do this in a previous study for the purposes of understanding “community impacts,” (Brown & Walters, 2016).; 5. We do not use the term cisgender to describe non-trans LGB people. This is because not all LGB respondents will have identified as cisgender (despite also not identifying as transgender) and as such we do not wish to impose this label on our participants.; 6. “Cisgender” has come to describe those whose gender identity matches their biological sex characteristics at birth (Perry & Dyck, 2014a).; 7. Note that sometimes transsexuals and nonbinary people may also identify as being “transgender” or simply “trans.”; 8. See, for example, http://www.transstudent.org/asterisk; 9. Though queer theory and feminism in some forms have questioned both transsexualism and transgenderedness because they have been read as reinforcing traditional gender stereotypes or for invading female spaces (see Chakraborti & Garland, 2015).; 10. Note that we are unable to make any statistically relevant analyses of differences between trans people’s experiences of hate crime based on race, ethnicity, age, or class. Larger surveys on trans victimization should pursue these further to examine the impacts of intersectionality.; 11. Underpinning this assertion is research by Norton and Herek (2013) who used data from a national probability sample of heterosexual adults and found negative attitudes toward transgender people were more likely to be associated with heterosexual men, endorsement of a standard gender binary, psychological authoritarianism, political conservatism, and lack of contact with sexual minorities.; 12. Added by the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, s. 65(9). Note that transgender is also included in Scottish hate crime laws under the Offences (Aggravation by Prejudice; Scotland) Act 2009, ss. 1 & 2, but not in Northern Ireland.; 13. Turner, Whittle, and Combs (2009, p. 1) survey of 2,669 trans people across the continent similarly found that 79% of trans people “had experienced some form of harassment in public ranging from transphobic comments to physical or sexual abuse” (see also Morton, 2008).; 14. The All Wales Hate Crime Project.; 15. Research also suggests that trans women of color are disproportionately affected by physical and sexual violence (Grant et al., 2011; National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs [NCAVP], 2015).; 16. Male to Female and Female to Male, respectively.; 17. It should be noted that both sexual violence and physical violence against trans people frequently occur in the familial context. Kenagy and Bostwick (2005) find that 66% of their respondents had experienced some form of violence within the home.; 18. Research conducted in Wales.; 19. Williams and Tregidga (2013) report that trans people were 10 times more likely to have suicidal thoughts than other hate crime victims. A study by Testa and colleagues (2012; the Virginia Transgender Health Study) found that out of the 271 trans people, they surveyed trans women who had experienced physical violence were significantly more likely to report a history of suicidal ideation and attempted suicide.; 20. European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA, 2014) found that over one third of respondents said they did not report an incident of violence or threat of violence to the police out of fear of a homophobic and/or transphobic reaction from the police.; 21. Testa and colleagues’ (2012) Virginia-based research found that just 10% of trans victims reported an incident to the police.; 22. Williams and Tregidga found that the three most common reasons why trans victims did not report incidents to the police are (a) the police would not have understood, (b) previous bad experience of the police, and (c) fear of retaliation by the offender(s.) Other victims have noted that they are fearful of secondary victimization if they report to the police (Xavier, Bobbin, Singer, & Budd, 2005).; 23. Although the statistics used have been rigorously evaluated and tested against stringent statistical methodologies, the smallish number of trans participants means that some of the data should be treated with caution.; 24. Note that while our study on anti-LGBT victimization included queer people and trans people, broadly defined, we did not survey anyone identifying as intersex. Some intersex individuals may also identify as being trans, but readers should bear in mind that these identities should not be conflated. Intersex people’s experiences of targeted victimization is an area in clear need of further research.; 25. The sample was predominantly White British, with only one Asian and one mixed ethnicity participant; four respondents’ ethnicity was not determinable (e.g., “declined to answer”).; 26. Indirect victimization was defined as the respondent “personally knowing” someone in their local community who had been targeted.; 27. Note that we did not measure respondents’ emotional and behavioral reactions to their actually experienced hate crime for three reasons. The first is that lack of temporality in many cases may affect individuals’ memories of the actual impact of an incident. The second is that the use of scenario ensured no extraneous variables concerning the hate crime (e.g., severity of crime, closeness to victim, etc.) could account for the difference in emotional reactions across participants. Third, as part of the wider study, we compare the indirect effects of hate crimes on those with no previous experiences of hate crime to explore whether these previous experiences affect individuals’ emotions and their behavioral intentions. This would not have been possible were we to measure only the emotions of those who had experienced an actual hate crime.; 28. Note that trans people may have identified as any type of sexual orientation. Note also that LGB people may not necessarily identify as cisgender with some identifying as “queer” or “other.”; 29. As we contend that contact with the criminal justice agencies is predictive of attitudes toward them, we tested this moderation effect. Unfortunately, due to the small sample size, this precluded any further analysis into the mediational effects of indirect and direct experiences with hate crimes on these attitudes.; 30. This does, however, mean that it is possible that some trans people may have experienced anti-LGB hate crime as against anti-trans hate crime. Whether this is the case or not, the importance of the data is in measuring individual’s reactions to being targeted for hate crime and not the types of prejudices which give rise to such targeted abuse.; 31. Data for more than seven instances/victims: Percentage of people with seven or more direct experiences with verbal hate crimes: trans people 39% vs. non-trans 11%. Percentage of people with seven or more direct experiences with assault hate crimes: trans 1.7% vs. non-trans 0.4%. Percentage of people with seven or more indirect experiences with verbal hate crimes: trans 47.5% vs. non-trans 15%. Percentage of people with seven or more indirect experiences with assault hate crimes: trans 8.5% vs. non-trans 4%.; 32. See also Chakraborti, Garland, and Hardy (2014) and Williams and Tregidga (2013).; 33. All differences between the trans and non-trans groups reported here and below were examined using an independent-group t test.; 34. Bootstrap mediational analyses were conducted using the Process macro (Hayes, 2013). This analysis statistically assesses how one variable impacts upon another via a particular mechanism; for example, our analyses show that trans people feel less approval than non-trans participants, and they do so, in part, because they experience more verbal abuse.; 35. This analysis and the one reported immediately below used a two-way ANOVA with trans versus non-trans as one factor, and presence vs. absence of contact with police as the other.; 36. Established by χ2 test.; 37. This analysis was performed using a two-way ANOVA.; 38. Note that some of the findings from this article were presented to the Committee during the inquiry.; 39. U.K. hate crime provisions that currently do not include transgender as a protected characteristic.; 40. This may be particularly important to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) as direct experience did not reduce confidence.

Police say the suspect is a light-skinned woman in her 40s and appears to have a foreign accent
The New York City jogger who was attacked by a 'Karen' who threw a glass bottle at her and called her the n-word says she was the victim of a hate crime and is demanding justice. 
Tiffany Johnson, 37, was on a run at 53rd Place and Broadway in Woodside, Queens around noon on August 17 when she passed a corner and a woman threw a glass bottle at her feet unprovoked.
The woman shouted, 'Get out of here n*****, go back to Africa,' according to video release by the NYPD on Wednesday.
'It's a hate crime. It's not acceptable. She has to be [held] responsible for her behavior,' Johnson said to the New York Post.
Johnson revealed she thought the woman had mistaken her for someone else, and didn't initially think the attack was racially motivated.
But once the woman started to scream hateful insults at her, she realized it was because she is black.
'She could see the color of my skin and she reacted to that,' Johnson said.
'I was definitely shocked. I was surprised but more importantly I wanted to get away from her,' she added.
In the clip Johnson is seen turning back confused and saying 'What is your problem?' when the woman berates her and then continues her run.
'I'm entitled to go for a job, live my life, enjoy my life and enjoy the things that makes me happy,' she said.
Johnson said she took the route of being the bigger person and leaving rather than arguing with the woman.
'That's not on me. That's a reflection on her. She needs to look at herself and figure out why she looks down on somebody,' she said.
'We are always trying to give reasons for what people do but I can't get into her head. I only know what she did, what she said and her actions,' she added.
Johnson revealed she is happy police are on the hunt for her attacker - a woman described as light-skinned in her 40s who appears to have a foreign accent.
She is described as 5'5"", has blue eyes, long blonde hair and was wearing a black tank top, white shorts, and dark sunglasses.
'I'm glad the video surfaced so, hopefully, she won't do this to someone else. People shouldn't have to deal with that type of behavior,' Johnson said.
'I refused to and that's why I walked away - nope, nope!' she added. 
Johnson did not report the incident at the time until a friend saw the witness video on social media. 
She told ABC7 she has not gone back to that neighborhood since the incident, but has received an outpouring of support from groups like Black Girls Run.

In response to recent viral videos showing white people calling the police on Black people who aren t committing a crime, a California lawmaker on Thursday announced he will introduce a bill that would make it a hate crime to make discriminatory 911 calls.
KEY FACTS
Thebill, which will be introduced by California Assemblymember Rob Bonta, would add making a false emergency report to the state s hate crimes statute, meaning that 911 calls motivated by someone s race, religion, gender or any other protected class would qualify as a hate crime.
In a statement, Bonta said the intent isn t to discourage legitimate 911 calls from people who are facing real danger or reporting a crime in good faith. 
Instead, the statement says, the bill is meant to prevent the weaponization of our law enforcement against communities of color, adding that racist 911 calls are dangerous, demeaning and demoralizing to the person falsely accused. 
Bonta toldForbesthe maximum sentence could result in three years of prison time and will allow victims of discriminatory 911 calls to sue and ask for damages.
New York lawmakers are debating similar legislation afterAmy Cooperwent viral earlier this month for calling the police on a Black man who asked her to keep her dog leashed in Central Park.
Crucial quote
 If you are afraid of a black family barbecuing in the community park, a man dancing and doing his normal exercise routine in the bike lane, or someone who asks you to comply with dog leash laws in a park, and your immediate response is to call the police, the real problem is with your own personal prejudice, Bonta said in a statement.
Key background
Over the past year, several viral videos of white people calling the police to report Black people engaging in everyday activities have spread on social media and many of them have taken place in the Bay Area, the region Bonta represents. The first major viral video depicting this occurred in Oakland, California where a white woman called the police because she was scared of a Black family barbecuing, earning her the moniker BBQ Becky. Later that year in San Francisco, Alison Ettel, who is white, called the police on an 8-year-old girl who was selling water on the sidewalk without a permit. And more recently, a white couple went viral this week for callingthe neighborhood police watch on a Filipino-American neighbor for writing Black Lives Matter in chalk in front of his house while demanding to know if he actually lived there.

A man who was placed in a chokehold by a cop on a Queens boardwalk June 21 was arrested himself on Tuesday in The Bronx - charged with a hate crime after he allegedly harassed two gay men, hurling anti-gay slurs at them as he tried to steal their Louis Vuitton bag with a box cutter, police sources told DailyMail.com.
Ricky Bellevue, 35, and another man allegedly approached a gay couple, aged 27 and 30, on the sidewalk at East 149th Street and 3rd Avenue in the South Bronx at about noon on Tuesday, sources said.
Bellevue followed the couple up the street, while calling them 'fa**ot' and 'Ba**man,' a Jamaican slur for gay man. He then brandished a box cutter and tried to grab one of their designer bags. The men resisted, and a fight broke out.
The 27-year-old man was cut in the face and both hands with Bellevue's box cutter and treated for minor injuries. 
Bellevue was charged with robbery as a hate crime, a felony. He was taken to Lincoln Hospital, where he was put on suicide watch, a source said. 
Just two weeks ago the New York Police Department suspended the officer for slamming a Bellevue to the ground and putting him in a chokehold - eight days after Governor Andrew Cuomo banned the tactic.
 Bellevue, was standing with two white men on the boardwalk at Rockaway Beach at 8.45am last month.
The two white men were filming the officers, jeering at them and encircling them.
When Bellevue gets close to the officer, bodycamera footage shows him being flung to the floor.
In his left hand he held a white plastic bag, but a policeman said he grabbed something, perhaps with his right hand, and approached the officers. The footage is unclear.
Bellevue then tells a cop: 'You scared, you scared?'
As he approaches the officer, one of the white men turns to Bellevue and says: 'Yo, n***** what the f***?' 
One of the belligerent men tries to hold Bellevue back, but the officer lunges forward and grabs him, taking him down. A scuffle then ensues. 
Photos from the scene appear to show Bellevue being held in a chokehold.
As four uniformed officers restrained the man - who was face-down on the ground - a bystander yelled: 'Yo, he's choking 'em, let 'em go!' 
Dermot Shea, commissioner of NYPD, said the officer involved had been suspended.
'Accountability in policing is essential,' he said. 
'After a swift investigation by the Internal Affairs Bureau, a police officer involved in a disturbing apparent chokehold incident in Queens has been suspended without pay.
'While a full investigation is still underway, there is no question in my mind that this immediate action is necessary.
'We are committed to transparency as this process continues.'
The New York Daily News named the suspended officer as David Afanador. 
Bellevue, who lives with his twin brother in Rockaway, is overheard telling the officers he is bipolar and asthmatic. 
'This is what you do to a black man on Father's Day?' he says after he is led to an ambulance. 
'This is what you do in America? I'm born in America. 
'You're not here to help us. You're here to kill us. I always get beat up by the police.'
Standing by an EMT vehicle, he complains about his neck. 
'Sir, there is no pressure on your neck,' one officer is overheard saying. 
Bellevue keeps on repeating that he is asthmatic.
A person says: 'Sir, I am EMS, do you mind if I take a look at your lungs?'
He replies: 'Get the f*** away from me. You put me on my head. You smacked me, n*****.'
The officer tells him he needs to stop spitting.
'I'm going to sue y'all,' he says. 'I want all your badges.' 
While he is being looked at by the EMT, a woman yells: 'Do you not see that they are mentally ill, as well as he is? This is foolish.'
An officer approaches him and says: 'Ma'am. They were all acting crazy, right.'
She replies: 'So how are they not all being detained?'
He says: 'Let me finish. They are all obviously intoxicated. We know he has a mental history, past. We know he's bipolar. They were all talking all types of crazy stuff to us, we did nothing, I don't care - anybody can say whatever they want to us.
'What changed everything is when he grabbed something and squared up and was going to hit my officer, who's standing over there. That's when everything changed.
'The minute I saw him flex on him, that's when he goes down. Because we don't get hurt and we're not going to leave somebody violent out here who might do that to one of you, or another innocent person.
'And that's why he's in cuffs, and why he's going to the hospital, because we know he's ill.
'The other two were being loud, aggressive, and we don't like the way they are acting. But they are not acting like they were going to hurt anybody. 
She suggests that he was arrested for calling the officers 'a white piece of s***.' 
He continues: 'If we arrested every person who called me a white piece of s*** I'd have to lock up half the beach. 
'Somebody who is not being violent, we'll allow you to have your First Amendment rights and go home. 
'Somebody who acts differently towards us or the public, that's it and we'll have to take you into custody.' 
Bellevue's lawyer, Lori Zeno of the Queens Defenders, said recovered at Jamaica Hospital.
'I want the officer who put him in a chokehold to be in the cell next to him,' she said at the time. 'This guy should be charged criminally, and fired.' 
Mayor de Blasio called the video 'very concerning.'
'We're glad the NYPD is immediately launching an investigation to get to the bottom of what happened,' the mayor said.
Letitia James, the New York attorney general, said individuals who use chokeholds could be found guilty of a C felony.
'It is a very troubling video,' she said.
She said people had gathered in front of the 100th Precinct to 'demand justice and accountability'. "

Results are discussed in relation to hate crimes definitions and attribution theory. hate crimes sexual orientation attribution of blame jury decision making Recent literature features increased attention to the psychological aspects of sexual orientation–based hate crimes, in part due to media publicizing and scientists’ empirical attention. For example, Craig (2002) proffered a thorough overview of aggression as it relates to hate crimes. Craig argued that hate crime aggression is a specific type of aggression that represents underlying prejudice and serves an instrumental end. In addition, Cowan, Authors’ Note: Please address correspondence concerning this article to Robert J. Cramer, University of Alabama, Box 870348, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487; e-mail: Crame001@crimson. ua.edu 849 Heiple, Marquez, Khatchadourian, and McNevin (2005) demonstrated that old-fashioned heterosexism (vs. modern) was predictive of perceptions of hate crimes. This increased attention seems warranted given the high fre- quency of hate crimes in recent years. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reported a total of 8,380 hate crime offenses in 2005, 1,171 of which were due to sexual orientation (FBI, 2005). FBI statistics likely reflect an underestimate as most hate crimes go unreported (Herek, 2000). From a legislative standpoint, many jurisdictions consider hate-based crimes as an aggravating circumstance. However, as of 2002, eight states still did not include sexual orientation in their definition of hate crimes (Boeckmann & Turpin-Petrosino, 2002). Moreover, the controversy over sexual orientation’s inclusion in the legal definition of a hate crime extends to the federal level. As recently as May of 2007, the House of Representatives affirmed legislation including gender, gender identity, and sexual orienta- tion in the definition of a hate crime (Stout, 2007). If jurors are to follow existing state guidelines, perpetrators of hate crimes would receive harsher penalties compared to those not convicted of hate crimes. The present study assesses whether mock jurors intuitively assign harsher sentences to perpe- trators of hate crimes. Given the expectation that mock jurors will assign more severe sentences, the present study also tests attribution of blame as a potential explanation of juror perceptions of hate crimes. Attribution Theory: Definition, Types, and Construct Relations A large degree of empirical attention focuses on understanding mecha- nisms underlying perceptions of victims. Attribution of blame is one plau- sible explanation. Generally speaking, attribution theory holds that person-related and societal influences tend to shape attributions, which may in turn result in varying levels of blame for individuals who are in the same or similar situations (Catell, 1982; Howard, 1984). Although the accuracy of perceptions and details pertaining to situational facets are important, the present study focuses on the impact of perceptions of a particular trait, namely, sexual orientation of hate crime victims and perpetrators. Blame is one common attribution extensively examined in the social psychological literature. In particular, Shaver’s (1985) blame attribution model proposes that the construct is assigned in a three-step process. In short, a perceiver assesses the cause of an event, evaluates moral responsi- bility, and, as a result, arrives at a determination of blame (Shaver & Drown, 1986). According to this perspective, moral responsibility is vital as it is subsumed within the process of blame attribution. Also of note, 850 although both blame and moral responsibility are fluctuating continuums, moral responsibility differs from blame in that it results from understanding causality, intent, and awareness of the consequences of an event. Similarly, Mikula (2003) maintained that assignment of blame (resulting from the determination of responsibility) required moral value judgments and formed the basis for perceptions of injustices. Although these models hold that there is a clear relation between moral responsibility and blame, there is a dissenting perspective that indicates that responsibility and blame are more distinct (Bell, 1989; Brems & Wagner, 1994). Specifically, based on empirical findings of perceiver ratings of negligent actions, the authors concluded that moral responsibility is likely not evaluated in the process of assigning blame and that responsibility is in fact a more complex process. When the discussion is extended to responsi- bility in general, the link to assignment of blame becomes more obfuscated. Indeed, Robbennolt (2000) reviewed previous research and reported meta- analytic data suggesting that blame involves a moral judgment, whereas responsibility merely involves understanding a causal link between one’s behavior and its results. Moreover, statistical analyses showed that blame and responsibility differentially relate to the severity of actions preceding such determinations. What is clear from the blame-responsibility literature is a consensus that the two constructs are related. Theoretical and empirical work, however, show that blame and responsibility differ in relation to underlying causal mechanisms/hierarchical structure, linkage to morality, and association with severity of preceding events. The blame-responsibility distinction becomes important when identifying specific explanatory pathways to jury decision making and perceptions of hate crimes. Rayburn, Mendoza, and Davison, (2003) utilized a conception of blame based in the belief of a just world. The authors suggested that blame is not equivalent to responsibility, but rather, they use it synonymously with fault or culpability. This study served as a primary basis for the present investi- gation because blame attribution proved to be a valuable dependent mea- sure in sexual orientation–based hate crimes. The present investigation extends this literature by evaluating blame as an explanation of jury deci- sion making. Victim blame, a type of blame attribution, is often used as a dependent measure in victimology research (e.g., Bell, Kuriloff, & Lottes, 1994; Brems & Wagner, 1994; Davies, Pollard, & Archer, 2006; Fox & Leicht, 2005; Hirschberger, 2006; Howard, 1984; Rayburn et al., 2003). Related to sexual orientation, Davies and colleagues (2006) reported that male participants rated the male victim more blameworthy when the sexual assault was committed by a same-sex (male) perpetrator. Rayburn et al. 851 (2003) provided additional contributions to perceptions of hate crimes by reporting that bystanders blamed victims of hate crimes less and viewed perpetrators of hate crimes as more blameworthy than in nonhate crimes. These findings imply that perceptions of hate crimes victims may be more favorable because the perpetrator and victim differ in sexual orientation, potentially resulting in harsher outcomes for the perpetrator. Blame attribution likely plays a mitigating role in decision making related to crime victims and perpetrators, though there is a paucity of research investigating this pathway (e.g., Bradfield & Aquino, 1999). Osofsky, Bandura, and Zimbardo (2005) included a type of blame attribu- tion in their study of individuals with varying roles in the execution of death-row inmates. Operating from a moral disengagement perspective (Bandura, 1999, 2002), Osofsky and colleagues (2005) explored various cognitive mechanisms of justifying execution, including distancing of per- sonal responsibility and attributing blame to the perpetrator. Members of execution teams demonstrated exceedingly high degrees of both facets of moral disengagement. Bandura (2002) explicated such findings by propos- ing that people like executioners are able to carry out otherwise morally deplorable acts by blaming others such as authorities (e.g., judges, existing law) or the individual on the receiving end. Although blaming the death- row inmate for his or her situation (i.e., execution) may be beneficial in helping a correctional officer to complete his job in the execution process, it is also possible that blaming the perpetrator for his criminal behavior may assist jurors in their decision to assign the death penalty. Therefore, this study seeks to examine the role of blame attribution on severity ratings of sentencing within the context of jury decision making. Germane to the present investigation is a study by Rye, Greatrix, and Enright (2006) examining just world beliefs and attribution theory as they relate to victim and perpetrator gender. The authors reported an interaction in which female victims were viewed more favorably and their attackers treated more severely. In addition, male crime victims of male perpetrators were blamed the most compared to male victims of female perpetrators and female victims of female perpetrators. This finding suggests the possibility of bias against perpetrators of same-sex crimes. The authors also concluded that attribution of blame is associated with jury sentencing, whereas just world beliefs were uncorrelated. The Present Study Based on extant literature, the first goal of the present investigation was to clarify whether mock jurors assign harsher penalties to hate crime perpetrators 852 compared to perpetrators of nonhate crimes. This was accomplished by comparing two conditions in Study 1: a hate crime and a control crime without hate-motivation. In Study 2, hate crime perpetration was compared with three other conditions incorporating same-sex and opposite-sex vic- tims and perpetrators. Hate-motivation was not stated in the other three conditions. The crime in both studies was capital murder. The second goal of the present study was to clarify how blame attribu- tion affects mock juror decisions in hate crimes. In Study 1, this end was achieved by testing victim blame as a moderator of sentencing outcome between a hate crime and a control condition. Perpetrator sexual orientation was added in Study 2 in part to gain a comprehensive view of how blame attribution functions in this context. Many studies include perpetrator blame, and we viewed it as a sensible extension to promote further under- standing of attribution theory and hate crimes. Study 1 Hypotheses Hypothesis 1: Mock jurors will assign increased sentences for perpetrators in the hate crime condition when compared to the control condition. Hypothesis 2: Victim blame will moderate the above relation (no predicted direction). Method Participants A 10-point Likert-type item was included in the demographic question- naire to control for attitude toward the death penalty. This was used to assess the difference between death-qualified jurors (DQs) and death- excluded jurors (DEs) as is required by law (Witherspoon v. Illinois) in capital murder cases. In the United States legal system, death-qualification is a process wherein potential jury members are screened to determine whether or not they are able to assign the death penalty despite conflicting personal beliefs. Therefore, all potential participants were screened for death-qualification to remain consistent with actual trial procedure. As a result, approximately 10% of the original sample who adamantly opposed the death penalty (DEs) was eliminated from the analyses to reflect exter- nally valid jurors in capital murder trials. 853 Two hundred four death-qualified introductory psychology undergradu- ates from two public universities took part in this study (65 males, 139 females; M age = 19.36 years). Ethnicity was primarily White (n = 136) with other categories of African American (n = 17), Asian American (n = 18), Latin American (n = 8), Native American (n = 4), and Biracial or Other (n = 21). Religion was mostly Protestant (n = 83) and Catholic (n = 51), but others reported as Jewish (n = 2), Muslim (n = 11), Other (n = 39), and None (n = 17). One person failed to identify his religion. There were 104 participants in the control condition and 100 participants in the hate crime condition. Measures Script manipulation: Victim sexual orientation. Each of the two one- page vignettes contained identical summary information of a hate crime scenario in which a male perpetrator was convicted of the capital murder of a male coworker. Each vignette contained a paragraph of abbreviated jury instructions followed by logistical details and motivation for the crime. Specifically, information held constant between vignettes included time, date, and location (the victim’s residence); lack of conflict history between the two men; and a lack of criminal history on the part of the perpetrator. The manipulation concerned the motivation for the crime. One vignette served as the control condition with no stated victim sexual orientation; the other vignette contained the victim’s sexual orientation. The latter condi- tion, also referred to as the hate crime condition, included an additional statement that the perpetrator provided testimony about his rationale for the crime, which was his rage over the victim’s gay sexual orientation. Demographics. Participants completed a demographic form requesting their age, sex, race, religion, crime victimization history, and support for the death penalty. Death penalty support was measured on a 10-point Likert- type scale; higher scores reflected increased support for the death penalty. Victim blame. Victim Blame was assessed with the Victim Blame Scale (Rayburn et al., 2003). Participants were instructed to rate the victim on a list of 14 bipolar adjectives, each scored on a 7-point scale (1 to 7) that was totaled for a composite victim blame score. Five items were reverse scored. Example items included malicious-kind and blameless-blameworthy, and higher scores reflected elevated levels of victim blame. Rayburn and col- leagues (2003) reported an internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha) of .90. 854 Sentencing recommendation. Sentencing recommendation was defined as the likelihood of assigning the death penalty. Participants were instructed to rate the probability that they would assign the death penalty on a 10-point Likert-type scale. Scores ranged from 1 (Not at all likely) to 10 (Definitely likely). Procedure Participants received a randomly assigned, counterbalanced packet of questionnaires and a case vignette as described above. They underwent standard consent procedures which notified participants of anonymity, con- fidentiality, and the right to withdraw. Debriefing consisted of a summary form of the study purpose and description. Results Data were analyzed to assess two questions. First, we assessed whether the hate crime condition resulted in an increased likelihood of assigning the death penalty compared to the control condition. Second, we assessed victim blame as a moderator of this relation. Juror sex and support for the death penalty were control variables, and only participants who met Witherspoon death-qualification criteria were used. A between-subjects t test was used to assess the difference between the control condition and the hate crime condition on sentencing recommen- dation. There was a significant between-subjects effect, t(194) = –3.51, p ~ .001. Investigation of the means revealed that individuals in the hate crime condition were significantly more likely to assign the death penalty (M = 6.69, SD = 2.50) than those in the control condition (M = 5.39, SD = 2.67), Cohen’s d = .50. Moderation analyses were conducted following steps outlined by West, Aiken, and Krull (1996). Simple effects tests were used to follow up a sig- nificant moderation. To conduct simple effects tests, the sample was split into three groups representing the lower, middle, and upper thirds of victim blame level. The moderation analysis was significant, ΔF(1, 187) = 4.22, p .05, ΔR2 = .014. The test was significant at low values of victim blame, F(1, 187) = 4.23, p = .05. However, the test was not significant at moderate or high levels of victim blame. Jurors with low levels of victim blame were significantly more likely to assign the death penalty in the hate crime condi- tion (M = 7.56, SD = 2.21) than in the control condition (M = 6.22, SD = 3.02), 855 Figure 1 Likelihood of Assigning the Death Penalty by Level of Victim Blame Cohen’s d = .50. This effect is shown in Figure 1. Results suggest that evidence of a hate crime were viewed as an aggravating factor by jurors who blamed the victim the least. Discussion The hypothesis that hate crime perpetrators would be treated more puni- tively than those in a control condition was supported. Previous findings (e.g., Davies et al., 2006; Rayburn et al., 2003) demonstrated unequivocal negative perceptions of hate crime perpetrators compared to hate crime victims and perpetrators of other crimes. Support of this hypothesis extends the literature because life and death decision making appears to be affected by hate- motivated crimes. Although most studies look only at blame as an outcome 856 variable, we investigated its impact as a moderator. We found that under cer- tain circumstances, level of victim blame changes the juror decision- making process. Indeed, this is a finding worthy of further consideration. Present findings are in line with other studies showing attribution of blame as an explanation for behavior and decision making (e.g., Bradfield & Aquino, 1999; Osofsky et al., 2005). Extension of attribution theory to jury decision making appears to demonstrate that positive perceptions (i.e., low blame, high empathy) toward the victim yield harsher sanctions for the perpetrator. However, absence of negative perceptions, or an overt reason for the increased punishment, is still lacking based only on Study 1. Study 2 was designed to elaborate on these findings. Two significant alterations were made to further investigate potential differential sanctions for perpetrators of various types of crimes. Likelihood of assigning the death penalty was compared among four conditions, each containing information about victim and perpetrator sexual orientation. In this way, hate crime per- petrators would be compared to perpetrators of capital murder in three other scenarios in an attempt to replicate and extend the first hypothesis from Study 1. Moreover, perpetrator sexual orientation was added to assess if per- petrator blame affected decision making or affected the role of victim blame. Study 2 Hypotheses Hypothesis 1: Mock jurors will assign increased sentences for perpetrators in the hate crime condition when compared to all other conditions. Hypothesis 2: Victim blame will moderate the relation between crime condition and sentencing outcome (no predicted direction). Hypothesis 3: Perpetrator blame will moderate the relation between crime condition and sentencing outcome (no predicted direction). Method Participants The same death-qualification procedure was used in Study 2, and as in Study 1, approximately 10% of the sample was excluded. Participants were 140 death-qualified introductory psychology students (73 males, 67 females, mean age of 19.31 years) from a large public university in the southeastern United States. Participants were primarily White (n = 114), with other races 857 reported as African American (n = 18), Asian American (n = 3), Native American (n = 2), Biracial (n = 2), and Other (n = 1). Religion was reported as follows: Protestant (n = 54), Catholic (n = 20), Jewish (n = 2), Other (n = 51), None (n = 11), Multireligious (n = 1), and no response (n = 1). It should be noted that the majority of “Other” participants were in fact of varying Protestant denominations (e.g., Southern Baptist). Although we could have recategorized this data, we elected not to, to accurately respect and portray the distinctions drawn by individuals in defining their religios- ity. There were 37 participants in the same-sex heterosexual condition, 25 in the same-sex homosexual condition, 45 in the gay perpetrator–heterosexual victim condition, and 33 in the hate crime condition. Measures Script manipulation: Perpetrator and victim sexual orientation. Four different vignettes containing identical basic information from Study 1 were used; however, the experimental manipulations of perpetrator and victim sexual orientation were used. We added perpetrator sexual orienta- tion to see how it affected attribution of blame in addition to victim sexual orientation. The four conditions in Study 2 were as follows: (a) gay perpetrator/ gay victim (same-sex gay condition), (b) gay perpetrator/heterosexual victim (gay-heterosexual condition), (c) heterosexual perpetrator/heterosexual victim (same-sex heterosexual condition), and (d) heterosexual perpetrator/gay victim (hate crime condition). As in Study 1, the hate crime condition contained an additional statement that the perpetrator provided testimony about his rationale for the crime, which was his rage over the victim’s sexual orientation. The demographics, victim blame, and sentencing outcome measures were the same forms as in Study 1. Perpetrator blame. Instructions from the Victim Blame Scale (Rayburn et al., 2003) were altered to direct the participant to rate the perpetrator on the same list of adjectives as the victim. Social desirability. Given the politically sensitive nature of the topic of hate crimes, we wanted to control for socially desirable responding. This was accomplished by using the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (MCSDS; Crowne & Marlowe, 1960). The scale consists of 33 true/ false items, 15 of which are reverse scored. All positive responses to items are totaled for a composite social desirability score. In a summary of the 858 MCSDS, Paulhus (1991) reported average scores ranging from 13.3 (SD = 4.3) to 16.4 (SD = 6.5), as well as Cronbach’s alpha levels from .73 to .88. Procedure Participants received and completed a randomly assigned, counterbal- anced packet of questionnaires and a case vignette depicting one of the above conditions. Identical consent and debriefing procedures were admin- istered as in Study 1. Results Data were analyzed to assess two questions. First, we assessed whether the hate crime condition resulted in increased punitive action. Second, we examined victim blame and perpetrator blame as moderators of this more complex set of manipulations of sexual orientation information. Although not of theoretical interest, juror sex and support for the death penalty were used as control variables because they may influence sentencing outcome. Social desirability was unrelated to support for the death penalty (r = –.09), victim blame (r –.01), perpetrator blame (r = –.06), and sentencing out- come (r = .04) and only participants meeting Witherspoon death-qualification criteria were used. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to assess differences between crime conditions on sentencing recommendation, followed by least squares difference post hoc analyses. There was a significant main effect of crime condition on sentencing recommendation, F(3, 138) = 5.46, p = .001, η2 = 0.11. Post hocs indicated that jurors supported the use of the death penalty significantly more in the hate crime condition than in any of the other conditions (see Table 1 for mean differences). Moderation analy- ses were the same as in Study 1; victim and perpetrator blame failed to moderate the main effect found in the first analysis of Study 2. Discussion Both studies show that mock jurors view evidence of a hate crime as an aggravating factor worthy of increased punitive action. Our results portray a bleak picture for hate crimes perpetrators, beyond being viewed as highly blameworthy in previous studies (Davies et al., 2006; Rayburn et al., 2003). A natural question arises concerning hate crimes policy: If mock jurors 859 Table 1 Study 2 ANOVA: Likelihood of Assigning the Death Penalty by Crime Condition Note: For all effect sizes, comparisons were made between the hate crime condition and the other specified condition. ANOVA = analysis of variance. a. Crime Condition refers to experimental condition of manipulated victim and perpetrator sexual orientation. b. M = average value of likelihood of assigning the death penalty. c. SD = standard deviation. believe hate constitutes an aggravating factor, should all related legislation follow suit? Naturally, we must acknowledge the inherent limitations of mock jury studies. These include the lack of group deliberation and demo- graphic restrictions (e.g., age, socioeconomic status). However, Haney (1993) noted that such research has been utilized in legal decision making. Therefore, the debate about inclusion of sexual orientation in the hate crimes legislation may benefit from attention to how mock jurors and jury panel members view such situations. The second aim of these studies was to assess plausible explanations for increased punitive action toward hate crime perpetrators. Attribution of blame was selected over other possible explications (e.g., just-world belief) because of analogous empirical data showing attribution of blame as a potent explanatory pathway (e.g., Osofsky et al., 2005; Rye et al., 2006). Study 1 showed victim blame to moderate assignment of the death penalty. However, with additional information of perpetrator sexual orientation, Study 2 failed to show victim or perpetrator blame as moderating pathways to mock juror decision making. Attribution of blame appears to operate when streamlined hate evidence is presented, as was the case in Study 1. Presence of information on perpe- trator and victim sexual orientation may obfuscate evidence to the point where attribution of blame becomes too difficult to assign. In Study 1, no sexual orientation information was provided in the control condition and only victim sexual orientation was included in the hate crime condition. Hence, perpetrator sexual orientation was inferred in the Study 1 hate crime 860 condition. In Study 2, each condition featured perpetrator and victim sexual orientation, thereby complicating perceptions of the parties involved. Overall, we can conclude that the more information concerning sexual orientation that is known, the less of an impact attribution of blame appears to play. Conclusion The answer to whether hate crime definitions should include sexual ori- entation cannot be answered by one or even several studies. This fact not- withstanding, examination of such questions using externally valid samples and designs can shed light on this issue. In addition, attribution of blame, as measured by Rayburn and colleagues’ (2003) definition, appears to play an important role in sexual orientation–based hate crimes when limited infor- mation is provided. Therefore, juror perceptions of blame may be worthy of attention for attorneys and trial consultants in jury selection. Moreover, investigation of blame attribution between disparate types of hate crimes (i.e., race, gender, sexual orientation) may shed light on how such beliefs operate in decision making. Finally, future work examining explanations of hate crime punishments may also focus on perceptions of responsibility. References Bandura, A. ( 1999).

Pair are accused of defacing Black Lives Matter mural with black paint
They were caught on video painting over the city-sanctioned mural outside courthouse in Martinez, California, on July 4
Couple's lawyer accused Contra Costa district attorney of being funded by George Soros and overcharging his clients
A California couple who were seen in a viral video painting over a Black Lives Matter mural have pleaded not guilty to hate crime charges, with their attorney calling the allegations against them 'outrageous and politicized.' 
Nicole Anderson and David Nelson arrived at the courthouse in Martinez on Tuesday to enter pleas of not guilty to three misdemeanor counts, including vandalism and hate crime, stemming from last month's incident. 
Anderson, 42, and Nelson, 53, were captured on video on July 4 defacing a city-sanctioned Black Lives Matter mural in front of the Wakefield Taylor Courthouse by painting over it with black paint. 
The couple did not comment on the allegations against them on Tuesday following their brief court appearance, but their defense lawyer, Bill Essayli, addressed reporters outside court, accusing Contra Costa County District Attorney Diana Becton of overcharging his clients. 
'Had she just charged vandalism, that would be a whole different issue,' Essayli said. 'The fact that she charged it as vandalism and as a hate crime is really what makes this problematic. It's a reach, it's an overcharge. In our view, it's a political message, and the justice system should not be weaponized in that manner.'
According to the district attorney's office, a Martinez resident applied for a permit to paint the temporary mural in front of the local courthouse on July 1. The permit was approved and the painting took place three days later. 
Nelson, wearing an American flag-themed T-shirt, and Anderson, decked out in Donald Trump campaign attire, arrived at the scene of the mural after it was completed with paint supplies. 
Anderson was caught on camera using a large paint roller to paint over the letters 'B' and 'L' in the word Black, which had been painted yellow. 
When one witness asks the woman 'what's wrong with you,' her male companion replies 'we're sick of the narrative, that's what is wrong'.
'The narrative of police brutality, the narrative of oppression, the narrative of racism, it's a lie,' Nelson, sporting his 'MAGA' hat, adds.
Nelson, who was recording the incident, then points to the Black Lives Matter sign and calls it 'racism'.
An argument is sparked between Nelson and onlookers while Anderson continues to damage the mural.
'There is no oppression. There is no racism,' Nelson says. 'It's a leftist lie...from the media.'
Anderson then becomes enraged at the witnesses and exclaims 'keep that s****' in f****** New York! It's not happening in my town!'
In the wake of the vandalism, protests were held in Martinez and the city's mayor spoke out against all hate crimes. 
But according to Essayli, his clients' actions did not amount to a civil rights violation. 
'It was done to express a viewpoint that they disagreed with the city endorsing [the] Black Lives Matter organization, which I said is anti-police and its anti-American,' Essayli said. 
The lawyer, who previously ran an unsuccessful campaign for a state office as a Republican, accused the district attorney of being funded by democratic billionaire donor George Soros and criminalizing different political views, reported The Mercury News. 
'Just as peaceful protesters have the right to march and display their political views in a myriad of different ways, they have the same right to display their dissatisfaction and disagreement with their tax dollars being used to sponsor a radical organization, Black Lives Matter,' Essayli said, according to KABC. 
The defaced mural has since been repainted. Nelson and Anderson are due back in court on October 13. 
Both Nelson and Anderson are charged with violation of civil rights, vandalism under $400 and possession of tools to commit vandalism or graffiti.
If convicted, both defendants face up to a year in county jail.
The first Black Lives Matter mural was painted in Washington, DC, near the White House in June amid protests against systemic racism and police brutality sparked by the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. 
Murals for the movement soon started appearing in major cities like New York City, where Mayor Bill de Blasio last month sanctioned the painting of a giant Black Lives Matter sign outside the Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan. 
The Manhattan mural has since been defaced multiple times, most recently on July 17, when three people were arrested for throwing paint on the letters. "

The two were identified by the Contra Costa District Attorneys Office as Nicole Claudia Anderson, 42, and David Richard Nelson, 53, both of Martinez, Calif.
Diana Becton, the district attorney, said, The mural completed last weekend was a peaceful and powerful way to communicate the importance of Black lives in Contra Costa County and the country.
The mural was painted on July 4 in front of a courthouse in Martinez, a site that the city selected when it issued a permit to the murals organizer. Within an hour of its completion, it was vandalized, said the organizer, Justin Gomez.
Video of the episode showed a woman using black paint and a roller brush to cover the letters B and L. She was joined by a man in a red cap and a red shirt that reads Trump and Four More Years, who can be heard saying: Were sick of this narrative and the narrative of police brutality, the narrative of oppression, the narrative of racism. Its a lie. Its a lie.
The woman, using two expletives, tells onlookers to keep this in New York, adding, This is not happening in my town.
The mural has been restored and residents were maintaining a presence to prevent further damage, Mr. Gomez had said.
In addition to the hate crime charges, the two people each face a charge of vandalism under $400 and possession of tools to commit vandalism or graffiti. All of the charges are misdemeanors and no court date has been scheduled, according to a spokesman for the district attorneys office.
If convicted, the couple face up to a year in jail, the district attorneys office said.
Separately, the Martinez police said that they were investigating the illegal painting of White Lives Matter on a road elsewhere in the city.
The police said in a statement that officers had found a woman painting over the white letters in black paint, and that they were trying to identify who had first painted the words. 2020 Legal Monitor Worldwide."

Barbecuing at Lake Merritt in Oakland. Selling water without a permit. Both instances in which a Black person was doing something deemed criminal by a white person. 
Both instances in which a white person called the police.Now, as racial tensions continue to flare as the nation protests the death of George Floyd and others, a California lawmaker plans to introduce legislation that would make discriminatory 911 calls a hate crime, joininga handful of states[1]in pushing to criminalize emergency calls. Three states — New York,Oregon[2]andWashington[3]— have recently enacted new laws.California's proposal 'would provide multiple pathways for justice for victims of racially weaponized 911 calls,' said Assemblyman Rob Bonta, an Alameda Democrat and the bill's author.He said calling thepolice[4]when no crime has occurred can be 'incredibly dangerous' for victims since officers have wide latitude to detain people in ways that can quickly escalate. The bill, however, isn't in print yet. Bonta says he is still formulating the circumstances in which Californians may be punished for bias.Similar instances of racially motivated 911 calls have occurred across the country. In May, a white woman walking her dog in Central Parkcalled[5]the police on a Black birdwatcher after he asked her to leash her dog.'I'm going to tell them there's an African American man threatening my life,' said Amy Cooper, the dog walker, during the recorded incident. Thegovernor[6]of New York signed legislation making these types of 911 calls a crime.Assemblyman Rob Bonta says 911 calls have been 'weaponized' against Black people and Californians need to understand that's 'unacceptable' behavior.In California, making afalse[7]police call is a misdemeanor with a $1,000 fine and up to a year in county jail. But there are currently no other protections for those on the receiving end of a racially motivated police call.In 2017, there were 28.1 million calls to 911 in California, the Orange County Registerreported[8]. And the Los Angeles area handled 8.5 million calls that year alone. The California Highway Patrol is largely responsible for 911 calls made on cell phones and often directs emergency calls to the appropriate authorities. Who would be responsible for tracking these types of calls remains unclear. Asdemands[9]to 'defund the police' continue to grow, questions remain about a larger police role. The California Police Chiefs Association had no comment on Bonta's proposal.For an instance to qualify as a hate crime, there has to be proof that the victim wastargeted[10]because they belonged to a protected group. Bonta said proving these calls are hate crimes 'can definitely be a challenge.' He pointed to the Central Park incident as an obvious example of a racially motivated call.'She knew exactly what she was doing,' Bonta said. 'He was not harassing her. She was calling based on race.'In fact, some of the most progressive parts of California are where obvious cases of racial prejudice appear. In the Bay Area, a man identified as Mali Watkins wasdetained[11]by police officers in May after the police received a call about someone dancing in the street. Body camera footage of the arrest shows an officer calling Watkins' movements jazzercise.'It looks like you were dancing. I was watching you for a little bit, it's like jazzercise type of thing,' an officer says in thefootage[12].In 2018, a womancalled[13]the police over the use of a charcoal grill at Lake Merritt in Oakland. In another incident that year, a woman in San Franciscocalled[14]the police on an 8-year-old girl for selling water without a permit.Bonta says, if anything, a bill is needed to acknowledge this behavior is unacceptable and harms people. 'They're incidents where police do not need to be called,' he said.Even if the state doesn't act, local jurisdictions are moving toward change.Los Angeles[15]andSan Francisco[16]are calling for legislation based on racial prejudice. In Santa Clara County, some local officials want racism to be declared a public healthcrisis[17].For Californians on the receiving end of racist 911 calls, it can be difficult to sue.'It's hard to get damages,' said Laura Gómez, a UCLA law professor. 'It's hard to find a lawyer willing to take that case because there's not going to be a lot of money to recover.'Though there have been exceptions, including one in Los Angeles. In 2014, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge David S. Cunninghamsettled[18]with UCLA after Cunningham alleged mistreatment and racial profiling by campus police. UCLA agreed to pay $500,000, though Cunningham originallyfiled[19]a $10 million claim.And, after an arrest in 2015 by the New York Police Department,Thabo Sefolosha[20], an NBA basketball player,settled[21]with the department for $4 million. Sefolosha said the police caused injuries while he was arrested including a fractured fibula and ligament damage.Still, access remains an issue for many Californians. Bonta said his bill would give victims of the 911 calls more legal options. He added there must be consequences for people who make the racially motivated 911 calls.'We're not going to tolerate these acts,' he said.

In June 2020, Leight discussed with The Hollywood Reporter's[8] 'TV's Top 5' podcast the decision to have Hate Crimes episodes air on Peacock.'I think it was perceived to be a better fit with Peacock. The vocabulary people use when they commit hate crimes is not acceptable on network television, and that's an interesting consideration,' he said. 'I think [Hate Crimes] is a show that needs to be made. Where it dovetails with SVU, it's about the toll a hate crime takes on a victim, a victim's family, and a community.'As of right now, no air date has been announced for the spin-off.

As a result, Buffalo City Court Judge Barbara Johnson-Lee issued a no-appearance warrant for Michael Cremen, 47, of Franklinville.
Cremen is charged with harassment, criminal possession of a weapon and a hate crime charge of menacing for the August incident.
According to a complaint filed with Buffalo Police, Cremen and another man were in the middle of the street at the intersection of Hertel and Parkside, using racial slurs and threatening the protesters.
At one point, the complaint says, he displayed a knife and pushed one of the protesters.
It's also alleged that he could be heard shouting the n-word.
Johnson-Lee had rescheduled Cremen's appearance when he failed to show for his arraignment.
Erie County DA John Flynn says the court received a concerning email from someone believed to be Cremen.
He read a portion of that email:
""I will not be compelled by any means to violate my conscious. Therefore, I will not wear a mask to any court proceeding or attend any court proceeding in which any person involved is wearing a face mask. If you do issue a warrant for my arrest it is unlawful and please understand that anyone that approaches my person, wife or property, especially armed, wearing a badge and/or face mask, I consider to be a very dangerous threat to my life and my lord will severely punish those in violation of his order of protection over my life.""
""It's clear from his communication that one: he's not coming to court today"" said Flynn. ""And two: the reason why I say this and publicly talk about this is I'm concerned for public safety for him and anyone around him. I'm concerned for any law enforcement officer that does go to his house. And therefore I want that it known publicly for every law enforcement agency to be concerned about him which I will communicate to them directly, but I want that known to the public, as well, that I have a serious concern about the public safety surrounding this individual here.""
Under New York's new bail reform that went into effect at the beginning of the year, it says you have to wait 48 hours so that someone has the chance to come back to court.
Flynn argues the email is Cremen giving notice he never plans to show up though.
The Erie County DAs Office submitted a motion requesting the Court reconsider its decision to not issue a bench warrant for Cremen. That motion was denied by Judge Barbara R. Johnson-Lee.
According to the DA's office, the judge said on the record that if Cremen does not appear either in person or virtually for his arraignment, she will issue a no appearance warrant. 2020 Legal Monitor Worldwide."

The vandalism at a South Florida parish is just the latest in a long list of incidents targeting churches across the US in recent weeks.
The beheaded statue was found by Deacon Edivaldo da Saliva inside the Good Shepherd Catholic Church in West Kendall, Florida.
Da Silva told Local 10 News that he found the monument headless and toppled off its pedestal in what members of the parish assume was a violent act of vandalism.
""We have seen this happening all over the country,"" he said.
Da Silva said that the church has several surveillance cameras, but none of them point to where the statue once stood.
Still, he hopes the footage will be able to help the church find the people responsible.
The Archdiocese of Miami told Local 10 News that they want police to investigate the vandalism as a hate crime.
""This is another attack on the Catholic Church which is happening across the country,"" they said.
There have been a handful of attacks on Catholic churches in just the past couple of days, with some vandalized and several set on fire.
In Los Angeles over the weekend, a nearly 250 year old Catholic church called the San Gabriel Mission was engulfed in flames.
Some suspect it could have been arson because of the surrounding statues of St Junipero Serra.
Statues of the 18th-century Franciscan priest, who critics say was complicit in an imperial conquest that oppressed Native Americans, have reportedly been targeted by Black Lives Matter protesters in other parts of LA.
In Florida, also over the weekend, a 24-year-old man reportedly drove his car into the Queen of Peace Catholic Church in Ocala before setting it on fire as well. He was arrested and is facing several charges.
In New York City on Friday, a statue of the Virgin Mary was desecrated with the word, ""IDOL.""
The NYPD confirmed that they are investigating the vandalization of the statue, which occurred shortly after 3am."
52,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1/Files (250).DOCX","Spokesman Review (Spokane, WA)",2020-11-21,"1214 words","A; Pg. 008","Lewis Kamb Seattle Times",NA,"Washington's increasing hate crime numbers in latest report tell only part of the story, experts say",FALSE,"SEATTLE - It seems counterintuitive, but some law enforcement experts in Washington can see progress in the escalating numbers of reported hate crimes statewide, in the wake of the FBI's latest annual report released this week showing that the criminal offenses motivated by bias have reached record levels nationwide.
Washington's reported number of hate crimes rose from 506 reported in 2018 to 542 last year - the latest uptick in what's been a rising trend documented in recent years in the FBI's Uniform Crime Report, the agency's annual compilation of crime statistics reported by local law enforcement departments nationwide.
With its 7% increase, Washington - which typically rates among the states with the most reported bias crimes - climbed one rung higher into third place in the national rankings for the undesirable category, trailing only California, with 1,015 reported offenses, and New York, with 611.
Washington has such a high ranking in part because people here are comparatively more likely to report the hate crimes that happen to them, experts said - and while higher rates of reporting are a good thing, they also highlight the sheer volume of hate crimes that are committed in Washington and nationwide.
""I think Washington state does a remarkably good job of reporting these incidents because we have an active citizenry that pays more attention to them,"" said Monisha Harrell, chair of Equal Rights Washington, a statewide advocacy group for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer residents.
""But where Washington is absolutely no exception is the crimes we're seeing here,"" Harrell added. ""Our top (bias) crimes are against Black people, then it's religion and LGBTQ. That matches trends across the nation and tells me that clearly, like everywhere else, we've got work to do.""
The rising number of reports reflected in the FBI's stats underscore what anti-bias advocates say they're routinely experiencing these days.
""We get reports almost daily from the public about incidents of violence or hate,"" said Kendall Kosai, interim regional director of the Anti-Defamation League, Pacific Northwest. ""We are pretty much busier than we've ever been before.""
While useful in some ways, the FBI's bias crime data varies wildly from state to state, largely depending on different levels of participation and assorted reporting methods by local police agencies. In turn, the annual report provides an apples-to-oranges comparison, at best.
""We have to take those (statistics) with a grain of salt,"" said FBI Supervisory Special Agent Ryan Bruett, statewide program coordinator for Hate Crimes and Civil Rights in Washington. ""It's difficult to draw too many conclusions from the data.""
Case in point: Fourteen states reported 20 or fewer hate crimes for all of last year, with Mississippi reporting just five offenses and Alabama failing to record a single one. The number of local police agencies submitting hate crime reports to the FBI last year also ranged from none in Alabama to 208 in New Jersey, illustrating the spottiness in local participation that the FBI relies upon to compile the statistics.
So, in that sense, the number of reported hate crimes in Washington ""can be seen as a positive,"" Bruett said, because ""it shows that, here in Washington, there's more reporting of these kinds of incidents.""
""And that's a good thing,"" he added. ""Much like sexual assault cases, one of our long-running concerns is that hate crimes are under-reported.""
Even in Washington, underreporting of hate crimes remains a problem, said Kosai, the regional ADL director. Several major cities, including Kirkland, Lakewood, Edmonds and Pasco failed to report a single hate crime to the FBI, he noted.
Another factor that can skew the FBI stats is the variety, or total lacking, of state laws defining what constitutes a hate crime. While a set of federal acts that generally outlaw threatening or injuring someone else based on race, color, religion, sexual orientation and other grounds could apply to crimes committed in any state, just 32 states had their own bias crime statutes as recently as five years ago. Today, all but three states have hate crime laws, though they vary significantly from one state to another.
Washington's malicious harassment law specifies eight categories for bias, including race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, gender, sexual orientation and mental, physical or sensory disability. Seattle also has its own hate crime law that includes five additional categories: homelessness, marital status, political ideology, age and parental status.
Beyond using the annual FBI numbers to compare Washington to other states or to its past, experts say the rising numbers here generally tell a story of progress in outreach work. The typical targets of hate crimes - racial, ethnic and religious minorities, immigrants and LGBTQ people - are communities traditionally reluctant to report crimes to police, they said.
""We really want and need people to come forward to report these kinds of crimes,"" said Seattle Police Det. Elizabeth Wareing, the only full-time bias crimes coordinator assigned to a police agency in Washington. ""So if we're building trust with the people who are being victimized, we're going to see higher numbers. We're just going to have to accept that, and Seattle is a perfect example.""
Most of Washington's reported hate crime comes through the Seattle Police Department. Unlike most local police agencies in this state or nationwide, Seattle not only tracks offenses motivated by bias but also records crimes that are committed for other reasons but also include an element of bias, as well as ""noncriminal bias incidents.""
The latter two categories might include a robbery suspect who commits a crime for financial motivations but shouts a racial slur at a security guard who chases him down; and a passing motorist who yells ""go back to your country"" to a pedestrian wearing a hijab.
While neither incident would show up as a hate crime in the FBI's annual report, documenting them helps demonstrate to targeted communities that police take these matters seriously, which in turn builds trust and increases overall reporting, Wareing said.
""Most agencies see the very tip of the iceberg on these incidents,"" she said. ""We see a little bit more than that.""
Seattle's reporting approach, updated and posted regularly on the department's website, also provides a more nuanced perspective than the FBI statistics, Wareing said. In 2020 - just as it has every year since 2015, the year Wareing took on the bias crime coordinator's role - reported hate crimes have increased. But perhaps more telling is a spike in general reports of incivility and use of inflammatory language, Wareing said.
""These aren't necessarily even someone committing a crime, just saying something that's hurtful,"" she said. ""People are reporting it more and more and our officers are doing a good job of capturing it. And that's important for people to feel heard.""
While people sometimes equate the term ""hate crime"" with overt acts of terrorism by white supremacist groups or other extremists, the reports that local agencies are fielding and passing along to the FBI typically are committed by someone who lives or works near you, Wareing and Bruett said."

The New York chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-NY), the nation's largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, today called on the NYPD to initiate a hate crime probe after a teenager was allegedly assaulted with a baseball bat in an anti-immigrant, anti-Arab, and racially charged attack. The incident reportedly occurred August 13 in Staten Island.
The victim of the alleged hate crime is Tarek Elsayed, an 18-year-old Egyptian-American. According to the victim, he was leaving Dartmouth Loop in his car when the assailant, a middle-aged male, approached him and called him a ""sand n***er."" The assailant then punctured Elsayed's rear passenger tire and began walking to his driver side with a baseball bat, unbeknownst to Elsayed.
NOTE: CAIR-NY represents Elsayed and his family.
PHOTOS OF VICTIM AFTER ASSAULT: https://www.cair.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Elsayed.png
As Elsayed exited his car to check his tire, the assailant allegedly struck him with a baseball bat in the head and forearm. Elsayed became disoriented and fell to the ground. The assailant reportedly attempted to strike Elsayed again with the baseball bat. Elsayed was able to get away, though the assailant chased him for a distance. During the incident, the assailant told him: ""I'll break your f***ing jaw,"" ""go back to your country you piece of sh*t,"" ""I know where your friends live,"" and ""you f***ing sand ni***r.""
A large crowd assembled at the scene of the assault, including Elsayed's friends, and waited for the police. The assailant reportedly continued to curse Elsayed and his friends with epithets and threats such as ""sand ni***rs,"" ""f***ing Arabs,"" ""I'm going to kill you,"" and ""I'm going to get my people to take care of you.""
The assailant was arrested, and Elsayed was taken by ambulance to a local hospital. He suffered a broken forearm and head injury--among other injuries. In a previous interaction, the assailant made similar epithets and threats directed at Elsayed and his friends.
CAIR-NY Legal Director Ahmed Mohamed stated:
""This brazen attack on a teenager is disturbing and has no place in our city. No one should be attacked or live in fear because of their race or ethnicity. The assailant made his motives very clear and the NYPD needs to open a hate crime investigation.""
Last week, CAIR-NY called on the NYPD to initiate a hate crimes probe after a teenage woman wearing a hijab was assaulted with a bottle of urine and Islamophobic slurs.

The college student who was allegedly attacked by Meryl Streep's nephew in an East Hampton road rage incident has accused the 31-year-old of racism for allegedly yelling anti-Hispanic slurs while grabbing him by the neck. 
David Peralta, 18, was hospitalized with severe head trauma and needed emergency surgery after the altercation with Charles Harrison Streep, 31, in a parking lot outside a Chase bank in the affluent New York town on August 24. 
Streep, the son of Meryl's brother Dana Streep and his wife Mary, was arrested days later and charged with beating and choking the Long Island student.
Peralta is now planning to sue the star's famous nephew, claiming the attack was an anti-Hispanic hate crime.
An attorney for the 18-year-old told New York Daily News Streep shouted anti-Hispanic slurs at Peralta during the attack and said he is calling for the 31-year-old to face hate crime charges over the incident. 
'We find it exceedingly ironic that Streep, whose family, including his famous aunt, purport to sympathize with the plight of immigrants and working-class people everywhere, would unleash this violent and racially charged attack on this innocent, hardworking young man,' said Edmond Chakmakian Tuesday. 
Chakmakian said Peralta, who was about to start his junior year studying criminal justice at St. John's University when the alleged attack took place, will suffer permanent cognitive damage from his injuries and can't recall simple things.
'He couldn't even give me his date of birth when I spoke to him the other day,' said Chakmakian. 
Police said Streep attacked Peralta, who lives in Springs, East Hampton, in the Chase Bank parking lot around 11:30 a.m. on August 24. 
Peralta was taking a ride with his girlfriend in his new car - a red Ford Mustang - when he had a near miss with Streep's Audi convertible at the intersection of Main Street and The Circle, according to court papers.
The two men allegedly exchanged words and Streep made a u-turn in his car, following the teen into the parking lot and getting out of his vehicle. 
Streep is then accused of 'striking, grabbing and lifting [the victim] off the ground by the neck with his arms' and of 'lifting his limp body off the ground and then throwing him to the ground,' according to the criminal complaint. 
Chakmakian claimed Streep mocked Peralta, saying 'What are you, 14 years old?' and 'spewed racial epithets during the attack.' 
Police responded to several 911 calls about the incident but Streep had left the scene before they arrived. 
Peralta, whose family is from Ecuador, initially turned down medical attention but was later taken to Stony Brook Southampton Hospital as his condition deteriorated that day.
He suffered a brain bleed which required the removal of his skull cap to stem the bleed and underwent emergency surgery, his lawyer said. 
Streep was arrested three days after the attack on August 27 at a home on Pondview Lane in East Hampton. 
According to Zillow, the six-bedroom $6.5 million property belongs to Streep's mother Mary. 
Streep was charged in East Hampton Town Court with felony counts of second-degree assault and second-degree strangulation. 
He was arraigned and released on $5,000 bail. 
Meryl's nephew, who goes by the name Charlie, had a privileged upbringing, attending New Canaan High School in Connecticut before going to the University of Virginia.
His famous aunt is one of the biggest names in Hollywood and holds the record for the most - 21 -Oscar nominations. "

Max Rose:
Congressman Max Rose, who has strongly condemned discrimination against the Asian American community throughout the coronavirus pandemic, joined a bipartisan group of 150 Members of Congress in calling for the Attorney General to take action and publicly condemn discrimination and violence toward Asian Americans.
""The hate, violence, harassment and discrimination that has been hurled upon those in the Asian American community is gut-wrenching, horrible and wrong,"" Rose said. ""I hear from families and seniors that they're afraid to leave their homes, business owners forced to shut down, and far too many who have been victim to street attacks, verbal assaults, or racist fliers. It has no place in our community and we all must stand strong in solidarity against it. I'm proud to see so many of my colleagues join together from both parties to strongly condemn these actions, now the Administration must join the chorus.""
Since the beginning of the crisis, there have been numerous reports of Asian Americans being threatened, harassed, or assaulted. As of June 3, the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council reported 2,066 incidents of coronavirus-related discrimination. As a result, these communities, in addition to working to combat the coronavirus, are left fighting an additional frontthat of hate and injustice.
""We write to draw particular attention to an increase in verbal and physical attacks as well as discrimination towards Asian Americans who have been wrongly blamed for the virus' spread,"" wrote Rose and the bipartisan Members of Congress in a letter to Attorney General William Barr. ""We respectfully request that you publicly condemn acts of anti-Asian bias, and provide us with regular status updates regarding the steps the Department of Justice is taking and will take going forward to combat this behavior.""
Rose is a co-sponsor of the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which was introduced by fellow New York City Congressmember Grace Meng. The legislation seeks to provide greater federal government oversight of COVID-19 hate crimes, and require the Department of Justice to provide Congress with regular updates on the status of reported bias incidents.
Last month, Rose and local elected officials from South Brooklyn hosted a roundtable with Chinese-American business owners and community leaders to discuss efforts to support small businesses and the community through the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including against rising xenophobia and discrimination."

The New York chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-NY), the nation's largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, called on the NYPD to initiate a hate crimes probe after a teenage woman wearing a hijab was assaulted with a bottle of urine and Islamophobic slurs. The Civil Rights organization also called on the Commission on Human Rights to increase awareness on Islamophobia to stem the tide of bias incidents.
The victim of the alleged incident is Somaia Harrati, a 17-year-old American Moroccan Muslim woman that wears hijab, a religious head covering. According to the victim, on August 10 while waiting at a bus stop on Zerga and Westchester in the Bronx, young teenagers began throwing empty bottles at her and the small group of individuals at the bus stop. Ms. Harrati approached the teenagers, who were at the subway platform overlooking the bus stop and asked them to stop their conduct. Once Ms. Harrati returned to the bus stop, the teenagers threw a bottle of Mountain Dew that was filled with urine at her. The teenagers yelled at Harrati that the bottled was filled with urine. The teenagers yelled Islamphobic and disparaging slurs at Ms. Harrati, including calling her ""Bin Laden"" and yelling ""Allah Akbar"" during the incident. The teenagers also made denigrating comments about Ms. Harrati's hijab.
While Ms. Harrati called and waited on the NYPD, the teenagers entered the subway and left the scene. Once police arrived, they informed Ms. Harrati that there was nothing they could do and allegedly did not file a report. According to Ms. Harrati, the responding officers did not provide her any documentation or a police report number.
CAIR-NY Legal Director Ahmed Mohamed states:
""This incident is very disturbing on many levels. The NYPD needs to explain to the Muslim community and the public why Somaia was not provided a complaint number which indicates that the officers did not write up the incident. It is important for incidents like this to be appropriately classified. Accordingly, the NYPD must initiate a hate crimes probe. The Commission on Human Rights has a role to play in combating hate in our city, and we call on the Commission to raise awareness about Islamophobia and the struggles of Muslim women that chose to wear a hijab. These teenagers need to learn that this conduct is unacceptable and make amends by sincerely apologizing to Somaia and engaging in education about Islam, Islamophobia, and the beauty of the hijab.""
CAIR-NY's mission is to protect civil rights, enhance understanding of Islam, promote justice, and empower American Muslims.

The New York chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-NY), the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, today called on the NYPD to initiate a hate crime probe after a Muslim father was allegedly assaulted in an apparent anti-Muslim attack.
The incident reportedly occurred on November 6 in Rego Park, Queens.
The victims of the alleged hate crime, 38-year-old Egyptian-American Khaled Aly and his wife, Neamat Taha, and their two children, age 6 and 8, were reportedly returning home on Friday night at approximately 11 p.m
As the family parked their car in their parking spot and went to walk into the apartment complex, the assailants confronted them and began to harass Taha. Taha wears a hijab, Muslim headscarf. The female assailant grabbed Taha while the male assailant began to aggressively approach Taha. Prior to grabbing Taha, the assailants told the family that “we are in America. ” Aly asked the assailants to leave them alone and to not touch his wife. Without warning, the assailants then attacked Aly and viciously beat him while his kids watched in horror.
During the assault, the assailants repeatedly cursed at Aly and called him a “f***ing Muslim” and threatened to “kill your f***ing family. ” Taha called 911 during the assault. As the NYPD arrived on the scene, the assailants fled.
Aly was immediately rushed to the hospital where he was hospitalized and underwent surgery for his ‎injuries. Aly was released from the hospital Monday evening. ‎
Note: CAIR-NY represents Aly and his family.

The alleged assailants have been identified as neighbors who live in the apartment complex. Despite having the identities of the assailants and witnesses to the violent assault, the NYPD has failed to make any arrest.
On Saturday at approximately 4:30 a.m as Taha returned to the apartment complex from the hospital, she was confronted by the male assailant who bragged about assaulting Aly and threatened Taha and her family stating “I’m going to burn you and burn your family. ” Taha was accompanied by male friends. Taha and her family have not returned to their apartment out of fear for their safety.
The family reports that the assailants have been harassing them over an extended period of time. The family previously filed a police report over the harassment. The family also reported the harassment and threats to the apartment complex’s management.
CAIR-NY Legal Director Ahmed Mohamed stated:
“Hate crimes targeting the Muslim community need to be taken seriously. Again and again we are seeing that bias motivated crimes targeting Muslims are being minimized and not properly investigated. Mr. Aly was beaten mercilessly in front of his young children, who are now traumatized, and the NYPD knows the identities of the assailants and where they reside. Yet, the NYPD has failed to make any arrests. It is outrageous and speaks to the lack of urgency to investigating crimes targeting the Muslim community. ”"

54 Hate Crimes and Stigma-Related Experiences Among Sexual Minority Adults in the United StatesPrevalence Estimates From a National Probability Sample SAGE Publications, Inc.200910.1177/0886260508316477 Gregory M.Herek University of California, Davis Using survey responses collected via the Internet from a U.S. national probability sample of gay, lesbian, and bisexual adults (N = 662), this article reports prevalence estimates of criminal victimization and related experiences based on the target's sexual orientation. Approximately 20% of respondents reported having experienced a person or property crime based on their sexual orientation; about half had experienced verbal harassment, and more than 1 in 10 reported having experienced employment or housing discrimination. Gay men were significantly more likely than lesbians or bisexuals to experience violence and property crimes. Employment and housing discrimination were significantly more likely among gay men and lesbians than among bisexual men and women. Implications for future research and policy are discussed. bisexuals discrimination gay men hate crimes lesbians sexual minorities violence In 1989, the National Institute of Mental Health convened an expert panel on antigay violence to review existing knowledge and identify research needs. The panel named collection of prevalence data as a top research pri- ority and urged that such data be obtained from probability samples when possible (Herek & Berrill, 1990). Since then, data collected by the Federal possible (Herek & Berrill, 1990). Since then, data collected by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (e.g., 2005), the National Crime Victimization Survey Author's Note: Data collection for this project was supported by a grant from the Gill Foundation. The author thanks Aaron Norton, Thomas Allen, and Charles Sims for their assis- tance. Address correspondence to Gregory Herek, Psychology Department, University of California, Davis, California 95616. 55 (Harlow, 2005), and the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (e.g., 2005) have shown that criminal enactments of sexual stigma are widespread (Herek & Sims, 2007). However, prevalence data on criminal victimization among lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals are still fragmentary and derived almost entirely from convenience samples. Berrill (1992) compiled data from 24 published and unpublished studies conducted between 1977 and 1991 by academic researchers and community- based organizations, all but 1 of them using convenience samples of gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals. Across studies, a median of 9% of respondents reported having been the target of an aggravated assault (i.e., assault with a weapon) because of their sexual orientation; 17% reported simple physical assault (i.e., without a weapon); 19% reported vandalism of their personal property; 44% had been threatened with violence; 33% had been chased or followed; 25% reported having objects thrown at them; 13% had been spat on; and 80% had been verbally harassed (Berrill, 1992). Most of the studies did not report data separately by respondents' gender or sexual orientation. More recently, in a study of 2,259 lesbian, gay, and bisexual adults in the greater Sacramento, California, area, 28% of gay men, 19% of lesbians, 27% of bisexual men, and 15% of bisexual women reported having experienced some type of criminal victimization since age 16 because of their sexual orien- tation (ns = 898, 980, 191, and 190, respectively; Herek, Gillis, & Cogan, 1999). This includes respondents who reported experiencing a simple or aggra- vated assault (13% of gay men, 7% of lesbians, 11% of bisexual men, and 5% of bisexual women) or a sexual assault based on their sexual orientation (4% of gay men, 3% of lesbians, 7% of bisexual men, and 4% of bisexual women). Other research has focused on particular age groups in sexual minority communities. In a sample of 1,248 young gay and bisexual men (M = 23 years, range = 18-27 years) recruited in three southwestern U.S. cities, 5% reported they had experienced physical violence because of their sexual ori- entation during the previous 6 months (Huebner, Rebchook, & Kegeles, 2004). In a sample of 194 lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths (age range = 15- 21 yrs) recruited from service agencies across the United States, 9% reported at least one aggravated assault based on their sexual orientation, 18% had experienced a simple assault, 22% had been sexually assaulted, and 44% had been threatened with attack (Pilkington & D'Augelli, 1995). In a study of sexual minority youths recruited through community-based organizations in New York City and its suburbs, D'Augelli and his col- leagues found that 11% reported physical violence based on their sexual orientation, 9% reported sexual violence, and 78% reported verbal threats or harassment (D'Augelli, Grossman, & Starks, 2006). At the other end of 56 the age continuum, D'Augelli and Grossman (2001) documented the life- time occurrence of hate crime victimization among older (>59 years) les- bian, gay, and bisexual adults recruited from across the United States (n = 416). In that sample, 16% had been physically attacked at some time in their life, 7% had been sexually assaulted, 11% reported having had objects thrown at them, and 29% had been threatened with violence. It is difficult to use these studies to derive an estimate of the population prevalence of hate crime victimization against U.S. sexual minorities because of variations in how they categorized crimes, the time frames within which they assessed victimization, and how they reported their data (e.g., some stud- ies reported findings separately for men and women, or homosexuals and bisexuals, whereas others did not). Moreover, because nearly all of the surveys used convenience samples, the extent to which their results describe the entire U.S. gay, lesbian, and bisexual population cannot be determined. Prevalence data collected in three studies with probability samples fur- ther confirm that hate crime victimization is widespread. In a 1989 San Francisco Examiner national telephone survey, 5% of gay men (n = 287) and 10% of lesbians (n = 113) reported having been physically abused or assaulted in the previous year because they were gay (Results of Poll, 1989).1 In a 2000 Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) survey of 405 lesbian, gay, and bisexual adults residing in major U.S. population centers, 32% of respondents said they had been targeted for violence against their person or property because of their sexual orientation (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2001). In a probability sample of 912 Latino men who have sex with men, recruited from social venues in New York, Miami, and Los Angeles, 10% reported they had experienced violence as an adult because of their sexual orientation or femininity (Díaz, Ayala, Bein, Henne, & Marín, 2001). These pioneering surveys yielded valuable data but are nevertheless limited in the generalizability of their findings. Neither the San Francisco Examiner poll nor the KFF poll were published in a peer-reviewed journal. Few published details are available about the methodology of the Examiner survey, making it particularly difficult to evaluate. The KFF poll sampled respon- dents only in 15 U.S. cities, which may limit its generalizability, and the survey of Latino men focused on specific venues in only three cities. The present article addresses a gap in current knowledge by reporting data on the prevalence of antigay violence and related experiences in a national probability sample of sexual minority adults. Violence against individuals because of their presumed sexual orientation is conceptualized here as a man- ifestation of sexual stigma, that is, society's negative regard for any non- heterosexual behavior, identity, relationship, or community (Herek, 2004, 57 2008). Sexual stigma is a cultural belief system through which homosexual- ity is denigrated, discredited, and socially constructed as invalid relative to heterosexuality (Herek, 2008; Herek, Chopp, & Strohl, 2007). As with other forms of stigma, sexual stigma is expressed through society's institutions (e.g., through discriminatory laws and policies) and by its individual members. Individual enactments of stigma can range from personal ostracism to criminal attacks against people perceived to be homosexual or bisexual. Sexual stigma has important consequences for sexual minority individu- als. Whereas being the target of any violent crime can have negative psy- chological effects, victims of antigay violence are at heightened risk for psychological distress (Herek et al., 1999; Mills et al., 2004; see also McDevitt, Balboni, Garcia, & Gu, 2001). Hate crimes may have especially negative psychological sequelae because they attack a core aspect of the vic- tim's personal identity and community membership, components of the self that are particularly important to sexual minority individuals because of the stresses created by sexual stigma (Garnets, Herek, & Levy, 1990; Herek et al., 1999; Herek et al., 2007). In addition to stigma's direct effects, sexual minority individuals' awareness of its extent and their expectancies about when it will be enacted create a subjective sense of threat. This felt stigma (e.g., Scambler & Hopkins, 1986) can motivate them to engage in a variety of proactive behaviors aimed at shielding themselves from enacted stigma. Such strategies (e.g., concealing their sexual orientation) can protect them from directly experiencing enacted stigma but also restrict their opportunities for having normal social interaction and receiving social support (Herek, 2008). The present study assessed the prevalence of eight forms of enacted stigma and three aspects of felt stigma in a national probability sample of sexual minority individuals. The sample consisted of self-identified lesbian, gay, and bisexual adults randomly selected from an existing panel of more than 40,000 U.S. households. Panel members were recruited by Knowledge Networks (KN) using random-digit dialing (RDD) methods. On joining the panel, respondents agreed to participate regularly in online surveys, and were provided with free Internet access and equipment if they did not already have it. Thus, in contrast to Internet studies with volunteer samples recruited via the Web, the KN panel includes individuals who would not otherwise have Internet access because of their financial or social situation. Reflecting this fact, KN samples are demographically similar to other RDD samples and more closely match the U.S. population than do other Internet samples (Krosnick & Chang, 2001). Samples drawn from the KN panel have been used extensively in academic and government research (Knowledge Networks, 2007). 58 Method Sample and Procedure Members of the KN panel routinely answer a battery of background questions, including an item about their sexual orientation. Using these data, a sample was drawn of 902 English-speaking adults (>18 years) who had previously responded affirmatively to the question, “Are you yourself gay, lesbian, or bisexual?” Following standard KN procedures, they each received an e-mail invitation to complete the questionnaire at their conve- nience. A follow-up e-mail was sent to nonresponders after approximately one week. Neither invitation mentioned sexual orientation. As with all KN surveys, panel members were free to decline to participate. A total of 775 individuals (86%) accessed the questionnaire between September 13 and October 7, 2005. In response to a screening question at the beginning of the survey, 56 indicated they were heterosexual. They were thanked for their assistance and their survey was terminated. This left 719 self-identified lesbian, gay, and bisexual respondents who completed the questionnaire. Within that group, 56 households were represented by mul- tiple respondents. In these cases, one respondent was randomly selected from the household for inclusion in the data set, yielding a final sample of 662. Taking into account all attrition that has occurred in the KN panel since the earliest stage of RDD recruitment, the response rate for the pre- sent study was 30% (American Association for Public Opinion Research, 2006 [Formula 3]). This is a relatively high rate for contemporary com- mercial surveys (Holbrook, Krosnick, & Pfent, 2008). Measures The present data are based on a subset of questions from a larger ques- tionnaire. Only the relevant variables are discussed here. Enacted Stigma Eight questions were posed about how often respondents had experi- enced different forms of enacted stigma since age 18 because someone per- ceived them to be lesbian or bisexual (female respondents) or gay or bisexual (male respondents). The response options were never, once, twice, and three or more times. The questions assessed experiences of enacted 59 stigma within three general categories: criminal victimization, harassment and threats, and discrimination. To assess criminal victimization, respondents were asked how often they had experienced a crime against their person (“You were hit, beaten, physi- cally attacked, or sexually assaulted”) or property (“You were robbed, or your property was stolen, vandalized, or purposely damaged”) or an attempted crime (“Someone tried to attack you, rob you, or damage your property, but they didn't succeed”) based on their sexual orientation. To assess harassment and threats, respondents were asked about their experiences with antigay threats (“Someone threatened you with violence”) and harassment (“Someone verbally insulted or abused you” and “Someone threw an object at you”). To assess discrimination, respondents were asked about their experiences with sexual orientation discrimination in employment (“You were fired from your job or denied a job or promotion”) and housing (“You were prevented from moving into a house or apartment by a landlord or realtor”). Felt Stigma Felt stigma was assessed with three statements, each accompanied by a 5-point Likert-type response scale ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree. Utilizing Web software capabilities, the item wording was cus- tomized by inserting respondents' preferred term for characterizing their sexual orientation (gay, lesbian, bisexual, queer, etc.); each respondent had selected this term earlier in the questionnaire. The three statements (as worded for respondents who indicated gay was their preferred self-identifying term) were (a) “Most people where I live think less of a person who is gay”; (b) “Most employers where I live will hire openly gay people if they are qual- ified for the job”; (c) “Most people where I live would not want someone who is openly gay to take care of their children.” Demographic Data The survey included a question about the respondent's specific sexual orientation (bisexual or homosexual). Other demographic data—including respondents' gender, age, race and ethnicity, and highest educational level completed—had been collected previously by KN. Weighting Because the KN panel was recruited using RDD methods, the initial sam- ple design yielded a simple random sample with equal probability of selection 60 for all U.S. households with a telephone. However, the actual probability of selection for individual respondents was affected by multiple factors (e.g., differences in household size and the number of telephone lines in a single household). Following standard procedures for RDD samples (e.g., Kish, 1965), design weights were calculated and assigned to each case to adjust for unequal probability of selection.2 Because the use of weighted data necessitates special analytic procedures to correct standard errors (Lee & Forthofer, 2006), analyses were conducted using statistical software pack- ages that permit such correction (STATA and SPSS Complex Samples). Results Sample Characteristics The final sample consisted of 311 women (152 lesbians, 159 bisexuals) and 351 men (241 gay men, 110 bisexuals). When design weights were applied, the weighted sample was 14.6% lesbian (95% confidence interval [CI] = 11.6%-18.2%), 34.8% gay male (CI = 28.9%-41.2%), 23.7% bisexual female (CI = 18.8%-29.3%), and 26.9% bisexual male (CI = 19.1%-36.4%). Unless otherwise indicated, the weighted data are used hereafter. The respondents' mean age was 39 years (CI = 37.2-40.8). Gay men were significantly older (M = 45.3) than lesbians (M = 40.1), bisexual men (M = 36.6), and bisexual women (M = 31.8 years). In addition, lesbians were significantly older than bisexual women (for all statistically signifi- cant differences reported here, p < .05). The sample was 65.4% non- Hispanic White, 15.6% non-Hispanic Black, and 12.5% Hispanic, with the remaining 6.5% from other races or of mixed race or ethnicity. Compared with lesbians and bisexual women, significantly fewer bisexual men were non-Hispanic White (43.0%, compared with 74.4% of lesbians and 77.5% of bisexual women). Bisexual men were also substantially less likely than gay men (70.5%) to be non-Hispanic White, but the difference was not sta- tistically significant. Bisexual men were more likely than other respondents to be Hispanic (20.6%) or non-Hispanic Black (28.6%), but the differences were not statistically significant. Most respondents had earned a bachelor's degree (32.9%) or attended some college (31.4%). Only 7.3% did not have a high school diploma or equivalent. Compared with gay men and lesbians, bisexual men were significantly less likely to have a bachelor's degree: 15.9% of bisexual men had a degree, compared with 46.4% of gay men and 40.9% of lesbians. A more detailed demographic description of the sample will be reported elsewhere. 61 Experiences With Enacted Stigma Table 1 reports response frequencies and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each question about enacted stigma for the four sexual orientation groups. The response options are collapsed into three categories: once, twice or more, and never. Table 2 translates the Table 1 data into more easily interpretable categories. It details the proportions of respondents in each sexual orientation group who reported ever experiencing enacted stigma (combining the response options of once, twice, and three or more times), with specific forms of enacted stigma combined into larger categories when appropriate. As shown in the last column of Table 2, 13.1% of the sample reported having experienced violence against their person based on their sexual ori- entation at least once during their adult life, and 14.9% had experienced a property crime. Approximately 1 in 5 reported experiencing one or both types of crime, and this proportion increased to about 25% when attempted crimes were included. Overall, 12.5% of respondents reported having objects thrown at them because of their sexual orientation; 23.4% had been threatened with violence, and 49.2% had experienced verbal abuse. More than 1 respondent in 10 (11.2%) reported having experienced housing or employment discrimination because of her or his sexual orientation. Across the sexual orientation groups, gay men reported the highest lev- els of enacted stigma. They were significantly more likely than others to report experiences of antigay violence (24.9%) and antigay property crimes (28.1%). More than one third of gay men (37.6%) reported experiencing one or both types of crimes, compared with 12.5% of lesbians, 10.7% of bisexual men, and 12.7% of bisexual women. As indicated by the overlap- ping CIs in Table 1, differences among the latter groups were too small to be considered reliable. Gay men were significantly more likely than bisex- ual men to report having had objects thrown at them (21.1% vs. 5.6%). They were significantly more likely than lesbians and bisexual women to have been threatened with violence (35.4% of gay men vs. 17.3% of les- bians and 14.1% of bisexual women), and significantly more likely than bisexual women to report verbal abuse because of their sexual orientation (63.0% vs. 34.3%). Employment and housing discrimination were signifi- cantly more likely among gay men and lesbians (reported by 17.7% and 16.3%, respectively) than among bisexual men and women (3.7% and 6.8%, respectively). As noted above, the groups differed significantly in age, race and ethnic- ity, and educational level, which might account for the observed differences on enacted stigma. To test this hypothesis, separate logistic regression 62 P-0 9 *= CC U G7 E iw c 63 1-1 64 00 Of) 4-< cm F! h respons ¡f2. ... in -H o '53 Z i< 65 it- CA 2.

In each equation, the dependent variable was dichotomized (ever experiencing that form of enacted stigma vs. never experiencing it). The independent variables were age, edu- cation, race and ethnicity (coded as non-Hispanic White vs. Hispanic or non- White), and sexual orientation (coded as gay male vs. other groups). In the equations for the combined categories of criminal victimization and harass- ment, the odds ratios (ORs) for sexual orientation were statistically signifi- cant, indicating gay men were significantly more likely to report experiencing both categories of enacted stigma, even when demographic differences are controlled. (For criminal victimization, OR = 2.45, 95% CI = 1.36-4.41; for harassment, OR = 2.10, CI = 1.23-3.60.) The same pattern was observed for all of the individual forms of enacted stigma except attempted crimes (for which none of the variables yielded a statistically significant OR). A similar procedure was followed to assess whether lesbians and gay men's greater likelihood of experiencing employment or housing discrimi- nation was explained by group differences in age, education, and race. In this equation, sexual orientation was coded as homosexual versus bisexual. The OR for sexual orientation (3.29, CI = 1.58-6.85) was significant, indi- cating that the differences in discrimination were not due to demographic differences. Felt Stigma As shown in Table 3, substantial minorities of respondents expressed some degree of felt stigma. More than one third (34.6%) agreed (strongly or somewhat) that most people where they live think less of a sexual minor- ity individual; 25.5% disagreed that most employers will hire qualified sexual minority individuals, and 40.6% agreed that most people would not want a sexual minority individual to care for their children. Overall, a majority of respondents (54.7%, CI = 47.1-62.1%) gave at least one response indicative of felt stigma. As indicated by the overlapping CIs in Table 3, there were few significant differences among the sexual orientation groups in their responses to the individual felt stigma items. The only exception is that gay men were significantly less likely than lesbians to perceive sexual stigma in hiring: 54.8% agreed that most employers in their area will hire a qualified sexual minority person, compared with 32.3% of lesbians who agreed with this statement. 67 ■*^ M z 2. y 4) P;o ?

Scores could range from 1 (low felt stigma) to 5 (high felt stigma). As shown in the first row of Table 3, gay men scored the lowest on the scale and lesbians the highest (Ms = 2.79 and 3.11, respectively), but differences among the sexual orientation groups were not statistically significant. Association of Felt Stigma With Enacted Stigma Felt stigma scores were higher among respondents who reported having experienced person or property crimes or attempted crimes based on their sexual orientation compared with those who had not (Ms = 3.2 vs. 2.8, respectively), those who had experienced verbal threats or harassment com- pared with those who had not (Ms = 3.0 vs. 2.7, respectively), and those who had experienced employment or housing discrimination compared with those who had not (Ms = 3.2 vs. 2.8, respectively). These differences were not statistically significant. However, significant differences were observed on these variables within some sexual orientation groups. Lesbians who said they had experienced crimes or attempted crimes scored significantly higher on felt stigma compared with those who had not (Ms = 3.6 vs. 3.0, respectively). The difference was also significant among bisexual men (Ms = 3.6 vs. 2.6, respectively), but not gay men (Ms = 2.9 vs. 2.8) or bisexual women (Ms = 3.7 vs. 2.9). Felt stigma was significantly higher among lesbians who reported having experienced employ- ment or housing discrimination (Ms = 3.7 vs. 3.0 among those who had not). The difference was also significant for bisexual men (Ms = 3.9 vs. 2.8), but not for gay men (Ms = 2.9 vs. 2.8) or bisexual women (Ms = 3.2 vs. 2.9). Discussion The present study yields the most reliable estimates to date of the preva- lence of antigay victimization in the United States. The data indicate that approximately 20% of the U.S. sexual minority population has experienced a crime against their person or property since age 18 based on their sexual orientation. With attempted crimes included, the proportion increases to roughly 25%. Harassment is considerably more widespread, with about half of sexual minority adults reporting verbal abuse at some time in their adult life as a consequence of their sexual orientation. More than 1 sexual 69 minority adult in 10 has experienced housing or employment discrimina- tion because of her or his sexual orientation. The likelihood of experiencing victimization clearly is not uniform among sexual minorities. Gay men are at the greatest risk for person and property crimes. Approximately 38% of gay men in the present sample reported they had experienced one or both types of criminal victimization. Gay men also were more likely than lesbians and bisexuals to be harassed because of their sexual orientation. This pattern is consistent with previous findings that sexual minority men are at greater risk for antigay victimiza- tion than are sexual minority women (D'Augelli & Grossman, 2001; Herek et al., 1999). Several factors may account for this greater risk. Men are more likely than women to be victims of violent crime in general, espe- cially crimes committed by strangers (Catalano & Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2005). Most such crimes are perpetrated by heterosexually iden- tified men, who tend to hold more hostile attitudes toward sexual minority males than toward sexual minority females (Herek, 2002a, 2002b). In addi- tion, gay men may be more visible targets than sexual minority women and bisexual men because, for example, they may be more likely to frequent gay-oriented venues and the public spaces around them. Lesbians and gay men were significantly more likely than bisexuals to report discrimination based on their sexual orientation. This pattern proba- bly cannot be attributed to attitudinal differences among the agents of dis- crimination because heterosexuals' attitudes toward bisexuals tend to be somewhat more negative than their attitudes toward gay men and lesbians (Herek, 2002b). Instead, homosexual adults' greater visibility probably makes them more vulnerable to discrimination in workplace and housing settings, compared with bisexuals. Additional data collected in the present study suggest that bisexual men and women are less likely than gay men and lesbians to disclose their sexual orientation to others in a variety of social contexts, including the workplace. In addition, to the extent that homosex- ual adults are more likely than bisexuals to cohabit with a same-sex partner (because many coupled bisexuals have a different-sex partner), the former are probably more readily labeled as gay by landlords and realtors and thus are more subject to discrimination. As noted above, comparisons of prevalence estimates across previous studies are problematic because of differences in sampling strategies, ques- tion wording, time frames, and data reporting conventions. Estimates of lifetime victimization from the present data are higher than those reported in some published studies (e.g., D'Augelli & Grossman, 2001; Herek et al., 1999) but lower than in others (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2001). The 70 difference between the current study and the KFF survey may be due to the fact that the latter was conducted only with urban residents, who are more likely than nonurban residents to experience crime of all sorts (Herek & Sims, 2007). Differences between the present study and those conducted by D'Augelli and Grossman (2001) and Herek et al. (1999) may result from the latter's use of convenience samples whose representativeness cannot be deter- mined; the current data probably provide a more accurate estimate of the extent of victimization experiences within the sexual minority population. The current study's estimates of the extent of felt stigma in the sexual minor- ity population are another unique contribution. About 55% of respondents man- ifested some degree of felt stigma. It tended to be higher among respondents who had experienced enactments of stigma. For criminal victimization and employment discrimination, this pattern was mainly due to significant differ- ences among lesbians and bisexual men who had experienced enacted stigma versus those who had not. Because the data reported here are retrospective and cross-sectional, the causal and temporal direction of these relationships, if any, cannot be determined. Experiencing enacted stigma is likely to increase an indi- vidual's subjective sense of vulnerability related to her and his sexual orienta- tion (Herek et al., 1999), which could result in a positive correlation between enacted and felt stigma. However, other explanations for the pattern are also plausible. For example, persons with high levels of felt stigma may have a heightened sensitivity to the occurrence of stigma enactments and consequently may be more likely than others to attribute ambiguous incidents to stigma. Previous research on the cognitive strategies used by sexual minority crime vic- tims for assessing their attackers' motives, however, suggests that relatively unambiguous cues (e.g., antigay verbal abuse) often accompany hate crimes based on sexual orientation (Herek, Cogan, & Gillis, 2002). Despite the methodological advance represented by its use of a national probability sample, the present study has limitations. The data reported here may not accurately describe the experiences of sexual minority members of the KN panel who did not disclose their sexual orientation in response to the initial screening question. Moreover, the questions about victimization were brief and presented in a quasi-checklist format. This approach, which was necessitated by the limited resources available for the present study, did not permit detailed assessment of specific incidents nor did it provide respondents with extensive memory cues (e.g., questions about the date and types of vic- timization in each incident) to assist them in accurately recalling their experi- ences with stigma. Whereas experiences with dramatic enactments of stigma, such as serious assaults, are not likely to be forgotten, relatively mundane episodes may be more difficult to recall (Herek, Gillis, Cogan, & Glunt, 1997). 71 In future research, therefore, it will be important to replicate the present find- ings using more detailed queries about the events surrounding each experience of enacted stigma, and to provide respondents with a variety of memory aids to maximize the accuracy of their self-reports. In addition, as with any probability sample, some error due to sampling can be assumed to be associated with the present data. The great advantage of the use of a probability sample is that, in contrast to convenience samples, sampling error can be quantified and expressed in the form of con- fidence intervals. Nevertheless, other sources of error may also affect the data. As with most modern surveys, for example, the initial sampling frame excluded U.S. households without a telephone as well as group living quar- ters (e.g., barracks and dormitories). These limitations to the sample cover- age should be kept in mind when interpreting the data. In addition, measurement error may have resulted from the specific wording of the sur- vey questions or from other factors such as the order in which questions were presented. As with all surveys, the data represent a snapshot of the population at the time the study was fielded (autumn of 2005). For these reasons, more studies with national probability samples are needed. Even in the absence of additional surveys with probability samples, however, the present data have important policy implications. They demon- strate that the experience of violence and property crime is disturbingly widespread among sexual minority adults, especially gay men. Thus, they highlight the ongoing need for criminal justice programs to prevent and deter such crimes, and the need for victim services that will help to allevi- ate the physical, economic, social, and psychological consequences of such crimes (e.g., Herek et al., 1999; Herek & Sims, 2007). In addition, the psychological toll of antigay hate crimes and harassment should be considered by mental health professionals and by researchers conducting studies of psychological distress and well being in this popula- tion. Some research, for example, suggests that individuals who have engaged in homosexual behavior may be at greater risk than exclusively heterosexual adults for some forms of psychological distress (Herek & Garnets, 2007). Most studies, however, have not assessed how experiences of victimization and harassment might explain this pattern (for an excep- tion, see Mays & Cochran, 2001). Given the association between antigay victimization and heightened psychological distress (Herek et al., 1999) and the present study's finding that such victimization has been experi- enced by roughly one in eight lesbians and bisexuals, and nearly 4 gay men in 10, it seems likely that the associations observed in past research between sexual orientation and psychological problems are attributable, at 72 least in part, to such victimization. Moreover, the fact that more than half of the respondents in the present study experienced some degree of felt stigma related to their sexual orientation further highlights the extent to which sexual minorities are subjected to stressors that heterosexuals do not experience (e.g., Meyer, 2003). Ever since the Hate Crimes Statistics Act became law in 1990, marking the federal government's first official recognition of the problem of violence and crime against people because of their sexual orientation, researchers have attempted to document the extent and prevalence of antigay victimiza- tion. The present study makes an important contribution to this effort. Such data can assist law enforcement agencies, service providers, and sexual minority communities in alleviating and preventing the problems created by sexual stigma. Notes 1. This is the one study cited by Berrill (1992) that was based on a probability sample. 2. Design weights were computed to account for the following: (a) variations among respondents in the number of adults in the household, (b) variations in the number of telephone lines in the household, (c) undersampling of telephone numbers for which matching addresses could not be obtained, (d) oversampling of Black and Hispanic populations, (e) oversampling of households with personal computers and Internet access, (f) undersampling of households in areas not covered by MSN Web TV, (g) slight overrepresentation of Chicago and Los Angeles where early pilot testing for the panel was conducted, (h) oversampling of the four most populous states (CA, NY, FL, TX) and central regional states early in the life of the panel.

Syracuse University reported 12 hate and bias incidents on campus in 2019, according to the university's annual safety and security report released Tuesday. Of the 12 incidents, nine involved property damage and three involved intimidation. The university also reported one bias-related aggravated assault and one intimidation incident on public property. #NotAgainSU, a movement led by Black students, protested the more than 30racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic incidents that occurred at or near SU starting in November 2019. The bias and hate incidents reported in 2019 show a dramatic increase from previous years. In 2018, the university reported two intimidation incidents on campus. The university also reported 10 rapes and five reports of fondling on campus in 2019, the same number of offenses as the previous year. Dating violence offenses on campus increased by two, with eight reported incidents on campus in 2019. The number of stalking incidents reported on campus decreased to eight, two less than 2018.Burglaries, motor vehicle theft and arson reports all decreased from 2018. There were seven burglaries, three vehicle thefts and no arson reports in 2019. Aggravated assault and robberies reported in 2019 both remained the same as 2018, with two reports of each. Drug and liquor law violations also continued to decrease in 2019. The university reported two drug law violation arrests and 71 disciplinary referrals from drug violations in 2019. SU reported 440 liquor law violations that all resulted in disciplinary action. SU also reported one disciplinary referral for possession of an illegal weapon. SU reported no crimes at its New York City, Washington D.C., Los Angeles andinternational campuses. https://donate.dailyorange.com/ The post 12 hate crimes, bias incidents reported on SU campus in 2019, new data says[2] appeared first on The Daily Orange[3].

New national data reveals deadliest year on record for hate crimes, even as fewer agencies reported data
ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today called on Congress and law enforcement agencies across the U.S. to improve data collection and reporting of hate crimes in response to newly released FBI data for 2019. The data reveals a harrowing trend of increasing hate crimes being reported in the United States, even as fewer law enforcement agencies provided data to the FBI.
The FBI's annual Hate Crime Statistics Act (HCSA) report reveals that 2019 was the deadliest year on record with 51 hate crime murders a 113-percent increase over the previous record of 24 set in 2018. Total hate crime incidents rose to 7,314, marking the fourth increase in the past five years. After declining in 2018, religion-based hate crimes increased by 7 percent, with 63 percent of the total number of reported religion-based hate crimes directed at Jews and Jewish institutions.
""When one individual is targeted by a hate crime, it hurts the whole communitythat's why people are feeling vulnerable and afraid,"" said ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt. ""We urge Congress to immediately pass the Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act to improve hate crime training, prevention, reporting and best practices.""
For 2019, the FBI reported:
Race-based hate crimes remained the most common type of hate crime, as has been the case every year since the FBI began reporting hate crime data nearly three decades ago. Constituting over 50 percent of all hate crimes, race-based hate crimes underscore the importance of the national conversation aimed at countering systemic anti-Black racism.
A 14-percent increase in anti-Jewish hate crimes, from 835 in 2018 to 953 in 2019; 63 percent of the total reported religion-based crimes were directed against Jews and Jewish institutions.
Anti-Hispanic hate crimes rose nearly 9 percent, the fourth straight year of escalating numbers. This is a trend not unrelated to the escalation of anti-immigrant rhetoric, bigotry, and dehumanization in the public discourse.
After a 41-percent increase in 2018, hate crimes targeting individuals based on gender identity rose another 18 percent last year.
The increase in reported hate crimes comes despite the fact that, for the second straight year, the number of law enforcement agencies providing data to the FBI has declined. The FBI's annual report has consistently provided the most comprehensive snapshot of bias-motivated criminal activity in the United States, but there has long existed a reporting gap that underrepresents the true number of hate crimes that occur.
The FBI's report is based on voluntary local law enforcement reporting to the Bureau. In 2019, 86 percent of participating agencies didn't report a single hate crime to the FBI, including at least 71 cities with populations over 100,000. Just over 2,000, or 14 percent, of the more than 15,000 participating agencies actively reported at least one hate crime.
""The total severity of the impact and damage caused by hate crimes cannot be fully measured without complete participation in the FBI's data collection process,"" Greenblatt said. ""We are working with our partners to improve hate crime data reporting. While some of the increase in 2019 may be the product of better reporting in some jurisdictions, it is critical to improve training at local law enforcement agencies across the country. We also need to remove the barriers that too often prevent people in marginalized communities the individuals most likely to suffer hate crimes from reporting hate-based incidents in the first instance. In this pivotal moment in our national conversation about the importance of justice for communities of color, religious minorities, and the LGBTQ+ community, we must make combating hate crimes a top priority.""
ADL has updated its interactive hate crime map to reflect the most recent FBI data. The map includes links to every hate crime law on the books in the U.S. and FBI hate crime data from 2004-2019 for all 50 states and for cities with more than 100,000 residents. The map gives users the ability to explore hate crime laws, as well as hate crime data, broken down by targeted, protected characteristics at the national, statewide, and city level.

Rose Joins Bipartisan Call for Department of Justice Action on Anti-Asian Hate Crimes and Discrimination",FALSE,"Rep. Max Rose, D-New York, issued the following news release:
Congressman Max Rose, who has strongly condemned discrimination against the Asian American community throughout the coronavirus pandemic, joined a bipartisan group of 150 Members of Congress in calling for the Attorney General to take action and publicly condemn discrimination and violence toward Asian Americans.
""The hate, violence, harassment and discrimination that has been hurled upon those in the Asian American community is gut-wrenching, horrible and wrong,"" Rose said. ""I hear from families and seniors that they're afraid to leave their homes, business owners forced to shut down, and far too many who have been victim to street attacks, verbal assaults, or racist fliers. It has no place in our community and we all must stand strong in solidarity against it. I'm proud to see so many of my colleagues join together from both parties to strongly condemn these actions, now the Administration must join the chorus.""
Since the beginning of the crisis, there have been numerous reports of Asian Americans being threatened, harassed, or assaulted. As of June 3, the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council reported 2,066 incidents of coronavirus-related discrimination. As a result, these communities, in addition to working to combat the coronavirus, are left fighting an additional front--that of hate and injustice.
""We write to draw particular attention to an increase in verbal and physical attacks as well as discrimination towards Asian Americans who have been wrongly blamed for the virus' spread,"" wrote Rose and the bipartisan Members of Congress in a letter to Attorney General William Barr. ""We respectfully request that you publicly condemn acts of anti-Asian bias, and provide us with regular status updates regarding the steps the Department of Justice is taking and will take going forward to combat this behavior.""
Rose is a co-sponsor of the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which was introduced by fellow New York City Congressmember Grace Meng. The legislation seeks to provide greater federal government oversight of COVID-19 hate crimes, and require the Department of Justice to provide Congress with regular updates on the status of reported bias incidents.
Last month, Rose and local elected officials from South Brooklyn hosted a roundtable with Chinese-American business owners and community leaders to discuss efforts to support small businesses and the community through the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including against rising xenophobia and discrimination.

July 20, 2020
To: The Honorable William P. Barr, Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice, 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20530
Dear Attorney General Barr:
Thank you for featuring the quote ""Coronavirus is no excuse for hate"" on the Department of Justice's hate crimes website. The COVID-19 pandemic affects all Americans and has wrought enormous pain in the United States./1
Some Americans are facing increased discrimination as a result of the pandemic. We write to draw particular attention to an increase in verbal and physical attacks as well as discrimination towards Asian Americans who have been wrongly blamed for the virus' spread. We respectfully request that you publicly condemn acts of anti-Asian bias, and provide us with regular status updates regarding the steps the Department of Justice is taking and will take going forward to combat this behavior.
Asian Americans are not responsible for the spread of coronavirus in the United States; yet, since the start of the pandemic they have experienced continued harassment, violence, and discrimination. As of June 3, the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council reported 2,066 incidents of coronavirus-related discrimination./2
These and numerous news reports have documented cases ranging from the denial of services at stores to verbal harassment on the subway to physical assaults.
In one particularly egregious instance, an individual in Texas stabbed three Asian Americans, two of whom were children, because he thought they were infecting others with COVID-19. In March, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Houston field office acknowledged the likelihood of a surge in hate crime incidents against Asian Americans./3
And most recently, a new Ipsos survey conducted for the Center for Public Integrity found that more than 30 percent of Americans have witnessed someone blaming Asian people for the coronavirus pandemic./4
We appreciate the op-ed the Department placed in the Washington Examiner generally stating that hate crimes will be investigated and prosecuted./5
However, the dangers faced by the Asian American community today are very real and deserve a strong and specific response by our government. In fact, on May 8, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights acknowledged its concerns ""over the increase in xenophobic animosity toward Asian Americans (and perceived Asian Americans) as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic"" and unanimously issued recommendations urging federal agencies reduce this sentiment./6
We note that in the early 2000s during the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak, the Bush Administration immediately took steps to prevent discrimination against Asian Americans by creating a community outreach team to monitor and document acts of anti-Asian bias and engage with the community.
Two years earlier following the September 11 terrorist attacks, the Administration had similarly sought to prevent attacks against Arab, Muslim, Sikh, and South Asian American communities by engaging with community leaders, conducting coordinated civil rights enforcement, and speaking out forcefully./7
While these prior responses were not perfect, they represented an important effort to acknowledge and address the specific discrimination.
Despite the fear present within the community, each and every day Asian Americans help to combat COVID-19. While Asian Americans comprise 7 percent of the U.S. population, 17.1 percent of active medical physicians are Asian American./8
Similarly, Asian Americans are serving our country by working as nurses, health aides, and in many other essential occupations. Asian Americans are just as American as any other group of people in our country.
We respectfully request that you, as head of the Department of Justice, forcefully condemn anti-Asian bias to send an unambiguous message to all Americans that discrimination against this community is un-American and will not be tolerated. Further, we would ask that you update us regularly as to what steps the Department has taken to address our concerns. Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

The CAREN Act would also make it illegal for people to contact law enforcement solely to discriminate on the basis of gender, sexuality or religion
It comes after numerous high-profile instances in which women dubbed 'Karens' have been caught calling the police to report bogus crimes
Two San Francisco lawmakers have a proposed a bill which would make it a hate crime to call 911 to file a false report against a person of color. 
Shamann Walton and Matt Haney, who both serve on the city's Board of Supervisors, announced their plans to push through the legislation on Tuesday. 
The pair have called their proposal the Caution Against Racially Exploitative Non-Emergences Act, or the CAREN Act. 
The acronym is a play on the name Karen - which has recently become used as a slang term for a white woman who is perceived to be entitled, demanding or racist.
While filing a false police report is already a crime, the CAREN Act would add a 'hate crime' extension to the offence, according to The Daily Beast. 
The CAREN Act would also make it illegal for people to contact law enforcement solely to discriminate on the basis of a person's religious affiliation, gender, sexual orientation or gender identity', according to a press release. 
Announcing the proposal on Twitter, Walton wrote: 'Racist 911 calls are unacceptable that's why I'm introducing the CAREN Act at today's SF Board of Supervisors meeting. This is the CAREN we need.'
Walsh, who represents San Francisco's 6th District, also took to Twitter to declare that he had co-authored the bill. 
'The CAREN Act makes it unlawful to fabricate false racially biased emergency reports. Racist false reports put people in danger and waste resources.,'' he wrote. 
In the past two months there have been a number of high-profile incidents involving so-called 'Karens' calling the cops on people of color and accuse them of bogus offences. 
Back in May, New York investment banker Amy Cooper was branded 'Central Park Karen' after she was caught on cell phone video calling 911 and falsely claiming that she was being threatened by black bird-watcher Christian Cooper (no relation). 
Mr Cooper had simply asked Ms Cooper to put her dog on a leash. 
While on the phone to the 911 operator, Cooper was seen adopting a hysterical tone, demanding that officers respond immediately. 
'I'm in the Ramble, there is a man, African-American, he has a bicycle helmet and he is recording me and threatening me and my dog,' she stated. 
'I am being threatened by a man in the Ramble, please send the cops immediately!' 
Ms Cooper was charged with falsely reporting an incident in the third degree on Monday.
If the CAREN Act becomes law in San Francisco, any similar incidents that occurs in the city could lead to the filing of a hate crime charge against the individual who dials 911. 
However, it is unclear whether the law would extend to people who call to report trivial issues or minor disputes with persons of color to police. 
Last month in San Francisco, white businesswoman Lisa Alexander dialed 911 on Fillipino man James Juanillo after she stopped to question him while he was chalking 'Black Lives Matter' onto a fence outside his home. 
Juanillo claims that after Alexander called police about his alleged illegal activity, cops came by in a squad car, but never even got out 
Alexander was quickly dubbed 'San Francisco Karen' - but its unclear whether she would be charged with a hate crime under the CAREN Act as she did not report a false incident, but rather a trivial one. 
The board of supervisors has not yet voted on whether to pass the Act, "

The pictures he posted - which nearly got him kicked out of school - were of a retired police captain who was recently killed by looters, and one of him holding an AR-15. His posts prompted a hateful reaction from intolerant 'keyboard warriors' who despise the police and the Second Amendment. Fordham University officials then opened an investigation and charged him with intimidation, making threats, disorderly conduct, and a hate crime - all for posting a picture of himself with a lawfully purchased and owned firearm and one of a slain police officer. 
Now he has been banned from campus, asked to write a letter of apology, and told he must complete implicit bias and multicultural sensitivity training in order to graduate with his degree. Today is the deadline for Austin to make his decision. He plans on saying no. And, if the university wants to kick him out, he says they're going to have a legal fight on their hands. Stories similar to Mr. Tong's are happening all over America. The NRA will stand and fight for every citizen's rights. Please considerjoining[2]ordonating[3]today to support Mr. Tong, and the NRA cause. Here are five quick questions and answers from new NRA member Austin Tong. You were born in China and immigrated to the United States. How did that happen? America is the land of opportunity and I think everyone around the world knows that. My parents, who came first, wanted to make a better life for themselves and their family. They knew America was a free country and people come here because of everything the country has to offer. That's why we moved to New York. Have you always been interested in firearms? I've always had an interest, mostly thanks to video games, but I never really thought about buying one before. But after recent events I thought it would be a good way to keep me and my family safe. I'll admit I wasn't always a believer, but as time went on, I began to appreciate the rights we have as Americans more and more. And that's how I got into trouble - because I expressed that appreciation. What was it like to receive a midnight visit from the Fordham Safety Officers? Well, I posted the pictures, received the backlash, and a few hours later received a call from the officers saying they were a few minutes away and wanted to talk. I looked out my door and saw them standing outside my home. One came in and one stayed with the car. It was basically about 20 minutes of questions about the firearm, why I posted the pictures, and what I was trying to say. I'm a good guy, a good person, so while I was a little shook by the visit I knew I'd done nothing wrong. I knew people would probably criticize the post, but I wasn't expecting the level of backlash, the death threats, the calls for expulsion, or that the entire school would get involved. I was shocked, appalled, and disappointed. But I didn't do anything wrong and that's why, if they carry through with their threats, we're going to sue. We've read about the horrible comments you received, including the death threats, but have all the reactions been negative? No, not at all. There were a ton of nasty comments after the initial post but once the word really got out, where the NRA really helped a lot, I started hearing from the media, other Instagramers, and people from the firearm community. That's why I'm doing this. At first this was my case by now I think of it as the country's. I don't know what's going to happen when I don't comply with Fordham's demands. I don't' know what's going to happen to my future but after receiving all those messages from people around the country and around the world - people from all backgrounds and political parties - I knew I had to do more. They were telling me their stories, similar stories, how they were silenced or too scared to share their stories. That should never happen - not here in America. That's why I'm doing this. That's why I'm standing up. When there's no free speech then America isn't America anymore. That's what drives me. It's empowering what the NRA did, what people across the country have done, and I think we'll have a great case for protecting free speech. Did the reaction from Fordham officials surprise you? It did because the guy who charged me, the dean of students, he knows me. And the safety officers said I wasn't a threat or being intimidating. They said there's nothing wrong with me yet they're still trying to kick me out of school. I'm shocked and surprised because they know me. They know who I am. And I expected more from this esteemed university. About NRA-ILA: Established in 1975, the Institute for Legislative Action (ILA) is the 'lobbying' arm of the National Rifle Association of America.

Inertia on hate crimes in several state legislatures is prompting municipal leaders to initiate ordinances that punish those who commit crimes driven by prejudice. The recently passed hate crime law in Little Rock is the latest example.
Mayor Frank Scott Jr. said he hopes the comprehensive measure, adopted July 8, will push Arkansas' legislature to finally adopt a hate crimes statute. Arkansas is one of only three states without laws to adequately prosecute offenders who target someone based on race, religion, sexual orientation, or other protected categories.
In South Carolina, where a white supremacist murdered nine African Americans inside Charleston's Emanuel AME Church, federal authorities charged the killer with hate crimes when the state could not.
In Wyoming, where Matthew Shepard, a gay college student, was beaten, tortured, and left to die, hate crimes are classified as misdemeanors. Shepard's murder inspired an expansion of the federal hate crime law to include a victim's perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.
The U.S. House has adopted and Senate is considering the National Opposition to Hate, Assaults and Threats to Equality (NO HATE) Act, which aims to provide resources to adequately track and prosecute hate crimes in all 50 states.
The bipartisan bill would improve hate crime reporting with grants to empower state and local governments to train law enforcement, create reporting hotlines, direct resources to minority communities and conduct public educational forums. Local law enforcement agencies would be required to submit hate crimes data to the FBI.
But the NO HATE Act cannot take the place of state laws. Arkansas, South Carolina, and Wyoming need to join the other 47 states and distinguish crimes driven by prejudice and charge them as felonies. We must not wait until the next murder.
Unfortunately, so far, that has been the case. Earlier this summer, Georgia passed a hate crime law after Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Black jogger, was fatally shot by two white men while another filmed the slaying.
The Little Rock law also followed a horrific death. Trevone Miller was charged this month with capital murder in the death of Brayla Stone, a transgender teenager from North Little Rock.
The Little Rock ordinance covers what a comprehensive hate crime law should. It increases penalties specifically for crimes targeting people based on their race, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability. It aims, as the law states, to recognize that those offenses ""strike special fear within victimized groups, fragment communities, and tear at the very fabric of our democratic way of life.""
Arkansas lawmakers have drafted a hate crime bill ahead of the 2021 legislative session. But previous measures failed to pass. Meanwhile, the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, the New Aryan Empire, and at least a dozen other extremist groups, call Arkansas home.
In South Carolina, where hate crime bills have stalled in the statehouse for years, FBI statistics showed 111 hate crimes reported in 2018, the most recent year of available data. The numbers are much lower in Wyoming. But a recent investigation by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights has uncovered that anecdotal accounts of hate crimes contradict the low numbers because there is no incentive for agencies to keep track.
AJC's landmark survey on antisemitism last year revealed that 75 percent of American Jews targeted by an antisemitic attack or remark didn't report the incident. If they did, only 3 percent told police. The NO HATE Act offers the incentives and assurance to minority communities that concerns about their safety are counted on a national scale, which could encourage more reporting of incidents.
Fortunately, mayors and municipalities have tried to fill the void. Atlanta, as well as other cities and counties, had local ordinances on the books before the Georgia bill passed. South Carolina's three largest cities Greenville, Charleston, and Columbia have citywide hate crime laws.
Not all hate crime laws are equal or adequate. Indiana and South Dakota laws don't include the LGBTQ community as a protected category.
But Indiana's law came just in time. On July 4, Vauhxx Booker, a civil rights activist, was seeking a spot along a southern Indiana lakefront to admire a lunar eclipse when he was accosted by two white men who pinned him against a tree, spat in his face, and shouted racial slurs. One of them wore a cowboy hat with a Confederate flag. The other threatened to get a noose. One of Booker's friends caught the crime on video.
The FBI is investigating whether to charge the men with a hate crime. But even if they don't, Indiana now has that option. Arkansas, Wyoming, and South Carolina need to catch up.

David Nelson and Nicole Anderson are each charged with three misdemeanor counts, including violation of civil rights, vandalism, and possession of tools to commit vandalism or graffiti, the district attorney's office said in a statement. The incident happened soon after the mural was painted in front of the courthouse in Martinez, California, on July 4.
""We must address the root and byproduct of systemic racism in our country. The Black Lives Matter movement is an important civil rights cause that deserves all of our attention,"" District Attorney Diana Becton said in a statement.
""The mural completed last weekend was a peaceful and powerful way to communicate the importance of Black lives in Contra Costa County and the country,"" she said. ""We must continue to elevate discussions and actually listen to one another in an effort to heal our community and country.""
When reached by phone by CNN, Nelson, 53, said ""I have no comment -- for you anyway."" CNN's attempts to reach Anderson, 42, went unanswered Tuesday night.
A woman, wearing a red T-shirt and flip-flops, began painting over the yellow-lettered mural with black paint Saturday, as seen in a video posted on YouTube and shared in a police statement. A man wearing a red Trump shirt that read ""Four more years"" began filming as the woman started painting.
""We're sick of this narrative, that's what's wrong,"" the man said in the video. ""The narrative of police brutality, the narrative of oppression, the narrative of racism, it's a lie.""
A bystander off camera can be heard arguing with the man. She asked what was wrong with him before adding, ""This is racist, what you're doing.""
Residents of Martinez got a permit from the city to paint a Black Lives Matter mural on July 4, Martinez Police Chief Manjit Sappal said in a statement.
Police had been looking for the man and woman seen in the video.
""It appeared that the couple came to the mural with cans of paint and a roller with the specific purpose of vandalizing over the mural,"" Sappal said in the statement. ""The community spent a considerable amount of time painting this mural only to have the suspects destroy it by dumping and rolling paint over part of the message.""
During the incident, the woman stopped painting to voice her concern, suggesting such murals be kept in New York. ""This is not happening in my town,"" she said.
The mural was repainted after the incident, according to CNN affiliate KPIX. The area was blocked off and the mural was surrounded by chalk images as of Sunday afternoon, KPIX reported.
In an unrelated incident Sunday, a man was arrested for shouting ""all lives matter"" and pulling a gun on a young man looking at the same Black Lives Matter mural, according to CNN affiliate KGO.
Nelson and Anderson will be sent notices to appear in court. That date has not yet been released, according to DA spokesman Scott Alonso. If convicted of the misdemeanor charges, each defendant could face up to a year in county jail, according to the news release."

Hundreds of attacks on Asian people have been reported, with few signs of decline.
 Asian Americans in California reported 832 incidents of discrimination and harassment in the last three months, according to the new data collected by ""Stop Asian American Pacific Islander Hate,"" the leading aggregator of incidents against Asian Americans during the pandemic.
 The incidents included 81 assaults and 64 potential civil rights violations.
 The new report released on Wednesday by Stop AAPI Hate shows that incidents of racism and discrimination are not isolated to any particular area but are a statewide problem in California as Asian Americans have reported incidents in 34 counties so far in the most populous state of the United States, adding that incidents are reportedly taking place in California in retail stores, in the workplace and online.
 ""Anti-Asian American harassment has also been further stoked by President Trump's repeated use of the term 'Kung Flu' in recent rallies, and as recently as last night, comments on Twitter scapegoating China for the United States' devastating failure to control the coronavirus,"" said the group in a statement.
 They noted that discrimination and harassment of Asian Americans in California has drawn national attention recently after a series of videos in Torrance, California featured a woman using graphic racist language against Asian Americans.
 ""The viral video of racism in Torrance is one example of hundreds. It's the tip of the iceberg of anti-Asian American hate and discrimination,"" said Russell Jeung, chair and professor of Asian American Studies at San Francisco State University. ""Without government accountability, we risk COVID-related racism against Asian Americans becoming deeply entrenched, ultimately impacting the lives of millions of people in California and around the country.""
 ""Racist demagoguery matched with anti-immigrant policies have always been used to deny Asian Americans full social and political rights,"" said Cynthia Choi, co-executive director of Chinese for Affirmative Action.
 ""In California, we have to do more than condemn racist rhetoric – we must take bold action today to address attacks whether they happen in grocery stores, in the workplace or in the schoolyard,"" Choi added.
 Stop AAPI Hate sent a letter to California governor Gavin Newsom Tuesday night to recommend the establishment of a Racial Bias Strike Team comprised of key state agencies and departments to oversee workplace and employment discrimination, provide mental health services to vulnerable communities, and offer support to local Asian American-serving organizations.
 Meanwhile, Asian Americans in New York have been helping themselves confronted with the increase of targeted hate crimes by equipped themselves with GoPros and guns.
 When Eddie Song leaves his Manhattan home, it can feel like heading into battle. The Korean American startup founder and avid rider dons his armored motorcycle jacket, motorcycle gloves, a skull face mask and a GoPro camera.
 ""The GoPro is on all the time whenever I leave the house now. Basically it's a rolling camera,"" Song said. ""With the combination of looking intimidating and having the camera – if they pick a fight with me, they know I'm prepared.""
 During the pandemic, an online hate reporting center has received nearly 1,500 reports of racist abuse against Asians nationwide since it launched March 19. Stay-at-home orders mean in-person run-ins are down somewhat but vandalism of Asian-owned homes and businesses is up, according to the advocacy groups running the portal.
 It's difficult to predict whether incidents will dramatically drop once society goes back to ""normal,"" Levin, a former NYPD officer, said, noting that the pandemic is unprecedented.
 ""Generally, when there's a catalytic event, hate crimes tend to decline and have a bit of a half-life,"" he said. ""But that presupposes a singular catalytic event as opposed to a rolling one."""

The research centre noted that an anti-Latino mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, last August, which left 22 people dead, was the most deadly single hate homicide event since FBI tallies began in the 1990s.
The overall number of hate crimes in 2019 hit their highest level in over a decade, the centre said.

""We found hope and a sense of belonging in each other. That's the America that we love and, four years later, that is what our campaign is about,"" Biden said about the Indian diaspora living in the US.
Biden said, if elected, he will make public college and university tuition free for families making less than $125,000 a year, and help more Indian American families generate wealth and equity through a first-time home buyer's credit worth up to $15,000.

The unexpected passage Tuesday of HB 426, Georgia's Hate Crimes Bill was a big win for the state and for Episcopalians who have fought for the measure, The Right Rev. Rob Wright said in a statement issued after legislators approved the legislation.
""I am thankful to those who supported this much needed affirmation that hate has no place in Georgia. Our state's citizens deserve a hate crimes bill that affirms equal treatment under the law.
""As a follower of Jesus, I condemn hate driven actions of all stripe. Whether they be violence against our brothers and sisters of color or our LGBTQ brothers and sisters or our Jewish and Muslim siblings who adhere to a faith in the same God I honor and worship.
""Now is the time for all people of good will to continue the heart and mind work that is needed for all citizens to be seen as worthwhile and beloved members of society.""
Earlier, Wright and other board members of the Georgia Interfaith Public Policy Center had joined individuals, business leaders and civil rights groups in supporting the measure. GIPPC issued a statement decrying hate crimes and calling for Georgia to leave the list of four states not outlawing hate crimes.
The hate crime bill, which enhances the penalties for crimes motivated by the race, sexual orientation, or religion of the victims, passed Tuesday by wide margins in both houses of the Georgia legislature. It was an outcome that seemed unlikely just a few days earlier.
The bill had languished in a Senate committee without a hearing for more than a year. Then, after the outcry over the slaying of Ahmaud Arbery in Brunswick and other Black men and women including Rayshard Brooks in Atlanta a hearing was set for last Friday.
The bill was approved by the committee in a party line vote with a ""poison pill"" amendment adding police officers and other first responders to the list of those protected. It took a late-night bipartisan agreement on Monday that moved the law enforcement provision to another bill to clear the way for the vote putting Georgia on the list of 47 states that have a hate crimes law.
Bishop Wright has been a leader in working for racial and ethnic healing since being consecrated Bishop of Atlanta in 2012.
Along with Episcopal Church Presiding Bishop Michael Curry, Wright in 2017, established the Absalom Jones Center for Racial Healing. The Center is now a worldwide resource for those seeking ways to heal longstanding rifts between races.

A Trump-supporting California couple has been charged with hate crimes after they painted over a sanctioned Black Lives Matter mural with black paint. 
Nicole Anderson, 42, and David Nelson, 53, were charged by the Contra Costa County District Attorney's Office with three misdemeanor counts, including a hate crime. 
They were captured on video on July 4 defacing a Black Lives Matter mural in Martinez by painting over it with black paint. 
Anderson is seen in the footage using a large paint roller to paint over the letters 'B' and 'L' in the word Black, which had been painted yellow. 
According to the district attorney's office, a Martinez resident applied for a permit to paint the temporary mural in front of the city's Wakefield Taylor Courthouse on July 1. The permit was approved by Martinez city officials and the painting took place on July 4. 
Nelson and Anderson arrived at the scene of the mural after it was completed with paint supplies. Video of them has been shared widely on social media. 
A telephone number for the couple was disconnected when DailyMail.com tried to contact them Wednesday morning and a Facebook page for Anderson is said to have been deactivated. Nelson told CNN: 'I have no comment - for you anyway.'
'We must address the root and byproduct of systemic racism in our country. The Black Lives Matter movement is an important civil rights cause that deserves all of our attention,' Contra Costa County District Attorney Diana Becton said. 
'The mural completed last weekend was a peaceful and powerful way to communicate the importance of Black lives in Contra Costa County and the country. We must continue to elevate discussions and actually listen to one another in an effort to heal our community and country.'
Both Nelson and Anderson are charged with violation of civil rights, vandalism under $400 and possession of tools to commit vandalism or graffiti. 
If convicted, both defendants face up to a year in county jail. The alleged offenses are exempt from a specific bail amount due to the current county bail schedule in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In footage from witnesses, Nelson was seen wearing Trump-supporting attire as he argued with witnesses. 
Footage shows the woman pouring a can of black paint over part of the mural and using a paint roller to cover the bright yellow letters.
Records obtained by The Smoking Gun show that in March 2004 Anderson filed for a domestic violence protection order against Nelson and was handed a three-year restraining order. 
When one witness asks the woman 'what's wrong with you,' her male companion replies 'we're sick of the narrative, that's what is wrong'.
'The narrative of police brutality, the narrative of oppression, the narrative of racism, it's a lie,' the man adds. 
The man, who was recording the incident, then points to the Black Lives Matter sign and calls it 'racism'.
An argument is sparked between the man and onlookers while the woman continues to damage the mural.
'There is no oppression. There is no racism,' the man says. 'It's a leftist lie...from the media.'
The woman then becomes enraged at the witnesses and exclaims 'keep that s****' in f****** New York! It's not happening in my town!' 
The woman appeared to referencing to a number of Black Lives Matter murals approved across all five boroughs of New York City.
Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that one would be painted directly in front of Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue - a move that angered the president - but it was delayed last week for unspecified reasons. 
Several such murals have painted on roadways across the country to show solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement after the killing of George Floyd and other black Americans at the hands of law enforcement. 
At one point, the man chimes in that 'no one wants Black Lives Matter here' and 'all lives matter.'
The Martinez Police Department said that it dispatched to the Black Lives Matter mural after people reported the incident, but the couple had already fled the area. 
Community members on Sunday returned to the mural and re-painted it. 
'The community spent a considerable amount of time putting the mural together only to have it painted over in a hateful and senseless manner,' the department said. 
'The City of Martinez values tolerance and the damage to the mural was divisive and hurtful. Please help us identify those that are responsible for this crime, so they can be held accountable for their actions.'
More than 100 people - all wearing face coverings and adhering to social distancing - gathered to paint the phrase on Saturday for five hours. 
The 'public art project,' was organized by a local group named Martizians for Black Lives, which got permission for the mural from the Martinez Recreation Department.
Justin Gomez, a top organizer for Martizians for Black Lives, said the project was inspired after a number of anti-Black Lives Matter fliers were discovered in the city. 
The fliers reportedly prompted a community-wide discussion and reflection of how residents should be treated.
'People have now seen racism in their community; now we have to confront it,' said Gomez.
He added that it was not mistake that the mural was placed in front of the Martinez courthouse.
The legal system 'gateway to mass incarceration' that has disproportionately affected Black Americans and minorities, as well as perpetuated institutional racism.
'The system is made up of millions of little systems. We have to look locally first,' said Gomez.
One of the mural artists, Tatiana Ray, told ABC 7 that the couple's response to the artwork was indicative of white supremacy permeating through American culture.
'I think that this is an indication of how much power white supremacy actually has,' she said.
'The fact that even having something on the street for one hour, they couldn't even tolerate that. You know, it was such a threat to have anybody else's concerns represented by the city and represented by the community.'
Nationwide protests against white supremacy, racial injustice and police brutality have gripped the United States since George Floyd's death on Memorial Day.
The first Black Lives Matter mural was painted in Washington, DC, near the White House last month. 
Murals for the movement soon started popping up in major cities like New York City where multiple murals have been painted in Manhattan and Brooklyn. 
In Maryland, artists created a Breonna Taylor mural to call for justice for the 26-year-old EMT who was fatally shot by Louisville Metro Police Department officers on March 13. 
As hundreds of thousands of Americans continue to call for action, President Donald Trump has railed against Black Lives Matter protesters and unequivocally sided with law enforcement. 
He was condemned over his heavy-handed military response to often peaceful protests, appearing to incite further divide between civilians using prejudice rhetoric and for using the widely contested phrase 'when the looting starts, the shooting starts'.
His apparent distaste for Black Lives Matter protesters seeped into his Fourth of July address at the White House, where he compared them to Nazis and terrorists.
'American heroes defeated the Nazis, dethroned the fascists toppled the communists, saved American values, upheld American principles, and chased down terrorists to the very ends of the earth,' he said. "

Ordinarily, there would be nothing wrong with that, but nowadays, the liberal agenda always has to add something more. In this case, it's the frustratingly clichd closeted gay friend plot, this time with bonus white male bigots.The third episode 'Dear Hope' follows our main character Bess (Bethany O'Grady) as she tries to write a song about hope for a writing contest. 
Unfortunately for her, the day she's writing her song happens to be a pretty sour one. Most notably, her good friend Prisha (Shalini Bathini) is caught making out with a girl namedAnanya in the middle of the park. This comes as a shock to Bess, who didn't know about Prisha's relationship, but it's quickly interrupted by two men. Being white and male, they immediately harass her for being a lesbian minority, because this is what we are told happens every day in Trump's America.Man: Send em back. Terrorist dykes, go home!Bess: Prisha! Prisha! The situation grows worse since Prisha is forced to go to the hospital for stitches and meets up with her traditional Indian parents who have no idea about her orientation. For their sake, the girls hide Prisha's relationship, but her parents still seem pretty quick to understand that two white men randomly attacked Prisha in the middle of New York City.Vilina: Where is she? Where is my daughter? What did they do to you?Anil: Where's the doctor?Prisha: It's okay.Anil: Where is the doctor?Anil: It's okay. It's okay.Bess: The doctor came. They did a CAT scan.Vilina: So, who did this? What happened?Ananya: It was these-Prisha: Two crazy racists.Anil: Racists? Did the police catch them? Did you file a report, or-Prisha: We filed a report, but they didn't catch them.Vilina: Why would anyone want to hurt you? Are you alright, sweetie?Bess: This is Ananya, Mama G.Ananya: We-Prish: She's in the band with me. That's why she was there. Because she's in the band.Vilina: Ananya, do you want me to call your mother?Ananya: You don't need to call her. She's got enough she's dealing with.Vilina: Look what this country has done to our beautiful daughter.Prisha: MamaAnil: Vilina, don't get upset.Doctor: The family's arrived, I see. Prisha later states her parents sacrificed everything to give her a life in America. Apparently, it wasn't worth it. After all, if New York City is filled with white men ready to throw bottles at women of color for being lesbians, there isn't any hope for the rest of us unwashed masses. Or at least that's what this show would have us believe.On top of all that, her parents readily believe Prisha would have been attacked in broad daylight for simply being brown in ""this country."" One would think after the Jussie Smollett case[1] blew up in the media's face that the left would be less apt to go with that narrative. Sadly, it seems like almost every show is willing to die on the 'white man bad[2]' hill.By the end of the episode, Prisha still hasn't come out to her parents, so we can probably be sure this will come up again. It's a shame since otherwise the series would just be a simple dull drama with a few too many f-bombs. Now it's a ridiculous dull drama with a stupid agenda, which is far, far worse.

According to the latest crime statistics, there were almost five hundred shooting arrests last month — which represented a 112 per cent rise on the same period last year — and some 115 shootings, which had also risen 112 per cent on last year.
The New York Police Department (NYPD ) said in a statement that the increase in shootings “presented significant public safety challenges”, while the city also responded to the Covid-19 pandemic, placing strain on police department resources. 
“As shootings continued their upward trajectory in November, citywide shooting incidents through the first eleven months of 2020 surged to levels unseen in years,” the statement added. 
This year alone, the department has recorded over 1,4000 shootings, which was 95.8 per cent higher than that seen between January and November last year. 
The NYPD said 40 per cent of those accused of a shooting so far this year, have previously been arrested for gun possession. 
At the same time, some 21 per cent of shooting victims were also said to have had a previous arrest for gun possession. 
While “shootings have victimised far too many,“ the police department said. “Going forward, the NYPD will continue to cultivate information to arrest anyone willing to purchase, carry or sell an illegal firearm in New York City.”
Responding to the release of the crime statistics on Friday, New York City mayor Bill de Blasio said increases in certain crimes were because public spaces were closed, in addition to economic troubles, amid the Covid-19 pandemic, ABC New York reported.
Homicides were also higher last month than at the same time last year, and have risen by 38 per cent on the previous year. 
Hate crimes, however, were said to be “dramatically down” on the same month last year, with overall crime having flatlined so far this year, according to NYPD statistics. 
“Even as the pandemic prompted a spike in coronavirus-related hate crimes against those of Asian descent, it was swiftly addressed by the formation of an Asian Hate Crime Task Force that has so far helped to close 16 of 24 of those reported crimes with an arrest,” the department said. 
“Whatever the challenge, our NYPD officers have shown innovation and determination to get the job done this year,” NYPD Police Commissioner Dermot Shea added.

Forty percent of hate crime complaints are recorded improperly or downgraded, according to a report published recently by New Zealand police department.
Juliet Moses, a spokesperson for the New Zealand Jewish Council responded to the report findings, said that while further training was still clearly needed, the new system of recording hate crimes was nevertheless an improvement: ""It is very important that if something does constitute a criminal offense it is recorded as such and acted on appropriately so that people aren't walking around without being held to account.""
""The point of this is that these crimes are monitored, so that we have better evidence, and we understand what is going on in the community, and obviously can act on that accordingly,"" Moses added.
Police have started working with advocacy and community groups to improve their system. According to the report, forty-three percent of hate crimes recorded by the police are downgraded to lower-level crimes.
Police in New Zealand only started recognizing hate crimes last year, as a response to the Christchurch terror attack in March 2019. The new protocol requires police to log hate crimes in the National Intelligence Application (NIA) database and in the police's dispatch system database. However, the report noted that even with the new system in place, crimes are not properly logged.

American Jewish Committee, the leading global Jewish advocacy organization, warned today that the continuing rise in hate crimes incidents targeting Jews in the United States is a threat to society that demands urgent national attention.
While Jews account for less than 2% of the American population, the new FBI Hate Crimes Statistics report found that more than 60% of religious-based hate crimes in 2019 targeted Jews, an increase of 14% over 2018.
The annual FBI report is only a partial rendering of the scope of hate crimes, since it depends on voluntary submissions of data from local law enforcement agencies. In the new report, 71 cities with a population of 100,000 residents or more incredulously reported zero hate crimes or did not submit any data for the year 2019.
""American Jews are worried about antisemitism in this country and the release of the FBI's Hate Crimes report will provide them with little comfort."" said Daniel Elbaum, AJC Chief Advocacy Officer. ""Our nation's failure to internalize this fact, as evidenced by AJC's groundbreaking surveys on antisemitism in America, harms not only the Jewish community, but it threatens the essence of our democracy and pluralistic society.""
The FBI report comes only three weeks after AJC issued its groundbreaking report on The State of Antisemitism in America. A stunning 76% of American Jews said they do not even report the antisemitism they experience, according to the AJC report.
AJC found that nearly nine in ten American Jews (88%) believe antisemitism in the U.S. today is a very serious (37%) or somewhat of a (51%) problem, and more than four out of every five Jews (82%) say antisemitism has increased over the past five years.
The FBI report shows a total of 7,314 hate crime incidents in 2019, up by nearly 3% from the 7,120 incidents reported in 2018. Total religious-based incidents increased by 7%, from 1,419 in 2018 to 1,521 in 2019. Incidents targeting Jews were up 14 percent, 953 in 2019, compared to 835 in 2018. Moreover, in 2019, Jews were the victims in six of the 12 religious-bias murders reported in 2019.
Among the actions AJC has been urging is adoption by Congress of the NO HATE ACT, which among other provisions will mandate hate crimes reporting to the FBI. ""More accurate reporting will enable law enforcement agencies to develop effective strategies to combat antisemitic hate incidents and crimes,"" said Elbaum. ""Congressional action, before the current session ends, is imperative."""

""What has been happening in the past few months in terms of skyrocketing hate crimes and xenophobia against the Chinese- and Asian-American community as a result of COVID is not only disgusting, it's reprehensible and must utilize every tool at the federal, state, and city level to crack down on it,"" Rose said. ""As we talk about the economy, there's no secret that restaurants owned by Asian-Americans were some of the first to shut down. They need our help and I'm continuing to fight to ensure they have the relief and help they need and deserve.""
During the roundtable, Rose announced his support and co-sponsorship of the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which was introduced by fellow New York City Congressmember Grace Meng. The legislation seeks to provide greater federal government oversight of COVID-19 hate crimes, and require the Department of Justice (DOJ) to provide Congress with regular updates on the status of reported bias incidents.
Since the beginning of the crisis, there have been numerous reports of Asian-Americans being threatened, harassed, or assaulted. The pandemic has also fueled a rise in anti-Semitic incidents against the Jewish community, and has had adverse impacts on the LGBTQ community. As a result, these communities, in addition to working to combat the coronavirus, are left fighting an additional front--that of hate and injustice.
Rose has continued to fight for and prioritize the needs of small businesses. Earlier this month, the bipartisan Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act, which Rose co-sponsored, was signed into law and included many critical fixes for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). Following Congress passing additional funding for relief programs to help businesses and nonprofits, Rose called on four of the leading banks to prioritize the truly small businesses that are hurting most over larger corporations and businesses. Rose also testified before the House Committee on Small Business urging more safeguards to ensure federal funding goes to small and minority-owned businesses and nonprofits that need them most.

On June 27 the New York State Bar Association’s (NYSBA) House of Delegates met virtually, concluding the second part of its summer meeting, discussed reports produced by several task forces, sections and committees.
The New York Law Journal quoted NYSBA President Scott M. Karson in a story about the House of Delegates approving a report from the Task Force on Domestic Terrorism and Hate Crimes, which recommended adding hate crimes to the list of offenses that allow for eavesdropping and video surveillance warrants.
“Why not define a hate crime as one which is eligible for eavesdropping? [It] makes more sense than to try to juggle the preexisting crime to fit the eavesdropping statute,” said Scott Karson, the association’s president, in an interview Monday.
The New York Law Journal quoted Karson in a story discussing the goals and objectives of the Attorney Well-Being Task Force, a new task force initiative that will be a centerpiece of his term as president.
Karson, the newly installed president of the NYSBA—he took over June 1—said that he had thought for months about wanting to make lawyer well-being and health a centerpiece of his time as president, if he were to get the position.
“Studies have shown rates of mental illness, fatigue, physical health problems, and substance use for attorneys that far exceed the national averages for other professions,” Karson said in a recent statement announcing the NYSBA’s initiative. “We need to eliminate the stigma associated with mental health treatment and make it easier for all lawyers to seek out the help that they need,” he added."

CAIR-NY identified the victim as Tarek Elsayed, an 18-year-old Egyptian-American.
The teen was attacked in Staten Island by a neighbor over a parking dispute, a police source told CNN.
The man punctured Elsayed's rear passenger tire and struck him with a baseball bat when he got out of his car to check the damage, CAIR-NY said in a statement.

Elsayed told CNN that he believes he told police about the epithets.

CNN business editor at large Richard Quest joins us now.
So, Richard, can the EU do this and how would they do it?
RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR AT LARGE: They can absolutely do it, in the same way that the United States banned travel from Europe at the middle of March. So, yes, they have the power to do it. Will they do it? The latest thinking is, yes, they will. And the reason is because of the numbers.
The EU is using the trend of new cases, the 14-day trend of new cases. And countries have to be at the same level as the EU or better.
Now, if you look -- as you look at that chart, according to diplomats, the EU has roughly six to eight per hundred thousand population. The United States has over 100 per 100,000 of the population. And as the chart makes clear, it's actually rising in the U.S.
So the EU is basically saying, why would we let travelers from the United States come to Europe when we know that the situation in the U.S. is getting worse, not better? Will some European countries, like Spain or Italy or Greece and France that have large-scale U.S. tourism, they might negotiate around this.
But the EU has suffered too much pain over this to simply fritter it away, is my understanding, and they'll hold firm. It seems to be the U.S. will be told that it's not on the list of countries eligible to travel to the EU, but it will be reviewed every 14 days.

Well, Beijing is reporting its lowest number of new coronavirus cases since it shut down a food market linked to an outbreak earlier this month. Just seven new infections were reported in China's capital on Tuesday, a dozen across the main land. I mean minuscule numbers although, of course, China has had questions about how well they report their numbers in the past.
HARLOW: For sure. This comes as China is says that it has conducted over 90 million tests for Covid since the pandemic started.
CNN's David Culver gives us a first-hand look at one of Beijing's biggest testing sites.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Here in China, you're looking at one of many mass testing sites that have been set up, particularly within Beijing.
[09:35:01]
This is following the wholesale food cluster outbreak that happened more than a week ago. They say it's now under control, but they are continuing testing in massive numbers.
And you've got here 19 rows set up. This is for 19 different communities that feed into this one mass testing site. Once people have registered, they're taken across this little way here into these lines. And let me show you where they end up. It's almost like getting in rides at an amusement park. They're getting in line there, if you will.
I'll show you. Follow me over here. And this is where the actual testing is done. It takes about 30 seconds. You've got about 100 staff members that work on two-hour shifts. And there they do the throat swab. They then then take that sample and they'll put it in a refrigerator. And then move on to the next person. Usually it takes just a few days' time to get the results back and most people are only notified if they have a positive result.
You can see over here, this is where the staff will take off all of their PPE. All of their protective equipment. And they'll throw it away. It's kept in a safe, separate area.
And the other staff that are about ready to come on shift, they get changed, suited up and go through a sanitation procedure in a separate facility to then keep this going really from 9:00 in the morning until 10:00 at night. In three days' time that this has been operating, they've done about 20,000 tests. This was built overnight, so they pop up relatively quickly.
They will keep it going for as long as they need to here within Beijing. And they say, as of now, they feel like they're on a good path in keeping this most recent cluster outbreak under control. But they are saying complacency is what they're trying to avoid with all of this.

SCIUTTO: It's the day after primary day in some key states and still some primary races yet to be called. New York and Kentucky, many votes, including mail-in ballots, yet to be counted. New York Congressman Eliot Engel, who has served in the House for more than 30 years, he's fighting for his political future against a progressive newcomer. Perhaps, Poppy, a sign of the times.
HARLOW: Totally. And the recent protests surrounding police brutality shook up the Democratic Senate primary race in Kentucky.
Let's bring in our political correspondent, MJ Lee, and senior Washington correspondent Jeff Zeleny.
MJ, let me begin with you.
Eliot Engel, you know, 30 plus years, serving, obviously, chair of a very important committee, fighting for his political career.
MJ LEE, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: That's right. And, you know if Engel does end up losing to Jamaal Bowman, I think the big narrative coming out of this race is going to be that the New Yorkers in the 16th Congressional Direct wanted to vote for change.
You know, I spent some time with Congressman Engel and Jamaal Bowman last week as they were doing their last-minute campaigning and spending time with Bowman, it was noticeable that he often said to votes, it is time for a change.
You know, Poppy, as you noted, Congressman Engel is somebody who has been in Congress for 31 years. He is in his 16th term right now. He is the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. So, obviously, has a lot of seniority and experience.
However, what he has gotten heat for recently is the fact that he wasn't in his home district particularly when Covid-19 was really ravaging his district. Remember, his district includes New Rochelle. This is where we saw sort of that first hot spot in New York.
And when I asked him last week, why did you spend that time in your Maryland home instead of being home in New York, he said, you know, this is a phony issue. Why does it matter where I am? I was quarantining in my Maryland home because it's bigger and because this is where my wife and I could quarantine together. Voters don't care about this.
Well, actually, it turns out some voters do care about where their congressman is and just feeling like they don't take their seat for granted and feeling like they are very engaged. And I think this is why we have seen some parallels being made in this race to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and when she ousted Congressman Joe Crowley. Obviously, she said at the time, when she was running against him, he is more Washington than New York.
SCIUTTO: All right, Jeff Zeleny in Kentucky, this is a remarkable rate, right, because the Democratic Party highly recruited Amy McGrath specifically to challenge Mitch McConnell. Thought they had everything they wanted, needed there. Raised $14 million, as you noted yesterday. And now you have Representative Charles Booker, I mean, running neck and neck the day after the primary vote.
What happened there and where does it stand?
JEFF ZELENY, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's not that it's too close to call. We don't know that yet. The ballots are still being counted. And, again, this race, like the one MJ was talking about in New York, also deeply influenced by the coronavirus. First and foremost, had this election been underway on May 19th, when it was scheduled, Amy McGrath almost certainly would have won. But this race has changed dramatically in the last month because of protests. And we've seen nationwide protests.
But here in Louisville, a police officer was just fired overnight because of the killing of Breonna Taylor. This has been a central issue to this race. And it is something that Charles Booker talked about again and again. And Amy McGrath was the hand-picked favorite of the Democratic establishment. She still is. But she stumbled over her reaction to protests.
So what we have now is Amy McGrath is leading with the votes that were counted so far, but those are largely in rural Kentucky. So the cities here in Louisville, as well as in Lexington, that is what is going to be key here in terms of absentee and vote by mail. So we may not know the results of this election until next week.
[09:45:03]
One thing is clear, Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate majority leader, he, of course, won handily last night. He's trying to win his seventh (ph) seat. What he doesn't know this morning is who he'll be running against.
Jim and Poppy.
HARLOW: Yes.
And before we go, I'd be remiss not to mention, MJ, North Carolina and the 24-year-old newcomer, Madison Cawthorn, defeating Lynda Bennett, someone who had been endorsed not only by the president, but by Mark Meadows as well. Tell us about him. I mean he has a remarkable story.
LEE: He does. And, as you said, you know, the reason this is sort of a nationally fascinating story is because Lynda Bennett had gotten President Trump's endorsement, Mark Meadows' endorsement.
But he does have a very compelling personal story. He was in a very serious car accident a few years ago. He is paralyzed from the waist down. He is in a wheelchair. And he is incredibly young. You know, he is only going to be 25 years old at the time that he takes office, if he does win. And this is going to be interesting nationally because President Trump so far had a very good track record in the candidates that he endorsed, winning in this cycle. So, in this case, that was not -- that was not what we saw last night.
SCIUTTO: MJ Lee, Jeff Zeleny, thanks to both of you. I know we'll come back to you as we learn more.
Other story we're following, Nascar driver Bubba Wallace, he has spoken to CNN, this after the FBI investigated and they say the noose found in his garage stall this weekend was actually not left for him.
[09:51:00]
SCIUTTO: So, the FBI investigated. They determined that Bubba Wallace was not the target of a hate crime and now the Nascar driver is speaking out.
HARLOW: Yes. A powerful interview from him this morning. Federal investigators say while the rope that was found in his garage stall was a noose, they say it -- they -- was not a noose, they say it was there for months and it was used as a garage pull.
Let's go to our Nick Valencia. He joins us from Talladega in Lincoln, Alabama.
HARLOW: You know, I do think it's notable, you know, because there's been a lot of -- a lot of people weighing in with opinions on this. You know, it was the head of Nascar, Nick, that came to Bubba Wallace, right, and said, look, we found this. The head of Nascar was in tears over it. It, you know, just for facts base there.
SCIUTTO: Right.
NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Bubba Wallace says, in his own words, that he's pissed because some in the American public are questioning his integrity. Some going so far as to say that he manufactured this hoax. And the DOJ and FBI saying that no hate crime occurred. But Bubba Wallace released a statement only after the Nascar president told him that he was the victim of a hate crime. And we should also be clear, and Bubba Wallace was very clear in his interview this morning on ""NEW DAY"" that he never saw the noose. In fact, it was a member of his team that saw it and was so concerned that they brought it to the attention of Nascar.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BUBBA WALLACE, NASCAR DRIVER: I have never seen a noose personally in my life. I've seen a lot of garage pulls. We've had a lot of garages growing up, racing out of and we simply had a tiny knot at the bottom of it to pull and nowadays you just press a button and the garage goes down. But, yes, it was, in fact, a noose, as a garage pull. So there are two sides of it and both are true and correct.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
VALENCIA: Video posted on YouTube in 2019 shows a picture of that noose, as it's described by Bubba Wallace, in the same garage that he used and Nascar saying that there's no way anyone could have known that he was going to use that garage number four when he showed here at Talladega to race.
We should mention very quickly there, Jim and Poppy, that Nascar has been criticized for what people say are jumping the gun in this hyper- charged environment. They are speaking out as well this morning saying that they are committed to providing an inclusive environment not just for their fans but also for their drivers.
Jim. Poppy.
HARLOW: Nick, thanks a lot.
The boys of summer will start playing later this summer. Major League Baseball says a shortened season will begin in one month.
Jim.
SCIUTTO: Yes, CNN's Coy Wire joins us now to explain.
Listen, ugly negotiations, no question. Still -- still lingering questions about what would happen if there's another outbreak on a team or a number of teams.
COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: That's a great question, Jim. Also, how are your Mets going to do? Twenty-two to one odds to win the World Series.
SCIUTTO: Thank you.
WIRE: The Minnesota Twin, Poppy, 15-1.
HARLOW: Thank you.
WIRE: A sign that we might actually have baseball back.
But, yes, players, Jim and Poppy, set to report to their hometown team facilities for camp by July 1st, one week from today. Many seem to be very excited about this. MLB and the Players Association agreeing to their extensive health and safety protocols for a return to play plan last night. Those include things like pitchers carrying wet rags so they don't have to lick their fingers, no spitting on the field, and a separate coronavirus injured list for players who test positive.
And will there be -- there will be just 60 regular season games and they're going to start, as Poppy mentioned, July 23rd or 24th according to league commissioner, Rob Manfred, with teams looking to be one of the 10 who make the playoffs.
Now, that's not a lot of games compared to the normal 162 that they get to reach playoff form. Keep in mind, the champion Washington Nationals last year had the third worst record in the national league after just 60 games.
But the threat of coronavirus still remains. To Jim's point, the Phillies saying that two more players and two more staff members have tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of positive tests for the team to 12. And three Colorado Rockies players testing positive for the coronavirus last week according to multiple reports.
[09:55:06]
Several Rockies players have been taking batting practice and working out at the team's stadium in Denver this month according to ""The Denver Post."" So, yes, great news for fans to have baseball set to return, but can teams effectively contain positive cases to prevent an outbreak?
SCIUTTO: Yes.
WIRE: Remember, the Orlando Pride, Jim and Poppy, announced Monday that they're withdrawing for the National Women's Soccer League month- long tournament after too many of the members on their team tested positive for coronavirus.
HARLOW: Yes.
SCIUTTO: Yes, and do some athletes say it's not worth the risk, right? I mean, you know, the risk of getting sick. Do they sit out the season?
Well, listen, we hope they play and we hope the Mets and the Twins are in the World Series.
Thank you, Coy Wire.
HARLOW: No doubt about who would win that one.
Thanks, Coy.

December 8, 2020
This piece originally appeared in the Aspen Institute blogs.
In his famous letter to the Jews of Newport, George Washington portrayed a United States that ""gives to bigotry no sanction and to persecution no assistance,"" a place where those who dwell in the land ""merit and enjoy the good will of the other inhabitants."" In the ensuing 230 years, America has taken great strides towards fulfilling this aspiration. However, with injustice and inequality at the forefront of public discourse, the persistent rise in hate crimes serves as another stark reminder that the work remains unfinished.
Each year the FBI gathers data about hate crimes from thousands of law enforcement agencies across the country and publishes statistics about the previous year. The report just released shows that in 2019 hate crimes reached their highest occurrence in over a decade, an increase of 2.7% since 2018. 2019 also marks the worst year of hate-motivated murders (51) since the FBI began publishing statistics in 1995.
While the FBI report charts general trends, the data is notoriously incomplete. The FBI found 7,314 hate crimes in 2019, but the Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates an average closer to 250,000 incidents each year.
We know far less than we should, even as the rise in hate crimes erodes American social cohesion and jeopardizes our constitutional freedom of religious expression. Furthermore, massive underreporting stymies our response to a scourge against Americans of all backgrounds.
African American victims account for nearly half of all incidents based on race, but anti-white crimes constituted 16% of that total. At just 2% of the US population, Jews were the subject of an alarming 60% of anti-religious offenses. At the same time, antipathy towards Muslims, Sikhs, Catholics, and Protestants, as well as many other religious identities continue to motivate numerous threats and violence. Our fellow Americans have been targeted for their sexual orientation and gender identity, with gay men making up more than half of all victims in those categories. A rising tide may lift all boats, but rising hatred brings us all down.
Statistics alone do not convey the impact of these attacks. Among the victims of hate in 2019 were those killed in a kosher supermarket in Jersey City, Hasidic Jews stabbed in their rabbi's home in Monsey, NY, as they celebrated Hanukkah, and a woman killed during prayer in a synagogue in Poway, CA. Earlier in the same month, the Poway shooter set fire to a mosque in Escondido, CA, ""inspired"" by the murder of 51 Muslim worshippers in New Zealand. On a quiet Saturday morning in August, a terrorist entered a Walmart in El Paso to execute as many Latinos as he could, leaving 23 people dead, their families bereft, and a nation shaken. Each victim counts and all must be counted.
So why does ""massive underreporting"" persist?
Some victims stay silent, such as the 76% of Jews interviewed by American Jewish Committee who did not report antisemitism they had experienced. In other instances, local law enforcement lacks the training to recognize hate crimes. Additionally, even though the FBI is legally mandated to gather data on hate crimes, reporting by local law enforcement is voluntary. Each year tens of thousands of law enforcement agencies and scores of large cities across the country implausibly report zero hate crimes or simply do not submit information. Data drives resources, and without understanding the scope of the problem, we cannot create effective solutions.
To address the underreporting challenge, coalitions like the Muslim-Jewish Advisory Council are advocating for passage of the Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act, named for two victims whose killers were convicted of hate crimes that never made it into the FBI report. The bill allocates funds to train local law enforcement, create reporting hotlines, and increase resources to liaise with affected communities in all 50 states. It has passed in the House with significant bipartisan support, but advocacy is still needed in the Senate.
Washington's hopeful letter to the Jews of Newport noted that ""The reflection on the days of difficulty and danger which are past is rendered the more sweet, from a consciousness that they are succeeded by days of uncommon prosperity and security."" Let us commit to taking tangible action to usher in days of uncommon security for all Americans, that we might look at the alarming rise in hate crimes as a danger which has passed."

The commemoration also paid tribute to Rabbi Josef Neumann, who was stabbed during the attack, and died of his injuries months later after being attacked by 38-year-old Grafton Thomas. The perpetrator was arrested hours after the attack that took place in the house of Rabbi Chaim Rottenberg. Prior to his expected trial, he was found to be mentally unfit to stand for hate crime charges.

93,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1/Files (250).DOCX","The New York Times",2020-11-17,"732 words","Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 19","By Tim Arango",NA,"Hate Crimes At Highest Since 2008, F.B.I. Reports",FALSE,"An F.B.I. report on hate crimes also found that more murders motivated by hate were recorded in 2019 than in any year before.
Hate crimes in the United States rose to their highest level in more than a decade last year, while more murders motivated by hate were recorded than ever before, the F.B.I. said on Monday. 
 The sharp rise in homicides driven by hatred -- there were 51 last year, according to the F.B.I. -- was attributed in large part to the mass shooting in El Paso in August 2019. In that shooting, the authorities say a 21-year-old gunman motivated by hatred toward Latinos stormed a Walmart and killed 23 people and injured many more.
 The death toll in the El Paso attack more than doubled that of 2018's deadliest hate-motivated crime, the mass shooting targeting Jews at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.
 Over all, the F.B.I. collected data on 7,314 criminal incidents motivated by bias toward race or ethnicity or gender identity in 2019. It was the third straight year the metric surpassed 7,100 incidents and it was the highest number since the F.B.I. reported 7,783 incidents in 2008. Experts say the F.B.I. data likely undercounts the number of hate crimes in America, both because many victims fail to report incidents and local agencies are not required to report hate crime data to the F.B.I.
 For example, last year only 2,172 agencies reported hate crime data to the F.B.I., out of a total of more than 15,000 law enforcement agencies around the country, according to the F.B.I.'s report. (Notable omissions from the data in recent years have included the death of a protester in 2017 during a rally of white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va.)
 ''It's important to note that, because of the nature of hate crime reporting, the F.B.I.'s annual report vastly understates the real level of hate crimes in the country,'' the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups, said on Monday.
 The S.P.L.C. noted that the rise in hate crimes in recent years has come as the number of white supremacy groups has surged. According to data collected by the S.P.L.C., the number of white nationalist groups grew 55 percent between 2017 and 2019.
 The upswing in hate crimes last year underscored the upward trend in bias-motivated crimes during the Trump era, and the harsh rhetoric against Latino immigrants was seen as motivating the gunman in the El Paso shooting.
 ''Politics plays a role,'' said Brian Levin, a professor at California State University, San Bernardino, and the director of the university's Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism.
 ''The president's rhetoric has been identified in a series of actual attacks,'' Mr. Levin added, ''but moreover the day-by-day ticks of F.B.I. hate crimes shows there are increases after sustained and fervent remarks by the president that enter into an online feedback loop that also ends up in other discourses, both at the water cooler and on television.''
 The overall increase was fueled by a rise in attacks, in particular, against Hispanics and Jews. The F.B.I. reported 953 anti-Semitic hate crimes last year, a 14 percent increase from the previous year and the most since 2008, according to a report by California State University, San Bernardino, that analyzed the latest F.B.I. report and was published on Monday.
 Hate crimes directed at Latinos rose almost 9 percent, to 527 incidents last year from 485 incidents in 2018. At the same time, hate crimes against Black people fell to the lowest portion of all hate crimes since such data started to be collected by the F.B.I., although Black people were still far overrepresented in the statistics, according to Mr. Levin's report. Last year, hate crimes targeting Black people fell slightly, by less than 1 percent.
 ''Blacks are still the No. 1 target, at twice the level they represent in the American population,'' the report said.
 In examining preliminary data from 2020, Mr. Levin found overall declines in hate crimes, which he explained as a result of social distancing measures and business closures from the coronavirus pandemic, except in three cities: Los Angeles, Houston and San Antonio. He has also found increases in bias crimes this year against two groups in particular, transgender people and Asian-Americans; the latter, he said, was most likely affected by anti-Asian animus provoked by false claims about the pandemic.

Good morning. I'm Warren Murray, bringing you the news hot off the press of a button.
Donald Trump has admitted he played down the Covid-19 pandemic, claiming that he did not want to create panic. On 7 February he told the journalist Bob Woodward in a phone call that coronavirus was ""more deadly than even your strenuous flus"". But by 27 February he was telling the public: ""It's going to disappear. One day - it's like a miracle - it will disappear."" The president admitted to Woodward in March: ""I wanted to always play it down. I still like playing it down, because I don't want to create a panic.""
The Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, reacted to the reports by saying: ""He knew how deadly it was. It was much more deadly than the flu. He knew and purposely played it down. Worse, he lied to the American people. He knowingly and willingly lied about the threat it posed to the country for months ... he failed to do his job, on purpose. It was a life and death betrayal of the American people. Experts say that if he'd acted just one week sooner 36,000 people would have been saved.""

 No Covid shot so try a moonshot - Boris Johnson believes a mass testing programme is ""our only hope for avoiding a second national lockdown before a vaccine"", according to leaked official documents setting out plans for ""Operation Moonshot"", which would deliver up to 10m tests a day even though the current testing regime is struggling to deliver a fraction of that number. The test-and-trace system will not function unless ministers boost statutory sick pay (SSP) so workers can afford to stay at home, the head of the TUC has said. Millions of low-paid workers either do not qualify for the statutory sick pay of £95.85 a week or could not live on it. Keep up on coronavirus developments at our global live blog.

 China envoy Twitter porn storm - China's UK embassy has demanded Twitter make a ""thorough"" investigation after its ambassador's account liked a pornographic post. The embassy claimed Liu Xiaoming's account had been ""viciously attacked"" after it liked posts critical of the Chinese Communist party and a 10-second video of a sex act. The likes remained active for at least an hour and were widely commented on before the pornographic tweet was unliked, and then later the others. Some hours later a spokesman for the London embassy released a statement: ""Recently some anti-China elements viciously attacked ambassador Liu Xiaoming's Twitter account and employed despicable methods to deceive the public. The Chinese embassy strongly condemns such abominable behaviour.""

 'Make misogyny a hate crime' - A couple who were victims of a violent homophobic attack on a London bus are calling for misogyny to become a hate crime, as a report reveals women are three times more likely to experience sexual violence and threats than men. Melania Geymonat and her partner Chris were beaten up and robbed by a gang of young men after refusing to kiss.
They have joined forces with a former police chief, MPs, religious leaders and the charity Citizens UK to put pressure on the government to introduce the new law. Scotland has already begun the process of making misogyny a hate crime. The women said in a statement: ""In the wake of being subjected to a homophobic hate crime we have been looking to find ways to ensure that we prevent other, more vulnerable people, from having to go through the horrors we did.""

The Briefing coined ""rule of six"" for the Covid restrictions in our headline yesterday morning, and to hear the PM make it official, sending it rippling through the news ... well, in these times one lives for the small things. ""There goes Christmas"", the Mail laments today, as it calls the rule ""draconian"" and depicts ""Covid marshals"" who will help enforce the rules as an ""army of snoopers"".
The Telegraph is gloomy: ""Christmas to bring little cheer"" and the Times looks and sounds similar: ""PM fears threat to Christmas"". But as we've come to expect the Express casts Boris Johnson as Santa Claus rather than the Grinch: ""PM: Christmas can still be saved by daily tests"". That refers, of course, to what the Metro calls ""The £100bn Covid test moonshot"" and the Guardian portrays as ""PM's £100bn gamble to avoid second national lockdown"".
""Stick to new rules or Xmas is off"", the Mirror warns, and the Sun does all right with ""No Ho Ho"". And lastly the FT where Johnson is ""accused of Brexit nadir with threat to rewrite EU treaty"" - more on the reaction here.

The year so far has presented significant public safety challenges with gun violence continuing to afflict New Yorkers across the city. As shootings continued their upward trajectory in November, citywide shooting incidents through the first eleven months of 2020 surged to levels unseen in years.
That spike in street violence contrasts with the levels of overall crime remaining flat through the first 11 months of the year, or up a combined +0.6% (8,170 v. 8,120) in the seven major felony categories amid an ongoing COVID-19 outbreak that continues to strain the city and its police. And hate crimes, in particular, are dramatically down. Even as the pandemic prompted a spike in coronavirus-related hate crimes against those of Asian descent, it was swiftly addressed by the formation of an Asian Hate Crime Task Force that has so far helped to close 16 of 24 of those reported crimes with an arrest.
On gun violence, the NYPD's unrelenting work to suppress it goes on. The data to date shows that our officers' continued focus on making strong gun cases is increasingly taking hold.
Gun arrests for the month of November are up +112.3% (484 v. 228), driving a +22.2% increase in citywide gun arrests (3,793 v. 3,104) compared with the same period a year ago. Going forward, the NYPD will continue to cultivate information to arrest anyone willing to purchase, carry or sell an illegal firearm in New York City.
Still, shootings have victimized far too many. For November, there was a +112.5% (115 v. 51) increase in shootings citywide. And shootings have risen +95.8% (1,412 v. 721) through the first 11 months of 2020, compared with the same period last year. Notable in the gun violence is an emerging trend the NYPD is weaving into its precision-driven enforcement approach: 40% of those accused of a shooting have had a past gun possession arrest, while 21% of shooting victims have had one.
To serve those harmed - on both sides of the gun - our officers and citizens continue to build the kind of bonds that are essential to our shared sense of well-being. Our investigators, Neighborhood Coordination and Youth officers, as well as every uniformed officer on patrol, remain steadfast in achieving the kind of common good all New Yorkers demand.
On violent crime, homicides have also risen both for the month and the year. November saw 28 people murdered in the five boroughs, five more than were killed last November. So far in 2020, there has been a +38.4% increase (422 v. 305) in the number of victims murdered in New York City compared to last year.
""Whatever the challenge, our NYPD officers have shown innovation and determination to get the job done this year,"" said Police Commissioner Dermot Shea. ""Our work to reimagine the kind of policing New Yorkers deserve is always evolving, in line with our agency's best traditions to reflect the needs of everyone in our city.""

SILBER AND EVAN BERNSTEIN",NA,"A present danger to Jews",FALSE,"At sunset tonight starts Rosh Hashanah, the beginning of the holiest time of the year for the Jewish people. As two leaders of community security initiatives charged with protecting the Jewish community, we are on our highest level of alert and gravely concerned about the safety and security of our beloved communal institutions.
Our alarm is shared. Last month, in a joint intelligence bulletin released by the National Counterterrorism Center, FBI and Department of Homeland Security, ""Threat of Terrorism and Hate Crimes Against Jewish Communities in the United States,""had as its key judgment: ""While faith-based communities across the country face varying levels of discrimination, there is a persistent threat of violence and hate crimes against Jewish communities, primarily by domestic violent extremists.""
This comes on the heels of 2019, which saw an unprecedented rise in anti-Semitic incidents. Over the past two years, America's Jewish community has been subject to violent and deadly attacks by lone actors who spent hours in online spaces steeped in a hodgepodge of government conspiracies, mass immigration replacement theories and hatred of Jews - some mobilized by white supremacy, others by fringe Black Israelite ideology and some by more typical anti-Semitism. The most deadly have sought to be glamorized as heroes and join an army of would-be copycat apocalyptic race war soldiers to advance their cosmic struggle, as we tragically witnessed in Pittsburgh in 2018 and Poway, Jersey City and Monsey in 2019.
As one of our former colleagues, the assistant commissioner for intelligence analysis at the NYPD, Rebecca Weiner, argued in a recent issue of Foreign Affairs, ""Just as they have for food delivery services and videoconferencing platforms, lockdowns have proved to be a time of growth and opportunity for white supremacists. Indeed, violent extremists across the ideological spectrum have exploited the pandemic to take advantage of people who are at their most vulnerable..."" Combined with the wild spread of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories blaming the Jews for the pandemic, all of the warning signals are blinking red.
The U.S. government is doing far too little regarding homegrown extremists and over the last few years, law enforcement has been slow to respond.
What should be done?
Increase government fundingfor security. Congress appropriated $90 million for the Non-Profit Security Grant program for fiscal year 2020 and a number of states have established similar programs. The federal government and states should significantly increase this funding, institutional security training and outreach. While New York State's security grant program for nonprofits is a model that other states should follow, decisions regarding 2020 award winners should be made as soon as possible.
Improve hate crime laws and data collection. According to the most recent FBI data, 85 cities with populations above 100,000 either did not report any data or affirmatively reported zero hate crimes to the FBI for its annual hate crime report. Data drives policy. We cannot address a problem if we are not effectively tracking and measuring it. Cities must be obligated to provide this vital data to the FBI.
Pass the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act. The law would enhance the federal government's efforts to prevent, report on, respond to and investigate acts of domestic terrorism by, among other things, authorizing three offices, one each within the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice and the FBI, to monitor, investigate and prosecute cases of domestic terrorism.
The FBI's most recent data says 58% of all religiously motivated hate crimes were directed at Jews - the highest number in decades. City, state and federal government must not only use their bully pulpits to more vehemently condemn hate, but must provide the resources and develop the tools needed to identify threats and prevent violent acts of domestic terrorism.

https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1eVtk7LT6CFGCHnoguF0DiLwKTXFpBgOF And here are the statistics for arrests for hate crimes by motivation: https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1T6aJEP6o9HVMdfQiRZ1aP240vUOpYsLg One has to be careful to draw direct conclusions from these. It is possible that blacks do not report anti-black graffiti nearly as often as Jews might report antisemitic graffiti, for example. But one cannot escape the impression that antisemitic incidents are downplayed compared to their frequency. Does this mean that there is systemic antisemitism in New York? I don't think so, but the word 'systemic' is being batted around a lot nowadays as if it is obvious, and these statistics indicate that antisemitism is more prevalent and widespread in New York than any other bias by any measure. In fact, anti-Jewish crimes come from all corners - some years there are more white attackers, some years more black ones. Last year 13% of the antisemitic crimes were done by Asians, but zero from Hispanics (who one would think would have identical grievances as Blacks do against Jews.) That is equal opportunity hate. And here's an amazing statistic: there more more arrests for anti-Muslim crimes than there were complaints over these three years: 42 complaints and 49 arrests. For Jews it was 579 complaints and 139 arrests. So it appears that the police take anti-Muslim crime very seriously, and anti-Jewish crime not nearly as much, the exact opposite of the impression one gets from the media. "
98,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1/Files (250).DOCX","The New York Times",2020-11-16,"774 words","US","Tim Arango",NA,"Hate Crimes in U.S. Rose to Highest Level in More Than a Decade in 2019",FALSE,"An F.B.I. report on hate crimes also found that more murders motivated by hate were recorded in 2019 than in any year before.
Hate crimes in the United States rose to their highest level in more than a decade last year, while more murders motivated by hate were recorded than ever before, the F.B.I. said on Monday.
The sharp rise in homicides driven by hatred — there were 51 last year, according to the F.B.I. — was attributed in large part to the mass shooting in El Paso in August 2019. In that shooting, the authorities say a 21-year-old gunman motivated by hatred toward Latinos stormed a Walmart and killed 23 people and injured many more.
The death toll in the El Paso attack more than doubled that of 2018’s deadliest hate-motivated crime, the mass shooting targeting Jews at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.
Over all, the F.B.I. collected data on 7,314 criminal incidents motivated by bias toward race or ethnicity or gender identity in 2019. It was the third straight year the metric surpassed 7,100 incidents and it was the highest number since the F.B.I. reported 7,783 incidents in 2008. Experts say the F.B.I. data likely undercounts the number of hate crimes in America, both because many victims fail to report incidents and local agencies are not required to report hate crime data to the F.B.I.
For example, last year only 2,172 agencies reported hate crime data to the F.B.I., out of a total of more than 15,000 law enforcement agencies around the country, according to the F.B.I.’s report. (Notable omissions from the data in recent years have included the death of a protester in 2017 during a rally of white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va.)
“It’s important to note that, because of the nature of hate crime reporting, the F.B.I.’s annual report vastly understates the real level of hate crimes in the country,” the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups, said on Monday.
The S.P.L.C. noted that the rise in hate crimes in recent years has come as the number of white supremacy groups has surged. According to data collected by the S.P.L.C., the number of white nationalist groups grew 55 percent between 2017 and 2019.
The upswing in hate crimes last year underscored the upward trend in bias-motivated crimes during the Trump era, and the harsh rhetoric against Latino immigrants was seen as motivating the gunman in the El Paso shooting.
“Politics plays a role,” said Brian Levin, a professor at California State University, San Bernardino, and the director of the university’s Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism.
“The president’s rhetoric has been identified in a series of actual attacks,” Mr. Levin added, “but moreover the day-by-day ticks of F.B.I. hate crimes shows there are increases after sustained and fervent remarks by the president that enter into an online feedback loop that also ends up in other discourses, both at the water cooler and on television.”
The overall increase was fueled by a rise in attacks, in particular, against Hispanics and Jews. The F.B.I. reported 953 anti-Semitic hate crimes last year, a 14 percent increase from the previous year and the most since 2008, according to a report by California State University, San Bernardino, that analyzed the latest F.B.I. report and was published on Monday.
Hate crimes directed at Latinos rose almost 9 percent, to 527 incidents last year from 485 incidents in 2018. At the same time, hate crimes against Black people fell to the lowest portion of all hate crimes since such data started to be collected by the F.B.I., although Black people were still far overrepresented in the statistics, according to Mr. Levin’s report. Last year, hate crimes targeting Black people fell slightly, by less than 1 percent.
“Blacks are still the No. 1 target, at twice the level they represent in the American population,” the report said.
In examining preliminary data from 2020, Mr. Levin found overall declines in hate crimes, which he explained as a result of social distancing measures and business closures from the coronavirus pandemic, except in three cities: Los Angeles, Houston and San Antonio. He has also found increases in bias crimes this year against two groups in particular, transgender people and Asian-Americans; the latter, he said, was most likely affected by anti-Asian animus provoked by false claims about the pandemic.

Rosen presented remarks highlighting the Department of Justices work combating anti-Semitic acts at a virtual conference hosted by Secretary of State Michael Pompeo entitled Ancient Hatred, Modern Mediumthe first ever government-sponsored event focused on online anti-Semitism. Deputy Attorney General Rosen described just a few of the Department of Justices many recent accomplishments in combating anti-Semitism, focusing on social media and the internet. His remarks as prepared for delivery are available here, and the full State Department conference may be viewed here.
Attorney General William Barr has emphasized that anti-Semitic acts, like other acts of violence motivated by hatred or bias, violate the personal security of individuals, threaten the freedom of communities to pursue their faith and way of life, and disregard the common ties that bind our Nation together. The Department is committed to combating anti-Jewish hatred on multiple fronts and in a multi-faceted approach, using both criminal and civil statutes. In this effort, federal law enforcement agencies work in conjunction with state law enforcement, local officials, and religious communities. In the last three years, the Department of Justice has worked to protect the rights of the Jewish community, and of all faith communities, through a variety of initiatives and engagements. In addition to those set out in todays remarks at the State Department conference, those include the following:
Summit on Combating Anti-Semitism
On July 15, 2019, at its headquarters, the Department of Justice held a Summit on Combating Anti-Semitism. The Summit brought together 150 leading members of the Jewish community and featured speeches by Attorney General Barr, Deputy Attorney General Rosen, FBI Director Christopher Wray, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Education Secretary Betsy Devos, Assistant Attorney General Beth Williams, Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband, and Special Envoy Elan Carr, as well as prosecutors, academics, and community activists. Speakers addressed the increase in anti-Semitic incidents on campuses, the balance between fighting anti-Semitic rhetoric while respecting First Amendment freedoms, and the Departments record in prosecuting hate crimes against Jews.
Attorney Generals Meeting with Religious Leaders in Brooklyn, New York
Attorney General Barr traveled to Brooklyn, New York on January 28, 2020 to meet with the heads of local Jewish community councils in areas of Brooklyn suffering from a spike in hate crimes against Jews, as well as heads of major Jewish organizations in the city. The Attorney General personally heard stories of how the Jewish community was affected by the hate crimes and exchanged ideas on how the Department could assist the community in responding to the spike. At the meeting, the Attorney General announced that in recognition of an increase in anti-Jewish hate crimes across the country, the Department would prioritize investigating and federally prosecuting these crimes, even those that would typically be prosecuted at the local level.
Attorney Generals Memorandum on Combating Anti-Semitism
In conjunction with his Brooklyn visit, Attorney General Barr issued a directive to all United States Attorneys directing them to initiate or reinvigorate contacts with the Jewish community in their respective districts to reassure the Jewish community of the Department of Justices commitment to protecting Jewish citizens. The memo directed the United States Attorneys to establish a point of contact in each of their offices for the Jewish community to report hate crimes or other discrimination. During the spring of 2020, United States Attorneys across the country met with Jewish clergy, local non-profits, and branches of national Jewish organizations.
Prosecutions of Anti-Semitic Hate Crimes
Since January 2017, the Department has charged more than 80 defendants with anti-Semitic hate crimes and related conduct, and has obtained convictions of more than 65 defendants for the same.
The Department, through the diligent work of its Civil Rights Division and U.S. Attorneys Offices around the country, has obtained convictions in a number of high-profile hate crime prosecutions affecting the Jewish community:
U.S. v. James FieldsThe United States Attorneys Office for the Western District of Virginia indicted James Fields for his August 12, 2017 deadly car attack at a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, which killed Heather Heyer and injured several other individuals. The defendant pleaded guilty to 29 federal hate crime charges and the Court sentenced him to 29 sentences of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, along with restitution.
U.S. v. Chadwick GrubbsThe United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Wisconsin charged the defendant with hate crimes for mailing letters to a Jewish community center threatening to attack the center with firearms and explosives. The defendant pleaded guilty to three federal hate crime charges and the Court sentenced him to 36 months imprisonment along with supervised release and fines.
U.S. v. Nolan BrewerThe United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Indiana charged the defendant for conspiring to attack an Indiana synagogue. The defendant pleaded guilty and the Court sentenced him to 36 months imprisonment.
Active cases the Department is currently prosecuting include the following:
U.S. v. Grafton ThomasThe United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York indicted Grafton Thomas for hate crimes after his December 28, 2019 machete attack against a rabbi and five others celebrating Hanukkah at the rabbis home.
U.S. v. Robert BowersThe United States Attorneys Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania indicted Robert Bowers for his October 27, 2018 armed massacre of 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
U.S. v. John EarnestThe United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of California indicted John Earnest for his April 27, 2019 fatal shooting at the Chabad of Poway Synagogue and for his attempted arson of a California mosque.
U.S. v. Tiffany HarrisThe United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York indicted Tiffany Harris for assaulting three Orthodox Jewish women during Hanukkah in December 2019 in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.
U.S. v. Ethan MelzerThe Counterterrorism Section of the National Security Division, along with the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York, indicted U.S. Army soldier Ethan Melzer for providing sensitive classified information about his unit to members of a Neo-Nazi group (whose core tenets include Holocaust denial), and urging them to disseminate the information to terrorists so that they could attack his fellow service members in Turkey.
Atomwaffen prosecutionsThe United States Attorneys Offices for the Western District of Washington, Middle District of Florida, Southern District of Texas, and District of Arizona, in coordination with the National Security Division, arrested multiple members of the white supremacist group Atomwaffen for making threats against African-American and Jewish journalists.
Supporting Religious Freedom including through the Place to Worship Initiative
On June 13, 2018, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the Place to Worship Initiative, which focuses on protecting the rights of religious individuals and communities to build, expand, buy, or rent houses of worship and other religious facilities as guaranteed by the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA). Since launching the initiative in 2018, the Civil Rights Division doubled the number of RLUIPA investigations to 15, up from an average seven a year since 2010. Cases involving the Jewish community include:
U.S. v. Borough of Woodcliff LakeThe Department filed a lawsuit alleging that the Borough of Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey violated RLUIPA when its zoning board denied zoning approval for the Valley Chabad to build a new place of worship on its land. This case was resolved in a settlement announced September 15, 2020, which will allow the congregation to build its facility.
U.S. v. Township of JacksonThe Department filed a lawsuit alleging that the Township of Jackson, New Jersey had taken various actions to stop yeshivas from locating in the Township.
Defending Constitutional Rights During the COVID-19 Pandemic
On April 27, 2020, Attorney General Barr directed the Department, including the Civil Rights Division and all United States Attorneys Offices, to review state and local policies to ensure that civil liberties are protected during the COVID-19 pandemic.
On June 19, 2020, pursuant to this initiative, the Department sent a letter to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio alerting him that the citys response to COVID-19 must respect the First Amendments protection of religious exercise. The Department urged Mayor de Blasio to reconsider his posture toward religious gatherings in the Jewish community and expressed concern over reports that the city sent police officers to break up numerous gatherings of the Jewish community in New York, including outdoor gatherings for funerals.
The Department continues to work to protect all communities of faith and will continue to take action when the constitutional rights of the Jewish community are infringed.
As Deputy Attorney General Rosen stated in his remarks at todays conference, the United States Department of Justice stands firmly and unequivocally against anti-Semitism. We will not hesitate to take action where anti-Semitic conduct rises to the level of a federal crime. That is as true online as it is offline. We have no tolerance for that behavior and will continue to prosecute such 2020 Legal Monitor Worldwide."

Three years ago, Darren Osbourne drove a van into a crowd of worshippers outside The Finsbury Park Mosque, killing one and wounding ten people. Osbourne was not a devout ideologue. He had become radicalized in less than a month through the rapid consumption of far-right online material. He devoured social media posts from former English Defence League (EDL) leader Tommy Robinson, members of Britain First, and other right-wing extremists.
The fascist propaganda left him a ""ticking time bomb,"" as he began developing a warped belief system and viewing himself as an extremist right-wing soldier.
None of the material Osborne viewed from the extreme right crossed the line into being either criminal or breaking current terrorism laws. As such, despite his Internet history, his acrimonious rants outlining his desire to kill Muslims and the suicide note he left filled with racist vitriol, Osbourne was charged with murder and attempted murder--not with terror offenses.
David Ibsen, executive director of the Counter Extremism Project (CEP), released the following statement today:
""CEP extends its sympathies to the victims of the Finsbury Park attack.
""Extremists from each end of the spectrum are continuing to exploit the loopholes in British laws. Many of these actors, be they far-right extremists or radical Islamists, are operating with impunity, particularly online, as they continue to skirt some aspects of the law while intentionally inciting violence. Darren Osbourne was undoubtedly inspired by the extremist, hate-filled language of the far-right that proliferates online. The impact of radical or extremist language needs to be recognized and reprimanded by law.
""Recently, the British Commission for Countering Extremism revealed that it has gathered widespread evidence that many hate crimes are not reaching the threshold of the law, leaving the authorities powerless to stop many attacks that are not recognized as crimes under terrorism legislation or hate laws.
""CEP welcomes the Commission for Countering Extremism's decision to launch a legal review into the issue and echoes their call for an overhaul of the U.K. government's strategy to combat hate crimes and hate speech.""

Gun arrests continue to rise in the face of increased shooting violence
The year so far has presented significant public safety challenges with gun violence continuing to afflict New Yorkers across the city. As shootings continued their upward trajectory in November, citywide shooting incidents through the first eleven months of 2020 surged to levels unseen in years.
That spike in street violence contrasts with the levels of overall crime remaining flat through the first 11 months of the year, or up a combined +0.6% (8,170 v. 8,120) in the seven major felony categories amid an ongoing COVID-19 outbreak that continues to strain the city and its police. And hate crimes, in particular, are dramatically down. Even as the pandemic prompted a spike in coronavirus-related hate crimes against those of Asian descent, it was swiftly addressed by the formation of an Asian Hate Crime Task Force that has so far helped to close 16 of 24 of those reported crimes with an arrest.
On gun violence, the NYPD's unrelenting work to suppress it goes on. The data to date shows that our officers' continued focus on making strong gun cases is increasingly taking hold.
Gun arrests for the month of November are up +112.3% (484 v. 228), driving a +22.2% increase in citywide gun arrests (3,793 v. 3,104) compared with the same period a year ago. Going forward, the NYPD will continue to cultivate information to arrest anyone willing to purchase, carry or sell an illegal firearm in New York City.
Still, shootings have victimized far too many. For November, there was a +112.5% (115 v. 51) increase in shootings citywide. And shootings have risen +95.8% (1,412 v. 721) through the first 11 months of 2020, compared with the same period last year. Notable in the gun violence is an emerging trend the NYPD is weaving into its precision-driven enforcement approach: 40% of those accused of a shooting have had a past gun possession arrest, while 21% of shooting victims have had one.
To serve those harmed on both sides of the gun our officers and citizens continue to build the kind of bonds that are essential to our shared sense of well-being. Our investigators, Neighborhood Coordination and Youth officers, as well as every uniformed officer on patrol, remain steadfast in achieving the kind of common good all New Yorkers demand.
On violent crime, homicides have also risen both for the month and the year. November saw 28 people murdered in the five boroughs, five more than were killed last November. So far in 2020, there has been a +38.4% increase (422 v. 305) in the number of victims murdered in New York City compared to last year.
""Whatever the challenge, our NYPD officers have shown innovation and determination to get the job done this year,"" said Police Commissioner Dermot Shea .

Cuomo Announces $17 Million in Federal Funding to Strengthen Security for Nonprofits Facing High Risks of Terrorism",FALSE,"Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D-New York, issued the following news release on Aug. 25:
Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced more than $17 million in federal funding has been awarded to 178 nonprofit organizations facing an increased risk of terrorism to strengthen the security of their facilities as well as enhance their overall preparedness. This funding, provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency through its Nonprofit Security Grant Program, is being allocated to New York through two separate awards -- $12.7 million for organizations within the New York City Metro Area and $4.3 million for organizations throughout the rest of the state. The New York State Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services manages these programs in close coordination with local stakeholders.
""The cancer of hate and division spreading across this country is repugnant to the values of diversity and inclusion we hold dear in New York State,"" Governor Cuomo said. ""This funding builds on the efforts already started by New York to help secure communities against hate and will enable organizations throughout the state to ensure they are protected against those seeking to do harm.""
Nationwide, a total of $90 million is being provided through the Nonprofit Security Grant Program in FY 2020. Of this amount, $50 million in funding was made available to nonprofit organizations located within one of the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) designated high-risk urban areas. The remaining $40 million was reserved for jurisdictions outside of the UASI-designated areas.
In New York, the state's UASI-designated high-risk urban area is the New York City Metro Area. Specifically, this consists of New York City, as well as Westchester, Nassau and Suffolk Counties. In 2020, New York leads the nation in both total funding and number of awardees in a UASI-designated area, with $12.7 million being awarded to 130 nonprofit organizations. The remaining $4.3 million in federal funding will be awarded to 48 nonprofit organizations throughout the rest of the state.
New York State Homeland Security and Emergency Services Commissioner Patrick A. Murphy said, ""As part of New York's long history of embracing and promoting diversity, we continue to combat threats aimed at individuals and organizations simply because of their culture and beliefs. Thanks to this funding however, those at risk will be able to access critical security resources to ensure they are protected as they continue their good work helping to improve their communities.""
Allowable costs include:
Planning:
* Security Risk Management Plans
* Continuity of Operations Plans
* Response Plans
Equipment/Staffing:
* Physical security enhancement equipment
* Inspection and screening systems
* Contracted Security Personnel
Training:
* Active Shooter Training
* Security Training for employees, or members/congregation
Exercises:
* Response exercises
This federal funding will bolster ongoing efforts led by Governor Cuomo to ensure non-public schools and cultural centers, including religious-based institutions, have the resources they need to protect against the threat of hate crimes. Already, a total of $25 million in state funding has been awarded to more than 500 organizations through the Governor's Securing Communities Against Hate Crimes Grant Program https://www.governor.ny.gov/apply-securing-communities-against-hate-crimes-grant-program.

TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT, right now.
TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Usually by this point in a presidential cycle, we've got a pretty good idea what the candidates believe and you think that would be especially true this year.
Joe Biden has been in politics for more than half a century. This is his third run for President.
Since 1969, the year of the moon landing, Joe Biden has been yammering in public virtually without stopping until this year.
This year, the famously chatty Joe Biden has said almost nothing. His advisers claim that's because of COVID-19, but nobody believes that. Everybody knows why Biden won't appear in public. When he does emerge, things tend to get strange. Biden's words take on a kind of psychedelic quality.
The sentences seem to be connected, yet at the same time, they are strangely disjointed. Newspaper taxis appear on the shore. Rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies. It's mesmerizing to watch, you can almost make out the tangerine trees in the marmalade skies.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOE BIDEN (D), PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: We thought in our administration, we should lower the tax in the high 30s to 28 percent, then lower it to 21. I'm going to raise it back up to 28.
It is just not sufficient to build back, we have to build back better. That's what my plan is, to build back better. It is bold.
These aren't somebody else's children. They're all our children. They're the children -- those children are the kite strings that hold our national ambitions aloft.
The only entity, the only thing that can tear America apart is America itself. Period.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: What does any of that mean? Honestly, we don't know, but Joe Biden doesn't either. It's all good, man.
This is the candidate who could soon be President of the United States. Don't tell him that, it'll only make him anxious. The people around Biden, by contrast, are not anxious. They are completely in control. They know exactly what they want.
And yesterday, they gave the rest of us a glimpse of what that is. The Biden campaign released a long document outlining its goals. It was written by Eric Holder, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Symone Sanders, among others. These are the people who will run the country if Joe Biden is elected in November.
So what's their plan? Well, in a sentence, they'd like to make the rest of America very much like our biggest cities have become -- squalid, dangerous, chaotic and unhappy. They'd like to do to your neighborhood what they have done to New York City.
The main thing they've done to New York is make it scary. Violent crime is surging dramatically there as we have told you night after night, and one of the main reasons for that is the elimination of cash bail. The city no longer holds the people it arrests. Criminals are in and out of custody immediately. And many of course go on to commit more crimes. It's nuts.
The Biden campaign plans to abolish cash bail everywhere. No bail for any crime nationwide. Think about what that would mean. Americans are fleeing urban areas in huge numbers. Big cities are just too mismanaged. They're too dangerous.
Unless you are very rich or very poor, you're getting out. New York City lost 53,000 people in 2019. They will lose far more than that this year.
Most of these refugees have relocated to the suburbs where they imagine they are safe from the effects of disastrous urban policy. But they're not. Democrats want to abolish the suburbs. They are too clean and nice and therefore by definition, they are racist.
The Biden campaign has highly specific plans on how to do this. It's called Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing. It's a HUD regulation. It was written during the Obama administration. Biden's advisers plan to enforce it.
They will cut off critical Federal funds for municipalities unless those municipalities submit to federal control of urban planning. Towns will be ordered to abolish zoning for single family housing because single family homes needless to say, are racist.
Low income federally subsidized apartments will go up in the suburbs. It's a good bet you won't see any of this. You won't see projects being built in Aspen or Martha's Vineyard or anywhere else that Eric Holder vacations, but in your neighborhood, oh yes.
Your kids' schools will change, too. The Biden campaign has vowed to bring back Obama's lunatic Title 9 rules. Colleges have once again ignored due process and the presumption of innocence and instead use kangaroo courts to assess sexual assault allegations on campus. Good luck to your sons.
The country's K through 12 schools meanwhile, effectively will abandon classroom discipline. Schools that suspend students based on their behavior, rather than according to a strict racial quota system will be punished for that. But you will have no choice but to keep your kids enrolled anyway because Biden's campaign pledges to abolish all programs that provide parents vouchers or tax breaks to send their kids somewhere else.
And then the Biden plan gets really ambitious. It would use the Federal Reserve to fix the quote, ""racial wage gap."" Central bankers will be encouraged to decide if you're being paid too much based on your skin color. It sounds like a great way to unite the country.
One thing the Biden administration won't enforce is immigration law. The plan promises to end workplace immigration raids. That would mean corporations could bring in effectively unlimited amounts of low wage illegal foreign labor. Good luck finding your son a job once he is bounced out of college by those kangaroo courts.
You might think this all sounds too crazy to be real. Politicians, of course make a lot of promises right before elections and Biden would never actually do any of this because Democrats should be worried about losing the next election if they did. These are not popular programs.
But the Biden people have thought this through and their plan answers that question. It solves the problem. It includes citizenship and voting rights for all illegal immigrants currently living in this country. That's at least 22 million people.
That means 22 million brand new voters spread out across 50 states, the vast majority of them will faithfully vote for the Democratic Party. And by the way, that's not even including all the new illegal immigration we will doubtless get with reduced border controls. The Biden campaign also promises a moratorium on deportations.
So there it is, that's the Biden plan. It is not really a blueprint to govern the country. It is a promise to utterly remake the country. And more to the point, never surrender control of it again.
Britt Hume is our senior political analyst here at Fox. He joins us tonight. Brit, thanks so much for coming on. So, if you added 22 million new voters, the overwhelming majority of whom, there's research on this, faithfully vote Democrat. Is it fair to say no Republican could ever win a national election at least for the foreseeable future?
BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: I think that's a reasonable assumption in the foreseeable future and it wouldn't take -- you know, it wouldn't take 22 million. So I'd say the number were half that, 11 million new voters, the overwhelming majority of whom would vote for a Democrat would keep the Democrats in power in the White House for sure for several election cycles, at least.
And it would also mean that around the country that many races that might be closer toss ups or even go Republican would not. So, I think that's a fair assumption of what the consequences of that would be.
I might say, Tucker, that while Biden in his remarks today on the economy, through a few things in the direction of Trump voters he talked about, you know, how much money the government was going to spend to revive and direct the economy.
This agenda that you've laid out here is not the agenda of a man who is trying to reach out beyond his own party for support. This is a man who is simply trying to solidify support within his own party, believing that that's all he needs, and he might be right about that.
But this has taken the Democratic Party farther to the left than it's ever been, as even Bernie Sanders was saying today about this compromise agenda that's been reached with him and AOC, and Rashida Tlaib and others.
So, that is where we are. This is a man who simply thinks that the nomination is all he needs. That he is basically guaranteed the election. He might be right.
CARLSON: If Democrats retake the White House and the Senate and that could absolutely happen and if they abolish the filibuster, and that could happen, too, would there be any way to stop giving citizenship to 22 million or whatever the actual number is of foreign nationals living here illegally?
HUME: Not that I can see -- I mean, there are many other things that would be hard to stop. If they wanted to give statehood to the District of Columbia. There are arguments made by some scholars who say no, no, you need a constitutional amendment to do that.
But Congress does have the power to add states. And now whether that runs into constitutional prohibitions as a matter for judges to decide. But it's something that I think would be attempted, and that, of course, would add two more seats in the Senate which would be guaranteed to be Democratic in perpetuity.
So that would be one more restraint on their agenda that would break down if they got control of both Houses of Congress. It would be quite -- this would be the liberals' wish list put into action. You can guarantee it.
CARLSON: I wonder why -- I wonder if your average Republican voter -- I mean, there's so many things going on right now -- understands that we're headed and who knows where we'll wind up, but at this point, we're headed at very high speed toward effectively a one party state at least again for the foreseeable future. Do people understand that?
HUME: Well, they might. For example, let's think about what happened over the holiday weekend. The President came out and made a speech which as you pointed out, was basically a full throated defense of American history and its heroes. It was in no sense a bigoted speech. It certainly wasn't to honor and glorify Confederates, none of whom was mentioned. It was quite a strong speech and a lot of people thought it was the best speech he'd ever given.
Well, it was grossly mischaracterized in the press. But that's shouldn't be a barrier to do a campaign with as much money as a Trump campaign has to get the word out.
And then then two days later, the President picks a fight with that NASCAR driver instead of pounding home the message that had been handed him basically on a platter by the Democrats' attacks on his speech.
So he has opportunities here. He has chances. The sheer leftward drift of this party and the outright leftism of this agenda would continue to present opportunities if the Trump campaign and Trump himself can capitalize on them. It remains to be seen if he can or will, and he can stop talking about himself long enough to talk about something else and talk about their agenda and his message.
CARLSON: Yes, I mean, there is an awful lot at stake -- an awful lot. And I know people always say that before elections, particularly partisans. People get all inflamed. This is the most important election ever. You've seen a lot of elections, does this seem a significant one to you?
HUME: Tucker, I've been in the habit for many election cycles. I am telling people who ask me how important the election was, I would always say it's the most important election since the last one, and will be the most important one until the next one.
I think this may be a little different here because Trump was elected in an overwhelming response from people who said, I've had enough. I don't want any more of this.
CARLSON: Yes.
HUME: And he's governed as a disrupter, and if this swings back this quickly, it is a little hard for me to see it swing back in the other direction for quite some time. So, I think this is -- this election is different. This is big. No doubt.
CARLSON: I think that's a wise assessment. Brit Hume, thank you so much.
HUME: You bet.
CARLSON: Well, authorities in New York are taking drastic steps to make sure Ghislaine Maxwell's stint in jail ends differently from Jeffrey Epstein's. We will tell you what they're doing. That's a very strange story by the way. I just want to pause a note. There's more going on with the Maxwell arrest than I think we understand at this point. Just want to get that on the record.
Well, Seattle is pushing anti-racism training on city employees that consists of screaming at them for how they were born. Sound anti-racist to you? We will explain just ahead.
CARLSON: Jeffrey Epstein's death -- his convenient death last year kept the rest of us from knowing anything at all really about what he did, who helped him do it and where all the money came from.
Authorities tonight are taking radical steps to make certain that nothing like that happens to his former fixer, Ghislaine Maxwell.
Emily Compagno is a former Federal attorney and host of ""Crimes That Changed America"" on Fox Nation. We're happy to have her on tonight -- Emily.
EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Hi, Tucker. As you know, Ghislaine Maxwell has been charged with six Federal crimes, four of which involve transporting minors for illegal sexual activity.
After being booked into Brooklyn's Federal and Metropolitan Detention Center awaiting her bail hearing tomorrow, the Bureau of Prisons has now taken away her bedsheets and given her paper clothes out of fear she may die by suicide.
The Justice Department has implemented additional safety precautions and tasked the BOP with ensuring her safety both from herself and others, including other protocols like assigning her a roommate, consistently monitoring her and making sure she is accompanied behind bars at all times.
A storm of controversy followed Jeffrey Epstein's ruled death by suicide on August 10th of last year while in a different New York City Federal Detention Center and the events leading up to his suspicious death were a quote, ""perfect storm of screw ups"" according to U.S. Attorney General William Barr, and began weeks before his actual death, involving what authorities called then a failed suicide attempt, failure of suicide watch protocols, failure of inmate count protocols, jail cameras that failed to record, guards that fell asleep on the job.
This admission to the court of the wrong video footage and ultimately, a second autopsy report that contradicted the official declaration of suicide death by hanging.
Recall Epstein's death, too, came less than one day after part of the 2,000 documents containing lurid and shocking testimony from his sex abuse victims was unsealed in a case also against Ghislaine Maxwell.
During Epstein's Federal prosecution, law enforcement discovered a safe at his $77 million mansion that contained thousands of nude photographs and videos of young girls, including minors, all meticulously labeled, which prosecutors at the time described as a lewd trove of devastating evidence against him.
Ghislaine is reportedly also sitting on a secret stash of photographs and videos of illicit sexual activity with minors, and reports are, she has quote, ""copies of everything Epstein had.""
She has hired the former Federal prosecutor who helped to bring down Sinaloa cartel drug kingpin, Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman as her attorney who after that successful prosecution was awarded the true American Hero Award by the Federal Drug Agent Foundation.
Ghislaine faces up to 35 years in Federal prison if convicted.
CARLSON: Interesting. Emily, thanks so much for that report. Appreciate it.
It's a weird story. Why did she come back to this country? She had to have known she'd be arrested. She was living abroad. She's got foreign passports, at least one. Probably more going on here than we know.
So here's a thought experiment for you. Oklahoma City is one of the most conservative metro areas in the United States, Donald Trump won almost 60 percent of the vote there four years ago.
Imagine if the conservatives who presumably run local government in Oklahoma City sent an e-mail to every African-American municipal employee, telling them to report to a special meeting.
Imagine that when those employees arrived again, again, black employees only -- nobody else allowed -- they were informed that the fact they were black was deeply offensive. In fact, it was a kind of crime. And the only way to atone for the sin of their blackness was to apologize for it. Apologize for being born black, and then work to shed all traces of your black identity.
Stop spending so much time around your black friends. Stop repeating things your black parents told you growing up. Start admitting out loud that you hate yourself for having black skin.
Imagine if that actually happened in this country? What would you think of it? We'd be horrified. Obviously. It's completely disgusting.
It is immoral to attack people for how they were born. It's always immoral. And by the way, it's also illegal. The Justice Department would never tolerate something like that. The Civil Rights Division would shut down the program tonight and would bring criminal charges against the people who ran it and you would applaud them as they did that and we would, too.
So with that in mind, consider what is happening right now in one of America's most liberal cities -- Seattle.
Four years ago, Hillary Clinton got 87 percent of the vote in Seattle. There aren't many places more loyal to the Democratic Party. Recently, the City of Seattle summoned its white employees and only its white employees to a meeting and then informed them their skin color is a crime.
The city called this Anti-Racism Training. Events like it are taking place all over the country right now in schools, local governments, corporations, and the military. The City of Seattle named its training session, ""Interrupting Internalized Racial Superiority and Whiteness.""
Chris Rufo of ""City Journal"" wanted to know exactly what went on in a meeting like that, so he filed a public records request. Here's what he found.
White employees in Seattle were informed that their so-called white qualities were offensive and unacceptable. Those qualities included perfectionism, objectivity, and individualism. The employees were told to stop exhibiting these characteristics, and instead they were ordered to undertake quote, ""the work of undoing your own whiteness.""
In order to achieve that, in order to erase the traits they were born with, white employees in Seattle were ordered to give up the following. They were ordered to give up comfort. They were ordered to give up spending time with their family. They were ordered to give up guaranteed physical safety, control over other people and the land, relationships with some other white people, niceties from neighbors and colleagues, and quote, ""The certainty of your jobs."" Prepare to be unemployed pale employees of Seattle. Your skin color disgusts us.
All of that actually happened in Seattle. Check out Chris Rufo's new piece in ""City Journal"" if you want more details on it, but again, atrocities like this aren't just happening in Seattle. They're happening everywhere.
Some will almost certainly happen in your kid's school this fall. No one will ask your permission before they do it. They'll just attack your children for how they were born. The people doing the attacking by the way would tell you with a straight face how opposed they are to gay conversion therapy because of course it's immoral to try to change people's intrinsic qualities.
They wouldn't see the irony in that. More likely, they don't care about irony. This isn't about principles. It's about hate, humiliation and power. It is about hurting people. It always is.
Telling people they're inferior because of their skin color was wrong when it happened 60 years ago in Alabama. It was every bit as wrong when it happens today in Seattle or at Yale or Google headquarters or at your kids' elementary school.
Attacking people on the basis of their race is a sin. There is nothing worse for a country. They can try to disguise it with Orwellian terms like anti-racism, but this is the purest kind of race hate. It will destroy America faster than anything else. Don't put up with it. Resist. Speak out. Fight back.
This is totally wrong. Until you stand up, it will continue.
Well, at some point, this country will move past coronavirus. If Joe Biden is elected, it'll be declared cured in one day. Many jobs though have disappeared in the meantime. Could there be opportunities in blue collar work? Mike Rowe has thought more about this than maybe any person in America. He joins us next.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MIKE ROWE, AMERICAN TELEVISION HOST: Hey world. How's it going? Me? Pretty good. All things considered, I guess. A little cooped up if I'm being honest. In fact, I've been dreaming here of late of a road trip.
So, guess what's happening? See what I did there? It is a road trip.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: That's a clip from Mike Rowe's brand new show, ""Dirty Jobs: Rowe'D Trip."" He's a man we've been thinking a lot about recently, as millions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been furloughed or laid off entirely thanks to the lockdowns.
A child just leaving high school or college right now is entering one of the toughest labor markets in the history of this country. But there is still opportunity out there and if anyone knows about it, it's Mike Rowe and we're happy to have him on right now.
Mike, thanks so much for coming on. So, you are a master of the good news. Tell us the good news.
ROWE: Oh, I'm a glass half full kind of guy for sure. It's a great time to be alive. A little weird, for sure. And we've got some challenges, for sure.
But if you have a skill that's in demand, you are going to be in demand like never before. And I've never been more certain of that than I am right now. My foundation is entering its 13th year. We're giving away a million dollars this month to men and women who want to learn a skill or master a trade.
You know it. I've been pushing this boulder up the hill for a long time. And I'm seeing some things I haven't seen before. A reinvigoration and enthusiasm around the basics of simply learning a skill that's absolutely in demand -- of being essential, in other words.
CARLSON: So, when we've spoken about this before over the years, you have said you've had trouble giving away the money because everyone wanted to work in private equity.
I wonder if the perspective of people is going to change because of what we're going through now?
ROWE: Well, I think it is. You know, I've been talking a lot about $1.5 trillion in student loans on the books and the very real fact that that's a millstone around the necks of hundreds of thousands of kids. People are getting that message, but they're also now seeing -- they're seeing that there is a difference between skills that are in demand and education that is not.
And it's not to say, one is bad and one is good. These are two sides of the same coin. But historically, we've tried to separate those two things. ""Dirty Jobs"" just got rebooted, because the headlines once again caught up to the underlying themes of that show, and the country is now having a grown up conversation about the definition of a good job.
And so, if I seem prescient, it's only because I've been sitting here in the same place for the last 12 years, and eventually, headlines will catch up with you.
And I'm telling you, right now, like never before, if you're a welder with a work ethic, you'll be among the dozens of people making six figures that my foundation has helped hundreds, in fact. The stories are everywhere.
CARLSON: You're turning out to be vindicated, because you've never taken your eyes off the fundamental question, which is who really is essential? You know, what, what's an ephemeral job? What's an essential job? Someone has to keep the power grid going, for example.
Do you think -- I mean, is there evidence? Are you seeing actual numbers to suggest that people really are reorienting their view of these questions?
ROWE: Well, it's all things are micro/macro. I'm Mike Rowe and the Mike Rowe Foundation. I can tell you that the changes have been demonstrable over the last decade.
I have a sense that that's being echoed in the macroeconomic numbers, but I can't prove it. Most of my evidence is apocryphal. It always has been. But the enthusiasm for the idea of learning a skill that's in demand is real. And I will say, too, with regard to essential, it's been kind of humbling for me because I've always defaulted to people who labor out of sight and out of mind doing things that keep civilized life possible for the rest of us. That's the definition of essential.
We've got 40 million people out of work. We've just deemed them de facto, nonessential. Now that's crazy. Because if you think those people are not essential, well, look at the economy. Look at the trillions of dollars of bailouts.
It's like tugging on a on a string or a piece of yarn on a sweater, right? It bunches up on the other side. Essential and nonessential aren't opposites. They are two sides of the same coin, but I believe we're entering a phase right now where the undeniable truth is going to land squarely on the side of opportunity, as defined by the willingness to learn a skill.
CARLSON: Yes. I think that's exactly right. Let me ask you one last quick question. You've interviewed a countless number of people with essential but low prestige jobs. Are they happy, by and large doing those jobs?
ROWE: Again, cookie cutter advice is tricky, and I hate generalizations. But, yes, there exists in the wide world of work, a band of brothers mentality. And if I could tell you anything that was generally true about my experience on ""Dirty Jobs,"" and I've just seen it again, I'll be seeing it every Tuesday this month. It's that they're having a better time than people think.
This group of people who understand that they are essential, who understand risk in a way that most of us don't, who understand the benefits of showing up early and staying late, and this is going to sound very Horatio Alger, but I'm telling you, Tucker, it's going to come back -- attitude, personal responsibility, delayed gratification, work ethic.
It's not what anybody wants to hear, but it's for sale. And the examples that we've been able to find in my own little foundation that prove those things lead to something that looks a lot like prosperity. They are undeniable. They're everywhere.
CARLSON: You've been right about everything else. I knew you'd make me feel better. Mike Rowe, thank you for that.
ROWE: Standing by to fill the glass up whenever you need it, Tucker.
CARLSON: Amen. We often do. Good to see you.
ROWE: Be well.
CARLSON: Well, Black Lives Matter is effectively a political party and you thought in this country you were allowed to express your opinions about political parties, but in this case, no. If you oppose Black Lives Matter, you could be charged with a hate crime.
After the break, we'll talk to a couple in California who were charged with a hate crime for that. We'll be right back.
CARLSON: Harvard University, where you did not go, but many highly impressive people at McKinsey & Company did go, announced this week that classes for its 7,000 undergraduates will be held only online coming this fall.
Of course, that means those classes will be a joke. People don't learn very well online. If you've got kids at home right now trying it, you know that for a fact.
But here's the rub. Harvard also announced it will not be cutting any of its $50,000.00 a year tuition, not by a penny. And according to a writer at slate.com called Jordan Weissmann, that's fine. Because actually education is not the point of Harvard or any school like Harvard.
Earlier this week, Weissmann wrote this, quote, ""The main benefit of an Ivy League education isn't really classes. Schools like Harvard, Stanford, Yale and Princeton serve as four-year networking events and outsourced HR departments for companies in finance, tech and media,"" end quote.
And actually, that's true. But because it is true, it does raise a couple of other questions. If attending Harvard or Stanford or Yale, whatever Yale gets renamed next year, isn't really about education, then why do these schools get tax free endowments that are larger than the GDP of some African countries?
Why are the loans that people take out to go to these schools guaranteed by taxpayers and non-dischargeable in Bankruptcy Court? Why do these schools get billions of dollars in other benefits from you, if they're just networking and HR opportunities from kids from families that are already rich and well connected?
Those are questions worth considering.
Well, it took months but people who run the country eventually got bored with shaming the rest of us for trying to go outside or earn a living during COVID-19. So now they have a new hobby, praising the mostly peaceful protesters who are destroying our cities, spray painting graffiti everywhere, assaulting their opponents, ripping down statues of George Washington.
Just today Nancy Pelosi explained that statues don't matter.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): I don't care much about statues.
QUESTION: But shouldn't that be done by a -- respectfully, should that not be done by a commission or the city council, not a mob in the middle of the night throwing it into the harbor?
PELOSI: People will do what they do.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: People do what they do. Try to take down a statue of somebody Nancy Pelosi admires and find out what happens. But these statues, who cares? They're just dead traitors, says one of the dumbest members of the US Senate recently called them.
But there's one kind of expression that people like Nancy Pelosi can't stand and won't stand for. People who say the United States isn't racist, and don't want public spaces filled with leftwing graffiti.
In the town of Martinez, California, activists spray painted Black Lives Matter in the middle of a public street, which they do not own, but they did it anyway.
In response to this, two taxpayers, residents of the town called Nicole Anderson and David Nelson decided to return their streets to normal
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
NICOLE ANDERSON, RESIDENT CHARGED WITH HATE CRIME: Keep this [bleep] in [bleep] New York. This is not happening in my town.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Your ancestors are [bleep] colonizers. You're not from [bleep] America. You're a [bleep] colonizer. Your ancestors aren't from here.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: [Bleep] your bucket. [Bleep] that [bleep]. You want something, come and get it. Cause you're not [bleep] getting this bucket anymore, dumb [bleep].
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: It's not happening in my town, she said to which a lunatic said, it's not your country. It's not your country.
Now to be clear, the people you just saw on tape hurt nobody. They destroyed nothing, and yet they have been charged with a hate crime by the State of California.
Nicole Anderson and David Nelson, join us tonight. We're happy to have them. Thanks so much for coming on.
ANDERSON: Hello. Thank you.
DAVID NELSON, RESIDENT CHARGED WITH HATE CRIME: Thank you.
CARLSON: So tell us if you would -- I think we already know this, but just summarize for us quickly why you did this.
NELSON: Yes, so Tucker, I was on my way home on a bike ride, and I saw what they were going downtown there with the graffiti and I grew up in Martinez. So, it struck a chord with me.
I don't agree with BLM. Don't get me wrong. I have no problem with black people. That's not what this is about. They have a hidden agenda.
So when I saw that, I went home and let Nicole know. And she said, I'm going to go down there and paint over it. And I said, no. She goes, yes, I am. When she has her mind made up, that's what she's going to do. She's going to do so.
We went down there and I went down there just to have her back. And, and then somebody got in my face and just kind of set me off. And I want to be clear that I wish I would have handled it more diplomatically.
But I was angry, and we're sick of this. We're sick of the narrative.
ANDERSON: Yes. I just didn't want them to defund our police. Luckily, we have them. Thank God we have them in these last couple of days.
CARLSON: Yes.
ANDERSON: Yes.
CARLSON: So you're aware and it's your town. I mean, you just said that you're from there. And yes, the people who painted this don't own the street. I presume you pay taxes.
NELSON: Yes.
ANDERSON: Oh, yes.
CARLSON: You're aware that in California, rather in San Francisco, not that far from you, BLM activists ripped down a statue and spray painted ""kill whitey"" on it, which is obviously a racial attack, an incitement to violence. I don't think anyone was charged with a hate crime. In fact, nobody was. Why do you think you were charged with a quote ""hate crime""?
NELSON: Well, it's because we decided to stand against an organization that we don't agree with, and that's the issue that we're facing. If an American can't stand up and voice their opinion, and these were being silenced, it's a cancel culture that we're living in.
And if we don't do something, we need to stand up. Everybody needs to get together and band together and actually take to the streets. I hear a lot of talk. But I don't actually see Americans standing up and doing something about it.
And the reason being is because we're losing jobs when we stand up. You see what happened to Kelly Loeffler. They want her to step down.
So I mean, this is what we're facing here in America. And it's imperative that we do something and do it quick because we're starting to lose ground here.
CARLSON: Yes, well they're trying to make an example out of you. The people who did this, who charged with a hate crime should be impeached because it's completely outrageous.
NELSON: Yes.
CARLSON: But I've wonder about the consequences to you. I mean, there's nothing more shameful than being charged with a hate crime, which is of course why they did it. Are you worried about losing your job?
NELSON: It's up in the air right now as we speak.
ANDERSON: I work for myself.
NELSON: Yes, she works for herself, so she doesn't have to worry about it, but, I guess it's a very --
CARLSON: But you think you could be fired, David, because of this?
NELSON: Yes, I'm actually -- I'm actually on a leave type of thing right now to wait and see what happens.
CARLSON: Man, you've got a lot of brass. This was a brave thing -- this was a brave thing to do. I mean, do you -- are you paying a lawyer to defend you again? I just want to say again, you've been charged with a hate crime for painting over graffiti that wasn't supposed to be there.
NELSON: That's right.
ANDERSON: Yes.
NELSON: This is the double standard and the hypocrisy of the whole thing. It's okay for BLM to go around and burn down the country, terrorize America, actually kill people. They've done more harm than the good here, Tucker. When we stand up and give them a little iota, a taste of their own medicine, this is the extreme measures that are being taken and we can't let it happen.
We need to stand up. We need to get together. All Americans in every city and take to the streets. It's --
ANDERSON: Yes.
CARLSON: Man, I hope someone defends you. Conservatives have spent billions of dollars on these nonprofits in D.C. They vote for the Republican politicians. I hope one of those people, many of them spring to your aid because this is an outrage. So you're very brave. Thank you for coming on tonight.
ANDERSON: Yes.
NELSON: Thank you very much, Tucker. My pleasure.
CARLSON: David and Nicole, thanks.
Well, Kanye West is running for President. You think it may be a joke, but it's not a joke. And by the way, in 2020, anything is possible. So if West is on the ballot this fall, how many votes could he get and what effect would it have on the race? We're thinking about it and we will after the break.
CARLSON: Kanye West says he is running for President, and of course if he wants to win, he will need votes. He's already taking the first step by registering himself to vote.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KANYE WEST, ARTIST: Hey, what's up, everybody. As you see, I'm here at the County Clerk's Office and I wanted to show you how I just registered to vote.
I just want to show everybody how easy it is to vote here. New voter application. My name, my date of birth. Last issue Wyoming driver's license.
There's a lot of people who think they can't vote because they're a convicted felon, but they actually can ask for their rights back.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
WEST: Why do some other states make it so complicated to vote?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, the statutes are set up by legislature.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: So that's the start. What happens next? If Kanye West gets in the race in a meaningful way, what effect will that have? Will he take more votes from Biden or from Trump? Could be a relevant question.
Jason Nichols is Professor of African American Studies at the University of Maryland. We're happy to have him on tonight. Professor, thanks for coming on. So, what do you imagine the effect of Kanye West getting in the race will be?
JASON NICHOLS, PROFESSOR OF AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDIES, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND: Well, first of all, let's make it clear that there's pretty much -- it's pretty much mathematically impossible that he would win. He is already ineligible in about four states, one of them being Texas. So that's impossible.
But I think that he could play spoiler. Now, the question is, to whom? He right could take youth votes away from Biden and he could take some votes away from Trump, based on the fact that he claims that he had COVID-19, and he will highlight the fact that Trump has failed, in many cases or in many ways on the COVID-19 crisis.
So I think he has -- it is a chance that he could take from either pool of voters. I think that one of the things that I think really hurts Trump also is that of course, he is married to Kim Kardashian-West, and the whole Alice Johnson talking point was a big thing for the Trump campaign.
And she kind of steals that away and says no, that was me. That was me that advocated for Alice Johnson. It was me that had to come to your office and talk about Criminal Justice Reform, and then he starts to lose perhaps some of the few black votes that he has, and this is going to be razor -- this is going to be a razor thin election, when we're talking about, you know, last time it was 77,000 votes in Wisconsin. It could be even thinner.
And Kanye West, if he's able to garner that kind of support somewhere, he could spoil it for either one of these. I'm thinking more that he will spoil it for Trump, but it's possible that he could spoil it for Biden as well.
CARLSON: My view is anything that disassociates Trump from so-called Criminal Justice Reform probably help him, at least with me. But Kanye West is also --
NICHOLS: I think there's a minority there.
CARLSON: I don't know that I am, just considering everything that's happening, but we'll see.
But Kanye West is also a self-described Christian. He's been pretty assertive in bringing the Christian message. And I wonder if you could see Christians vote for Kanye West?
NICHOLS: Well, I mean, I think that that's possible. He certainly, you know -- of course, there are lots of Christians who have issues with Joe Biden, based on, you know, perhaps the fact that he is pro-choice.
There are lots of Christians who have issues particularly in the evangelical community that have issues with Trump in the way he behaves and comports himself.
CARLSON: Right.
NICHOLS: So I think that there is a lane for someone like Kanye West to actually slide in and get some Christian votes with his, you know, his gospel albums and some of the messages that he's going to bring forth.
CARLSON: Why is he doing this? Do you know?
NICHOLS: Well, some people say it's to promote his records, to promote himself. I think he's just somebody who thinks big and looks for big challenges.
So I think that that's one of the reasons you know, that Kanye West is going after the presidency. There's nothing bigger.
I think that was the same thing with Donald Trump. Also, people said he couldn't do it. And I think ambitious people when you tell them that they can't do something, that's when they get motivated and they take action. And I think that's what Kanye West is doing.
He's somebody who actually is self-made. He didn't get a $400 million start the way Donald Trump did. He's actually a self-made billionaire. And I think that he thinks he can conquer anything. So he's going to give it a shot.
CARLSON: I would say announcing for President in July of a presidential year is dead. That's it. That's an ambitious program. I mean, you know, I stand unconvinced either way. But we'll see.
Jason Nichols, one of our favorites. Thank you so much.
NICHOLS: Thanks so much.
CARLSON: Great to see you.
We're out of time, amazingly. Remarkable how fast an hour goes. We hope you have a great night, hopefully with the ones you love. We will be back tomorrow, which is Friday.
But in the meantime, we have good news for you. We're going to play a quick quiz game in our remaining 10 seconds. Who do you think is taking over? Who's grabbing the baton? The Great Sean Hannity from New York."

KIM BRUNHUBER, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Also ahead, the European Union debates blocking visitors from the U.S. or any country which is yet to bring the pandemic under control. And the FBI says the noose found in the garage of black NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace isn't linked to a criminal act.
COVID-19 isn't done making people sick in many parts of the world, and it's brought the U.S. economy ""To Its knees"" those words from the Director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. He was one of several public health leaders who testified Tuesday at a hearing on Capitol Hill.
Over half of all states are seeing a rise in new cases. Just look at this 7-day moving average. New confirmed cases are almost back to where they were in March and April. Meanwhile, deaths in Latin America and the Caribbean have surpassed 100,000 according to a Johns Hopkins tally and government figures.
Brazil accounts for more than half of that total. And European Union member states are talking about banning travelers from several countries, including the U.S. Lucy Kafanov reports from Texas, a state that's considering putting restrictions back in place.
LUCY KAFANOV, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Kim. Coronavirus cases spiking here in Texas and this is just one of 26 states across America that's seeing an increase in the number of cases from this illness the nation's top health officials ringing the alarm but the U.S. President ignoring those warnings.
On Capitol Hill, an urgent warning from the nation's top infectious disease doctor as President Trump campaign on the other side of the country in Arizona, one of the states experiencing a rapid increase in reported Coronavirus cases.

DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: We're now seeing a disturbing surge of infections. The next couple of weeks are going to be critical in our ability to address those surging that we're seeing.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KAFANOV: New weekly infections are on the rise in at least 26 states, including California, recording 5,000 new cases, its highest daily count since the start of the pandemic. Here in Texas, one of the first states to begin reopening, Governor Greg Abbott now says it's possible restrictions will be back.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GOV. GREG ABBOTT (R-TX): Because the spread is so rampant right now, there is never a reason for you to have to leave your home unless you do need to go out. The safest place for you is at your home.

FAUCI: I still think there is a reasonably good chance that by the very beginning of 2021, that if we're going to have a vaccine that we will have it by then.

KAFANOV: Now, U.S. Health officials warn that the recent surge in cases is largely being fueled by younger people in their 20s, 30s and 40s. Here in Texas the Governors now empower local authorities to try to restrict the number of people gathering publicly, especially if that group of people is numbering at 100 or more. Kim?
BRUNHUBER: All right. The European Union is considering banning travelers from the United States and several countries. So I want to talk more about this with International Diplomatic Editor Nic Robertson in London. So Nic, first of all we've just heard from U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his reaction to his possible ban. So let's listen to that.
[11:05:00]
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETATY OF STATE: We certainly don't want to reopen - jeopardizes the United States from people traveling here. And we certainly don't want to cause problems any place outside. I'm very confident in the coming weeks we'll figure that out as between not only the United States and the EU, but the United States and other parts of the world too.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BRUNHUBER: And all over the branch of sorts, Nic. You can imagine diplomats working away feverishly to stave off what could be possibly a huge economic blow. But this is far from a done deal, so take us through where we are right now.
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Yes, far from a done deal. European Commission or European Union Ambassadors today met to discuss the criteria by which the European Union should advise its member nations that they should agree on what the thresholds should be to allow people into the European Union.
The borders are opening up internally within the EU. But the criteria as they're seeing now, and one of the biggest ones is reciprocity, and that is if a country is putting a block on EU citizens visiting them as the United States is right now, that's a key test. So at the moment the United States fails that test.
And the other thing is the testing for COVID cases and the numbers of COVID cases in any other country. Is there an equivalency between where the EU is at or where the other nation, in this case, the United States, would be?
And currently there isn't, frankly. The European Union on average has about 15 COVID cases per 100,000 people. Compare that to the U.S. where it's about 106-plus per 100,000. So you can see that there is a lot more COVID- 19 presence in the United States than the European Union. So that again, it's a real reality check for the EU.
The EU is very concerned about the possibility of a second wave. Its primary concern is for the health of its citizens. It needs to stand business back up, and despite the fact there is over $800 billion worth of business done backwards and forwards between the EU and the U.S. Annually, that's not, in and of itself, big enough to make the EU throw caution to the wind.
So at moment, as it stands, though no countries are on or off any list at the moment, that's what EU sources tell us. But at the moment the facts are not stacking up favorably in the U.S. favor at all to come to fair Americans that come to the EU.
BRUNHUBER: Well, that's right. I mean, this is a huge black eye for the U.S. in terms of prestige. Even just talking about it, it hasn't come to pass, but just talking about it is a real condemnation of the way the country has handled this crisis.
ROBERTSON: Yes. What we're being told here is this is not a political decision on any part by the EU. They're not trying to put the U.S. down because President Trump early in March stopped EU citizens traveling to the United States. That's not the picture, it is all about health.
Now one of the problems that face the EU of course internally as 27 member nations that is getting everyone to agree on those different positions. Now what the European Commission does is, give advice on what those criteria are, but it's up to the individual member nations to make up their own decisions on who they allow into their countries.
Take Portugal, for example. Long, historic, deep, deep ties with Brazil. Brazil has a death rate right now of about 183 per 100,000. But Portugal is currently allowing Brazilian citizens into Portugal. Portugal can make its own decisions.
So there are a lot of ramifications, a lot of details here, you know, that play into the bigger picture decision making. But it is, at the end of the day, up to the individual EU nations to make their own decisions. But they're trying to work collectively, because they believe collectively that's how they keep the health of half a billion EU citizens.
BRUNHUBER: You're right, thanks so much Nic Robertson in London. Mexico is seeing another daily record of new Coronavirus cases that brings the case count in the country to nearly 200,000. The health ministry there says there were 6,288 new cases Tuesday, and the virus death toll is also climbing to more than 23,000.
Adding to the misery, patients have to be evacuated after a powerful earthquake struck south of the capital Tuesday. Our Matt Rivers is in Mexico City with the latest. Matt, obviously, it continues to be a huge worry. What's the latest there?
MATT RIVERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Kim, what we're seeing is just an outbreak in Mexico that just does not show any signs of slowing down.
[11:10:00]
RIVERS: I mean it was yesterday as you mentioned. This is the first time that Mexico has recorded more than 6,000 cases in a single day since this outbreak began. And remember, Mexico is testing at a far, far lower rate than what most epidemiologists would tell you is necessary to truly understand the amount of cases that actually exist in a country.
And we've had health officials in Mexico tell us personally that the actual case number, which stands just now stands just shy of 200,000, it could be ten times higher than that at the end. So the outbreak here is just not slowing down, and the death toll is also particularly worrisome.
You know, there have been more than 2,500 recorded deaths in just the last three days, and where it goes from here, we don't really know. But what we do know is that the economy in Mexico is slowly being reopened.
I was out doing stories yesterday, and there are a lot more people out on the streets, there's more businesses that are reopening. And when that happens, the obvious risk is that the outbreak just gets worse than it already is right now.
And not to mention that earthquake which could have been far worse, damage very slight as a result of that earthquake despite the fact that it was a 7.4-magnitude earthquake, we felt the shaking violently here in Mexico City.
Thankfully not a lot of damage, not a lot of reported injuries, but I did see a lot of people who are forced out on to the street yesterday standing right to each other not wearing masks.
BRUNHUBER: Now there was an interesting case. Premature triplets tested positive for COVID-19 despite the fact that their parents didn't have it. Tell us about that.
RIVERS: Yes, very unusual, and I think this is just a great example of how little is still known, how much there is to be learned about this virus? This particular case, this is a set of triplets born prematurely in the Mexican State of San Luis Potosi. And what happened was doctors say that, all three triplets tested positive for COVID-19, all thankfully are in stable condition at the moment.
But neither parent tested positive for COVID-19, so doctors say they're not sure how the triplets contracted the virus? They're examining multiple different possibilities on how this spread, but they're just not sure. And they say that this is highly relevant to the scientific community as it studies the behavior of this virus, which clearly we still don't understand, you know, in its entirety.
BRUNHUBER: Yes, it's not the first time this type of thing has happened, but still very interesting scientifically. Thanks so much, Matt Rivers, in Mexico City. In the last hour, David Nabarro, a special Coronavirus envoy for the World Health Organization, spoke to Hala Gorani about the importance of staying vigilant as countries open back up.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DR. DAVID NABARRO, W.H.O. COVID-19 SPECIAL ENVOY: Please take this virus really seriously. It hasn't gone away. It's very much there. Please respect what the public health folk are telling you to do. They're saying it for a reason. Please protect yourself and others, maintaining physical distance, wearing a mask when you're in public places, and if you're not at all well, don't go out.
It's really important that we recognize that this virus is dangerous, and we've all got to work to get on top of it. I really ask everybody in the U.S., and indeed, everybody everywhere to go on taking this virus seriously. Please.
HALA GORANI, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: So do you think some of these states opened too quickly, or in the case of the United Kingdom, for instance, with pubs and restaurants scheduled to open on July 4th, do you think all of this is a bit too soon?
NABARRO: I just want to make sure that as countries reduce their lockdowns and improve opportunities for people to move, that they're clear with their people on what are the basic steps that we all have to take to avoid the risk of infection.
And that they've got strong defenses in every community, so that if outbreaks do build up, they're dealt with quickly and efficiently. It really is important that the messages are clear and that the basics are in place. Then you can, of course, release the lockdowns. You can encourage movement, because you know what you're doing.
And it is important to continue testing because that's the only way you know where the virus is? We're dealing, frankly, with an enemy. It's an unseen enemy, and we need to do everything possible not to let the enemy actually defeat us, and it defeats us if we don't take it seriously.

BRUNHUBER: Important words to remember as nations around the world continue to reopen their economies. And please stay with us. Coming up at the half hour, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is set to make an important announcement.

BRUNHUBER: And we're going to have that for you in about 15 minutes. Coming up, the company responsible for this stunt at an English soccer match is now grounded and could face even more consequences those details ahead.
BRUNHUBER: A U.S. appeals court has ordered a lower court to dismiss Michael Flynn's case which effectively exonerates him if there are no more appeals. President Trump's Former National Security Adviser pleaded guilty twice to lying to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian Ambassador.
Last month the Justice Department moved to dismiss the case, but the trial judge asked for a review of the decision. The appeals court found that the judge didn't have enough reason to question the Justice Department's decision.
A U.S. police officer involved in the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky has been fired three months after her death. Detective Brett Hankinson received a letter of termination on Tuesday, where those police chief says, he found Hankinson's conduct to be ""A shock to the conscience"".
Taylor, a 26-year-old black emergency worker was shot eight times after police broke down her door in an attempt to drug sting. No drugs were found and none of the officers involved have been charged.
In the UK, local airport officials outside Manchester, England have stopped all banner towing operations after a ""White Lives Matter Burnley"" banner flew over an English Premier League match on Monday. So here you can see that banner over the stadium in Manchester.
Police are looking into the incident. You may remember the league spoke out in support of the black lives matter movement. CNN's Phil Black brings us up to date.
PHIL BLACK, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Kim, police initially said they were investigating this incident, because they thought the banner and its message could be seen as widely offensive. But after looking into it, they decided no charges were appropriate.
Here in Burnley, people are talking about being offended so much as being really disappointed, frustrated by what they see is a deliberate effort to undermine anti-racism efforts in this town a deliberate effort to also mischaracterize black lives matter, as anti-white.
It was a powerful moment of reflection and protest. All the players from two English Premier League clubs kneeled against racism, demanding a wider understanding that black lives matter. Moments later in the sky above a deliberate well-planned effort to belittle that cause a small plane trailing the words ""White Lives Matter Burnley.""
In Burnley the next day, outside the club stadium, we find at least one other person proudly supporting that message, whatever it means.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
WAJID KHAN, BURNLEY, ENGLAND MAYOR: The people that did the banner, they had their way of thinking, but that way of thinking is being defeated consistently and persistently through people out there making a positive contribution.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BLACK: The people behind the banner don't speak for anyone in this pack. The players in this passionate family football match are all refugees who escaped the Syrian war and are now proud members of Burnley football club. There is a pretty consistent view here on those behind the banner. They're missing the point.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BLACK: When people say white lives matter, does that offend you?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: To be honest with you, it doesn't offend me, no. It disappoints me. And the reason for that is because I know how powerful the black lives matter movement is, and I know what they're trying to do. All they're trying to do is educate people.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BLACK: In Burnley, as around the world, people who believe in overcoming centuries of inequality are not seeking to devalue white lives. They just hope for a future where racial identity really doesn't matter.
So no criminal charges, but the club is determined to act and says anyone suspected of being involved in this stunt will be banned from future matches for life. In a town where the football club is a big part of the social fabric, it hopes that will be enough to deter people from trying anything like this again. Kim?
BRUNHUBER: All right, thank you. So all this week, we've been covering how race is viewed both inside and outside the U.S. A poll conducted by CNN found when it comes to race the views of black people and white people in the UK are profoundly different.
So, let's talk to Patrick Vernon. He's a social commentator and campaigner and has been at the forefront of several high-profile movements on cultural heritage and social justice in the UK over the last decade.
What struck me from that report that we just saw, aside from the ignorance of those responsible for the banner, you know, how the club and the city has come together? We saw yesterday the club captain made a powerful statement of unity. It's not something we've always seen from football players who hither to usually shy away from social issues. So, does the reaction to this incidence suggest we've reached an inflection point, do you think?
PATRICK VERNON, POLITICAL ACTIVIST, SOCIAL COMMENTATOR: I think - nearly over 20 years ago. But at the - often there has been this growing consensus and particularly in Premier League clubs and other sporting activities, about trying to stamp out racism and discrimination in the sports.
It's been a journey, it's got a long way to go - but I think it's supposed to move when you have clubs like Burnley who are willing to speak out in this way.
BRUNHUBER: Our poll highlighted what you know that, already knew the very desperate view that and black and white Britain's have in terms of the level of racism that's pervasive in society. And we've seen similar stark divisions here in the U.S.
But then after the death of George Floyd polls showed that those attitudes shifted remarkably quickly, the gulf between the two racists narrowed considerably. Our polling suggests that doesn't seem to have happened to any significant degree in the UK. So, why not, do you think?
VERNON: I think Britain - calling itself from being - more competitive than America. And I think a lot of people don't speak out as much as - compared to the American experience as well. So it's not that surprising, but at the same time, a lot of people suppress their experiences of discrimination.
And often people are traumatized by the experience of racism, so much so that they're not confident even to speak out, even on TV, radio or having a conversation or doing an opinion poll.
[11:25:00]
VERNON: And what was interesting around the black lives matter global movement when it came to Britain, it gave the permission for lots of black people in Britain, and white people, the permission to talk about their experiences of racism in the boardroom, in sports, in the housing projects, and the community, everywhere in terms of architect, in terms of museums, the pulling down of the Colston's statue. It released this permission to speak out, which I think is important.
BRUNHUBER: But on the other side, though, why do you think that white opinions seem to have calcified so much, and can anything change that?
VERNON: It's all about - it's about educating and unfortunately in Britain, most of our history, most of our education reinforces a certain type of perception of what Britain is? So in America, you probably see Britain as the royal family. You know, maybe some pop stars or maybe the other extreme, you know, working class people in England.
But there has been a black presence in Britain going back 2,000 years. Obviously majority of us came post Second World War, but some of them - ship, which was the emergence of much of racial Britain as we know today, especially places like London.
But in that context, everyone lives in the past. There is a cultural amnesia in British society they don't, for example, they don't make the connections between the links between the - of the slave trade and all the wealth and profits that were made in Britain. And that kind of cultural amnesia suppresses thinking what we were great, but that obviously how it became great.
BRUNHUBER: Well, hopefully that can change. Thank you so much for joining us, Patrick Vernon. Still ahead, accusations of a hoax are being thrown at NASCAR's Bubba Wallace after the FBI determined he was not the target of a hate crime the latest from Talladega, next.
BRUNHUBER: Welcome back to ""Connect the World"" in Atlanta. I'm Kim Brunhuber. The FBI has determined that NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace was not the target of a hate crime. Investigators say the noose found in his garage had been there since last October, months before Wallace was assigned that stall.
[11:30:00]
BRUNHUBER: According to NASCAR the rope was used to pull the garage door closed. Wallace the sports only black top circuit driver says he doesn't care how long it's been there it's still a noose. CNN's Nick Valencia joins us now from Talladega, Alabama. Nick is Bubba facing a backlash in our people accusing him of essentially crying wolf?
NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right you know some people have gone so far Kim as to accuse him of manufacturing this hoax. Briefly last night according to one of our reporters have been covering this Dianne Gallagher the #bubblesmollett a reference to Jussie Smollett and the controversy surrounding his or what some claim are false claims of a noose.
You know some people conflating that in equating Bubba Wallace to making false claims. He gave an interview last night to Don Lemon saying in his words that he's pissed that his integrity has been brought into question but he's been accused of making this all up.
In fact he was very clear last night and again this morning on ""New Day"" saying that he never saw on the news. It was a member of his team that saw it and they were so concerned that they elevated it to NASCAR officials.
And also he said that it wasn't until after the NASCAR President said that Bubba Wallace was the victim of a hate crime that Bubba Wallace took to social media to talk about what had happened? You know he says that this is part of a larger discussion surrounding the sport.
As we have been reporting he was leading the charge to remove the confederate flag successfully. We saw on Sunday fans setting up across in the Talladega, Superspeedway selling confederate flag memorabilia and it was a very troubling revelation or development I should say surrounding you know Bubba Wallace and his role in the sport when everyone learned about this noose.
But again we should mention the FBI and DOJ concluding their investigation saying that there was no hate crime video in fact posted on YouTube from 2019 shows that that noose as is being called by team Wallace was there in the garage.
NASCAR saying that there's actually no way that anyone could have known that Wallace was going to use that same garage. They are under fire this morning from fans who believe that they jump the gun in this hyper charged environment.
NASCAR however saying that they stand by what they did that this was the best possible outcome and that they are committed to providing an inclusive environment for everyone in their sports, Kim?
BURHUBER: All right. Nick Valencia thank you so much. Some new faces on the ballot and the new reality for primary voters in several U. S. states Tuesday. The Coronavirus pandemic led to a shortage of poll workers in Kentucky that vastly reduced the number of voting sites across the state.
The health crisis also triggered a big increase in mail in ballots in the states where it's allowed many of them are still being counted in Kentucky and in some hotly contested Democratic Congressional Seats in New York. Jeff Zeleny joins us from Louisville, Kentucky with the latest results there in Kentucky the movement - the nationwide movement for racial justice's has really changed the momentum of the primary there at least for the Democrats?
JEFF ZELENY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Kim, there's no question. Of course we've heard so many times the name Breonna Taylor. The 26-year-old EMT who was killed by Louisville police in March she has become one of the names that has been said over and over by protesters across the country. Well, she is from Louisville and her killing has affected this Senate primary challenge here.
Democrats were deciding yesterday at the polls who to support in the race against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell? So the outcome of the results from Tuesday's election is still unknown. Voting in the age of the pandemic is going to take some patients.
They are counting absentee ballots and mail in votes the result is likely to be known in a week or so. Who Mitch McConnell the longtime Republican Majority Leader from here will face but this is yet one more example of how the protests and the calls for racial justice are influencing U. S. politics as well here?
And we're also seeing so many other interesting developments from across the country in terms of outsiders versus newcomers. But the one that we have our eye on today is a North Carolina winner 24-year-old Madison Cawthorn a Republican not expected to win a Congressional Seat.
President Trump supported his opponent but he won that will be the youngest serving member of the House if he happens to win in November, Kim.
BURNHUBER: All right. Fascinating race we'll have to leave it there. Thank you so much Jeff Zeleny in Louisville, Kentucky. So happening right now New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is making an important announcement and he is joined by Governor Phil Murphy of neighboring New Jersey. So let's listen to him.
GOV. ANDREW CUOMO, (D-NY): --spread all through the community. So we had the highest numbers to deal with in the country. And you look at where we are now we did a full 180 degrees we went from the highest cases the highest viral transmission rate to some of the lowest rates in the country.
[11:35:00]
CUOMO: No one else had to accomplish as much as we had to accomplish in such a short period of time. No one else had to bend the curve as much as we had to bend the curve. And when people take a deep breath when the political rhetoric dies down, those are going to be the facts.
So I applaud my colleagues for doing an extraordinary job. We now have to make sure that the rate continues to drop, and that's what keeps me up at night, and I'm sure it keeps them up at night, so we have to make sure we're doing everything and we're diligent and our citizens are diligent.
We also have to make sure the virus doesn't come in on a plane again. Learned that lesson, been there, done that. So we're announcing today a joint travel advisory. People coming in from states that have a high infection rate must quarantine for 14 days, and we have a calibration for the infection rate, and any state that goes over that infection rate, that state will be subject to the quarantine.
It's only for the simple reason that we worked very hard to get the viral transmission rate down. We don't want to see it go up because a lot of people come into this region, and they could literally bring the infection with them. It wouldn't be malicious or malevolent, but it would still be real.
So we are jointly instituting that travel advisory today. Because what happens in New York happens in New Jersey happens in Connecticut. And I think it's right, and I think it's smart, and I'm glad we're doing it together.
We've done a lot of good things together, and hopefully we're on the other side of this mountain, and we'll continue to see the numbers go down, and we'll continue to see the economic activity go up. And with that I'm going to turn it over to my neighbor, Governor Phil Murphy.
Phil, thank you again for everything. Thank you for what you've done, not just for New Jersey, thank you for what you've done for New Yorkers. There is no doubt that our partnership has made it better for both states. So thank you very much, Governor Phil Murphy.
GOV. PHIL MURPHY, (D-NJ): Andrew, thank you. And I echo your words of thanks and deepest appreciation for the partnership with you and with Ned. You know, we live in the densest neighborhood in America. We've been clobbered by this virus.
No region in the country has paid a bigger price with the loss of brothers and sisters. We've lost just under 13,000 members of our New Jersey family. New York has paid an enormous price, Connecticut has paid a big price as well, and I can't thank you enough for your partnership, guys.
We need to do things right inside the four walls in our respective states. We need the Federal Government, but boy, have we needed our neighbors, and I can't thank you and Governor Lamont enough for your partnership and the spirit of teamwork in this extraordinary chapter in our state's and our nation's history.
This was a smart thing to do. We have taken our people - the three of us - these three states through hell and back, and the last thing we need to do right now is to subject our folks to another round. And this virus is risky enough on its own in terms of the potential to flare back up.
So doing something commonsense as this is to say to folks, listen, it's time for personal responsibility. If you've been in a state that has a high infection rate, do the right thing, and that is taking 14 days and self- quarantining. It's the right thing to do, it's the commonsense thing to do, it's the responsible thing to do.
So I'm honored to be alongside my fellow Governors today and support this notion whole wholeheartedly, and I know the details will come from the respective health departments on exactly what this means, but it's a really smart, commonsense step, particularly as the three states have really broken the back of this virus. Thank you again for everything and for having me today.
CUOMO: Thank you. Thank you very much, Governor Murphy. And again this I do believe we're all on the other side of the mountain, but we determine what happens. It's what our people do, it's our policies, and it's not over until it's over. And I think this will be - it will help us all. Thank you very much, Phil.
And our other colleague and partner, Governor Ned Lamont from Connecticut, Governor, thank you very much for your partnership, thank you for the personal support and personal friendship you've given me.
[11:40:00]
CUOMO: Nobody wanted to go through this but you see sometimes in life when the pressure is on you seeing the best and the worst in people and society. And I think we saw that here. And one of the high points one of the best facets that came out of this was strong people got stronger and stronger relationships got stronger.
And New York and Connecticut and New Jersey really stood together and I want to thank you very much. Governor Ned Lamont. Okay, technical glitch. Can we get Governor Lamont back? One second for Governor Lamont. Let me give you some details he arrived--
GOV. NED LAMONT, (D-CT): --on a jet airplane but it's not going to leave on a jet airplane. It only goes by working together with New York, New Jersey and the other states in our region to make sure that we maintain the protocols to social distancing the mass everything we have done successfully over the last few months to bring our positivity rate to less than 3 percent.
And I got to say I'm blessed to have you guys as fellow Governors as well as Rhode Island and Massachusetts. The northeast region is taking this seriously and that's allowed us as a region to power through and get our positivity rates very low but we're not an island.
And as we look around the rest of the country you know we've seen not just spikes but we've seen real community spread better than 10 percent positivity rate in a number of these states that we're talking about right now.
And if it was limited to you know the nursing homes or the prisons or something containable perhaps you would not be as concerned but right now we're seeing you know places within some of the states we have a positivity rate of 20, 30, 40 percent in many cases younger people folks who travel 18 to 35 who are maybe not at risk themselves but are highly infectious.
So you know working with them - over the last you know a week or 2 we reluctantly came to the conclusion that this is what we've got to do to make sure that our region stay safe and our states stay safe as we make sure that we can safely get our business back and our schools back up and operating you know this fall.
And we'll be monitoring this carefully. We've got the quarantine in place. We'll be doing publicity and social media. Reaching out to the travel agents doing everything we can to tell people you know if you come to Connecticut you come to New York you come to New Jersey you come safely and you follow the protocols starting with quarantine. And you feel great being with you guys.
CUOMO: Great. Governor Lamont same here, thank you very much. And hopefully we're on the other side and we stay on the other side. Governor thank you very much Ned thank you.
Okay let me give a couple of - more details on this. The infection rate formula will be 10 per 100,000 on a 7 day rolling average or 10 percent of the total population positive on a 7 day rolling average.
So any state that has an infection rate above that would require 14 day quarantine. As of today the states that are above that level are Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Washington, Utah and Texas.
That's as of today that the states themselves can change as the infection rate changes. And we will update daily what states are above that infection rate. But as of today those are the states that are above the infection right now again.
It's just common sense it's the spirit of community. If you're in a place that has a high infection rate we understand that and will help you any way we can and we been helpful in reaching out to every state across the nation.
But we don't want to see the infection rate increase here after what we've gone through and that's the 14 day quarantine. That is a uniform policy across the 3 states. Each state will be responsible for the enforcement of that policy within their state. Let me give you a couple of other facts as we hear on days 116.
[11:45:00]
CUOMO: The number of hospitalizations is 1071 that's the lowest level of hospitalizations we have seen since this nightmare began. And again when I say we're on the other side of the mountain sometimes I'm talking to myself.
I'm often talking myself but this is the mountain I'm talking about. We're on the other side. We're on the decline. We just don't want to see us reverse and we are at the lowest level we have been on hospitalization since this started.
We paid a very dear price for it. Our tests we did 58,000 test yesterday highest number of tests in the United States. Without the test you don't know where you are? We're at 1.1 percent positive. You can see the testing by region and all the regions are constant since the reopening including New York City which we're watching very carefully but we watch it on a day to day basis.
And right now all the numbers look good within New York City. We look at the numbers by Borough. We also look at the hot spots in the Boroughs. We know that there are some zip codes that are much higher than others have codes. So we also studied those hot spots zip codes.
The number of deaths is 17 today. This is right about where the lowest numbers have ever been. And again that's more great news and again we don't want to see these numbers reverse. Number of lives lost on the 3 day average again is just about as low as it's ever been.
So all the numbers are good what we doing works our approach has been vindicated. And the phase 3 opening by data works. I said from day one I think these states in this theory over handling it politically that people at a political theory of how to deal with the virus?
You can't have a political theory on how to deal with the virus? You can't, it's a virus. It doesn't respond to political theory. It response to science and data so we're going ahead with our metrics--
JOHN KING, CNN ANCHOR: The Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo what we haven't done this in awhile listens of the Governor's Coronavirus update. But an important announcement at the top of that briefing New York now implementing along with its neighbors New Jersey and Connecticut what the Governor called a Coronavirus travel advisory, a joint travel advisory between the 3 states.
And he said if you're coming from a state with a high positivity rate, a high infection rate of the Coronavirus right now they'll be a 14 day quarantine policy in place in each of those 3 states. The Governors talking about how important it is it is quite remarkable if you go back a couple months to the beginning what are we talking about?
How bad things were in New York in New Jersey and Connecticut? Those states now among the best in terms of performance in terms of lowering, flattening the curve, lowering the positivity rate in their tests and the like.
Let's bring in one of our public health experts to walk through this Dr. Saju Matthew is with us. And Doctor it is so striking when we had our first conversation months ago it was about New York, New Jersey Connecticut and New England which was the leading on the bad side of this going up the hill they are now in much better shape if you look at the map if you look at the testing?
If you look at hospitalizations, does this make sense the Governor listed he said it's a rolling standard obviously but as of today 9 states if citizens of 9 states if they were traveling into those states would have to quarantine themselves including Arizona, Florida and Texas which we all know are having what Dr. Fauci causes a dangerous surge right now?
DR. SAJU MATTHEW, PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERT: Hey John, always nice to be on your show. Listen I was absolutely thrilled to listen to Governor Cuomo that's exactly what we need as a leader. We need a leader who listens to the signs who made sacrifices who talked to his people on a daily basis.
And I'm actually really excited that he is going beyond that and not just celebrating early and saying listen we did all the hard work and we don't want the virus back in our state. So we're going to impose this restriction and it makes total sense.
Certain countries in Europe we're doing that in fact they're talking about not even letting Americans get into gear continent. So I commend Governor Cuomo and doing that and that is exactly the way to try to kill this virus.
KING: And one of the things he said there is without testing you don't know where you are? That's a very different message that we hear from the President of the United States. The President of the United States calls it a double edged sword and he keeps saying he's not joking even though staff said he never gave the order.
But he has said several times - he several times he's talked about asking for less testing so that the numbers don't look so bad as a scientist and a doctor that's the backwards approach right?
DR. MATTHEW: Exactly the backwards approach John. You know I've gone from being really sad frustrated to just being mad.
[11:50:00]
DR. MATTHEW: You know I'm absolutely beside myself now as a public health specialist that would be exactly the opposite of what we're supposed to do? I'm a Primary Care Physician John, if you came to see me how would I know if you have high blood pressure unless I check your blood pressure?
How would I know if you have diabetes unless I check your sugar? How do we know how many people have COVID-19 unless we test them? That is where it all begins. You have to test. You have to quarantine and you have to isolate.
And now with these 7 states John that are showing escalating soaring numbers of new COVID-19 cases you know the hospitalizations are going to follow. They're already there and that is a bad metric. And I was just talking to a colleague of mine here in Atlanta saying that listen there 20 million people that are unemployed.
We need to be able to maybe reach out to some of them and train them and see if they can help us with contact tracing because that's something that is absolutely lacking in this country. It's not enough to tell somebody you have COVID-19. You have to also tell them to isolate. We have to contact trays everybody that they've been in contact with going backwards and forwards as well.
KING: The challenge obviously continues a big import announcement from New York Connecticut and New Jersey today. Dr. Matthew I appreciate your insights as always thank you so much.
DR. MATTHEW: Thank you John.
KING: Quick break, we'll be right back.
[11:55:00]
KING: A grim economic forecast today from the International Monetary Fund. The IMF says global growth this year expected to shrink to its lowest point since the Great Depression. CNN's Richard Quest joins us now with more on that pretty bleak outlook Richard?
RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR-AT-LARGE: Extremely, it cuts us perfect outlook is the way the fund describes it John. And there are two sides of the equation. This year will be worse than expected. The actual downtown will be worse and next year the uptick will not be as good as they'd hoped.
And there are two reasons first of all simply they undervalued the number so far. But more worryingly they now expects social distancing and mitigation measures to have to be further and longer and deeper than originally and not that's why John if you look at the way they define this.
What's happened is happened but the worrying part is what goes on forward? When you're seeing this today you're seeing it in the news from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut the sort of announcements that are taking place in this country at the moment.
They are going to make recovery harder because the situation is worse than expected not just here but elsewhere and that's why the IMF says this is a catastrophe.
KING: Catastrophe, look at those numbers on the screen. Global growth shrinking like that if this tough stretch and a long stretch ahead of us that will be tough. Richard Quest I very much appreciate the reporting there.

The incident occurred at noon on Monday, August 17 while Black 37-year-old jogger Tiffany Johnson crossed the northeast corner of 53rd Place and Broadway in Woodside, Queens, a neighborhood between Astoria and Jackson Heights.
At the time, a white woman—described by the NYPD as ""40's, light complexion, approximately 5'5"" tall, weighing 160 lbs., with blue eyes and long blonde hair""—threw a glass bottle at Johnson's feet and then proceeded to yell racial slurs at her.
According to Johnson, the woman yelled, ""Get out of here! Go back to Africa, [n-word]."" Though Johnson briefly stopped to engage the woman, she continued to run away as the woman allegedly pursued her onto the next block.
Johnson told ABC 7 NY that although some nearby people tried to tell the white woman to leave her alone, Johnson feared the encounter would escalate, partly because of the adrenaline pumping through her own body.
Unbeknownst to both women, someone had recorded the incident. Johnson saw video footage of the incident on social media a few days ago and then contacted police since she now had proof of the attack.
In a public Facebook post, Johnson wrote, ""Racism is truly real and alive even in a diverse area like Astoria/Woodside Queens, NY.... I was jogging in 98 degree weather minding my business.... As a black woman I'm always cautious bc i know that the color of my skin is triggering for certain people.""
""Racism is being perceived as a threat due to the color of my skin.... whether jogging or bbq or walking in a hoodie, somehow a human being whose skin color is brown is a threat, therefore force and violence is okay,"" she continued. ""And however we react in response is somehow problematic.""
The NYPD has asked anyone with information to call the Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA (74782). The NYPD told Newsweek that no suspects have been arrested as of Thursday evening.
This video-recorded incident is just the most recent one to go viral in New York City.
In May, a white woman named Amy Cooper was caught on camera calling the police on a Black man named Christian Cooper (no relation) after he asked her to put her dog on a leash as required by Central Park rules. Upon seeing video of the incident New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called the woman's reaction ""racism, plain and simple.""

The 1994 book was believed to be one of the first to explore same-sex love stories in the hip-hop community
Jussie Smollett is making his comeback in the film industry after his alleged fake hate crime scandal, but this time the actor is stepping behind the camera. 
DailyMail.com spotted the former Empire star back to work in Manhattan and on set of a new movie he's directing called B-Boy Blues. 
Smollett, 38, was seen wearing a mask with headphones around his neck, a bright yellow beanie and colorful camouflage jacket with the words 'born to win' and 'freedom here' emblazoned on the front. 
And while many may have thought his career was over after being accused of staging a racist and homophobic attack on himself last year in Chicago, it appears Smollett has found a home in Hollywood in the director's chair. 
Smollett was seen with a full cast and crew in Manhattan as he was directing the film adaptation of James Earl Hardy's 1994 book B-Boy Blues starring Ledisi, Brandon Evans and Broderick Hunter.
While there is no word if Smollett is planning on starring in the film himself, production began on October 17 in New York City. 
B-Boy Blues centers on the complicated relationship between two black men, one a journalist and the other a bike messenger. The book was believed to be one of the first to explore same-sex love stories within the hip-hop community. 
The novel was a finalist for the 1995 Lambda Literary Award for Best LGBT/Small Press Title, which Hardy himself had also adapted for the stage in 2013.
Smollett will also serve as a producer on the film alongside Hardy, Tom Wilson, Frank Gatson, Sampson McCormick and Madia Hill Scott. 
Smollett is producing through his newly-formed SuperMassive Movies brand, an off-shoot of his Story Worthy Pictures company.
The actor-producer has teamed with Wilson, a Cleveland-based investor, to secure 'mid seven figures' in funding that will be used to finance projects from minority filmmakers.
While B-Boy Blues marks Smollett's feature directing debut, he did direct two episodes of Empire back in 2018.
The actor, 38, hasn't been seen much since pleading not guilty to allegations that he lied to police about the hate crime incident. 
But in an interview last month he said that the case is 'frustrating' and said he does not think the case will be finished soon. 
Speaking for the first time since February 2019, in an interview with author and academic Marc Lamont Hill, 41, the former Empire star revealed his lawyers filed a motion against his indictment, which will be reviewed by a judge later today. 
'It's been beyond frustrating, and I certainly am not going rogue,' he said about publicly commenting on the case. 
'I'm still taking the advice of my attorneys and everything like that, but I don't really see, honestly, what staying quiet has really done, like, where it has gotten me. ... It's so much bigger than me.'
Smollett, an openly gay Black actor, was originally indicted in March 2019 with 16 counts of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false report claiming two men attacked him on January 29, 2019, while also making racist and homophobic slurs.
He pleaded not guilty to allegations that he lied to police about the incident, which authorities later claimed he had staged with two acquaintances to draw attention to himself. 
These were later dropped by the office of Cook County State's Attorney. 
In February Smollett pleaded not guilty to a six-count indictment which revived the disorderly conduct allegations previously filed and then dropped in the case. 
Smollett has consistently denied any wrongdoing.
Speaking on Lamont's Instagram, he said: 'I'm going to give it up to God, but if I'm being completely honest, I don't think that... they're not going to let this go.
'There is an example being made and the sad thing is there is an example being made of someone who did not do what they are accused of.
'On one hand, when I step back, I see how [Chicago Police] played the narrative, the way that they served it to the people. That it was intentionally created to make people doubt from the very beginning.
'From the very, very beginning, it was made to seem that I was lying about something or everything. But at the same time, I'm not really living for the people who don't believe.'
The city of Chicago have requested that the FBI hand over records of their own probe into Smollett's case.

 Re ''Hate Crimes at Highest Since 2008, F.B.I. Reports'' (news article, Nov. 17):
 For nearly three decades, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's reporting on hate crimes statistics has consistently provided the most comprehensive snapshot available of bias-motivated criminal activity in the United States. Still, it remains clear that the agency's yearly statistics understate the true number of hate crimes committed in our country.
 Underreporting is attributable to numerous factors, including a lack of political leadership, inadequate training and a failure by some agencies to prioritize tracking and to comprehensively identify and record hate crimes.
 It is hard to fix a problem without quantifiable data. At a time of rising hate in the United States, Congress must act swiftly on the Khalid Jabara and Heather Heyer National Opposition to Hate, Assault and Threats to Equality Act of 2019 (''No Hate'' Act), a bill named for two recent victims of hate crimes.
 The legislation would significantly enhance the accuracy of the F.B.I. statistics by authorizing new funding and support for state and local governments to encourage more robust reporting. With the best data in hand we can work to identify and counter the sources of hate crimes and provide better assistance to victims.

The first disaster in a year of perpetual crises hit the New York Police Department in March, when the virus tore through the force, killing dozens and sickening entire detective squads.
Soon, the courts ground to a halt. By June, hundreds of officers were reassigned to cover mass protests against police brutality and racism, where police and protesters sometimes clashed violently. By August, gun violence was surging. And as December drew to a close, New York’s 447 homicides made 2020 the city’s bloodiest year in nearly a decade.
The hobbled criminal justice system strained to contain the rise in violent crime driven by the pandemic’s society-wide upheaval.
“I can’t imagine a darker period,” Police Commissioner Dermot F. Shea said in a year-end briefing with reporters on Tuesday, citing the confluence of the pandemic and the protests.
The year’s crime numbers give shape to 2020’s tumult: Transit crime and grand larceny, often the stealing of laptops or iPhones of straphangers, plummeted as trains emptied out. But burglaries and car thefts spiked in a hollowed-out city. And bodegas, neighborhood staples during the throes of the pandemic, saw an increase in robberies and shootings.
By summer, the frustrations of shutdowns and economic collapse had burst onto the streets. Shootings had doubled, and most of them were concentrated in the areas hardest hit by the coronavirus and unemployment.
The increase in violence resembles trends in many big U.S. cities, where shootings and homicides have risen even as the pandemic has driven down other crimes.
“We’ve never had a year like this in policing, when you’ve had a combination of a worldwide health epidemic and a challenge to community trust,” said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the nonprofit Police Executive Research Forum. “That has been a combustible mixture. And the police in many ways were not prepared.”
Commissioner Shea said Tuesday that the department was caught flat-footed this summer when tens of thousands of protesters took to city streets after the killing of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers. The demonstrations kicked off a national debate about policing in America and led many departments, including New York’s, to slice budgets and redirect funding to community programs.
“There’s things that we probably should have done years and years ago,” Mr. Shea said, noting that the department had spent the months since June retraining many patrol officers and rethinking its approach to protests.
Dozens of incidents were recorded of police officers brutalizing demonstrators, many of them peaceful, during protests. The state attorney general kicked off an investigation into the department’s aggressive enforcement. And earlier this month, a city watchdog chided police officials for being unprepared and out of touch with the current discourse about police brutality.
Police officials in New York have pointed to gang disputes as a key driver of the violence over the summer, but several bystanders were caught in the cross hairs: a 43-year-old mother, killed by a stray bullet that went through her bedroom window in Queens; a man fatally shot on a handball court in Brooklyn; a 1-year-old boy, dead after a gunman opened fire on a cookout, also in Brooklyn.
But many cases were stalled because the pandemic had forced the courts to operate virtually. Hardly any new trials were conducted, and the progress of many cases was significantly slowed.
“I think we’ve struggled a little bit because of Covid, and how courts were closed, but when things start opening up, we have a lot of great work in the hopper ready to go, to really close some of the violence that we saw in 2020,” said Rodney Harrison, the Police Department’s chief of detectives.
Combating street feuds has become a sort of routine for the police, particularly in the warmer months when turf battles and social media fights can lead to spikes in gun violence in certain neighborhoods. But officials and experts have said that something about the summer’s violence felt less predictable, and that made anticipating trends more difficult.
“I think it’s about something more, something out there about the anxiety, and the fact that a lot of our institutions are not functioning the way they usually do,” Mr. Wexler said of the violence. “If it was just New York, I think that would be one thing. But because the crime increase in homicides is widespread, I think it says something bigger about what’s going on.”
Despite the violent summer, crime numbers in the city remained well below the dark days of the 1980s and 1990s, when New York saw more than 2,000 murders a year. Homicides and shootings have plummeted in recent years, even in some of the city’s most notoriously dangerous corners. Had 2020 not been such an anomaly, officials have said, that trend might have continued.
This year, as crime increased, the police solved less of it. Police Department records, for example, showed that officers solved 26.3 percent of serious crimes in the second quarter of the year; department figures show that 35.8 percent of serious crimes were solved over the same period in 2019.
“I think Covid played a role earlier in the year, where we had a significant amount of people out,” Commissioner Shea said, noting that in the early days of the pandemic when many officers became sick, entire teams of detectives filled in for other squads, often in unfamiliar neighborhoods. The clearance rate improved from 26.3 percent later in the year, he said, but still fell well short of 2019’s level.
Critics of the police have questioned whether officers, chafed by the summer’s unrest and the national debate over law enforcement, began responding more slowly to calls. But some experts say much of the department’s low clearance rate is tied to difficulties caused by the pandemic — officers cannot interact as widely with the public, and most people, including criminals, are wearing masks.
“It’s convenient that everyone is wearing masks now,” said Christopher Herrmann, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan. “Obviously that adds to the anonymity aspect of being a criminal.” But, he added, the factors of the pandemic and the backlash against the department — budget cuts, shorter staffing and sick colleagues — had probably hurt officers’ morale.
“Cops are kind of tiptoeing around. They’re not as proactive, they’re not as aggressive,” Mr. Herrmann said. “They’re not doing their job as well as they normally do.”
The number of hate crimes reported to the police also decreased sharply, with complaints down about 40 percent in 2020 after several years of steady increases. Much of the decline can be attributed to a 47 percent drop in reported anti-Semitic incidents.
But despite the decline, officials contended with a rise in incidents against Asian-Americans that they said were linked to the pandemic. The department began tracking coronavirus-related hate crimes this year, covering incidents in which a person was targeted because of bias connected to the virus.
So far, the authorities have tracked 25 virus-related crimes this year, a large number of them involving victims of Asian descent. (The department has also recorded 21 incidents as “anti-other” incidents, some of which they say may involve virus-related anti-Asian crimes.) In August, the Police Department created an anti-Asian hate crime task force to address the increase in attacks.

Karan Aggarwala, 53, is charged with harassment, criminal trespass and making graffiti for what authorities said was leaving a sexually explicit and anti-Semitic note and splashing white paint on the Manhattan district office of Assembly Member Rebecca Seawright, the New York Post reported.
He was arrested Wednesday and released without bail, the newspaper reported.
Seawright asked the police to investigate the graffiti and note left on Aug. 11 as a hate crime.
In an interview with the newspaper, Aggarwala acknowledged leaving the note and graffiti and said he was angered by an alleged fundraising appeal Seawright's office published that included a reference to a synagogue.
“You think it’s totally good practice for a secular state, a public political nominee, to present a religious affiliation on the same page as their fundraising effort?” Aggarwala told the newspaper.
Civil rights organizations tracked a record number of acts of vandalism, harassment or assaults motivated by anti-Semitic views in 2019, many of which took place in New York City. The most deadly attacks included the shootings at the Chabad of Poway synagogue near San Diego and at a kosher market in Jersey City.
Seawright hosted a virtual town hall on fighting anti-Semitism last month and held a similar forum last year after swastikas were found on a nearby fitness complex."

During the attack on September 27, Tadataka Unno was exiting the West 135th Street station in Harlem when he was confronted by a group of young people blocking the turnstiles, according to a police report.
Police said that after Unno tried to avoid them, he was pushed from behind and two people began yelling at him.
""I had no idea why I was shoved. One of them pointed at me and said, This guy just pushed me' to her peers. This was not true,"" Unno wrote in a statement to CNN. ""One of the others said, 'She's pregnant,' as if to imply that I had just attacked a pregnant person.""
One male began beating Unno, followed him, and continued to attack him, causing Unno to fall to the ground. As he fled the station, the group followed him, beating him repeatedly while bystanders watched.
Unno says that the group called him a ""Chinese m*therf**ker.""
""I felt like they were hitting me to release stress,"" Unno wrote in his statement. ""It felt like they were just hitting me until they felt done, and that they would continue to beat me until I was either unconscious and severely injured, or dead.""
Unno thought he was going to die, he wrote, until he began thinking of his wife and 4-month-old son ""and thought that I couldn't die."" A nearby woman then intervened and called an ambulance, Unno wrote.
Unno said he suffered a complex fracture in his shoulder and arm, which required an operation. He is completely unable to use his right arm, which he relies on for his livelihood as a jazz pianist.
""I might never play again,"" he wrote. ""The trauma, both physical and mental, are severe, and I have no timeline for a full recovery.""
No arrests have been made, according to the NYPD.
Unno is a jazz pianist and composer who has played at the Kennedy Center as well as New York jazz clubs including Village Vanguard, Dizzy's Club, and the Blue Note. Unno has lived in New York City since 2008, according to his website.
A note on his website reads: ""Thank you everyone for your prayers, love and tremendous support for Tadataka and Family.""
Unno recovering from surgery
Jerome Jennings, a longtime friend of Unno and the conductor of The Juilliard School's jazz orchestra, started a GoFundMe page that has raised more than $122,000 as of Sunday evening, well above the original $25,000 goal.
Unno is currently recovering from surgery, his wife Sayaka told CNN.
Jennings says that most of the GoFundMe donations were between $5 and $100, and stemmed mainly from the jazz community, which has been hard-hit by Covid-19 restrictions.
""I'm deeply grateful for this. In a difficult time, this support is like a shining light for me,"" Unno wrote in his statement.
Jennings said that, in the wake of the attack ""everybody showed up for Tadataka,"" who he described as ""a kind, beautiful person.""
""I thought that was just a testament to his character and also a testament to the people doing the right thing,"" Jennings said. ""We need all the slivers of light as possible.""
In August, the NYPD announced the creation of an Asian Hate Crime Task Force after an increase in racist attacks against Asian Americans during the Covid-19 pandemic.
""I was astonished by how many messages I've gotten from Japanese people, who say they have had very similar experiences in the past, and that they empathise with the pain and the fear,"" Unno wrote, adding he at least partly attributes the attack to anti-Asian sentiment due to what he says are President Donald Trump's ""words that cast Chinese people in a negative light.""
""This incident made me feel deeply the issues of the social standing of Asians, and the marginalization we experience,"" Unno said.
The NYPD said it is not currently investigating the attack as a hate crime, but some local politicians have condemned the attack for being motivated by hate.
New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer said in a tweet that the incident was ""horrific.""
""We can't tolerate acts of hate and we must fight bigotry on all fronts. My thoughts are with Tadataka Unno and his family as he recovers,"" Stringer said.
Rep. Grace Meng, who represents the 6th Congressional District in Queens, said in a Twitter post that the attack was ""hard to see...in the city where I grew up and am now raising my boys.""
""My thoughts are with Tadataka Unno and his family as he recovers. Hate -- against AAPIs and against any community -- has no place in New York,"" Meng said."

Governor Andrew M. Cuomo announced more than $17 million in federal funding has been awarded to 178 nonprofit organizations facing an increased risk of terrorism to strengthen the security of their facilities as well as enhance their overall preparedness. This funding, provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency through its Nonprofit Security Grant Program, is being allocated to New York through two separate awards -- $12.7 million for organizations within the New York City Metro Area and $4.3 million for organizations throughout the rest of the state. The New York State Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services manages these programs in close coordination with local stakeholders.
""The cancer of hate and division spreading across this country is repugnant to the values of diversity and inclusion we hold dear in New York State,"" Governor Cuomo said. ""This funding builds on the efforts already started by New York to help secure communities against hate and will enable organizations throughout the state to ensure they are protected against those seeking to do harm.""

Of this amount, $50 million in funding was made available to nonprofit organizations located within one of the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) designated high-risk urban areas. The remaining $40 million was reserved for jurisdictions outside of the UASI-designated areas.
In New York, the state's UASI-designated high-risk urban area is the New York City Metro Area. Specifically, this consists of New York City, as well as Westchester, Nassau and Suffolk Counties. In 2020, New York leads the nation in both total funding and number of awardees in a UASI-designated area, with $12.7 million being awarded to 130 nonprofit organizations.

121,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1/Files (250).DOCX","The New York Times",2020-07-10,"984 words","US","Michael Levenson and Sandra E. Garcia",NA,"Bodies of 2 Transgender Women Found in Badly Burned Car in Puerto Rico",FALSE,"Activists said that the women, who were from New York City, were the third and fourth transgender people to be killed in Puerto Rico in the last two months.
The bodies of two transgender women were found inside a charred car in Puerto Rico on Wednesday, outraging activists who said the killings were part of a disturbing history of violence against L.G.B.T.Q. people on the island.
Pedro Julio Serrano, a gay rights activist in Puerto Rico, said that four transgender people had been killed there in the last two months.
In the past 15 months, eight L.G.B.T.Q. people have been killed in Puerto Rico, he said. All of the deaths remain unsolved.
“This is an epidemic of violence, anti-L.G.B.T. violence that has resurfaced in Puerto Rico,” Mr. Serrano said Thursday. “We haven’t seen this type of violence in this quantity in a very long time — I would say 10 years.”
While the police were waiting for DNA results to release the names of the victims, they were identified by Mr. Serrano and other activists as Layla Peláez, 21, and Serena Angelique Velázquez, 32.
The women were friends who lived in New York City — Ms. Velázquez in Queens and Ms. Peláez in the Bronx — and had recently returned to Puerto Rico, according to family members and activists. They were planning to fly back to New York later this month.
The police have determined that the killings were homicides, but said they were waiting for autopsy results to determine how the women were killed.
Their remains were found after a person called 911 to report a burned car on a desolate road in Humacao, on Puerto Rico’s eastern coast, just before 5 a.m. on Wednesday, according to Capt. Teddy Morales, the chief of criminal investigations for the Puerto Rico police in Humacao.
Captain Morales said investigators were hoping to identify two men who partied with the women at one of their homes on Tuesday night. Images of the men were captured on one of the women’s social media accounts, he said. He said investigators were also reviewing security camera footage from businesses in the area.
The investigation is in its early stages, Captain Morales said. He added that just because the women were transgender “doesn’t mean it was a hate crime.”
“I can’t just say this is a hate crime from the scene,” he said. “We need to know who killed them, why did he kill, and what were the motivations to say this was a hate crime.”
Puerto Rico’s attorney general, Dennise N. Longo Quiñones, said the Puerto Rico Bureau of Police was working with prosecutors from the Puerto Rico Department of Justice to identify the perpetrators and their motive.
“Our investigation will include addressing any discriminatory animus that would qualify the crime as a hate crime, conduct which would be considered an aggravating sentencing factor in the prosecution of the underlying offenses,” Ms. Quiñones said. “We remain committed to bring justice to all victims of violent crimes in the island.”
Luz Melendez, 29, Ms. Peláez’s cousin, said Ms. Peláez was an easygoing young woman who had been raised by her grandmother and was just beginning to explore the world. On Wednesday, the grandmother recognized her granddaughter’s badly burned car on the news and called the police, Ms. Melendez said.
“In reality, we never thought something like this would happen,” Ms. Melendez said Thursday. “She didn’t have bad friends and she was never in the street. It caught us by surprise since she transitioned so easily and she didn’t ever have any issues.”
Ms. Velázquez’s family could not immediately be reached.
Ms. Velázquez and Ms. Peláez were believed to be the seventh and eighth transgender or gender-nonconforming people to have been killed in the United States this year, according to the Human Rights Campaign.
“Serena and Layla, like us all, had family, dreams, hopes — and they did not deserve to die,” said Tori Cooper, the director for community engagement for the Human Rights Campaign’s Transgender Justice Initiative. “Transgender and gender-nonconforming people, especially women of color, are too often the victims of a toxic mix of transphobia, racism and misogyny.”
In February, Alexa Negrón Luciano, a well-known figure on Puerto Rico social media who was transgender and homeless, was shot to death after a McDonald’s customer complained that Ms. Negrón had spied on her in the women’s room.
Ms. Negrón’s final moments — framed in the headlights of a car amid a cackle of laughter — were posted on social media, a fact that activists said underscored the impunity homophobic attackers feel when committing such crimes.
Last month, Yampi Méndez Arocho, a 19-year-old transgender man, was killed in Moca, P.R., according to the Human Rights Campaign.
Violence against gay people in Puerto Rico first gained wide attention in the 1980s, when a man called “Angel of the Bachelors” went on a killing spree, picking up gay men at bars and slaying them. But the police did not begin paying attention until a prominent journalist was stabbed to death in 1985, Mr. Serrano said.
The serial killer, Ángel Colón Maldonado, is serving a life sentence for three murders, but he has been suspected in 27 more cases. Fifteen years after his conviction, Puerto Rico legislators passed a hate crime bill, but prosecutors have rarely used it, Mr. Serrano said.
Mr. Serrano and other activists said they were concerned that the investigation into the killing of Ms. Velázquez and Ms. Peláez could be hampered by negligence and homophobia, which they said had plagued previous investigations of gay and transgender people killed in Puerto Rico.
“We are asking the police to thoroughly, immediately, and transparently investigate these vile and atrocious murders,” said Ivana Fred, an L.G.B.T.Q. activist in Puerto Rico. “Trans people deserve to live in peace, with equity and freedom.”

The anti-gay motive surfaced as suspect James Williams was indicted on a murder as a hate crime charge for allegedly knifing Brooklyn resident Massiah Berkley in Far Rockaway on Labor Day.
Berkley, 29, was sitting on a bench next to Williams in a small park on Beach 20th St. near Mott Ave. about 3:55 p.m. Sept. 7 when the older man called him a ""f---,"" sparking an argument, prosecutors said.
""The defendant's own words allegedly reveal that his bigoted perceptions sparked this deadly attack,"" Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz said. ""Violence is never an acceptable option, but violence spurred by hate and prejudice is uniquely abhorrent and will always be prosecuted by this office to the fullest extent of the law.""
During the fight, Williams pulled out a knife and stabbed Berkley in the chest and the back of the head, according to prosecutorrs.
Medics rushed Berkley to St. John's Hospital, but he could not be saved.
Williams, who claimed that he knew Berkley, was arrested a short distance away
""I pulled out a fishing knife and I [swung] it at Massiah a few times and hit him one time,"" Williams told cops at the precinct, prosecutors said. He also told detectives he threw the bloody knife over the fence of a nearby construction site.
""I've had multiple altercations with Massiah in the past,"" Williams told police.
Besides murder, Williams faces weapons possession and tampering with evidence charges. He will be arraigned on the indictment on Sept. 29 and faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted.
Berkley, a resident of Brownsville, made the trek to Far Rockaway to help his cousin care for her ailing mom, the young painter's heartbroken mom, Kim Berkley, told the Daily News earlier this month. The cousin did not witness the fight.
""That's why he was in Far Rockaway, so he could help [his cousin] take care of her mother, because her mother was in a nursing home,"" Berkley said. ""That's what he do, he help everybody. But nobody was there to help him.""
""My son is lying somewhere in a f--ing morgue right now with a tag on his toe, cold,"" she added as tears streamed down her face. ""For what? For what?""
Berkley was an artist who worked with Groundswell, a nonprofit that organizes local young people to create colorful murals to beautify neighborhoods and create social change.
One of the many murals he worked on is on the side of a vacant building on the corner of Pitkin Ave. and Strauss St., about 10 blocks from his home."

New York Times reporter Tim Arango jumped on what may be the paper's last chance to blame physical assaults against minorities on the president, in Tuesday's: 'Hate Crimes At Highest Since 2008, F.B.I. Reports[1].'The notorious, discredited Southern Poverty Law Center also had a feature role. Here was The Times's four lead graphs (click 'expand'): Hate crimes in the United States rose to their highest level in more than a decade last year, while more murders motivated by hate were recorded than ever before, the F.B.I. said on Monday.The sharp rise in homicides driven by hatred -- there were 51 last year, according to the F.B.I. -- was attributed in large part to the mass shooting in El Paso in August 2019. In that shooting, the authorities say a 21-year-old gunman motivated by hatred toward Latinos stormed a Walmart and killed 23 people and injured many more.The death toll in the El Paso attack more than doubled that of 2018's deadliest hate-motivated crime, the mass shooting targeting Jews at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.'It's important to note that, because of the nature of hate crime reporting, the F.B.I.'s annual report vastly understates the real level of hate crimes in the country,' the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups, said on Monday. 
Hmm. Let's look at just who The New York Times considers a reliable source of information on hate crimes: The discredited, fundraising obsessed hysterics at SPLC[2] actually put outspokenMuslim apostate Ayaan Hirsi Ali, who still relies on security against death threats from Islamic radicals, on its blacklist of hatemongers. (They withdrew the smear under pressure, and had to settle a lawsuit by another ex-Muslim unfairly placed on the list.)And when the SPLC labeled the conservative Christian lobbying group Family Research Council on a 'hate group' map, it caughtthe attention of Floyd Corkins[3], who stormed the FRC's headquarters on a mission of slaughter. (The Times ignored the connection.)It's no surprise who the paper blames for yet another alleged rise in hate crimes (which may be boosted by exploiting increased reporting during the term of a president loathed by the left): The upswing in hate crimes last year underscored the upward trend in bias-motivated crimes during the Trump era, and the harsh rhetoric against Latino immigrants was seen as motivating the gunman in the El Paso shooting.'Politics plays a role,' said Brian Levin, a professor at California State University, San Bernardino, and the director of the university's Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism.'The president's rhetoric has been identified in a series of actual attacks,' Mr. Levin added, 'but moreover the day-by-day ticks of F.B.I. hate crimes shows there are increases after sustained and fervent remarks by the president that enter into an online feedback loop that also ends up in other discourses, both at the water cooler and on television.' Whether reporters are seizing on the FBI's annual report or exploiting a tragic shooting, the Times has spent four years blaming Trump for ""hate crimes.""Peter Baker and Michael Shear made clear who they thought shared the blame[4] of the 2019 El Paso massacre in'In Texas Gunman's Manifesto, An Echo of Trump's Language."" They lamented that Trump 'uses the word 'aliens' to refer to immigrants long after it was deemed dehumanizing even by other Republicans[.]'A week later the paper filed a long front-pageinvestigative report[5]: 'How the El Paso Gunman Echoed The Words of Right-Wing Pundits.' Yet the paper made no mention of theradical environmentalist streak of the killer's manifesto. It even shared a title with a climate change documentary by Al Gore: 'The Inconvenient Truth.'Trump has also been held responsible for hate crimes against U.S. Muslims[6], said reporter Eric Lichtblau in 'Level of Hate Crimes Against U.S. Muslims Highest Since After 9/11 - Some Tie Attacks to Trump's Statements.'

124,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1/Files (250).DOCX","Thai News Service",2020-06-29,"1016 words","GENERAL NEWS",NA,NA,"United States: US Watchdog Tracks Over 2,100 Anti-Asian Incidents",FALSE,"Since mid-March, a U.S.-based coalition has tracked more than 2,100 anti-Asian hate incidents, a troubling figure that Asian American advocates say is being fueled in part by political rhetoric against China during the coronavirus pandemic.
While racial slurs and other forms of verbal harassment constituted the vast majority of the incidents, nearly eight percent involved physical assaults, businesses barring Asian Americans from entering their establishments due to misplaced coronavirus fears, and attackers coughing and spitting on victims, according to STOP AAPI Hate, an anti-Asian hate tracker.
In one incident in March, a group of African American teenagers on a commuter rail in San Francisco used their backpacks to attack a mask-wearing Asian American, saying he had COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
Chinese Americans raise funds for medical supplies despite rising racial threats
In another occurrence in April, a stranger threw a large rock through the atrium window of a Chinese American family's house in Santa Rosa, California. The house had Chinese writing along the front door as a blessing for good health and harmony.
These are first-hand accounts where individuals are describing harrowing and traumatizing experiences, including what is being said to them when they're being attacked, said Cynthia Choi, co-executive director of Chinese for Affirmative Action, one of the coalition partners.
Asian Americans have been targeted before during public health crises, as was the case during the 2003 SARS epidemic. The latest wave of anti-Asian hate comes at a time of heightened tensions over the pandemic fueled by the anti-China rhetoric of President Donald Trump and other politicians. Trump, who initially praised China for its handling of the crisis, subsequently blamed China's leader Xi Jinping for waiting weeks to report the outbreak in Wuhan to the World Health Organization and covering up the severity of the problem.
Trump has repeatedly referred to the coronavirus as the Chinese virus and kung-flu, terms that Asian American advocates say are derogatory and have exacerbated the scapegoating of Americans of Asian descent.
Trump disputes that those and other terms are racist. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, who several weeks ago criticized the phrase kung-flu as highly offensive, and press secretary Kayleigh McEnany both said this week that the president used the term merely to highlight that the virus originated in China.
But Asian American leaders say the meaning is not lost on their fast-growing community.
Those are terms meant to be humiliating, said Gene Wu, a Chinese American Democratic member of the Texas House of Representatives.
Bill Ting, a Democratic state assemblyman in California, said the rhetoric has had a direct impact on the surge in anti-Asian harassment and hate crimes.
You see leaders express words that really give license to other people to express those same sentiments and also to act on them, Tung said.
In a recent report examining the link between political rhetoric and anti-Asian bias, STOP AAPI Hate, the Asian American coalition, found that reports of anti-Asian discrimination spiked after Trump repeatedly used the term Chinese virus.
While the vast majority of the 2,100-plus incidents recorded by STOP AAPI Hate do not rise to the level of a hate crime as defined by statute, more than 100 do, according to legal experts.
The FBI reports there has been an uptick in hate crimes and harassment against Asian Americans since the outbreak of COVID-19, which first appeared in Wuhan, China, late last year
This surge in anti-Asian hate crime comes at a time when most American cities are reporting an overall decline in other categories of bias attacks, according to Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at the California State University.
The FBI defines a hate crime as a criminal offense motivated by bias against the victim's race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity
California, home to the nation's largest Asian American population, has been particularly hard hit. In Los Angeles, police recorded 10 anti-Asian hate crimes through April 30, compared to a total of four for all of 2019, according to police data compiled by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism.
In San Francisco, there were five anti-Asian hate crimes through March 31, compared to six for all of last year, according to police data.
Other major cities have reported far fewer cases of anti-Asian hate crimes. In New York City, police recorded just two incidents through May 17, compared with three for last year. In addition, there were 20 coronavirus-related hate crimes. In April, an Asian American woman in Brooklyn, New York, suffered second-degree burns after a man poured acid on her.
Jewish community has been most frequent target of hate crimes amid resurgence in anti-Semitism, according the report by Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism
One of the most horrific anti-Asian hate crimes came in March when a teenager stabbed an Asian American man and his two young children at a supermarket in Midland, Texas. The suspect reportedly carried out the attack because he thought the family was Chinese and infecting people with the coronavirus.
In the cities where anti-Asian hate crimes increased, they increased significantly to the extent that there were almost as much anti-Asian hate crime as we had for all of last year or significantly more, Levin said.
The surge in the crimes has not been limited to the U.S. From Melbourne, Australia, to Vancouver, Canada, Asian American communities have reported a surge in discrimination, harassment and assault.
In Vancouver, billed as the most Asian city outside Asia, there were 20 anti-Asian hate crimes through April 29, up from 12 for all of last year. London, another major city with a large Asian population, had 267 anti-Asian attacks, compared with 375 for all of last year.
This is a global pandemic of hate, said Helen Zia, a prominent Chinese American civil rights activist and author. -VOA"

Wong was told to reach out to the victim and talk to her and her family. He stated at the time he heard regarding the situation, he reckoned of his own grandmother.
He said, I was really just eager to help because you really feel for someone of that age to be victimized like this for no apparent reason. I just tried my best and did everything I could to make her feel comfortable using our native tongue, Cantonese, and just helping her with the process.
One of the goals of the Asian Hate Crime Task Force is to deploy officers of same backgrounds to the victims so they feel comfortable coming forward, and can use their native tongue to talk to investigators without going through an extra translator.
Wong, who is a first-generation immigrant himself said, It just makes it easier to have someone that speaks the language and it shows empathy because it's hard to convey that through a translator. Having someone that speaks the language and is of your background makes it a little bit easier for them to feel comfortable with going through the facts.
Loo informed that element was main point to cracking this matter. He said, She had initially told the investigator she wasn't too sure about the identity or the description of the perpetrator. When we got a chance to speak with her, she was very detailed in description and she was able to identify who was the one that assaulted her. So that was a good break in the case, and that eventually led to an arrest.
The matter is getting managed by New York City's Law Department. More details on the status of the cases against the minor males was not available. 2020 Legal Monitor Worldwide."

Aired 10:30-11a ET",FALSE,"[10:30:00] POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: No drugs were found, her family has filed a wrongful death lawsuit.
JIM SCIUTTO, CNN ANCHOR: Well, in an hour (ph), Senate Democrats are expected to block debate on the Republicans' version of a police reform bill. Democrats are instead planning to push forward with their own legislation in the House.
Both parties have been under intense pressure from the public to change law enforcement practices. This, of course, after the killing of George Floyd just last month in Minneapolis, other incidents as well.
Joining me now, Senator Ben Cardin, Democrat from Maryland. Senator, than you for taking the time this morning.
SEN. BEN CARDIN (D-MD): It's good to be with you, Jim. Thanks.
SCIUTTO: We had CNN Republican Mike Braun on the air this morning. He talked about his own proposal, which is introducing legislation to scale back qualified immunity for police officers. That of course is an element of police reform that Democrats want, not currently in the Republican bill. I wonder, do you believe that that Braun proposal could bridge the gap?
CARDIN: Well, I think we need to have discussions between Democrats and Republicans and have a base bill on the floor of the United States Senate that's truly a bipartisan bill, that makes a difference in policing in America. That's not where we are right now.
Leader McConnell's going to move forward with a vote today on the Scott bill, which is a partisan bill, it does not accomplish the objectives of fundamental reform and it's a way in which the Republican leader can check a box but not get anything done. So we need to start with a bipartisan bill.
SCIUTTO: But let's dig down a little bit more. Because when you look at the differences, they're not that vast, right? I mean, for instance, both the Democratic and GOP bills condition federal funding to local police departments on restricting chokeholds. The Democratic version adds a ban on chokeholds by federal officers, but most people interact, frankly, with their local police departments here. I wonder, is that not a place to find compromise? CARDIN: The bills are nowhere near similar, and they -- the Scott bill does not provide fundamental changes. It doesn't even outlaw all forms of chokeholds, it certainly doesn't establish national standards, it doesn't provide for the end of racial and religious discriminatory profiling, it doesn't have the -- deal with no-knock warrants, it doesn't deal with qualified immunity.
There are so many areas that it just doesn't deal with, which are the fundamental problems of policing in America. So, no, we believe -- and I must tell you, the stakeholders, the advocate community also agrees that the Scott bill would not make a fundamental difference in policing in America, it would be a lost opportunity if that's what we do.
SCIUTTO: I just wonder, though, because you do have two Democrats -- well, one Democrat, Doug Jones, and Angus King, of course, independent who caucuses with the Democrats -- who are willing now to vote to allow debate on this. We don't know how they would vote on a final bill.
But do you worry -- at the end of the day, you're going to need Republican and Democratic support in the Senate to pass something before November. Do you worry about taking a position here that you miss the moment, you miss the moment?
CARDIN: It's just the opposite. This is to take advantage of the moment. If we were (ph) proceed (ph) today, we will not get to a satisfactory conclusion. We're hopeful that we'll see Democrats and Republicans come together. Let's start off with a bill, we (ph) could work it through the Judiciary Committee and get Democrats' and Republicans' input, we could do it through just honest negotiations between the two parties.
Let's start off with a bill that we can be proud of, and then let's have an open amendment process and debate the issues, as the Senate traditionally has done in the past. That's not what's being suggested today. What's being suggested today is a process that is bound to lead to failure. It's a missed opportunity, so that's why we're standing up for principle at this moment.
SCIUTTO: I want to ask about another topic, because you have remarkable testimony taking place today. And that is two career Department of Justice prosecutors will testify under oath that on two major cases -- including a case involving the president's longtime ally, Roger Stone -- that there was direct political interference from the highest levels of the Justice Department to water down these cases.
And I just wonder, when you look at that and other instances under Attorney General Bill Barr, are you concerned that the attorney general is undermining the rule of law for politics?
CARDIN: Oh, absolutely. I'm very concerned about Attorney General Barr and his record as attorney general.
We have a proud tradition in this country of the independence of the Department of Justice, that the attorney general represents the people of this nation, not just the president of the United States. And we've seen, over and over and over again, the attorney general doing the president's political bidding rather than standing up for the independence of the Department of Justice.
So we're very concerned that this attorney general has led the Department of Justice in a very partisan political way, which is unprecedented.
[10:35:07]
SCIUTTO: Final question, because this news just broke moments ago. Michael Flynn -- of course the president's short-time national security advisor -- who pleaded guilty to lying twice, and lying about discussions with Russian officials during the transition, an appeals court, effectively saying the case is over.
I just wonder, what message do you believe that sends, in your view, given the lies, the pleading guilty to lies and the substance of what he was lying about?
CARDIN: Well, it's outrageous. But recognize this is more about the partisanship of the president, the attorney general and how they've led the Department of Justice than it is about one individual, Michael Flynn.
As I understand the appellate court ruling, it's just reaffirming the fact that the attorney general has the discretion on prosecution. Well, we understand that, but we expect him to exercise that with the independence that that responsibility is required. He has not done that.
So I think it's a condemnation of the attorney general, of the president. As the issue you mentioned earlier, that's going to be the hearing on -- in the House Judiciary Committee, and that is the politicizing of the Department of Justice. It's wrong.
SCIUTTO: Senator Ben Cardin, pleasure to have you on the program this morning.
CARDIN: Thank you very much.
HARLOW: All right, our next guest has been on the scene of 200 coronavirus deaths. The paramedic, with a warning for people as cities reopen. The virus is still out there.
[10:41:16]
HARLOW: Welcome back. A major step this week in New York City, once the epicenter of coronavirus, now cases trending downward and the city officially in phase two now of reopening.
But one paramedic has this warning. He writes, in ""The Washington Post,"" quote, ""We just had 20,000-some people die in this city, and already the crowds are lining back up outside restaurants and jamming into bars. This virus is still out there. We respond to 911 calls for COVID every day.
I've been on the scene at more than 200 of these deaths -- trying to revive people, consoling their families -- but you can't even be bothered to stay six feet apart and wear a mask.
TEXT: ... ""200 of these deaths -- trying to revive people, consoling their families -- but you can't even be bothered to stay six feet apart and wear a mask, because why? You're a tough guy? It makes you look weak? You'd rather ignore the whole thing and pretend...""
HARLOW: FDNY EMS Lieutenant Anthony Almojera joins us now. Thank you so much for being here. It's -- the work you do is remarkably important, and we've had you on over the months and we just appreciate your time. Could you just tell us more about what it is like right now for you guys with these reopenings?
ANTHONY ALMOJERA, FDNY EMS LIEUTENANT: It's a little nerve-wracking. Just to give you some context, this past week, two EMTs at my station tested positive for COVID. So the virus is definitely still out there. And, you know, to see people -- I want to reopen, I want people to get back to their lives. Nobody doesn't want that.
But to see people be haphazard with it, you see photos in the papers of everybody congregating, for us in the EMS community -- and I'm sure the rest of the health care workers -- seeing (ph) that is -- we're fraught with anxiety, you know? We just went through hell, trying to revive and take care of people, and we don't want to go through it again.
So to see it is really -- it's, you know, wear a mask, just wear a mask.
HARLOW: Yes, yes, it's a simple request.
You write in this piece, talking about being dispatched and seeing sort of the slow-moving stress that this can put on the heart for example, and the disproportionate impact on minority communities. And you said, ""I feel like watching a bomb go off in slow motion.""
ALMOJERA: Yes. It's -- you know, you would hope that when a bomb hits, you know, either you're free from it or you're obliterated by it, right? You don't want to feel it. But with this COVID in New York City, you felt every bit of that energy, and it took all of it out of you as a responder.
To sit there and go into home after home, trying to revive these people, and -- and console them -- you know, I always thought that I had an unlimited amount of empathy. You know, as a paramedic, you have to have some of that, you know, you think you have that. And COVID put that to the test. There is a limit.
HARLOW: Yes.
ALMOJERA: And so we watched it happen in these waves. And you think you get a little break, and here it comes again, you know?
HARLOW: Even before COVID, I mean, the job of an EMS, a paramedic, is very difficult for you guys. You personally have been shot, you've been beaten, you've been cursed at and you've been long calling for -- especially now -- hazard pay on -- being on the frontlines of this, which you haven't gotten.
But also just equal pay, because looking at the numbers -- and you note this -- EMTs are paid about 40 percent less than your colleagues in the FDNY and the fire department.
Mayor de Blasio said, look, we're not going to figure this out in the middle of a crisis, but we will address this after the crisis. And I know the city passed a resolution to get you equal pay, but it's nonbinding. Where does it go from here?
ALMOJERA: It's in the mayor's hands, you know? He's a mayor that preaches equality. And the thing that we can't understand at EMS is that we're 54 percent minority, we're 38 percent women, we're the most diverse 911 workforce. You would think somebody who would preach equality and see the work that we do, as a 911 service, with just the same dangers as the other two, would equalize us.
[10:45:25]
That would be an easy win for him. It's the stroke of a pen. We can't figure it out, to the point that, you know, in COVID, you mentioned earlier how it had a disproportionate impact on minority communities, the members that I represent live in those communities. We live in East New York, Brooklyn and the Bronx and uptown and in Queens, we live here. We don't have the funds to buy a house in other places.
So we filed a lawsuit to try and address the inequality, because it's got to be based on some type of discrimination which we feel, Hey, we're the most diverse workforce and we're not paid like the other, and we have empirical evidence that shows that, but you know. He could fix it tomorrow if he wanted to.
HARLOW: Could -- Anthony, just briefly before you go, I was so struck by the suicide rate and you note that you have had six EMTs and two additional EMT medics commit suicide since this pandemic started. You're very worried the mental health repercussions of this for your team are not being addressed.
ALMOJERA: Yes. So we've had five EMTs die of COVID, we've had two commit suicide, we've had others who express the desire to. And I believe in New Jersey, they had a member that committed suicide. The suicide rates are high to begin with in EMS and with COVID, it's going to get higher.
Unfortunately, this past weekend, Lieutenant Matt Keene, who we all knew and loved, shot himself. And it's a real tragedy because we know -- we're trying to manage this crisis. And to have PTSD diagnosed, it takes 30 days after the event. We're not after the event --
HARLOW: Right. ALMOJERA: -- there's no time to heal, you're constantly COVID, you're back in it. And then you have the protests and everything else, and then unfortunately, the mental health of EMS workers has been put off for far too long, even though the unions have tried to advocate to have an independent agency, outside of the fire department, taking care of the mental health that we so desperately need.
And, Poppy, if I may bring up one thing because this past weekend, this past week, we lost three members. We had one commit suicide, unfortunately, and we had two 25-year veterans pass away. And their families are reaching out for help. And if I can give the help fund that we have set up, to help EMS members, you know, because we don't get paid a lot and we had to set up this external fund to try and augment when people pass away or have emergencies.
If I may give that website?
HARLOW: Sure.
ALMOJERA: It's www.emsfdnyhelpfund.com. Every little bit you can donate will help, will go a long way to help the members of FDNY EMS.
HARLOW: Anthony, thank you for being here and for what you wrote and the work you and your team do every day. We appreciate it very much.
ALMOJERA: Poppy, thank you and CNN for having me on to get the message out about EMS. Stay well.
[10:48:32]
HARLOW: Sure. We'll be right back.
HARLOW: NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace tells CNN he is angered but also relieved after the FBI determined that he was not the target of a hate crime.
SCIUTTO: That's right. Federal investigators, they investigated. They say the rope found hanging in Wallace's garage at Talladega was, quote, ""a garage door pull rope fashioned like a noose,"" it had been there since 2019, long before Wallace used this garage.
CNN's Nick Valencia joins me now from Talladega Super Speedway in Lincoln, Alabama. So, Nick, what more do we know about the investigation and Bubba Wallace's reaction?
NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, the FBI and DOJ have wrapped up their investigation, Jim, as you mentioned, that they have concluded that there was no hate crime.
And Bubba Wallace was very clear in his interviews, last night and again this morning, saying that he wasn't the one that spotted what he's calling a noose, that it was actually somebody on his team that was so concerned by it that they elevated it to the NASCAR president. And it was only after the president had a pull-aside conversation with Bubba Wallace, that he took to, you know, social media to release a statement. You know, he was told by the NASCAR president, he says, that he was the victim of a hate crime.
He spoke again to CNN this morning, saying that he believes as though some Americans are bringing his integrity into question, and he's mad that people think that he manufactured this as a hoax.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BUBBA WALLACE, NASCAR DRIVER: Yes, there's no comparison there, just simply listening to the facts that was delivered to me. I was just, I would say, an innocent bystander but people won't buy that, and that's OK. I know what's true in my heart and in my mind. And the people around me know that's the truth, and I'll lay my head down at night, sleeping really good, knowing that I'm telling the truth.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
VALENCIA: Now, video that was posted on YouTube last year shows that noose, as it's described by Bubba Wallace, in that same garage, NASCAR saying that there's no way that anyone could have known that that same garage was going to be used by the Bubba Wallace team this week, when they were racing at Talladega.
NASCAR, also being criticized for jumping the gun here in a hyper- charged environment, some fans thinking that they went too far in their statement. They say that they're committed to providing an inclusive environment for everyone -- Jim, Poppy.
[10:55:10]
SCIUTTO: Nick Valencia, thank you for following and updating.
More than half the states across this country, now, are seeing an increase -- some of them quite sharp -- in coronavirus cases. This as top health officials say the virus is clearly not under control.

By Masood Farivar
June 27, 2020 11:15 AM
WASHINGTON - Since mid-March, a U.S.-based coalition has tracked more than 2,100 anti-Asian hate incidents, a troubling figure that Asian American advocates say is being fueled in part by political rhetoric against China during the coronavirus pandemic.
While racial slurs and other forms of verbal harassment constituted the vast majority of the incidents, nearly eight percent involved physical assaults, businesses barring Asian Americans from entering their establishments due to misplaced coronavirus fears, and attackers coughing and spitting on victims, according to STOP AAPI Hate, an anti-Asian hate tracker.
In one incident in March, a group of African American teenagers on a commuter rail in San Francisco used their backpacks to attack a mask-wearing Asian American, saying he had COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
In another occurrence in April, a stranger threw a large rock through the atrium window of a Chinese American family's house in Santa Rosa, California. The house had Chinese writing along the front door as a blessing for good health and harmony.
""These are first-hand accounts where individuals are describing harrowing and traumatizing experiences, including what is being said to them when they're being attacked,"" said Cynthia Choi, co-executive director of Chinese for Affirmative Action, one of the coalition partners.
Asian Americans have been targeted before during public health crises, as was the case during the 2003 SARS epidemic. The latest wave of anti-Asian hate comes at a time of heightened tensions over the pandemic fueled by the anti-China rhetoric of President Donald Trump and other politicians. Trump, who initially praised China for its handling of the crisis, subsequently blamed China's leader Xi Jinping for waiting weeks to report the outbreak in Wuhan to the World Health Organization and covering up the severity of the problem.
Trump has repeatedly referred to the coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus"" and ""kung-flu,"" terms that Asian American advocates say are derogatory and have exacerbated the scapegoating of Americans of Asian descent.
Trump disputes that those and other terms are racist. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, who several weeks ago criticized the phrase kung-flu as ""highly offensive,"" and press secretary Kayleigh McEnany both said this week that the president used the term merely to highlight that the virus originated in China.
But Asian American leaders say the meaning is not lost on their fast-growing community.
""Those are terms meant to be humiliating,"" said Gene Wu, a Chinese American Democratic member of the Texas House of Representatives.
Bill Tung, a Democratic state assemblyman in California, said the rhetoric has had a direct impact on the surge in anti-Asian harassment and hate crimes.
""You see leaders express words that really give license to other people to express those same sentiments and also to act on them,"" Tung said.
In a recent report examining the link between political rhetoric and anti-Asian bias, STOP AAPI Hate, the Asian American coalition, found that reports of anti-Asian discrimination spiked after Trump repeatedly used the term ""Chinese virus.""
While the vast majority of the 2,100-plus incidents recorded by STOP AAPI Hate do not rise to the level of a hate crime as defined by statute, more than 100 do, according to legal experts.
This surge in anti-Asian hate crime comes at a time when most American cities are reporting an overall decline in other categories of bias attacks, according to Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at the California State University.
The FBI defines a hate crime as a criminal offense motivated by bias against the victim's race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity
California, home to the nation's largest Asian American population, has been particularly hard hit. In Los Angeles, police recorded 30 anti-Asian hate crimes through April 30, compared to a total of four for all of 2019, according to police data compiled by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism.
In San Francisco, there were five anti-Asian hate crimes through March 31, compared to six for all of last year, according to police data.
Other major cities have reported far fewer cases of anti-Asian hate crimes. In New York City, police recorded just two incidents through May 17, compared with three for last year. In April, an Asian American woman in Brooklyn, New York, suffered second degree burns after a man poured acid on her.
One of the most horrific anti-Asian hate crimes came in March when a teenager stabbed an Asian American man and his two young children at a supermarket in Midland, Texas. The suspect reportedly carried out the attack ""because he thought the family was Chinese and infecting people with the coronavirus.""
""In the cities where anti-Asian hate crimes increased, they increased significantly to the extent that there were almost as much anti-Asian hate crime as we had for all of last year or significantly more,"" Levin said.
The surge in the crimes has not been limited to the U.S. From Melbourne, Australia, to Vancouver, Canada, Asian American communities have reported a surge in discrimination, harassment and assault.
In Vancouver, billed as the ""most Asian city outside Asia,"" there were 20 anti-Asian hate crimes through April 29, up from 12 for all of last year. London, another major city with a large Asian population, had 267 anti-Asian attacks, compared with 375 for all of last year.
""This is a global pandemic of hate,"" said Helen Zia, a prominent Chinese American civil rights activist and author."

(AP) — A New York couple is charged with assaulting a 59-year-old hotel worker in Connecticut, in what police say was a hate crime.
Philip Sarner and Emily Orbay, who have no permanent addresses but are known to be primarily from Nassau County, New York, were taken into custody Monday in Brooklyn, New York, and returned to Connecticut.
Sarner and Orbay are accused of attacking Crystal Caldwell, a 59-year-old Black desk clerk at a Quality Inn in Mystic, on June 26 after complaining about a lack of hot water in their room.
The couple, who are white, called Caldwell a monkey and punched her in the face, according to arrest warrants.
After being separated by other hotel employees, Caldwell told police she went to put ice on her injured face and was attacked again, knocked to the ground and kicked in the ribs.
All three people were taken to a local hospital for treatment of injuries, where police said they were unable to stay and monitor the couple because of visitation policies related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Sarner and Orbay later returned to the hotel, retrieved their car and left the state before they could be arrested.
Sarner is charged with second-degree assault, third-degree assault and intimidation based on bigotry and bias. Orbay is charged with third-degree assault and intimidation based on bigotry and bias. Both were released after posting bonds of $75,000 for Sarner and $50,000 for Orbay.

The report also shows that hate-motivated murders, largely committed by white supremacists, spiked to their highest number in 28 years.
The FBI's annual reports on hate crime statistics show that hate crimes have increased from 6,121 incidents in 2016 to 7,314 in 2019, a 19.49 percent increase.
Hate-motivated murders spiked to a total of 51 in 2019, the highest number in nearly 3 decades, according to an analysis of the FBI's data conducted by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism (CSHE) at California State University. The next-highest number of hate-motivated murders occurred in 2018 with 24 murders. The third-highest number occurred in 1993 and 1995, with 20 murders happening each of those years.
The 2019 tally of total hate crimes represents the highest level reported by the FBI in almost a decade. The second-highest annual total of hate crime incidents in the last decade occurred in 2010 with 7,699 incidents.
Of 2019's hate crimes, 57.6 percent were motivated by race, ethnicity or ancestry; 20.1 percent were motivated by religion; 16.7 percent were motivated by sexual orientation; 2.7 percent by gender identity; 2 percent by disability and 0.9 percent by gender.
These percentages all fall within 2 percent points of previous totals reported by the FBI over the last four years.
A majority of the hate crime incidents occurred in California, New York, Washington, New Jersey and Texas.
The greatest increases happened amongst Black people, Jewish people, gay men and Latinos. While a majority of the crimes involved assault or destruction or vandalism of property, the next most reported type of hate-motivated crimes were theft and robbery.
The CSHE found that 39 of the 51 hate-motivated murder victims in 2019 were killed by white supremacists, including the 23 victims killed in the August 3, 2019 mass shooting in El Paso, Texas. Murders committed by white supremacists have gradually increased under Trump, from 3 in 2016 to 12 in 2017 and then 17 in 2018.
Generally speaking, hate crimes fell during the administration of former-President Barack Obama, from 7,783 incidents in 2008 to 6,121 by the end of his presidency in 2016, a difference of over 21 percent.
The FBI's latest report on hate crimes was compiled using data from 15,588 law enforcement agencies detailing each hate crime's incident, victims, offenders and location. In total, the agencies reported 7,314 criminal incidents and 8,559 related offenses motivated by bias against someone's race, ethnicity, ancestry, religion, sexual orientation, disability, gender and gender identity.
Nikki Singh—a spokesperson with human rights organization, the Sikh Coalition—told Voice of America that the FBI's figures likely lower than the actual number of hate-motivated incidents as targeted communities may avoid reporting incidents to legal authorities for fear of continued discrimination.

Prominent Asian Americans say COVID-19-related atttacks have risen at an alarming rate
A group of prominent Asian Americans say prejudice, racism and physical attacks against their community have increased at alarming rates over wrongful claims that Chinese people are responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Whenever there is a contentious relationship with any part of Asia from the United States, the racism inside the United States goes up against Asians. We are at such a moment, in my belief,"" said Jerry Yang, co-founder and former CEO of Yahoo.
Yang made his remarks at a virtual event organized by the National Committee on United States-China Relations on Wednesday. He was joined by three other speakers: Anla Cheng, founder and CEO of SupChina; Erika Lee, a professor of American history and director of the Immigration History Research Center at the University of Minnesota; and Nancy Yao Maasbach, president of the Museum of Chinese in America.
At the beginning of the novel coronavirus pandemic in the US, between March and June, there were 2,100 anti-Asian American hate crimes related to COVID-19, according to Chinese advocacy groups. Some assaults were verbal, while at least 10 percent were physical.
In New York, an 89-year-old Chinese American woman was set on fire by two men in Brooklyn. The elderly woman, who spoke Cantonese, had just left her home in Bensonhurst on July 14 when the men slapped her in the face and set her clothes on fire. She was able to rub her back against a wall to put out the flames but still suffered burns.
Said Maasbach: ""The pain I felt for that 89-year-old woman … I am angry. But we need to use and channel that anger into better educating others. We need to own our identity the way we should.""
In another hate crime, a 16-year old Asian American boy was attacked at school in California's San Fernando Valley after being accused of having the coronavirus. He suffered a concussion and was rushed to the hospital.
Said Lee: ""What's happening (to Asians) today, of course, has long historical roots. It is certainly, as Jerry mentioned, in relationship to what is happening on a global scale in terms of the rising tension between the US and China, but also the pandemic has revived long-standing racist anti-immigration narratives.
""It's part of the United States' long history of xenophobia and the irrational fear and hatred of immigrants, and, in particular, disease epidemics have always played a really important role in shaping racism in leading to hate crimes.""
New York has seen several hate crimes against Chinese, prompting Attorney General Letitia James to launch a hotline where victims can report coronavirus-related incidents. California Governor Gavin Newsom also said he had seen a ""huge increase"" in assaults against Asian Americans in his state.
In a bid to document the crimes, the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council launched a website called Stop AAPI Hate where people can report assaults.
""I want to point out how prevalent assaults are (against Chinese) in the New York area,"" said Cheng. ""It even happened to my assistant, who is Malaysian Chinese, and her partner, who were both thrown to the ground.
""Her revenge was that she got to be on the front page of the New York Post, and they did catch the assailant two months later. Another thing that I was shocked to see was that in Rockville, Maryland, most gun buyers in March were Chinese Americans — this is how afraid Americans are.""
President Donald Trump and his allies have repeatedly been criticized for branding the coronavirus ""the Chinese virus"".
As of Thursday, the US had 4.8 million confirmed coronavirus cases and more than 159,000 deaths, according to data from John Hopkins University.
All of the panelists agreed that it was important for Asians to support each other and other ethnic groups facing racial abuse, particularly in the wake of nationwide protests over the May 25 death of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, who died when one of the four Minneapolis police officers at the scene knelt on his neck.
Yang added: ""When you are afraid to walk out of your house or to go somewhere because you are Asian — and by the way this is what African Americans have felt for generations — then … we need solidarity. This could be Asian Americans' wake-up call to build solidarity around race. … There may need to be a shift.""

The woman accused of throwing a glass bottle at a jogger while she was running and shouting racial abuse at her, telling her to 'go back to Africa', has appeared in court. 
Lorena Delaguna, 53, was arrested on Monday on hate crime and harassment charges after she was filmed launching an unprovoked attack on Tiffany Johnson, 37. She now faces seven years in prison if convicted. 
Officers detained her at her home and charged her with attempted assault and aggravated assault as a hate crime. 
She was taken to Queens Central Booking for arraignment and appeared in court Tuesday. Delaguna has a long rap sheet, including for burglary, menacing and graffiti, dating back to 2014, The New York Daily News reports. 
Johnson was on a run at 53rd Place and Broadway in Woodside, Queens around noon on August 17 when she passed a corner and Delaguna threw a glass bottle at her feet, police said.
She shouted: 'Get out of here n*****, go back to Africa,' according to video release by the NYPD on Wednesday. 
'It's a hate crime. It's not acceptable. She has to be [held] responsible for her behavior,' Johnson had previously told the New York Post. 
Johnson revealed she thought Delaguna had mistaken her for someone else, and didn't initially think the attack was racially motivated. 
But once the woman started to scream hateful insults at her, she realized it was because she is black. 
'She could see the color of my skin and she reacted to that,' Johnson said.
'I was definitely shocked. I was surprised but more importantly I wanted to get away from her,' she added.
In the clip Johnson is seen turning back confused and saying 'What is your problem?' when the woman berates her and then continues her run.
'I'm entitled to go for a job, live my life, enjoy my life and enjoy the things that makes me happy,' she said.
Johnson said she took the route of being the bigger person and leaving rather than arguing with the woman.
'That's not on me. That's a reflection on her. She needs to look at herself and figure out why she looks down on somebody,' she said.
'We are always trying to give reasons for what people do but I can't get into her head. I only know what she did, what she said and her actions,' she added.
Johnson previously revealed she was happy police were on the hunt for her attacker. She did not report the incident at the time until a friend saw the witness video on social media. 
She told ABC7 she has not gone back to that neighborhood since the incident, but has received an outpouring of support from groups like Black Girls Run. "
134,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1/Files (250).DOCX","The New York Times",2020-10-22,"1583 words","NYREGION","John Leland",NA,"He Was a Rising Jazz Pianist. Then His N.Y.C. Dreams Were Shattered.",FALSE,"The police said an attack on the pianist was not a hate crime, but social media disagreed. Now he’s considering a return to Japan.
He came to New York from Tokyo to make it as a jazz musician, and he did, landing gigs in several touring bands and leading a trio of his own. He was elegant but never flashy on the piano, always well prepared and on time.
It was not an easy path. On Sept. 27, at around 7:20 in the evening, that path got a lot harder.
Coming off the subway at West 135th Street after a video shoot, Tadataka Unno, 40, a new father, encountered a group of about eight young people who blocked his way to the turnstiles. When he tried to pass through, one of them shoved him from behind. Another said he had pushed her, and a young man near her said, “My girl is pregnant.”
That’s when the beating started — first in the subway station and then up on the street, where he yelled for people to help him, to no avail.
“I thought that this was how I was going to die,” he recalled two weeks later, describing the attack in a written note because it was still painful to talk about it. He did not know how many in the group had hit him. They fractured his right collarbone, injured his arm and bruised him all over. After surgery for the broken bones, he was not sure whether he will ever be able to play the piano again. He has been unable to use his right hand at all, and said he is learning to do everything with his left hand.
The police have made no arrests, though Mr. Unno said the assault was captured on camera in the subway station. He remembered at least one of the attackers calling him “Asian” and “Chinese,” along with a profanity.
‘I needed to know the culture.’
How quickly does a life change course?
Tadataka Unno was fated to arrive in New York. He started playing jazz piano at age 9, and playing professionally in Japan at 18. The work was steady and gratifying, with recording opportunities and gigs almost every night. But, after a decade, he felt there was something missing, he said in a telephone interview. He could listen to records in Japan, but jazz was more than recordings. “I needed to know the culture,” he said.
In 2008, when he was 27, his mother cried when he said he was moving to New York, told him not to go. She thought New York was dangerous.
“I wanted to meet my heroes, to play with them, to talk, to hang out,” he said. “If I stay in Japan it’ll never happen.”
He and his wife, Sayaka, arrived in Harlem on June 19, 2008. Harlem was where jazz history lived. “I didn’t know anybody,” he said. “I didn’t have any job. But I didn’t worry about it. I was just happy to be in New York.”
New York breaks those dreams more often than not. But Mr. Unno made them work.
“He’s one of the workman jazz piano players on the New York scene,” said Spike Wilner, a pianist who owns and runs Smalls and Mezzrow, two clubs downtown. “He works hard, practices hard, but he’s not necessarily high profile. But he’s a tasty pianist, elegant. And a sweetheart of a guy, very gentle. He calls me Spike-san, and I call him Tada-san. Everybody loves him.”
He got work playing with Jimmy Cobb, who played drums on Miles Davis’s album “Kind of Blue,” which is like being second from the end at Mount Rushmore. This led to a two-year stint with the trumpeter Roy Hargrove, a phenom closer to Mr. Unno’s generation.
“That was a historical moment, because Roy never hired an Asian guy before me,” Mr. Unno said with obvious pride. Mr. Hargrove died of cardiac arrest brought on by kidney disease two years ago, at age 49. Mr. Unno was his last regular pianist. “He gave me so much love and culture, history,” Mr. Unno said. “I feel I have a responsibility for what I learned from him. I need to make it my own way, through my music.”
Mr. Unno was always keenly aware of the racial dynamic of jazz, that he was working in a music genre developed by African-Americans, said his friend Jerome Jennings, a drummer and jazz educator who met him back in Japan.
“He was always asking questions to get a better understanding of the culture,” Mr. Jennings said. “There’s a song lyric, ‘You can keep your Dixie/Drop me off in Harlem.’ Tada asked me, ‘What does Dixie mean?’ He was totally open to ingesting the culture and understanding it by any means. He just soaked it up. Living in Harlem was part of that. He understood it was where all those great musicians lived. He knew the importance.”
By 2020, most of what he had envisioned when he left Tokyo for New York had come his way. He had peers, recognition and music. In June he and his wife had their first child, a son.
“He was so happy,” Mr. Wilner said. “Of course, it puts a lot of pressure on him to keep working, keep things coming in. But he’s very excited.”
The racial epithet
As the attack went on, Mr. Unno said he was saved by a woman who called for an ambulance, which took him to Harlem Hospital Center. He was in shock from the beating and from the unwillingness of bystanders to step in. Nothing like this had ever happened to him before. He could not move his arm, and would have to return for surgery. At home, he said, he felt like his wife had “two babies to take care of.”
On Oct. 3, Mr. Jennings created a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for medical bills and other expenses. Since the start of the pandemic in March, Mr. Unno, like other musicians, had been unable to earn money by performing. Now his downtime was indefinite, with a baby at home and bills piling up.
The GoFundMe campaign, which made no mention of any racial remarks made by the attackers, surpassed its modest goal of $25,000 on the first day. The money kept coming in, with posts on social media spreading the word and wishing Mr. Unno a full recovery.
Then on Oct. 6, the Japanese news outlet Asahi Shimbun quoted Mr. Unno saying that one of the attackers had used the word “Chinese” during the attack. Other outlets in Asia and the United States picked up the story, emphasizing the slur. “Japanese Musician Beaten Up in New York for Being ‘Chinese,’” ran the headline in Japan Today. Many noted that crimes against Asian-Americans have risen since the start of the pandemic, which Donald Trump has repeatedly blamed on China.
The tenor of social media posts changed. Now it was a story about racism, about “white thugs” inspired by Mr. Trump in one post, or, in a Twitter post soon after, about “racist blacks in Harlem” who “get away with racial slurs and violence.”
As a window on racial violence rather than a random assault, social media posts spread beyond jazz circles. Grace Meng, a congresswoman representing part of Queens, wrote that “Hate — against AAPIs and against any community — has no place in New York,” using the abbreviation for Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders. Any uncertainty about the attackers’ motives seemed to evaporate.
Mr. Unno received an outpouring of messages from Japanese Americans who recounted their own experiences with racism. He was astonished by their number. As he read the messages, he said, “My pain was their pain.”
But the motives behind a seemingly senseless crime can be hard to know with certainty.
The police have found no indication that the group attacked Mr. Unno because of his race, and have not classified the attack as a bias crime. Mr. Unno said the attack was a “blur,” but that he was sure he had heard the slur. There was no evidence that Mr. Trump’s influence had a role in the attack.
An officer from the police department’s Asian Hate Crime Task Force, which formed in August because of the rise in violence, interviewed Mr. Unno but did not consider the attack to be motivated by race.
Mr. Jennings cautioned against calling it a hate crime without more evidence. The attackers, he said, were young people in a time of heightened stress and anger. “I think some of the papers are spinning a bit,” he said.
The GoFundMe campaign recently passed $165,000.
Mr. Unno said he still needed “very strong painkillers” to get through the day. He is unable to play piano or hold his son, and does not know how much function he will regain. Even as he worries about his physical recovery, he fears that recovering from the emotional trauma may be even more difficult. Since the attack he has not left the apartment except for medical treatments because he is afraid. He does not think he could recognize the attackers, because he lost his glasses with the first blows.
Until the attack, he had never experienced racism in New York, he said, and it shook him. He had come to the city to mix with people not like him, and now he was suffering for this difference.
He said he was considering leaving the city that once drew him like the sun, possibly returning to Japan. “My wife and I worry about raising kids here, especially after this happened,” he said.
The messages from other Asian-Americans talking about their own ordeals, he said, brought home that “there isn’t a major movement like Black Lives Matter that creates a space for Asians to talk about these issues.”
That needed to change, he said. “The Asian community is not so tight. Asian people need to stand up and take action.”

To the Editor: 
 Re ''Hate Crimes at Highest Since 2008, F.B.I. Reports'' (news article, Nov. 17):
 For nearly three decades, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's reporting on hate crimes statistics has consistently provided the most comprehensive snapshot available of bias-motivated criminal activity in the United States. Still, it remains clear that the agency's yearly statistics understate the true number of hate crimes committed in our country.
 Underreporting is attributable to numerous factors, including a lack of political leadership, inadequate training and a failure by some agencies to prioritize tracking and to comprehensively identify and record hate crimes.
 It is hard to fix a problem without quantifiable data. At a time of rising hate in the United States, Congress must act swiftly on the Khalid Jabara and Heather Heyer National Opposition to Hate, Assault and Threats to Equality Act of 2019 (''No Hate'' Act), a bill named for two recent victims of hate crimes.
 The legislation would significantly enhance the accuracy of the F.B.I. statistics by authorizing new funding and support for state and local governments to encourage more robust reporting. With the best data in hand we can work to identify and counter the sources of hate crimes and provide better assistance to victims.

 Plea to the Media: Ignore Trump After Jan. 20
 To the Editor:
 Now that the presidential election is a victory for the Democrats, my thoughts shift to how the press will handle Donald Trump, ex-president. As an exhausted citizen, I implore you not to give any oxygen to the headline-baiting roars of a wounded, irrelevant politician. There will be no polite retreat from Mr. Trump, no chance for Joe Biden to begin his presidency in peace, should the media continue to chase Mr. Trump's every dishonest, outrageous utterance.
 I hold the press somewhat accountable for its wall-to-wall coverage of this bright, shiny charlatan five years ago. Now that his presidency seems to be finished, please leave him alone after Jan. 20. This is his very worst fear.

Crucial Quote
 It saddens us to no end to learn of the assault on our band mate ... and his friend, The Mavericks singer Raul Malo said in astatementTuesday on behalf of the band. For this assault to occur as we celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month with our own performance (featuring Lorenzo) tonight on the Hispanic Heritage Awards, shows that although we ve come a long way, we still have a long way to go. America is better than this. 
Key Background
The Mavericks won aGrammy awardfor Best Country Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocal in 1995 for a performance of their song,Here Comes The Rain. They have been nominated eight other times, as recently as 2017. The reported number of hate crimes in the United States has increased, especially against Latinos. In 2018, reported hate crimes were at their highest in16 years, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The year marked the most reported hate crimes against Latinos since 2010. Some critics blamed Trump and his rhetoric that railed against immigration from Central and South America. When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best, Trump said in 2015, when heannounced his candidacyfor president in New York. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people. "

The New York State Senate passed a bill sponsored by Senator Todd Kaminsky that will make it mandatory for students to learn about symbols of hate, such as the swastika and noose – labelling them as “symbols of bigotry.”
The legislation will mandate that New York middle and high schools include such education in their curriculums. If signed into law, it would be the first bill in the United States to require schools to educate their students on symbols of hate.
“With incidents of racism and antisemitism rearing their ugly head across our nation, it is essential that we tackle the root causes of bigotry and hate that have infected our society,” said Senator Todd Kaminsky. “By educating our children about the vile meanings of the swastika and noose, we can take tangible steps to stamp out racism and antisemitism from our society. I urge the Assembly to pass this vital piece of legislation and send a clear message that hate has no place in New York and our nation at-large.”
Kaminsky spearheaded the bill after Nassau County District Attorney Madeline Singas noted that many youths arrested for “hate graffiti” have no knowledge of the meaning behind the symbols they illustrate.
“The noise and swastika are symbols of hate that have been used to threaten and intimidate, and as we work to address injustice in our communities, educating children about the meaning and history of these hate symbols is an important step,” said Nassau County District Attorney Madeline Singas. “I thank Senator Kaminsky and Assemblyman Lavine for their leadership and commitment to this important legislation.”
“We all recognise that there is much work to do to eliminate racism and antisemitism from our society. By ensuring students across New York are taught the hateful underpinnings of the noose as a symbol of racism as well as the swastika as the emblem of the Nazis, we are taking a significant step toward our ultimate goal. I applaud Senator Kaminsky’s work on this vital piece of legislation and look forward to seeing it enacted into law,” said NAACP Long Island Regional Director Tracey Edwards.
“In the last few years, hate crimes have been on the rise on Long Island, in New York State, and our Nation. While there needs to be various means used in combating this hate, one of the key components must be educating our youth,” said Executive Director of JCRC-LI Mindy Perlmutter. “Thus, Jewish Community Relations Council of Long Island is proud to support Senator Todd Kaminsky’s bill requiring New York school children in grades 6 through 12 to be educated regarding symbols of hate, including the swastika and the noose.

Today, co-chairs of the Jewish Latino Congressional Caucus, Reps. Adriano Espaillat (NY-13), Eliot Engel (NY-16), Debbie Wasserman Schultz (FL-23), Will Hurd (TX-23), and Mario Diaz Balart (FL-25) released the following statement in support of the No Hate Act:
Key excerpts from the joint statement:
""Hate crimes do not just affect victims. Because the victim is targeted solely because of his or her race, religion, gender, or ethnicity, when an attack occurs, entire communities are put on notice. The most recent FBI report on hate crimes shows an 11.7% rise last year in the number of violent hate crimes. The number of victims in anti-Latino or Hispanic hate crimes rose over 21% in 2018. Jews were the target of a stunning 57.8 percent of all religious bias crimes in 2018, despite making up less than 2 percent of the U.S. population,"" said the members.
""The coronavirus pandemic has brought out both the best and worst of our society. First responders, healthcare professionals, and so many frontline essential workers have indeed shown bravery in the face of fear. They have saved lives and ensured that we all have access to food, pharmaceuticals, and other necessities. Human solidarity has been on display as we face this unprecedented challenge together. However, as uncertainty rises, we have seen hatred unleashed. Conspiracy theories about the role of Jews in creating or spreading the virus swarm. Misinformation abounds.
""For this reason, we affirm our support for H.R.3545, the National Opposition to Hate, Assaults, and Threats to Equality (NO HATE) Act. The bipartisan bill will improve hate crime reporting through law enforcement training, allow for the creation of reporting hotlines, call for the increase in resources to liaise with affected communities, and promote public educational forums on hate crimes,"" the members concluded.

As co-chairs of the Jewish Latino Congressional Caucus, we affirm the following:
Hate crimes do not just affect victims. Because the victim is targeted solely because of his or her race, religion, gender, or ethnicity, when an attack occurs, entire communities are put on notice. The most recent FBI report on hate crimes shows an 11.7% rise last year in the number of violent hate crimes. The number of victims in anti-Latino or Hispanic hate crimes rose over 21% in 2018. Jews were the target of a stunning 57.8 percent of all religious bias crimes in 2018, despite making up less than 2 percent of the U.S. population.
The coronavirus pandemic has brought out both the best and worst of our society. First responders, healthcare professionals, and so many frontline essential workers have indeed shown bravery in the face of fear. They have saved lives and ensured that we all have access to food, pharmaceuticals, and other necessities. Human solidarity has been on display as we face this unprecedented challenge together
However, as uncertainty rises, we have seen hatred unleashed. Conspiracy theories about the role of Jews in creating or spreading the virus swarm. Misinformation abounds. For this reason, we affirm our support for H.R.3545, the National Opposition to Hate, Assaults, and Threats to Equality (NO HATE) Act. The bipartisan bill will improve hate crime reporting through law enforcement training, allow for the creation of reporting hotlines, call for the increase in resources to liaise with affected communities, and promote public educational forums on hate crimes.
In 1990, Congress passed the Hate Crimes Statistics Act, which requires the Attorney General to collect data on crimes committed due to the victim's ""race, gender and gender identity, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or ethnicity."" For more than two decades, thousands of city, county, college and university, state, tribal, and Federal law enforcement agencies have voluntarily submitted hate crimes data to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr., Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 is the first statute allowing Federal authorities to understand, investigate, and prosecute hate crimes committed on the basis of actual or perceived ""race, color, religion, national origin, gender or gender identity, sexual orientation, or disability."" However, due to inaccurate and incomplete hate crime reporting, we lack a complete understanding of the national problem posed by hate crimes.
In the latest FBI report, more than 85 cities of over 100,000 residents reported zero incidents or did not report hate crimes to the agency. Syracuse, NY; Midland, TX; Hialeah, FL, are among the cities on this list. Managed through the Department of Justice (DOJ), this bill will issue grants to empower State and local governments to improve hate crimes reporting. These funds come from existing allocations and will not create new financial responsibilities for the federal government. In exchange for receiving grants, State and local governments must provide additional information pertaining to hate crimes in their jurisdiction. If they fail to do so, they must repay the grants in full. It also amends the penalties for hate crimes to allow courts to require that offenders engage in education about, or service to, the affected communities as a condition of their release from prison.
We hope that our colleagues on both sides of the aisle and in both chambers will ensure that this bill is passed and signed into law."

I will talk to John Bolton on ""The Story"" at 7:00 p.m. We'll see you then. Good night, everybody.
TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Over the weekend, as you likely know, officials in New York announced that they are tearing down a bronze statue of Teddy Roosevelt. That statue has stood on Central Park for 80 years. Antifa demanded its removal, so Mayor Bill de Blasio complied and he is taking it down.
Few people ever could have imagined that Teddy Roosevelt would be canceled. Roosevelt was the most popular President in American history. He was also a war hero, a historian, a naturalist, a rancher, a Chief of Police, an author, conservationist, as well as the father of six.
At one point in Roosevelt's extraordinarily busy life, he was also the Governor of New York. This morning, the current Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo weighed in on his removal.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): People are making a statement about equality, about community, to be against racism, against slavery. I think those are good statements. And it depends, you know, can you overdo it? Of course you can.
But in New York, I don't think we've overdone it. And I think that -- I think it's a healthy expression of people saying, let's get some priorities here and let's remember the sin and mistake that these this nation made, and let's not celebrate it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: Were you listening carefully to that? In the State of New York, the Governor tells us, we haven't overdone it. Destroying public property is quote, ""a healthy expression of people saying, let's get some priorities here.""
Okay, so that's the standard set forth by a Democratic Party leader. Let's think it through for a minute.
Andrew Cuomo lives in the Governor's Mansion in Albany. Teddy Roosevelt once lived there, too. So did Governors Grover Cleveland and Franklin Roosevelt. By current standards, both Cleveland and FDR were racists.
Cleveland extended the Chinese Exclusion Act; FDR, of course, interned Japanese-Americans by the tens of thousands during World War II. Therefore, like the statues now lying smashed on the ground in parks across the country, the Governor's Mansion in Albany, New York is suffused with the spirit of white supremacy.
Its very existence as an object is an act of violence against marginalized people. It cannot stand. Should the mob burn it down? Would torching the racist Governor's Mansion amount to a quote, ""healthy expression of people saying let's get some priorities here."" What do you think? Are you crazy? Of course not.
Andrew Cuomo lives in the Governor's Mansion. You get within 20 feet of that building and you'll have one of his goon shoot you to death. Andrew Cuomo is all for destroying things, just not his own things. And by the way, hands off New York's a little latest monument, the Mario Cuomo Bridge, formerly the Tappan Zee, which Andrew named after his father. That's off limits, too.
Okay, so what exactly is, quote, ""a healthy expression of moral priorities"" in a moment like this? Keep in mind, this is a big country and not everyone has the same priorities. It may be hard to believe if you consume a steady diet of popular media, but not every single person in America is an upper middle class white kid from Brooklyn, with the predictable political views to match. There's actual diversity of views out there.
For example, there are quite a few Muslim-Americans in this country and many of them don't love Mahatma Gandhi. They consider Gandhi a Hindu nationalist. Yet at the same time, there are dozens of statues of Mahatma Gandhi in the United States. One of them in fact stands right across the road from the Vice President's House on Massachusetts Avenue in Washington.
Are angry mobs allowed to rip them down? Would Governor Andrew Cuomo consider that a healthy expression of priorities? Worth asking -- or what if you didn't like Martin Luther King? Most people do like Martin Luther King, but most people also like Teddy Roosevelt and George Washington. So clearly, popularity has no bearing on whether your statue is allowed to stand in this country.
So can you spray paint obscenities on Martin Luther King's monuments if you don't like him? How healthy would that be? These are theoretical questions. Obviously, you know the answer to them because you know the rules. The rules are never spoken out loud, but they are obvious.
America has two standards of justice. When they do it to you, it is social justice. If you dare to defend yourself, it's a hate crime.
Consider what we've seen recently. How many stores and parks and statues and public buildings have been destroyed recently by rioters? How many churches and memorials and monuments to our fallen soldiers have been desecrated by them? Too many to count.
Now ask yourself, how many people have been held accountable for these crimes? Some? A few? No, hardly any.
Politicians applauded this destruction. Law enforcement has ignored it. Why is that exactly? Rioting is a Federal crime; so is arson. So far, two people have been arrested and charged in the burning of the Third Police Precinct in Minneapolis, two. Video footage, which is everywhere -- you've seen -- it shows clearly that scores of people were involved. Authorities could identify them and charge all of them. We might have fewer riots if they did that. But no, the Justice Department isn't interested in doing that.
What are they interested in?
Well, let's see. Recently, a NASCAR driver called Bubba Wallace claimed that someone left a noose in his garage in Alabama. The media reacted as if a war had broken out, wall to wall coverage. They made it precisely clear who the enemy was. And of course, countless syrupy segments on the dopey morning shows framing the whole thing as a milestone in the march toward Civil Rights.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: These scenes of unity coming just 24 hours after a noose was found in Wallace's team garage stall, an area restricted to only essential personnel. NASCAR and the FBI are now investigating.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: These scenes with unity. Unfortunately, no one covering this story ever bothered to ask the obvious questions, where exactly was this noose? The actual noose Bubba Wallace kept talking about. No picture of it ever surfaced. And by the way, haven't we heard this story somewhere before? Like repeatedly?
Between 2015 and 2018, there were six high profile so-called hate crimes involving nooses. All of them are promoted heavily by the media. Every one of them turned out to be a hoax, every single one of them and that's not even counting Jussie Smollett.
The odds that this news hate crime was real, were always very small. It's just not a very racist country actually, in the end. Most of us know that.
But you'd never know it from listening to the authorities. The U.S. Attorney suggested Federal charges would be brought -- brought against whom? That was never clear.
Meanwhile, the FBI swooped in by the vanload. The Bureau sent at least 15 agents to investigate this provocation against a millionaire racecar driver -- 15 agents -- at a time when mobs were roaming the country completely unchallenged by law enforcement, burning things, assaulting people.
In the end, as you may have heard, it was needless to say, yet another news hoax. There was no hate crime in Bubba Wallace's garage. We'll have details on that story later in the show.
But for now, what does it tell you that the FBI and Federal prosecutors fell for this hoax so completely? Well, it tells you everything.
At the very moment Bubba Wallace was doing his star turn as America's latest victim of injustice, lecturing his fans about the racism, being backed up completely by the morons who run NASCAR, a mob of violent lunatics was ripping down a statue of American patriot, Francis Scott Key in San Francisco.
On Key's empty pedestal, they spray painted these words which effectively are their slogan, quote, ""Kill the colonizers. Kill whitey."" In other words, murder Americans for the color of their skin.
Now, you can argue about whether hate crimes ought to exist as a category in American law, and that's an argument worth having. But as long as they do exist, that would seem to qualify as one and that the FBI did not swoop in with 15 agents to investigate. It's not clear if anyone ever investigated because no one in power cared.
If anything, they agreed.
And that's the point. The mob does not operate independently from the Democratic establishment. The mob is an arm of the Democratic establishment.
In the City of Philadelphia, both the Mayor and the District Attorney, Larry Krasner, we've told you about repeatedly -- cheered as mobs set fire and destroyed public property there.
But when a group of working class Philadelphians tried to protect the statue of Christopher Columbus from being destroyed, Krasner threatened to prosecute them. You'd think the mob will ever show up at Larry Krasner's house? Not likely. In fact, No, never. And by the way, Nancy Pelosi is also safe at her estate in Napa.
Democratic politicians don't fear the mob. Notice that. Why? Because they don't need to. They control the mob. The mob operates with their permission. These are their foot soldiers. This is their militia.
In unguarded moments, Democrats make it very clear that they know this. Here's a revealing video shot just today. In it, you'll see Eleanor Holmes Norton. She is the non-voting Democratic delegate from D.C. to the Congress. You'll see her being interviewed by a well-known MSNBC anchor near the White House.
Out of nowhere, a man dressed in women's underwear charges at them because that's the kind of moment we're living in right now. And for a second, they were frightened. Watch what they said.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Where are the police when you need them?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: Where are the police when you need them? It was their first reaction. At the moment they said that, the two were standing on a street with a mural that demands we defund the police. Of course, they missed the irony of that completely. It never occurred to them that the slogan might apply to them too, because they know it doesn't apply to them. They know they will always have police protection.
And the thing is, they're right. They will. Federal law enforcement is entirely on their side. That's why there have been so few prosecutions of rioting and so much FBI attention to Bubba Wallace's fake hate crime.
Career bureaucrats in the Federal agencies support the Democratic Party. That means they support the mob as well. It's their militia, too.
Virtually every American power center now stands on one side of the political divide. What you're watching in the streets is an attempt to crush the holdouts. Ask yourself, who is being targeted for destruction right now? Anyone who is not on board with their program. That includes local police departments, Orthodox Jews, gun owners, Fox News, NASCAR fans, traditional Christianity.
That's not a random assortment of institutions. It's the people standing in their way. There's a reason that Black Lives Matter leader, Shaun King, yesterday called for the desecration of churches. That will bring those Christians to heel.
None of this should surprise us. We should have seen it coming. It was obvious. We've known for 50 years that much of the poison in our society emanates from the universities, but we have done nothing whatsoever to fix that. We've continued to fund them no matter what they charged. We keep sending our children there.
We've known for more than three years that the Federal government's intelligence and law enforcement agencies are dangerously corrupt. They act as armed enforcers for the Democratic Party. That's why Roger Stone is going to prison. They no longer even try to hide this or their partisan affiliation.
Just today, a group of dozens of former National Security officials announced they will be campaigning for Joe Biden this fall. And yet, once again, in the face of mountains of evidence, we've done nothing about it. There has been no meaningful reform of the C.I.A. or the FBI or any of the other terrifyingly powerful agencies that operate independently from our democracy and on the side of the Democratic Party.
We know all of this, we still pretend they're legitimate. We dutifully send in our taxes every quarter to pay their salaries. If there's any good to come out of this moment, and we hope there is, it's that we can no longer lie to ourselves about what is happening.
Our institutions are not serving all of us equally. Some are actively trying to hurt us. When this is over, we need to do something about that. This time for real.
Well, first there was CHOP, now there's BHAZ. That's new independent republic in your nation's capital. Demonstrators you're trying to erect a no police zone just outside the White House. A journalist tracking the independent struggle of this new nation joins us next.
CARLSON: Well, it took the pointless murder of a 19-year-old man, but authorities in Seattle are finally claiming they may try to do something about the breakaway nation of CHOP established in their downtown. But the Chopestani cause has already inspired imitators in the Nation's Capital.
Demonstrators are trying to create their own cop free zone. They call it the Black House Autonomous Zone, BHAZ. Town Hall senior writer Julio Rosas has been tracking the rise of BHAZ and continued confrontations between leftwing extremists and the police.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I feel sorry for your family. You're a piece of [bleep]. You're a piece of [bleep]. You really are. You really are. You're part of the [bleep] problem.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: Demonstrators seem to have made essentially a career given that most of them don't have jobs out of screaming lunatic things at the police.
[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]
CARLSON: Who filmed those videos? Julio Rosas of Townhall joins us in just a moment to describe what he saw today. But first we want to bring you someone you know well, Brian Kilmeade season five of his Fox Nation series, ""What Made America Great"" debuts this Sunday.
In the episode, Kilmeade will speak with the President about attacks on our country's monuments. Here is what the President responded.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: They would knock down Lincoln. There's a group that wants to take down Lincoln. They just haven't figured out exactly why yet.
George Washington, Thomas Jefferson -- I've stopped them twice now from going over to the Jefferson Memorial. If I weren't President, they would have knocked out -- if a guy like Biden was President, they will knock down the Jefferson Memorial.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: Just hours after the interview was recorded, demonstrators did try to knock down President Jackson's statue near Lafayette Park. They were prevented from doing that.
Brian Kilmeade joins us tonight. Brian, thanks so much for coming on. Before I ask you why no one's really doing anything about all of this and no one really is. What is the point of it? What is the -- why statues? What message are they sending to the rest of us?
BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Just to show you how newsworthy this is, sometimes we look at what made America great, you look back in the past.
I was in the Oval Office doing a history of the White House wanting to get him to talk about history. He said, I'm -- he segued right over the statues. They're trying to destroy our history.
Now, I brought up Andrew Jackson because they're trying to take down a Jackson statue in New Orleans. I turned on your show and he commented on that. I turned on your show and you opened last night with just a half mile away, two hours from when I left him, they were trying to take away Andrew Jackson.
I'll tell you what, Tucker, by the time you were off the air, I thought that statue would be down. Thankfully, the police got there. And I wonder what took them so long? But they got there to stop it.
And I think in the big picture, people are trying to find fault with our past because they don't like the country. These people aren't trying to make our country better. You want to make our country better, you know what you should petition? Andrew Jackson had slaves, as great as he was, 14- year-old orphan who was jailed in the Revolutionary War. Were you fighting for the country at the age of 14?
Also, when you lost your family to the war to the British? Did you pledge allegiance to your country and become a lawyer and Attorney General, a judge, a congressman, a major general to win the most decisive, impactful battle in our history to that point, the Battle of New Orleans, and then go on to be a two-term President?
This is an American success story. If you want to make America better, you put a plaque on there and said, yes, he had slaves in his day and he was part of the Indian Removal Act, and those weren't positive things.
But there was a generation called the Jackson Generation, the Jacksonian era. That's why there's a statue. You don't want to make America better. You want to destroy our past because we don't live up to the lofty standards of the shirtless skateboarders who want to petition and protest and try to intimidate reporters on a nightly basis.
CARLSON: They have the lowest standards and not just to personal hygiene that I've ever seen in any group. They're totally ignorant. They're illiterate vandals. And our leaders, with very few exceptions have decided to let them rampage through our country. And I don't understand why. Do you?
KILMEADE: No, I don't and it makes no sense. You know, you've got guys like Tom Cotton who won't stand for it. So, he goes to the Ivy League school, serves in the infantry. He bleeds red, white and blue. And there's probably five or six in the Senate, maybe three in the House. Not one Democrat, by the way, he was the first Democratic President, stand up for him.'
Why am I standing up for him? Why is Tom Cotton standing up for your America for him?
CARLSON: Because you're Americans.
KILMEADE: Stand up for him. You mentioned FDR. Yes, but you mentioned FDR. Hey, Tucker, they never told us, the people in our Social Studies books were perfect. They told us they were important to the makeup of America.
America gets better and better and better. We never said we're perfect. What's great about us is we try to be and that's what Jackson was. Jackson was in every man -- he wasn't a founding father. He had no connections to Washington. They hated him. They told him not to go so he brought his family, he couldn't trust anyone.
When Washington rejected him, he put his case to the people. When he lost a close election, he shook the hand of John Quincy Adams and essentially said, rematch. He beat him four years later. He was the everyman President. In '81, South Carolina tried to secede. He told South Carolina, you secede him, sending in the army.
He kept our country together another 30 years. You could analyze his administration, do a paper on it, get a PhD. Don't take down his statue.
I am just so glad they made a statue as tough as the person because they couldn't get him down with chains. They couldn't get him down with ropes. They can defile them, but they couldn't take him down.
I'm not saying I want to be Andrew Jackson. I'm telling you, if I was suffering from dysentery and I had to lead an Army of ragtag Americans, Choctaw Indians, regular Marines, pirates, put them together in three weeks and beat an army that just beat Napoleon and wiped them out in 45 minutes. I think that's a pretty special American that deserves a statue, deserves a plaque, deserves your respect. That's all.
CARLSON: Amen.
KILMEADE: Be respectful of our past. Everybody wants to be us for a reason.
CARLSON: A statue made of hickory. Brian Kilmeade, great to see you tonight. Thank you so much.
Be sure to check out Brian's show, ""What Made America Great,"" this Sunday 10 p.m. Fox Nation special airing Sunday right here on the Fox News Channel.
We're going to get to Julio Rosas of Townhall now. He filmed the dramatic pictures in Lafayette Park we showed you a couple of moments ago. He was back outside the White House again today, Julio, are you there?
JULIO ROSAS, SENIOR REPORTER, TOWNHALL: Yes, I can hear you. Can hear me, Tucker?
CARLSON: Perfectly, I can. Thank you. So, tell us what you saw out there today?
ROSAS: So what we've seen or what I saw today, so the Parks Police and the D.C. Metro Police has completely pushed away, push the protesters away from the Autonomous Zone that they tried to set up earlier, yesterday. And they were quite upset about that because they had first aid stations, they had food stations, water stations, things of that nature.
But obviously, they weren't going to let the -- especially the mob -- tear down the statue of Andrew Jackson, and so that's why they pushed the perimeter out there completely.
And I just came from the Lincoln Park, which is in the Capitol Hill neighborhood and they're expressing their outrage towards the Emancipation statue, where it shows Abraham Lincoln over a kneeling slave and they are saying that they are planning on tearing down that statue in that park on Thursday.
CARLSON: So, the man who freed the slaves is now recast as a racist. I mean, it's not even worth discussing how stupid these people are. I mean, it really is an indictment of our education system, above all, but I'm interested since you were there. What were they saying?
ROSAS: One of the main speakers there, he said that that that statue of Lincoln was just a classic case of showing how black people were inferior to white people. He said that because the park is Federal property -- and so he said that that land that they were standing on was stolen land, and that actually wasn't Federal property at all.
And so they were really upset again, because of how it portrays Lincoln with the freed slave, and there was some disagreement among the crowd. There was an older woman who said, where was this outrage when the statue was being built? And they were saying that they didn't have the power back then to prevent it from being put up.
And so like I said, they're not planning on tearing down the statue today. They're planning on doing that on Thursday.
CARLSON: So, I think I know that some statues of Lincoln in this country were paid for by the donations of freed slaves, who you can imagine, and I think it's a fair assumption in large part were pro-Lincoln and for obvious reasons.
Now, again, we know these people are morons, they know nothing. They're illiterates. But did anyone say that?
ROSAS: They -- again, yes, there was some disagreement because there was a woman, a white woman who was talking about how they bring school kids, by that park to talk about emancipation. They have a little gathering on Emancipation Day, and she was shouted down by the crowd, by them saying ""Go home, Karen.""
She felt uncomfortable because she said that there was a mob and they took offense to saying that they weren't a mob. So then -- but because she was a white woman, and some of the some of the people in the crowd were black, they were saying that she was kind of coopting their protests and so they weren't too happy with her presence there.
CARLSON: ""Go home, Karen."" Okay. So when the media tolerate a racial slur, oh, it's just a meme. Then it grows. Of course, whatever you tolerate you get more of. It's like the most basic lesson. Julio, be safe. Good luck. Please come back.
ROSAS: Thanks, Tucker.
CARLSON: Coronavirus cases are rising in this country as various states open up. Should we be worried about that? What numbers really matter if you're interested in what the danger is and what numbers are misleading, no one has a tighter handle on this than Alex Berenson. He joins us next.
CARLSON: After weeks of slow decline, new cases of the coronavirus are rising once again, now more than 30,000 new cases a day. It's not surprising. The protests you're watching on television have had an effect. Our leaders aren't bothered by that. They're more interested in politics at the moment.
Right now, for example, in Lincoln County, Oregon, officials have decreed that all people must wear masks in public, but the order only applies to people who are white. Non-white citizens are exempt as long as they claim to fear, quote, ""racial profiling.""
So, where do we go from here now that coronavirus cases arising? Another lockdown on the way -- or is there more to these numbers? The first person we ask these questions always is Alex Berenson. He's the author of ""Unreported Truths About COVID-19 and Lockdowns."" He's done more than anyone to get to the truth in this, he joins us tonight.
Alex, just bottom line it for us if you would, what do these numbers mean?
ALEX BERENSON, AUTHOR: Sure. So Tucker, first of all, I would actually push back on you a little bit on this. It's not clear that the protests have played any role in the community spread because we would be seeing something more nationally. I would think if that's true.
CARLSON: Yes.
BERENSON: And instead we're seeing it in a couple of states, large Sunbelt states. So what's happening? What's happening is that Texas, Florida, Arizona, especially, which have about 60 million people combined, there is a notable rise in new positive tests, which the media generally calls cases. It's really positive tests.
And in the last week or so, there's been a notable rise, certainly in Texas and Arizona in ICU beds being filled with COVID patients and hospitalizations, so I don't want to sugarcoat that.
You know, one of the things I promised you, I promised, you know, your audience is to tell the truth.
CARLSON: Yes.
BERENSON: And the truth is, there's reason to pay attention to this. But I will also be clear, it's not clear how serious this is. It doesn't look like at this point that it's not manageable with sort of normal hospital settings like do we do we need surge capacity? Not right now. Is this a result of better testing? It may be, but it also looks like there's real community spread happening.
Is it a result possibly of testing of people in congregate settings like migrant workers in dormitories and stuff like that? It's possible, but again, there appears to be some real community spread happening and I don't mean to downplay that.
CARLSON: So, what does this mean going forward? We've heard for months about a possible resurgence in the fall. That's the course of some flu viruses. Is that still likely?
BERENSON: So that's a great question. I mean, this has been one of the first times in the last three months when cases have taken a turn that that has actually surprised me.
I would say, given that the fact that it's the Sunbelt states, and there's actually been work done showing that it looks like basically, if you look at what's called cooling degree days, which is a number of days that people are going to have air conditioning on, there's a very high correlation there.
So what that indicates is that, may be that people are sort of being forced into their homes, and thus, the virus we know spreads much more efficiently inside, especially in situations where air is being recirculated.
So that to me, does not say hey, let's lock down again. That suggests the opposite. That suggests that this may just be a transient problem in these Sunbelt states, but you know, again, I don't -- I'm not going to Pollyanna you, it's not good that ICU beds are filling up, even if the hospitals have capacity.
CARLSON: No, it never will. Sick people are never good. But the question is, how do we respond to it? And it sounds like you haven't moved from your original position, which is outdoors good, indoors bad?
BERENSON: That's correct. And by the way, there's not a lot of evidence that masks would help. I know that some people are saying, well, it's because those states don't have masks. Well, if that's true, how come in Canada, where as far as I know, mask warning is not required, there has not been a resurgence. How come in Europe, there has not been a resurgence post lockdown?
So this seems to be something that's going on, you know, in the Southern United States, and we need to figure out why. It would also help if the rest of the media instead of sort of pointing at the numbers and screaming, you know, I don't want to say they're screaming about how wonderful this is, but there is a tone of I got you. I got you to this -- actually went down to the hospitals and talked to people about what's really driving this.
I've heard -- you know, again, I've heard from some nurses in Dallas, in Houston, who said we are testing people. There are people who are being assessed who are essentially asymptomatic, but COVID positive in our hospitals being counted. But that can't be the reason that we're seeing ICU beds.
So, let's do some real reporting here.
CARLSON: Right. Well, moralizing makes that really hard. As you know, there's an awful lot of that, I would say, but not from you. Alex Berenson, great to see you tonight. Thank you.
BERENSON: Thanks, Tucker.
CARLSON: Meanwhile, the European Union, the E.U. is considering a new travel ban on America. A ban on Americans traveling to Europe in response to coronavirus cases. Fox medical contributor, Dr. Marc Siegel joins us with the latest on this. Doctor, thanks for coming on.
DR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Hi, Tucker. Let's take this back to March 11th when Italy passed 10,000 cases and in the United States here, we had 1,100 confirmed cases and President Trump issued that travel ban where he basically said 26 countries stretching from Iceland to Greece. You couldn't travel to here from Europe.
You know what the European Union did? They were horrified. They called President Trump irresponsible. But looking backward, we see actually that most of our cases, at least on the East Coast came here from Europe because they were receiving cases from China and then on into the United States.
Look today AT June 23RD, when we have 2.4 million cases, and Italy has one- tenth of that. Now, the European Union is getting ready to reopen their borders. Guess who may not be on the list? The United States. Guess who is on the list, Tucker, China, and the European Union is calling our handling of the coronavirus of failure.
Well, maybe it's a failure because when we thought we had 1,100 cases, we probably had over a million or at least several hundred thousand by that point.
Now, you could make a case for this being public health on the part of the European Union. They're saying that if you live in a state or a region where there's less than 50 cases per 100,000 people, maybe then you could travel to the European Union, maybe then you could travel to Europe.
Well, let's see now Montana, South Dakota, Wyoming, you're in. New York, Texas, Arizona, California, you're out. So I think that this will have a huge impact on our economy and I'm actually wondering whether this could have something to do with President Trump this week, saying that foreign workers with visas are not allowed into the country. Could this be retaliatory? Possibly.
Could it be public health? Whatever it is, it's not the tone they sounded back in March when they were horrified at our travel ban at a time when thousands and thousands of cases were coming here.
So, I have a message for the European Union tonight. How about remembering what we did for you in the middle of the 20th Century -- Tucker.
CARLSON: Yes, I think that's worth reminding. This is global power politics at work as always, under the masquerade of public health. Dr. Siegel, thanks so much for explaining that. Good to see you tonight.
CARLSON: Thank you. Thanks, Tucker.
CARLSON: Well, at least 15 FBI agents scrambled down to Alabama to investigate a noose a NASCAR driver claimed he found in his garage. They found exactly what you might expect, another bogus hate crime and when they left, they thanked him. What is going on in this country? We'll explain it after the break.
Also a massive cloud of dust -- a dust storm en route to our country from the Sahara Desert. As if things couldn't get weirder. We'll tell you what that means. Just ahead.
CARLSON: Well, last week, the Mayor of Oakland, California, Libby Schaaf, who tonight is in the running for the worst and most incompetent mayor in the United States promised a hate crime prosecution after what she described as nooses that were discovered in a public park.
After a brief investigation by the local TV station revealed they weren't nooses, they were in fact just ropes with loops at the end. They were put up by local residents for exercise.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Out of the dozens and hundreds and thousands of people that have walked by, no one you know has thought that it looked anywhere close to a noose, right? Folks have used it for exercise. Folks -- it was really a fun addition to the park.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: Yes. Thousands people walked by, none of them thought it was a noose because none of them was half as hysterical as Libby Schaaf or half as political.
It's kind of an amusing story really, but it should have caused the rest of us to pause and reflect for a minute. Every few months, there appears to be new hysteria over nooses discovered somewhere often in a public place, and almost inevitably, the hate crime we are warned about turns out to be fake. The story has been told again and again and again, but our authorities never learned the obvious lesson. This isn't a very racist country.
Sorry, Democratic Party. We understand you want to get elected to power on that premise, but it's just not true and most people know it isn't. When a noose was found in Bubba Wallace's garage, everyone instantly assumed in the media anyway, it was a real hate crime.
Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley who wants to be the Republican nominee next time and wants you to believe she's conservative tweeted this, quote, ""We should all stand with Bubba Wallace today against the cowards who secretly put the noose in his garage stall. Watch your back cowards. Bubba has a bigger army than you do. #HateWon'tWin.""
Nikki Haley believed it immediately, and used it to make the point Nikki Haley often makes which is America is a very racist country. Remember that?
NASCAR President, Steve Phelps, meanwhile, immediately vowed to ban the perpetrator for life. Then ""The Atlantic's"" Jemele Hill used the incident to tar millions of NASCAR fans as racist.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JEMELE HILL, THE ATLANTIC: This reminder, this very stunning, shocking, appalling, disgusting reminder of who, again this fort is for. I'm very curious as to see how NASCAR handles this. Because based off what everything I've read, is that this had to be an inside job because this garage was only open to essential personnel. So somebody associated with NASCAR likely may have been the culprit.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: From the beginning, there were a few who expressed public skepticism, might this be a misunderstanding? Bubba Wallace, who never produced pictures of the noose had a message for anyone who questioned his story. They were stupid, and they were racist.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
QUESTION: What would you say to those people who are doubting that this even happened or that it's true?
BUBBA WALLACE, AMERICAN PROFESSIONAL STOCK CAR RACING DRIVER: Yes, just like Steve Phelps said, it offends me that people would go to those measures. But again, I'm not shocked. It's simple minded people like that, the ones that are afraid of change. They use everything in their power to defend what they stand up for, and instead of trying to listen and understand --
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: Well, the FBI bucked the story completely. They've done nothing to arrest the people who are burning police stations or tearing down monuments of George Washington, but the FBI sent 15 agents to Alabama to investigate the noose, and after days of investigation, they discovered the noose was in fact a rope with a loop used by work crews to pull down a garage door. One of these nooses was present in every garage at Talladega.
Once again, authorities rushed into believe an absurd story, because it could be used to advance a political agenda.
Horace Cooper is author of the book, ""How Trump is Making Black America Great Again,"" and he joins us tonight. Horace Cooper, thanks so much for coming on.
I'm amazed most of all by the response from the authorities, the people in positions of power, in law enforcement, in politics. Why did they react as they did?
HORACE COOPER, AUTHOR: We're all under this grand delusion that racism is running rampant in America. When I was just a little kid, my grandmother told me the story about the Emperor that had no clothes. You may remember this story.
As my grandmother ended the story, she explained, the Emperor was walking around as she said, buck naked. And finally, a little kid said, what everyone saw knew to be true, but was denying.
Well, I've got my own truth bomb. America isn't a racist country. In fact, racism is so hard to find. You have to create these circumstances in order to find one. You remember that guy in Chicago? He had to hire foreigners to do the racism that America just won't do.
CARLSON: We covered the Jussie Smollett story for a month that I never used that line. I wish I had. That is so good. But why -- and I think you're absolutely right, and I think most Americans, no matter who they vote for, understand really that you're telling the truth.
So, the question is, why do they keep telling us this if it's not true? What's the point?
COOPER: Well, part of the problem is it feeds a narrative that some people who sustain themselves politically, it feeds a narrative that they are empowered by solving we come to rescue you from the big Boogeyman racist.
I've got another truth bomb. Whether you're black, white, brown, gay, straight, male, female, all Americans occasionally find they have struggles and setbacks. But because of this narrative, only a few groups are allowed to experience their struggles and their setbacks and their difficulties.
But what that has done is it has divided the rest of America, the rest of America who has a difficulty, who has a struggle. It's not racism. It's not bigotry. America is an amazing place. But as our economy has changed, our elites haven't responded to those changes, and they tell poor people, mostly white, too bad for you.
CARLSON: Because those people don't vote for them. They're never calling the residents of Santa Monica or Cambridge, Mass racist because they're reliable voters.
Horace Cooper that great. Thank you so much for coming on tonight. I appreciate it.
COOPER: Thank you.
CARLSON: We don't want to wreck your evening. But an immense cloud of desert sand from the Sahara is now blowing this way to America. Where will this rank in the long and growing list of 2020s bizarre calamities? Well, parts of the country will feel the effects of this. That's all next.
CARLSON: This is a Fox News Alert. It's about to get very dusty. A plume of airborne desert sand is floating across the Atlantic from North Africa. It's about to arrive here. How will your city or state fare? Fox meteorologist Adam Klotz is tracking the dust storm for us and joins us tonight. Adam, what are we in for?
ADAM KLOTZ, FOX NEWS CHANNEL METEOROLOGIST: Hey there, Tucker. It's not as scary as it sounds. This isn't the end of the world. It's not the next thing kind of lined up in 2020, even though it does feel like that a little bit.
Here's the folks we're going to be talking about seeing this particular system. Every year we get this big, strong winds stretching from Africa, sweeping across the Atlantic Ocean, over the Caribbean through the Gulf of Mexico. This year, maybe a little bit stronger than typical years. But you're seeing that dust plume. It's going to lift up into the desert southeast. It's going to raise up in the southern portions of the Midwest.
Tucker, the actual good news with this is, it's not going -- it's going to suppress any sort of hurricanes, and it's actually going to make for some beautiful sunsets along the Gulf Coast. So this is actually good news. It's not bad news even though it seems scary.
CARLSON: Adam Klotz, a glass half full kind of man.
KLOTZ: You know it. You know it.
CARLSON: Thank you. What a nice end to the hour. Great to see you.
KLOTZ: Good to see you.
CARLSON: That's it for us tonight, but there is more. The Great Sean Hannity stands by in New York, Andrew Cuomo's state. Take it away."

As the FBI continues its investigation, Jewish leaders are speaking out about proactive ways to mitigate further incidents.
""Nothing like this has ever happened in my hometown. I've never experienced antisemitism before,"" Dina Silberstein told The Jerusalem Post. Silberstein, 37, is an alumna of North Shore Hebrew Academy, a Modern Orthodox yeshiva in Nassau County. On the fifth night of Hanukkah, the academy's website was hacked, compromising students' private information and targeting the community with antisemitic threats and slurs.
On the school's homepage, the North Shore logo was replaced with a swastika, the background image was changed to a Nazi concentration camp and the school's name was modified to ""North Shore Hebrew Concentration Camp."" Its address was changed to that of Auschwitz-Birkenau.
On another page, the hackers posted a picture of Hitler titled ""Der Fuhrer Adolf Hitler,"" and changed the school's mission statement to read: ""[At the] North Shore Concentration Camp... we believe in executing our Jews, not merely deporting them... we don't want our Jews to continue being rats to finally erasing them from this Earth is much preferred.""
Silberstein, the granddaughter of Holocaust survivors, said she learned about the attack when her sister texted photos. ""We knew we had to do something, so I reached out to the ADL right away. They told me they had just heard and were in the process of organizing a webinar in response.""
Roughly 200 people attended the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) webinar on Friday, December 18, many of whom are North Shore alumni or parents. The panel, which was about securing schools from cyberhate and online harassment, featured ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt and supervisory special agent of the FBI Chris Donohue.
Scott Richman, ADL regional director for New York and New Jersey, moderated the panel. Richman told the Post that the webinar was targeted to parents, but was also open to the general public.
""We took inspiration from the fact that this attack happened this week because we received many calls from parents who are concerned, but this webinar is useful for everybody. Cybercrimes don't just happen in school settings, but schools are particularly vulnerable,"" he said.
""The webinar was a major part of our response to what happened at North Shore, because it's not just about this one school. Of course we want to assist the school, but I also want to go beyond that and use this as a teachable moment,"" Richman continued.
""Our goal is to educate everybody on cyber crime so they are aware and also can learn concrete ways to mitigate either before it happens or when it does happen and what to do afterwards. This is an all hands on deck effort and people need to understand what's going on.""
Silberstein said the webinar was ""informative.""
""It was good to hear firsthand how law enforcement and ADL staff approach these things. We heard about ADL's task force which specifically tracks online groups they're keeping an eye on, like white supremacists.""
She noted that the discussion did not touch on how New York State authorities respond to antisemitism. ""That would be good to hear because now that I live in Manhattan, I'm kind of in a microcosm,"" she said.
The state reportedly sent its Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services' Cyber Incident Response Team to assess the school's cybersecurity practices. The FBI took over the ongoing investigation on December 16.
""This antisemitic attack is simply despicable, and the fact that it came as the school community celebrated Hanukkah makes it even more repulsive,"" Governor Andrew Cuomo said in a statement. ""New York State will deploy resources to help the staff, parents and students [of] North Shore Hebrew Academy in the aftermath of this senseless act.""
""By deploying these resources, we are sending a message loud and clear that hate has no place in our state - online or in person - and that New York will always support and protect those targeted for crimes based on who they are or what they believe,"" Cuomo added.
Nassau County is home to a significant Jewish population, roughly 230,000 as of 2013. North Shore Hebrew Academy, which serves more than 1,000 children, did not respond to a request for comment.
Evan Bernstein, CEO of Community Security Service (CSS), an organization that has trained thousands of Jewish volunteers in preventing antisemitic attacks, expressed concern over the hacking.
""This is yet another example that shows antisemitism is alive and making a direct impact on our communities. We encourage all institutions to remain vigilant,"" Bernstein said. He noted that CSS monitored other reported hate crimes during Hanukkah, including in Kentucky when a Jewish man was run over at a menorah lighting ceremony by a driver yelling antisemitic slurs. In New York City, antisemitic graffiti was allegedly spray painted on a homeowner's fence on December 16.
Hate crimes hit their highest level in over a decade last year, according to the FBI. The majority of anti-religious hate crimes, which made up about 20 percent of all reported crimes, were motivated by anti-Jewish bias.
But Richman said that when it comes to cyberattacks, the North Shore hacking stands out.
""We've seen a great rise of cyber crimes over the past few years. COVID certainly has brought a lot of Zoom bombing. But we've seen nothing of this nature.""

Wallace, the stock car circuit's only black, full-time driver, found the noose in his garage Sunday afternoon at Talladega Superspeedway. The FBI was called in to investigate a possible hate crime.
But the Bureau said in a statement Tuesday that the rope in question had been tied like a noose in that garage since October 2019, citing video evidence ""confirmed by NASCAR.""
""Although the noose is now known to have been in garage number 4 in 2019, nobody could have known Mr. Wallace would be assigned to garage number 4 last week,"" the FBI said, deciding that no hate crime had been committed.
NASCAR assigns garages the week before races.
Wallace had led the push to ban the Confederate flag from NASCAR races and has been targeted with hate since, including outside the track Sunday at Talladega.
Other drivers stood behind Wallace after the noose was discovered, and NASCAR denounced the act.
""We appreciate the FBI's quick and thorough investigation and are thankful to learn this was not an intentional, racist act against Bubba,"" NASCAR said in its own statement Tuesday. ""We remain steadfast in our commitment to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all who love racing.""
Wallace finished 14th in the race at Talladega, which was held Monday after inclement weather postponed it one day.
A crew member for Richard Petty Motorsports discovered the noose Sunday at the Alabama race track. NASCAR was alerted and contacted the FBI.
The Wood Brothers Racing team said one of its employees informed the team he recalled ""seeing a tied handle in the garage pull down rope from last fall,"" when NASCAR raced at Talladega in October. The team said it immediately alerted NASCAR and assisted the investigation."

Stephanie Rapkin, who's white, sparked outrage over the weekend after she spat on a black teen during a peaceful march in the Milwaukee suburb of Shorewood on June 6. She was charged and released before getting in trouble again the following day, when she was filmed shoving a college student who was writing protest messages on a sidewalk outside her home.
The 64-year-old, who allegedly struck an officer in the groin during her arrest June 7, was initially charged with battery, battery to a law enforcement officer, resisting arrest and disorderly conduct. But the Milwaukee County District Attorney's Office took over the investigation and decided to charge her Friday with felony disorderly conduct as a hate crime, which carries a maximum sentence of two years in prison.
In the spitting incident, prosecutors said the woman ""intentionally selected the person against whom the crime was committed in whole or in part because of the defendant's belief or perception regarding the race of that person,"" according to a criminal complaint obtained by the local news station WTMJ.
Multiple videos show her parking a car in the middle of a road in an apparent attempt to block a rally against racism and police brutality, walking out of the vehicle and getting into an argument with several protesters.
Rapkin kept shouting back as they urged her to move the car and then suddenly spat on a young teenager -her saliva striking him in the face and shirt, the complaint states. The attack happened moments after the victim began chanting, ""I'm black and I'm proud,"" he told police.

A man who the authorities say drove into a group of Black people at a Southern California hotel, injuring one person, has been accused of a hate crime, prosecutors said on Monday.
The man, Dennis Wyman, 42, of Redondo Beach, struck an off-duty security guard after he yelled “racial insults” at the group last month, the Torrance Police Department said in a statement.
Mr. Wyman faces two charges of assault with a deadly weapon and one charge of hit-and-run driving resulting in serious injury to another person, “with the special allegation that the alleged crimes were hate crimes,” the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office said in a statement. It was not immediately clear whether Mr. Wyman had a lawyer.
The police said that, not long before midnight on June 29, Mr. Wyman began hurling insults at a small group of Black people in a parking lot at the Staybridge Suites, a hotel that the group was visiting in Torrance, a coastal city in southwest Los Angeles County.
Mr. Wyman then entered his car, a Chevrolet El Camino, and drove it toward the group, the police said.
An off-duty security guard at the parking lot fired several shots before he was struck by the car, according to the police. Mr. Wyman then fled the scene, the police said. The guard, 50, was treated by the Torrance Fire Department before he was taken to a hospital for injuries to his lower extremities. He was the only person struck and was in stable condition on Tuesday, said Sgt. Alexander Martinez of the Torrance Police Department.
The police said that detectives identified Mr. Wyman as a suspect and that he was arrested during a traffic stop on July 8.
His arraignment, which began on Monday, was expected to continue on Tuesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court in Torrance. Mr. Wyman’s bail was set at $115,000, the district attorney’s office said. If convicted, he faces a possible maximum sentence of 12 years in prison.
The authorities provided no details about a possible motivation.
Though the police said the people at the hotel were guests and not protesters, the charges come after dozens of similar incidents in recent weeks of drivers accelerating into crowds at demonstrations across the country against racism and police violence. At least two other cases have resulted in charges this month: A man was charged with vehicular homicide in Seattle, and a woman was charged with criminal recklessness, a felony, in Bloomington, Ind.

February 22, 2021
The Governor's Advisory Commission on Asian Pacific American Affairs condemns the recent attacks on Asian Pacific Americans across the nation and calls for all Pennsylvanians to stand up against anti-Asian hate and racism in all forms.
From Oakland, California to Brooklyn, New York, innocent Asian elders have been severely injured or killed in wanton acts of violence. Here in Pennsylvania, witnesses have reported more insidious forms of hate, including threats of bodily harm to Asian American high school students and the casual use of the term ""COVID"" to name Asian-influenced food. This targeting of our Asian and Asian American community members is part of a long history of anti-Asian racism in the United States - from the Chinese Exclusion Act to Japanese Internment during World War II. Hate and racism have no place in Pennsylvania. Whether it is hateful rhetoric against a religion; discriminating against someone from receiving service because of their gender identity; or excessive use of violence by police because of the color of a person's skin; we stand against all forms of social injustice.
If you see a hate crime occur, call 9-1-1. Non-emergency hate crimes and discriminatory acts should be reported to state and local police, the FBI, the Governor's Office of Homeland Security, or the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission.

A Black Lives Matter mural outside of Chicago was painted over to read All Lives Matter earlier this week, the latest occurrence of what has become a nationwide trend in recent weeks of vandals defacing similar BLM murals, as the U.S. painfully comes to terms with an evolving public dialogue centered around racism following the death of George Floyd.
KEY FACTS
A portion of a street mural, which had been completed just two weeks ago in Oak Park (an Illinois neighborhood north of Chicago), wasvandalizedovernight Tuesday into Wednesday.
Overnight Monday into Tuesday, in Martinez, California, local police opened an investigation after White Lives Matter was illegally painted onto a roadway.
Just three days earlier in Martinez, a couple (who would later be charged with ahate crime) was filmed vandalizing a city-approved Black Lives Matter mural, located outside a courthouse.
On Monday, statepolice in Vermontinformed the Attorney General s Office that two Black Lives Matter roadway murals and a Black Trans Lives Matter mural were defaced.
Last month in Baltimore,chalk messageswritten by elementary students on their school s walls in support of the Black Lives Matter movement were power-washed away by adults.
Tire markswere left across a Black Lives Matter mural in uptown Charlotte in early June.
Key Background:
Black Lives Matter originated in 2013, but according torecent polling data, there has been a significant shift in how American citizens view the movement. APew Research surveylast month found that roughly 67% of U.S. adults support the BLM movement, with 38% saying they strongly support it. In early June, a Monmouth University poll found that 76% of Americans now consider racism and discrimination a big problem, whereas only half the country agreed with that sentiment as recently as five years ago. According to data analyzed by theNew York Times, about15 million to 26 millionpeople in the United States participated in demonstrations over the death of George Floyd and others in recent weeks. These figures would make the recent protests the largest movement in the country s history. 
Tangent:
Last week, President Trump inflamed tensions on both sides of the debate when he declared that a Black Lives Matter mural painted on a New York City street would be a symbol of hate. In a series of tweets,Trump addedthat painting a big, expensive, yellow Black Lives Matter sign on Fifth Avenue (which, coincidentally, is home to his flagship building, Trump Tower) would denigrate the street. Nonetheless, themural was completedThursday afternoon. 
Critical Quote:
 The president is a disgrace to the values we cherish in New York City, Julia Arredondo, a spokeswoman for NYC Mayor Bill De Blasio,saidearlier this month. He can t run or deny the reality we are facing, and anytime he wants to set foot in the place he claims is his hometown, he should be reminded that Black lives matter.

NEW YORK: Governor of the U.S. state of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced a reform agenda to address police brutality, especially against minority communities, following the death of Minnesota man George Floyd.
The ""Say Their Name"" agenda will make prior disciplinary records of law enforcement officers transparent, ban chokeholds and make false race-based 911 reports a hate crime, said Cuomo at his daily briefing.
Meanwhile, the state's attorney general will work as an independent prosecutor for deaths of unarmed civilians caused by law enforcement, he said.
""Mr. Floyd's murder was the breaking point of a long list of deaths that were unnecessary and abusive, and people are saying 'enough is enough,'"" said Cuomo.
The governor pointed out that stopping police abuse vindicates the ""99.9 percent of police who are there to do the right thing"" and would also make the community-police relationship work better, he added.
Cuomo said New York should lead the charge and he would work with the state legislature to pass the agenda next week.
Confrontations -- some times violent -- between protesters and police have erupted during demonstrations nationwide during the past week. The governor said Thursday's incident in Buffalo of upstate New York between two officers and a 75-year-old man was ""wholly unjustified and utterly disgraceful.""
In a video circulating online, two heavily-armed officer pushed the man, who approached them alone during a protest over George Floyd's death, while asking him to move back.
The man tripped and fell backward with his head hitting the ground. Blood was seen coming from his head while no officer came to tend him immediately, as the video showed.
""Why? Why was that necessary? Where was the threat?"" Cuomo questioned. ""It's just fundamentally offensive and frightening. How did we get to this place?""
The governor said he had spoken with Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown and they agreed that the officers involved should be immediately suspended, a decision that was announced late on Thursday.
Cuomo said he had also spoken on the phone with the old man, who was in serious condition but is ""thankfully alive.""
""I believe the district attorney is looking into it from a possible criminal liability point of view, and I applaud the district attorney for moving quickly,"" the governor added.

Eleven years later he returned to set the building on fire, the police say.
The authorities have charged a man with arson and a related hate crime after a fire caused significant damage to an Islamic center in Cape Girardeau, Mo., on the first full day of Ramadan.
The man, Nicholas J. Proffitt, 42, was arrested on Monday and charged with burglary, arson and property damage motivated by discrimination, all in the first degree. He is being held without bond at the Cape Girardeau Police Department, the police said.
“We thought that Covid-19 was our biggest problem,” Dr. Ahmad Sheikh, 44, an endocrinologist who has worshiped at the center, said on Tuesday. “This happened a few minutes before our fast started.”
The Police Department said in a Facebook post that Mr. Proffitt was motivated to set the fire on Friday by “the religion of the people who worship at the Islamic Center.” No one was injured in the fire, but the damage was enough to cause the city to condemn the building, the police said.
“We are dedicated to rebuilding,” Shafiq Malik, the president of the Islamic center, said on Tuesday. “Our community here is fantastic, they are so loving and caring. All the churches and people have solidarity with us.”
This is the second time Mr. Proffitt has been charged with a hate crime, according to court documents. In 2009, Mr. Proffitt threw rocks at the center, Dr. Sheikh said. Mr. Proffitt pleaded guilty to two charges of property damage motivated by discrimination and was sentenced to three years in prison, according to court documents.
“I was very surprised it was him because last time he said he was drunk and was very sorry and that he didn’t mean to do it,” Mr. Malik said. “Now he definitely has anti-Muslim sentiment.”
The fire was initially deemed “suspicious in nature” by the authorities and was investigated by the F.B.I.; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the Missouri fire marshal; and the Perryville Police Department, according to Sgt. Joseph Hann, a spokesman for the Cape Girardeau Police Department.
The Islamic Center of Cape Girardeau was established in 1999 and, apart from the episodes involving Mr. Proffitt, has not had any other incidents, Mr. Malik said.
“It was shocking but comforting to know that it is not a new person that doesn’t like us,” he said. “It is not only an attack on the Muslim community, it is an attack on the Cape Girardeau community.”
Friday was the first day of fasting in the holy month of Ramadan, when Muslims believe God revealed the Quran to the Prophet Muhammad. Those who are able to fast from dawn to dusk.
The Islamic center has become an integral part of the community in Cape Girardeau, a city of close to 40,000 that is 115 miles southeast of St. Louis, holding interfaith programs and back-to-school events, Dr. Sheikh said.
“Cape Girardeau is strong,” Mr. Malik said. “We will not let this one person with the hatred win.”

According to the New York State police[1], 19-year-old Olivia R. Cinquinio was '[c]aught red handed with stolen political signs' and later admitted to committing the crime. The press release issued by law enforcement does not specify which candidate Cinquinio was allegedly targeting before being apprehended-but a photograph included in the news bulletin gives a fairly decent suggestion; most of the yard signs appear to be in support of President Donald Trump's reelection campaign. 
Troopers say they were originally dispatched to Clarence, N.Y., about half an hour east-northeast of downtown Buffalo, in order to respond to a call regarding theft of lawn signs in progress during the final debate between the 45th president and former vice president Joe Biden. The responding officers said the person who complained to them was following the alleged thief in their own car before the troopers themselves initiated a traffic stop after being able to see some of the stolen signs in question. 'While patrolling to [the] location, the complainant started following the suspect vehicle on Main Street and turned onto Transit Road when Troopers initiated a traffic stop,' the press release notes. 'Troopers observed multiple political signs in plain view while interviewing the operator, Cinquinio who later confesses to stealing signs off multiple yards.' Cinquinio was then arrested and charged with petit larceny-the lowest-level theft offense in New York State law. The charge is a Class A misdemeanor in the Empire State[2] with a maximum penalty of one year in prison and/or a $1,000 fine. Imposing the maximum penalty for any crime-let alone a non-violent minor personal property crime-is exceedingly unlikely. Yard sign theft is a perennial aspect of the American electoral experience and have been especially amplified and pronounced during the Trump political era. In November 2016[3], a then-79-year-old woman in Kansas was repeatedly the target and victim of anti-Trump yard sign theft. Her plight elicited multiple stories from multiple media outlets. Notably, theft of Hillary Clinton signs during that same election was also very common. In a bizarre moment from 2018 with First Amendment implications[4], Marion Stanford's anti-GOP/anti-Brett Kavanaugh yard sign was stolen by local police in Hamilton, Texas-instantly catapulting her story into the national spotlight as the midterm elections were then just one month away. After a massive media backlash, the yard sign was returned to its owner. Expressions of anti-political symbolism have also often resulted in more extreme alleged crimes over the past few years. In August 2019[5], an art gallery owner was allegedly assaulted by a large group of youths over his 'Make America Great Again' (MAGA) hat. Last month[6], two women were charged with a hate crime for stealing a MAGA hat from a seven-year-old-an incident that was caught on tape. Cinquinio was issued a bench notice and is currently slated to appear in court on November 3-which just so happens to be Election Day.

As the FBI continues its investigation, Jewish leaders are speaking out about proactive ways to mitigate further incidents. 
""Nothing like this has ever happened in my hometown. I've never experienced antisemitism before,"" Dina Silberstein told The Jerusalem Post. Silberstein, 37, is an alumna of North Shore Hebrew Academy, a Modern Orthodox yeshiva in Nassau County. On the fifth night of Hanukkah, the academy's website was hacked, compromising students' private information and targeting the community with antisemitic threats and slurs. 
 On the school's homepage, the North Shore logo was replaced with a swastika, the background image was changed to a Nazi concentration camp and the school's name was modified to ""North Shore Hebrew Concentration Camp."" Its address was changed to that of Auschwitz-Birkenau. 
On another page, the hackers posted a picture of Hitler titled ""Der Fuhrer Adolf Hitler,"" and changed the school's mission statement to read: ""[At the] North Shore Concentration Camp… we believe in executing our Jews, not merely deporting them… we don't want our Jews to continue being rats to finally erasing them from this Earth is much preferred."" 
Silberstein, the granddaughter of Holocaust survivors, said she learned about the attack when her sister texted photos. ""We knew we had to do something, so I reached out to the ADL right away. They told me they had just heard and were in the process of organizing a webinar in response.""
Roughly 200 people attended the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) webinar on Friday, December 18, many of whom are North Shore alumni or parents. The panel, which was about securing schools from cyberhate and online harassment, featured ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt and supervisory special agent of the FBI Chris Donohue. 
Scott Richman, ADL regional director for New York and New Jersey, moderated the panel. Richman told the Post that the webinar was targeted to parents, but was also open to the general public. 
 cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });
""We took inspiration from the fact that this attack happened this week because we received many calls from parents who are concerned, but this webinar is useful for everybody. Cybercrimes don't just happen in school settings, but schools are particularly vulnerable,"" he said. 
""The webinar was a major part of our response to what happened at North Shore, because it's not just about this one school. Of course we want to assist the school, but I also want to go beyond that and use this as a teachable moment,"" Richman continued. 
""Our goal is to educate everybody on cyber crime so they are aware and also can learn concrete ways to mitigate either before it happens or when it does happen and what to do afterwards. This is an all hands on deck effort and people need to understand what's going on."" 
Silberstein said the webinar was ""informative.""
""It was good to hear firsthand how law enforcement and ADL staff approach these things. We heard about ADL's task force which specifically tracks online groups they're keeping an eye on, like white supremacists."" 
She noted that the discussion did not touch on how New York State authorities respond to antisemitism. ""That would be good to hear because now that I live in Manhattan, I'm kind of in a microcosm,"" she said. 
The state reportedly sent its Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services' Cyber Incident Response Team to assess the school's cybersecurity practices. The FBI took over the ongoing investigation on December 16. 
""This antisemitic attack is simply despicable, and the fact that it came as the school community celebrated Hanukkah makes it even more repulsive,"" Governor Andrew Cuomo said in a statement. ""New York State will deploy resources to help the staff, parents and students [of] North Shore Hebrew Academy in the aftermath of this senseless act.""
""By deploying these resources, we are sending a message loud and clear that hate has no place in our state – online or in person – and that New York will always support and protect those targeted for crimes based on who they are or what they believe,"" Cuomo added. 
Nassau County is home to a significant Jewish population, roughly 230,000 as of 2013. North Shore Hebrew Academy, which serves more than 1,000 children, did not respond to a request for comment. 
Evan Bernstein, CEO of Community Security Service (CSS), an organization that has trained thousands of Jewish volunteers in preventing antisemitic attacks, expressed concern over the hacking. 
""This is yet another example that shows antisemitism is alive and making a direct impact on our communities. We encourage all institutions to remain vigilant,"" Bernstein said. He noted that CSS monitored other reported hate crimes during Hanukkah, including in Kentucky when a Jewish man was run over at a menorah lighting ceremony by a driver yelling antisemitic slurs. In New York City, antisemitic graffiti was allegedly spray painted on a homeowner's fence on December 16. 
Hate crimes hit their highest level in over a decade last year, according to the FBI. The majority of anti-religious hate crimes, which made up about 20 percent of all reported crimes, were motivated by anti-Jewish bias. 
But Richman said that when it comes to cyberattacks, the North Shore hacking stands out. 
""We've seen a great rise of cyber crimes over the past few years. COVID certainly has brought a lot of Zoom bombing. But we've seen nothing of this nature.""

I completely asked him some space and he said what did you say to me, 'chink'? Any cut in front of me. I was focusing on an increase in hate crimes against Asian-Americans since Tom had made his first reference to a Chinese virus before that incident that I wanted to believe my experience was kind of an isolated incident since I live in such a racially and culturally diverse city like New York city. So Haruka, that happened to you and you start asking around and realise this isn't an isolated incident? Right, so I started to realise that there was a pattern of these incidents and I started to do some research, I found several Facebook groups where Asian-Americans were self-supporting incidents of racial aggression via text and video and I came across advocacy organisations that compiled a virtual map of aggravated incident reports from Asian-Americans who had experienced racial aggressions across the US and this virtual map already included up to 1000 cases by the time I was conducting the research but that number currently surpasses 1500 and interestingly enough, the NYPD hate crimes statistics summary at this point included only one report of hate crime towards Asians at this point, so as you can imagine the numbers weren't really adding up and I was shocked to hear the statistics, to be honest. Underreporting has always issue, our experiences would be confined to these on line spaces are never be taken seriously unless we do the documenting ourselves. So let's look at some of the documenting. I know you've got a whole series of case studies. If we we take a couple, Justin, for example, tell me his story. Yes, so Justin is a registered nurse who was harassed by a man on his way home on the subway, and the man made a reference to chinks spreading all this sickness, and telling him to go back to his country. It was particularly heartbreaking about Justin's story was that this is one of many incidents that he had transportation, right? And ironically Justin also had experienced more harassment than perhaps the rest of us because he had made the conscientious choice to discrimination kind of layering themselves on top of one another. Ida Chen, for example. Right, so Ida man who said something to the effect of a would-be interview if you didn't carry the virus. Racial assault directed at Asian women are some of the strongest. We hear that men only want to date us because they have an Asian fetish because Dominic to morph verbally explicit forms like what Ida had experienced. And from my own personal experience it can be especially difficult to respond in these kinds of circumstances, because Asian American women tend to experience these harder forms of micro- aggression on a regular basis, to the point where some of us may have internalised these narratives, and it may become increasingly more difficult for some of us to distinguish what is acceptable, low-key racism versus what isn't. One thing that I also noticed, when Asian-Americans speak about their experiences, you know, a common follow-up question has usually been,"

Now he's considering a return to Japan.
He came to New York from Tokyo to make it as a jazz musician, and he did, landing gigs in several touring bands and leading a trio of his own. He was elegant but never flashy on the piano, always well prepared and on time. 
 It was not an easy path. On Sept. 27, at around 7:20 in the evening, that path got a lot harder.
 Coming off the subway at West 135th Street after a video shoot, Tadataka Unno, 40, a new father, encountered a group of about eight young people who blocked his way to the turnstiles. When he tried to pass through, one of them shoved him from behind. Another said he had pushed her, and a young man near her said, ''My girl is pregnant.''
 That's when the beating started -- first in the subway station and then up on the street, where he yelled for people to help him, to no avail.
 ''I thought that this was how I was going to die,'' he recalled two weeks later, describing the attack in a written note because it was still painful to talk about it. He did not know how many in the group had hit him. They fractured his right collarbone, injured his arm and bruised him all over. After surgery for the broken bones, he was not sure whether he will ever be able to play the piano again. He has been unable to use his right hand at all, and said he is learning to do everything with his left hand.
 The police have made no arrests, though Mr. Unno said the assault was captured on camera in the subway station. He remembered at least one of the attackers calling him ''Asian'' and ''Chinese,'' along with a profanity.
 'I needed to know the culture.'
 How quickly does a life change course?
 Tadataka Unno was fated to arrive in New York. He started playing jazz piano at age 9, and playing professionally in Japan at 18. The work was steady and gratifying, with recording opportunities and gigs almost every night. But, after a decade, he felt there was something missing, he said in a telephone interview. He could listen to records in Japan, but jazz was more than recordings. ''I needed to know the culture,'' he said.
 In 2008, when he was 27, his mother cried when he said he was moving to New York, told him not to go. She thought New York was dangerous.
 ''I wanted to meet my heroes, to play with them, to talk, to hang out,'' he said. ''If I stay in Japan it'll never happen.''
 He and his wife, Sayaka, arrived in Harlem on June 19, 2008. Harlem was where jazz history lived. ''I didn't know anybody,'' he said. ''I didn't have any job. But I didn't worry about it. I was just happy to be in New York.''
 New York breaks those dreams more often than not. But Mr. Unno made them work.
 ''He's one of the workman jazz piano players on the New York scene,'' said Spike Wilner, a pianist who owns and runs Smalls and Mezzrow, two clubs downtown. ''He works hard, practices hard, but he's not necessarily high profile. But he's a tasty pianist, elegant. And a sweetheart of a guy, very gentle. He calls me Spike-san, and I call him Tada-san. Everybody loves him.''
 He got work playing with Jimmy Cobb, who played drums on Miles Davis's album ''Kind of Blue,'' which is like being second from the end at Mount Rushmore. This led to a two-year stint with the trumpeter Roy Hargrove, a phenom closer to Mr. Unno's generation.
 ''That was a historical moment, because Roy never hired an Asian guy before me,'' Mr. Unno said with obvious pride. Mr. Hargrove died of cardiac arrest brought on by kidney disease two years ago, at age 49. Mr. Unno was his last regular pianist. ''He gave me so much love and culture, history,'' Mr. Unno said. ''I feel I have a responsibility for what I learned from him. I need to make it my own way, through my music.''
 Mr. Unno was always keenly aware of the racial dynamic of jazz, that he was working in a music genre developed by African-Americans, said his friend Jerome Jennings, a drummer and jazz educator who met him back in Japan.
 ''He was always asking questions to get a better understanding of the culture,'' Mr. Jennings said. ''There's a song lyric, 'You can keep your Dixie/Drop me off in Harlem.' Tada asked me, 'What does Dixie mean?' He was totally open to ingesting the culture and understanding it by any means. He just soaked it up. Living in Harlem was part of that. He understood it was where all those great musicians lived. He knew the importance.''
 By 2020, most of what he had envisioned when he left Tokyo for New York had come his way. He had peers, recognition and music. In June he and his wife had their first child, a son.
 ''He was so happy,'' Mr. Wilner said. ''Of course, it puts a lot of pressure on him to keep working, keep things coming in. But he's very excited.''
 The racial epithet
 As the attack went on, Mr. Unno said he was saved by a woman who called for an ambulance, which took him to Harlem Hospital Center. He was in shock from the beating and from the unwillingness of bystanders to step in. Nothing like this had ever happened to him before. He could not move his arm, and would have to return for surgery. At home, he said, he felt like his wife had ''two babies to take care of.''
 On Oct. 3, Mr. Jennings created a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for medical bills and other expenses. Since the start of the pandemic in March, Mr. Unno, like other musicians, had been unable to earn money by performing. Now his downtime was indefinite, with a baby at home and bills piling up.
 The GoFundMe campaign, which made no mention of any racial remarks made by the attackers, surpassed its modest goal of $25,000 on the first day. The money kept coming in, with posts on social media spreading the word and wishing Mr. Unno a full recovery.
 Then on Oct. 6, the Japanese news outlet Asahi Shimbun quoted Mr. Unno saying that one of the attackers had used the word ''Chinese'' during the attack. Other outlets in Asia and the United States picked up the story, emphasizing the slur. ''Japanese Musician Beaten Up in New York for Being 'Chinese,''' ran the headline in Japan Today. Many noted that crimes against Asian-Americans have risen since the start of the pandemic, which Donald Trump has repeatedly blamed on China.
 The tenor of social media posts changed. Now it was a story about racism, about ''white thugs'' inspired by Mr. Trump in one post, or, in a Twitter post soon after, about ''racist blacks in Harlem'' who ''get away with racial slurs and violence.''
 As a window on racial violence rather than a random assault, social media posts spread beyond jazz circles. Grace Meng, a congresswoman representing part of Queens, wrote that ''Hate -- against AAPIs and against any community -- has no place in New York,'' using the abbreviation for Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders. Any uncertainty about the attackers' motives seemed to evaporate.
 Mr. Unno received an outpouring of messages from Japanese Americans who recounted their own experiences with racism. He was astonished by their number. As he read the messages, he said, ''My pain was their pain.''
 But the motives behind a seemingly senseless crime can be hard to know with certainty.
 The police have found no indication that the group attacked Mr. Unno because of his race, and have not classified the attack as a bias crime. Mr. Unno said the attack was a ''blur,'' but that he was sure he had heard the slur. There was no evidence that Mr. Trump's influence had a role in the attack.
 An officer from the police department's Asian Hate Crime Task Force, which formed in August because of the rise in violence, interviewed Mr. Unno but did not consider the attack to be motivated by race.
 Mr. Jennings cautioned against calling it a hate crime without more evidence. The attackers, he said, were young people in a time of heightened stress and anger. ''I think some of the papers are spinning a bit,'' he said.
 The GoFundMe campaign recently passed $165,000.
 Mr. Unno said he still needed ''very strong painkillers'' to get through the day. He is unable to play piano or hold his son, and does not know how much function he will regain. Even as he worries about his physical recovery, he fears that recovering from the emotional trauma may be even more difficult. Since the attack he has not left the apartment except for medical treatments because he is afraid. He does not think he could recognize the attackers, because he lost his glasses with the first blows.
 Until the attack, he had never experienced racism in New York, he said, and it shook him. He had come to the city to mix with people not like him, and now he was suffering for this difference.
 He said he was considering leaving the city that once drew him like the sun, possibly returning to Japan. ''My wife and I worry about raising kids here, especially after this happened,'' he said.
 The messages from other Asian-Americans talking about their own ordeals, he said, brought home that ''there isn't a major movement like Black Lives Matter that creates a space for Asians to talk about these issues.''
 That needed to change, he said. ''The Asian community is not so tight. Asian people need to stand up and take action.''

We begin with the U.S. entering a critical phase in the fight to slow coronavirus. There are now 26 states headed in the wrong direction. We say it every morning but this is a count that keeps ticking up day-by- day, including new case records in California and Texas, the most populous states in the nation.

DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY & INFECTIOUS DISEASES: We're now seeing a disturbing surge of infections that looks like it's a combination but one of the things is an increase in community spread. We were going down from 30,000 to 25,000 to 20,000, and now we sort of stayed about flat and now, we're going up.

Senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen has more takeaways from that hearing.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Dr. Robert Redfield, the head of the CDC, said they developed a new test that can test for two strains of flu and for COVID-19, all in one test. Now this is really important. This could save a lot of time for labs, a lot of resources, could even save lives because it can test people more quickly. The symptoms for flu and COVID are so similar that many people will need both tests now they can do it all at one time.
Also at the hearing, Dr. Redfield talked about the importance of getting a flu shot every year but especially this year. That's because having flu on top of COVID could be a real disaster. It will certainly place a stress on our hospitals and our health care system, only 45 percent of American adults gate flu shot. Dr. Redfield urged more to get a flu shot this year.
REDFIELD: This fall before the seasonal circulation of influenza increases I encourage the American people to be prepared and to embrace flu vaccination with confidence for yourself, your families and the communities. This single act will save lives.
COHEN: And speaking of testing, the nation's top infectious disease doctor, Dr. Anthony Fauci, told Congress that he flinched a little when he heard the term Operation Warp Speed. That's the name President Trump gave to his effort to get a COVID vaccine out. President Trump said it will happen in record speed but Dr. Fauci said there will not be a vaccine put out on the market until rigorous testing has been done to make sure that it works and to make sure that it's safe -- Laura.

CNN's Erica Hill has more on all that.

ERICA HILL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Good morning.
Some sobering new records being set in Arizona and Texas on Tuesday. Record single day highs for new case and in Texas, a record too for hospitalizations. Harris County, which is home to Houston, really seeing a spike there. In fact, Texas Children's Hospital said it's now admitting adults to deal with the surge. Governor Abbott in Texas warning the safest place for people to be is in their homes, and that if the surge continues, they may have to bring up some restrictions.
Meantime, 17 high schoolers in Ohio who took a trip to Myrtle Beach have now tested positive. Well, none have been hospitalized. Local health officials say they are concerned about the spread.
In Tennessee, half of all new cases have been linked to community spread. And in Washington, Governor Jay Inslee on Tuesday afternoon announcing that as of Friday everyone in the state needs to wear a face coverings when they are indoors or outdoors if they can't socially distance.
We're also seeing more younger people test positive. In New Jersey, 22 percent of cases are for people between 18 and 29. That's up 10 percent since April.
Laura, back to you.

JARRETT: Erica, thanks so much for that.
The European Union is considering a ban on travelers from the United States because of coronavirus. If the E.U. goes through with it, the move would be a glaring rebuke of how President Trump has handled the pandemic.
CNN's Melissa Bell is live for us in Paris.
Melissa, a final decision hasn't been made yet but it will be a serious blow to the U.S.. What do you think might the tip the scales?
MELISSA BELL, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, essentially, the criteria, Laura, that's being used by the European Union to decide what countries after July 1st will be able to have access once again, will be able to get on flights to European cities the criteria is super simple. The idea is does that country have the same level of fight back against the epidemic, are they at the same level as Europe which really has largely returned to normal with largely lower figures for new coronavirus case kept down overall. Are they doing as well or better than Europe?
And if the answer to that is no, then the citizens of that country simply will not be allowed to travel. For the time being, according to that objective criteria, American citizens wouldn't be able to travel to Europe neither would Brazilian citizens. So, that is what the E.U. is looking at that, because, of course, the internal borders now open within the bloc are so important. This is about getting Europe's economy back on track, the bloc really keen to reopen its borders to the outside world now that it re-opened its internal borders.
The question is whether they will go through with the idea of banning more Americans for sometime more. And, of course, as you say, that would be a billion terms of how the United States has been seen objectively and from elsewhere to handle the epidemic.
JARRETT: Yes. So, certainly, the United States blocked travelers from the European Union from coming to our shores when we were worried about the explosion of the virus there earlier this year.
All right. Melissa, nice to see you this morning. Thanks.
All right. The FBI has determined that NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace was not actually the target of a hate crime. Andy Scholes has more in this morning's ""Bleacher Report"".
Hey, Andy. You know, this is sort of a crazy development. NASCAR is saying it was a garage pull. The FBI still calling it a noose.
ANDY SCHOLES, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it certainly was a surprising turn, Laura. Good morning to you.
So, Bubba Wallace, of course, is NASCAR's only black driver at their top level and after a noose was discovered in his garage on Sunday, the FBI was called in to investigate and the they say there was no hate crime here.
So I'll show you. This is the noose that was found by a member of Wallace's team. Now, the FBI says it had been in that particular garage at Talladega Super Speedway since October of 2019.
Now, NASCAR said in a statement the FBI report concludes and photographic evidence confirms that the garage door pull rope fashioned like a noose had been positioned there since as early as last fall. This was obviously well before the 43 teams arrival and garage assignment. We appreciate the FBI's quick and thorough investigation and thankful to learn that this was not an intentional racist act against Bubba.
Now many on social media reacted to that news calling it a hoax and that angered Wallace who spoke with our Don Lemon last night.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
WALLACE: It was a noose, whether tied to 2019 or whatever, it was a noose. So it wasn't directed at me but somebody tied a noose that's what I'm saying. I'm pissed. I'm mad because people are trying to test my character and the person that I am and my integrity and they are not stealing that away from me but they're just trying to test that.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
SCHOLES: Now, NASCAR President Steve Phelps said they will continue to investigate as to why a rope was fashioned into a noose regardless of when it was done.
All right. Major League Baseball is now officially back. Commissioner Rob Manfred announcing an agreement to play 60 games starting on either July 23rd or 24th. Teams will compete in their home ballparks. Each team's schedule will be mainly divisional games with some games against other teams in their region. Spring training are going to start next week.
I'll tell you what, Laura? We could be in for one funky season. And I'll just give you an example. Sixty games is not a great sample size for baseball. Last season, the Nationals were six games under .500. The third worst team in the National League through 60 games, they won the World Series.
So we could see some really weird things happen this season.
JARRETT: I remember it well. I remember all of the cheers outside of my apartment when it happened.
SCHOLES: Yes.
JARRETT: All right. Andy, good to see you this morning. Thanks so much.
All right. Still ahead, he's 24 years old. He was paralyzed in a car crash. And he's one win away from becoming the youngest member in the history of Congress. Big primary night surprise, next.
[05:16:18]
JARRETT: A primary night surprise in North Carolina. Twenty-four- year-old political newcomer Madison Cawthorn beating the candidate President Trump endorsed, realtor Lynda Bennett. This was a runoff you'll recall for the seat vacated by the president's chief of staff, Mark Meadows. Cawthorn who was partially paralyzed in a car crash will turn 25 years old in August, the minimum age to serve in the House.
Meanwhile, in New York City, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez easily beat challenger Michelle Caruso-Cabrera. The moderate former cable news host accused AOC of forsaking her district for the national spotlight.
Progressives are still looking for a big night in New York. Jamaal Bowman leads 16-term incumbent Eliot Engel. The race has not been called. Only half the voters in. We're also still waiting to see which Kentucky Democrat will take on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Absentee ballots could push results for some races into next week. Voting went relatively smoothly in Kentucky despite a few hiccups, largely avoiding a repeat of the disastrous primaries in Wisconsin and Georgia, that's even though the state dramatically reduced the number of polling places because of coronavirus.
Well, the Biden campaign says it took in $11 million from a Tuesday night fundraiser featuring Joe Biden's former boss Barack Obama. That makes it the financially the most successful event of the campaign so far. Former president struck a hopeful note about his V.P.'s prospect's and he called out President Trump without naming him for, quote, actively promoting division.

JARRETT: Obama said Biden if he wins will inherit a tougher situation than the one he walked into back in 2009 in the midst of the Great Recession.
A big legal victory for Trump's health care policy. A federal court upholding the plan to require hospitals to publicly disclose the secret rates they negotiate with insurers for common tests and procedures. The administration says price transparency will promote competition and reduce health care costs. The hospital group that sued to block the disclosure rule plans to appeal.
Lawmakers are considering another stimulus package to boost the battered U.S. economy. Trillions of dollars have already been seen in bailouts and checks for Americans and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin says the CARES Act is working but a second round of aid will be more targeted.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
STEVE MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY: We're talking about a bunch of different ideas that we may need to do in another bill. And we want to take our time and make sure we're thoughtful. Whatever we do will be much more targeted, much more focused on jobs, bringing back jobs and make being sure we take care of our kids.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
JARRETT: Now, Mnuchin did not give a specific timeline for when another bill could happen. Talk about the next round of stimulus has been increasing. But not everyone is on the same page.
President Trump wants another stimulus check and a payroll cut. Republicans want a liability shield for employers to protect businesses from lawsuits over COVID as they start to re-open. And they want more targeted fiscal aid.
Democrats, meanwhile, are continuing to push for continued enhanced jobless benefits and help for state and the local governments. Wall Street doesn't seem to be hurt by the uncertainty, though. The Nasdaq hit a new record high on Tuesday. It also recorded its eighth day of gains in a row, its longest winning streak since December.
Well, this morning, a deputy to former special counsel Robert Mueller plans to lay out in stunning detail how the case of President Trump's longtime ally Roger Stone was watered down due to political pressure at the highest levels of the Justice Department.

Aaron Zelinsky claims the acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia was pressured to cut stone a break. He will also testify to Congress that Stone was, quote, treated differently from any other defendant because of his relationship to the president. Zelinsky resigned from the case back in February after Attorney General Bill Barr directed a new sentencing recommendation to be submitted for Stone overruling career prosecutors. Just a stunning case from someone still in the Justice Department.
Well, today, Senate Republicans are planning a procedural vote on their police reform bill that's likely to fail. Democrats say the measure is simply not salvageable. They are demanding a bipartisan negotiation ahead of a floor vote.
Senator Cory Booker is the lead sponsor of the Democratic plan.

SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ): We are in a moment of profound possibility but what do we face it being shut down here in the Senate over an impotent bill that fails to meet this moment?

JARRETT: One Republican senator is trying to find some common ground, but he's going to find some resistance. Mike Braun of Indiana plans to propose a bill on qualified immunity. He says it allows people whose rights have been violated to now be able to sue for money damages while also eliminating frivolous lawsuits. Senator Braun will appear on ""NEW DAY"" later this morning.
Well, over to Kentucky where the Louisville police department has fired the officer involved in the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor in March. Officers shot the 26-year-old black EMT eight times after breaking down her door as part of a narcotics investigation. The city's police chief wrote a letter to the detective Brett Hankinson informing he was fired and calling his conduct a shock to the conscience.
CNN has reached out to Hankinson and his attorney for comment. All right. Still ahead, coronavirus in the womb. Doctors are scratching their heads after a healthy mom gives birth to triplets who now have the virus.

JARRETT: The Chinese government now has sites set up across Beijing testing tens of thousands of people for COVID-19 every day. The capital is trying to maintain control over the most recent outbreak there.
CNN's David Culver has a firsthand look.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
DAVID CULVER, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Here in China, you're looking at one of many mass testing sites that have been set up particularly in Beijing. This is following the wholesale food cluster outbreak that happened more than a week ago. They say it's now one control but continuing testing in massive numbers.
And you got here 19 rows set up. This is for 19 different communities that feed into this one massive testing site. Once people have registered, they are taken across this little way here into these lines. And let me show you where they end up. Almost like getting in rides at an amusement park. You're getting in line here, if you will.
I'll show you, follow me over here, and this is where the actual testing is done. It takes about 30 seconds. It got about 100 staff members that work in two hour shifts.
And there they do the throat swab. They then take that sample and they'll put it in a refrigerator, and then move on to the next person. It usually takes just a few days time to get the results back. And most people are only notified if they have a positive result.
You can see over here this is where staff will take off all of their PPE, all of their protective equipment and they'll throw it away. It's kept in a safe separate area.
And the other staff that are about ready to come on shift, they get changed, suited up and go through a sanitation procedure and a separate facility to then keep this going really from 9:00 in the morning until 10:00 at night. In three days time that this has been operating, they've done about 20,000 tests.
This was built overnight. So they pop up relatively quickly. They will keep it going for as long as they need to here within Beijing and say as of now they feel they are on a good path and keeping this most recent cluster outbreak under control. But they are saying complacency is what they are trying to avoid with all of this.

GEORGE Floyd was lovingly remembered as ""Big Floyd"" and ""the ghetto angel"" at his five-hour funeral in Texas yesterday, as his family and civil rights activists vowed to continue to fight racism in his name.
The funeral was at times equal measures of sadness, anger and disbelief as the 46-year-old was remembered and celebrated by family and friends.
A recurring theme of the service was that a man raised in a public-housing project had ""changed the world"".
About a dozen of Mr Floyd's family members, dressed in white, spoke on stage of their memories and their pain at his loss.
Most passionate was his niece, Brooke Williams, who delivered a fiery speech about her uncle in which she declared: ""America, it is time for a change!"" She said her uncle had been the victim of a ""hate crime"".
""Somebody said make America great again. But when has America ever been great?"" the young woman cried.
""That officer showed no remorse for watching my uncle's soul leave his body. He begged and pleaded just for you to get up. But you just pushed harder.
""Why must this system be corrupt and broken? These laws need to be changed. No more hate crimes please. This is not just a murder, but a hate crime."" About 500 people were invited to the funeral in the Fountains of Praise church in Houston, which followed memorial services last week in Minneapolis and Raeford, the North Carolina town where Mr Floyd was born. Celebrity attendees included actors Jamie Foxx and Tatum Channing.
Mourners paid their respects at Mr Floyd's gold-coloured coffin which has now become strongly linked to his memory.
Civil rights leader Reverend Al Sharpton said Mr Floyd's death was not just a tragedy, it was a crime.
""Until these people pay for what they did we will be there with them because lives like George Floyd will not matter until somebody pays the cost for taking their lives.
""We gonna fight on,"" he said as the service closed.
Despite the service being described as ""private"" it was broadcast live on every major US broadcast and cable news channel.
The New York Stock Exchange observed eight minutes and 46 seconds of silence. Following the service, Mr Floyd's body was taken by horse-drawn carriage to a cemetery in suburban Pearland, where he was to be laid to rest next to his mother.

Yosef Aranbayev, 41, who family and neighbors confirm also goes by the name Joe Avianne, raced after the panicked pair in his SUV, firing one shot at them as the men drove away, prosecutors said Monday.
Aranbayev faces attempted murder as a hate crime and other charges for the troubling Saturday night attack.
""I was chasing those guys. ... We're chasing them out of our neighborhood,"" Aranbayev bragged after cops stopped him, prosecutors said. ""I wasn't shooting to kill them - just shooting to scare them.""
But his neighbors and a relative challenged that account of what happened. They said he was protecting his home from a group of shady men who came knocking Saturday, and noted that his Midtown store was robbed by a heist crew last year.
Aranbayev, driving a black Dodge Durango, bore down on the two men at 7:25 p.m. near at the intersection of 73rd Ave. and Parsons Blvd. in Pomonok, prosecutors allege.
The victims were so rattled that they drove their Chevy Tahoe the wrong way down the street to escape him, nearly striking a police car, authorities said. The Tahoe driver pulled alongside the police car, said he and his passenger were being followed, pointed at the Durango - and reported someone inside had shot at them.
Meanwhile, Aranbayev cut through a gas station to avoid a traffic light, but to no avail. Cops quickly caught up with him.
""Those guys were in my neighborhood. I'm sorry, Officer, I didn't do nothing wrong. They were scouting my whole neighborhood the whole day,"" Aranbayev claimed, according to a criminal complaint. ""I'm chasing them. All of us were chasing them. We're chasing them out of our neighborhood,"" he added, the complaint alleges.
He admitted firing the gun, and said his shot ""100% hit their car,"" the complaint alleges.
Aranbayev lives in Jamaica Estates, about 2 miles from the location where he was stopped. Cops found a loaded .357 revolver ditched along the route he was driving. One of the five bullets inside had been fired.
He co-owns Avianne & Co., a store dealing in diamond-encrusted bling with a celebrity clientele, his neighbors confirmed Monday night.
""Hate crime? His wife is black,"" said a woman who identified herself as his brother's wife. ""They have four kids and have been together for over 20 years. He's a jeweler, his clients are black! What they're saying, it's just nonsense. There were two cars. There was two black guys and there was another car with an Israeli gangster. He didn't know what they had in that car.""
On Aug. 25, two thieves robbed his W. 47th St. store at gunpoint, making off with roughly $4 million in swag. The feds arrested Jaysean Sutton and Pablo Davila, in the heist.
Judge Eugene Guarino ordered Aranbayev held on $50,000 bond or $25,000 cash bail at his arraignment in Queens Criminal Court on Sunday night."

Today marks the 22nd anniversary of the death of Matthew Shepard, who was the victim of a fatally violent hate crime because of his sexual orientation. Shepard’s death sparked a movement and a reckoning on LGBTQ hate crimes. His death helped increase support for federal hate crimes legisation to protect the LGBTQ community, leading to the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act which was signed into law in 2009 by the Obama-Biden administration. Human Rights Campaign President Alphonso David issued the following statement:
“22 years later, the legacy and lessons behind the murder of Matthew Shepard are as important as ever. While we have made so much progress on LGBTQ equality, this anniversary is a reminder of just how much we still have to accomplish. Today we mourn anew, for Matthew Shepard, for every victim of LGBTQ bias-motivated violence, and for the record number of violent deaths of transgender people in the United States this year. We must demand better and fight to replace the Trump-Pence administration that has outright ignored the spike in violent hate crimes, rolled back protections for LGBTQ people, and stoked the flames of division.
There is no place for the dehumanizing rhetoric that President Trump and Vice President Pence have permitted. The record number of tragic, violent deaths of transgender people -- particularly Black and Brown transgender women -- show that hateful rhetoric too often leads to horrific real life consequences. In this moment of reckoning, let’s make the United States worthy of Matthew Shepard’s memory by protecting LGBTQ people across this country by enshrining equality into law.”
On Friday, the Human Rights Campaign confirmed the United States has set a new, tragic record of fatal violence against transgender and gender non-conforming people, largely against Black and Brown transgender women, surpassing the record of 31 deaths set in 2017 with a 32nd transgender death confirmed. This makes 2020 the deadliest year on record for transgender people. Despite this, the Trump-Pence administration has not even acknowledged the epidemic of violence."

The particular case was brought by a Catholic diocese, but the issue has raged in New York as Orthodox Jewish congregations have flouted attendance limits with marriages attended by thousands. Perhaps now the Supreme Court will overturn the fine imposed for the assembly illustrated above. The New York limits also have been changed, but the Supreme Court wanted to send a message and it was clear. Religion trumps public health. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who had been the court's pivotal member in previous emergency applications seeking relief from virus-related restrictions, dissented along with the court's three liberal members. He noted that while the court was considering the petitions, Cuomo, a Democrat, had eased the restrictions, and thus there was no need for the court to intervene now. 'It is a significant matter to override determinations made by public health officials concerning what is necessary for public safety in the midst of a deadly pandemic,' Roberts wrote for himself. But the court's more conservative justices said it violated the Constitution for local officials to impose more drastic restrictions on houses of worship than on businesses considered essential.Related: This new court majority will soon be ruling in any number of ways that religious beliefs of one sort MAY impinge on the religious beliefs of others. Think women's medical rights; gay rights; access to contraceptives; employment, housing and public accommodation; treatment of prisoners; treatment of people with religious beliefs disfavored by the majority; hate crime laws, and more. Example: Leading Arkansas homophobe Jerry Cox will be happy to tell you how imposing penalties for hate-motivated crimes against LGBT people violates his religious freedom. Should Arkansas miraculously pass such a law, he'll find a sympathetic ear on this Supreme Court.

For a party that has embraced nonracialism, the DA is now flirting with the trope of the white farmer as a particular type of victim of violence in SA
On May 1 2012, I was walking between 6th and 8th avenues in New York, on my way to a meeting at The New York Times. Some hard rain had left the humidity at 88%, and everything felt steamy and uncertain.
Standing outside one of those typical neighbourhood greengrocers that dot the city, dressed in a frayed coat with the blackness bleached out of it, in scuffed high heels and layers of frothy skirts and carrying a handbag heavy with tired gold embroidery, was an old woman shouting imprecations at passersby.
As I shuffled past, she said to me, angrily: & I'm not a Jewish woman! I'm a human being.& For some reason, this encounter has haunted me. I've got no idea what trail of sadness and toil led her to this dirty sidewalk, or why she felt the need to deny one identity and assert another, but I thought of her again this week when I read about the DA's new(ish) self-definition as & a liberal party committed to nonracialism, a market economy, and a capable state& I thought about her, not because the DA is the political party equivalent of a disturbed person standing on a street corner shouting & the end is nigh& though sometimes it does fit that description - but because one of the resolutions the party adopted at its recent elective congress is, according to The Citizen, & to push for the government to declare farm murders a hate crime and priority crime with harsher sentences if prosecutors prove the intent was hatred, based on the victim's identity as a farmer& The proposal, submitted by MP Dianne Kohler Barnard, received 91.38% approval. The question that wasn't addressed, though, is what is an & identity as a farmer& Kohler Barnard, it must be said, is not the ideal person to answer this question. The hard-tweeting MP was the subject of a recent Africa Check debunking, when her claim that SA is down & from 120,000 commercial farmers ... to 38,000& due to & the recent scourge of farm attacks and murders of farmers and farmworkers& was found to be & misleading& According to Africa Check, her & claim cites [an] unsubstantiated 1994 figure and misrepresents official data& In effect, where Stats SA's 2017 census of commercial agriculture referred to & farming units& Kohler Barnard chose to understand this to mean & farmers& and & as experts have explained, the census does not [actually] contain data on the number of farmers& It's an interesting aperçu. Why does the DA need us to believe there is such a thing as an & identity as a farmer& as opposed to it being a job description, and at the same time insist that it is concerned about all murders that occur on farms?
How come the DA claims it can't see race, but if it squints a little, it can easily make out farmers from the general mass of victims of violence in SA? And how does the DA intend to define & farmer& One assumes that the party of Helen Zille, that Smiter of Wokeness, isn't going to let people self-identify.
In her two-minute presentation, Kohler Barnard said: & The [police] plan has failed and farmers, black and white, their wives, children and parents are four times more likely to be killed than the average South African.& She also said that & in the last 10 years, 612 farmers and farmworkers have been murdered and 2,818 have been attacked, maimed, raped, crippled or blinded& But for some reason - and I think we all know what that is - the DA insists that murdering a farmworker and murdering a farmer are different things, with the latter also capable of being a hate crime. But, wait: if a black farmer is killed, is that a hate crime? Or is it only white farmers? What, to the DA, is an & identity as a farmer& This is not to suggest that the murder of a farmer can't be a hate crime, or that there aren't reasons for different levels of violence inflicted because of a victim's gender, race or economic standing. What I'm interested in is why the Freedom Front Minus - that party formerly known as the DA - needs to be able, in this particular instance, to signal to a part of its constituency that it can, in fact, see race?
I imagine a local version of my New York encounter, where the person is muttering: & I'm not a farmer! I'm a human being.& The woman I walked past in 2012 was signalling, perhaps, that the identity she'd been assigned by society, among other instruments, singled her out for treatment outside of the general definition of humanity, and perhaps to someone else's benefit.
In the same way, the DA's flirtation with the political trope of the white farmer as a particular type of victim, no matter to what degree that trope is justified or not, is yet another indication of the aporia at the heart of its own identity. A party that wants to be seen as adopting nonracialism, & the rejection of race as a way to categorise and treat people& as it said in September, is risking, again, what its newly crowned leader described as & looking for populist shortcuts& Caption"

In his Friday briefing, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo introduced the Say Their Name, reform aimed at curtailing race-based violent policing the wake of George Floyd s death after an officer s nearly nine-minute chokehold led to his death.
KEY FACTS
Thelegislationhas four cornerstones: 1. Transparency of prior disciplinary records. 2. No chokeholds. 3. False race-based 911 report should be classified as a hate crime 4. The attorney general should act as an independent prosecutor for police murders.
Cuomo said that New York should lead the way for police reform and urged the legislature to pass the bill into law next week.
This comes after avideosurfaced on social media of what appears to be police officers throwing an older man to the street then leaving him to bleed on the ground in Buffalo, New York. 
 That video disturbs your basic sense of humanity and decency, said Cuomo in the briefing. An older gentleman where was the threat then you just walk by when you see blood coming from his head. 
He said the agenda comes from the long list of names who we have seen who have been abused by police officers, by the criminal justice system and Mr. Floyd is just the last name on the very long list. 
Tangent
In the same briefing, Cuomo announced that the New York Covid-19 death toll hit an eight-week low with 42 deaths on Thursday and the lowest total hospitalizations to date. 
Key Background
Today marks the 10th day of protests over the killing of the unarmed black man George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Yesterday New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio took the stage at a memorial service for George Floyd to jeers and calls for his resignation after footage on Twitter went viral of the NYPD attempting to arrest a journalist and cuffinga food delivery person an essential worker for violation of the city s 8pm curfew.

For the month of June 2020, the number of people victimized by gun violence and murder in New York City spiked significantly, when compared to the same period in 2019. Between June 1 and June 30, there was a 130% increase in the number of shooting incidents across the city (205 v. 89) as the number of shootings rose in every borough of New York. The number of people murdered citywide increased to 39 v. 30, (+ 30%) for the month, while the number of burglaries increased to 1,783 v. 817 (+118%) and the number of auto thefts increased to 696 v. 462 (+51%) citywide.
While the NYPD has made approximately 40,000 fewer overall arrests so far this year compared with last year, gun arrests year-to-date as of July 5 are 1,679 vs. 1,683. We have also seen the impacts of legislative mandates sending offenders no longer eligible for bail back to the streets where they are being regularly rearrested and contributing to overall crime in the city.
Every day our officers are taking innovative actions to meet the challenges of policing in a during the COVID-19 pandemic. They respond in real-time to crime spikes by gathering timely intelligence, analyzing crime trends and disseminating preventative measures to ensure safety for all.
""The sharp increase in shootings and violence in New York puts innocent people at risk and tears at the fabric of life in our city,"" said NYPD Police Commissioner Dermot Shea. ""The challenges are great for an NYPD facing the strain of deep budget cuts, changes to the criminal justice system that are impacting the courts and the continuing international health pandemic. But through it all, I have seen our hardworking men and women display an unwavering commitment to the kind of fair and effective policing that defines our agency and that New Yorkers expect and deserve.""
Increase in Shootings: New York City has seen an increase in gunfire in the last month - measured in the number of separate shooting incidents occurring across the city, and, more concerning, in the number of victims injured and killed. Every injury from a bullet can be a millimeter away from being a death. For the first weeks of June, the number of shootings in the city more than doubled compared to the same period a year ago. Through June 30, overall shootings citywide rose to 205 - with 270 victims. Currently, the number of parolees involved in shooting incidents or murders is at a 15-year high. Meanwhile, from January through the end of June, more than 2,000 people arrested in a crime with a gun recovered had cases against them that remain open in the courts.
Ongoing Challenges: The NYPD is enduring a round of deep budget cuts that have led to a class of 1,163 recruits being canceled. The department has also seen an increase in retirements. The NYPD's facilitation of peaceful protest continues to utilize department resources. While the NYPD uses a lighter touch in regard to enforcement, offenders no longer eligible for bail are being rearrested: they have been rearrested for approximately 750 additional major felonies through June 26, compared with the population of those released in the same period a year ago.
Last month, Commissioner Shea announced a series of personnel changes to positon the department for the 21st Century policing by continuing to strengthen the bonds between officers and residents. He promoted Jeffrey B. Maddrey, the longtime chief of the NYPD's Patrol Borough Brooklyn North, to the position of Chief of Community Affairs, at a moment of historic importance in the relationship between the police and the public. Other appointments the commissioner made will allow seasoned NYPD leaders to see the city and the residents we serve through these challenging times.
Key highlights from this month's crime statistics:
* Murder is up +23.1% (181 v. 147) for the first six months of 2020 when compared to the first six months of 2019.
* There were 205 citywide shooting incidents in June 2020, compared to 89 shooting incidents in June 2019, a 130.3% increase. Year-to-date, through June 30, there is a +46% spike in citywide shooting incidents (528 v. 362).
* Burglary increased +118.2% (1,783 v. 817) in June and is up +46.3% (7,234 v. 4,943) year-to-date through June 30.
* For the month of June, rape decreased by -21% (109 v. 138). Rape continues to be underreported. If you have been a victim of sexual assault, please come forward. The NYPD Special Victims Division's 24-hour hotline is 212-267-RAPE (7273).
* Year-to-date, through June 28, citywide hate crimes declined -38% (134 v. 212).

In the state House, legislators have moved on to another aspect of the Ahmaud Arbery killing: citizen's arrest.
Arbery was shot in the Satilla Shores neighborhood of Glynn County in February, kicking off weeks of protest and unrest across the nation that continue today.
On Monday, state Rep. Jeff Jones, R-St. Simons Island, announced plans to introduce the Citizens Detainment Act.
Unlike another bill being authored by state Rep. Carl Gilliard, D-Garden City, and supported by Rep. Don Hogan, R-St. Simons Island, Jones' bill would not directly repeal citizen's arrest. Instead, it would build upon and clarify the boundaries of the authority it grants.
Georgia's current citizen's arrest law reads: ""A private person may arrest an offender if the offense is committed in his presence or within his immediate knowledge. If the offense is a felony and the offender is escaping or attempting to escape, a private person may arrest him upon reasonable and probable grounds of suspicion.""
Waycross Judicial Circuit District Attorney George Barnhill cited the law in a letter advising the Glynn County Police Department that he saw insufficient cause to arrest Gregory McMichael, 64, and his son, Travis McMichael, 34. Both men have since been arrested and charged with felony murder in the shooting death of Arbery.
Looking to expand upon that, Jones' offering would draw a distinction between ""arrest"" and ""detainment,"" allowing citizens to detain another citizen only when directly witnessing a person commit a crime.
In a statement Monday, Jones clarified that ""if a private citizen sees a flash of flames through the windows of a neighbor's house and the citizen sees a person whom they do not recognize run out the front door with a gas can, the citizen would probably be justified.""
""Such detention would be allowed until the circumstances could be figured out and until law enforcement could be summoned and arrive on scene to take charge,"" Jones' statement reads. ""While the citizen did not see the arson, they had a pretty good idea that it happened. This is what is meant by 'immediate knowledge.'""
The act would also prohibit the use of deadly force except to stop the detainee from harming another person or committing a forcible felony, which ""involves the use or threat of physical force or violence against any person,"" the statement reads.
""We do not want anyone to be harmed, injured or killed for suspected theft of a piece of personal property,"" Jones said in the statement.
The law would also provide for resistance to unlawful detainment.
""While our civil society does not encourage a self-defense shootout, a private citizen has the right to protect and defend themselves if someone is attempting to detain them illegally, with force,"" Jones stated.
Jones plans to introduce the bill this week during the General Assembly's shortened session.
Like the bill authored by Gilliard, Jones said the Citizens Detainment Act was spurred by the Arbery shooting.
Jones could not immediately be reached for comment Monday.
During a Monday morning state Senate hearing, Sen. Lester Jackson, D-Savannah, invoked the names of Arbery, Rayshard Brooks, allegedly killed by police in Atlanta on Friday, and George Floyd, also allegedly killed by police in Minneapolis on May 25.
He hoped his address would get the ball rolling on House Bill 426, a hate crimes bill that would, among other things, allow judges to issue harsher sentences for a crime under certain conditions.
The state House passed the bill in March 2019, and it has gone without a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee since, he said.
""The blinders are off,"" Jackson told his colleagues. ""We know in Brunswick, Ga., hate crime exists. We know in Atlanta, Ga., we know in Minnesota, we know in New York, hate crime exists. We can't do anything about New York or Minnesota, but we can do something about Georgia.""
In a past interview with The News, Sen. William Ligon, R-White Oak, said Sen. Jesse Stone, R-Waynesboro and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, is working on his own hate crime legislation.
While he didn't know exactly what it entailed, Ligon said he'd like to see legislation that left the decision of whether or not to legally designate a crime as hate-motivated to judges.
Both houses of the General Assembly will be meeting this week to conclude the current legislative session, which was suspended in March due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

Garcia",NA,"Two Arrested in Killings of Transgender Women in Puerto Rico",FALSE,"The police said they had classified the deaths as a hate crime after the remains of two women were found in a badly burned car last week.
A week after the bodies of two transgender women were found in a badly burned car in Puerto Rico, the police said Thursday that they had arrested two men in connection with the killings and had turned them over to the F.B.I.
The men, Juan Carlos Pagán Bonilla, 21, and Sean Díaz de León, 19, were taken into custody on Wednesday but have not been charged, according to Capt. Teddy Morales, the chief of criminal investigations for the police in Humacao, on Puerto Rico’s eastern coast, where the women’s remains were found on April 22.
He said the F.B.I. had taken over the case and was investigating Mr. Pagán Bonilla and Mr. Díaz de León for possible civil rights violations.
“We are classifying it as a hate crime because they were socializing with the victims, and once they found out they were transgender women, they decided to kill them,” Captain Morales said on Thursday.
The police said they were waiting for autopsy results to determine how the women had been killed. Activists have identified the women as Layla Peláez, 21, and Serena Angelique Velázquez, 32, two friends who lived in New York City. Their remains were found after a person called 911 to report a burned car under a bridge on a desolate road in Humacao, just before 5 a.m. on April 22, Captain Morales said.
Mr. Pagán Bonilla and Mr. Díaz de León had been socializing with Ms. Velázquez and Ms. Peláez on the night before they were killed and were recorded on one of the women’s social media accounts, Captain Morales said.
He said the police had also tied Mr. Pagán Bonilla and Mr. Díaz de León to the killings through security camera footage and “scientific evidence,” which he declined to detail. Mr. Pagán Bonilla confessed to participating in the killings, and Mr. Díaz de León turned himself in, he said.
Limary Cruz-Rubio, a spokeswoman for the F.B.I.’s San Juan field office, declined to discuss the arrests but said the bureau routinely collaborates with local, state and federal agencies.
“The Bureau is and will always be interested in criminal conduct which may fall within federal jurisdiction,” she said. “However, our policy is we do not confirm or deny the existence of investigations, to protect the integrity of any possible investigative effort.”
Mr. Pagán Bonilla and Mr. Díaz de León could not immediately be reached for comment on Thursday night, and it was not immediately clear if they had lawyers.
If the men are charged, it could represent a turning point in the handling of crimes against L.G.B.T.Q. people in Puerto Rico, which has a disturbing history of violence against gay and transgender people, activists said.
Ms. Velázquez and Ms. Peláez were the third and fourth transgender people killed in Puerto Rico in the last two months, activists said. They were also believed to be the seventh and eighth transgender or gender-nonconforming people to have been killed in the United States this year, according to the Human Rights Campaign.
In the past 15 months, 10 L.G.B.T.Q. people have been killed in Puerto Rico, according to Pedro Julio Serrano, a gay rights activist. All but three of the deaths remain unsolved, he said.
“These arrests are a step in the right direction, but these murders have to be prosecuted as hate crimes,” Mr. Serrano said. “We urge the government to finish the investigations in the other seven murders of L.G.B.T.Q. people on the island and serve justice for all of them.”
Ms. Velázquez lived in Queens and Ms. Peláez in the Bronx. Both had recently traveled to Puerto Rico, and they were planning to fly back to New York later this month, according to family members and activists.
Luz Melendez, 29, Ms. Peláez’s cousin, said Mr. Pagán Bonilla and Mr. Díaz de León were arrested after a local radio station posted images of them on Facebook and people began to call the station to identify them.
“We are super appreciative of the work that the officials and the community put in to find who did this,” she said on Thursday.
She said the images came from two videos that Ms. Peláez had posted on her Snapchat and Facebook accounts, which showed her and Ms. Velázquez socializing with Mr. Pagán Bonilla and Mr. Díaz de León.
“I saw the videos, and it seemed like they were spending time together as friends,” she said. “It seemed normal. There was music playing in the background. Everyone seemed fine.”
She said the police had told her family only that the men were in federal custody.
The killings came a month after Yampi Méndez Arocho, a 19-year-old transgender man, was killed in Moca, P.R., according to the Human Rights Campaign.
In February, Alexa Negrón Luciano, a well-known figure on Puerto Rico social media who was transgender and homeless, was shot to death after a McDonald’s customer complained that Ms. Negrón had spied on her in the women’s room.
Ms. Negrón’s final moments — framed in the headlights of a car amid a cackle of laughter — were posted on social media, a fact that activists said underscored the impunity homophobic attackers feel when committing such crimes.

Not now I have a bodyguard",FALSE,"Wearing a radio earpiece but no mask, my bodyguard greets me at Penn station, Manhattan, with an outstretched hand and I am too English to offer him my elbow instead. Stocky Patrick McCall carries a gun, is trained in krav maga - a fighting technique developed by the Israel Defence Forces - and has spent his career in the security industry.
He claims to be 6ft, which is curious because he seems to be shorter than me and I am 5ft 8in. Not that size matters.
In the past, McCall, 36, looked after the wealthy. Now, nervous New Yorkers of middling means are hiring security guards to escort them in their daily lives. I was intrigued to try the service myself.
It seems extreme, but the Big Apple feels rattled after Covid-19 devastation (24,000 deaths so far), anti-police riots, polling chaos, and a rise in violence.
The idea that ""New York is over"", as one heiress has told me, is ludicrous, but these days everyone has a nightmare to share. ""New Yorkers used to need a shrink and meds; now it's a shrink, meds and a bodyguard,"" said a colleague.
McCall tells me his after-dark jobs include escorting groups of female friends on nights out, while looking after ""average Joes"" has increased 80% in a year. ""It's everybody from corporate executives to tourists to housewives who want to go out and do some shopping ADAM NADEL but they're afraid,"" said McCall. The hourly rate is $50 ((EURO)42) and you can specify your bodyguard: plainclothes or suited, male or female, imposing physique or someone who will blend in. Male clients will often request female security: ""Some guys are embarrassed - they're in pretty good shape and feel emasculated, so ask us to tone it down and send someone who's not intrusive.""
Many customers simply want to be chaperoned on their commute. Pasquale Cosenzo, a programmer, is accompanied by one of McCall's agents for his walk from Penn station. ""I can't risk my safety or my family's safety because I argue with some guy who's on drugs or mentally ill,"" said Cosenzo, 48.
McCall recalled an incident near Penn station last weekend in which an ""emotionally disturbed person"" stabbed someone several times. ""Our client saw it, froze. We had to physically move him.""
Official figures say murders are up 37% on 2019, and shootings have more than doubled. But robbery, assault and hate crimes are down. Criminologists dismiss claims that New York is slipping back into being a crime-ridden hellhole. ""Total crime is down 82% from 1990,"" said Christopher Herrmann, of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. ""This isn't a numbers thing - it's a perception thing.""
McCall provides reassurance. ""We give clients peace of mind,"" he said. @LFPullman

ANNOUNCER: This is NEW DAY with Alisyn Camerota and John Berman.
JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome to our viewers in the United States and all around the world. This is NEW DAY. It's Wednesday, June 24. It's 6 a.m. here in New York.
And this morning, the coronavirus pandemic in the United States is breaking records. And Dr. Anthony Fauci says the next two weeks are critical in saving lives.
As of this morning, 26 states, those states in red, are reporting an increase in new cases. That's more than half the country showing an increase. Seven states are reporting a record number of hospitalizations, including Texas, where the Republican governor there is now urging residents to stay home. That's a huge reversal there. The European Union, which has been far more successful in containing the virus, is now considering banning Americans from traveling there.
The U.S. now makes up about 25 percent of the total cases in the world. A 25 percent and 25 percent of deaths, but the U.S. makes up only 4 percent of the world's population.
ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR; Despite all of that, President Trump held a large indoor rally in Arizona, one of the nation's coronavirus hot spots, where he again used a racist and juvenile nickname to describe the virus.
Many in the rally did not wear masks or keep socially distant. We'll show you some more video from that. This is exactly the type of gathering that the White House coronavirus task force warns against.
The nation's top health officials say they see a disturbing surge that is not under control.
So let's begin our coverage with CNN's Lucy Kafanov. She is live in Dallas -- Lucy.
LUCY KAFANOV, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Alisyn, good morning.
Coronavirus cases are surging here in Texas. We've seen a record spike in this state. And as you pointed out in the intro, this is just one of 26 states with increasing numbers. Many are breaking records. The nation's top health officials ringing the alarm. The president ignoring those warnings.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
KAFANOV (voice-over): On Capitol Hill, an urgent warning from the nation's top infectious disease doctor as President Trump campaigned on the other side of the country in Arizona, one of the states experiencing a rapid increase in reported coronavirus cases.
FAUCI: We're now seeing a disturbing surge of infections.
The next couple of weeks are going to be critical in our ability to address those surgings that we're seeing.
KAFANOV: New weekly infections are on the rise in at least 26 states, including California, recording 5,000 new cases, its highest daily count since the start of the pandemic.
Here in Texas, one of the first states to begin reopening, Governor Greg Abbott now says it's possible restrictions will be back.
Because the spread is so rampant right now, there's never a reason for you to have to leave your home, unless you do need to go out. The safest place for you is at your home.
KAFANOV: There's no statewide mandate for wearing masks in Texas, nor is there in Florida, where Governor Ron DeSantis is still resisting issuing one. GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): Catch more flies with honey than vinegar. And you attach criminal penalties for something, you've got to enforce it. And the question is, in some of the parts of Florida, is that really a good use of resources?
KAFANOV: A county face mask rule was not enforced at Trump's indoor event at an Arizona as the state reported a new single-day record of cases at nearly 3,600. Dr. Anthony Fauci giving this advice to help slow the spread.
FAUCI: Plan A, don't go in a crowd. Plan B, if you do, make sure you wear a mask.
KAFANOV: Fauci, along with other top health officials, testifying before a House committee about the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus.
DR. ROBERT REDFIELD, DIRECTOR, CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL: We've all done the best that we can do to tackle this virus and the reality that brought this nation to its knees.
KAFANOV: And shutting down this claim from President Trump last week.
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: o I said to my people, Slow the testing down, please.
KAFANOV: Trump's staff said he was kidding, but according to the president --
TRUMP: I don't kid. By having more cases, it sounds bad, but actually, what it is is, we're finding people.
KAFANOV: Fauci telling lawmakers he was unaware of any delays.
FAUCI: To my knowledge, none of us have ever been told to slow down on testing. That just is a fact. In fact, we will be doing more testing.
KAFANOV: And on the question of a possible vaccine --
FAUCI: I still think there is a reasonably good chance that, by the very beginning of 2021, that if we're going to have a vaccine, that we will have it by then.

KAFANOV: Health officials say the recent spike is being fueled by people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s.
A big issue, Alisyn, is large gatherings. Here in Texas, governor trying to restrict that, giving local judges, county judges and mayors the ability to restrict gatherings, outdoor gatherings of 100 people -- Alisyn.
CAMEROTA: Lucy Kafanov in Dallas for us. Thank you very much.
Developing overnight, Bubba Wallace, the only black driver on the NASCAR circuit, is talking to CNN after the FBI determined he was not the target of a hate crime. Investigators say the noose found in his garage stall had been there since last Fall.
CNN's Nick Valencia joins us now with more.
This is a relief, I'm sure, on -- on one side, but still lots of questions about it -- Nick.
NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Alisyn.
Yes, to use Bubba Wallace's own words, he says that he's pissed that some members of the public are questioning his integrity, some going so far as to say that he's manufactured a hoax.
Here's part of what he said in his interview last night with CNN's Don Lemon.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BUBBA WALLACE, NASCAR DRIVER: I'm pissed. I'm mad, because people are trying to test my character and the person that I am and my integrity. And they're not stealing that away from me, but they're just trying to test that.
The image that I have and I have seen of what was hanging in my garage is not a -- is not a garage pull. I've -- I've been racing all my life. We've raced out of hundreds of garages that never had garage pulls like that.
It was a noose that was -- whether it was tied in 2019 or whatever, it was a noose. So if it wasn't directed at me, but somebody tied a noose. That's what I'm saying. It was -- it is a noose.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
VALENCIA: Wallace was clear in his interview last night, saying that he never saw the noose. It was a member of his team. And his statement about a hate crime only came after he was told by the president of NASCAR that he was the victim of a hate crime.
Now, we want to show you some new video or some video, I should say, this morning of 2019, showing garage number 4 where this noose was found and this noose being there last year in 2019.
Now, we should mention that the Department of Justice and FBI concluded that no hate crime occurred. They released a statement here. I want to read part of that.
It said, ""The noose found in garage No. 4 was in that garage as early as October 2019. Although the noose is now known to have been in garage No. 4 in 2019, nobody could have known Mr. Wallace would be assigned to garage No. 4 last week.""
Now, NASCAR has been accused by critics of jumping the gun, coming out too soon with a statement in this hyper-charged environment. They're also talking, saying that they're committed to an inclusive environment in their sport -- Alisyn.
CAMEROTA: That -- that video is fascinating. That is a noose.
VALENCIA: Yes.
CAMEROTA: It will be interesting for the rest of us to see what it normally looks like and to hear Bubba Wallace in a couple of hours on our program.
Nick, thank you very much.
Because coming up on NEW DAY, John Berman will speak with NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace live in our 8 a.m. hour. Stick around for that.
BERMAN: All right. Developing overnight, protests in Madison, Wisconsin, the state capital there. Video shows Democratic State Senator Tim Carpenter allegedly being attacked by at least two people who rushed towards the camera.
Carpenter told ""The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel,"" quote, ""I don't know what happened. All I did was stop and take a picture, and the next thing I know I'm getting five, six punches, getting kicked in the head.""
The group of protesters took down two statues outside the Capitol building in Madison, including one of an abolitionist who died trying to end slavery during the Civil War.
The unrest began earlier in the day in response to the arrest of a black man who brought a megaphone and a baseball bat into a restaurant.
This morning, the governor of Texas is telling people to stay home. That is a huge reversal there. And one of the nation's leading public health experts who lives in Texas calls what is happening now the greatest public health failure in the history of the nation. He joins us next.
[06:13:00]
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GOV. GREG ABBOTT (R-TX): The coronavirus is serious. It's spreading in Brazos County, across the entire state of Texas.
Because the spread is so rampant right now, there's never a reason for you to have to leave your home, unless you do need to go out. The safest place for you is at your home.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BERMAN: That's Texas Governor Greg Abbott telling people to stay home as the coronavirus rapidly spreads across his state. That's a big reversal in Texas with the governor telling people to stay home. On Tuesday, Texas reported more than 5,000 new cases, breaking the previous record. The state is also reporting a record number of hospitalizations. You can see the increase there.
Joining us now is Dr. Peter Hotez. He's the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.
So Dr. Hotez, you're in the middle of it all. And I know it's hard to hear these types of things in the morning, but let me just tell people some of the things you have said over the last 24 hours about what's happening. You've called this the greatest public health failure in the history of the nation. You've said the situation in Texas is lights out. You call it a disaster. And you say you don't have two weeks to fix this. Why such alarm?
DR. PETER HOTEZ, DEAN, NATIONAL SCHOOL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE, BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE: Yes, thanks for having me.
We're seeing a very steep acceleration now in the number of cases here in Houston, in our metro areas, as you pointed out, and also in San Antonio and Austin. It's just -- not just an increase in the number of cases. It's the slope, the way it's accelerating. It's almost vertical. This is what we call an exponential rise, meaning it's been flat for a while, and now it's going up almost vertically.
And so the numbers are quite concerning in terms of the number of cases. But in some ways, that's the least of it, because our hospitalizations. Texas Medical Center, which is the world's largest medical center, with 60 institutions, we are now projecting that our intensive care units will fill up over the next two weeks.
And the reason that's significant is because we know, as ICUs start to fill up, mortality goes up. It gets harder and harder to manage all of those patients. Even if you have -- even if you're fully staffed.
[06:15:09]
So this is when you see mortality rates really start to accelerate. This is what we saw in Lombardi, Italy. This is what we saw in Elmhurst hospital in New York and elsewhere in New York. And this is what we can expect here in our Texas hospitals.
So the point is, that's the two-week projection now. Because things are so dire, we have to intervene now, and we have to be very aggressive at implementing stay-at-home and other social distancing measures.
CAMEROTA: Let's talk about that intervention, because you say that we're in a red-alert situation in Texas. And so the intervention is going to go well beyond masks. So what has to happen today?
HOTEZ: Well, that's the point: we're not really at red alert yet. We do have a color-coded system here in Harris County in Houston of green, yellow, orange and red. We're still at orange. I think we have to go to red at this point. We've seen enough. We know the ICUs are filling up. This is not some artifact or -- or a result of increased testing as some like to allege.
So unfortunately, we're going to have to go back to a pretty aggressive program of social distancing. Exactly what we cut -- cut back, I think that's going to have to be decided between the governor and the county executives and -- and the mayors --
CAMEROTA: But if it were up to you, Dr. Hotez --
HOTEZ: -- but it's -- the odds are they're not going to do it.
CAMEROTA: I hear you, but if they were taking advice from you, what would that intervention be?
HOTEZ: What -- if it were up to me, we would do exactly what we did towards the end of March, which is a full -- implement a full lockdown and social distancing. That's the only way that I see that we're going to start to bring those numbers down.
And then this time, we have to go back to what's called containment mode, meaning less than one new case per million residents per day.
Remember, if -- back when we opened up in early April, I was on; and I explained that the modelers were telling us that we had to keep social distancing aggressively in place all the way through the month of May to get to that containment point. And we weren't prepared to do it.
And what's more, not only did we open up prematurely, we didn't put the belts and suspenders in needed to monitor that opening. I other words, we didn't have an adequate health system in place for all the contact tracing. We never really did what I call syndromic surveillance in a big way, meaning an app-based system to monitor increase in cases and respiratory illnesses and fever.
We never even had epidemiological models to have as a road map. We didn't have the regular communications.
So all of this catastrophe that we're seeing right now is both predicted and predictable. And now, unfortunately, we're going to have to go back, double down, and then start again.
BERMAN: I have to say, Dr. Hotez, you know, it's not up to you. You can't just institute the stay-at-home order now. So I do wonder, given that Greg Abbott, who urged people to stay at home, which is vastly different than instituting a stay-at-home order, I wonder how politically feasible it is at this point.
It seems to me it's very hard to start reinstituting some of these things politically. You know, Texas -- I mean, in Arizona yesterday, which is seeing largely the same thing that you're seeing in Texas right now, the president held, basically, a rally in a room packed with 3,000 people, and only a few of them were wearing masks.
HOTEZ: Yes, and to make things more difficult, what we have here in Texas is kind of a fringe element coming from the far right. This is an antivaccine movement that is now embraced -- under the moniker of what they call health freedom. They've now added that they're going to campaign against contact tracing, against social distancing, against masks.
And of course, I'm the No. 1 target. They call me the original gangster villain, the O.G. villain. And so that's -- that's an extra problem.
But look, the governor, together with the county executives and the mayors, do have some options. For instance, we can focus right now on the metro areas. At least, that's where the cases seem to be accelerating the most. Let's -- let's start there and -- and then maybe the rest of the state will follow.
But at least we've got to do something to save lives at this point. This is a dire situation. And as I said, otherwise, the ICU cases will start to mount.
CAMEROTA: Dr. Peter Hotez, we really appreciate you sounding the alarm here, as you always have, and we appreciate all of the information you're giving us this morning.
HOTEZ: Thanks so much.
BERMAN: So, the president of the United States goes full racist with his language on Saturday night and on Tuesday night. So how do you explain someone using a pattern of racist language like that? And what will the impact be on the November election? There's some brand-new polling out that the president may want to see. That's next.

TRUMP: It's got all different names. Wuhan. Wuhan was catching on. Coronavirus, right?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Kung Flu!
TRUMP: Kung Flu, yes. Kung Flu.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CAMEROTA: And the crowd goes wild. President Trump continuing to use what we assume is his favorite racist term to describe coronavirus.
Back in March, President Trump's senior adviser, Kellyanne Conway, condemned the use of that term and demanded that reporters tell her who in the White House was using it.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO DONALD TRUMP: I'm not dealing in hypotheticals. Of course it's wrong.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Of course it's wrong.
CONWAY: But you can't just make an accusation and not tell us who it is. Who is it? And that's highly offensive so you should tell us all who it is.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CAMEROTA: OK. Joining us now is CNN political commentators Mitch Landrieu and Errol louis.
Well, I guess we can tell Kellyanne Conway, Errol, that it's the president who continues to use it. What's the play here? He thinks that his -- he thinks he can win with a racist term?
[06:25:01]
ERROL LOUIS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: You know, unfortunately, Alisyn, he has reason to think so, because it -- he's done it many, many, many times before, and it got him the presidency, frankly.
You know, we should never forget that it was the racist birther conspiracy that he sort of latched onto that really brought him to national prominence in the political realm.
And he's never given that up. He comes back to it again and again and again. It's kind of his main sounding board for getting back into the rhythm that he thinks is going to take him to victory.
Now, the country has changed. It has changed substantially, just in the last few weeks. I don't know if the president realizes that his strategy is badly at odds with where people seem to be, including young people.
You know, somebody has been marching in the streets every night for the last 25 or so nights. He might want to talk to some of his advisers about who those people are and how turned off they are by some of his rhetoric.
BERMAN: Literally sweating to the oldies there as he was delivering that racist term.
And it's not just the use of that term. Of course, Alisyn talked a lot yesterday about the fact that he was retweeting without explanation or context or any reason a picture of a black person punching a white person.
This is something he is clearly leaning into, and it's a choice.
To Errol's point, though, Mayor Landrieu, the country is different. There's a new ""New York Times"" poll out minutes ago. We'll talk about the overall margin, which is enormous right now, between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. But the numbers on the president's handling of racial tensions are of particular note, given the context of the discussion we're having right now. This is P-305.
The president is doing badly, even with conservatives, on handling of race. Somewhat conservative voters, 46 percent disapprove -- disapprove -- of the president's handling of racial justice protests. Seventy percent of moderate voters disapprove.
So maybe this worked before for him, but there's a lot of reason to believe it's not working now.
MITCH LANDRIEU, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, as Errol said, this is something that was seen in the United States of America when we're at our lowest point. Whether it's Bull Connor, whether it's George Wallace, whether it was Nixon's southern strategy, it was clear. It was intentional. It was focused on keeping us separated, dividing and conquering.
And unfortunately, this president of the United States, every chance he's gotten, has led us in the wrong direction, done the wrong thing, and instead of uniting us around the very serious issues that we're facing, COVID-19, the economic crisis, the really critical issues we're having around police reform. When the country needs a uniter, the president has intentionally gone after the lowest common denominator. It is very sad to watch.
But there is great evidence that the people of America are not going buy this again. At the end of the day, though, it's up to us. We have to go to the polls. Although he has abused his power every day, we now have the power to take our country back. And my expectation is that we are going to do that.
CAMEROTA: Well, unknowable. I mean, Mayor, that therein lies the rub, right? That if, as Errol says, you know, all these people -- all these young people who are turning out to march, do they march themselves into a polling place? We don't know until election day.
But one predictor, Errol, that is an interesting possible harbinger is the fundraising that Joe Biden has now seen. So in May, his numbers eclipsed -- well, beat President Trump's. Let me put them up.
Joe Biden in May raised 80.8 -- $80.8 million. President Trump raised $74 million. I mean, obviously, these numbers are astronomical. But I think that this is the first time that Biden is seen as, you know, a real winner in this category.
LOUIS: No, that's right. And listen, the president called him a sleepy guy in a basement. That's pretty good for a sleepy guy in a basement. He just had a huge fundraiser that was headlined, sort of socially distant, an online fundraiser by former President Obama. And again, raised a tremendous amount of money in a very short time.
And so, you know, each of the things that the Trump campaign had touted as their key to success -- their enormous popularity, their ability to fill arenas, the excitement that they could generate, and the money that they could generate -- each piece of it is sort of falling apart or at least coming under a lot of question. Again, they're going to have to seriously retool what it is that they are doing, if they want these numbers to turn around and if they want their prospects to improve.
If they're not ahead in money and they seem to be slipping in the polls, especially in swing states, at some point, you have to say, we're doing this all wrong. And the president's admittedly very good political and cultural instincts seem to be failing him at this time.
BERMAN: This is -- Errol just brought up the fundraiser that former President Obama did with Joe Biden last night. We have some sound from the former president we want to play you.

It continued the trend of shocking rises in violent crime in NYC since May
So far in 2020, murder is up 40% and shootings up 91% from last year
Flaring tempers, depressed economy and gang violence have contributed
Police Commissioner touted 98% increase in gun arrests in September
Murders in New York City rose 79 percent last month compared to last year, and shooting incidents soared 127 percent, according to new NYPD crime statistics.
The citywide crime stats released on Friday show that New York's summer crime wave continued into September, as the city continues to grapple with a disturbing rise in violence.
Tensions in the city remain high after months of coronavirus lockdowns, economic misery and unrest in the streets, causing petty disputes to frequently escalate quickly into violence. As well, police say that gang violence has been a major factor in the rise in shootings.
There were 152 shooting incidents across the city in September, compared to just 67 such incidents in the same month last year, a 127 percent rise, the data shows. Over the first nine months of 2020, shootings were up 91 percent.
Also last month, there were 51 murders in New York, compared to 29 in September of last year, an increase of 79 percent.
Through September 30, there were 344 murders in the city, compared to 246 murders in the first nine months of 2019, an increase of 40 percent.
Burglaries also rose an alarming 38 percent in September, and were up 42 percent for the year through September 30.
Overall, index crimes rose just 2 percent in September, with the rise in shootings and murders counter-balanced in part by declines in hate crimes (down 33 percent so far this year) and reported rapes (down 19 percent in September).
Police say that sex crimes continue to go under-reported, and urge victims to come forward by contacting the NYPD Special Victims Division. 
In a press release, the NYPD touted its strong enforcement efforts, saying that gun arrests rose 98 percent in September from the same month last year. 
'NYPD officers have achieved this record level of enforcement despite the approximately 2,500 officer reduction in manpower-from attrition and no new academy classes-as well as a 59 percent cut to the uniformed overtime budget,' the department said.
Previously, Police Commissioner Dermot Shea has directly blamed Mayor Bill de Blasio's $1 billion cut to the NYPD budget for the city's recent surge in crime.
The $1 billion budget cut resulted in policing funds being reallocated to education and social services over the next year. 
'You think back, crime follows certain patterns and trends. Certainly, we see upticks if violence in the summer... To have this crazy time happen this year, certainly, and leading to a defunding, it's really hurt,' Shea told Fox Business Network last week.
'This defunding movement at a time when we know crime generally takes an upward trajectory in the summer has been a double-whammy.'
Shea said the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the court system and legislative factors such as bail reform had also played a role in surging crime rates. 
On Friday, Shea praised the men and women of the NYPD for the sharp rise in arrests for illegal guns in September.
'Despite the unparalleled challenges they face every day, our officers continue to engage with the community and zero in on the drivers of crime,' Shea said in a statement.
'I thank the men and women of the NYPD who work relentlessly, day-in and day-out, to keep New Yorkers in every neighborhood safe. We will continue to address crime upticks and work in close partnership with the residents we are sworn to serve,' he added.
Across the country, most major cities have seen a sharp rise in violent crimes since late May. 
On Thursday, actor Rick Moranis, 67, got an unfortunate taste of New York City's rising violence when a man punched him in the face in a shocking unprovoked sidewalk attack on the Upper West Side.
Video released by NYPD shows the 'Honey, I Shrunk The Kids' star walking southbound on Central Park West near West 70th Street at about 7.30am on Thursday.
Suddenly, an unidentified man wearing an 'I Love NY' hoodie strikes Moranis in the head, knocking him to the ground.
NYPD did not reveal the victim as Moranis in the public alert, but law enforcement confirmed his identity to the New York Post."

A recurring theme of the epic service for the 46-year-old was that a man raised in a public housing project had ""changed the world"".
About a dozen of Mr Floyd's family members, dressed in white, spoke on stage of their memories and their pain at his loss.
His young niece Brooke Williams delivered a fiery speech about her uncle in which she said: ""America, it is time for a change!"" The young woman said her uncle had been the victim of a ""hate crime"". ""Somebody said 'Make America great again',"" she said. ""But when has America ever been great?
""That officer showed no remorse for watching my uncle's soul leave his body. ""These laws need to be changed. No more hate crimes please. This is not just a murder, but a hate crime."" About 500 people were invited to the funeral in the Fountains of Praise church in Houston, which followed memorial services last week in Minneapolis and Raeford, the North Carolina town where Floyd was born.
Celebrity attendees included actors Jamie Foxx and Tatum Channing. As the service closed, civil rights leader the Reverend Al Sharpton said that Mr Floyd's death was not just a tragedy - it was a crime.
""Until these people pay for what they did we will be there with them because lives like George Floyd will not matter until somebody pays the cost for taking their lives,"" he said.
""We are going to fight on, we are going to fight on, we are going to fight on."" Despite the service being described as ""private"", it was broadcast live on every major US broadcast and cable news channel. The New York Stock Exchange observed eight minutes and 46 seconds of silence - the amount of time that police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on Mr Floyd's neck before he died.
Former US vice-president Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential -candidate in the November 3 poll, spoke via a video recording. ""Why in this nation do too many black Americans wake up knowing that they could lose their life in the course of just living their life?"" Mr Biden said.
Mr Floyd's brother Rodney told mourners: ""Third Ward, Cuney Homes, that's where he was born at. But everybody is going to remember him around the world. He is going to change the world."" After the service, Mr Floyd's body was taken by horse-drawn carriage to a cemetery in suburban Pearland, where he was to be laid to rest next to his mother.

It follows a complaint letter from staff citing a column in which he claimed black people are more likely to commit a hate crime than white people
The complaint also mentioned Baker's comments on social media
Staff claimed the former editor in chief of the publication was not being held to the standards set out for the news department
His reassignment to the opinion section gives Baker more leeway
The Wall Street Journal said the move was already being discussed before Monday's complaint from staff
A former editor in chief of the Wall Street Journal has been reassigned after complaints from staff regarding a column in which he alleged that black people commit the most hate crimes.
A letter of complaint from staff members was sent to newsroom leaders on Monday, the New York Times reports, citing the column and the social media activity of Gerard Baker, who has worked as an editor at large at The Journal since he left the top job in 2018.
The letter, sent from the union representing the Wall Street Journal employees, claimed that Baker had broken the social media policy for employees working in the news section.
He has now been reassigned to the opinion section where social media activity is not under the same stringent set of rules. 
The board of the Independent Association of Publishers' Employees sent the letter Monday to the Wall Street Journal's current editor in chief Matt Murray and its new publisher Almar Latour.
It singled out a May 15 column by Baker entitled 'The Often Distorted Reality of Hate Crime in America' which it said did not align with the standards meant to be maintained by those working in the news section of the company.
The column outlines the death of unarmed black jogger Ahmaud Arbery who was shot and killed by two white men in Georgia in February.
Arbery's death had sparked outrage as the two men were not arrested or charged with his death until a video of the killing emerged months later.
Baker compared Arbery's death to the killing of an elderly white couple by a black man in May and criticized the lack of media attention it was given.
He continued to allege that black people are more likely to be the perpetrators of hate crimes than white people.
The letter from the I.A.P.E criticized Baker's argument and claimed that the only proof he gave for the claim were his own calculations.
According to the New York Times, the complaint letter read that the column in question 'posits the highly controversial argument that black people commit more hate crimes than white people' and the to '""prove"" that he uses only his own single weighted statistical calculation, with no attribution or context from experts either to support the idea or provide contrary views'.
The letter added that staff expect Baker to be held to the same standards as other members of the news section.
Baker had remained classified as a member of the news department since his move to editor at large despite expressing opinion in his weekly column.
The Wall Street Journal said in a statement to the New York Times that reassigning Baker was already being discussed before Monday's letter of complaint.
'Conversations about Gerry's move to Opinion have been underway for some time,' a spokeswoman said.
'His new, expanded role will include podcasts and other projects.'
He is now a member of the opinion staff and will work under editorial page editor, Paul A. Gigot.
Here, he will not have to abide by the same rules as the newsroom and will be given more leeway with his social media posting.
Baker worked as the Wall street Journal's editor in chief for five-and-a-half years before moving on to become a weekly columnist and working as editor at large.
During his time in the top role, the paper was involved in breaking information on payments allegedly made by President Donald Trump to women who had sexual relations with him.
His tenure as editor in chief was not without its own controversy, however, after he accused his staff of adding commentary to their reporting on Trump.
Staff pushed back and the tension resulted in dozens leaving for other publications.
Baker's reassignment comes days after the resignation of James Bennet, 54, the former editorial page editor at the New York Times. 
He left after staff were angered with him over the publication of an op-ed calling on the use of the military to disband George Floyd protests from Senator Tom Cotton.
The Philadelphia Inquirer's top editor also resigned on Saturday after an uproar over a headline lamenting damage to businesses amid turbulent protests denouncing police brutality against people of color.
The newspaper announced that Stan Wischnowski, 58, was stepping down as senior vice president and executive editor.
The Inquirer had apologized for a 'horribly wrong' decision to use the headline, 'Buildings Matter, Too,' on a column about looting and vandalism on the margins of protests of George Floyd's death in Minneapolis at the hands of a white police officer."

In general, things seemed to be going well and going towards the right direction because Seoul Pride had been going to the Festival for about ten years now and the first time I went there, the size of it was approximately 2000 or 3000 people but last year, they had over 120,000 people so the size of it has become really big and there have been more video coverage about LGBTQ people in general and mainstream people even included, not like very out loud but subtly, they are included more queer and LGBT -- LGBTQ little by little so things seem to be going to the right direction but this one outbreak happened in people had to face, they had to face the fact that things weren't actually is good as they seemed or they expect there have always been problem. 
Heezy Yang in South Korea. You are watching Coronavirus: Your Stories. I am Philippa Thomas and we are looking this week at virus and edges. Next, a young photographer in New York city sees a rise in abuse directed at Asian-American basis. I was waiting in line at a grocery store a day after the shelter in place order was enacted in New York city and there were clear guidelines in New York city but a man behind me was hovering behind me to the point where I could almost feel his breath and he was so close and he didn't have a mask on. I completely asked him some space and he said what did you say to me, 'chink'? Any cut in front of me. I was focusing on an increase in hate crimes against Asian-Americans since Tom had made his first reference to a Chinese virus before that incident that I wanted to believe my experience was kind of an isolated incident since I live in such a racially and culturally diverse city like New York city. So Haruka, that happened to you and you start asking around and realise this isn't an isolated incident? Right, so I started to realise that there was a pattern of these incidents and I started to do some research, I found several Facebook groups where Asian-Americans were self-supporting incidents of racial aggression via text and video and I came across advocacy organisations that compiled a virtual map of aggravated incident reports from Asian-Americans who had experienced racial aggressions across the US and this virtual map already included up to 1000 cases by the time I was conducting the research but that number currently surpasses 1500 and interestingly enough, the NYPD hate crimes statistics summary at this point included only one report of hate crime towards Asians at this point, so as you can imagine the numbers weren't really adding up and I was shocked to hear the statistics, to be honest. Underreporting has always been an ongoing issue in our community but I also felt like bringing public attention to this issue, our experiences would be confined to these on line spaces are never be taken seriously unless we do the documenting ourselves. So let's look at some of the documenting. I know you've got a whole series of case studies. If we we take a couple, Justin, for example, tell me his story. Yes, so Justin is a registered nurse who was harassed by a man on his way home on the subway, and the man made a reference to chinks spreading all this sickness, and telling him to go back to his country. It was particularly heartbreaking about Justin's story was that this is one of many incidents that he had"

Here's more from Gossip On This[2]: It goes on to say that the two parted ways until Priest resurfaced years later in trouble. Apparently, he had yet another lover, who he had gotten pregnant, and he needed $65K 'to protect himself and his children from his wife and pay Carrie to abort her unborn child.' Cooper proceeded to lend her old flame the money as a loan, but Priest used it to divorce his wife and run off with the pregnant girlfriend, according to a lawsuit by Cooper.

The original story appeared in Sing Tao Daily[1]Translated and condensed by Rong Xiaoqing from ChineseMore than a hundred protesters gathered at Washington Square Park on Aug. 15, demanding justice for the 90-year-old Chinese woman who was set on fire in Brooklyn last month.[2] Hip-hop singer China Mac, the organizer of the rally, urged law enforcement to investigate the case as a hate crime. He also urged Chinese Americans to fill out the Census questionnaire and to vote in the upcoming election.As of Friday, the NYPD said the incident—in which two men slapped the woman and lit her shirt on fire, according to news reports—has not yet been classified as a hate crime, but that members of the department's Hate Crimes Task Force are working with the 62nd Precinct to investigate, a spokeswoman told City Limits. AsAmNews previously reported[3] on that change.Prior to the Aug. 15 rally, China Mac, whose real name is Raymond Yu, held another protest at the start of the month for the victim in Bensonhurst, where the July 14 incident took place. Protesters marched for two miles to condemn racism and hate crimes, chanting, 'when grandma is attacked, we stand up and fight back,' and 'no justice, no peace.'Yu said he was furious at the NYPD's initial response to the crime, and urged the community to unite in fighting against racism and hate crimes.'We are treated as foreigners in our own country, and we are discriminated against as a whole group,' said Yu.

'I want you to go online and sign the petition to urge them to do so.'

The citywide crime stats released on Friday show that New York's summer crime wave continued into September, as the city continues to grapple with a disturbing rise in violence, Daily Mail reported.
Tensions in the city remain high after months of coronavirus lockdowns, economic misery and unrest in the streets, causing petty disputes to frequently escalate quickly into violence. As well, police say that gang violence has been a major factor in the rise in shootings.
There were 152 shooting incidents across the city in September, compared to just 67 such incidents in the same month last year, a 127 percent rise, the data shows. Over the first nine months of 2020, shootings were up 91 percent.
Also last month, there were 51 murders in New York, compared to 29 in September of last year, an increase of 79 percent.
Through September 30, there were 344 murders in the city, compared to 246 murders in the first nine months of 2019, an increase of 40 percent.
Burglaries also rose an alarming 38 percent in September, and were up 42 percent for the year through September 30.
Overall, index crimes rose just 2 percent in September, with the rise in shootings and murders counter-balanced in part by declines in hate crimes (down 33 percent so far this year) and reported rapes (down 19 percent in September).
Police say that sex crimes continue to go under-reported, and urge victims to come forward by contacting the NYPD Special Victims Division.
In a press release, the NYPD touted its strong enforcement efforts, saying that gun arrests rose 98 percent in September from the same month last year.
""NYPD officers have achieved this record level of enforcement despite the approximately 2,500 officer reduction in manpower-from attrition and no new academy classes-as well as a 59 percent cut to the uniformed overtime budget,"" the department said.
Previously, Police Commissioner Dermot Shea has directly blamed Mayor Bill de Blasio's $1 billion cut to the NYPD budget for the city's recent surge in crime.
The $1 billion budget cut resulted in policing funds being reallocated to education and social services over the next year.
""You think back, crime follows certain patterns and trends. Certainly, we see upticks if violence in the summer... To have this crazy time happen this year, certainly, and leading to a defunding, it's really hurt,"" Shea told Fox Business Network last week.
""This defunding movement at a time when we know crime generally takes an upward trajectory in the summer has been a double-whammy,"" Shea added.
Shea said the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the court system and legislative factors such as bail reform had also played a role in surging crime rates.
On Friday, Shea praised the men and women of the NYPD for the sharp rise in arrests for illegal guns in September.
""Despite the unparalleled challenges they face every day, our officers continue to engage with the community and zero in on the drivers of crime,"" Shea said in a statement.
""I thank the men and women of the NYPD who work relentlessly, day-in and day-out, to keep New Yorkers in every neighborhood safe. We will continue to address crime upticks and work in close partnership with the residents we are sworn to serve,"" he added.
Across the country, most major cities have seen a sharp rise in violent crimes since late May.
On Thursday, actor Rick Moranis, 67, got an unfortunate taste of New York City's rising violence when a man punched him in the face in a shocking unprovoked sidewalk attack on the Upper West Side.
Video released by NYPD shows the ""Honey, I Shrunk The Kids"" star walking southbound on Central Park West near West 70th Street at about 7.30am on Thursday.
Suddenly, an unidentified man wearing an ""I Love NY"" hoodie strikes Moranis in the head, knocking him to the ground.
NYPD did not reveal the victim as Moranis in the public alert, but law enforcement confirmed his identity to the New York Post. - FNA"

 LaLiga has promoted 'Intolerance is still there', a short film from today's Heroes platform set in the Stonewall riots in New York in 1969, the night the LGTBI+ community rebelled, coinciding with International Day for Tolerance on November 16.
 'Heroes of Today' is an initiative promoted by major global brands such as LaLiga, Bankia, Iberia, Telepizza, EDP and Clínica Baviera. The short film portrays the riots that occurred at the New York pub Stonewall Inn in June 1969.
 This revolt consisted of a series of spontaneous and violent demonstrations in protest against a police raid. Today, these facts are remembered as the first time in U.S. history when the LGTBI+ community fought against a system that persecutes people for their sexual identity.
 This piece also denounces the story of Julio Zúñiga, Mexican gay activist and footballer of an LGTBI+ league. Zúñiga was never in the Stonewall riots or on the filming of 'Intolerance is still there', as he was killed in Mexico in 2017, the victim of a hate crime because of his sexual status.
 By linking past and present, the content of 'Intolerance is still there' becomes a message of denunciation of discrimination in today's society, especially in the world of sport where it is not common to see professionals publicly declaring their homosexuality.
 In 2019, 'Racism is still there' was the first content released by the platform. On that occasion, the film starred Jesse Owens, one of 18 African-American athletes who competed at the 1936 Berlin Olympics.
 The piece showed his experiences during his journey to the mythical Olympic Stadium, reflecting the racial discrimination that existed at the time and that has reached the present day. "

A founding member of Black Lives Matter said President Trump was the 'embodiment of white supremacist terrorism' and 'terrorist in chief' over his recent comments on the movement.
Melina Abdullah on Thursday appeared on CNN's Newsroom to blast the embattled commander-in-chief for calling a proposed Black Lives Matter mural outside of Trump Tower a 'symbol of hate.'
'I think it's the height of hypocrisy for Donald Trump to call anything a symbol of hate,' said Abdullah, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter Los Angeles chapter and a Pan-African studies professor at California State University. 
'He is the embodiment of hate, and for him to say that affirming the value of black life is somehow hate, again, reminds us of who he is.'
In response to claims that Trump is stoking the flames of both political and racial divide with harmful rhetoric, Abdullah pointed to white supremacy. 
'I think we need to remember who he is. That Donald Trump is the embodiment of white supremacist terrorism.'
On Wednesday, Trump lashed out at New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio for cutting $1billion from the NYPD's budget and proposing to paint a Black Lives Matter mural in front of his Fifth Avenue skyscraper. 
'NYC is cutting Police $'s by ONE BILLION DOLLARS, and yet the New York City Mayor is going to paint a big, expensive, yellow Black Lives Matter sign on Fifth Avenue, denigrating this luxury Avenue,' wrote Trump
'This will further antagonize New York's Finest, who LOVE New York & vividly remember the horrible BLM chant, ""Pigs In A Blanket, Fry 'Em Like Bacon.""'
'Maybe our GREAT Police, who have been neutralized and scorned by a mayor who hates & disrespects them, won't let this symbol of hate be affixed to New York's greatest street. Spend this money fighting crime instead!'
Mayor de Blasio said painting for the mural will begin on Thursday, but postponed the event without an explanation from city officials.
Similar murals were painted in front of the White House and across other cities in support of the movement. 
Abdullah continued to lambaste Trump by pointing out that he shared an inflammatory video of two supporters yelling 'white power' to his Twitter feed.
Trump also shared a video of a Missouri couple brandishing an AR-15 and a handgun at anti-police brutality protesters this week.
The 'white power' video was eventually deleted from Trump's twitter with White House officials claiming the president did not hear that part.
'When he he is tweeting videos of people throwing up white power...and really entrenching himself within the white terrorist movement. He's done that not just only over the last week, but over the last four years,' said Abdullah. 
'And you see that really manifest in terms of the surge in hate crimes, which are primarily meted out on black people and at the hands of white people.'
A study released by the Pew Research Center on Wednesday showed nearly 60 per cent of Asian Americans and 45 per cent of Black Americans believed that it was 'more common for people to express racist views toward their group since the coronavirus outbreak.' 
Abdullah said the polarization and instances of police brutality against minorities rested squarely on Trump's shoulders. 
'So it's really important to understand what Donald Trump has done to this country, and where he's chosen to align himself,' she said.
'So for him, again, to call anything hate is really the height of hypocrisy and we need as a country to be willing to point to him and say that he is actually the terrorist in chief.'
CNN Host Brooke Baldwin responded to Abdullah that 'those are strong words.'
'Obviously the White House would dispute that,' said Abdullah. 
'But you're allowed your freedom of opinion, and the fact is that the president is highly critical of Black Lives Matter.' 
Trump has been continuously ridiculed for his response to recent Black Lives Matter protests that sparked after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, two months ago. 
He was condemned over his heavy-handed military response to often peaceful protests, appearing to incite further divide between civilians using prejudice rhetoric and for using the widely contested phrase 'When the looting starts, the shooting starts.'
Meanwhile, he's repeatedly claimed that he's done more for the Black community than any president besides Abraham Lincoln, who was credited with freeing African-American slaves after the Civil War. 
The president pointed to the bipartisan criminal justice bill he signed.
'And I got five or six Republicans Senators who had no interest in getting it done,' Trump reminded Faulkner.
The president also pointed to getting prolonged funding for historically black colleges and universities. "

Antisemitic and racist graffiti scrawled on the street in a town in northern New Jersey over Halloween as been condemned as 'disturbing' and 'a hate crime'. 
The graffiti was found in Woodcliff Lake, in the Woodmont neighbourhood, on the morning of October 31. 
The mayor of Woodcliff Lake shared the photographs of the graffiti scrawled in white chalk on Woodmont Drive which included a swastika, the drawing of a penis, and the words 'Jews' and 'n-----'.
Woodcliff Lake Mayor Carols A. Rendo said: 'These images are disturbing and criminal. It is vandalism and a hate crime. 
'The perpetrators will be dealt with to the fullest extent of the law. Any resident with information on this please contact our police department. 
The crime happened on Mischief Night, an informal holiday on the night before Halloween, when children and teenagers are emboldened to engage in pranks and vandalism. 
The extent of their pranks usually range from dangling toilet paper and silly string from trees, and throwing soap or eggs on parked cars. 
The Mayor Carols A. Rendo told the New York Post: 'A resident text me early in the morning and I was quite disturbed and upset by it.' 
He said he expects that the perpetrators are 'ignorant kids who thought it was funny.'
According to the Post, there are a significant number of Jewish Americans living in Woodcliff Lake.

'Residents with info are encouraged to contact police HQ at 201-391-8222. We are taking this matter very seriously as this conduct is unacceptable in our community.' 
Bias crimes in New Jersey are on the rise. Last year, the state of New Jersey logged 994 bias incidents, almost a 75% increase from the year before.
It is the most largest year-to-year increase since New Jersey began tracking incidents and the state's highest total. "

The NYPD released surveillance footage of the two suspects
The New York Police Department are searching for two men who slapped an 89-year-old woman in the face before lighting her shirt on fire this month.
The disturbing incident happened on July 14 when an elderly Chinese resident was outside her home in Brooklyn.
Authorities said the two suspects approached the woman and, without warning, struck her across the face. 
Then, they allegedly set the back of her shirt on fire with a match or a lighter before they fled the scene.
Surveillance footage released by the NYPD shows two men, both wearing hats and masks that shield their face, walking near 16th Avenue & 77 Street in Brooklyn. 
The unidentified woman revealed in an interview with ABC 7 this week that she had just left her home in the Bensonhurst neighborhood when it happened.
Speaking through a Cantonese translator, the victim said the one of the men slapped her in the face and then seconds later she felt a sharp pain on her back.
One she realized that her shirt was on fire, the victim pulled up her hair so it would't burn and rubbed her back against a nearby wall.
A large scorch mark left on her shirt shows just how large the flame got before it was extinguished.
The victim said she's never seen the men before and they didn't speak a word. 
She didn't tell her family what happened to her until the next morning because she did not want her children to worry. 
The suspects did not try to steal any of her items, prompting some to believe it was a hate crime.
'These two individual persons picked on an Asian senior to commit this heinous crime. There's no other reason than for it to be a hate crime,' the translator told ABC 7. 
Authorities said there's currently no evidence that she was specifically targeted and the suspects reportedly did not use any derogatory language. 
Maria Castellano, a neighbor who witnessed the incident, told WLNY that there didn't appear to be any interaction before the attack.
'I just saw these two kids push her for nothing. She was looking in the garden,' said Castellano.
'No reason at all. I mean, she didn't do nothing. Why are you pushing the poor woman?' 
Board members from the local Brooklyn community center and residents have created a $10,000 reward for any information about the incident that could lead to an arrest. 
Authorities urged the community to report information about the incident and to contact NYPD Tips at 800-577-TIPS.

Rogers, who prosecutors say is an admitted K.K.K. leader, faces three additional counts of attempted malicious wounding, a felony.
A man who prosecutors described as a Ku Klux Klan leader was sentenced this week to six years in prison after driving into a group of Black Lives Matter protesters outside Richmond, Va., in June.
The man, Harry H. Rogers, 36, was convicted on Monday by a judge in Henrico County District Court of six misdemeanors, including assault, destruction of property and hit-and-run charges. He was handed the maximum penalty on each count.
Mr. Rogers still faces three felony counts of attempted malicious wounding.
The charges all stemmed from an episode on June 7. The Henrico County police were notified that witnesses at a protest north of Richmond had reported that a vehicle revved its engine and “drove through the protesters occupying the roadway.” There were no life-threatening injuries reported, according to Lt. Matthew Pecka of the Henrico County Police Department. Shannon L. Taylor, the commonwealth’s attorney for Henrico County, said three people were injured.
Ms. Taylor described Mr. Rogers in a statement as “an admitted leader of the Ku Klux Klan and a propagandist for Confederate ideology.” Despite a decline in organized K.K.K. groups in the United States, there has been a consistent link between criminal activity and the group, according to the Anti-Defamation League.
The authorities presented additional charges against Mr. Rogers in late June, including four counts of assault with hate crimes. Although the judge convicted Mr. Rogers of the four assault charges without applying Ms. Taylor’s hate-crime enhancements, Mr. Rogers received the maximum sentence for each of the six counts on which he was convicted.
On Monday, Judge Thomas O. Bondurant Jr. of Henrico General District Court ruled that Mr. Rogers did not target the demonstrators because of their race, WTVR-TV reported. Mr. Rogers’s lawyer had previously argued that because the protesters were white, the hate-crime enhancements didn’t apply, according to the station.
George Townsend, who is listed as Mr. Rogers’s lawyer, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.
Ms. Taylor said the hate-crime enhancements to the charges against Mr. Rogers were necessary, even if the people Mr. Rogers injured were white demonstrators.
“You were still being selected for race,” she said. “You were still being considered inadequate, inferior because you were supporting the African-American community that the Klan 100 percent says in its own written materials — and part of their ideology that they believe — are lesser human beings.”
There have been numerous instances of drivers striking demonstrators with cars, causing serious and fatal injuries, at some of the protests that have erupted across the country since the death of George Floyd in police custody this spring. In July, Summer Taylor of Seattle died after being struck by a car that entered a closed-off section of an interstate where a small group of protesters were gathered.
In 2017, Heather Heyer was hit and killed after James A. Fields drove his car into counterprotesters at a “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Va. Mr. Fields was later sentenced to life in prison.

Chief of Detectives Rodney Harrison tweeted Tuesday: ""After a thorough investigation by the NYPD's Manhattan South investigators, it has been determined that there was no criminality by shake shack's employees.""
A police source told the New York Daily News that it seemed a milkshake machine at the Fulton Transit Center Shake Shack wasn't cleaned correctly.
Due to the poor cleaning job, there were remnants of a cleaning product in the machine - which contained bleach, according to the report.
The news comes after the NYPD launched an investigation after three officers were allegedly poisoned at a Shake Shack restaurant while working during a protest in New York.
In response to Harrison's announcement, Shake Shack tweeted: ""Our team is working hard to get the full picture.
""In the meantime, we're relieved to hear the officers are all okay.""
Three cops fell ill after consuming food from the popular burger chain - and it was first believed that an employee may have filled the cops' milkshakes with bleach.
The men, members of the Bronx's 42nd Precinct assigned to watch the protests, were rushed to Bellevue Hospital after eating the food from Shake Shack on Broadway and Fulton Street in downtown Manhattan on Monday night.
Sources told the New York Daily News that the officers had noticed that their milkshakes tasted odd - with one reportedly smelling bleach.
NYPD officers searched for evidence at the Shake Shack and in garbage cans outside the building, while employees were being interviewed.
The three men are in a stable condition in hospital, and no arrests have been made.
 'POISONED WITH BLEACH' 
According to the New York Daily News, three employees, two men and a woman, were taken into an NYPD van - however, they were not handcuffed.
Investigators found a bottle of cleaning fluid that was used to clean the shake machines, but at the time it was unclear whether the officers had been purposely targeted.
New York's Patrolmen's Benevolent Association has issued a statement warning officers to beware of food and drink prepared by others, after ""a toxic substance, believed to be bleach"" had been put in the officers' drinks.
It read: ""When NYC police officers cannot even take meal without coming under attack, it is clear that the environment in which we work has deteriorated to a critical level.
""We cannot afford to let our guard down for even a moment.""
Despite the suspicion, the NYPD did not mentioned bleach or other disinfectant products in their statement - only stating that the officers possibly fell ill after drinking milkshakes from the restaurant.
 SUSPECTED HATE CRIME 
The NYC Detective's Endowment Association also tweeted a warning, stating that the three officers had been ""intentionally poisoned.""
They wrote: ""Tonight, three of our fellow officers were intentionally poisoned by one or more workers at the Shake Shack at 200 Broadway in Manhattan. Fortunately, they were not seriously harmed.""
Shake Shack tweeted that they were ""horrified"" by the reports and that they would be working with cops in the investigation.
The alleged poisoning ordeal comes with a forceful anti-police sentiment in the US following the death of George Floyd.
Floyd was killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis, US, after kneeling on his neck for nearly nine minutes.
His death has sparked a series of Black Lives Matter protests across the globe, including daily marches in the US which have involved violent clashes between protestors and cops.
Protestors have begun calls to defund the police and to replace officials with more community-style policing methods.
NYPD announced yesterday that it will get rid of its plain-clothes anti-crime unit - who have been responsible for some of New York's most notorious shootings.

Ricky Bellevue, 35, and another man approached two other men and made anti-gay statements around noon on Tuesday in the Bronx, police said.
According to police, Bellevue showed a box cutter and attempted to take one of the men's bags, slashing him in the face and hands in the ensuing struggle before being taken into custody by police.
The NYPD said charges including robbery as a hate crime and assault were pending.
Last month, cellphone video showed Officer David Afanador putting his arm around Bellevue’s neck after he had been tackled by police and as he lay face down on the boardwalk in Queens.
Afanador was suspended and charged with strangulation and attempted aggravated strangulation.
He pleaded not guilty, and his lawyer said he was facing a rush to judgment amid public pressure to hold police officers accountable for alleged misconduct following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
Attorney Sanford Rubenstein, who is representing Bellevue in the June incident, said he suffers from mental illness, and had been admitted by his family to a mental health unit at a hospital in late June only to be discharged last week.
In regard to the incident on Tuesday, Rubenstein said, Bellevue is “still a victim, he's a victim of an illegal chokehold, this doesn't change that."""

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TOMIKA MILLER, WIDOW OF RAYSHARD BROOKS: Do they feel sorry for what they've taken away? That's what I want to know, you know. If they had the chance to do it again would they do it the same way or would they do it totally different?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR: That was Rayshard Brooks' widow calling for change.
Hundreds of others rallying outside the Georgia State Capitol yesterday. Protesters calling for an end to police violence and for lawmakers to officially pass a hate crimes bill there.
Joining us now is Georgia's Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan. Lt. Gov., thanks for being here this morning.
LT. GOV. GEOFF DUNCAN (R-GA) (via Cisco Webex): Good morning, Alisyn.
CAMEROTA: So it's heartbreaking, obviously, listening to the raw emotion of Rayshard Brooks' family. When you've watched that videotape of what happened the night that he was shot, what do you see on there?
DUNCAN: Well, you know, I watched it this weekend alongside my family. And as we've talked about before, I've got three kids and my wife, and sitting there in the family room watching that play out -- I mean, it's just -- it's so disturbing to watch those series of events happen so quickly.
And, you know, certainly, the mayor has pulled together a task force that's trying to analyze their policies around the use of deadly force. And I think as a state, we can also look for opportunities to create a more defined, more uniform definition of the use of deadly force as we move forward.
CAMEROTA: Let's talk about that. What police reforms, specifically, would you like to see? DUNCAN: Well look, I think it's a broad conversation. We're watching both Democrats and Republicans in the House and the Senate here. I know that we're hearing word that at the federal level there's going to be some movement and some traction on reforms.
But I think the most important place to start, Alisyn, is a conversation. We've got to start to build trust across all the boundaries and divides and bridges. We've got to start to have conversations and I think that's the -- that's the best starting point for all of us.
CAMEROTA: Look, I hear you, and obviously, we've been having these tough conversations on the program now for at least three weeks since George Floyd's death.
But what the protesters are saying is that they're reading for action. They're tired of this. They feel that they've been trying to have these conversations and that they have fallen on deaf ears.
And so, what they want first, I think, are some charges. Do you expect charges to be filed today against one or both of those officers?
DUNCAN: So, I'm not going to weigh into an ongoing investigation with the Atlanta Police Department. That's the city of Atlanta, and the mayor, and the district attorney, and so I'd point you in their direction.
But I agree with you on the action portion. I mean, folks are ready for action. If we're going to truly build trust it can't just be words, it's got to be actions.
And so for us, the traction is around our hate crimes legislation here in the state of Georgia. You know, I applaud the House of Representatives for presenting an initial piece of legislation and bringing it over to the Senate. And now, we have an opportunity to, I believe, dramatically improve that legislation just like the process is supposed to happen.
Building consensus, Democrats and Republicans -- folks in communities from all over the state my office is working with to develop a strategy around a piece of legislation that -- we believe in powers communities.
You know, we've talked and you and I have talked about this before. I think we need to empower communities. Empower a grand jury to be able to bring forward these charges of hate crimes, not just a sole prosecutor that may or may not think a hate crime has been committed.
Let's empower the communities. Let's give any sort of victim an opportunity to be heard.
CAMEROTA: And when we talked about that last, Lt. Gov., it was last week and you said that you basically predicted the time line and thought that you had 11 days to come up with a plan or some specifics. And so, where are you now with that? DUNCAN: Yes. So, we're right on time.
Today -- this afternoon, we'll be releasing a version of our legislative draft of our hate crimes version of the bill. We have built bipartisan support and continue to just be overwhelmed with the folks that continue to give us great input. We drafted a couple of ideas early and we brought Democrats and Republicans and others together to draft, in my office, what we believe is going to be a strong version of a hate crimes bill.
Because at the end of the day, I don't want my legacy to be that I supported the weakest hate crimes bill in the country. I want to put policy over politics. We're not going to have -- partisan corners isn't going to solve this challenge in front of us. It's going to be policy over politics.
We should see a hearing in Judiciary this week and then we should see it move to the Senate floor quickly. And my hope is that we can send a bipartisanly-supported bill over to the House of Representatives and have them quickly approve it and put it on the governor's desk.
CAMEROTA: And so, since you're announcing some of the details today, can you give us a preview? What's in it?
DUNCAN: Well, yes, certainly. We're going to have a standalone charge instead of just being a sentence enhancement where a sole prosecutor petitions the judge. And sometime between the time of the charge and sometime before the trial they just -- you know, they petition the judge.
[07:35:00]
We're going to do something separately and empower the community and let that charge be a standalone charge of a hate crime. So if somebody's charged with assault and battery, they'll also be charged with a hate crime if it fits within the definition, and then that charge will be -- will be carried out through the courtroom.
And some will have the opportunity to defend themselves, too. I mean, I think that's an important part of the process as we move forward.
CAMEROTA: And why has this been so hard for Georgia? Why is Georgia one of only four states in the country that doesn't have this yet?
DUNCAN: You know, I think that -- you know, I don't know. I'm relatively new to the job. I was a state rep for five years before that.
It has certainly become a priority -- and in my opinion, in my office, it is absolutely a priority. I decided, as we talked about last week, I wanted to become a subject matter expert. I wanted to know what problem this was solving and it -- there is -- there is a problem and we want to -- we want to come right at this.
We want to send a very clear message that Georgia is going to be the worst state to commit a hate crime in and I think that is a great opportunity to start building a strong relationship all across the state.
CAMEROTA: Last time when you were here we talked about Ahmaud Arbery and his mother's desperate plea for justice of some kind and for a hate crimes bill. And now, here we are again just one week later, Lt. Gov., with another family who lost their loved one tragically and way too soon, and they're pleading.
And, I mean, I know it's impossible to say that that will be the last family that experiences that, but do you think that anything is changing in police forces in Georgia right now? Do you think that the public can feel confident that we're not going to be here next week with this same storyline?
DUNCAN: So, first and foremost, I mean, I think the overwhelming majority of Americans would just express a gratefulness for police and for law enforcement officers that keep our communities safe and to keep our families safe and our businesses.
Certainly, there's opportunities to continue to improve. We are having that discussion here in Georgia.
My hope and my prayer is that it continues to be and tracks towards being a peaceful process. An information sharing, a best -- you know, best processes organization. That's where my hope is and certainly, we're hoping to track in that direction.
I think this hate crimes legislation that we're supporting here in Georgia and hopefully going to be able to get across the finish line very, very shortly is a great step in the right direction, but still more work to be done.
A simple bill does not make this go away. It has to be relationships. It has to be reaching out for your neighbor. It's got to be doing more than just thinking about yourself.
As we talked about on the last show, it's not enough to just not be racist. You've got to be anti-racism, which means you're proactive. You're looking for ways to root it out. And certainly, the hate crimes bill is a step in the right direction.
CAMEROTA: Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, we really appreciate you coming on with a status report. We'll be watching what happens today.
DUNCAN: Thank you for the opportunity.
CAMEROTA: Are police officers feeling the pressure in this -- in the face of this nationwide outcry? So, what we're learning about resignations in police departments across America. What do they mean?
[07:42:26]
JIM SCIUTTO, CNN ANCHOR: George Floyd's killing has led to greater scrutiny of policing nationwide and now, a growing number of resignations in police departments across America. CNN's Josh Campbell live in Minneapolis now with more. And, Josh, do we know one, how extensive, but also what's behind this?
JOSH CAMPBELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it's a great question, Jim.
As police departments in cities like Atlanta and Minneapolis continue to garner international attention, some police officers are turning in their badges. Experts say that as law enforcement continues to face greater scrutiny, a wave of resignations could continue to spread to other police departments across the country.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
CAMPBELL (voice-over): The city of Minneapolis confirming to CNN that at least seven police officers have now left the department since the death of George Floyd last month. And more than half a dozen are now in the process of leaving, departing for unknown reasons.
And it's not just Minneapolis. Other departments around the country are seeing police officers head for the exits, either publicly resigning from tactical teams or leaving their departments altogether.
From Buffalo, where two officers were suspended earlier this month after shoving an elderly protester, 57 officers resigned from the department's Emergency Response Team.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Get your knee --
PROTESTERS: Off my neck.
CAMPBELL (voice-over): To Florida, where the Hallandale Beach SWAT team saw 10 resignations after city officials, including the police chief, took a knee with protesters. Officers there say they feel minimally equipped, undertrained, and restrained by politics.
To Atlanta, where the police department there says at least eight officers have resigned since June first. According to the Atlanta Police Foundation, low morale has taken a toll on the police force.
Earlier this month, six officers were charged and arrested for excessive use of force. That incident followed on Friday by the police shooting of Rayshard Brooks, an African-American man killed after officers attempted to arrest him for a suspected DUI. Brooks had taken one of the officer's Tasers in a scuffle and fired at police as he ran away.
The Atlanta police chief abruptly resigned. The district attorney there says possible charges against the officer who shot Brooks could include felony murder.
A police union official warns this climate will lead to more departures.
VINCE CHAMPION, SOUTHEAST REGIONAL DIRECTOR, INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF POLICE OFFICERS: What we're suffering with in Atlanta, I believe is -- we are playing politics. We are bound down, if you will, to try to appease the rioters.
[07:45:04]
If he gets charged without the due process and everything, I think you're going to find those officers who are senior, who have the time in to get their retirement and leave, they're going to start leaving. I think you're going to start seeing officers trying to find another place to go.
CAMPBELL (voice-over): Other law enforcement experts say Brooks' killing appearing unjustified, and as a nation remains on edge, have a message for those considering dramatic mass resignations.
CHARLES RAMSEY, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: I understand the internal workings of a police department -- the emotion and all that sort of thing. But you've got a job to do and we're in the middle of a crisis across the country. This is not the time to quit. And so, I don't have very much tolerance for that sort of thing.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
CAMPBELL: Now, there remain three hotly-debated issues surrounding policing. On one hand, people want to ensure that bad cops are disciplined. Police unions also want to ensure that any officer charged with a crime is afforded due process.
And in some cities like Minneapolis and Atlanta, elected officials are heeding the call of protesters -- those who are demanding immediate and drastic reform to ensure that those who carry the badge are effectively serving the public -- Alisyn.
CAMEROTA: Really interesting, Josh. Thank you very much for all of that reporting.
So, CNN has learned that Defense Sec. Mark Esper is consulting senior military commanders on how to improve opportunities for black service members.
CNN's Barbara Starr is live for us at the Pentagon with more. So what's the plan?
BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Alisyn.
Well, you know, President Trump may now be determined to keep those names of Confederate generals on military installations, but the Pentagon perhaps moving on a bit from all of this.
Defense Sec. Esper consulting with top military leaders on what is the best way ahead. What really needs to be done to try and address racial inequality in military ranks? There's a lot of concern about it.
Now, you know, these guys have served in these senior positions for some time. You would think they would have realized all this -- that they knew they had a problem. But apparently, some of the recent videos and statements being posted by black service members have really taken them aback and have caused them to pause and listen and try and understand what is going on.
We are told one of the ones that really struck the top leadership here at the Pentagon was posted by Gen. Charles Brown who is about to become the first black chief of staff of any of the services. He will head the U.S. Air Force in just a few weeks.
And he posted this message.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GEN. CHARLES Q. BROWN, U.S AIR FORCE: I'm thinking about a history of racial issues and my own experiences that didn't always sing of liberty and equality.
I'm thinking about my Air Force career where I was often the only African-American in my squadron or as a senior officer, the only African-American in the room.
I'm thinking about wearing the same flight suit with the same wings on my chest as my peers, and then being questioned by another military member, are you a pilot?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
STARR: The White House looms large over any effort that Esper would try to do. The joint chiefs now have moved very rapidly to try and ban the Confederate flag from public spaces on military installations. Whether this can really be carried out and whether Trump decides to challenge them on this and challenge any moves here at the Pentagon still very much an unknown -- Alisyn.
CAMEROTA: You could really see his emotion there in that statement. That was just really interesting to hear.
Thank you very much, Barbara.
STARR: Sure.
CAMEROTA: A new book out on the first lady Melanie Trump is making headlines. Details about her relationship with the president and her influence on some of the biggest decisions he's made. The author joins us, next.
[07:52:50]
CAMEROTA: A revealing new book gives a behind-the-scenes look into the life of first lady Melania Trump. The book depicts Mrs. Trump as far more influential in the White House than we knew.
Joining us now is Pulitzer-prize-winning ""Washington Post"" reporter, Mary Jordan. Mary, great to see you.
So this is juicy.
MARY JORDAN, AUTHOR, ""THE ART OF HER DEAL"", CORRESPONDENT, THE WASHINGTON POST: You, too.
CAMEROTA: It's making a lot of headlines. And I just want to start by reading your statement on how tough it was to kind of crack the code on Melania.
You write, ""In three decades as a correspondent working all over the world, I have often written about the reluctant and the reclusive. But nothing compared to trying to understand Melania. Most people I spoke to would not speak on the record. After interviews with more than 120 people in five countries, a fuller, richer portrait emerged.""
Why is she so sphinxlike?
JORDAN: She does it on purpose. You know, her brand is to be mysterious just as Trump's brand is to never stop talking.
You know, there's no such thing as too much publicity. He made his name by putting Trump on everything -- every building, every magazine. Well, you know, she -- her brand really is the most recognized unknown person perhaps in the world.
CAMEROTA: What are the big policy decisions or just big anything decisions that she has been more involved in?
JORDAN: No, she doesn't get involved in the nitty-gritty of policy very often at all. But very critically, there are almost no big personnel decisions in the White House that are made without her. And the key reason is that Trump trusts her. He thinks she's got good instincts.
And he keeps saying everyone around me -- you know, they turn on me. They leave the White House. I give them a good job and then they criticize me. But, Melania doesn't.
So, for instance, she was critical in picking Vice President Mike Pence when it came down to three final candidates. It was Newt Gingrich, Chris Christie, and Mike Pence. She spent two days with the Pence's and at the end of it, she said to Donald Trump, I think Pence is your guy because he'll be content to be number two and the other two will be gunning for your job.
[07:55:04]
CAMEROTA: That's insightful and really interesting.
And, you know, people try to figure out what their relationship dynamic is because, of course, we're interested. And -- but it's hard to read the tea leaves because at times, we see -- well, we know that they don't share a bedroom. We see her swat his hand away -- we have, at times that he's tried to hold it. At other times they seem to be smiling and connected.
Are they happily married, miserably married? What did you learn?
JORDAN: Well, they've been together 22 years and by all accounts, Donald Trump is not the easiest person to be with for 22 years -- CAMEROTA: Hmm.
JORDAN: -- and that relationship has changed over the time.
I interviewed many people who have been to dinner with them, seen them up close, worked for them, and there is a real connection there, but it has changed. She was -- over time, and it goes up and down. You know, love is complicated and as they say, Trump love is really complicated.
They spend a shocking amount of time physically apart. And yet, the first call he often makes after a speech or a rally is to her. You know, it's a mystery. I don't have a crystal ball about where it's going, but they do have a -- they do have a relationship.
CAMEROTA: Let's talk about her relationship with Ivanka because much has been speculated about that as well.
You wrote, ""Melania has been heard calling Ivanka 'The Princess' out of earshot. When she was younger, Ivanka privately called Melania 'The Portrait,' telling classmates that her father's girlfriend spoke as much as a painting on the wall.""
Do they have as frosty a relationship as has been reported?
JORDAN: Yes, yes. I mean, by all accounts, I spoke to many people and inside the White House there -- particularly at certain times, tense times, there's been team Melania and team Ivanka. And there's a lot of tension there.
The -- when Ivanka came to the White House she really loved it immediately. Melania was up in New York. Ivanka, all of a sudden, said I think we should rename the first lady's office the first family office. And then, of course, Melania put her foot down and said no way.
There couldn't -- they're both former models. They're only 11 1/2 years apart. Ivanka grew up wealthy. Melanie grew up very modestly and worked her way up the modeling world. At 14, Ivanka was already known -- as soon as she started modeling at 14.
They're very different, they don't really get along, and Donald Trump is often the referee.
CAMEROTA: I want to read you what Ivanka -- sorry, what Melania's office -- what the first lady's office has said about your book. They've released a statement to CNN yesterday.
Quote, ""The stories and sources in this book are false. Neither the author nor the publisher reached out with a full list of fact- checking. The first lady's office chose not to participate in this book due to the author's dishonest tactics."" That's from Stephanie Grisham.
What's your response? JORDAN: I sent -- seven months ago I began sending things to fact- check. I asked, for instance, what day -- could you please just tell me what day did Melania actually meet Donald Trump. No response.
So I have a whole list of e-mails that they just don't respond to. So I don't know why they're saying that. They say a lot of things. But I certainly did try.
CAMEROTA: If President Trump is not reelected in November what is next for Melania? Did you get -- ever get to the bottom of that?
JORDAN: No. She gave a really interesting -- and part of the reason this book took so long is I was trying to find documents, videos, and talk to people firsthand. And I went to Paris where she worked, to Milan where she worked, and I did find some things.
And she talked about actually loving to design things. You know, having her own business someday.
There's a lot of things that she could do. She's actually quite creative and very smart. I think she's wildly underestimated just because she's quiet, basically.
As Anthony Scaramucci, who used to work in the White House very briefly, said -- you know, Donald Trump doesn't do co-stars. There's only one star. And, Melania's genius is that she knows that. She always stays in the background.
But once they leave the White House it will be interesting to see if some of these things that she told people in her 20s and 30s about wanting her own business to design things come true.
CAMEROTA: We only have 20 seconds left.
A lot has been written about the prenup that she renegotiated. Did you find out is it much more lucrative? Are there new rules?
JORDAN: Well, Ivana Trump, the first wife, famously said don't get mad, get everything."

BROOKLYN ELECTEDS HOST ROUNDTABLE WITH CHINESE-AMERICAN BUSINESS AND COMMUNITY LEADERS",FALSE,"The following information was released by the office of New York Rep. Max Rose:
Congressman announces support for COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act to combat the rise in discrimination and violence amid coronavirus pandemic
Congressman Max Rose, along with State Senator Andrew Gounardes, Council Member Justin Brannan, and the Office of Assembly Member Peter Abbate, Jr., today hosted a virtual roundtable with Chinese-American community and business leaders to discuss efforts to support small businesses and the community through the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including against rising xenophobia and discrimination.
""What has been happening in the past few months in terms of skyrocketing hate crimes and xenophobia against the Chinese- and Asian-American community as a result of COVID is not only disgusting, it's reprehensible and must utilize every tool at the federal, state, and city level to crack down on it,"" Rose said. ""As we talk about the economy, there's no secret that restaurants owned by Asian-Americans were some of the first to shut down. They need our help and I'm continuing to fight to ensure they have the relief and help they need and deserve.""
During the roundtable, Rose announced his support and co-sponsorship of the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which was introduced by fellow New York City Congressmember Grace Meng. The legislation seeks to provide greater federal government oversight of COVID-19 hate crimes, and require the Department of Justice (DOJ) to provide Congress with regular updates on the status of reported bias incidents.
Since the beginning of the crisis, there have been numerous reports of Asian-Americans being threatened, harassed, or assaulted. The pandemic has also fueled a rise in anti-Semitic incidents against the Jewish community, and has had adverse impacts on the LGBTQ community. As a result, these communities, in addition to working to combat the coronavirus, are left fighting an additional frontthat of hate and injustice.
Rose has continued to fight for and prioritize the needs of small businesses. Earlier this month, the bipartisan Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act, which Rose co-sponsored, was signed into law and included many critical fixes for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).

In Brooklyn, New York, a Chinese American woman, 89, was set on fire by two men. The woman had just left her home on July 14 when the men slapped her in the face and set her clothes on fire. She was able to rub her back against a wall to put out the flames but suffered burns.

In another attack, an Asian American, 16, was attacked at school in San Fernando Valley, California, after being accused of having the coronavirus. He suffered a concussion and was taken to the hospital.
""What's happening (to Asians) today, of course, has long historical roots,"" Lee said.

""It's part of the United States' long history of xenophobia and the irrational fear and hatred of immigrants, and, in particular, disease epidemics have always played a really important role in shaping racism in leading to hate crimes.""
A spate of hate crimes committed against Chinese has prompted the New York state Attorney-General, Letitia James, to set up a hotline to which victims can report coronavirus-related incidents. The Governor of California, Gavin Newsom, said he had seen a ""huge increase"" in assaults against Asian Americans in his state.
In an effort to document the crimes, the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council set up a website called Stop AAPI Hate on which people can report assaults. AAPI stands for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
""I want to point out how prevalent assaults are (against Chinese) in the New York area,"" Cheng said. ""It even happened to my assistant, who is Malaysian Chinese, and her partner, who were both thrown to the ground.
""Her revenge was that she got to be on the front page of the New York Post, and they did catch the assailant two months later. Another thing that I was shocked to see was that in Rockville, Maryland, most gun buyers in March were Chinese Americans. This is how afraid Americans are.""
US President Donald Trump and his allies have repeatedly been criticized for branding COVID-19 ""the Chinese virus"".
All of the panelists agreed that it was important for Asians to support each other and other ethnic groups facing racial abuse, particularly in the wake of nationwide protests over the death of George Floyd, who died in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on May 25 when a police officer knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes.

Sometime between June 8 and 16, it is believed the Islamic Center of Northern New York was burglarized. It was reported by an employee at the mosque, who added that religious items were damaged. State police are investigating.

New Jersey Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy signed a law Monday making it a crime to call 911 for the purpose of intimidating someone because of race, ethnicity, religion or gender.
The law amends an existing law and makes it a crime to falsely incriminate someone else or file a false police report as a form of bias intimidation, according to a statement on the governor's website. The bill also makes it illegal to call 911 with the purpose of harassing someone based on race or other protected class.

“Using the threat of a 9-1-1 call or police report as an intimidation tactic against people of color is an unacceptable, abhorrent form of discrimination,” Murphy said in the statement. 
“This irresponsible misuse of our 9-1-1 system places victims in a potentially dangerous situation, and can erode trust between Black and Brown New Jerseyans and law enforcement. Individuals who choose to weaponize this form of intimidation should held be accountable to the fullest extent of the law.”
Violators of the law face up to five years in prison and fines up to $15,000, according to The Hill.
Other officials have also said that false 911 calls risk escalating the situation, possibly making it deadly.
“As our country finds itself in the grips of racial and social unrest, those who seek to weaponize and enflame these tensions should be held accountable,“ said Democratic New Jersey State Senator Troy Singleton.
 “Not only are false 9-1-1 calls a waste of resources, but when they are used to harass or intimidate someone based on their race, religion, sexuality or other protected classes, they risk escalating it into a potentially deadly situation. Under this new law, anyone who files a false police report will be subject to criminal penalty,” Singleton said.
“We have seen, time and time again, the immense physical and emotional impact of weaponizing the police against Black and brown individuals. No one should fear having the police called on them simply because they are walking their dog, barbequing with friends or asking a fellow New Yorker to follow the law,” Demoratic New Jersey State Senator Shirley Turner said, likely referring to the aforementioned viral video recording the incident in New York City.
The law comes months after a viral video showing a white woman calling 911 to report a black man who asked her to put her dog on a leash in New York City's Central Park. Amy Cooper, the woman who called 911 in the video, was charged in July with a misdemeanor for filing a false report. (RELATED: New York Woman Who Called Police On Black Man While Walking Dog In Viral Video Hit With Misdemeanor)
California lawmakers passed a similar law Monday, which would make it a hate crime to call 911 to harass someone based on their race. The bill was sent to Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom for his consideration, according to the LA Times.

A renowned Japanese jazz pianist has been robbed of his ability to play his instrument after he was attacked by eight teenagers at a train station in New York City. 
Tadataka Unno, 40, who may never be able to play the piano again, was exiting the West 135th Street and St. Nicholas Avenue subway station in Harlem on September 27 when the suspects blocked the turnstiles and confronted him. 
The musician attempted to walk around the group, but was yelled at and pushed from behind. He was eventually punched in the face and body. 
According to a GoFundMe page set up on behalf of Unno by his friend Jerome Jennings, the assailants broke his right collar bone, and bruised his head and body. 
According to Unno's wife, racial slurs were also yelled during the attack. 
But police say no anti-Asian remarks were indicated in the report but the investigation is ongoing. 
Unno was rushed to Harlem Hospital where he underwent surgery on his shoulder. 
'I had no idea why I was shoved. One of them pointed at me and said, This guy just pushed me' to her peers. This was not true,' Unno told CNN. 
'One of the others said, ""She's pregnant,"" as if to imply that I had just attacked a pregnant person.' 
Unno said: 'I might never play again. 
'The trauma, both physical and mental, are severe, and I have no timeline for a full recovery.' 
Unno said he is completely unable to use his right arm following the attack. 
Jennings, an instructor at the Julliard School, and a good friend of Unno's says he is now suffering mentally and physically and is unable to play his instrument, which is his sole income. 
'He's going to need some type of cushion to not worry about it, the medical bills, and he's going to need therapy,' Jennings told CBS Local. 
On the GoFundMe page, he writes: 'My names is Jerome Jennings and I am a drummer, educator, and bandleader based out of Montclair, NJ.

Over the span of his career, Unno has played at the Kennedy Center, Village Vanguard, Dizzy's Club, and the Blue Note. 
According to his website, he has been living in New York City since 2008.
'Thank you everyone for your prayers, love and tremendous support for Tadataka and Family,' the website reads.
As of Tuesday morning, no arrests have been made, according to the NYPD. 
Authorities said they are not investigating the attack as a hate crime despite local leaders calling it 'bigotry'. 
New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer said in a tweet: 'We can't tolerate acts of hate and we must fight bigotry on all fronts. My thoughts are with Tadataka Unno and his family as he recovers.'

Michael Cremen, 48, was taken into custody on an active bench warrant.
The attorney for Cremen entered a not guilty plea on his behalf.
The Franklinville resident is due back in court for a failure to appear hearing after missing his initial court date and a subsequent re-scheduled date in October.
Erie County District Attorney John Flynn said his office requested Cremen be held for a forensic exam, but Judge Shannon Heneghan denied the request and set bail at $5,000.
During the failure to appear hearing, Flynn said he intends to present evidence and ask the judge for Cremen to be held without bail for willfully and persistently missing court which is allowed under the state's bail reform statute.
DA Flynn said the Cattaraugus County Sheriff's Office and New York State Police were called to E. Hill Road in the Town of Franklinville after a neighbor reported hearing arguing and possibly shots fired from Cremen's home.
The DA said State Police arriving on the scene reached Cremen by phone.
Flynn said he initially refused to talk or come out of the home before eventually walking down his driveway with his wife and surrendering without incident.
Cremen was then taken into custody and turned over to the Buffalo Police Department.
Flynn said State Police did not find any evidence of shots being fired inside the home.
Cremen was charged over the summer with harassment, criminal possession of a weapon and a hate crime charge of menacing for an incident that took place during a protest on Hertel Avenue.
A no-appearance warrant was issued for Cremen after he failed to show up to court for his arraignment in October.
According to a complaint filed with Buffalo Police, during an August protest, Cremen and another man were in the middle of the street at the intersection of Hertel and Parkside.

Zvezdana Drazila, 68, did not know what her attacker meant when he called her a ""cracker,"" her daughter, Dana, told the Daily News.
Drazila told detectives what her assailant said during the attack, which occurred around 2:10 p.m. Monday at the L train stop at Sixth Ave. and W. 14th St., recounted her daughter.
""That's when one of the detectives was was like, 'OK, hold on a second. This is a hate crime.' ""
Cops on Thursday released photos and video of the attacker (inset) running from the station.
Police described the suspect as between 40 and 50 years old, with a dark complexion. He was last seen wearing all-dark clothing. Police have not said whether they are investigating the incident as a hate crime.
Drazila - who for 20 years has been working for the same family as a housekeeper - was on her way home to Flushing, Queens, at around 2:10 pm Monday when the stranger approached.
""She says she saw the man go past her, but she didn't think anything if it. And then she just felt somebody push her to the ground and then he kept kicking her and stomping on her as she held on to [a] pole,"" Dana said.
""When she finally couldn't hold on ... she let go and and he shoved her into the tracks. She fell, she hit her head on the tracks,"" the daughter said.
The victim dropped her phone on the platform. The suspect grabbed it before he ran off.
Two Good Samaritans helped Drazila from the westbound tracks back onto the platform. Medics took her to Bellevue Hospital, where on Thursday she was in serious but stable condition, police said.
Drazila suffered five broken bones in her spine, a broken rib and a large knot on her head, Dana said. There was no train entering the station at the time.
""I'm not even going to mention her emotional state right now. She's traumatized, as we all are,"" the daughter said.
""She's afraid to leave the house. She's afraid to go anywhere. ... She is taking care of my sick father and his parents. They live together. She was the breadwinner in the house. How is she supposed to go back to work now?""
Dana said at first she thought her mother's attacker was just after the phone. But police later found the phone nearby - leaving the family wondering about the man's true motive.
""He didn't take the phone, he didn't take her wallet ... he didn't take anything from her,"" she said. ""Now we're thinking [he went after her] just because she was white.""
Drazila - who immigrated from Serbia in the 1960s - told her daughter she would not have survived if the Good Samaritans hadn't pulled her off the tracks.
""She just said, 'Thank God for those people.' She wishes she knew who they were to personally thank them. Because if it wasn't for them she could have been killed,"" Dana said."

Three people were arrested after paint was thrown on the Black Lives Matter mural outside Trump Tower for the second time in a week.
Juliet Germanotta, 39, D'Anna Morgan, 25, and Luis Martinez, 44, all of New York, were charged with criminal mischief and then released for covering the letters on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue with blue paint. 
A woman wearing an 'All Lives Matter' and rainbow cape was caught on video on Friday splashing the logo that was completed last week by volunteers and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio.
Another woman was busted for putting handprints on the letters that Donald Trump has called a 'symbol of hate'. 
One of the suspects told WNBC that the sign should say All Lives Matter. They were joined by a team of 10 people in a coordinated effort to deface the mural that has drawn criticism from the White House and praise from the protesters around the country. 
An unidentified 64-year-old woman also was given a summons for illegally posting fliers during the vandalism. 
The latest arrests come after another man was caught on surveillance video pouring red paint on the same mural Monday. 
Meanwhile, New York authorities are seeking the public's help in identifying the man from Monday's vandalism.
The NYPD released footage of the vandal pouring the red paint and shared that he also is wanted for criminal mischief. 
Video shows the man at approximately 12.03pm pulling the paint out of a bag as he approaches the mural on 725th 5th Avenue.
He can then be seen pouring the paint on various letters of the mural before heading off in an unknown direction. 
The suspect appears to be a white man who could be in his mid-20s or early-30s. 
Police described the vandal as being medium build and said that he was last seen wearing a black t-shirt, black shorts, black sneakers and black sunglasses.
De Blasio hit out at the person responsible on Monday night, tweeting: 'To whoever vandalized our mural on 5th Avenue: nice try @NYCDOT has already fixed it.' 
Trump Tower has been the site of dozens of protests since Donald Trump was elected - including one last Saturday where anti-racism protests clashed with MAGA fans. 
One of the witnesses to Monday's defacement was a man wearing and selling 'Dump Trump' gear on the street. 
He was pictured standing nearby a man holding up a sign seemingly intended to gaslight people highlighting racial inequalities. 
It read: 'The only time black lives matter is when they are shot by a white policeman or an Oreo cookie. Defend all policemen.'
An 'Oreo' is a derogatory term used against people of color, comparing them to the cookie which is classically brown on the outside and white on the inside. The slur suggests the person exhibits behavior that the person judging aligns with being characteristically white. 
The Black Lives Matter mural outside Trump Tower was one of five that de Blasio promised to paint across New York City last month as part of an initiative to honor civil rights activists.
'When we say ""Black Lives Matter"", there is no more American statement, there is no more patriotic statement because there is no America without Black America,' the mayor said at the time. 
'We are acknowledging the truth of ourselves as Americans by saying ""Black Lives Matter"". We are righting a wrong.' 
Trump expressed his opposition to the mural earlier this month, saying it would denigrate the luxury shopping area. He also said it would 'further antagonize New York's finest'. 
 'Maybe our GREAT Police, who have been neutralized and scorned by a mayor who hates & disrespects them, won't let this symbol of hate be affixed to New York's greatest street,' Trump tweeted on July 1. 
But police appeared to ignore the president's remarks and were seen protecting the people painting the mural from counter-protesters on Thursday. 
Black Lives Matter murals in other cities have been similarly defaced in recent weeks, including in Chicago, Milwaukee and Washington, DC. 
Last week a couple in Martinez, California, were charged with a hate crime after they destroyed a mural there. 
'We must address the root and byproduct of systemic racism in our country. The Black Lives Matter movement is an important civil rights cause that deserves all of our attention,' Contra Costa District Attorney Diana Becton said in a statement announcing the charges against David Nelson and Nicole Anderson. 
'The mural completed last weekend was a peaceful and powerful way to communicate the importance of Black lives in Contra Costa County and the country. We must continue to elevate discussions and actually listen to one another in an effort to heal our community and country.' "

Governor Andrew Cuomo said in a press conference on Saturday that the number of new coronavirus cases in New York continues to decline, with the state s death rate falling to 35 its lowest level since the crisis began.
KEY FACTS
The number of coronavirus hospitalizations, intubations and new cases were all down again on Saturday, Cuomo said, which continues to be really good news. 
New York saw its lowest death rate since the crisis began, with the daily toll falling to 35 down from 42 deaths the day before. 
Cuomo praised the declining death rate as a record low and expressed optimism that it could fall further.
All of New York s regions with the exception of New York City, which will begin reopening on June 8 are now either in Phase 1 or Phase 2 reopening.
Cuomo announced on Saturday that for regions currently in Phase 2 reopening, churches, mosques and temples can immediately reopen under 25% capacity and social distancing guidelines.
The New York governor also said he plans to sign an executive order allowing the state to prosecute anyone involved in price gouging of PPE or other medical supplies.
Crucial quote
 Compared to where we were, this is a big sigh of relief, Cuomo said on Saturday. The metrics and health data across the state are very positive. 
Key background
In his press briefing on Friday, Cuomointroducednew legislation, the Say Their Name reform agenda aimed at curtailing race-based violent policing in the wake of George Floyd s death. The legislation has four tenets: Transparency of prior disciplinary records, no chokeholds, false race-based 911 reports should be classified as hate crimes and the attorney general should act as an independent prosecutor for police murders. Cuomo said that New York should lead the wayfor police reform and urged the state s legislature to pass the bill into law next week.

Blood in the streets of urban America is a staple on weekends, and the destruction of historic statues—including Catholic ones—is spiking. While the carnage is the work of reckless thugs and left-wing activists, the tone is set by the elites: many either support these assaults or are too spineless to do anything about them.
The police across the nation are acting rationally by not extending themselves. If they do their job as expected, they risk being sued, risking sanctions that put their retirement benefits in jeopardy. The result is mayhem.
A total of 18 people were shot in New York City from mid-day Saturday through Sunday night (a tropical storm kept the killers indoors on Friday). The previous weekend, 64 were shot and 10 were killed.
In Chicago this past weekend, 64 were shot and 13 were killed. Over the previous weekend, 70 were wounded and 17 were murdered.
Other cities seeing a sharp increase in shooting and killings include Philadelphia (a 6-year-old was shot in the chest on July 5); Minneapolis (a pregnant woman was shot this past weekend); and Cleveland (an 8-year-old girl was shot over the 4th of July weekend).
Denver and Louisville have seen the murder rate increase by 40% this year as compared to last year during the same time period. On the 4th of July itself, there was a spate of killings. In Atlanta an 8-year-old girl was murdered; in Washington D.C. an 11-year-old was killed; and in San Francisco and St. Louis, 6-year-olds were murdered.
When young people aren't being killed, Catholic property is being destroyed.
Over this past weekend, a statue of Our Blessed Mother was set on fire in Boston and another statue of the Virgin Mary was vandalized in Queens, New York. In Ocala, Florida a man crashed his minivan into a Catholic church while parishioners gathered for Mass; he then poured gasoline in the church's foyer and set the church ablaze.
San Gabriel Mission Church in Los Angeles County was set on fire on July 11, destroying parts of the 249-year-old iconic structure. It was founded by Saint Junípero Serra in 1771, the priest who was a staunch defender of the rights of Indians (statues of Serra have been destroyed in many towns and cities throughout California).
Vandals were charged with a hate crime after they partially disfigured Mission San Jose, a church in Fremont, California. Swastikas and anti-Catholic comments were recently found on the graves of several Dominican friars on the campus of Providence College.
Sacred Heart Catholic school in Gallup, New Mexico was broken into last week and a statue of Jesus was vandalized. A statue outside St. John the Evangelist Catholic Church in Wasco, California was smashed last month. Church buildings were also attacked in Minnesota, New York, Kentucky, and Colorado.
This astonishing drop in respect for persons and property is the direct result of a culture turned against itself. The grievance culture is literally eating away at the social fabric. Charges of racism are everywhere, the effect of which is to dilute serious expressions of it. Claiming victim status is chic and pointing figures is the latest fad.
This kind of cultural madness will continue until and unless political and cultural leaders insist on respect for human life and the heritage of Western civilization. Unfortunately, ""The Summer of Hate"" has a long way to go.

Calling the buying and selling of animal pelts for the fashion industry ""immoral"", Gila Gamliel said Israel would outlaw the practice.
""The fur industry causes the killing of hundreds of millions of animals around the world, and involves indescribable cruelty and suffering,"" the minister from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's ruling Likud Party announced on Sunday.
""There is no need or justification for the use of furs in the fashion industry,"" Ms Gamliel said on Twitter.
Exemptions would be available for a limited number of purposes, including ""scientific research, education, for instruction and religious purposes and tradition.""
Male members of Israel's orthodox Jewish community typically wear fur hats called shtreimels on the sabbath and holidays.
The announcement was welcomed by animal rights activists. 
""Exciting news from Israel,"" said the UK branch of Humane Society International, which is campaigning to ban fur sales in the United Kingdom. 
Israeli advocacy group Animals Now said most people in the country opposed the fur trade. 
""Already at the beginning of the struggle, 86 percent of Israelis expressed a clear position that caging, torturing and brutally killing foxes, minks, dogs and cats for extravagant and unnecessary fashion items is unacceptable,"" the group said in a statement. 
""The minister's important decision will save countless animals.""
Some cities worldwide have already banned fur sales, and in October 2019 California became the first US state to do so.
When New York city considered banning fur sales last year, some Orthodox Jews opposed the proposal, despite an exemption that would allow sales on religious grounds.
""If we ban fur and then you have people that are still out there wearing it, considering the fact that hate crime in New York City is on the rise, people will be targeted on the streets, saying, 'Why are you wearing this if there's a fur ban?'"" Chaim Deutsch, an Orthodox Jew, told The New York Times.
While shtreimels are typically made from the pelts of sables, foxes or other animals, in recent years some Orthodox Jewish leaders have encouraged the wearing of synthetic fur. In 2013, Rabbi Shlomo Pappenheim said making shtreimels from animal fur violated religious prohibitions against causing unnecessary suffering to animals."

Tensions in the city remain high after months of coronavirus lockdowns, economic misery and unrest in the streets, causing petty disputes to frequently escalate quickly into violence. As well, police say that gang violence has been a major factor in the rise in shootings.
There were 152 shooting incidents across the city in September, compared to just 67 such incidents in the same month last year, a 127 percent rise, the data shows. Over the first nine months of 2020, shootings were up 91 percent.
Also last month, there were 51 murders in New York, compared to 29 in September of last year, an increase of 79 percent.
Through September 30, there were 344 murders in the city, compared to 246 murders in the first nine months of 2019, an increase of 40 percent.
Burglaries also rose an alarming 38 percent in September, and were up 42 percent for the year through September 30.
Overall, index crimes rose just 2 percent in September, with the rise in shootings and murders counter-balanced in part by declines in hate crimes (down 33 percent so far this year) and reported rapes (down 19 percent in September).
Police say that sex crimes continue to go under-reported, and urge victims to come forward by contacting the NYPD Special Victims Division.
In a press release, the NYPD touted its strong enforcement efforts, saying that gun arrests rose 98 percent in September from the same month last year.
""NYPD officers have achieved this record level of enforcement despite the approximately 2,500 officer reduction in manpower—from attrition and no new academy classes—as well as a 59 percent cut to the uniformed overtime budget,"" the department said.
Previously, Police Commissioner Dermot Shea has directly blamed Mayor Bill de Blasio's $1 billion cut to the NYPD budget for the city's recent surge in crime.
The $1 billion budget cut resulted in policing funds being reallocated to education and social services over the next year.
""You think back, crime follows certain patterns and trends. Certainly, we see upticks if violence in the summer... To have this crazy time happen this year, certainly, and leading to a defunding, it's really hurt,"" Shea told Fox Business Network last week.
""This defunding movement at a time when we know crime generally takes an upward trajectory in the summer has been a double-whammy,"" Shea added.
Shea said the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the court system and legislative factors such as bail reform had also played a role in surging crime rates.
On Friday, Shea praised the men and women of the NYPD for the sharp rise in arrests for illegal guns in September.
""Despite the unparalleled challenges they face every day, our officers continue to engage with the community and zero in on the drivers of crime,"" Shea said in a statement.
""I thank the men and women of the NYPD who work relentlessly, day-in and day-out, to keep New Yorkers in every neighborhood safe. We will continue to address crime upticks and work in close partnership with the residents we are sworn to serve,"" he added.
Across the country, most major cities have seen a sharp rise in violent crimes since late May.
On Thursday, actor Rick Moranis, 67, got an unfortunate taste of New York City's rising violence when a man punched him in the face in a shocking unprovoked sidewalk attack on the Upper West Side.
Video released by NYPD shows the ""Honey, I Shrunk The Kids"" star walking southbound on Central Park West near West 70th Street at about 7.30am on Thursday.
Suddenly, an unidentified man wearing an ""I Love NY"" hoodie strikes Moranis in the head, knocking him to the ground.
NYPD did not reveal the victim as Moranis in the public alert, but law enforcement confirmed his identity to the New York Post.

Congressman Max Rose, along with State Senator Andrew Gounardes, Council Member Justin Brannan, and the Office of Assembly Member Peter Abbate, Jr., hosted a virtual roundtable with Chinese-American community and business leaders to discuss efforts to support small businesses and the community through the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including against rising xenophobia and discrimination.
""What has been happening in the past few months in terms of skyrocketing hate crimes and xenophobia against the Chinese- and Asian-American community as a result of COVID is not only disgusting, it's reprehensible and must utilize every tool at the federal, state, and city level to crack down on it,"" Rose said. ""As we talk about the economy, there's no secret that restaurants owned by Asian-Americans were some of the first to shut down. They need our help and I'm continuing to fight to ensure they have the relief and help they need and deserve.""
During the roundtable, Rose announced his support and co-sponsorship of the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which was introduced by fellow New York City Congressmember Grace Meng. The legislation seeks to provide greater federal government oversight of COVID-19 hate crimes, and require the Department of Justice (DOJ) to provide Congress with regular updates on the status of reported bias incidents.
Since the beginning of the crisis, there have been numerous reports of Asian-Americans being threatened, harassed, or assaulted. The pandemic has also fueled a rise in anti-Semitic incidents against the Jewish community, and has had adverse impacts on the LGBTQ community. As a result, these communities, in addition to working to combat the coronavirus, are left fighting an additional front--that of hate and injustice.
Rose has continued to fight for and prioritize the needs of small businesses. Earlier this month, the bipartisan Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act, which Rose co-sponsored, was signed into law and included many critical fixes for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). Following Congress passing additional funding for relief programs to help businesses and nonprofits, Rose called on four of the leading banks to prioritize the truly small businesses that are hurting most over larger corporations and businesses. Rose also testified before the House Committee on Small Business urging more safeguards to ensure federal funding goes to small and minority-owned businesses and nonprofits that need them most.

NASCAR claimed driver Bubba Wallace was the victim of a vicious hate crime after his team found a “noose” in his garage at the Talladega speedway.
A thorough FBI investigation found that the “noose” had been there since October 2019 and was not targeting Wallace. Photos of the garage showed the rope was there to be used as a garage door pull. Instead of moving on from the incident, Wallace initially played up his alleged victimhood and doubled down in an interview with CNN's Don Lemon. It was only a day later that he released a statement saying he was glad the incident didn't turn out to be a real hate crime.

The bills, which are supported by Governor Andrew Cuomo, include 10 measures to criminalise the use of chokeholds, make police disciplinary records subject to public records, and make it a hate crime to call 911 with a false race-based accusation - a so-called ""Amy Cooper bill"" inspired by a New York City woman who was captured in widely shared footage calling police to target a black birdwatcher she had falsely claimed was threatening her.
Lawmakers also will repeal a measure in the state's civil rights laws that exempts disciplinary records of law enforcement officers from open records.
The Eric Garner Anti-Chokehold Act, named for the Staten Island man who killed during his arrest in 2014, will consider police chokeholds aggravated strangulation, which is a felony. His last words - ""I can't breathe"" - have emerged as a rallying cry in Black Lives Matter demonstrations against policy brutality.
Another piece of legislation will create a special investigations office within the state's Department of Law, under the state attorney general, to investigate and prosecute police killings.
""Protesters are basically right,"" Governor Cuomo said at his Monday press briefing. ""It's all across the globe, and people are saying enough is enough ... It's been the same point over and over again. Bring reforms to the criminal justice system. Bring reforms to policing.""
But the New York state assembly and senate houses could not agree to the terms of another bill that would require police departments to collect data for every stop they make, a measure aimed at ending racial profiling and stop-and-frisk. People who argued they were profiled and illegally stopped could then rely on that data and sue the department.
Brooklyn assemblywoman Rodneyse Bichotte said that Senate's ""watered-down"" bill is ""throwing a bone to all those who were and are victims of racial profiling"".
""The Senate believes it is too much of a burden to collect data, even though New York is lagging behind other states in this,"" she said in a statement.

Last year, state lawmakers began discussing a repeal of 50A, a nearyl 50-year-old provision in the state's civil rights statutes. Its repeal would lift a shield that protected officers with histories of misconduct and other complaints from public scrutiny.
In a statement, state Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins said: ""The horrific murder of George Floyd, the most recent in a long list of innocent people like Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Sean Reed, Tony McDade, and so many more, has led to a rightful outpouring of grief and anger ... Black New Yorkers, like all residents of this state, deserve to know that their rights, and lives, are valued and protected by our justice system.""
Other measures in the package of bills will require courts to publish racial and demographic data for low-level offences, affirm the rights of people in police custody to medical and mental health services, and mandate body-worn cameras for on-duty New York State Police officers.
 The legislation follows demands from millions of people in the streets over nearly two weeks of protests, calling for dramatic overhauls in American policing and an urgent need to dismantle systemic racism in law enforcement and other institutions.
Demonstrators have argued that policing - which cost state and local governments a combined $115 billion in 2017 - is too broken for incremental reform, and have pushed cities and states to defund or abolish local law enforcement and divert funding to historically under-funded social welfare programmes, including housing, health and education, to begin repairing conditions that create crime.
New York Mayor Bill de Blasio on Sunday announced a pledge to cut funding to his city's police force, while Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey was confronted by organisers asking whether he would commit to defund his city's police department.
A veto-proof majority of the Minneapolis City Council supports dismantling the police department and replacing it with a community-based public safety model.
 Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has vowed to cut up to $150 million budgeted to his city's police.
Democrats in Washington DC also are poised to take up federal legislation aimed at addressing police brutality by demilitarising law enforcement and adding more oversight and accountability measures."

Police advocacy groups Blue Lives Matter NYC and Standing Up for NYC have teamed up to call on NYC Mayor Bill De Blasio to paint a street mural near the New York Police Department headquarters at One Police Plaza.
The idea for a ""Blue Lives Matter"" mural was inspired by the ""Black Lives Matter"" mural that was painted on Fifth Avenue in front of Trump Tower, Blue Lives Matter NYC founder Joe Imperatrice told CNN, and would help bring attention to the dangers that police officers face every day on the street.
""I think it was a positive form of action which will give people from all walks of life an option to express themselves and bring to light issues we as a nation need to come together to fix,"" Imperatrice said of the inspiration.
""The 'Blue Lives Matter' mural would raise awareness for both the physical and verbal abuse officers endure daily. It would also be a way to remember our fallen heroes who have lost their lives defending their cities,"" Imperatrice said. ""Just as Black Lives Matter wants to bring attention to a subject, which they should, as are we.""
The Blue Lives Matter organization, a loosely affiliated group of police officers and their supporters, emerged as a counter-movement to the Black Lives Matter movement after the 2014 killings of NYPD officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu. It has inspired some state-level legislation meant to make law enforcement a protected class under hate crime laws.
Those bills were criticized in 2018 by the NAACP, ACLU and others as a ""political response"" to national calls for police reform.
De Blasio approved ""Black Lives Matter"" street mural and he even participated in painting a small portion of it after President Trump tweeted that the mural would be ""denigrating"" Fifth Avenue.
""President Trump said we would be denigrating the luxury of Fifth Avenue,"" De Blasio said in response to Trump's tweet. ""Let me tell you: we're not denigrating anything, we are liberating Fifth Avenue, we are uplifting Fifth Avenue.""

and if the results were positive, then the information will be revealed on the internet, without the name, but just enough information for people to guess who these people are. I can see the struggle for you here because you are talking about risk, you're talking about a risk to public health if people don't give their but you are also talking about a risk of being outed. Are you feeling a real struggle there, or do some people have a real struggle with this? For being out and proud activists and artists, but there are a lot of friends of mine, even artists or activists who work for LGBTQ organisations, many of them are not out, and they still have to lie about their sexuality or sexual orientation to their family, their parents. 
Heezy Yang, before coronavirus, do you think things were getting easier? When you talk about Pride gatherings and parades in Seoul, for example, was that possible, were those gatherings getting bigger before the virus? In general, things seemed to be going well, and going towards the right direction because Seoul Pride had been going to the festival for about 10 years now, and the first time I went there, the size of it was approximately 2,000 or 3,000 people but last year, they had over 120,000 people so the size of it has become really big, in general, and mainstream media, and K-pop even included, not, like, very out and loud more queer and LGBTQ factors and culture little by little, so things seemed to be going to the right direction but then this one outbreak happened and people had to face, they had to face the fact that things weren't actually as good as they seemed or there have always been problems. Heezy Yang in South Korea. You are watching Coronavirus: Your Stories. I'm Philippa Thomas and we are looking this week at virus and prejudice. Next, a young photographer in New York City sees a rise in abuse directed at Asian-American basis. So I was waiting in line to enter a grocery store a day after the shelter-in-place order was officially announced here in New York City, and there were clear signs for social distancing but the man behind me was hovering right behind me so close to the point where I could almost feel his breath, and he didn't have a mask on. I politely asked him for some space to which he responded, ""What did you say to me, chink?"" And proceeded to cut in front of me. At this point, I was already anticipating an increase in hate crimes against Asian-Americans to a Chinese virus about four days prior to my incident but I wanted to believe my experience was kind of an isolated incident since I live in such a racially and culturally diverse city like New York City. So Haruka, that happened to you, and then you start asking around and realise this isn't an isolated incident? Right, so I started to realise that there was a pattern of these incidents and I started to do some research, I found several Facebook groups where Asian-Americans were self-reporting incidents of racial aggression via text and video, and I also came across some advocacy organisations like Chinese for Affirmative Action that compiled a virtual map of aggravated incident reports from Asian-Americans who had experienced racial aggressions across the US, and this virtual map already included up to 1,000 cases by the time I was conducting the research, but that number currently surpasses 1,500. Interestingly enough, the NYPD hate crimes statistics summary at this point included only one report of a hate crime directed towards Asians at this point, so as you can imagine, the numbers weren't really adding up and I was shocked to hear the statistics, to be honest. Underreporting has always been an ongoing issue within our community but I also felt like if we didn't bring public attention to this issue, our experiences would be confined to these online spaces and never be taken seriously unless we did the documenting ourselves. So let's look at some of the documenting."

Saying that there are reports of other heinous rape crimes again on dalit girls in Balrampur and other places, the organizations have demanded “immediate prosecution of the criminals under the SC/ST Atrocities Act”. “As per the National Crime Records Bureau statistics, the crimes against dalits rose by 746% from 2006 to 2016. The caste motivated rapes and murders of dalit women form major proportion of such crimes. The cases pending investigations were up 99% and the police were half as likely to help,” the statement reads.
The organizations wanted the government to take initiatives along with the community leaders to eradicate caste hate, restore law and order in UP and country and “create a safer space for women, and provide equal opportunities to all its citizens along with additional safeguards for the scheduled castes and tribes”.

 A San Francisco official introduced an ordinance on Tuesday called the CAREN Act that would impose fines on anyone who makes false and racially discriminatory emergency reports in the city, in response to recent heavily publicized incidents in which white people have called the police on innocent Black people.
KEY FACTS
The CAREN Act, or the Caution Against Racially Exploitative Non-Emergencies Act, was introduced by San Francisco Supervisor Shamann Walton and is a reference to Karen, which has become a generic name to describe entitled or racist white women.
Making a false report is already a crime, but the bill would amend the San Francisco Police Code to make it unlawful for someone to fabricate a report based on someone s race, ethnicity, religious affiliation, gender or sexual orientation.
The bill would allow the person who was the subject of the call to seek civil remedy through the courts, Natalie Gee, Walton s chief of staff, toldForbes.
California Assemblyman Rob Bontaintroduceda bill last month that would make discriminatory 911 calls a hate crime in the state. 
Crucial quote
 Within the last month and a half in the Bay Area, an individual called the police on a Black man who was dancing and exercising on the street in his Alameda neighborhood and a couple called the police on a Filipino man stenciling Black Lives Matter in chalk in front of his own residence in San Francisco s Pacific Heights, a press release announcing the bill said.
Key background
Several viral Karen moments have taken place in San Francisco. In 2018,Alison Ettel, who is white, called the police on an 8-year-old girl who was selling water on the sidewalk without a permit, earning Ettel the nickname Permit Patty. And more recently, a white couple went viral last month forcallingthe neighborhood police watch on a Filipino-American neighbor for writing Black Lives Matter in chalk in front of his house while demanding to know if he actually lived there. 
News peg
Amy Cooper, a white woman who called the police on a Black man after he asked her to keep her dog leashed in Central Park, waschargedMonday with falsely reporting an incident in the third degree, which is punishable with up to a year in jail. Though New York is debating statewide legislation that would make racially biased 911 calls a hate crime, the charges announced Monday do not take into account any racial bias.

CNN's Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo mocked “ring-wing” media for reporting on rising crime in major cities, suggesting that the reports come when President Donald Trump's “poll numbers go south.”
The two spoke briefly at the start of Lemon's “CNN Tonight” show Tuesday evening. The hand-off started with a discussion about two Californians who have been charged with a hate crime for trying to paint over a “Black Lives Matter” street mural.
Cuomo quickly pivoted, trashing those around Trump and people concerned with what the BLM movement really stands for. He told Lemon that “it's all about creating division” and called out “state TV” for allegedly pushing this narrative.
“It all fits together, D,” Cuomo said. “The lies about the pandemic. The lies about, you know, what this President will make happen, the lies of those around him echo of support. Lies about what Black Lives Matter is about. It's all about creating division. And making, you know, in a country that is well over 70 percent white, if this happens, it is bad for you.”
Lemon responded by trashing the “the right-wing machine” and “media” for its reporting amid the BLM movement. The two CNN hosts then began to mock reporting from right-wing media, lowering their voices as they did so.
“Democratic cities are in chaos right now. Is this what you want from Joe Biden? And they're gonna take your country away. And they're taking down the statues,” Lemon said.
WATCH:
“Crime is rising!” Cuomo replied sarcastically, followed up by Lemon repeating his comment.
“Defund police!” Cuomo added.
“Oh my gosh! It's so bad and they get defunding the police,” Lemon continued. “And it's like - And the people who you saw there for the most part, not, not them specifically. I'm talking about as a whole. Fall for it. They fall for it and that's why they do things like what they did. They want to paint over signs and think 'it's our country.'”
The duo did not discuss numerous reports from various publications regarding rising crime in major cities. The New York Times reported June 23 on the rising gun violence in New York City, pointing out that “it has been nearly a quarter century since New York City experienced as much gun violence in the month of June as it has seen this year.”
In Los Angeles, the LAPD reported that homicides were up by 250% between May 31 and June 6 compared to the week prior, according to a June 9 report from CBS Los Angeles. Victims who were shot also increased 56%, according to the report.
The duo made no mention of the multiple children who have been shot - and some killed - amid growing violence across the country. (RELATED: 16 Children Have Been Shot, Some Killed, In Cities Across The US As Violence Spikes)
Lemon and Cuomo also ignored discussing warnings about the BLM movement, instead opting to trash those who are pushing “lies” about what the movement is about. Actor Terry Crews tried to discuss issues surrounding some people leading the movement on CNN just one day earlier. Crews noted that the movement has hints of extremism to it and pointed out that black-on-black crime doesn't seem to matter to them.

231,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1/Files (250).DOCX","States News Service",2020-12-23,"738 words",NA,"States News Service",NA,"ANTISEMITISM IS ON THE RISE IN MICHIGAN. ALL OF US CAN FIGHT IT.",FALSE,"The following information was released by the American Jewish Committee (AJC):
By Rabbi Asher Lopatin and Lauren Herrin
Hate is ever present in our society. We have all seen it on television, social media, flyers and banners, as well as through abhorrent actions such as assault and murder. High profile incidents make the news. But many may not realize that these hate-fueled acts are happening far more than we think, and at an increasing pace.
Recently, the FBI released ""Hate Crime Statistics, 2019,"" an annual report of bias-motivated incidents throughout the United States.
The data, submitted by more than 15,500 law enforcement agencies, provides information about the offenses, victims, offenders and locations of hate crime incidents. But since reporting is not mandatory, it is likely that the numbers are actually higher.
This year's report is especially worrying to American Jews.
Of the 1,715 religious-based incidents, 60.2% targeted Jews, who make up less than 2% of the country's population. This is four-and-a-half times more than hate crimes committed against the next most-targeted community, those of the Muslim faith, at 13.2%. The report also showed that hate incidents targeting Jews were up 14% compared to the prior year.
Of the total incidents reported in the category, 51 occurred in Michigan and, thankfully, were nonviolent. While this number may seem relatively low, it is five times more than we would expect based on the percentage of Jews who live in Michigan, 1% of the state's population.
The FBI data may not be shocking to some. As Jews, we have watched in horror as marchers with tiki torches spewed hate in Charlottesville in 2017. We wept upon learning of the senseless massacres in Pittsburgh in 2018, and in Poway, Calif.; Jersey City, New Jersey; and Monsey, New York, in 2019.
In Michigan, Jews have seen hateful flyers posted on the gates of cemeteries and in local cities. Last year, a Nazi flag was found flying at an elementary school in Battle Creek.
As the FBI's statistics bear out, antisemitism is thriving.
On the second commemoration of the Tree of Life shooting in late October, American Jewish Committee, of which our organization, Jewish Community Relations Council/AJC, is a regional office, issued its State of Antisemitism in America 2020: Survey of American Jews and Survey of the General Public. Among its many other findings, 88% of Jews found antisemitism to be a problem in the United States today, but only 62% of the general public agreed. More awareness and education are necessary.
What can we do to curb these frightening numbers against not only Jews, but all groups facing hate?
The first step is to report hate crimes. Make the proper authorities police, FBI and community organizations aware. This will help not only catch the perpetrator, but also will help keep such incidents from happening in the future by making sure they are properly listed as acts of hate.
Second, specifically regarding acts of hate against Jews and the Jewish community, is to better understand what antisemitism means. JCRC/AJC, along with other organizations across the country and around the world, are working with local, state and national bodies to recognize the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance Working Definition of Antisemitism, which includes important illustrations of how antisemitism manifests.
Next, advocate against hate by urging the U.S. Senate to pass the Jabara-Heyer National Opposition to Hate, Assaults and Threats to Equality, or NO HATE, Act before the approaching end of this congressional session.
This legislation will, among other things, incentivize state and local law enforcement authorities to improve hate crime reporting by making grants available for resources such as reporting hotlines and law enforcement training. Please become a voice against hate, and feel free to contact JCRC/AJC with your own ideas on how to fight this growing scourge in our community.
Finally, come together in alliances with different communities to hear each other's experiences with hate and discrimination. This will help your understanding of your ally's particular fear of the hate they are experiencing, such as antisemitism.
If everyone works together, perhaps the numbers reported for 2021 and beyond will show a downward trend.

""When an army tried to invade the city, the design of the gate made it that you can't just barge right in. You have to turn,"" said Cahn, executive director of Romemu, a nondenominational group associated with the Jewish Renewal movement. ""To get to the Romemu sanctuary, you have to go into a vestibule and then turn and go down a short hallway. Much like the Israelites, it allows us to delay anybody getting in.""
Romemu, which meets on the Upper West Side, didn't always have such an intricate entry point. ""It used to just be one guard who would check bags at the entrance, and that was it. Our security was mostly just symbolic,"" Cahn told The Jerusalem Post.
That changed two years ago following the deadliest attack against Jews on American soil. On October 27, 2018, a virulent antisemite stormed the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, murdering 11 congregants at Shabbat morning services.
Last week marked the two-year anniversary of the massacre, which left the Jewish world reeling and security officials across the country facing an urgent task of improving safety at a time of rising antisemitism in New York and nationwide.
""Jewish communities in North America have already been subject to violent and deadly attacks over the last two years, often by lone actors who provided little warning and spent hours in online spaces steeped in violent antisemitism,"" said Mitchell Silber, executive director of Community Security Initiative (CSI) and a former senior NYPD counterterrorism official. ""The trends and data that we track suggest that we remain in a heightened threat environment.""
CSI is a new program created in early 2020 as part of UJA and Jewish Community Relations Council of NY's more than $4 million plan to help secure local Jewish institutions in the New York region.
Last year, New York City and environs, with the largest Jewish population in the US, was the site of several extremist attacks, including at a Jersey City kosher supermarket and in the home of a prominent rabbi in Monsey in December.
The year 2020 brought additional obstacles as fear of the novel coronavirus pandemic rippled into places of worship, changing the way religious groups gather to pray and creating additional cybersecurity issues, as well as physical protection. Conspiracy theories circulated claiming that COVID-19 is a tool to enhance Jewish influence. Jews remain at the top of the FBI's list of religious groups most frequently targeted for hate crimes according to the annual Hate Crime Statistics Act report.
When The Prospect Heights Shul - a modern Orthodox congregation in Brooklyn - reopened this summer for outdoor services, Rabbi Jonathan Leener confronted a wide array of new security challenges.
""After Pittsburgh, we made it a priority to have armed security at any significant event like Purim or the High Holy Days,"" Leener told the Post. Federal Homeland Security grants helped pay for guards and security technology upgrades.
""Now, COVID poses a unique security challenge, as we have started davening [praying] outside in a vacant parking lot,"" Leener told the Post.
He said since resuming services, there has been one ""unfortunate encounter"" from a neighborhood passerby.
""It wasn't anything threatening, but it was a comment which certainly made me feel uncomfortable. It basically reinforced that we need to have security,"" he said. Leener encourages his congregants not to publicly post information about services, but rather to keep the details private in WhatsApp or email groups.
ROMEMU WAS the first synagogue in New York to completely shut down its physical presence in early March before pandemic cases skyrocketed in the city. Like many non-Orthodox congregations, they are still running services entirely online.
""In a practical sense, the target no longer exists,"" Cahn said. ""We don't have anybody gathered on a Friday or Saturday, much less 500 people.""
""All of our security concerns at this moment are about online security,"" Cahn continued. ""We have put into place sophisticated security controls on Zoom and have added certain people to our security watch list. People always say to me 'it must be cheaper to run an online synagogue,' but it's not. The people who would have been setting up chairs and cleaning the sanctuary, we are now paying to moderate Zoom calls.""
Following the Pittsburgh attack, there has been a surge in American Jews being trained by groups like Community Security Service (CSS) on identifying and responding to suspicious activity in order to preempt attacks.
""Since Pittsburgh, we have put more than one thousand community members through our training. We have definitely witnessed a spike in interest, including dozens of synagogues across the country that began after Pittsburgh, and currently have new institutions reaching out to us consistently. Even during the pandemic, there is increased interest from both institutions and volunteers to become more involved and ensure the safest possible environment for their respective communities,"" said Evan Bernstein, CEO of CSS, a volunteer safety-training program founded in 2007 by military and law enforcement veterans.
In September, CSS announced an operational partnership with CSI that will synchronize field operations, coordinate deployments of volunteers, share intelligence, and conduct joint training. The collaboration will cover Jewish institutions in New York City, Long Island and Westchester.
""There's more that we need to take into account now,"" Bernstein told the Post, ""like the location of outdoor services. Some are closer to the street, some of the minyanim are in front of the synagogue building which makes them even more exposed. These are differences that our teams never had to deal with in the past.""
Looking ahead, Romemu's Cahn said he is preparing for the security concerns that will come with the end of lockdown. ""All of this is very temporary and we expect to be back in the building,"" he told the Post.
He said his top priorities to enhance congregational security for 2021 are ""screening procedures for people coming into the building, physical hardening of the facility doors and training of staff and congregants on how to respond to emergencies.""
""As Jewish institutions, we are by no means alone in this current climate of being targets for fanatics, extremists and nutcases. Churches have had a lot more attacks. I don't feel special in any way,"" Cahn continued.
""But like a good Jew, I hold that notion in one hand - and in the other hand, as Jews, we need to be especially vigilant. Lest we imagine for one second that we are just like everyone else in terms of the hate directed against us; we cannot let our guard down for one second.""

Swastika is an unincorporated area within Black Brook, a small town located in Clinton County.

The board discussed the name for about five minutes before voting unanimously to keep it, NCPR reported.
Douglass acknowledged that many in the U.S. think of the swastika in terms of its association with white supremacy, but he told NCPR, ""I believe there are others that do not associate it with hate."" Douglass pointed to the Hindu and Buddhist religions, both of which have used a version of the swastika icon to represent spirituality. The symbol in Sanskrit that is used in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism means ""well-being,"" according to the BBC.
Swastika's original settlers decided on the name in the 1800s, and those who lived there in the wake of World War II defended the name for its original meaning, Douglass told NCPR. ""Some of the residents that were from that area actually fought in World War II and refused to change the name just because Hitler tried to tarnish the meaning of swastika,"" he said.
The World Hindu Council of America (VHPA)'s American Hindus Against Defamation (AHAD) initiative has in recent months argued in favor of differentiating between the swastika used as a ""sacred symbol"" and the version used by Nazis, known as the Nazi Hakenkreuz. In July, the AHAD encouraged the New York Senate to make the distinction clear while considering a new piece of legislation, which proposed requiring ""New York school children be educated regarding the meaning of swastikas and nooses as symbols of hatred and intolerance.""
The proposed legislation would ""perpetuate ignorance and promotes HinduPhobia in schools across New York state,"" AHAD Convenor Ajay Shah said in a statement.
The AHAD's statement went on to say that identifying the differences between swastikas used in religion and the version used by white supremacists was important in embracing cultural diversity.
""To label the Swastika as a symbol of hate would be a grave insult to 1.8 billion Hindus and Buddhists around the world,"" the AHAD said. ""Maligning this ancient heritage would be a step backwards in promoting interfaith harmony and would lead to increase in hate crimes and Hinduphobia.""
Newsweek reached out to Douglass and the AHAD for comment.

The New York chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-NY), the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, today condemned the covering of Black Lives Matter (BLM) signs with stickers containing white supremacist messages all over New Rochelle, Westchester County.
According to NBC New York, BLM signs have been disappearing or have been covered by white supremacist stickers causing some citizens to abstain from their daily routines out of apprehension for their family’s safety. One example of the posted stickers read “White children are already a minority. Take back our future.” Stickers can be found on traffic signs, mailboxes, and tennis courts, among other publicly visible locations.

CAIR-NY also decried the hateful messages sent to Congresswoman Grace Meng after a resolution in the House was passed to denounce anti-Asian bigotry. On Friday, September 25th, Representative Meng stated that just after her resolution against ant-Asian sentiment passed, she began receiving insulting voicemails ranging from ignorant comments to enraged threats. Messages also repeated racist remarks used by President Trump to blame Asian Americans for Covid-19, such as terms like “KungFlu.”

In a statement, CAIR-NY Executive Director Afaf Nasher said:
“The racist vitriol that targets one community often targets many communities. Whether it’s a quiet Westchester neighborhood or the halls of Congress, white supremist ideology and anti-Black racism in general threatens those who dare show support toward Black and Asian American lives. However, targeted communities and their allies will not cease to band together in a protective and firm stand against hatred. Evil cannot, and will not, win.”
CAIR-NY regularly affirms its unwavering stance against racism targeting diverse marginalized communities.

There was a spike in anti-Muslim hate crimes after 9/11 and the US invaded two majority Muslim countries, launching a global war on terror that's killed hundreds of thousands of people. In short, Krugman's tweets were ahistorical.

And 15 years after 9/11, Americans elected a president who called for banning all Muslims from the US.The US also invaded Afghanistan within a month of the attacks, launching the longest war in US history (and it's not over yet). The US then invaded Iraq in 2003 (US troops are also still there), which was ultimately disastrous and helped foster the rise of ISIS.The US has conducted counterterrorism operations in 80 countries, according to Brown University's Costs of War project[9], and America's ""global war on terror"" has displaced at least 37 million people and killed over 800,000. The federal price tag for the so-called war on terror stands at $6.4 trillion, and though Osama bin Laden and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi are both dead, neither al Qaeda nor ISIS have been totally defeated.People were tortured by the US government after 9/11, and held indefinitely without being charged with a crime at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba.

Defunding the Hate Violence Prevention Initiative and Cutting Social Services by 20% Without Cutting the NYPD Budget is a Disgrace.
At the close of Pride month, amid protests against anti-Black police violence, an ongoing global pandemic, and a financial crisis; the New York City Council passed an austerity budget that cut essential funding from many progams serving LGBTQ Black and other people of color and failed to meaningfully divest from the NYPD. The New York City Council passed this budget despite calls to #DefundNYPD. Just days before this budget's passage, police violently attacked protesters marching in the Queer Liberation March for Black Lives, pushing, beating, and using pepper spray against them toward the end of the march in Washington Square Park. This and many other incidents, starting with the Stonewall police rebellion in 1969, illustrate why LGBTQ people are fighting to #DefundNYPD.
The FY21 budget Council passed on June 30th includes devastating cuts to essential services for those most vulnerable -- Black and other people of color communities -- but no meaningful cuts from the NYPD FY21 expense budget. Communities United for Police Reform, a coalition of which AVP has been a voting member since it was founded in 2012, called for at least $1 billion to be cut from the NYPD and to be reinvested back into Black, indigenous, people of color (BIPOC) communities which have been severely impacted by COVID-19. Instead, the FY21 adopted budget cut nearly 20% of discretionary funding that should go directly to community organizations serving marginalized New Yorkers, while protecting significant portions of the NYPD budget. For instance, while all other city agencies are experiencing a hiring freeze, the NYPD is expected to start training a new class of officers in the fall. And through a budgetary sleight of hand, funding for school safety officers was not cut but moved from the NYPD budget to the Department of Education. This budget cuts services and incentivizes over-policing of our communities; it represents dangerous steps backwards from our progress towards safety.
We acknowledge the nine NYC Council members who voted their conscience by voting no on the FY21 budget, recognizing that the NYPD cuts were achieved through budgetary tricks and not a real reduction to officer headcount, or any other meaningful change in priorities to protect vulnerable New Yorkers: Council Members Barron, Kallos, Lander, Menchaca, Reynoso, Rivera, Richards, Rosenthal, and Van Bramer.
ne creative solution, the Hate Crimes Prevention Initiative, established in FY20, has been completely defunded in the FY21 budget. The initiative was conceptualized and advocated for by AVP along with eight other community-based organizations working across identities and communities. Jewish, Arab-American, Muslim, LGBTQ, and Black and Brown New Yorkers united to create community safety, working together to make New York safer through bystander/upstander education, reporting and support for survivors, rapid incident response, and restorative justice frameworks.
The initiative aimed to create pathways to communal responsibility and education -- as opposed to police arrests for hate crimes -- to address violence. It is unconscionable that the Council would cut such an initiative in a budget cycle when the need to prevent hate violence is so dire, as well as the imprative to end the escalating police violence against Black, brown, queer and trans communities.
AVP has supported the #DefundNYPD movement because the LGBTQ and HIV-affected survivors of violence we serve, especially Black people and trans, gender non-conforming, and non-binary people of color, have historically been profiled and targeted by law enforcement. In addition to the escalating police violence against LGBTQ people protesting, in daily life, police do not make our communities safer. Instead, they escalate and perpetrate violence against those most vulnerable, particularly when called upon to intervene with New Yorkers experiencing crises, like those related to mental health and homelessness, all of which disproportionately impact BIPOC and LGBTQ communities. AVP believes in a different approach to create safety, one that doesn't include increased policing, but relies on communities to know what they need to be safe and receive the funding needed to implement creative solutions.
AVP opposes this budget which fails to decrease the size of the NYPD and its daily violent impact on LGBTQ people's lives, whilst also delivering cuts to alternative safety programs and resources that actually help build a safer world for LGBTQ survivors of violence. We will continue to fight for resources for our community and #DefundNYPD.

Amid a nationwide reckoning over race in the wake of the death of George Floyd, a disturbing number of reports have cropped up featuring an icon of violent oppression from the days of Jim Crow: the noose. In addition to the widely publicized case of a noose discovered in the garage stall ofNASCAR driverBubba Wallace on Sunday, nooses have been found in public places in California, New York and Maine within the last week, and over the previous month, six black peoplehave been found hanging from trees, with their deaths ruled suicides.
KEY FACTS
Last Tuesday, the Oakland Police Departmentannouncedit had opened up a hate crime investigation after officers found a total of five nooses hanging from trees, which were turned into the FBI as evidence.
A local residentcame forwardto say he had hung them to serve as exercise equipment months ago.
The following day, a fake body hanging from a noose was located near the same area.
Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaftweeteda statement on Thursday saying the effigy was a deliberate and vile attempt to traumatize and divide Oaklanders. 
On Friday, Juneteeth, a noose was discovered hanging from a telephone line in Deer Isle, Maine,reportedlynext to a White Lives Matter sign.
At Sunday s race at Alabama s Talladega Superspeedway, the first since NASCAR s ban on the Confederate flag, a noose was found in the garage of Bubba Wallace, the only Black driver in the competition.
Over the last four weeks, six black people have beenfound deadfrom separate hangings in Georgia, Maine, California, Oregon and New York.
Authorities have maintained that all of thesedeaths appearto be suicides, but family members of some of the deceased disagree.
Key Background:
After originally saying there was no sign of foul play in either of the two hanging deaths in California (which were separated by just 50 miles and occurred 10 days apart), the local authorities, responding to pleasfrom community activists, promised full investigations into the deaths of both men. The FBI is also monitoring the inquiries. Family members of 38-year-old Malcolm Harsch, one of the two men, saidSaturday that after reviewing video footage provided by the police, they were now convinced that he died by suicide. However, family members of the other individual, 24-year-old Robert Fuller, are still waiting for the results of an investigation into his death. 
Tangent:
Last Thursday, on the eve of Juneteenth, a pair of Bronx residentssaidthey discovered multiple nooses in a nearby park. The NYPD reportedlyclaimed the hanging knots were nothing more than harmless string and declined to open an investigation. A noose was also found hanging from a tree inside Harlem s Marcus Garvey Park on June 13. This incident prompted Gov. Andrew Cuomo to promise that the New York State Police Hate Crimes Task Force would investigate. Yet, the task force quickly determinedthat it was not an act of hate, but instead that the noose was left over from a construction scaffold removed in the fall, used to hoist construction materials.
Critical Quote: 
 It is very uncommon for young black men to commit suicide, let alone by hanging, saidRaymond Winbush, a psychologist and the director of Morgan State University s Institute for Urban Research. (The overall suicide rate for African Americans is 60% lowerthan that of the non-Hispanic white population, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.)

Minutes after political commentator Angela Rye dismissed[1] Thomas Jefferson as no different than rapper R. Kelly, far-left hosts Chris 'Fredo' Cuomo and Don Lemon dismissed, giggled about, and mocked the idea that there's rising crime in major cities, including outbreaks of gun violence.In other words, Cuomo and Lemon chose to cast as fake news the deadly gun violence that's lead to the recent deaths of young African-Americans like Horace Lorenzo Anderson Jr.[2], Davon McNeal[3], and Secoriea Turner[4] in Seattle, Washington D.C., and Atlanta, respectively.During the hand-off to Lemon's CNN Tonight, the two were discussing hate charges being filed[5] against a California man and womanfor trying to paint over a Black Lives Matter street mural when Cuomo began making a broader point lumping together anyone and everyone who's not fully invested with the BLM movement. '[I]t all fits together, D.The lies about the pandemic.The lies about, you know, what thisPresident will make happen thelies of those around him echo ofsupport.Lies about what Black LivesMatter is about.It's all about creatingdivision.

New York authorities are seeking the public's help in identifying a man who poured red paint on the Black Lives Matter mural in front of Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan. 
The NYPD released footage of the vandal pouring the red paint on Monday and shared that he is wanted for criminal mischief. 
Video shows the man at approximately 12.03pm pull the paint out of a bag as he approaches the mural on 725th 5th Avenue.
He can then be seen pouring the paint on various letters of the mural before heading off in an unknown direction. 
The suspect appears to be a white man who could be in his mid-20s or early-30s. 
Police described the vandal as being medium build and said that he was last seen wearing a black t-shirt, black shorts, black sneakers and black sunglasses.
The mural was painted last week by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and local community activists.
De Blasio hit out at the person responsible on Monday night, tweeting: 'To whoever vandalized our mural on 5th Avenue: nice try @NYCDOT has already fixed it.' 
Trump Tower has been the site of dozens of protests since Donald Trump was elected - including one on Saturday where anti-racism protests clashed with the president's supporters at the new mural. 
One of the witnesses to Monday's defacement was a man wearing and selling 'Dump Trump' gear on the street. 
He was pictured standing nearby a man holding up a sign seemingly intended to gaslight people highlighting racial inequalities. It read: 'The only time black lives matter is when they are shot by a white policeman or an Oreo cookie. Defend all policemen.'
An 'Oreo' is a derogatory term used against people of color, comparing them to the cookie which is classically brown on the outside and white on the inside. The slur suggests the person exhibits behavior that the person judging aligns with being characteristically white. 
The Black Lives Matter mural outside Trump Tower was one of five that de Blasio promised to paint across New York City last month as part of an initiative to honor civil rights activists.
'When we say ""Black Lives Matter"", there is no more American statement, there is no more patriotic statement because there is no America without Black America,' the mayor said at the time. 
'We are acknowledging the truth of ourselves as Americans by saying ""Black Lives Matter"". We are righting a wrong.' 
Trump expressed his opposition to the mural earlier this month, saying it would denigrate the luxury shopping area. He also said it would 'further antagonize New York's finest'. 
 'Maybe our GREAT Police, who have been neutralized and scorned by a mayor who hates & disrespects them, won't let this symbol of hate be affixed to New York's greatest street,' Trump tweeted on July 1. 
But police appeared to ignore the president's remarks and were seen protecting the people painting the mural from counter-protesters on Thursday. 
Black Lives Matter murals in other cities have been similarly defaced in recent weeks, including in Chicago, Milwaukee and Washington, DC. 
Last week a couple in Martinez, California, were charged with a hate crime after they destroyed a mural there. 
'We must address the root and byproduct of systemic racism in our country. The Black Lives Matter movement is an important civil rights cause that deserves all of our attention,' Contra Costa District Attorney Diana Becton said in a statement announcing the charges against David Nelson and Nicole Anderson. 
'The mural completed last weekend was a peaceful and powerful way to communicate the importance of Black lives in Contra Costa County and the country. We must continue to elevate discussions and actually listen to one another in an effort to heal our community and country.' 
The decision to paint the murals came as Americans across the country expressed their hurt at statues and memorials to Confederate soldiers and slave-owners that have loomed over public places for decades. 
Trump recently signed an executive order that would see anyone found to have tampered with a statue or monument face up to 10 years in prison. "

He does not know how long it will take to fully recover or when he will be able to start playing the piano again, according to the pianist.
Unno was on his way home from work on the evening of Sept. 27, when he was attacked by a group of about eight young men and women, who accused him of touching the body of one of them.

Meanwhile, a crowdfunding launched by a friend of Unno to support the pianist raised some 90,000 dollars.

U.S. Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Rob Portman (R-OH), Gary Peters (D-MI), James Lankford (R-OK), and Jacky Rosen (D-NV) sent a letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee today requesting that the Nonprofit Security Grant Program be adequately funded to meet the needs of at-risk organizations this fiscal year. The funding allocated by this program will support non-profit organizations most at risk of terror attacks through the acquisition and installation of physical target hardening measures, related preparedness and prevention planning, training, and exercises, and contracted security personnel so that religious and community-based organizations have the critical resources and tools they need to protect lives and property. According to a recent FBI report on hate crime statistics in 2019, 60.2 percent were victims of crimes motivated by offenders' anti-Jewish bias.

""The Nonprofit Security Grant Program is an initiative committed to keeping nonprofits deemed at risk of terrorist attacks safer through critical investments in their physical security.

Every year, Congress must specifically allocate funding for the NSGP.

In addition to hardening facilities, this program has improved efforts to keep at-risk nonprofit organizations safe by promoting emergency preparedness coordination and collaboration activities between public and private community representatives, as well as with state and local government agencies.
For years, Senator Gillibrand has successfully pushed to include funding for the NSGP in the budget. In 2019, Gillibrand and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer successfully fought to secure $90 million in funding for the NSGP, a $30 million increase from 2018. The Jewish community remains the top target of faith-based hate crimes in the U.S. for the 23rd consecutive year, and Senator Gillibrand will continue to prioritize the safety of these communities throughout New York State.

To: The Honorable Richard Shelby, Chairman, Senate Appropriations, United States Senate, Washington, DC 20510
The Honorable Shelley Moore Capito, Chairwoman, Senate Appropriations, Subcommittee on Homeland Security, United States Senate, Washington, DC 20510
The Honorable Patrick Leahy, Ranking Member, Senate Appropriations, United States Senate, Washington, D.C. 20510
The Honorable Jon Tester, Ranking Member, Senate Appropriations, Subcommittee on Homeland Security, United States Senate, Washington, D.C. 20510
Dear Chairmen Shelby and Capito, Vice Chairman Leahy, and Ranking Member Tester,
Thank you for your continued support for the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP) under the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) and the State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP). As you finalize the Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 Homeland Security Appropriations bill, we respectfully ask you to fund NSGP at the funding level that reflects increased risks to the nonprofit sector. Presently, the House and Senate drafts are far apart on recommended levels of funding for the program. The House top line is $360 million and the Senate's $90 million. During conference, we urge you to ensure the NSGP is appropriately funded to meet the needs of at-risk populations. At a time of heightened threat to nonprofit faith- and community-based organizations, a bolstered NSGP will continue to provide our nonprofit partners with critical resources and tools they need to protect lives and property.
The NSGP provides for grants to nonprofits deemed at risk of terrorist (or violent extremist) attack, to acquire and install physical security enhancements, conduct preparedness planning, training and exercises, and contract security personnel. The program has improved efforts to keep at-risk nonprofit organizations safe by promoting emergency preparedness coordination and collaboration between public and private community representatives as well as state and local government agencies. Today's quickly evolving threat environment provides a compelling public interest in protecting against attacks on the nonprofit sector that would disrupt the vital health, human, social, cultural, religious, and other humanitarian services and practices they provide to communities, and which threaten the lives and well-being of millions of Americans who operate, utilize, live, and work in proximity to them.
At the beginning of this year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Homeland Security and National Counterterrorism Center jointly assessed that Domestic Violent Extremists and Racially/Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremists (RMVEs) will continue to pose a lethal threat to faith-based communities, particularly the Jewish community, and remain concerned about the difficulty of detecting lone offenders due to the individualized nature of the radicalization process./1 During a recent Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearing on threats to the Homeland, FBI Director Christopher Wray testified that the number one threat the nation faces from domestic violent extremists stems from RMVEs, who are considered the most lethal of all domestic extremists in the post-911 environment./2 To illustrate his point, Director Wray recounted the arrest last November of Richard Holzer on federal domestic terrorism and hate crime charges for attempting to blow up a historic synagogue in Pueblo, Colorado and provoke ""a racial holy war.""/3
Additionally, according to the latest FBI Hate Crime Statistics 2019 report,/4which was released earlier this month, reported hate crimes motivated by religious bias increased by 100 to a total of 1,650 in 2019, of which more than 60 percent were anti-Jewish incidents (a more than 14% increase). Per this reporting, the Jewish community remains the top target of faith-based hate crimes for the 23rd consecutive year.
These assessments underscore the persistent threat of lethal violence and hate crimes against the Jewish community and other faith- and community-based institutions in the United States.
These groups have too frequently been the victim of many different types of violence. At this time of rising concern, FEMA has reported that on average only about one-third of nonprofits seeking critical security investments secure funding, annually./5 The requests exceed the available resources every year. Yet, in today's threat environment, demand for NSGP resources is expected to grow substantially more, further widening the needs gap.
Since its inception, the program has maintained bi-partisan, bicameral support as an efficient and effective means to accomplish a great deal of security enhancement and preparedness through modest grants./6 With this support and for the reasons stated above, we respectfully encourage you to bolster the NSGP funding, so our nation can do all that it can to protect at-risk faith- and community- based nonprofits from increasing extremist and hate-motivated threats.
Thank you for your consideration of this request.

Henrico County General District Court Judge Thomas Bondurant, Jr. convicted Harry Rogers, 37, of six misdemeanor counts, including four simple assault charges, one destruction of property charge, and one failure to stop at the scene of an accident charge. 
Bondurant handed down the maximum one-year sentence for each of the charges. After conducting a series of in-depth interviews with witnesses and victims, Henrico Commonwealth Attorney Shannon Taylor in July charged Rogers with seven additional felony charges[2] - four counts of assault with hate crimes, two counts of felonious attempted malicious wounding, and one count of felony hit and run. Rogers was found not guilty of the four hate-crime charges. His attorney argued that the enhancement was not applicable to Rogers's conduct in this case because the victims he hit were all white. Rogers still faces the three remaining felony charges, which Judge Bondurant certified to the Circuit Court grand jury. In a statement[3] to the New York Times, Taylor said she believed the hate-crime enhancements were necessary regardless of the victims' race. 'You were still being selected for race,' she said. 'You were still being considered inadequate, inferior because you were supporting the African-American community that the Klan 100 percent says in its own written materials — and part of their ideology that they believe — are lesser human beings.' As previously reported[4] by Law&#38;Crime, several witnesses to the incident reported that Rogers revved his engine before driving through the protesters occupying the roadway. Two of Rogers's three victims testified in court Monday.Mary Repolesaidthat she was on her way to warn other protesters when Rogers accelerated into the group, forcing her to jump on the hood of his truck because she 'didn't want to be run over,' ABC affiliate WRIC reported[5]. Henrico Police officer Igor Tsvetkov testified that following the incident, Rogers told him that he was the 'president of the Virginia sector of the KKK,' and that as many as 20 people in his KKK chapter had been in attendance at the protest but did not act because Rogers 'told them to stand down.' The hearing for Rogers's remaining three felony counts is currently scheduled for Sept. 14.

A white Michigan man was charged with a federal hate crime on Tuesday in an attack on a Black teenager during which he repeatedly used racial slurs before striking him in the face with a bike lock, prosecutors said.
The man, Lee James Mouat, 42, of Newport, also said that the Black teenager and his friends were “playing gang music” and “don’t belong on this beach,” in the confrontation at Sterling State Park, about 38 miles south of Detroit, according to a criminal complaint filed Tuesday in the Eastern District of Michigan.
The encounter, on June 6, came less than two weeks after the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis, which touched off protests around the country against police brutality and systemic racism.
Mr. Mouat was arrested shortly after the attack, which left the victim, Devin Freelon, 18, with a “facial fracture, facial lacerations and the loss of several teeth,” according to the complaint.
Mr. Mouat is already facing state felony charges of assault and ethnic intimidation. The new federal charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.
A lawyer for Mr. Mouat did not respond to a telephone message Tuesday evening.
One witness said Mr. Mouat referred to the victim and his friends with a racial slur and also called them “monsters,” according to the complaint. “I want to hit them with this cooler” and “I wish someone would say something to me so I can beat them,” he said, according to this witness.
Another witness told investigators that Mr. Mouat yelled “Black lives don’t matter” at the victim and his friends before the attack.
A friend of the victim told investigators that Mr. Mouat yelled at them twice, saying, “This is my beach.” Both times he referred to them as a racial slur, this friend said. He also said Mr. Mouat told the group that “I’ve got something for you in my car,” before he attacked the victim with the bike lock.
Mr. Freelon said he was retrieving a portable speaker from a vehicle in the beach’s parking lot when he was confronted by Mr. Mouat.
A GoFundMe page for Mr. Freelon raised more than $18,000 before a dentist’s office offered to provide free care.

When the victim began urinating, a man poked his head out a window and yelled at him to stop, police said. He and another man then came running out of the building, one with a sword, the other with brass knuckles.

A public artwork on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue has been damaged just days after the commission by the City of New York was completed.
Mayor Bill De Blasio joined the community effort to paint the 'Black Lives Matter' road mural in bold yellow letters last Thursday but by noon Monday a man had vandalized the area outside the President Trump's NYC residence, Trump Tower.
The project carried out by young people wearing 'I Am Peace' T-shirts last week, only last days before it was splattered in red paint.
Cops said the vandal was wearing a black shirt and black cap. The suspect dumped the paint then fled down 56th Street but it was smeared further - most of it across the letters 'K', 'L' and 'V' - by passing vehicles.
The suspect reportedly escaped before law enforcement officers could catch up with him.
Police said they are reviewing surveillance footage and asked people to get in contact with any information. Crews were working to get rid of the vandalism on Monday afternoon.
The iconic skyscraper has been heavily-guarded since Trump delved into the world of politics. It has been the site of numerous protests, including one on Saturday where Trump supporters clashed with anti-racism protesters.
On Monday a man wearing and selling 'Dump Trump' gear witnessed the property damage. 
He was pictured standing nearby a man holding up a sign seemingly intended to gaslight people highlighting racial inequalities. It read: 'The only time black lives matter is when they are shot by a white policeman or an Oreo cookie. Defend all policemen.'
An 'Oreo' is a derogatory term used against people of color, comparing them to the cookie which is classically brown on the outside and white on the inside. 
The slur suggests the person exhibits behavior that the person judging aligns with being characteristically white. 
The mural was one of five announced for New York City last month as part of an initiative to honor civil rights activists.
This month Trump expressed his opposition to the mural, saying it would denigrate the luxury shopping area. He also said it would 'further antagonize New York's finest'.
Before cops guarded the area while the mural was being painted, the president tweeted: 'Maybe our GREAT Police, who have been neutralized and scorned by a mayor who hates & disrespects them, won't let this symbol of hate be affixed to New York's greatest street.'
The decision came as Americans across the country expressed their hurt at statues and memorials to Confederate soldiers and slave-owners looming over public places for decades.
'When we say 'Black Lives Matter,' there is no more American statement, there is no more patriotic statement because there is no America without Black America,' de Blasio said. 
'We are acknowledging the truth of ourselves as Americans by saying 'Black Lives Matter.' We are righting a wrong.' 
Trump recently signed an executive order that would see anyone found to have tampered with a statue or monument face up to 10 years in prison.
It's unclear what the suspect's punishment could be. On Tuesday, the Contra Costa County District Attorney's Office charged David Nelson and Nicole Anderson with a hate crime after they destroyed a similar mural that was painted in Martinez, California on July 4.
'We must address the root and byproduct of systemic racism in our country. The Black Lives Matter movement is an important civil rights cause that deserves all of our attention,' District Attorney Diana Becton said in a statement.
'The mural completed last weekend was a peaceful and powerful way to communicate the importance of Black lives in Contra Costa County and the country. We must continue to elevate discussions and actually listen to one another in an effort to heal our community and country.'"

The conversation comes weeks after AJC released its 2020 Antisemitism in America Report, based on surveys of the general and Jewish populations across the United States, and the FBI annual Hate Crimes Statistics Report.
Ahead of the Hanukkah and Christmas holidays, Cardinal Dolan and Rabbi Marans will discuss the physical and spiritual health of faith communities, how the Catholic and Jewish communities are adjusting to the holiday season during the pandemic, and how religion can help in dealing with the coronavirus, especially now as the number of infected people is rising.
Thursday's conversation is part of the popular online American Jewish Committee (AJC) Advocacy Anywhere sessions, first launched in March. AJC Advocacy Anywhere has garnered nearly five million viewers across the United States and around the world.
Tomorrow's program will be the second featuring Cardinal Dolan and Rabbi Marans. In April, ahead of Easter and Passover, they engaged in a Catholic-Jewish Conversation on Faith and Interreligious Cooperation and discussed, among other issues, observing the holidays during the coronavirus pandemic."

^$^From California to Pennsylvania, governors and mayors across the U.S. are ratcheting up COVID-19 restrictions amid the record-shattering resurgence of the virus that is all but certain to get worse because of holiday travel and family gatherings over Thanksgiving.Leaders are closing businesses or curtailing hours and other operations, and they are ordering or imploring people to stay home and keep their distance from others to help stem a rising tide of infections that threatens to overwhelm the health care system.
""I must again pull back the reins,"" New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said Monday as he restricted indoor gatherings to 10 people, down from 25. ""It gives me no joy.""
California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced he is pulling the ""emergency brake"" on efforts to reopen the economy, saying the state is experiencing the fastest growth in cases yet, and if left unchecked, it will lead to ""catastrophic outcomes."" The move closes many nonessential indoor businesses and requires the wearing of masks outside homes, with limited exceptions.
Second vaccine shows promise in U.S. tests
A second experimental COVID-19 vaccine - this one from Moderna Inc. - yielded extraordinarily strong early results Monday, another badly needed dose of hope as the pandemic enters a terrible new phase.
Moderna said its vaccine appears to be 94.5% effective, according to preliminary data from an ongoing study. A week ago, competitor Pfizer Inc. announced its own vaccine looked 90% effective - news that puts both companies on track to seek permission within weeks for emergency use in the U.S.
The results are ""truly striking,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government's top infectious-diseases expert. ""The vaccines that we're talking about, and vaccines to come, are really the light at the end of the tunnel.""
A vaccine can't come fast enough, as virus cases topped
11 million in the U.S. over the weekend - 1 million of them recorded in just the past week. The outbreak has killed more than
1.3 million people worldwide, over 246,000 of them in the U.S.
Boy Scouts face nearly 90K abuse claims
NEW YORK - Close to 90,000 sexual abuse claims have been filed against the Boy Scouts of America as the Monday deadline arrived for submitting claims in the organization's bankruptcy case.
The number far exceeds the initial projections of lawyers across the United States who have been signing up clients since the Boy Scouts filed for bankruptcy protection in February in the face of hundreds of lawsuits alleging decades-old sex abuse by Scout leaders.
""We are devastated by the number of lives impacted by past abuse in Scouting and moved by the bravery of those who have come forward,"" the Boy Scouts said in a statement. ""We are heartbroken that we cannot undo their pain.""
A few hours before the Monday deadline, the number of claims totaled 88,500, lawyers said.
Eventually, the proceedings in federal bankruptcy court will lead to the creation of a compensation fund to pay out settlements to abuse survivors whose claims are upheld.
Hate crimes reach highest level in decade
WASHINGTON - Hate crimes in the U.S. rose to the highest level in more than a decade as federal officials also recorded the highest number of hate-motivated killings since the FBI began collecting that data in the early 1990s, according to an FBI report released Monday.
There were 51 hate crime murders in 2019, which includes 22 people who were killed in a shooting that targeted Mexicans at a Walmart in the border city of El Paso, Texas, the report said. The suspect in that August 2019 shooting, which left two dozen other people injured, was charged with both state and federal crimes in what authorities said was an attempt to scare Hispanics into leaving the United States.
There were 7,314 hate crimes last year, up from 7,120 the year before - and approaching the 7,783 of 2008. The FBI's annual report defines hate crimes as those motivated by bias based on a person's race, religion or sexual orientation, among other categories.
Some of the 2019 increases may be the result of better reporting by police departments, but law enforcement officials and advocacy groups don't doubt that hate crimes are on the rise. The Justice Department has for years been specifically prioritizing hate crime prosecutions.
The data also shows there was a nearly 7% increase in religion-based hate crimes, with 953 reports of crimes targeting Jews and Jewish institutions last year, up from 835 the year before. The FBI said the number of hate crimes against African Americans dropped slightly to 1,930, from 1,943.

Arbitrary budget cuts to the NYPD and performative acts like painting ""Black Lives Matter"" on the street won't get us there.
Instead, city leaders must implement a strategy that deploys all agencies alongside community partners within precincts and neighborhoods. Though we come from different backgrounds, our experiences demonstrate that this approach will lead to increased public safety, a reduction in justice-system entanglement, and fairer policing practices that help bolster police morale and improve police-community relations.
As the founder of NYC Together, Dana has spent over a decade placing youth at the center of the public safety conversation. In partnership with the NYPD, the nonprofit works to lessen the need for traditional law enforcement interventions. She has seen firsthand how we ask too much of our police in communities like Brownsville and East New York. Officers are often required to play the roles of social workers, teachers, mental health providers, bouncers, addiction specialists, after-school program directors and domestic violence caseworkers.
As a Marine deployed overseas, Zach found himself and other infantry and special operations forces ill-suited for diplomacy, international development, humanitarian work and other roles more akin to a city mayor than a soldier. On the ground, they had to adapt to negotiate truces, put people to work, and make communities safer. Lives were lost and opportunities were wasted because of failures to deploy civilian experts and diplomats alongside our troops.
We must not repeat this failure at home. Instead, we should build a 21st-century public safety ecosystem that distributes the sole responsibility of public safety from law enforcement across multiple city agencies.
New York has a remarkable number of municipal employees focused on everything from homelessness to mental health to housing, employment, youth, domestic violence and hate crimes, but they do not work together at the local level. These century-old silos need to be broken apart; agencies must be forced to share resources, cut duplicative services, and be combined into multi-agency task forces focused locally on improving outcomes in city neighborhoods.
Evidence such an approach could work already exists. In 2014, New York City established the city's Crisis Management System, which brought together 50 community-based partners in the city's 17 most violent precincts. to reduce shootings, interrupt and detect potentially violent conflicts through credible messengers, provide resources to young people at risk and mobilize community groups against gun violence.
All of these communities saw a sizable decrease in crime. One CMS site in South Jamaica had zero shootings in their focus area for 562 days. With the right multi-agency support, that model can expand citywide.
Here's another example. In Brownsville, hundreds of kids often gather on the streets late summer nights. In the past, noise complaints would lead to inevitable clashes between police and youth that would be played out in viral videos.
Last year, NYC Together worked with the local precinct to have community partners engage with the groups and offer services and support. Amidst the recent pandemic, this included the distribution of masks and hand sanitizer.
Imagine if the full weight of the Department of Youth and Community Development could be dispatched alongside other agencies like the Department of Education and community partners during those late-night hours to institute programming and opportunities for youth when needed.
Our city is now on a dangerous path. Civilians and police officers alike are battling gun violence and COVID-19 while experiencing exhaustion and anxiety without direction. No one is benefiting from the status quo. With bold leadership that implores city agencies to work together in neighborhoods 24/7, New York can develop a public-safety ecosystem that is a model for the rest of the country to follow.
