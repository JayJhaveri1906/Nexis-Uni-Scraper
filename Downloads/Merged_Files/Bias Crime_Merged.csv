The incident occurred at 7 a.m. Saturday, during the weekly Jewish Shabbos that began at sunset Friday, The New York Post[1]reported.According to Judaism, pigs are quintessentially unkosher animals and have long been viewed as an anti-Semitic symbol.Lakewood Police Lt. Leroy Marshall told the outlet that the probe is on into the bias crime but no arrests have been made as of midday Monday. 
Lakewood Scoop[2], which first reported the incident, said no notes were attached and no injuries were reported during the incidenteither.According to the New York Post, Marshall declined to identify the rabbi, citing an ongoing investigation. Lakewood Police Chief Greg Meyer told Lakewood Scoop that detectives from the agency were being assisted by the Ocean County Sheriff's Office crime scene investigations unit.The Anti-Defamation League officials denounced the act in a statement late Saturday. ""The alleged incident that took place in Lakewood on Saturday is absolutely horrifying,' said Scott Richman, regional director for the ADL's New York/New Jersey office.'No individual or group deserves to be targeted in this way. ADL has been deeply concerned by the rising tide of antisemitism in Ocean County, and this matter is no exception. We are thankful that Lakewood PD is continuing their investigation,' he added. According to Judaism, pigs are quintessentially unkosher animals Photo: AFP / NIKOLAY DOYCHINOV In a tweet posted soon after the incident, the ADL officials also requested people to share any information with Law Enforcement so that those responsible can be apprehended.""This incident is beyond horrifying &#38; should be condemned by all. We're glad @Lakewood_PD is investigating as an 'apparent bias crime'. Please share any information with Law Enforcement so that those responsible can be apprehended,"" ADL tweeted.Lakewood is home to a large ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, and its Beth Medrash Govoha is the biggest in the United States. It has also been on the radar of the Anti-Defamation League in recent months.Jews in the U.S. suffered the largest number of anti-Semitic[3] incidents in 2019 since the Anti-Defamation League began collecting records 40 years ago, the racism watchdog said in a report that it releasedin May. Reuters,[4] which quoted the report, stated that 2107 anti-Semitic incidents recorded in 2019 in the U.S. included deadly attacks by gunmen at a California Synagogue and a New Jersey kosher grocery store, and a fatal stabbing at a rabbi's home in New York.

 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE / April 2002 McPhail / GENDER-BIAS HATE CRIMES GENDER-BIAS HATE CRIMES A Review BEVERLY A. MCPHAIL University ofTexas at Austin Currently, hate crimes and hate crime policy are receiving increased public and scholarly attention. Much of the attention has been focused on crimes committed out of bias toward a victim's membership in a group based on race, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity/national origin. However, more recently, gender has been included as a status category, often causing heated debate. This article looks at the history of the initial exclusion, then inclusion, of gender in the hate crime domain. The reasons for the uneasy fit of gender as a status category are recounted, as well as arguments both for and against inclusion of gender within the hate crime model. The problem of gender essentialism is examined, which results in the marginalization of the multiple category statuses of many women. The article con- cludes with implications for research, policy, and practice. Key words: violence against women, hate crimes, bias crimes, gender-bias hate crimes, sexual assault, domes- tic violence AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN is dragged to his death behind a pickup truck in Jasper, Texas. A young gay college student is beaten and left to die draped on a fence in Laramie, Wyoming. Four schoolgirls and their female teacher are shot to death by two male classmates at Westside Middle School in Jonesboro, Arkan- sas. Each of these horrific murders left the coun- try first reeling and then debating the causes and solutions to such violence. However, the three crimes were discussed in very different ways. The first two crimes are widely regarded as hate crimes and led to a national discussion on racismand homophobia, respectively. However, Jenness and Grattet (2001) noted the latter crime was treated very differently from the others. In contrast to these two incidents, the murder of four young girls in a Jonesboro, Arkansas schoolyard in March of 1998 generally has not been viewed as a hate crime, despite the revelation that the young boys in custody for the killings sought to shoot girls because it was girls that angered them. That is, they selected their victims on the basis of gender. Time Magazine (Labi, 1998) referred to it as a ""youth crime"" and Newsweek (McCormick, 1998) called it a ""schoolyard crime."" Because of this framing, the in- cident triggered a different set of legal and policy discussions, most often in terms of school violence and the debate over gun control.

TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE, Vol. 3, No. 2, April 2002 125-143 2002 Sage Publications The discrepancies between how these crimes were viewed, reported, and discussed illus- trates the present debate over including gender- bias-motivated violence under the rubric of hate crime definitions and pol- icy. The story of the inter- section between gender and hate crime policy has been tumultuous and controversial. The debate continues today. This article will exam- ine the intersection of gender and hate crime policy. Before discussing the specifics of gender, hate crime policy in gen- eral will be reviewed followed by a history of gender in hate crime policy. The current debate over whether gender fits within the hate crime paradigmwill be recounted with both sides of the controversy presented. The problemof gen- der essentialismwithin hate crime policy will be presented, which means examining the multi- ple status categories of women; for instance, how do we talk about hate crimes against women of color and lesbian women? The article will conclude with implications for policy, prac- tice, and research. HATE CRIME OVERVIEW It is beyond the scope of this article to provide a complete review of hate crime policy, which is incredibly complex and nuanced. However, it is helpful to have a basic understanding of the hate crime policy arena before looking at how gender fits within this domain. Although the term hate crime is new, the violence it describes is not. In cataloguing intergroup violence and conflict in the 20th century in his book Mass Hate , Kressel (1996) wrote, ""Blood has gushed so freely, and with such frequency, that one might consider the urge to kill one's neighbor an inborn characteristic of our species"" (p. 1). Al- though violence based on prejudice and bias is not new, the social movements that brought themto the forefront are more recently orga- nized. Hate crime policy emerged from a multi- tude of social movements including the civil rights movement, the women's rights move- ment, the gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgendered (GLBT) movement, and most recently, the crime victims' movement. Actually, the term hate crime is somewhat of a misnomer. It is difficult to operationalize hate, a 126 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE / April 2002 KEY POINTS OF THE RESEARCH REVIEW The category of gender was actively excluded fromhate crime policy during the early years of the policy process when social movements and advocacy organizations set the policy agenda. Gender as a status category was later added as the policy-making process matured and a policy tem- plate for hate crimes was institutionalized. Be- cause gender was already a standard subject of federal discrimination law, the status was folded in by policy makers rather than being actively pro- moted by women's groups. Hate crime policy in general remains controver- sial, although the status categories of religion, race, and ethnicity are largely established. The cat- egories of sexual orientation, gender, and disabil- ity have been more recently proposed and frequently debated. In some ways, gender as a status category fits the hate crime paradigm in that women are often dis- criminately selected as victims due solely to their gender, the assault is often unprovoked, no other motives (such as robbery) are involved, gender- based epithets are frequently used, there are long- termemotional and physical consequences, and women as a group are affected. In some ways, gender as a status category is deter- mined to not to fit the hate crime paradigm, most often due to the fact that women often know their attackers and that violence against women is so prevalent. Gender as a status category is often viewed in an essentialist way, ignoring the multiple statuses of the victimsuch as women of color and lesbian women. The effects of adding gender to hate crime policy are debatable. For some, such an addition is merely symbolic with little enforcement or over- sight. Alternatively, others believe if monitored and enforced, gender as a status category could provide new protections and increased options for women. Gender is increasingly part of the hate crime pol- icy template, which calls for a plan of action with regard to practice, policy, and research. The story of the intersection between gender and hate crime policy has been tumultuous and controversial. subjective human emotion, much as it is diffi- cult to characterize love. Instead, Lawrence (1999) described hate crimes as ""bias crimes""; that is, crimes committed as an act of prejudice: ""I use the term'bias crime' rather than 'hate crime' to emphasize that the key factor in a bias crime is not the perpetrator's hatred of the vic- timper se, but rather his bias or prejudice to- ward that victim"" (p. 9). Weisburd and Levin (1994) defined hate crimes as ""the offender's discriminatory use of violence to enforce a par- ticular social hierarchy that is biased against the targeted status hierarchy"" (p. 36). Hate crimes can be the result of hatred but also stemfroma perpetrator's stereotypical views of their victim and the community they represent, resentment, a desire to punish that victim and their commu- nity for alleged transgressions, feelings of power and control, a need to keep victims and their communities in their place, a need for a thrill or adventure, the need to affirmmasculin- ity and male bonds, and from multiple motives, and from motives the perpetrator may not even be aware of himself (Franklin, 1998; Levin & McDevitt, 1993). Bias crimes generally consist of two parts; that is, the basic crime (for instance, an assault or vandalism) and the motivation that inspired it. Lawrence (1999) described two models of bias crime--the ""discriminatory selection model"" and the ""animus model."" The former is based on a perpetrator's discriminatory selection of a vic- tim. In this model, ""it is irrelevant why an of- fender selected his victimon the basis of race or group; it is sufficient that the offender did so"" (p. 30). The animus model rests on the of- fender's hatred of the victim's actual or per- ceived group membership. Particular statutes criminalize one or the other or a combination of these two motivations. Which status groups are selected for coverage by hate crimes is a continuing debate and a fo- cus of this article. Jenness and Broad (1997) de- scribed such statutes: The protected statuses contained in hate crime legis- lation, in effect, articulate who does and does not qualify as a victim. In so doing, they also determine who is and is not entitled to legal recourse . . . there is a definite ranking of status provisions in hate crime law. (p. 42) Race, ethnicity, and religion are the most widely accepted, with disability being added later, and sexual orientation and gender categories being the most controversial and therefore included in some statutes and not in others. The anti-hate-crime movement has sought le- gal remedies for the problem of hate crime. Civil remedies and enhanced penalties were often adopted based on the supposition that hate crimes are not merely acts of violence against an individual but cause great harmto the victim's community specifically, as well as to the social fabric of our society more generally. Largely in response to social movement activism and pub- lic attention to several widely publicized hate crimes, by 1995, the federal government, 37 states, and the District of Columbia had passed hate crime laws (Jacobs & Potter, 1998). The passage of such laws has not been with- out controversy. Opponents of hate crime law cite a variety of objections including Constitu- tional challenges to the First and Fourteenth Amendments (free speech and equal protection, respectively); fears that such policies promote divisiveness and identity politics at the expense of unity; and problems with establishing moti- vation (Jacobs & Potter, 1998). However, propo- nents of hate crime policy believe, ""Because ra- cial harmony and equality are among the highest values held in our society, crimes that violate these values should be punished and must be punished, specifically as bias crimes"" (Lawrence, 1999, p. 167). Often proponents seek to ""send a message"" with hate crime laws that prejudice expressed in violent assaults or prop- erty damage will not be tolerated. POLICY HISTORY OF GENDER AND HATE CRIME As previously mentioned, social movement organizations have provided the primary impe- tus to much hate crime policy. These organiza- tions were outraged by the violence perpetrated against their members. Keeping informal statis- tics was often a way to begin to address the problem. However, as advocacy groups began to gather momentum and political clout, the or- ganizations frequently turned to the govern- ment for action and remedies. McPhail / GENDER-BIAS HATE CRIMES 127 To begin to address the problemof hate crime, the prevalence of the problem was im- portant to establish. The Coalition on Hate Crimes Prevention was formed to sponsor the Hate Crimes Statistics Act (HCSA) at the federal level, which would require the U.S. Attorney General to gather and publish hate crime statis- tics on selected groups. The coalition was com- posed of civil rights, religious, peace, gay and lesbian, and ethnic groups (Jenness & Broad, 1997). Women's groups were noticeably absent. The first Congressional hearings on hate crime oc- curred in 1985 and cen- tered on the following three designated core cat- egories: race, religion, and ethnicity. However, between the introduction of the HCSA in 1985 and its passage in 1990, a pro- cess termed domain expan- sion occurred. Jenness and Grattet (2001) defined do- main expansion as ""when claimsmakers offer new definitions for and thus extend the bound- aries of the phenomenon under discussion"" (p. 54). In 1986, congressional hearings were held on antigay violence due to the influence and participation of GLBT agencies and organiza- tions, which resulted in the phrase ""homosexu- ality or heterosexuality"" being added to the bill before its passage in 1990. Despite the process of domain expansion, gender was not added at this time. At a HCSA hearing in 1988, Molly Yard, then-president of the National Organization for Women (NOW), submitted written testimony to be included in the record (Yard, 1988). Yard sought to amend the HCSA by adding gender as a protected cate- gory. She drew on feminist theory and research to demonstrate that the majority of violence committed against women occurs at the hands of men, often the result of misogyny. Yard de- scribed rape and heterosexual domestic vio- lence as tools of political oppression meant to keep women subordinate. She also included vi- olence against abortion providers and clinics as falling under the domain of hate crime. She noted two states already had included gender in their hate crime laws, both California and Min- nesota. Yard described the many parallels be- tween hate crimes and violence against women. She noted the irony that other social movement groups often used rape as an analogy for the harms that hate crimes do and yet refused to add protections for women, who are primarily the victims of rape. Yard stated, Just as ethnic, religious, homophobic, and racist vio- lence is motivated by hate, so also are rape, wife abuse, and anti-abortion terrorismand a host of other crimes directed at women. Until we accept this concept as a nation and act on the obvious, we can- not truly understand the scope and misogyny in American society and begin to eradicate the problem and eliminate the tragic and shameful results. (p. 17) Despite her testimony, gender as a category was not adopted. An editorial in a women's advocacy newslet- ter documents the deliberate exclusion of both the status category of gender fromthe HCSA and women's organizations from the policy- making process. In the winter of 1989, the National Organization for Women and the National Coalition Against Domes- tic Violence sought to rectify the exclusion of women fromthe bill through a series of meetings with the Coalition on Hate Crimes. Aside from the absence of any women's groups, the Coalition on Hate Crimes is an otherwise broad coalition of civil rights, reli- gious, peace, gay, and ethnic rights groups. In re- sponse to the women's arguments for inclusion, the member organizations of the Coalition on Hate Crimes were polled. They agreed unanimously that they would not support a Hate Crimes Bill that in- cluded gender. The Hate Crimes Coalition then can- celled all future meetings with the women's rights groups. (de Santis, 1990, p. 1) The reasons offered for the exclusion of women were both strategic and ideological. For in- stance, coalition members feared that adding gender would delay passage of the bill and sug- gested that gender be considered for inclusion at a later date (Copeland & Wolfe, 1991). Other rationales for excluding gender included fears that inclusion would open the door for other groups such as age and disability; would make the statistics-gathering requirement too cum- bersome due to the prevalence of violence 128 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE / April 2002 The first Congressional hearings on hate crime occurred in 1985 and centered on the following three designated core categories: race, religion, and ethnicity. against women; and that women do not fit the hate crimes paradigm because many of them know their attackers (Copeland & Wolfe, 1991). Apparently, an internal memorandum pre- pared by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) was influential in laying out the arguments both for including and excluding gender as a cate- gory (Freeman, 1990); however, the ADL does not make this document public today. Angelari (1994) commented on the Coalition's stance. Ironically the Coalition argued that ""without the in- clusion of sexual orientation in the act, there would be two standards. Crimes against gays and lesbians would be viewed as less significant, less pervasive, and less reprehensible than crimes motivated by ra- cial, religious, or ethnic prejudice."" That a coalition of religious, civil rights, and gay and lesbian organi- zations should fail to see that their actions relegated crimes against women to the same secondary posi- tion illustrates one of the major obstacles that women's advocates must overcome before violence against women will be treated as a hate crime. (p. 85) Therefore, gender was not included as a cate- gory for protection in the HCSA that passed in 1990, and statistics on gender-bias-motivated crime are not reported at the federal level with other hate crimes. Disability, both mental and physical, was added as a category in 1994 under a provision of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act (FBI, 1999a). Gender was often omitted at the state level as well. The ADL formulated a model statute in 1981 that was adopted by many states. How- ever, the statute did not include gender as a sta- tus category. This occurred in spite of the fact that the first hate crime law passed in the United States was in California in 1978, which included gender as a category. Perhaps due to its exclusion fromthe HCSA, 2 years later, Congress sought to address vio- lence against women in a separate bill, the Vio- lence Against Women Act (VAWA), which sub- sequently passed in 1994. The bill had multiple provisions including funding for victimser- vices, education, and training for members of the criminal justice system. The law also con- tained a historic civil rights provision, Title III, which declared for the first time that ""violent crimes motivated by the victim's gender are dis- criminatory and violate the victim's federal civil rights"" (Goldscheid & Kraham, 1995, p. 505). Al- though not specifically termed hate crime, this was the effect of Title III. Unfortunately, the U.S. Supreme Court declared this section of the VAWA unconstitutional in 2000. United States v. Morrison et al. held, by a 5-4 ruling, that Con- gress did not have the authority to legislate the civil rights provision under the basis of the ei- ther the Commerce Clause or the Fourteenth Amendment, which Congress had cited as sources of federal authority (United States v. Morrison et al. , 1999). In 1994, Congress passed a sentence enhance- ment law, the Hate Crimes Sentencing Enhance- ment Act of 1994 (HCSEA), which called for en- hancing sentences by no less than three offense levels for hate crimes. For the first time in fed- eral policy, the list of protected statuses in- cluded gender. Currently before Congress is the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act (for- merly termed the Hate Crimes Prevention Act) that seeks to expand hate crime coverage for three categories, gender, sexual orientation, and disability, as well as expanding the application of hate crime law to a greater sphere than cur- rently permitted. In a Senate hearing on this bill, gender as a status category was debated with several groups specifically addressing the in- clusion of gender including the Center for Women's Policy Studies, the NOW Legal De- fense and Education Fund, and GenderPAC (Combating Hate Crimes, 1999). Jenness and Grattet (2001) described the early policy process in which social movement orga- nizations were critical in defining the problem of hate crimes, specifying target status catego- ries to be included, and advocating for legal so- lutions. Women's organizations were not active in the process, sometimes even being deliber- ately shut out, as previously described. How- ever, a second wave of hate crimes policy mak- ing commenced that allowed gender to be added as a category in the VAWA, HCSEA, HCPA and more than 20 states (for a listing of states, see Lawrence, 1999, pp. 178-189). This top-down addition of gender can be attributed to the fact that gender was already a standard subject of state and federal discrimination law and, thus, became folded into hate crime policy by lawmakers rather than grassroots activists. McPhail / GENDER-BIAS HATE CRIMES 129 As part of this move to increasingly include gen- der as a status category, in 1996, the ADL added gender to its model hate crime statute (ADL, 1999). In the current hate crime policy arena, gender is often likely to be on the list of pro- tected statuses in proposed legislation. Earl and Soule (2001) found that states that had previously passed hate crime law were less likely to go back and add gender as a category. Looking at various factors that affected whether a state included gender in their hate crime law, Earl and Soule found high issue salience, high per capita income, and a low non-White population were predictors of the in- clusion of the status cate- gory of gender in the state statute. Also, states in the Pacific Northwest were more likely to include gender than southern states. When Steven M. Free- man, director of the ADL Legal Affairs Department and author of the 1990 ADL internal memoran- dum, was asked why his organization first excluded and then included gender as a category, he (Steven M. Freeman, personal communication, March 24, 2000) re- sponded, It would not be accurate to say that gender was first excluded, and then we had a change of heart. It would be more accurate to say that after we had some experience with the statute, the question was raised internally as to whether it should be broader than originally drafted. When we brought to our lay leadership the question of whether to include gen- der, the vote was affirmative. Freeman (Steven M. Freeman, personal com- munication, March 24, 2000) also offered the fol- lowing caveat: I would also point out that including ""gender"" as a category is different than including ""women,"" even though it is obvious that in most gender-based hate crimes, the victims are women. We regard it as le- gally and politically significant that people of differ- ent races, religions, national origins, sexual orienta- tions, and genders are covered by our language-- not merely minorities. Freeman's point is well taken. Although not widely acknowledged in the media, hate crime law protects people of any race, ethnicity/na- tional origin, all sexual orientations, religions, and both genders, no matter whether they are in the majority or minority. Therefore, men are protected when they are targeted due to their gender, as are women. In a newspaper search, only two instances were found in which crimes were successfully prosecuted on the basis of gender bias (Jordan, 1994; Perry, 2000). According to J. McDevitt (personal communication, October 4, 2001), the bar is being raised for prosecuting gender bias motivated crimes. For instance, in Massachu- setts, the criteria for prosecution require that ep- ithets uttered during the commission of the crime denigrate women as a class and that at least two restraining orders have been filed on a perpetrator by two different persons for hate crime charges to be filed in a domestic violence case. The history of the gender status category within the hate crime model is one of first exclu- sion and then gradual inclusion as hate crime policy became institutionalized. However, the inclusion of the category remains more sym- bolic than realized as it is rarely invoked and re- mains controversial. Less than one half of the states include gender in their hate crime laws. For many, the gender category remains an un- easy fit in the hate crime model. FITTING GENDER INTO THE HATE CRIME PARADIGM Although gender is frequently becoming a part of the hate crime policy template, its fit within the hate crime paradigm remains contro- versial. Weisburd and Levin (1994) noted, ""The theoretical fit between gender-motivated crimes of violence and traditional bias crimes is concedingly not an exact fit, but we believe it is a substantial one"" (p. 42). Following are reasons it is not an exact fit and arguments for both its ex- clusion and inclusion. 130 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE / April 2002 The history of the gender status category within the hate crime model is one of first exclusion and then gradual inclusion as hate crime policy became institutionalized. However, the inclusion of the category remains more symbolic than realized as it is rarely invoked and remains controversial. Reasons for an Uneasy Fit One reason gender fits less easily within a hate crime paradigm is the simple fact that it came later in time in the hate crime policy- making process. As mentioned earlier, the triad of race, ethnicity, and religion are considered ""core"" or ""classic"" status categories. The U.S. Attorney General charged the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with collecting hate crime statistics in accordance with the HCSA's man- date. To collect the data, the FBI had to develop guidelines to establish which criminal acts con- stitute bias crimes (FBI, 1999b). The agency built the guidelines around the statuses covered in the HCSA at that time; that is, race, religion, sex- ual orientation, and ethnicity/national origin. The guidelines direct investigators to assess specific factors in attributing bias. A few of the guidelines are (a) certain objects, items, or things that indicate bias were used (e.g., the of- fenders wore white sheets with hoods covering their faces or a burning cross was left in front of the victim's residence); (b) the victim was en- gaged in activities promoting his/her race, reli- gion, disability, sexual orientation, or ethnicity/ national origin (e.g., the victim was a member of the NAACP or participated in gay rights dem- onstrations); and (c) the incident coincided with a holiday or date of particular significance relat- ing to race, religion, disability, sexual orienta- tion, or ethnicity/national origin (e.g., Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Rosh Hashanah, and so forth) (FBI, 1999b). Although the guidelines give concrete exam- ples that refer to race, religion, and sexual orien- tation, none of the examples presented for clari- fication refer to gender. Subsequent federal training manuals also did not mention gender (see for example, McLaughlin, Brilliant, & Lang, 1995). As a result, the racial animus model be- came the prototypical hate crime and the racial animus offender became the prototypical of- fender (Wang, 1997). The ""typical"" hate crime is often used as a measure by police officers who often compare the crime to a typical hate crime to see if it meets certain criteria; that is, no prov- ocation by the victim, a specific target, no prior encounter between victims and perpetrator, and accompanying derogatory remarks (Boyd, Berk, & Hamner, 1996). Therefore, one reason gender fits less well, at times, into the hate crime paradigmis merely because the policy was tai- lored around the inclusion of the other spe- cific status categories and the exclusion of gender. The status category of gender comes in as a second-tier hate crime, which may allow it to be treated differently, and perhaps not as seri- ously as the top tier hate crimes of race, religion, and ethnicity/national origin. It is also interesting to note that the FBI deter- mined that it was not necessary to create new crime categories but instead collect additional information, primarily on bias motivation, on crimes currently reported to the Uniform Crime Report (UCR) program(FBI, 1997). Ironically, 1 of the 11 traditional offenses named included ""forcible rape."" Because under the HCSA the category of gender was not recognized as a sta- tus category, the rape of a woman is not a hate crime unless the victim is sexually assaulted be- cause of the perpetrator's bias due to her race, religion, ethnicity/national origin, sexual ori- entation, disability, or religion. Other reasons why gender-bias crimes are of- ten not viewed as hate crimes are more struc- tural and represent institutionalismsexism. As Choundas (1995) explained, ""Habitual precon- ceptions, unexamined assumptions, and un- considered judgments--as invidious and damaging as more deliberate prejudices when finally implemented into discriminatory disad- vantaging--are the evasive phenomena most reliably suspected as yielding the exclusion of gender-crime victims from enhanced protec- tion"" (p. 1162). For instance, society's continued belief in rape myths and separation of the public and private spheres continue to cause violence against women to be seen in a different, and of- ten less serious, light. A painful example is dem- onstrated by the words of Senator Orin Hatch (R-Utah) during a Congressional hearing on the VAWA (cited in Gaffney, 1997): Say you have a man who believes a woman is attrac- tive. He feels encouraged by her and he's so moti- vated by that encouragement that he rips her clothes off and has sex with her against her will. Now let's say you have another man who grabs a woman off some lonely road and in the process of raping her says words like, ""You're wearing a skirt! You're a McPhail / GENDER-BIAS HATE CRIMES 131 woman! I hate women! I'm going to show you, you woman!"" Now the first one's terrible. But the other's much worse. If a man rapes a woman while telling her he loves her, that's a far cry fromsaying he hates her. A lust factor does not spring fromanimus. (p. 259) In this case, clearly rape myth acceptance and ignorance by policy makers play a role in not understanding gender-based violence. The so- cialization of sex roles, gender stereotypes and expectations, the historic legacy of minimizing violence against women, and the male justifica- tion of rape all play a part in not recognizing vi- olence against women as a hate crime. Choundas (1995) offered two additional rea- sons that cause people to miss seeing violence against women in the same light as racial or reli- gious prejudice: its preva- lence and the fact that women constitute half the population. These two factors make violence against women look like ""essentially randomand unrelated manifesta- tions"" (p. 1082). When women make up more than half the population, they do not fit the model of a powerless minority. Another reason for not seeing women as fit- ting a hate crimes model is the acceptance of lib- eral rather than radical feminist perspective to explain violence against women. Largely due to the work of liberal feminists, violence against women has received increased attention, fund- ing, and legal reform. However, the liberal femi- nist perspective focuses on gaining equality with men in the public sphere, often without ex- plicating the root causes of the inequalities. However, a radical feminist perspective ac- knowledges the existence of a patriarchy in which violence is used as a tool of male oppres- sion. For instance, Brownmiller (1975) wrote, Fromprehistoric times to the present, I believe rape has played a critical function. It is nothing more or less than a conscious process of intimidation by which all men keep all women in a state of fear. (pp. 14- 15) The radical feminist perspective is not widely accepted by policy makers and hate crime ac- tors, leading to the conceptualization of vio- lence against women as personal and individual, not political. A radical feminist per- spective more firmly situates the category of gender within the hate crime paradigm, whereas a liberal feminist perspective primarily seeks legal safeguards without addressing the underlying causes or motivations of violence against women. Arguments Against Gender Fitting in a Hate Crime Paradigm There are many arguments made why gender should not be included as a category in hate crime policy. Opponents of gender inclusion of- ten fail to see gender fitting the standard bias crime model; that is, ""the victim is attacked be- cause he [sic] possesses the group characteris- tic"" (Lawrence, 1999, p. 14). Hate crime logic often posits that victims are interchangeable and that victims have little or no preexisting re- lationship with the perpetrator. The fact that many female victims know their attackers pre- cludes some advocates and policy makers from fitting rape and domestic violence into a hate crime model. However, Lawrence (1999) pro- vided a helpful rebuttal of this assertion. The existence of a prior relationship between victim and perpetrator, moreover, is not incompatible with the existence of a bias crime. The lack of prior rela- tionship may be a description of most bias crimes, but it is not a sine qua non for all bias crimes. (p. 16) Unfortunately, many hate crimes are perpe- trated on neighbors and coworkers. Making a prior relationship a disqualification of hate crime status would exempt these crimes as well. There is a long history of a prior relationship between an offender and victimcausing vio- lence against women to be viewed in a different, less serious, light. For instance, traditionally, most state sexual assault laws included a ""mari- tal rape exemption"" clause that specifically ex- cluded the husband fromprosecution for raping his wife. The use of a prior relationship to ex- clude hate crime determination is just the latest 132 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE / April 2002 The fact that many female victims know their attackers precludes some advocates and policy makers from fitting rape and domestic violence into a hate crime model. in a long line of justifications for using a woman's acquaintance with her attacker to min- imize and rationalize violence. In response, Pendo (1994) stated, ""In fact, the previous rela- tionship makes the crime more heinous because the sense of connection and shared community implied in social familiarity is viciously shat- tered"" (p. 168). How far this standard can be pushed was demonstrated in a successful prosecution of gender-motivated violence under the California hate crime law. In this case, the perpetrator was accused of attacking five women. In four of the attacks, the man, who was unknown to all of the women, approached them with a question or a comment. The women generally responded with a few words before moving away, and then were physically assaulted by the perpetrator. In the fifth attack, the man knocked a female victim to the ground without either of themsaying a word, causing her to suffer a fractured skull. Al- though there was a pattern of discriminatory se- lection of women for attack, the jury made a dis- tinction between the five cases. The assault in which the woman spoke not a word to him was deemed a hate crime, and the other four assaults were termed ""misdemeanor battery."" Because the other four women had exchanged a few words with the assailant, they were determined to have ""spurned his advances"" and therefore the perpetrator's motivation was deemed their rejection of himrather than his bias toward women (Perry, 2000). Prosecutor Deputy Dis- trict Attorney Hector Jimenez, head of the hate crime prosecution unit, reported that the mixed verdict revealed the difficulty of using the hate crime statute in attacks on women (Perry, 2000). Lesbian battering is also an uneasy fit into the hate crime paradigm. Not only does it have the same intimacy element problems that hetero- sexual violence does, in addition the perpetra- tors are of the same gender and the same sexual orientation. This would generally preclude it from being termed a hate crime because the FBI guidelines state that the perpetrator and victims must be from different status categories (FBI, 1999b). However, the primary distinction of a hate crime is that it was committed due to bias against the group. In a review of the literature, West (1998) found that battering within lesbian relationships is often caused by the same factors as within heterosexual violence, such as sub- stance abuse, a family history of violence, de- pendency/autonomy issues, and power imbal- ances. However, an untested but strongly suggested underlying dynamic is that of inter- nalized homophobia (West, 1998). That is, soci- etal discrimination and hatred of homosexuals is turned inward, and then outward, in acts of violence toward a lesbian partner. With this un- derstanding, lesbian battering could fit the hate crime paradigm; that is, the violence was a re- sult of bias against a group, despite the fact that the perpetrator belongs to the same group. Such an argument, however, would be a stretch of the hate crime paradigm and most likely deemed an uneasy fit, as is gender generally. Heretofore, hate crimes due to sexual orientation bias is largely recognized, researched, and discussed when heterosexuals target GBLT victims. Clearly, lesbian battering is an area that war- rants further exploration and discussion with regard to its fit in the hate crime framework. Another argument often cited in the dis- avowal of gender as a status category is the fact that there are already special laws that address violence against women, such as sexual assault and domestic violence laws. Although this is true, these laws do not always provide the re- dress and justice sought by survivors of vio- lence. For instance, the report The Response to Rape: Detours on the Road to Equal Justice, pre- pared by the majority staff of the Senate Judi- ciary Committee (1993), found that (a) more than half of all rape prosecutions result in either a dismissal or acquittal; (b) a rape prosecution is more than twice as likely as a murder prosecu- tion to be dismissed and 30% more likely to be dismissed than a robbery; (c) almost one quarter of convicted rapists are not sentenced to prison but instead are released on probation; and (d) 98% of rape victims will never see their at- tacker apprehended, convicted, and incarcer- ated. Although laws are in place, and certainly are an improvement over even a decade ago, clearly the laws as they stand do not adequately address issues of violence against women. Adding gender as a category in hate crime laws could give prosecutors and police officers new tools to secure convictions, give convicted of- McPhail / GENDER-BIAS HATE CRIMES 133 fenders enhanced penalties, and give the public a better understanding of the motivations of much of the violence committed against women. Declaration of the unconstitutionality of the VAWA Title III civil rights provision only adds to this argument. Another reason given for exclusion of gender as a category is less ideological and more logisti- cal. For instance, some opponents fear the addi- tion of gender into hate crime categories will overwhelmdata-collection efforts. Goldscheid (1999) responded to that argument, Perhaps the principal or underlying objection to treating domestic violence and sexual assaults as civil rights cases is the staggering number of those crimes committed each year. Yet it would be an ab- surd perversion of our justice systemif the preva- lence of a problembecame the justification for ignoring it. (p. 151) A related fear is that with violence against women being so prevalent, including gender as a status category would make the other status categories look less important and frequent in comparison. The final argument most often given for the exclusion of gender concerns the perpetrator's motivation. That is, some argue that men who attack and assault women do not necessarily hate them. Although this can be true, it is true for all other status categories as well. As previ- ously addressed, ""hate"" crime is less about hate than bias or prejudice. Weisburd and Levin (1994) noted, ""The key to bias crime categorization is not really about the hateful 'specific intent' of the offender, but rather the offender's discrimina- tory use of violence to en- force a particular social hierarchy that is biased against the targeted status category"" (p. 36). Jenness and Grattet (2001) re- ported that recent judicial decisions on hate crime cases have shifted the fo- cus fromthe offender's motivation to the offender's discriminatory se- lection of his victim. Women are both discriminatorily selected on the basis of their gender and also due to animus, in this case, misogyny, as well as other motiva- tions. In one report of the motives of rapists (Scully & Marolla, 1985), perpetrators admitted a variety of motivations, many of which fell into either the discriminatory selection model or the animus model, or both. Several of the stated rea- sons included motives of power, collective lia- bility, and sexual access to unwilling women, as well as recreation, adventure, or a fantasy come true. The authors noted, We found that rape was frequently a means of re- venge and punishment. Implicit in revenge-rapes was the notion that women were collectively liable for the rapists' problems. In some cases, victims were substitutes for significant women on whom the men desired revenge. In other cases, victims were thought to represent all women, and rape was used to punish, humiliate, and ""put them in their place."" In both cases, women were seen as a class, a category, not as individuals. (p. 261) Also, it is important to note that in other types of hate crimes, the motives are mixed as well and not always about hate. For instance, Frank- lin's (1998) interviews with men who had per- petrated assaults on gay men found ""multiple determinism"" rather than simple accounts of motivation such as hate or repressed homosexu- ality. Men used this crime for ""demonstrating their masculinity, garnering social approval, and alleviating boredom"" (p. 19). Franklin com- pared the similarities between men who are ""gay-bashers"" and men who rape women be- cause, in both groups, the offenders often act in a peer context in which the victimis an object, ""a dramatic prop, a vehicle for ritualized con- quest"" (p. 12). Our society in general seems reluctant to la- bel male violence against women due to ""hate."" Individual mental or moral defects in the man or provocation by the woman are much more readily accepted by laypersons. Pharr (1990) noted an irony in this, ""'Man-hater' is a com- mon expression but 'woman-hater' is not, de- spite the brutal evidence of woman-hating that 134 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE / April 2002 Our society in general seems reluctant to label male violence against women due to ""hate."" Individual mental or moral defects in the man or provocation by the woman are much more readily accepted by laypersons. surrounds us: murder, rape, battering, incest"" (p. 3). Arguments for Gender Fitting in a Hate Crime Paradigm Violence against women fits the hate crime paradigm when women are selected as victims due to their gender (discriminatory selection model) or due to the perpetrator's hatred of women (animus model). In either case, women are targeted because they are women. Many crimes committed against women fit these mod- els, such as rape, domestic violence, and mur- ders of women in which men are the primary perpetrators and women the primary victims. One criteria of a hate crime is that offender and perpetrator(s) are fromdifferent groups. Although same-sex violence occurs, violence against women is primarily committed by men. However, just like any other crime, the facts of the case must be weighed to make a judgment of whether it meets the criteria of hate crime. The formulation of violence against women as hate crime fits with radical feminist theories of violence that emerged with the women's movement. One of the major successes of the women's movement was transforming the conceptualiza- tion of violence against women from a personal problemof individual men to a political process meant to subordinate women. MacKinnon (1991) presented the radical feminist perspec- tive when she stated, ""Women are sexually as- saulted because they are women; not individually or at random, but on the basis of sex, because of their membership in a group de- fined by gender"" (p. 1301). Caputi and Russell (1992) term the murder of women femicide, that is, ""the most extreme form of sexist terrorism, motivated by hatred, contempt, pleasure, or a sense of ownership of women"" (p. 15). What may be ""new"" arguments for many actors within the hate crime policy domain are actually old arguments within the feminist movement. This hatred of women and the discriminatory selection of women for violence meets the broad ideological basis for hate crime. One horrific in- cident of violence against women is frequently held up as the hallmark of gender-biased hate crime. The crime occurred in Montreal, Canada, on December 6, 1989, at the University of Mon- treal. Caputi and Russell (1992) described the massacre. On that day, 25 year-old combat magazine aficio- nado Marc Lepin suited up for war and rushed the school of engineering. In one classroom, he sepa- rated the women from the men, ordered the men out, and, shouting, ""You're all fucking feminists,"" opened fire on the women. During a half-hour ram- page, Lepin killed 14 young women, wounded 9 other women and 4 men, and then turned the gun on himself. A three-page suicide note blamed all of his failures on women, whom he felt had rejected him and scorned him. Also found on his body was a hit- list of 15 prominent Canadian women. (p. 13) This horrific crime is almost unanimously agreed to be a hate crime and opened the door for viewing other violence against women as gender-bias hate crime. The rape of women is almost always a hate crime, one exception possibly being statutory rape. Senator Joseph Biden (D-Delaware), pri- mary sponsor of the VAWA, stated, ""Theo- retically, I guess, a rape could take place that was not driven by gender animus, but I can't think of what it would be"" (cited in Gaffney, 1997, p. 260). Gaffney suggested that gender an- imus is present in all sexual assault cases and recommends that courts adopt a rebuttable pre- sumption of gender animus in rape cases. Domestic violence can also fit the hate crime model, as the violence is often a repeated and patterned attack on women. Serial and repeated attacks by a perpetrator are often characteristic of hate crimes. Gender-biased epithets are com- mon during a hate crime assault and such lan- guage is common in domestic abuse of a woman by her male partner (NiCarthy, 1986). Goldscheid (1999) noted that women who are battered are particularly vulnerable when they are pregnant, when their ""femaleness"" is most apparent. She also noted a pattern of battering violence either with one woman over a long pe- riod of time or with multiple women. A man in New Hampshire became the first man in his state to be sentenced under a hate crime law due to gender-biased violence (Jordan, 1994). His history of violence toward women along with repeated referrals to women with ""degrading, McPhail / GENDER-BIAS HATE CRIMES 135 insulting, and intimidating words"" put him in the same category of someone acting out of ra- cial or religious bigotry according to the judge. Again, epithets that target the victim's group status are often a hallmark of hate crimes. Women being attacked are often termed ""bitches,"" ""cunts,"" and ""whores,"" words that target their femaleness. Another hallmark of hate crime is the harm it does to the victim's com- munity in addition to the individual victim(s). For instance, although not all women are raped, most women fear rape (Gordon & Riger, 1989). Women al- ter their daily lives in nu- merous ways to avoid the violent behavior of men. Choundas (1995) noted, ""While potential victims of racial, ethnic, or reli- gious violence might attempt to avoid certain neighborhoods in which prejudice might run particularly rampant, women remain safe from street harassment and violent assault only by staying out of those areas known as public"" (pp. 1090-1091). And yet, even in ""private,"" women are not safe fromthe hands of intimate partners. Again, this intimate relationship often cloaks the reality of the violence. Characteristics of hate crime also include the pervasive social harmsuch acts inflict on society in general. In this case, the pervasive social harmto women includes constant threats of vio- lence and restrictions on freedomto move about the world, which may impinge on economic op- portunities. Domestic violence also inflicts harms on the institution of the family, adds costs and dangers to the workplace, has links to crim- inal and suicidal tendencies, and instills violent propensities in the next generation of males (Choundas, 1995). Another characteristic of hate crime is whether the target community perceives it as a hate crime. This was the case in the following example. In November 1994 at the University of New Mexico's Zimmerman Library, more than 100 bound volumes of gender and gay studies journals were taken, and those left defaced with swastikas and scrawled messages such as ""Where is your bitch propaganda?"" (Hood & Rollins, 1995). Although some university ad- ministrators and faculty saw the crime as a mat- ter of censorship or a prank (especially when the volumes were later found hidden in the library), feminist faculty and staff defined it as a hate crime. The next year, the Board of Regents passed a hate crime policy, which included gen- der as a category, with the library incident noted by local press as a motivating factor. Finally, several other factors, often particu- lars of the crime, make gender-bias violence fit the hate crime paradigm. Levin (Webb, 1994) be- lieved violence against women is a hate crime because it is often characterized by (a) hate lan- guage, (b) the absence of another motive (such as robbery), (c) excessive brutality including genital and breast mutilation, (d) lack of provo- cation, and (e) victims suffer long-term harm. Perpetrators of hate crime are often young men in groups (Levin & McDevitt, 1993), which is of- ten characteristic of violence against women, es- pecially gang rapes. Another criteria of hate crime is that the characteristic the victim is tar- geted for is an immutable one; that is, the person cannot change it. Therefore, the person is pow- erless to avoid being targeted, now or in the fu- ture. Although transgenderists and postmod- ernists would disagree, gender is generally viewed as an immutable trait. Transgendered individuals are often themselves targets of hate crime, and recent legislation in California in- cludes transsexuals as a protected category (Jenness & Grattet, 2001). Gender Inclusion Benefits The policy benefits of having gender as a sta- tus within hate crime policy are numerous. Per- haps the primary benefit is the one cited by Weisburd and Levin (1994), ""By recognizing the group-based animosity underlying these vic- timizations, we not only decry the violence but also take the first step in confronting the under- lying attitude that allows the violence to occur"" (p. 41). The solutions to social problems are de- termined by the definitions attributed to the problems. If the problem is identified as per- sonal and individual, as violence against 136 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE / April 2002 Another hallmark of hate crime is the harm it does to the victim's community in addition to the individual victim(s). For instance, although not all women are raped, most women fear rape. women has been considered for so long, then so- lutions will follow that individualized model. Placing gender in its proper place among hate crimes redefines the problem as public and po- litical, causing the victims to be viewed as wor- thy of legal redress instead of blame. Angelari (1994) listed other benefits includ- ing new legal remedies and increased public awareness of the seriousness and prevalence of violence against women. The new legal reme- dies include increased penalties, which provide incentives for police and prosecutors to take vi- olence against women more seriously, opportu- nities to seek civil remedies, damages in civil award suits to pay for treatment, civil suits offering emotional reward for establishing guilt of the attacker, and offering ""victims of gender bias-motivated violence confirmation that their suffering is part of a greater, and regretfully un- addressed, social problemof violence against women"" (p. 102). A rape survivor hauntingly spoke (Kalven, 1999) of this connection to the larger group of victimized women: ""I feel in touch with something so large. I felt it from the first moments. I feel connected to cavewomen, to women who've been raped through history. It's like a weight, bearing down on me"" (p. 142). The benefit of increasing public awareness of the seriousness of violence against women is that it (a) directs attention away fromrape myths and onto motives of hate, power, and control, (b) shifts attention away fromthe victim and on to the motives and actions of the perpe- trators, and (c) also moves attention away from the relationship and onto the violence. A shift in focus on motivation fromvictimto perpetrator would change the questions asked of the victim from""Why don't you leave?"" and ""What were you wearing?"" to asking the perpetrator ""Why did you target women?"" and ""What part does misogyny play in this violence?"" Also, such a shift changes treatment of the perpetrator in ways already practiced within the feminist com- munity; that is, having rapists or domestic vio- lence abusers recognize that they have more than a problemwith individual women but a problemwith how they view and treat women more generally (Gondolf & Russell, 1987). To increase the rewards of recognizing gen- der as a status category, the interaction of gen- der with other status categories must also be ac- knowledged. Not to do so unnecessary limits the understanding of hate crime as it applies to women and serves to make many women invis- ible, especially women who occupy multiple status categories. GENDER ESSENTIALISM Hate crime policy is largely focused on pro- viding increased protection and remedies for specific, targeted groups of people based pri- marily on a history of discriminatory practices and widespread prejudice expressed toward their group. This division of people into speci- fied categories can be a source of contention. For instance, Jacobs and Potter (1998) criticized such categorization as leading to identity poli- tics and the ""Balkanization of American soci- ety"" (p. 8). Harris also offered a critique of cate- gorization, however, based on a much different premise. Harris (1993) was critical of feminist legal theorists who speak of ""gender"" as though it were both universal and separate from other systems of domination. Harris de- fined ""gender essentialism"" as ""the notion that there is a monolithic 'women's experience' that can be described independent of other facets of experience like race, class, and sexual orienta- tion"" (p. 348). Throughout this article, and much of the hate crime policy domain, status categories are spo- ken of as if they were discrete and separate cate- gories. Such notions not only create divisions between categories of people, they fail to recog- nize that people occupy multiple categories. By ignoring people who fall within multiple tar- geted status categories, it is often women who are made invisible. The FBI defines a multiple- bias incident as ""any hate crime incident in which one or more of the offenses were commit- ted as a result of two or more bias motivations"" (FBI, 1999a, p. 7). However, the category is little used. In 1999, when the FBI reported 9,301 hate crime offenses, only 10 were recorded as multiple-bias incidents. Ignoring multiple status categories in theo- retical discussions as well as statistical report- ing leaves gender out of the picture. For in- stance, Jenness and Broad (1994) noted how the McPhail / GENDER-BIAS HATE CRIMES 137 gay and lesbian antiviolence projects have adopted many of the strategies of the women's movement's antiviolence projects without adopting a gendered understanding of vio- lence. Ault (1997) echoed this point by noting that gay and lesbian antiviolence projects often fail to note the connections between sexual ori- entation and gender discrimination, resulting in the assumption that lesbian women have more in common with gay men than heterosexual women. Another assumption follows: that is, that attacks on gays and lesbians are exclusively due to homophobia and not misogyny. Attacks on gay men may be due to misogyny, due to their perceived similarity with women, as well as homophobia. Hate crimes against lesbian women are often attributed solely to homophobia rather than some combination of homophobia and misog- yny. Such discrete catego- rizations ""create a false dichotomy between the categories 'lesbian' and 'woman' and 'anti-lesbian' and 'anti-woman.' Anti-lesbian is quintessentially anti-woman; vi- olence against women of all sexual orientations is often overtly 'anti-lesbian' "" (Ault, 1997, p. 59). Not including gender as a category creates problems for women who are hate crime vic- tims. Pharr (1990) questioned, When hate crimes are limited to anti-Semitic, racist, and homophobic violence, there is inherent confu- sion: when Jewish women are killed, when women of color are killed, when lesbians are raped or killed, it is often impossible to determine if they were at- tacked because of their reli- gion, race, sexual identity, or their gender. (p. 2) Police often have diffi- culty determining motive when there are multiple identities. In her study of the identification of hate crimes by police officers, Martin (1995) related the problemwith determin- ing motive in the follow- ing two cases involving women of color. In one incident, two African American women were so- liciting for a charity door to door. A White homeowner yelled at them, ""Get the fuck out, niggers!"" and then chased themdown the street while he was naked. The police determined this to be a racial incident because the man yelled ""niggers,"" but noted in their report that he prob- ably would not have done the same to two Afri- can American men. Another incident occurred when a White man in a car yelled, ""move, you Black nigger bitch mother fucker!"" which was recorded by the police as racial harassment. However, the victimis noted to have said, ""If I were a man he wouldn't have done that"" (Mar- tin, 1995, p. 321). Harris listed reasons why gender essential- ismis so attractive: (a) as a matter of intellectual convenience, it is easy; (b) essentialismrepre- sents emotional safety; (c) it provides opportu- nities for power games and hierarchies of op- pression; and (d) cognitively, it provides a way of organizing data, even at the cost of leaving some data and experiences out. Such a gender essentialist focus does have problematic conse- quences in hate crime policy. For instance, en- hanced penalties are often seen as a solution to hate crime, which may disproportionately affect men of color because they are likely to face in- creased discrimination in the criminal justice system(Angelari, 1994). African American women may be less likely to support penalty en- hancements due to their unique vantage point at the intersection of race and gender. Violence against women also may be very different for various subgroups of women. For example, race and rape intersect to make a very different expe- rience, especially for African American women because of the legacy of rape during eras of slav- ery, Reconstruction, and JimCrow (Davis, 1981). Having a checkmark for ""multiple bias"" is not enough. It is more than a bookkeeping or ac- counting problem. The result of category essentialismis that the gendered nature of much violence is once again ignored or marginalized, especially as it affects women who are targeted due to their membership in multiple targeted status categories. The interconnections among 138 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE / April 2002 Hate crimes against lesbian women are often attributed solely to homophobia rather than some combination of homophobia and misogyny. The result of category essentialism is that the gendered nature of much violence is once again ignored or marginalized, especially as it affects women who are targeted due to their membership in multiple targeted status categories. systems of oppression have been brought to the forefront by numerous women of color theo- rists, including Davis (1981) and Collins (2000). Collins used the terms ""intersectionality"" and ""matrix of domination"" to describe the intercon- nections of oppressions. Intersectionality is de- fined as the ""particular forms of intersecting oppressions, for example, intersections of race and gender, or of sexuality and nation"" (p. 18). For example, a female Muslim hate crime victim may be acknowledged, but the bias is often solely attributed to her religion rather than a combination of her gender and religion. In the hate crime literature, the intersections are ig- nored, which often leads to a marginalization of the gendered nature of violence. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH, PRACTICE, AND POLICY Gender as a status category has taken a de- tour on the road to hate crime policy acceptance but is traveling the road nonetheless. Although still not universally included in hate crime pol- icy, gender is frequently included as a status cat- egory. However, victory cannot yet be claimed. There are still struggles ahead to keep gender in the paradigm, to see that the policy is effectively implemented, and to face the new challenges that lie ahead. There is concern that the policies will be viewed as more symbolic rather than to be practically implemented. There is also con- cern about the institutionalization of these poli- cies as the law enforcement community imple- ments them. The implications for research, practice, and policy will be discussed. Research Because the hate crime domain is still in its in- fancy, research is needed in all areas of hate crime in general and gender bias in particular. Currently, much of the literature on gender-bias violence consists of conceptual arguments within legal circles and little empirical research. The research focus must include gender bias and the multiple statuses of many targeted women. One specific research suggestion in- cludes surveying law enforcement officials to determine their knowledge of, and interest in, identifying and prosecuting gender-bias hate crimes. Additional calls for research are in- cluded in two new hate crime reports (Green, McFalls, & Smith, 2001; McDevitt, Balboni, & Bennett, 2000). Practice Practice implications include developing and implementing training programs for police offi- cers, judges, and prosecutors on gender-bias crimes. Although hate crime training is avail- able, often it does not include the category of gender. Such training also would need to be evaluated to determine its effectiveness in rais- ing both awareness and knowledge of gender- bias hate crimes and whether that awareness or knowledge translates into specific actions and protections for women. Models for training could include programs often provided by women's rape crisis and domestic violence pro- grams to police cadets and officers. Theoretical models most appropriate would be radical fem- inist theory or social dominance theory (SDT). SDT posits that all human societies are struc- tured as systems of group-based hierarchies, which includes a gender systemin which males have disproportionate power over females (Sidanius & Pratto, 1999). Education for the gen- eral public would also be beneficial. Programs addressed to elementary, secondary, and higher education students could focus on preventing hate crimes through increased acceptance and tolerance while dismantling hierarchies and promoting equality. Because women's organizations were shut out of the initial policy process, they must be in- vited into the process. Because the gender com- ponent came from top-down rather than from women's activists, a first step might be for women's organizations to learn about how gen- der fits within the hate crime paradigm. Al- though this is occurring at the national level among women's organizations, it does not ap- pear to be happening at the state and local lev- els. A discussion should ensue on how to best address violence against women to ensure the best use of scarce resources. Women's organiza- tions must be informed about the potential ben- efits of categorizing violence against women as McPhail / GENDER-BIAS HATE CRIMES 139 gender-bias hate crimes. Armed with such knowledge, women's organizations can once again take the lead in both training and moni- toring the implementation of the law. Maroney (1998) suggested advocacy groups develop leadership at the regional and national levels, formlong-lasting coalitions and resist di- visiveness between status categories, and resist seeing hate crime legislation as an end unto it- self or a substitute for real systemic change. Elaborating on the last point, Maroney re- minded us, It is possible to support anti-hate crime measures without supporting the more controversial and resource-heavy demands of disenfranchised groups for equality in housing, education, wealth, and sex- ual freedoms. Doing so allows government authori- ties to condemn the most extreme manifestations of prejudice without committing to eradication of lesser, more pervasive forms. (pp. 584-585) Addressing discriminatory violence against women is merely one piece of a wider agenda to improve the status of women. Policy Another focus must be on policy. The focus on policy must include monitoring the imple- mentation of hate crime policy, including the possibility of unintended consequences. Policy concerns include continuing to add gender as a status category to state and federal policies as well as revising FBI and other guidelines to in- clude gender examples. Women's organizations can join with hate crime coalitions to work on a state-by-state basis to ensure gender is a status category in all 50 states. Maroney (1998) cau- tioned that hate crime law is now in the hands of the criminal justice system whose views of hate crime might differ from the advocacy groups that successfully proposed the laws. One con- cern is that the law may be used to against those people it was intended to protect. Angelari (1994) noted that policies meant to protect women have had unintended consequences, such as the dual arrests of both parties under mandatory arrest policies in domestic violence cases. Monitoring policy implementation is nec- essary to see that legislative intent is carried out and that no unintended consequences befall women as a class. McDevitt et al. (2000) suggested that the FBI convene a working group to discuss the inclu- sion of gender in its national report because many states are beginning to collect local statis- tics. Statistics on violence against women are notoriously underreported and subject to con- troversy. Including the number of women who are victims of gender-bias assaults in the na- tional report will pose unique difficulties. The FBI and other law enforcement guidelines must also be rewritten to include examples that in- clude gender. Such examples might include adding ""Take Back the Night Marches"" to gay and lesbian pride parades and Martin Luther King, Jr. Day celebrations. It would include add- ing gender-bias epithets or other comments in- cluding stereotypical and derogatory state- ments about women as a class or group. Such statements often include blaming women for provoking or deserving the attack and blaming women for the perpetrator's present position or difficulties either during the commission or af- ter the commission of the crime. Again, the mul- tiple statuses of women must be taken into ac- count in developing the FBI guidelines. That is, investigators must ask if the crime was moti- vated in part by the victim's race, religion, or sexual orientation, but also in conjunction with the victim's gender. Maroney (1998) warned of the potential dan- ger when hate crime becomes institutionalized. Anti-hate crime efforts, once adopted, have come firmly within the control of the legislators, govern- ment authorities, police, prosecutors, and judges that shape and implement them. That institutional control, coupled with inadequate movement activity outside of those institutions, has frustrated larger at- tempts to alter systemic mistreatment of hate crime. (p. 598) Maroney detailed many present and potential problems, such as the bias of police officers, prosecutors, and judges who have much discre- tion; law enforcement's tendency to only ad- dress ""extraordinary cases""; the possibility of selective enforcement with target communities having the laws turned against them; and the irony of having the police, who are guilty of 140 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE / April 2002 many hate crimes themselves, responsible for apprehending other bias offenders. This latter situation is directly applicable to violence against women as police officers have fre- quently been charged with domestic violence, rape, sexual harassment, and other misogynist assaults either against women in their personal lives or women they encounter in the course of their work. Gelber (2000) raised different concerns about hate crime policies: ""While the logic of hate crime categorisation seems readily extendable to incorporate certain crimes against women, the hate crime argument begins to raise ques- tions which challenge assumptions about the usefulness of hate crime legislation."" She is con- cerned about how the laws might be applied in- appropriately or inconsistently, also sharing concerns that penalty-enhancement laws might disproportionately punish already marginal- ized populations. Gelber suggested a shift in fo- cus to monitoring hate crimes, community edu- cation to raise awareness, and greater provision of services to victims. CONCLUSION Clearly, the case for gender fitting a hate crime paradigm can be made. However, there is much room to debate when and how it should be incorporated into the violence against women movement. There is a danger that in incorporat- ing women into the hate crime paradigm, the model is stretched so thin that it collapses. The gender bias hate crime model is in its infancy; much work needs to be done to assess its effec- tiveness in its adolescence. Violence against women is a serious problem. Only time and con- tinued analyses will tell if the hate crime para- digmoffers effective solutions and strategies for violence against women rather than a symbolic gesture with few real protections. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE, POLICY, AND RESEARCH Much more research is needed to fully understand all aspects of hate crimes, especially as it concerns vi- olence against women. Such research could include surveys of police and prosecutors to determine their level of knowledge of, and commitment to, prosecut- ing gender-bias crimes. Because the hate crime laws on the books are so new, it is imperative to monitor and evaluate the effects of the policy to determine if the policy is being used and how or whether the policy will remain a sym- bolic gesture, especially with regard to women. Training materials must be developed for law en- forcement personnel, including police officers, pros- ecutors, and judges, that specifically address gender-bias hate crimes. The effectiveness of such training must be evaluated. Because most state and local women's organizations were not on the forefront of the movement to add gender as a status category to hate crime policy, women's advocacy groups must be educated about the possibilities of gender-bias hate crime policy and become involved in the monitoring of policy imple- mentation as well as the training of law enforcement officials. Better data collection must be mandated to enable researchers and advocates to track the number of hate crimes reported, the number of hate crimes charged, and the subsequent number of prosecu- tions, both successful and unsuccessful, including the category of gender. The FBI must begin to in- clude gender-bias hate crimes and gender examples in the guidelines in its data collection efforts. Advocacy at both the state and federal level is neces- sary to ensure that gender as a status category con- tinues to be proposed and adopted in subsequent hate crime legislation. Fewer than half of the states currently include gender as a status category. A greater understanding of multiple status catego- ries is necessary to determine the interaction be- tween gender and other status categories such as race, religion, and sexual orientation. Training of law enforcement personnel must include this vital topic. Training in gender-bias crimes must also include public awareness and education. Common percep- tions of violence against women lead members of the public to ask, ""What was she wearing when she was raped?"" in instances of sexual assault and, ""Why doesn't she just leave?"" in instances of domes- tic violence. Through the lens of the hate crime para- digm, more appropriate questions would look at the motivations of the perpetrator rather than the vic- tim, asking, ""Did he select a victim based on gen- McPhail / GENDER-BIAS HATE CRIMES 141 Clearly, the case for gender fitting a hate crime paradigm can be made. However, there is much room to debate when and how it should be incorporated into the violence against women movement. der?"" and ""Does he have a pattern of assaults upon women?"" Treatment programs for offenders and victim ser- vices must include the radical feminist theoretical model in their work to acknowledge the root cause of much violence against women, in which women are often targeted due to their gender and men are often perpetrators due to their enforcement of gen- der hierarchies. This model best fits within the hate crime paradigm and addresses the political nature of violence against women. REFERENCES Angelari, M. (1994).

Syracuse University reported 12 hate and bias incidents on campus in 2019, according to the university's annual safety and security report released Tuesday. Of the 12 incidents, nine involved property damage and three involved intimidation. The university also reported one bias-related aggravated assault and one intimidation incident on public property. #NotAgainSU, a movement led by Black students, protested the more than 30racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic incidents that occurred at or near SU starting in November 2019. The bias and hate incidents reported in 2019 show a dramatic increase from previous years. In 2018, the university reported two intimidation incidents on campus. The university also reported 10 rapes and five reports of fondling on campus in 2019, the same number of offenses as the previous year. Dating violence offenses on campus increased by two, with eight reported incidents on campus in 2019. The number of stalking incidents reported on campus decreased to eight, two less than 2018.Burglaries, motor vehicle theft and arson reports all decreased from 2018. There were seven burglaries, three vehicle thefts and no arson reports in 2019. Aggravated assault and robberies reported in 2019 both remained the same as 2018, with two reports of each. Drug and liquor law violations also continued to decrease in 2019. The university reported two drug law violation arrests and 71 disciplinary referrals from drug violations in 2019. SU reported 440 liquor law violations that all resulted in disciplinary action. SU also reported one disciplinary referral for possession of an illegal weapon. SU reported no crimes at its New York City, Washington D.C., Los Angeles andinternational campuses. https://donate.dailyorange.com/ The post 12 hate crimes, bias incidents reported on SU campus in 2019, new data says[2] appeared first on The Daily Orange[3].

Approximately one third of the cases are unclassifiable according to the typology. Findings indicate that the typology is useful for understanding cases in which bias is the sole motivation but inadequate for application to the many cases in which bias is a peripheral motivation. bias crimes hate crimes crime typology prosecution of hate crimes O ver the past few decades, there has been increased public debate con- cerning bias-motivated crimes as well as the development of legislation in virtually every state to combat such crimes (Jenness & Grattet, 2001). in virtually every state to combat such crimes (Jenness & Grattet, 2001). Currently, despite the president's veto threat, a bill is pending in Congress that will add gender, sexual orientation, and gender identity to the federal hate crime legislation (Stout, 2007). Despite the proliferation of legislation designed to combat hate crimes, few empirical studies have addressed the prosecution of hate crimes. In an effort to fill the void, this article contributes to the literature in two ways. First, it examines court data for all cases referred by investigators for prosecution as bias crimes in one New Jersey county between 2001 and 2004. Author's Note: Correspondence concerning this article should be addressed to Nickie D. Phillips, Department of Sociology and Criminal Justice, St. Francis College, 180 Remsen Street, Brooklyn, NY 11201; e-mail: nphillips@stfranciscollege.edu 884 These cases represent 5% of the 643 cases referred to investigators as poten- tial bias crimes. Second, it appears that this is the first empirical study apply- ing Levin and McDevitt's (1993, 2002) hate crime typology to cases occurring outside of Boston. Preliminary findings indicate that the typology is incom- plete because it fails to account for a large number of cases that were prose- cuted as bias crimes in this jurisdiction. In general, bias crimes are defined as crimes “that manifest evidence of prejudice based on race, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity” (Federal Bureau of Investigation [FBI], 2006). According to the most recent Uniform Crime Report's hate crime statistics, 8,380 hate crime offenses had occurred nationwide in 2005. However, scholars agree that bias-motivated crimes are underreported (Berk, Boyd, & Hamner, 1992; Garcia, McDevitt, Gu, & Balboni, 2003; Herek & Berrill, 1992; McDevitt et al., 2000). For example, Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) has estimated as many as 50,000 bias- motivated crimes per year, whereas the findings of National Crime Victimization Survey indicated that only about 44% of the 210,000 hate crime victimizations from July 2000 through December 2003 were reported to police (Harlow, 2005, p. 1: Southern Poverty Law Center, n.d.). Although bias crimes are believed to be underreported, they are a small percentage of the total crimes that occur. Specifically, Harlow (2005) had estimated that bias crimes comprised only “3% of all violent crimes revealed to the NCVS [National Crime Victimization Survey] by victims” (p. 1). Although bias crimes occur relatively infrequently, proponents of bias crime legislation argue that such crimes are qualitatively different from nonbias crimes and are therefore deserving of more severe punishment (Herek & Berrill, 1992; Lawrence, 1999; Levin, 1999). Enforcement of Bias Crime Legislation Prior research found much variability in the way law enforcement per- sonnel have interpreted and enforced laws prohibiting bias crimes. For example, Jenness and Grattet (2005) examined the various factors influenc- ing the extent to which hate crime policies developed at the local level across the state of California. The researchers found that organizational pervi- ousness, as measured by the presence of community group meetings, commu- nity policing practices, and workplace heterogeneity, was the strongest predictor of having a policy (Jenness & Grattet, 2005). Although having a department policy indicated some effort to formally address bias crimes, it did not necessarily translate into actual enforcement. 885 Haider-Markel (2002) surveyed police departments and district attor- neys across the nation about their perception of the enforcement of anti- gay/lesbian–bias crime legislation. According to the survey results, factors such as hate crime training for law enforcement, favorable attitudes toward enforcement of officers and supervisors, belief that enforcement has an impact on the level of hate crime, and the presence of state hate crime leg- islation were found to impact the enforcement of hate crime legislation. The above suggests that the development of hate crime policies and subse- quent implementation varies across jurisdictions. The enforcement of bias crime legislation is contingent on decision making by various actors at numer- ous stages, all influenced by the social context from which they operate. For example, to enforce bias crime legislation, incidents must be reported to law enforcement officers and classified as bias-motivated crimes. Research has indicated that classification and investigation procedures vary by department (Boyd, Berk, & Hamner, 1996; Martin, 1995). Furthermore, researchers examining the enforcement of bias crimes have noted that both investigators and prosecutors tend to look for the “perfect” case when enforcing bias crime legislation (Bell, 2002; Boyd et al., 1996; Levin & McDevitt, 2002). For example, Boyd et al. reported that investigators in one division developed a conception of a “true” or “normal” bias crime (p. 835). The investigators described true bias crimes as sharing the following characteristics: a lack of provocation by the victim, a lack of prior relationship between the offender and victim, and “a specific target, and accompanying derogatory insults” (Boyd et al., 1996, p. 835). The other division defined bias crime more broadly, classifying cases as bias motivated if there was even a “single ele- ment” indicating bias motivation (Boyd et al., 1996, p. 843). Similarly, other researchers have suggested that prosecutors are likely to only charge bias crimes in “perfect” cases or those in which “the evidence of bias is overwhelming” (Bell, 2002; Maroney, 1998, p. 604; see also Levin & McDevitt, p. 183). Maroney suggested that investigators and prosecutors will be quick to weed out “mixed-motive” cases, defined as those in which there is the presence of some motive other than bias. Maroney further suggested that both will reject such cases “even though many hate crime laws and departmen- tal protocols explicitly provide for inclusion of such crimes” (p. 604). Despite the effort by investigators to screen out problematic cases, Martin (1996), in her examination of hate crime incidents in Baltimore County, found that ambiguous cases remained for which investigators had to make a determination and “judgment about First Amendment issues that have vexed constitutional scholars” (p. 317). Thus, crimes in which bias is expressed, but not the primary motivation, present problems for investiga- tors and prosecutors in the enforcement of hate crime legislation. 886 Hate Crime Typology Typologies are developed and used to conceptualize and classify informa- tion in meaningful ways. Specifically, typologies have been developed for var- ious crimes such as rape, terrorism, domestic violence, and homicide (Groth & Birnbaum, 1979; Holmes & Holmes, 1998; Holtzworth-Munroe, Meehan, Herron, Rehman, & Stuart, 2000; Hudson, 1999; McCabe & Wauchope, 2005). One of the earliest efforts to focus on bias crimes included the seminal book by Levin and McDevitt (1993), Hate Crimes: The Rising Tide of Bigotry and Bloodshed. Levin and McDevitt examined the cultural influences on those that harbor bigotry and illustrated how bigotry manifests itself in violence. The book contributed to our understanding of hate crimes, by exploring the motiva- tions and patterns of violence, seemingly propelled by bigotry and prejudice and directed toward those viewed as different or the Other. Specifically, the authors developed a typology based on offender motivation. The typology, designed as an aid toward understanding the motivation of hate crime offenders, has been widely cited by scholars and has appeared in law enforcement training materials (American Prosecutors Research Institute [APRI], 2000; Gerstenfeld, 2004; McDevitt, Levin, & Bennet, 2002; McLaughlin, Malloy, Brilliant, & Lang, 2000; Perry, 2003; Shively, 2005; Wessler, 2000). For example, according to the training curriculum featured in McLaughlin et al.'s “Responding to Hate Crime: A Multidisciplinary Curricu- lum,” the typology has been used to do the following: assist law enforcement in identifying suspects, locate offenders, gain insight into the victim's percep- tion of his or her vulnerability, gain insight into the offender's motivation, determine the probability of escalation, and anticipate community response (p. 48). The curriculum suggest that whereas offenders may fit into more than one category, the typology assists in recognizing typical hate crimes. The typology is also referenced in the American Prosecutors Research Institute's A Local Prosecutor's Guide for Responding to Hate Crime as aiding officers to identify potential offenders. Levin and McDevitt's (1993) original typology consisted of three cate- gories: thrill, reactive (or defensive), and mission crimes. It was later updated to include a fourth category, retaliatory crimes (McDevitt et al., 2002). Thrill crimes were described as criminal behavior “set off by a desire for excitement and power” in McDevitt et al. (p. 306) and to have “some fun” and “to stir up a little excitement . . . at someone else's expense” in Levin and McDevitt (p. 65). Reactive crimes, later renamed defensive, were characterized by those in which the offender feels threatened by outsiders encroaching on their “com- munity, means of livelihood, or way of life” (Levin & McDevitt, p. 76). Such 887 crimes were considered a response to a threat to the offender's resources, such as minorities moving into a homogenous neighborhood. Mission crimes were described as those in which the offender believed the victim was “evil” and needed to be destroyed (Levin & McDevitt, p. 89). This often, but not neces- sarily, involved allegiance to a particular bias-related group or ideology. Retaliatory crimes were said to be sparked by “a desire to avenge a perceived degradation or assault on their group” (McDevitt et al., 2002, p. 306). Retaliatory crimes referred “specifically to incidents in which offenders act in response to a [real or perceived] hate crime” (McDevitt et al., 2002, p. 309). In their updated work, Hate Crimes Revisited: America's War on Those Who Are Different, Levin and McDevitt (2002) devoted a chapter to each cat- egory of the typology, offering numerous examples of crimes that have occurred across the nation. Many of the cases received significant media atten- tion such as Tom and John Metzger's involvement in the murder of Mulugeta Seraw (mission category) as well as the murder of Yusuf Hawkins in Bensonhurst, New York by a group of White young men (defensive category). In 2002, McDevitt et al. (2002) applied the typology to 169 cases reported and investigated as bias motivated by the Boston Police Department. Of the 169 cases, 111 were categorized by the researchers as thrill, 43 as defensive, 14 as retaliatory, and 1 as mission. The typology has been widely cited and used in training curriculum. Beyond the original authors, however, there are no empirical studies in which the typology has been systematically applied to a universe of cases forwarded to prosecutors in a particular jurisdiction. As Gerstenfeld (2004) stated, “its utility and meaning remain to be found” (p. 77; Shively, 2005). As such, the applicability of the typology must continue to be tested by researchers who are able to gain access to prosecutorial information about hate crimes in local jurisdictions. Despite its widespread use, the hate crime typology has some clear limi- tations. The categories are not mutually exclusive and various categories overlap. For example, in three of the four categories, the offender is likely to seek a location where victims congregate or are located. Similarly, in three of the four categories, peer influence is an important characteristic. Only in the retaliatory category is there a tendency that the offender will act alone. Furthermore, the typology omits cases in which bias is a peripheral com- ponent to the crime. For example, Martin (1995) found that although in some cases bias is expressed during the crime, it is not the primary cause of crime. Scholars have pointed out that the conception and definition of hate crime, specifically the determination of motive, is fraught with difficulty (Berk et al., 1992; Green, McFalls, & Smith, 2001; Jacobs, 1992-1993). Jacobs and Potter 888 Table 1 Levin & McDevitt's Hate Crime Typology Source: Levin and McDevitt (1993), and McDevitt, Levin, and Bennett (2002). a. Category added by McDevitt et al. (2002). The authors argued that retaliatory hate crimes tend to have greatest potential for fueling and refueling additional hate offenses. 889 (1998), who warned of the difficulty in investigating and classifying bias crimes, presented the dilemma in one concise statement: “Must the criminal conduct have been totally, primarily, substantially, or just slightly caused by prejudiced motivation?” (p. 21). Furthermore, Jacobs stated that, in effect, “Practically any crime committed by a member of one group against a member of another qualifies for investigation as a hate crime” (Jacobs, 1992- 1993, p. 548). Excluding cases in which bias is a peripheral component reduces the possibility of having an unwieldy typology. However, there is a lack of research documenting what types of cases are actually prosecuted as bias crimes. If many cases that involve bias as a peripheral motivation are in fact prosecuted as bias crimes, the typology may be of limited usefulness in this context. Method Data on hate crime incidents and offenses are collected from local law enforcement agencies and disseminated annually by the FBI. The FBI data are limited to aggregate measures of incidents and arrests, and contain no information on case processing. Unfortunately, there is no annual national database of hate crime prosecutions and convictions. Furthermore, the def- inition of hate crime varies among jurisdictions, and few states provide databases in which hate crime case processing and outcome information are provided. Instead, researchers must approach individual jurisdictions for access to case-processing data in disaggregate form. This study is the first systematic application of the typology to all cases prosecuted as bias crimes in a particular county over a 4-year period. These cases were determined by investigators to meet the criteria of a bias crime and, as a result, were referred to prosecutors. These cases represent 5% of the total cases examined by investigators during the study period. The pur- pose of the study is to provide an empirical test of the usefulness of the typology as it pertains to cases prosecuted as bias crimes. A jurisdiction in New Jersey was chosen because it has been identified as a leader in addressing bias crimes. It was among the first to develop a bias crime unit on the East Coast. The county has a population of more than 250,000, which is relatively affluent, with a median household income greater than the national median. In terms of race/ethnicity, the majority of the popula- tion is categorized as White. Blacks comprise the largest minority popula- tion, with Hispanic or Latino persons comprising less than 10% of the population (U.S. Census Bureau, 2000). The crime rate in the county is 890 slightly lower than the crime rate for the state of New Jersey (New Jersey State Police, 2005). This research involved the analysis of the files pertaining to all cases referred for prosecution as bias crimes between 2001 and 2004. These 30 cases were considered by investigators as the only cases suitable for bias crime prosecution out of a total of 643 cases originally investigated.2 As such, the cases in the current study have met the legal rigors of inclusion according to the New Jersey statute. They were judged by police and pros- ecutors who specialize in bias crimes as exhibiting legal characteristics of a bias crime. Therefore, the cases were by definition the least ambiguous from a legal standpoint and as such should be classifiable according to the hate crime typology. According to investigators, each case referred met the cri- teria as indicated in the New Jersey's Bias Incident Investigative Standards (BIIS; 2000). According to BIIS, a bias incident is defined as any suspected or confirmed offense or unlawful act which occurs to a person, private property, or public property on the basis of race, color, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity. An offense is bias based if the motive for the commission of the offense or unlawful act pertains to race, color, religion, gender, handicap, sexual orientation, or ethnicity (BIIS 2000, p. 9). By way of background, the bias unit in this county consists of two full- time investigators along with two officers that fill in when the designated investigators are unavailable. The unit is responsible for investigating all bias-motivated incidents (criminal and noncriminal), outreach to the com- munity and local schools in the form of workshops or presentations, and bias training for police officers. Potential bias-motivated crimes reach the bias unit through a variety of sources. The Office of Bias Crimes and Community Relations operates a statewide bias hotline in which victims may report bias-related incidents that are then forwarded to the appropriate jurisdiction. Furthermore, following a memorandum of agreement between the Department of Law and Public Safety and the Department of Education (New Jersey Administrative Code [N.J.A.C.], 6:29-10.1), schools in New Jersey are mandated to report all allegations of bias-motivated incidents to law enforcement. Finally, all police agencies in the county are required to forward all reported bias-motivated crimes to the bias unit at the county prosecutor's office. Once identified and confirmed as bias motivated by investigators, a case may be referred for prosecution as a bias crime. The New Jersey Bias Intimidation statute defines a bias crime as an offense committed “with a pur- pose to intimidate an individual or group of individuals because of race, color, religion, gender, handicap, sexual orientation, or ethnicity or knowing that the 891 conduct constituting the offense would cause an individual or group of indi- viduals to be intimidated because of race, color, religion, gender, handicap, sexual orientation, or ethnicity” (New Jersey Statute [NJS], 2C:16-1). The BIIS (2000, p. 15) also contains guidelines for confirming incidents of bias. Investigators are instructed to consider, for example, the totality of the circumstances, note any statements made by the suspect or witnesses, and look for bias symbols, words, graffiti, or other types of evidence. To classify cases, the investigators look for other motives for the incident, that is, whether the offenders are members of a hate group, whether the victim and offender share identities (e.g., racial, religious, or ethnic group identi- ties), and whether the victim recently moved into the area. Information on cases was retrieved from both investigative and prosecutor case files. Investigative case files typically contained a cover sheet that included preliminary information regarding case characteristics, offender(s) and victim(s) characteristics, initial police report, and any subsequent investiga- tive materials such as transcripts of interviews with offender(s), victim(s), and witnesses. The prosecutor's case files typically contained information on the proposed indictment, grand jury decisions, a plea sheet, criminal history reports, sentence received, and copies of the investigative materials. Information coded from case files included the following: type of bias motivation (race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and gender), type of offense, location, number of offenders/ victims, victim injury, age and race of offender/victim, charges, and case disposition. This research entailed analyzing case file information and investigators' narratives, and coding those details according to McDevitt et al.'s (2002) bias crime typology (see also Levin & McDevitt, 1993).3 As previously mentioned, the characteristics of each category are noted in Table 1. In classifying cases into the typology, I followed as closely as possible the characteristics and examples provided in Levin and McDevitt, and McDevitt et al. Case narratives and interview transcripts of offenders, victims, and witnesses were examined to gain information pertaining to the triggering event, goal, peer influence, tar- geted victims, and typical location (see Table 1). The triggering event refers to any event that either precipitated, or acted as a catalyst to the behavior on the part of the offender. The goal refers to the underlying rationale for the behav- ior on the part of the offender (e.g., to rid the world of evil or to protect their neighborhood from outsiders). Peer influence, targeted victims, and location were noted for each case. However, the typology contains overlapping cate- gories, making difficult the task of straightforward classification of cases into distinct categories. For example, both reactive/defensive and retaliatory hate 892 crimes may involve a precipitating or triggering event. Similarly, peer influ- ence is characteristic of thrill, mission, and reactive/defensive categories. Cases in which there was no clear indication of the goal on the part of the offender were coded as unclassifiable. Results Of the total 643 cases presented to the bias unit between 2001 and 2004, 30 (less than 5%) were referred by the bias unit for prosecution as bias crimes. Although the data from the current study were limited to one juris- diction, this study includes the entire population of cases referred for prosecution as bias crimes between 2001 and 2004 (N = 30). Descriptive information for these cases is displayed in Table 2.4 Racial and religiously motivated crimes comprised 63% of the total cases. The number of offend- ers per case ranged from 1 to 4, with an average of 1.87 offenders. Nearly half of the cases involved a single offender, slightly under one fourth of the cases involved two offenders, and only two cases involved four offenders (see Table 2).55 Previous research has indicated that bias crimes are typically relatively low-level offenses (Garofalo & Martin, 1993). The cases presented for prose- cution in the current study were no exception. The prosecutor's office was unable to retrieve five files, therefore, case outcome information was restricted to cases in which files were available. Of these 25 cases, 23 involved at least one offender charged with a bias crime and the remaining 2 resulted in crimi- nal charges but not bias charges. Although the average number of offenders per case charged with a criminal offense was 2.0, the average number of offenders charged with a bias offense was 1.87. The average number of offenders convicted per case for a bias offense was 0.96 (see Table 3). Due to the small numbers of cases referred for prosecution as bias crimes during the 4-year period, it was not possible to conduct sophisti- cated statistical analyses to determine the impact of independent variables on conviction rates. However, identifiable patterns did emerge from the analysis. Of the cases resulting in a bias charge, religiously motivated and multibias cases were more likely to result in conviction than racially moti- vated cases (see Table 4). Nearly half of the cases that resulted in bias crime charges were catego- rized as juvenile cases (11 out of 23 cases). Juveniles were more likely than adults to be involved in property crimes than personal crimes. Furthermore, cases involving juveniles were more likely to result in conviction for a bias 893 Table 2 Case Characteristics a. Multibias cases refer to cases involving any combination of racial, religious, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or gender bias occurring within one incident. b. Cases were classified as juvenile or adult based on whether the offender was juvenile or adult (18 years or older) at the time of the crime. In cases with more than one offender, cases were coded according to the age of the majority of offenders. In cases in which there was a combination of juvenile and adult offenders, the age gap was generally not greater than 1 year. 894 Table 3 Charges and Convictions per Case Table 4 Bias Crime Typology a. The prosecutor's office was unable to locate files for five cases, therefore, case outcome information was not available for those cases. crime than adult cases. Correspondingly, cases involving property crimes were more likely to result in at least one offender conviction for a bias crime. One possible reason why cases involving juveniles were more likely to result in a bias conviction may relate to the extent to which the grand jury was reluctant to return an indictment on a bias charge for adult offenders. 895 It is also possible that juveniles committed crimes in which bias was likely to be perceived as the sole motivation for the crime and therefore more likely to result in conviction. Case Typology The hate crime typology was applied to the 30 cases referred for prose- cution by the bias unit. Two independent raters coded the cases, with 73% agreement. According to Rubin and Babbie (2004), a 70% agreement rate is considered acceptable. Of the 30 cases referred for prosecution by the bias unit, 13 were coded as motivated by thrill, 4 as mission, 1 as defensive, and 1 as retaliation (see Table 4). The remaining cases were simply unclassifiable. Many cases did not fit any of the four predesignated categories of the typology. Many cases eluded the thrill category because there was no apparent evidence that the offender set out to get kicks or to “stir up a little excitement” (Levin & McDevitt, 2002, p. 67). Rather, the bias appeared to emerge due to an interpersonal confrontation with the victim. Furthermore, although the behaviors often appeared retaliatory in scope because they occurred in the context of ongoing interpersonal con- frontations, they were distinguishable from McDevitt et al.'s (2002) concept of “retaliation,” which refers “specifically to incidents in which offenders act in response to a hate crime” (p. 309). In other words, bias was a peripheral com- ponent, emerging during the context of an already existing interpersonal confrontation. Of the cases in which outcomes were known, eight thrill cases and two mission cases resulted in a bias conviction. However, not surprisingly, of the cases that were unclassifiable—and arguably falling outside the concep- tion of the typical hate crime—only one resulted in a bias conviction (see Table 4). Thrill Of the 30 cases 13 (43%) were categorized as motivated by thrill. The cases appeared to have no clear precipitating event, and the vast majority of thrill cases involved more than one offender. Such cases usually involved juveniles (77%) and frequently involved property crimes (69%). Of 13 cases, 7 (54%) were motivated by bias against religion, with the majority evidencing anti-Jewish bias. In eight of the thrill cases at least one offender was convicted of a bias offense. 896 An example of a thrill case involved three juvenile offenders who spray painted swastikas and other graffiti (e.g., “f . . .”) on vehicles parked in the vic- tim's driveway. The victims were Jews and had decorated their house with Hanukkah decorations for the holiday. According to the investigation report, the victims expressed concern that they “were being targeted for some type of violence.” Case files revealed that the juveniles “just thought it would be funny” to paint swastikas. One juvenile erased his own graffiti and stated that he participated because he thought it would be “harmless fun.” Another thrill case involved three juvenile males and one adult male offender driving around throwing rocks and yelling out racial epithets at passersby. The racially offensive remarks included “n . . . ,” “spic,” “spic, I'm going to f . . . your mother,” and “go back to your own country.” According to the case files, the offenders denied racial prejudice. However, when asked to describe their behavior, they stated that they were playing “screamers” which they described as a game in which they drive “around to random people and scream gibberish at them or whatever is in our heads to scream or whatever is on the radio to get a reaction.” When asked why this particular location was chosen for “screamers,” one juvenile stated because the area “has everybody, Chinese, Black, Spanish, Native American, everybody.” However, when asked if he was a racist, the juvenile replied, “hell no.” According to the offenders, all minorities are not equally susceptible to being victimized and the offend- ers explained that the game does have rules; the victims off-limits for “scream- ers” are little children and the elderly. Retaliation Retaliatory cases are those in which the offender is responding to a real or perceived attack against members of their own group. The single retalia- tory case was in response to the 9/11 attacks in the United States and was directed toward an Islamic center. The center received a series of harassing and threatening answering-machine messages. The offender was charged with bias harassment. The offender admitted to making the call and stated that he was “angry beyond words” and that he “spewed some venom that I'm embarrassed by . . . it was a knee-jerk reaction.” Defensive McDevitt et al. (2002) described defensive cases as those in which the offender is clearly concerned with protecting his community from “those he considered to be outsiders or intruders” (p. 308). The following single case 897 provides an example of a defensive bias crime. The case involved an ongo- ing dispute between two members on a planning board. Both parties filed various complaints against each other. The case involved harassing answering- machine messages left by the offender that indicated the offender would drop the lawsuit if the victim removed herself from the planning board. The message stated, “We don't need Syrians on the planning board,” and “It will be sending a message to your people, and that [this town] is going to be tough on them.” Mission McDevitt et al. (2002) described the mission category as cases in which “the perpetrator seeks to rid the world of evil” (p. 309). Mission hate crimes are frequently committed by members of organized hate groups and may include offenders exhibiting symptoms of mental illness. Only four cases in the current study were categorized as mission. Two related cases categorized as mission involved youths that created their own hate group and had defined their own criteria for membership. The youth engaged in numerous acts of criminal mischief and other prop- erty crimes. Graffiti was sprayed on the nearby bridge and included various swastikas, pentagrams, and the phrase, “God sucks ass.” Furthermore, the youth knocked over a statue of the Mother Mary and removed the head of the statue. The juveniles scrawled graffiti at various locations, including a church and surrounding vehicles, and buildings, fences, and roadways. The graffiti was at times pointedly bias and included drawings of swastikas and pentagrams as well as phrases such as “N . . . s shall die,” “Nazi,” “white power n . . . s beware,” and so on. However, much of the graffiti was unrelated to bias and included phrases such as “big penises rock,” “S . . . sucks pussy,” “This car makes dingy noises,” “f . . . the world,” “God sucks ass,” and “Satan is my lover.” A few mission cases involved offenders exhibiting symptoms of mental illness. One case involved victims traveling on a highway. As the offender's vehicle approached, the offender threw a water bottle at the victim's vehi- cle. At the next light, the offender exited his vehicle and swung the drive shaft from his vehicle, striking the victim's car on the hood. The accused stated that he was working for the FBI and thought that the victims were Arabs and were harassing him. He stated he was an assassin assigned to kill Osama Bin Laden and he had recently hired gods to “take him out.” The case files indicated that the offender was delusional, exhibiting symptoms of mental illness. 898 Unclassifiable The following section describes cases in which bias seemed peripheral to the crime and the offender's actions appeared to be a direct response to the victim's actions immediately preceding the crime. Such cases were sim- ply unclassifiable and did not fit the typology. As a result, these cases cre- ate difficulties for prosecutors. This is problematic because more than one third of the cases referred from the bias unit fall into this category. All of the unclassifiable cases were comprised of adult offenders. Of the 11I unclassifiable cases, 10 consisted of personal crimes. Of the 23 cases in which at least one offender was charged with a bias crime, only one of the seven unclassifiable cases ended in a bias conviction for at least one offender. One case involved a victim and her 2-year-old grandson who pulled into the parking lot of a convenience store. As the victim parked, two offenders in a nearby vehicle stated, “Why didn't you park straight” and added, “Bitch, why can't you park straight, I can't get out, n . . . .” One offender entered the con- venience store to purchase a cup of coffee and returned to the vehicle. The vic- tim stated to the offender, “You need to tell your girlfriend to have more manners,” and the offender responded with racial slurs. The offender then approached the victim and threw coffee at the victim. There was no informa- tion in the case files indicating whether the offenders fall into any of the four categories, that is, thrill seeking, on a mission, defensive, or retaliatory. Rather, the precipitating event emerged as a direct result of the parking dispute. In another case, a Hispanic man arrived at the victim's yard sale intoxi- cated, loud, and boisterous. The accused stated, “I'll kick your mother f . . . ing cracker ass” and proceeded to kick and punch the victim. The accused then stated, “I kicked your ass white boy.” The victim reported that the responding officer refused to arrest the accused. The victim reported that the officer stated that the “fight was between two men” and that the “judge would throw the case out of court anyway.” The officer then gave the accused a ride away from the area. The victim called another officer to the scene. Though the verbal comments directed toward the victim were biased, there was no indication in the files whether the offender's goal was thrill seeking, retaliatory, mission, or defensive in nature. Subsequently, an inter- nal investigation was launched regarding the behavior of the initial responding officer. The case files revealed that the report filed by the initial responding officer made no mention of bias, but did mention the odor of alcohol and an argument about money. The final example of an unclassifiable case brings up an interesting issue concerning the prosecution of bias crimes: The victim of the alleged bias 899 crime was an on-duty police officer.6 The offender was involved in a motor vehicle accident and was subsequently arrested for driving under the influ- ence (DUI). The accused repeatedly threatened the transporting officers during transport. The offender made racial slurs and threatened to find out where the officer lived and to kill the officer's family. According to inves- tigative reports, the offender stated that he was “under the influence” at the time of the threats and that he “made a mistake.” The context of the case— the fact that the offender was in the custody of law enforcement at the time of the crime and made his remarks in response to his arrest—indicate that the offender was acting in response to the action of the officers rather than acting in a manner that can be classified as thrill seeking, mission, retalia- tory, or defensive. Discussion Due to the lack of empirical research on the prosecution of bias-motivated crimes, criminologists know very little about what kind of cases are success- fully prosecuted. This study focused on each of the cases prosecuted as a bias crime between 2001 and 2004 in one New Jersey county. As such, they were presumably cases in which both bias investigators and prosecutors believed were reasonably likely to result in a bias crime conviction. By examining cases that were actually prosecuted as bias crimes, rather than the larger pool of cases that potentially included an element of bias, this study aimed to exclude cases in which the bias element was most ambiguous. Although the cases were screened and identified as hate crimes, the cases did not easily fit the hate crime typology developed by Levin and McDevitt (1993). Generally, the cases designated as defensive, retaliatory, and mission were categorized with relative ease. However, the remaining one third of the cases was unclassifiable. Although the unclassifiable cases included some element of bias, this bias did not seem to be the primary motivation for the crime. The typology was developed to aid law enforcement in “investigating and identifying hate crimes”; arguably, the typology was designed to pro- vide an organized way of recognizing hate crimes (McDevitt, Levin, & Bennett, 2002, p. 305). The typology omits cases in which bias is a periph- eral component to the crime. It is recognized that if the typology were to be expanded to include such cases, it would ultimately water down the concept of a hate crime, rendering it virtually useless. Such an omission is consis- tent with Lawrence's (1999) suggestion that bias crime legislation should 900 target those offenders exhibiting racial animus rather than discriminatory selection, thereby excluding cases in which bias is peripheral to the motive. However, not all legislation is defined so narrowly. Case files revealed that, in this jurisdiction, there is still disagreement about whether bias need only be exhibited or be an integral element of the offense. Because such a large percentage of cases in the current study were unclassifiable, the typology did not appear to be a useful tool for categorizing cases in this jurisdiction. The typology may be most useful for law enforcement in those jurisdictions in which the law is defined rather narrowly. In the current study, cases in which bias seemed to be the primary, if not sole, motivation were most likely to end in a bias conviction. Similar to Martin's (1995) findings, determining the role of bias was sometimes prob- lematic. Even cases that displayed unambiguous, or included overwhelming, signs of bias such as painted swastikas or “KKKs,” frequently also included nonbias-related graffiti as well. For example, in one case, the offenders painted anti-Semitic graffiti along with the phrase, “I hate working here.” In such cases, the presence of nonbias graffiti may increase doubt among prosecutors (and jurors) that bias was the “true” motivation. Future research is needed in other jurisdictions to more fully understand the various types of cases prose- cuted as bias crimes. An additional concern regarding the application of the typology centers on cases categorized as mission, which involved evidence of mental illness, specifically psychotic symptoms, on the part of the offender. In general, the typology (as does the legal system) makes the assumption that offenders act rationally, with the exception of the mission category. Levin and McDevitt (1993, 2002, p. 91) proposed that the mission category includes those who tar- get an entire group of people, whether due to “severe mental illness,” includ- ing hallucinations and other psychotic symptoms, and/or allegiance to a hate group. A few cases in the current study involved offenders exhibiting paranoid delusions and other symptoms of psychosis. Conceptually categorizing the severely mentally ill along with (presumably otherwise rational) hate group members seems problematic. There is a qualitative difference between those who commit crimes as a result of mental illness and those whose crimes manifest as a consequence of their adoption of hateful ideology. As previously mentioned, a number of factors influence the way bias crime legislation is enforced across jurisdictions. The attitudes of law enforcement per- sonnel, training, bureaucratic organization, community context, and public sup- port may impact the extent to which policy is implemented (Haider-Markel, 2002; Jenness, 2007; Jenness & Grattet, 2005). Findings from the current study show that this particular jurisdiction has not only a detailed written 901 policy directed toward bias crimes but also has a dedicated team of full- time investigators assigned to enforcing the legislation. The investigators and prosecutors were enthusiastic, stating that their practices have fre- quently been praised as a desired model of bias crime law enforcement. However, despite the existence of a detailed policy and the effort exerted by law enforcers, ambiguities and difficulties enforcing bias crime legislation remain. Due to the variations in the enforcement of hate crime legislation, find- ings from this jurisdiction may not be generalized to other jurisdictions. Future studies should examine the application of the typology among a variety of jurisdictions, specifically those in which bias is defined as the sole, or the primary, motivation. Conclusion This research begs the question of at what point a typology is useful. Echoing Jacobs and Potter's (1998) concern regarding the very conception of a hate crime, must the typology provide for the vast majority of cases, only half, or only a fourth? A more optimistic take on the results may be that two thirds of the cases did indeed fit the typology. Furthermore, cases that fit the typology were more likely to result in at least one offender with a bias convic- tion than those that did not fit the typology. The findings suggest that the typol- ogy may be helpful only in identifying the most extreme examples of bias-motivated crimes. In this jurisdiction, the legal definition of a bias inci- dent considered suitable for prosecution is defined rather broadly. The net is cast even wider for the number of cases that have elements of bias motivation and undergo investigation. Hypothetically, if the concept of hate crime is widened to include the mere presence or expression of bias (or the typology is widened to more accurately include a substantial number of cases triggered by interpersonal confrontation), then a net-widening effect occurs. As a result, the distinguishing nature of bias crimes virtually vanishes. The net-widening effect also illustrates the concern regarding the unin- tended consequences of hate crime legislation (Franklin, 2002; Maroney, 1998). At its inception, hate crime legislation was focused on addressing vio- lence “connected to racism, nationalism, anti-Semitism, sexism, and hetero- sexism” (Jenness & Grattet, 2001, p. 32). Anti–hate crime advocates not only influenced policy designed to punish bias-motivated offenders as well as send a message to the larger community that bias-motivated crimes would not be tolerated (Jenness & Grattet, 2001). However, scholars were quick to voice 902 concerns about how the legislation would be enforced and who would be pun- ished (Franklin, 2002; Jacobs & Potter, 1998). Findings from the current study show that enforcement of the legislation applies to atypical offenders (e.g., mentally ill exhibiting psychotic symptoms) and atypical victims (e.g., on- duty police officers). Further research is needed to examine the types of cases prosecuted in other jurisdictions. Although much scholarly work has centered on various aspects of hate crimes, there is a paucity of research focused on cases actually prosecuted as hate crimes. Results indicate that the typology has limited usefulness in categorizing cases that are actually prosecuted as hate crimes in this juris- diction. A successful typology proves useful in a variety of empirical con- texts in which it is applied. Therefore, this research suggests at the outset that the everyday cases investigators and prosecutors encounter may be dif- ficult to classify into the widely cited and academically accepted hate crime typology. Rather than bias or hate, many cases appear to be primarily moti- vated by interpersonal confrontation between the parties who then use hate speech as a means of expressing anger or other emotion in an arguably impulsive manner. Future studies should examine the application of the typology among a variety of jurisdictions, specifically those in which bias is legally defined as the sole or primary motivation. Notes 1. The terms bias crime and hate crime will be used interchangeably. 2. Of the 30 cases referred for prosecution, the prosecutor's office was unable to locate files for 5 cases. Therefore, although descriptive information was available for all 30 cases, case outcome information was available for 25 cases. 3. McDevitt, Levin, and Bennett (2002) describe the hate crime typology as an “offender typology” (p. 303). In the current study, the unit of analysis is cases rather than offenders. The reason for this is that although each offender may have a different level of involvement within the same incident, the offenders shared the same bias motivation, and the case as a whole was categorized according to the typology. 4. Of the 25 cases for which case files were available, 23 (76.6%) resulted in at least one offender charged with bias intimidation, and 11 of these 23 cases resulted in at least one bias conviction. 5. Cases were classified as juvenile or adult based on whether the offender was juvenile or adult (18 years or older) at the time of the crime. Cases with more than one offender were coded according to the age of the majority of offenders. In cases in which there was a combination of juvenile and adult offenders, the age gap was generally not greater than 1 year. 6. The issue is, are police officers, while on duty, eligible to be victims of bias? Bias unit investigators repeatedly informed me that police officers cannot be victims of a bias crime while on duty, however, the case was prosecuted as a bias crime. Case notes revealed this exception: “It appears that the accused, though he had been drinking, went beyond the officer's uniform to attack him and his family personally by making threats that could be carried out as the accused knows where the victims live . . . .” 903 References American Prosecutors Research Institute.

Nearly 15,900 law enforcement agencies reported a total of 7,314 incidents of bias- or prejudice-motivated crime in 2019 -- up from 7,120 in 2018 -- and 8,559 related offenses. As in past years, race was the primary motivation, followed by religion and sexual orientation. 
[READ:California Firearm Purchases, Concerns of Violence Are Up During Pandemic]
The number of hate crimes -- criminal offenses motivated by bias against the victim's race/ethnicity/ancestry, gender, gender identity, religion, disability or sexual orientation, according to the FBI -- varied by state, with California reporting the highest number: 1,221 bias-motivated crimes. More than 800 of those were categorized as crimes against people. The rest were against property, with 330 crimes categorized as vandalism. 
Following the Golden State with the most hate crimes were New York (618), New Jersey (478), Washington (664) and Texas (560). Texas was home to more than half of the hate-crime murders reported in 2019; 22 people were killed in El Paso during a race-motivated shooting in August -- the most lethal hate crime attack recorded by the FBI, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University--San Bernardino. 
Alabama reported zero hate crimes in 2019. Wyoming (6), Arkansas (10), Iowa (13), Mississippi (15) and Maryland (18) reported the next fewest. 
One factor impacting the state-by-state reporting is the number of agencies participating in this data collection. Law enforcement agencies vary in number, based on state population, and they aren't required to report hate crime statistics to the FBI. In Hawaii, for example, just one agency reported hate crime incidents to the FBI. That state agency covers approximately 975,000 people, according to the FBI; the state's population is 1.43 million. Meanwhile, California had 737 participating agencies covering its 39.5 million residents. 
Other findings from the FBI report: 
-- Of the 1,715 victims of anti-religious hate crimes, anti-Jewish bias led to the crimes that impacted 60.2% of the victims.
-- For single-bias hate crimes, 57.6% of victims were targeted because of their race/ethnicity/ancestry, 20.1% were targeted because of their religion and 16.7% were targeted because of their sexual orientation.
-- There were 4,930 victims of race/ethnicity/ancestry motivated hate crime among single-bias hate crime incidents in 2019, and 48.5% were victims of crimes driven by offenders' anti-Black or anti-African American bias.

10,/content/Bias_Crime_Lexis_1.DOCX,Impact News Service,2020-11-18,480 words,,,,New FBI Hate Crimes Report Shows Increases in Anti-LGBTQ Attacks,False,"New York: The Human Rights Campaign has issued the following press release:
HRC responded to troubling federal data showing unacceptably high levels of hate crimes — and an increase in those targeting LGBTQ people — as disclosed by the FBI today.
Today’s report shows that hate crimes based on sexual orientation represent 16.8% of hate crimes, the third largest category after race and religion. The report also shows an uptick in gender identity based hate crimes rising from 2.2% in 2018 to 2.7% in 2019.
“Yet another year with alarming levels of bias-motivated crimes underscores just how urgent it is to address this hate crimes epidemic. This year, we saw a tragic new record of fatal violence against transgender and gender non-conforming people in this country, particularly against Black and Brown transgender women. These alarming statistics represent real trauma for individuals and families across this country who have to bear the brunt of these hate crimes. As the Biden-Harris administration assumes office, we must recommit ourselves to advocating for mandatory hate crimes reporting across the country, better training for law enforcement officers to recognize bias-motivated crimes, and greater inclusion and equity in our communities. ”
Alphonso David, Human Rights Campaign President
Because reporting hate crimes to the FBI is not mandatory, these alarming statistics likely represent only a fraction of such violence. The number of law enforcement agencies reporting hate crimes data decreased by 451 from 2018 to 2019. 71 cities with populations exceeding 100,000 either did not report data to the FBI or affirmatively reported zero hate crimes which is clearly not credible. The lack of mandatory reporting means that the FBI data, while helpful, paints an incomplete picture of hate crimes against the LGBTQ and other communities.
That is why since the passage of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act (HCPA) in 2009, HRC has worked with the FBI to update the agency’s crime reporting, from providing training materials to sharing details on hate crimes when they occur. HRC continues to press for improved reporting, passage of state laws that protect LGBTQ individuals from hate crimes and expanded education and training initiatives.
It’s not only LGBTQ people who are affected by this epidemic of violence. Bias-motivated crimes based on race, religion, disability and gender remain at troublingly high levels. Racially-motivated crime remains the most common hate crime, with nearly half of race-based hate crimes targeting Black people. For the fourth year in a row, there was a significant uptick in hate crimes targeting the Latinx community, increasing 9% from last year. Crimes involving religion-based bias increased with crimes targeting Jewish people and Jewish institutions rising 14% and anti-Muslim hate crimes rising 16%.",Bias Crime
11,/content/Bias_Crime_Lexis_1.DOCX,"Spokesman Review (Spokane, WA)",2020-11-21,1214 words,A; Pg. 008,Lewis Kamb Seattle Times,,"Washington's increasing hate crime numbers in latest report tell only part of the story, experts say",False,"SEATTLE - It seems counterintuitive, but some law enforcement experts in Washington can see progress in the escalating numbers of reported hate crimes statewide, in the wake of the FBI's latest annual report released this week showing that the criminal offenses motivated by bias have reached record levels nationwide.
Washington's reported number of hate crimes rose from 506 reported in 2018 to 542 last year - the latest uptick in what's been a rising trend documented in recent years in the FBI's Uniform Crime Report, the agency's annual compilation of crime statistics reported by local law enforcement departments nationwide.
With its 7% increase, Washington - which typically rates among the states with the most reported bias crimes - climbed one rung higher into third place in the national rankings for the undesirable category, trailing only California, with 1,015 reported offenses, and New York, with 611.
Washington has such a high ranking in part because people here are comparatively more likely to report the hate crimes that happen to them, experts said - and while higher rates of reporting are a good thing, they also highlight the sheer volume of hate crimes that are committed in Washington and nationwide.
""I think Washington state does a remarkably good job of reporting these incidents because we have an active citizenry that pays more attention to them,"" said Monisha Harrell, chair of Equal Rights Washington, a statewide advocacy group for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer residents.
""But where Washington is absolutely no exception is the crimes we're seeing here,"" Harrell added. ""Our top (bias) crimes are against Black people, then it's religion and LGBTQ. That matches trends across the nation and tells me that clearly, like everywhere else, we've got work to do.""
The rising number of reports reflected in the FBI's stats underscore what anti-bias advocates say they're routinely experiencing these days.
""We get reports almost daily from the public about incidents of violence or hate,"" said Kendall Kosai, interim regional director of the Anti-Defamation League, Pacific Northwest. ""We are pretty much busier than we've ever been before.""
While useful in some ways, the FBI's bias crime data varies wildly from state to state, largely depending on different levels of participation and assorted reporting methods by local police agencies. In turn, the annual report provides an apples-to-oranges comparison, at best.
""We have to take those (statistics) with a grain of salt,"" said FBI Supervisory Special Agent Ryan Bruett, statewide program coordinator for Hate Crimes and Civil Rights in Washington. ""It's difficult to draw too many conclusions from the data.""
Case in point: Fourteen states reported 20 or fewer hate crimes for all of last year, with Mississippi reporting just five offenses and Alabama failing to record a single one. The number of local police agencies submitting hate crime reports to the FBI last year also ranged from none in Alabama to 208 in New Jersey, illustrating the spottiness in local participation that the FBI relies upon to compile the statistics.
So, in that sense, the number of reported hate crimes in Washington ""can be seen as a positive,"" Bruett said, because ""it shows that, here in Washington, there's more reporting of these kinds of incidents.""
""And that's a good thing,"" he added. ""Much like sexual assault cases, one of our long-running concerns is that hate crimes are under-reported.""
Even in Washington, underreporting of hate crimes remains a problem, said Kosai, the regional ADL director. Several major cities, including Kirkland, Lakewood, Edmonds and Pasco failed to report a single hate crime to the FBI, he noted.
Another factor that can skew the FBI stats is the variety, or total lacking, of state laws defining what constitutes a hate crime. While a set of federal acts that generally outlaw threatening or injuring someone else based on race, color, religion, sexual orientation and other grounds could apply to crimes committed in any state, just 32 states had their own bias crime statutes as recently as five years ago. Today, all but three states have hate crime laws, though they vary significantly from one state to another.
Washington's malicious harassment law specifies eight categories for bias, including race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, gender, sexual orientation and mental, physical or sensory disability. Seattle also has its own hate crime law that includes five additional categories: homelessness, marital status, political ideology, age and parental status.
Beyond using the annual FBI numbers to compare Washington to other states or to its past, experts say the rising numbers here generally tell a story of progress in outreach work. The typical targets of hate crimes - racial, ethnic and religious minorities, immigrants and LGBTQ people - are communities traditionally reluctant to report crimes to police, they said.
""We really want and need people to come forward to report these kinds of crimes,"" said Seattle Police Det. Elizabeth Wareing, the only full-time bias crimes coordinator assigned to a police agency in Washington. ""So if we're building trust with the people who are being victimized, we're going to see higher numbers. We're just going to have to accept that, and Seattle is a perfect example.""
Most of Washington's reported hate crime comes through the Seattle Police Department. Unlike most local police agencies in this state or nationwide, Seattle not only tracks offenses motivated by bias but also records crimes that are committed for other reasons but also include an element of bias, as well as ""noncriminal bias incidents.""
The latter two categories might include a robbery suspect who commits a crime for financial motivations but shouts a racial slur at a security guard who chases him down; and a passing motorist who yells ""go back to your country"" to a pedestrian wearing a hijab.
While neither incident would show up as a hate crime in the FBI's annual report, documenting them helps demonstrate to targeted communities that police take these matters seriously, which in turn builds trust and increases overall reporting, Wareing said.
""Most agencies see the very tip of the iceberg on these incidents,"" she said. ""We see a little bit more than that.""
Seattle's reporting approach, updated and posted regularly on the department's website, also provides a more nuanced perspective than the FBI statistics, Wareing said. In 2020 - just as it has every year since 2015, the year Wareing took on the bias crime coordinator's role - reported hate crimes have increased. But perhaps more telling is a spike in general reports of incivility and use of inflammatory language, Wareing said.
""These aren't necessarily even someone committing a crime, just saying something that's hurtful,"" she said. ""People are reporting it more and more and our officers are doing a good job of capturing it. And that's important for people to feel heard.""
While people sometimes equate the term ""hate crime"" with overt acts of terrorism by white supremacist groups or other extremists, the reports that local agencies are fielding and passing along to the FBI typically are committed by someone who lives or works near you, Wareing and Bruett said.",Bias Crime

13,/content/Bias_Crime_Lexis_1.DOCX,The New York Times,2020-11-17,732 words,Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 19,By Tim Arango,,"Hate Crimes At Highest Since 2008, F.B.I. Reports",False,"An F.B.I. report on hate crimes also found that more murders motivated by hate were recorded in 2019 than in any year before.
Hate crimes in the United States rose to their highest level in more than a decade last year, while more murders motivated by hate were recorded than ever before, the F.B.I. said on Monday. 
 The sharp rise in homicides driven by hatred -- there were 51 last year, according to the F.B.I. -- was attributed in large part to the mass shooting in El Paso in August 2019. In that shooting, the authorities say a 21-year-old gunman motivated by hatred toward Latinos stormed a Walmart and killed 23 people and injured many more.
 The death toll in the El Paso attack more than doubled that of 2018's deadliest hate-motivated crime, the mass shooting targeting Jews at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.
 Over all, the F.B.I. collected data on 7,314 criminal incidents motivated by bias toward race or ethnicity or gender identity in 2019. It was the third straight year the metric surpassed 7,100 incidents and it was the highest number since the F.B.I. reported 7,783 incidents in 2008. Experts say the F.B.I. data likely undercounts the number of hate crimes in America, both because many victims fail to report incidents and local agencies are not required to report hate crime data to the F.B.I.
 For example, last year only 2,172 agencies reported hate crime data to the F.B.I., out of a total of more than 15,000 law enforcement agencies around the country, according to the F.B.I.'s report. (Notable omissions from the data in recent years have included the death of a protester in 2017 during a rally of white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va.)
 ''It's important to note that, because of the nature of hate crime reporting, the F.B.I.'s annual report vastly understates the real level of hate crimes in the country,'' the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups, said on Monday.
 The S.P.L.C. noted that the rise in hate crimes in recent years has come as the number of white supremacy groups has surged. According to data collected by the S.P.L.C., the number of white nationalist groups grew 55 percent between 2017 and 2019.
 The upswing in hate crimes last year underscored the upward trend in bias-motivated crimes during the Trump era, and the harsh rhetoric against Latino immigrants was seen as motivating the gunman in the El Paso shooting.
 ''Politics plays a role,'' said Brian Levin, a professor at California State University, San Bernardino, and the director of the university's Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism.
 ''The president's rhetoric has been identified in a series of actual attacks,'' Mr. Levin added, ''but moreover the day-by-day ticks of F.B.I. hate crimes shows there are increases after sustained and fervent remarks by the president that enter into an online feedback loop that also ends up in other discourses, both at the water cooler and on television.''
 The overall increase was fueled by a rise in attacks, in particular, against Hispanics and Jews. The F.B.I. reported 953 anti-Semitic hate crimes last year, a 14 percent increase from the previous year and the most since 2008, according to a report by California State University, San Bernardino, that analyzed the latest F.B.I. report and was published on Monday.
 Hate crimes directed at Latinos rose almost 9 percent, to 527 incidents last year from 485 incidents in 2018. At the same time, hate crimes against Black people fell to the lowest portion of all hate crimes since such data started to be collected by the F.B.I., although Black people were still far overrepresented in the statistics, according to Mr. Levin's report. Last year, hate crimes targeting Black people fell slightly, by less than 1 percent.
 ''Blacks are still the No. 1 target, at twice the level they represent in the American population,'' the report said.
 In examining preliminary data from 2020, Mr. Levin found overall declines in hate crimes, which he explained as a result of social distancing measures and business closures from the coronavirus pandemic, except in three cities: Los Angeles, Houston and San Antonio. He has also found increases in bias crimes this year against two groups in particular, transgender people and Asian-Americans; the latter, he said, was most likely affected by anti-Asian animus provoked by false claims about the pandemic.

ECOSOC Advisor
U.S. Mission to the United Nations
New York, New York
Thank you, Independent Expert Madrigal. Let me begin with a question: What strategies can countries implement to improve data collection on violence directed against LGBTI persons without doing harm?
We appreciate this opportunity to highlight the continued need to combat violence and discrimination against LGBTI persons globally. Protecting and defending the human rights of all people has long been and remains at the heart of American foreign policy. The United States proudly advances efforts to protect LGBTI populations from violence, criminalization, discrimination, and stigma.
Around the world, LGBTI persons are subjected to violence and bias-motivated crime. The United States stands against all forms of violence, including human rights violations and abuses against people on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity. All governments should uphold their commitment to protect and respect every person's fundamental freedoms, and no government should support or encourage violence or hostility directed at LGBTI persons under any circumstances.
Continued barriers to accurate reporting of violence, harassment, and discrimination- something exacerbated by laws criminalizing LGBTI status or conduct- is deeply concerning. The negative impact of such laws can be heightened by COVID-19 pandemic-related emergency restrictions on certain fundamental freedoms. LGBTI persons have reported increased human rights abuses and restrictions on their freedom of association and their right to peaceful assembly during this time.
Comprehensive and accurate data collection is essential to formulating policy and to holding officials and others accountable for behavior inconsistent with the equal rights of LGBTI persons. We are concerned that such data remains lacking both in many national contexts and in some UN reporting. Especially in light of current global challenges that increase the vulnerability of LGBTI persons to violence and discrimination, the United States will continue to mobilize resources to protect the human rights of LGBTI persons. Better data will further this effort.

The death toll in the El Paso attack more than doubled that of 2018’s deadliest hate-motivated crime, the mass shooting targeting Jews at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.
Over all, the F.B.I. collected data on 7,314 criminal incidents motivated by bias toward race or ethnicity or gender identity in 2019. It was the third straight year the metric surpassed 7,100 incidents and it was the highest number since the F.B.I. reported 7,783 incidents in 2008. Experts say the F.B.I. data likely undercounts the number of hate crimes in America, both because many victims fail to report incidents and local agencies are not required to report hate crime data to the F.B.I.
For example, last year only 2,172 agencies reported hate crime data to the F.B.I., out of a total of more than 15,000 law enforcement agencies around the country, according to the F.B.I.’s report. (Notable omissions from the data in recent years have included the death of a protester in 2017 during a rally of white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va.)
“It’s important to note that, because of the nature of hate crime reporting, the F.B.I.’s annual report vastly understates the real level of hate crimes in the country,” the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups, said on Monday.
The S.P.L.C. noted that the rise in hate crimes in recent years has come as the number of white supremacy groups has surged. According to data collected by the S.P.L.C., the number of white nationalist groups grew 55 percent between 2017 and 2019.
The upswing in hate crimes last year underscored the upward trend in bias-motivated crimes during the Trump era, and the harsh rhetoric against Latino immigrants was seen as motivating the gunman in the El Paso shooting.
“Politics plays a role,” said Brian Levin, a professor at California State University, San Bernardino, and the director of the university’s Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism.
“The president’s rhetoric has been identified in a series of actual attacks,” Mr. Levin added, “but moreover the day-by-day ticks of F.B.I. hate crimes shows there are increases after sustained and fervent remarks by the president that enter into an online feedback loop that also ends up in other discourses, both at the water cooler and on television.”
The overall increase was fueled by a rise in attacks, in particular, against Hispanics and Jews. The F.B.I. reported 953 anti-Semitic hate crimes last year, a 14 percent increase from the previous year and the most since 2008, according to a report by California State University, San Bernardino, that analyzed the latest F.B.I. report and was published on Monday.
Hate crimes directed at Latinos rose almost 9 percent, to 527 incidents last year from 485 incidents in 2018. At the same time, hate crimes against Black people fell to the lowest portion of all hate crimes since such data started to be collected by the F.B.I., although Black people were still far overrepresented in the statistics, according to Mr. Levin’s report. Last year, hate crimes targeting Black people fell slightly, by less than 1 percent.
“Blacks are still the No. 1 target, at twice the level they represent in the American population,” the report said.
In examining preliminary data from 2020, Mr. Levin found overall declines in hate crimes, which he explained as a result of social distancing measures and business closures from the coronavirus pandemic, except in three cities: Los Angeles, Houston and San Antonio. He has also found increases in bias crimes this year against two groups in particular, transgender people and Asian-Americans; the latter, he said, was most likely affected by anti-Asian animus provoked by false claims about the pandemic.

Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday he was ""outraged"" by a violent assault on a 30-year-old transgender man in Rochester and was ordering the State Police Hate Crimes Task Force to aid in the investigation.
Samson Tequir, a local Black Lives Matter organizer, sustained a broken eye socket and multiple facial fractures in the attack last Friday, which he said may have been partially live streamed on social media.
Tequir was attacked around noon as he and his partner walked home from a corner store. Police released surveillance video showing two suspects, but no arrests have been made. The assailants made anti-gay remarks, he said.
“My story is not new,"" Tequir told the Democrat and Chronicle, citing a rise in gender-identity bias crimes. “It is not the last one, and I can look around the room I am in right now and find more of those stories just the same.”
Tequir faulted a slow police response for allowing the assailants to get away.
There was a 36-minute lag between the time a 911 call was placed and when officers were dispatched, which the police department said was because they were tied up on other jobs. It took another eight minutes for officers to arrive.
Rochester Police Chief La'Ron Singletary said in a statement Wednesday that the department was “utilizing every resource to investigate and apprehend the person(s) responsible for this heinous crime committed in our community.” He added that the police department has no tolerance for any crimes, “let alone a crime that is committed because of an individual's identity.”
Cuomo said in a statement that the state police task force will provide “any and all resources necessary to bring the assailants to justice.”
“I am outraged by reports of an assault against a 30-year-old black transgender man in Rochester,"" Cuomo said. “New York will never tolerate such rancorous acts of hate.”",Bias Crime

Graffiti included a swastika, the drawing of a penis, the words 'Jews' and 'n-----'
The mayor has condemned the vandalism as 'disturbing' and 'a hate crime'
Antisemitic and racist graffiti scrawled on the street in a town in northern New Jersey over Halloween as been condemned as 'disturbing' and 'a hate crime'. 
The graffiti was found in Woodcliff Lake, in the Woodmont neighbourhood, on the morning of October 31. 
The mayor of Woodcliff Lake shared the photographs of the graffiti scrawled in white chalk on Woodmont Drive which included a swastika, the drawing of a penis, and the words 'Jews' and 'n-----'.
Woodcliff Lake Mayor Carols A. Rendo said: 'These images are disturbing and criminal. It is vandalism and a hate crime. 
'The perpetrators will be dealt with to the fullest extent of the law. Any resident with information on this please contact our police department. 
The crime happened on Mischief Night, an informal holiday on the night before Halloween, when children and teenagers are emboldened to engage in pranks and vandalism. 
The extent of their pranks usually range from dangling toilet paper and silly string from trees, and throwing soap or eggs on parked cars. 
The Mayor Carols A. Rendo told the New York Post: 'A resident text me early in the morning and I was quite disturbed and upset by it.' 
He said he expects that the perpetrators are 'ignorant kids who thought it was funny.'
According to the Post, there are a significant number of Jewish Americans living in Woodcliff Lake.
Mercy Gaete commented on the mayor's post on Facebook, writing: 'Absolutely disgraceful. It does not matter how old these ""kids"" are. This is learned behavior. 
'This is a hate crime and they should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.' 
A police investigation into the 'hate speech' incident is underway. 
The Woodcliff Lake police department tweeted: 'The WCLPD is investigating a bias incident regarding hate speech and symbols displayed in the area of Woodmont Drive. 
'Residents with info are encouraged to contact police HQ at 201-391-8222. We are taking this matter very seriously as this conduct is unacceptable in our community.' 
Bias crimes in New Jersey are on the rise. Last year, the state of New Jersey logged 994 bias incidents, almost a 75% increase from the year before.
It is the most largest year-to-year increase since New Jersey began tracking incidents and the state's highest total. ",Bias Crime
20,/content/Bias_Crime_Lexis_1.DOCX,The New York Times,2020-10-22,1583 words,NYREGION,John Leland,,He Was a Rising Jazz Pianist. Then His N.Y.C. Dreams Were Shattered.,False,"The police said an attack on the pianist was not a hate crime, but social media disagreed. Now he’s considering a return to Japan.
He came to New York from Tokyo to make it as a jazz musician, and he did, landing gigs in several touring bands and leading a trio of his own. He was elegant but never flashy on the piano, always well prepared and on time.
It was not an easy path. On Sept. 27, at around 7:20 in the evening, that path got a lot harder.
Coming off the subway at West 135th Street after a video shoot, Tadataka Unno, 40, a new father, encountered a group of about eight young people who blocked his way to the turnstiles. When he tried to pass through, one of them shoved him from behind. Another said he had pushed her, and a young man near her said, “My girl is pregnant.”
That’s when the beating started — first in the subway station and then up on the street, where he yelled for people to help him, to no avail.
“I thought that this was how I was going to die,” he recalled two weeks later, describing the attack in a written note because it was still painful to talk about it. He did not know how many in the group had hit him. They fractured his right collarbone, injured his arm and bruised him all over. After surgery for the broken bones, he was not sure whether he will ever be able to play the piano again. He has been unable to use his right hand at all, and said he is learning to do everything with his left hand.
The police have made no arrests, though Mr. Unno said the assault was captured on camera in the subway station. He remembered at least one of the attackers calling him “Asian” and “Chinese,” along with a profanity.
‘I needed to know the culture.’
How quickly does a life change course?
Tadataka Unno was fated to arrive in New York. He started playing jazz piano at age 9, and playing professionally in Japan at 18. The work was steady and gratifying, with recording opportunities and gigs almost every night. But, after a decade, he felt there was something missing, he said in a telephone interview. He could listen to records in Japan, but jazz was more than recordings. “I needed to know the culture,” he said.
In 2008, when he was 27, his mother cried when he said he was moving to New York, told him not to go. She thought New York was dangerous.
“I wanted to meet my heroes, to play with them, to talk, to hang out,” he said. “If I stay in Japan it’ll never happen.”
He and his wife, Sayaka, arrived in Harlem on June 19, 2008. Harlem was where jazz history lived. “I didn’t know anybody,” he said. “I didn’t have any job. But I didn’t worry about it. I was just happy to be in New York.”
New York breaks those dreams more often than not. But Mr. Unno made them work.
“He’s one of the workman jazz piano players on the New York scene,” said Spike Wilner, a pianist who owns and runs Smalls and Mezzrow, two clubs downtown. “He works hard, practices hard, but he’s not necessarily high profile. But he’s a tasty pianist, elegant. And a sweetheart of a guy, very gentle. He calls me Spike-san, and I call him Tada-san. Everybody loves him.”
He got work playing with Jimmy Cobb, who played drums on Miles Davis’s album “Kind of Blue,” which is like being second from the end at Mount Rushmore. This led to a two-year stint with the trumpeter Roy Hargrove, a phenom closer to Mr. Unno’s generation.
“That was a historical moment, because Roy never hired an Asian guy before me,” Mr. Unno said with obvious pride. Mr. Hargrove died of cardiac arrest brought on by kidney disease two years ago, at age 49. Mr. Unno was his last regular pianist. “He gave me so much love and culture, history,” Mr. Unno said. “I feel I have a responsibility for what I learned from him. I need to make it my own way, through my music.”
Mr. Unno was always keenly aware of the racial dynamic of jazz, that he was working in a music genre developed by African-Americans, said his friend Jerome Jennings, a drummer and jazz educator who met him back in Japan.
“He was always asking questions to get a better understanding of the culture,” Mr. Jennings said. “There’s a song lyric, ‘You can keep your Dixie/Drop me off in Harlem.’ Tada asked me, ‘What does Dixie mean?’ He was totally open to ingesting the culture and understanding it by any means. He just soaked it up. Living in Harlem was part of that. He understood it was where all those great musicians lived. He knew the importance.”
By 2020, most of what he had envisioned when he left Tokyo for New York had come his way. He had peers, recognition and music. In June he and his wife had their first child, a son.
“He was so happy,” Mr. Wilner said. “Of course, it puts a lot of pressure on him to keep working, keep things coming in. But he’s very excited.”
The racial epithet
As the attack went on, Mr. Unno said he was saved by a woman who called for an ambulance, which took him to Harlem Hospital Center. He was in shock from the beating and from the unwillingness of bystanders to step in. Nothing like this had ever happened to him before. He could not move his arm, and would have to return for surgery. At home, he said, he felt like his wife had “two babies to take care of.”
On Oct. 3, Mr. Jennings created a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for medical bills and other expenses. Since the start of the pandemic in March, Mr. Unno, like other musicians, had been unable to earn money by performing. Now his downtime was indefinite, with a baby at home and bills piling up.
The GoFundMe campaign, which made no mention of any racial remarks made by the attackers, surpassed its modest goal of $25,000 on the first day. The money kept coming in, with posts on social media spreading the word and wishing Mr. Unno a full recovery.
Then on Oct. 6, the Japanese news outlet Asahi Shimbun quoted Mr. Unno saying that one of the attackers had used the word “Chinese” during the attack. Other outlets in Asia and the United States picked up the story, emphasizing the slur. “Japanese Musician Beaten Up in New York for Being ‘Chinese,’” ran the headline in Japan Today. Many noted that crimes against Asian-Americans have risen since the start of the pandemic, which Donald Trump has repeatedly blamed on China.
The tenor of social media posts changed. Now it was a story about racism, about “white thugs” inspired by Mr. Trump in one post, or, in a Twitter post soon after, about “racist blacks in Harlem” who “get away with racial slurs and violence.”
As a window on racial violence rather than a random assault, social media posts spread beyond jazz circles. Grace Meng, a congresswoman representing part of Queens, wrote that “Hate — against AAPIs and against any community — has no place in New York,” using the abbreviation for Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders. Any uncertainty about the attackers’ motives seemed to evaporate.
Mr. Unno received an outpouring of messages from Japanese Americans who recounted their own experiences with racism. He was astonished by their number. As he read the messages, he said, “My pain was their pain.”
But the motives behind a seemingly senseless crime can be hard to know with certainty.
The police have found no indication that the group attacked Mr. Unno because of his race, and have not classified the attack as a bias crime. Mr. Unno said the attack was a “blur,” but that he was sure he had heard the slur. There was no evidence that Mr. Trump’s influence had a role in the attack.
An officer from the police department’s Asian Hate Crime Task Force, which formed in August because of the rise in violence, interviewed Mr. Unno but did not consider the attack to be motivated by race.
Mr. Jennings cautioned against calling it a hate crime without more evidence. The attackers, he said, were young people in a time of heightened stress and anger. “I think some of the papers are spinning a bit,” he said.
The GoFundMe campaign recently passed $165,000.
Mr. Unno said he still needed “very strong painkillers” to get through the day. He is unable to play piano or hold his son, and does not know how much function he will regain. Even as he worries about his physical recovery, he fears that recovering from the emotional trauma may be even more difficult. Since the attack he has not left the apartment except for medical treatments because he is afraid. He does not think he could recognize the attackers, because he lost his glasses with the first blows.
Until the attack, he had never experienced racism in New York, he said, and it shook him. He had come to the city to mix with people not like him, and now he was suffering for this difference.
He said he was considering leaving the city that once drew him like the sun, possibly returning to Japan. “My wife and I worry about raising kids here, especially after this happened,” he said.
The messages from other Asian-Americans talking about their own ordeals, he said, brought home that “there isn’t a major movement like Black Lives Matter that creates a space for Asians to talk about these issues.”
That needed to change, he said. “The Asian community is not so tight. Asian people need to stand up and take action.”

State Coalition Against Domestic Violence Issues Public Comment on HUD Proposed Rule,False,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 22 -- Connie Neal, executive director of the New York State Coalition Against Domestic Violence, Albany, has issued a public comment on the Department of Housing and Urban Development proposed rule entitled ""Making Admission or Placement Determinations Based on Sex in Facilities Under Community Planning and Development Housing Programs"". The comment was written on Sept. 21, 2020, and posted on Oct. 21, 2020:
* * *
I am writing on behalf of the New York State Coalition Against Domestic Violence's (NYSCADV) response to the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) proposed rule change published in the Federal Register on July 24, 2020 (RIN 2506-AC53; HUD Docket No. FR-6152-P-01) entitled, ""Making Admission or Placement Determinations Based on Sex in Facilities Under Community Planning and Development Housing Programs."" We urge that this proposed rule change be withdrawn in its entirety.
NYSCADV was established 40 years ago as a statewide non-profit membership organization comprised of local domestic violence service providers and allied organizations that are committed to preventing and ending domestic violence. NYSCADV is designated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as the information clearinghouse, primary point of contact and resource center on domestic violence for the State of New York. NYSCADV is responsible for supporting the development of policies, protocols and procedures to enhance domestic violence intervention and prevention and also provides education and technical assistance to the network of primary-purpose domestic violence service providers statewide.
Since our inception, a primary focus of our work supports New York's local domestic violence service providers in the provision of trauma-informed, survivor-centered domestic violence services. NYSCADV has been engaged in a multi-year comprehensive umbrella project that supports local domestic violence service providers in their ongoing efforts to ensure that the services they provide meet the unique needs of all individuals and families who have been victimized by an abuser. This certainly includes efforts to ensure the accessibility of services to transgender individuals, a majority of whom experience some form of domestic violence during their lifetime. In fact, according to the 2015 National Transgender Discrimination Survey, more than half (54%) of respondents reported some form of intimate partner violence, and 47% had been sexually assaulted at some point in their lifetime./1
Federal and state government agencies and elected officials should be working in partnership with domestic violence advocacy organizations, victim services organizations, domestic violence survivors, transgender advocates, and other stakeholders to enhance the accessibility and availability of services for the transgender community, not restricting access and making it harder for transgender individuals to seek help. But HUD's proposal to amend the Equal Access Rule does the exact opposite. It seeks to roll back life-saving protections for transgender people seeking shelter. The New York State Coalition Against Domestic Violence and our member programs across New York State oppose any discriminatory barriers to services for transgender individuals and others.
New York State has taken great strides in protecting transgender individuals and others from all forms of discrimination. In October 2015, New York State became the first state in the nation to issue statewide regulations prohibiting harassment and discrimination on the basis of gender identity, transgender status or gender dysphoria. The regulations affirm that transgender individuals are protected under the State's Human Rights Law. As such, discrimination against transgender persons in New York State by housing providers, businesses, creditors and others is unlawful. Further, in 2019, Governor Andrew Cuomo signed into law the Gender Expression Non-Discrimination Act (GENDA) which added gender identity and gender expression to the state's human rights and hate crimes laws as protected classes, bans discrimination in employment, housing and public accommodations based on gender identity and gender expression, and provides enhanced penalties for bias-motivated crimes.
NYSCADV will continue advocating for the rights of transgender individuals in New York State and beyond. To that end, these comments reflect our commitment to ensuring that every survivor has access to shelter during a time of crisis, and from the deep knowledge from decades of experience that perpetuating discriminatory policies against any group or identity does not increase safety in shelter programs.
We urge the withdrawal of the rule.
Sincerely,
Connie Neal
Executive Director

23,/content/Bias_Crime_Lexis_1.DOCX,UPI,2020-11-16,655 words,,DARRYL COOTE,,FBI: Hate crime murders surged to record high in 2019,False,"Killings classified as hate crimes skyrocketed by more than 100% to a record high last year as all forms of hate crime continue to rise throughout the country, according to data released Monday by the FBI.
The FBI data shows there were 51 murders last year that were reported as hate crimes, up 113% percent from the 24 in 2018 and the most since the bureau started compiling such data after Congress passed the Hate Crimes Statistics Act in 1990.
Last year was also the fourth consecutive increase in hate crime murders, according to the FBI data.
In total, there were 7,314 reported hate crime incidents in 2019, an increase of some 200 such incidents from 2018. Last year also represented the fifth increase in six years.
A hate crime is defined as a criminal offense that is motivated by the offender's bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender or gender identity. Some crimes are motivated by more than one bias, the FBI said.
""When one individual is targeted by a hate crime, it hurts the whole community -- that's why people are feeling vulnerable and afraid,"" Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement on the statistics' release.
Among the 8,552 victims of hate crimes last year, the majority at 57.6% were targeted because of race, ethnicity or ancestry followed by 20.1% because of religion, 16.7% because of sexual orientation, 2.7% because of gender identity, 2% because of disability and 0.9% because of gender.
Hate crimes targeting Jewish and Hispanic people rose 14% and 9%, respectively, with hate crimes targeting people based on their gender identity rising 18% last year after surging 41% a year earlier.
The Southern Poverty Law Center, a non-profit civil rights legal advocacy organization, said in a statement that the increases in hate crimes reflect ""a growing threat of violence from the extreme right.""
Of the 51 hate crime murders committed last year, some two dozen were attributed to attacks that were planned to incite further violence, such as the El Paso Walmart shooting that killed 23 people, the center said.
""These racist ideas are not a political anomaly but rather the most extreme outgrowth of a White supremacist political culture,"" the center said. ""That racism, anti-Hispanic sentiment, antisemitism and homophobia remain pressing problems in the U.S. is reflected in the 2019 hate crime increases.""
The data also shows surging hate crime incidents despite the 15,588 law enforcement agencies that voluntarily submitted their data represent a significant drop from the 16,039 agencies that participated in 2018 and the 16,149 in 2017.
The New York-based ADL, a Jewish non-profit organization that fights all forms of hate, described the FBI's annual report as providing ""the most comprehensive snapshot"" of bias-motivated crimes but the lack of agencies reporting under tabulates the true number of such crimes being committed.
""The total severity of the impact and damage caused by hate crimes cannot be fully measured without complete participation in the FBI's data collection process,"" Greenblatt said, calling on Congress and law enforcement agencies to improve data collection and reporting of hate crimes.
Greenblatt said 2019's increase may be the product of improved reporting but that local law enforcement agencies across the country still need to improve training in order to remove barriers that prevent victims of hate crimes from coming forward.
""In this pivotal moment in our national conversation about the importance of justice for communities of color, religious minorities and the LGBTQ+ community, we must make combating hate crimes a top priority,"" he said.
The Southern Poverty Law Center mirrored this call, urging the Biden administration to mandate the federal collection of hate crime data and move funding to the Department of Education aimed at preventing extremism and to build a curriculum on structural racism.",Bias Crime

* * *
Today, co-chairs of the Jewish Latino Congressional Caucus, Reps. Adriano Espaillat (NY-13), Eliot Engel (NY-16), Debbie Wasserman Schultz (FL-23), Will Hurd (TX-23), and Mario Diaz Balart (FL-25) released the following statement in support of the No Hate Act:
Key excerpts from the joint statement:
""Hate crimes do not just affect victims. Because the victim is targeted solely because of his or her race, religion, gender, or ethnicity, when an attack occurs, entire communities are put on notice. The most recent FBI report on hate crimes shows an 11.7% rise last year in the number of violent hate crimes. The number of victims in anti-Latino or Hispanic hate crimes rose over 21% in 2018. Jews were the target of a stunning 57.8 percent of all religious bias crimes in 2018, despite making up less than 2 percent of the U.S. population,"" said the members.
""The coronavirus pandemic has brought out both the best and worst of our society. First responders, healthcare professionals, and so many frontline essential workers have indeed shown bravery in the face of fear. They have saved lives and ensured that we all have access to food, pharmaceuticals, and other necessities. Human solidarity has been on display as we face this unprecedented challenge together. However, as uncertainty rises, we have seen hatred unleashed. Conspiracy theories about the role of Jews in creating or spreading the virus swarm. Misinformation abounds.
""For this reason, we affirm our support for H.R.3545, the National Opposition to Hate, Assaults, and Threats to Equality (NO HATE) Act. The bipartisan bill will improve hate crime reporting through law enforcement training, allow for the creation of reporting hotlines, call for the increase in resources to liaise with affected communities, and promote public educational forums on hate crimes,"" the members concluded.

28,/content/Bias_Crime_Lexis_1.DOCX,CNN Wire,2020-12-30,1649 words,,"By Brynn Gingras, Faith Karimi, Carma Hassan and Nakia McNabb, CNN",,A Black musician's son was falsely accused of stealing a woman's iPhone.She disputes his account and accusations of racism,False," Prosecutors in New York City are investigating an incident in which a jazz musician said his 14-year-old son was attacked by a woman who falsely accused him of taking her iPhone.
Trumpeter Keyon Harrold posted a video taken with his phone that shows the woman making claims against his son on Saturday at the Arlo SoHo boutique hotel.
Harrold and his son are Black and were guests at the hotel in lower Manhattan. The ethnicity of the woman in the video is not clear, although New York police described her as White.
His video of the encounter has been widely shared on social media, prompting an outcry about what many felt was yet another incident of racial profiling against Black men. The hotel apologized and called the woman's behavior a ""baseless accusation, prejudice and assault against an innocent guest.""
The prominent jazz trumpeter spoke Wednesday at a news conference and rally near the steps of New York's City Hall, where he was accompanied by civil rights attorney Ben Crump and the Rev. Al Sharpton. He also followed a rendition of ""America the Beautiful"" with ""We Shall Overcome"" in the late December chill.
""If I wasn't who I was ... this wouldn't even be an issue,"" he said before a meeting with the district attorney that was -- according to Crump -- arranged by Sharpton.
Harrold, who is from Ferguson, Missouri, said he had been racially profiled himself throughout his life. He noted that the hotel episode could have ended ""wrongly"" had he not been with his son at the moment.
""I want my son to grow up whole. That's all we want. ... I come from Ferguson and this has been my passport to the world,"" Harrold said, pointing to his trumpet. ""And I can't even come downstairs in New York City ... and just go get brunch without being attacked and wrongfully accused of something.""
Kat Rodriguez, the teen's mother, said hotel management was equally culpable for not de-escalating the situation and for allowing the accuser to leave before police arrived. She demanded that the woman be charged with assault.
""This fight is not only for our son. It's for all of our sons and daughters,"" said Rodrigruez, who's a musician and a teacher. ""If we were a family that didn't have these connections ... if I was a maid, this story wouldn't have hit the news. What about those people that don't get to get heard?""
Rodriguez, growing emotional at times, added, ""I want to thank God because this incident could have ended very different. We have seen this ... I pray for the mothers and fathers who have lost their sons to racial injustice.""
Rodriguez and others at the news conference asked what would have happened if a Black man or woman assaulted a White child and tried to take their phone.
Rodriguez told CNN's Don Lemon on Wednesday that her son was ""traumatized and confused about why this happened to him.""
A spokesman for Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance said his office ""is thoroughly investigating"" the incident, and the New York Police Department told CNN that a complaint for harassment at the Arlo SoHo hotel has been filed.
After viewing surveillance video of the incident, investigators are considering charging the woman with assault and possibly grand larceny or attempted robbery, said Rodney Harrison, chief of detectives for the New York Police Department, on Tuesday
""The investigation is still preliminary, a lot of work still needs to be done,"" he said. ""The complainants are cooperating and I'm confident that the investigators from the first precinct will make an arrest on this case sooner than later.""
Many who have seen Harrold's video, including New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, have alleged racism.
De Blasio said Thursday that the woman should face charges.
""You have a teenager here who did nothing wrong, who was clearly profiled because he was young and male and Black,"" he told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on New Day. ""That is racism pure and simple, that is unacceptable in this city, in this country.""
Harrison said Tuesday that there are no plans ""at this time"" to charge the woman with a bias crime.
<h3>The woman disputes the accusations against her</h3>
The woman has not come forward, but CNN on Tuesday was the first news organization to talk to her by phone, and she disputed Harrold's account of what happened.
While the 22-year-old woman claimed she was assaulted during the altercation, CNN hasn't been able to corroborate her account with investigators or with the hotel where the incident took place.
In a 20-minute phone interview, she said the incident unfolded after she first demanded to see the hotel's surveillance video to try to pinpoint who may have taken her phone. She says she then asked someone else in the hotel lobby to ""empty their pocket,"" before ultimately confronting Keyon Harrold Jr., who she maintained had her phone in his pocket.
""That's when everything got a little bit more serious,"" the woman said referring to the interaction.
Throughout the phone call, the woman's account of the incident was rambling at times. She provided additional information of events preceding and unrelated to the incident that CNN has been unable to confirm.
When asked whether she's concerned about possibly facing charges and overall how she is portrayed in the video, she said, ""Of course I worry. That's not who I am. I actually ... try very hard to make sure that I am always doing the right thing.""
The woman told CNN that she is willing to cooperate with the ongoing investigation, but she hasn't received a call from the NYPD yet nor has she reached out herself. She also said she'd be willing to talk to the Harrolds.
After she agreed to provide evidence that could help confirm her claim that she was assaulted, she stopped responding to CNN's phone calls and text messages.
CNN is not naming her at this time because she said she has concerns for her safety unrelated to this incident.
CNN also requested a police report from the NYPD, but it declined to provide one, saying it typically does not in such situations.
<h3>Harrold says the encounter happened on the way to breakfast</h3>
Harrold said in an Instagram post that he and his son had left their hotel room to get breakfast when they encountered the woman. It's not clear what occurred before he started filming, but in the video, the woman can be heard telling Harrold's son, Keyon Harrold Jr., to show her his phone.
 The teen tells her ""this is my phone"" and his father tells him he doesn't have to explain anything to the woman. The woman comes closer to them, demanding the case be taken off the phone.
She then taps a male hotel employee on the shoulder and asks him to bring the phone to her. ""Literally get it back for me, please,"" she says.
The elder Harrold responds, ""Are you kidding me? You feel like there's only one iPhone made in the world?"" A man who identifies himself as the hotel manager asks to see the phone but the teen's father refuses. ""I'm trying to settle this situation,"" the manager says.
In the video, when Harrold and his son attempt to leave the woman approaches them, saying, ""I'm not letting him walk away with my phone."" The video then shows her on the floor, but it's unclear how she landed there. She approaches them again and the teen's father is heard shouting for her to get her hands off before the video cuts out.
In his Instagram post, Harrold said the woman scratched him and grabbed his son. He told NBC that after the video cut off, the woman, ""tackled my son, you know, trying to reach in his pockets, reach in my pockets.""
Harrold suffered slight injuries but his son was not injured, the NYPD said. His son told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" that he's ""shell-shocked . ""
""I don't know what would have happened if my Dad wasn't there, honestly,"" the teen said. Asked what he would say if he got the opportunity to speak to the woman, he said he'd expect an apology. Then he said he'd ask her, ""why would she do something like this to a kid who has never met you at all?""
The woman's phone was returned to her at the hotel moments after the incident by a ride-share vehicle she used to try to check into the hotel, Harrison said.
<h3>Hotel says 'more could have been done' to defuse the dispute</h3>
De Blasio on Twitter Monday called the incident ""racism. Plain and simple.""
""It would be horrific at any age, but it's especially offensive that it happened to a child,"" he said. ""To Keyon Harrold Jr. and his family: I am so sorry this happened to you.""
In a statement, Arlo Hotels said ""more could have been done to de-escalate the dispute.""
""We're deeply disheartened about the recent incident of baseless accusation, prejudice and assault against an innocent guest of Arlo hotel,"" the statement said. ""In investigating the incident further, we've learned that the manager on duty promptly called the police regarding the woman's conduct and that hotel security intervened to prevent further violence .... No Arlo guest -- or any person -- should be subject to this kind of behavior.""
Crump accused the hotel of empowering the woman's accusations by asking Harrold's son to prove his innocence and called for charges against her.
""As this year of racial awareness is drawing to a close, it's deeply troubling that incidents like this one, in which a Black child is viewed as and treated like a criminal, continue to happen,"" Crump said in a statement.
""We strongly urge Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance Jr. to bring assault and battery charges against this woman to send the message that hateful, racially motivated behavior is unacceptable,"" Crump added. ""This is what it will take to drive change. We also call for a civil rights investigation into the Arlo Hotel for its implicit bias in its treatment of Keyon.""

The New York chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-NY), the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, today called on the NYPD to initiate a hate crime probe after a Muslim father was allegedly assaulted in an apparent anti-Muslim attack.
The incident reportedly occurred on November 6 in Rego Park, Queens.
The victims of the alleged hate crime, 38-year-old Egyptian-American Khaled Aly and his wife, Neamat Taha, and their two children, age 6 and 8, were reportedly returning home on Friday night at approximately 11 p.m
As the family parked their car in their parking spot and went to walk into the apartment complex, the assailants confronted them and began to harass Taha. Taha wears a hijab, Muslim headscarf. The female assailant grabbed Taha while the male assailant began to aggressively approach Taha. Prior to grabbing Taha, the assailants told the family that “we are in America. ” Aly asked the assailants to leave them alone and to not touch his wife. Without warning, the assailants then attacked Aly and viciously beat him while his kids watched in horror.
During the assault, the assailants repeatedly cursed at Aly and called him a “f***ing Muslim” and threatened to “kill your f***ing family. ” Taha called 911 during the assault. As the NYPD arrived on the scene, the assailants fled.
Aly was immediately rushed to the hospital where he was hospitalized and underwent surgery for his ‎injuries. Aly was released from the hospital Monday evening. ‎

The alleged assailants have been identified as neighbors who live in the apartment complex. Despite having the identities of the assailants and witnesses to the violent assault, the NYPD has failed to make any arrest.
On Saturday at approximately 4:30 a.m as Taha returned to the apartment complex from the hospital, she was confronted by the male assailant who bragged about assaulting Aly and threatened Taha and her family stating “I’m going to burn you and burn your family. ” Taha was accompanied by male friends. Taha and her family have not returned to their apartment out of fear for their safety.
The family reports that the assailants have been harassing them over an extended period of time. The family previously filed a police report over the harassment. The family also reported the harassment and threats to the apartment complex’s management.
CAIR-NY Legal Director Ahmed Mohamed stated:
“Hate crimes targeting the Muslim community need to be taken seriously. Again and again we are seeing that bias motivated crimes targeting Muslims are being minimized and not properly investigated. Mr. Aly was beaten mercilessly in front of his young children, who are now traumatized, and the NYPD knows the identities of the assailants and where they reside. Yet, the NYPD has failed to make any arrests. It is outrageous and speaks to the lack of urgency to investigating crimes targeting the Muslim community. ”",Bias Crime

ATLANTA — In the most recent killing of a transgender woman, her body was found inside an abandoned car, burned beyond recognition. In another case, the woman was pulled from a lake at a Dallas park. And in a third, she was found dead near a golf course, just weeks after she survived a brutal beating that was captured on video.
In the United States this year, at least 18 transgender people — most of them transgender women of color — have been killed in a wave of violence that the American Medical Association has declared an “epidemic.” The killings, which have been reported across the country, have for some prompted a heightened sense of vigilance. 
“It’s always in the forefront of our minds, when we’re leaving home, going to work, going to school,” said Kayla Gore, who lives in Memphis. “Guys were flirting with me at the gas station, and the first thought was, ‘This could go horribly wrong.’”
Activists said the cases have also underscored the precarious position of many in a community that faces elevated levels of homelessness and poverty, and the hazards that can bring. 
The killings this year follow at least 26 recorded last year by the Human Rights Campaign. But transgender advocates noted that those figures fail to grasp the full extent of the perils the community faces, as data provided by law enforcement officials can be incomplete and many crimes are never reported.
The paucity of reliable data makes it difficult to measure whether violence against transgender people has increased. But many advocates say that hostility has intensified, as a rise in visibility has also stirred animosity and emboldened people to attack. 
The climate of fear reflects a widening gulf in the acceptance of transgender groups, which today have far more representation in popular culture. There are transgender or gender-nonconforming characters on television and in movies, and Mattel recently introduced a line of gender-neutral dolls. Yet that cultural progress has not trickled down to everyday life, particularly for those who are the most vulnerable. 
“We are the most afraid we’ve ever been,” said Mariah Moore, a program associate for the Transgender Law Center, who lives in New Orleans. “But we’re also stronger than we’ve ever been.”
Many transgender people said they have hunkered down, avoiding meeting people they do not know and sticking to places where they will have greater odds of staying safe. 
“A lot of folks are living in silos,” Ms. Gore said.
Between May and July — when pride events were taking place across the country — at least 14 L.G.B.T.Q. people were killed, according to a report from the Anti-Violence Project. Seven of the victims were black transgender women. 
“The increased visibility is a signal for them that they need to double down in fighting back,” Beverly Tillery, the executive director of the Anti-Violence Project in New York, said of those looking to harm transgender people. “We’re definitely seeing what we would call a backlash.”
The dangers, of course, extend beyond explicit bias crimes. Discrimination can stand in the way of housing, education and job prospects, pushing many transgender people into homelessness as well as into sex work, elevating risks to their safety. And for black transgender women, racism can compound the discrimination.
“The prejudices don’t add upon one another, they multiply upon one another,” said Sarah McBride, the national press secretary for the Human Rights Campaign.
Police departments have hired more L.G.B.T.Q. officers and have sought to mend strained relationships, but advocates say many transgender people avoid calling the police if they are threatened or even physically attacked.
Dana Martin, 31, was the first known transgender person killed in 2019, found shot to death in a vehicle in Montgomery, Ala., in January.
Since then, three transgender women have been killed in Dallas, including Muhlaysia Booker, a 23-year-old who was shot to death about a month after being brutally assaulted in an unrelated attack that was captured on video and garnered national attention. Another transgender woman in Dallas was shot several times last week and gravely wounded in an attack that the authorities are investigating as a hate crime. 
In Detroit in June, an 18-year-old man was charged with first-degree murder for the targeted killings of a transgender woman, Paris Cameron, and two gay men. 
The most recent killing, at least the 18th, took place near Clewiston, Fla. The body of Bee Love Slater, 23, was found in a scorched car on Sept. 4, her body so badly burned that she had to be identified with dental records. 
The series of killings has mobilized transgender and L.G.B.T.Q. groups, with calls for lawmakers to strengthen hate crime legislation and bar the use of the so-called gay- or trans-panic defense for people charged with attacks. They have also organized self-defense classes and guides on where to find affirming places to eat and shop. 
The violence against transgender women has been cited by several Democratic presidential candidates, including Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, and Julián Castro, the former housing secretary. At a candidates forum on L.G.B.T.Q. issues in Iowa last week, Senator Elizabeth Warren read aloud the names of those who have been killed this year. 
“We do not talk enough about trans Americans, especially trans African-Americans and the especially high rates of murder right now,” Mr. Booker said on Twitter after the Democratic debate in Miami in June. “It’s not enough just to be on the Equality Act. We need to have a president who will fight to protect L.G.B.T.Q. Americans every day.”
Jennicet Gutiérrez, a national community organizer for Familia: Trans Queer Liberation Movement, said she has had moments when people felt entitled to question her identity or insult her with transphobic comments. Some had threatened her with guns, she said, “or at times, they get very physical.”
“Fortunately,” she continued, “I have experience with those sort of attacks and have been able to survive and been able to organize my community and speak up and really challenge these injustices.”
Ms. Moore said she felt a call to action in 2017, after Chyna Gibson, a 31-year-old black transgender woman, was fatally shot in New Orleans. Ms. Moore, 31, said the killing in her hometown rattled her. 
Even so, she was already deeply aware of the risks she and other transgender people face. She recounted the time, in 2014, when she was attacked and had to leap from a third-story window to save herself, shattering her knees.
“I want us to live in a world,” she said, “where we don’t have to worry about walking out of our front doors and being killed because someone doesn’t understand who we are.”
Rick Rojas reported from Atlanta, and Vanessa Swales from New York.

As co-chairs of the Jewish Latino Congressional Caucus, we affirm the following:
Hate crimes do not just affect victims. Because the victim is targeted solely because of his or her race, religion, gender, or ethnicity, when an attack occurs, entire communities are put on notice. The most recent FBI report on hate crimes shows an 11.7% rise last year in the number of violent hate crimes. The number of victims in anti-Latino or Hispanic hate crimes rose over 21% in 2018. Jews were the target of a stunning 57.8 percent of all religious bias crimes in 2018, despite making up less than 2 percent of the U.S. population.
The coronavirus pandemic has brought out both the best and worst of our society. First responders, healthcare professionals, and so many frontline essential workers have indeed shown bravery in the face of fear. They have saved lives and ensured that we all have access to food, pharmaceuticals, and other necessities. Human solidarity has been on display as we face this unprecedented challenge together
However, as uncertainty rises, we have seen hatred unleashed. Conspiracy theories about the role of Jews in creating or spreading the virus swarm. Misinformation abounds. For this reason, we affirm our support for H.R.3545, the National Opposition to Hate, Assaults, and Threats to Equality (NO HATE) Act. The bipartisan bill will improve hate crime reporting through law enforcement training, allow for the creation of reporting hotlines, call for the increase in resources to liaise with affected communities, and promote public educational forums on hate crimes.
In 1990, Congress passed the Hate Crimes Statistics Act, which requires the Attorney General to collect data on crimes committed due to the victim's ""race, gender and gender identity, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or ethnicity."" For more than two decades, thousands of city, county, college and university, state, tribal, and Federal law enforcement agencies have voluntarily submitted hate crimes data to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr., Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 is the first statute allowing Federal authorities to understand, investigate, and prosecute hate crimes committed on the basis of actual or perceived ""race, color, religion, national origin, gender or gender identity, sexual orientation, or disability."" However, due to inaccurate and incomplete hate crime reporting, we lack a complete understanding of the national problem posed by hate crimes.
In the latest FBI report, more than 85 cities of over 100,000 residents reported zero incidents or did not report hate crimes to the agency. Syracuse, NY; Midland, TX; Hialeah, FL, are among the cities on this list. Managed through the Department of Justice (DOJ), this bill will issue grants to empower State and local governments to improve hate crimes reporting. These funds come from existing allocations and will not create new financial responsibilities for the federal government. In exchange for receiving grants, State and local governments must provide additional information pertaining to hate crimes in their jurisdiction. If they fail to do so, they must repay the grants in full. It also amends the penalties for hate crimes to allow courts to require that offenders engage in education about, or service to, the affected communities as a condition of their release from prison.
We hope that our colleagues on both sides of the aisle and in both chambers will ensure that this bill is passed and signed into law.",Bias Crime

He is found guilty and his punishment includes exclusion from the community, suspension of his academic privileges, a ban on taking leadership roles in campus organizations, mandatory meetings with appropriate officials to learn about correct ways of thinking and speaking, and the presentation of a formal written apology, to be submitted in draft form ""for approval.""
Readers would be excused for assuming that this occurred in some backward, repressive dictatorship or totalitarian regime, but these troubling events took place at an American University.
Austin Tong, a senior at Fordham University in New York State, posted two messages on his Instagram account. The first, on June 3, was a comment about the ""nonchalant societal reaction"" to the killing of David Dorn, a black, retired St. Louis Police officer. His second post, a day later, was a photo of himself holding his lawfully owned AR-15 rifle at his off-campus home. This was captioned, ""Don't tread on me,"" followed by the emojis of the American and Communist Chinese flags and a hashtag ""commonly used by Chinese citizens to avoid censorship of online discussion of the Tiananmen Square massacre.""
Mr. Tong is a Chinese-American who arrived in the United States as a six-year-old immigrant. He explained that his second post was made to commemorate the 31st anniversary of the suppressed 1989 Chinese Democracy Movement.
According to Mr. Tong, the university ""sent safety officers at midnight to interrogate me all over a simple picture of a lawfully owned gun."" Keith Eldredge, Fordham University's Dean of Students and Assistant Vice President, followed up by advising that he was initiating an investigation for bias/hate crimes, threats/intimidation, and disorderly conduct, based on these ""posts on social media related to the current racial issues in the country and political issues in China, including one in which you were holding an automatic weapon.""
Fordham University a private educational institution that is not bound by the First Amendment nonetheless professes its commitment to free speech and expressive rights. For example, its mission statement ""guarantees the freedom of inquiry required by rigorous thinking and the quest for truth.""
The university's Demonstration Policy opens with the following: ""By its very nature, the University is a place where ideas and opinions are formulated and exchanged. Each member of the University has a right to freely express their positions and to work for their acceptance whether they assent to or dissent from existing situations in the University or society."" Similarly, Fordham's policy on ""Bias-Related Incidents and/or Hate Crimes"" claims the University:
values freedom of expression and the open exchange of ideas. The expression of controversial ideas and differing views is a vital part of University discourse. Although the expression of an idea or point of view may be offensive or inflammatory to others, it may not constitute a hate crime or bias-related incident. While this value of openness protects the expression of controversial ideas, it does not protect or condone harassment or expressions of bias or hate aimed at individuals or groups that violate the Student Code of Conduct.
Regardless of these high-minded affirmations, the University concluded that Mr. Tong's posts devoid of threats, violence, intimidation, coercion, or harassment violated the university rules on ""Bias and/or Hate Crimes"" and ""Threats/Intimidation.""
A July 14 letter from Keith Eldredge (copied to the ""Department of Public Safety"") outlined the sanctions. Mr. Tong would be barred from the campus for the duration of his degree program. He was banned from representing the university or running for any student office or position. He would be required to attend instruction and complete activities on ""implicit bias,"" including a meeting with staff of the ""multicultural affairs"" office. He would have to submit a mandatory ""apology letter,"" to be approved by the university and a failure to comply would result in the university suspending or expelling him.
Perversely, the social media backlash to these innocuous posts has itself resulted in threats, intimidation, and potential bias/hate crimes against Austin Tong. It will be interesting to see whether Fordham University will enforce the same rules and policies against the activists from the university that ""flooded the comments section"" of his posts.
In the same way that the ""quest for truth"" supported characterizing his firearm indiscriminately as an ""automatic weapon,"" the university's commitments to ""freedom of expression and the open exchange of ideas"" protected Austin Tong, who was ""forcibly silenced, faced verbal and assaulting harassment from mobs, and subjected to Soviet-style interrogation and punishment."" Despite this, and the possibility that his academic career will be marred indefinitely due to these disciplinary actions, he has been steadfast in his defense of his constitutional rights.
In a video for the NRA, Austin Tong describes his decision to purchase a gun, adding that ""[h]ere in America, we have our right to keep and bear arms. This is what keeps America free.""

FULL TEXT
Introduction
This study describes the prevalence of victimization and its impact among a sample of the Roma minority in a Swedish context. In this study, the term ‘Roma’ is used as an umbrella term and refers to many ethnic minority groups that share a nomadic history, including the Roma, Travellers (in Swedish: Resandefolket), and others. It is estimated that there are up to 12 million Roma living in Europe and about 50,000 Roma living in Sweden (SOU, 2010: 55). Although this group cannot be defined as a single homogenous group, they face a number of shared challenges including exposure to discrimination and victimization.
In Sweden, the Roma have been subject to several officially recognized human rights violations during different ages (Westin et al., 2014). Furthermore, researchers have noted that the Roma constitute a vulnerable group in relation to victimization (Hall et al., 2014). Swedish official statistics estimate the number of anti-Roma-motivated hate crimes (or bias crimes) reported to the police in the year 2018 as approximately 160 cases, which is the lowest number of reported anti-Roma crimes since crimes with an anti-Roma motive started being registered as separate offences in the year 2008 (National Council for Crime Prevention [BRÅ], 2018). However, these official statistics are associated with several problems. There is a consensus among researchers with a focus on bias victimization that a significant amount of criminal activity is not officially recorded. In general, the Roma have a low propensity to report crimes to the police (Wallengren and Mellgren, 2018). It should also be noted that, in Sweden, there are no official data regarding the Roma community’s exposure to non-bias crimes, which makes it difficult to get a clear picture of the group’s victimization experiences. Few self-report studies concerning the Roma community’s victimization experiences have been conducted. According to one study by Wallengren and Mellgren (2015a), of a sample of 121 Roma living in the Gothenburg region of Sweden, 46% of the respondents reported having experienced at least one type of victimization during the last 12 months and one-fifth of the respondents had experienced anti-Roma-motivated victimization. As many as 84% stated that they had been the victims of an anti-Roma-motivated crime at some point during their lifetime. The study also found a tendency towards a higher degree of victimization among those respondents who were open about their ethnicity.
Even though researching a vulnerable population like the Roma presents numerous methodological challenges, there are many reasons for analysing the group’s victimization experiences. Firstly, the gathering of victimization data is essential in determining the extent of a group’s social problems and for the development of prevention strategies. Secondly, the vulnerable populations themselves may use such data to increase their empowerment, to point out their difficulties, and for lobbying, so that politicians (and others) are forced to acknowledge their experiences. Lastly, it is also possible that the research production in itself has a positive effect on the relationship between the majority society and the population. As often highlighted, the crimes that these vulnerable populations suffer are frequently perceived as a ‘message’– implying that the vulnerable populations are not full members of society and should ‘know their place’ (Perry, 2001). By producing research that highlights vulnerable populations’ suffering, society offers a counter message. It sends a signal that the specific group’s voices are of importance and that the group should be acknowledged as well as helped and protected.
The present study will contribute to this largely underexplored research field by reporting the victimization experiences of individuals who belong to the Roma minority in Malmö and Gothenburg, two of Sweden’s largest cities. A questionnaire was distributed and in-depth interviews were conducted to examine how visibility, i.e. the perception of the minority as being different from mainstream society, is related to victimization. In particular, we want to (a) investigate how visibility is related to the risk of victimization; (b) investigate whether study participants employ behavioural strategies to conceal group belonging as a means of reducing their victimization risk; and, finally, (c) analyse how these behavioural strategies affect the group.
Previous research and the study’s theoretical point of departure
Earlier research has shown that ethnic minority populations are significantly more likely to suffer from crime compared to non-minority populations. The most common way of explaining this pattern has been to draw inspiration from routine and lifestyle models (Cohen and Felson, 1979; Hindelang et al., 1978). According to this perspective, it is hypothesized that minority populations suffer from high rates of victimization as a consequence of living and working in high-risk environments, or that they suffer from crime as a consequence of being involved in norm-breaking activities themselves (Skogan and Maxfield, 1980). The criminal incidents to which the Roma are exposed may be explained by the group’s marginalized life situation. Research has shown that the Roma rank lower in many social indicators in comparison to non-Roma individuals in Sweden (SOU, 2010; 55). However, no empirical study has tested whether the Roma community’s marginalization can explain their crime exposure. Furthermore, as has been noted by several researchers, the most distinguishing feature of vulnerable populations’ victimization is that they are at risk of suffering from bias-motivated victimization and, thus, of being targeted by offenders based on their group identity (Perry, 2001).
Before a minority community can be targeted, they must first be made ‘visible’ and set outside the societal norm (Perry, 2015). Most theories that have sought to explain how negative attitudes develop towards different marginalized groups argue that it starts by a process through which an ‘Us’ and a ‘Them’ are constructed based on group identities. Several theoretical models have been developed that emphasize different social mechanisms that are believed to create these negative attitudes; most importantly, if the primary threat posed by the minority is viewed to be cultural or economic, there are several theoretical overlaps between them (Plous, 2003). The current dominant theory for explaining bias incidents is that of Barbara Perry (2001), who argues that bias crime is an act of violence and intimidation, usually directed towards already stigmatized groups and carried out to keep individuals down in a social hierarchy. Those who do not resemble the norm of an ‘Us’ come to represent an ‘Other’ that is less valued, at best, and directly stigmatized through various forms of discriminatory practices such as bias crime, at worst (Perry, 2001). This perspective is suitable for analysing the Roma since the group has a long history of being set apart from society (Selling, 2013; Westin et al., 2014). Chakraborti and Garland (2012), however, have criticized Perry (2001), arguing that the interpretation of bias crime as structural leads us to overlook its situational causes. They acknowledge that norms govern behaviour and occasionally give rise to bias incidents. However, they also present other factors that can cause prejudiced behaviour on a situational basis, including the interpretation of the victim as a vulnerable and easy target. Current empirical evidence gives support for bias crimes being driven both by cultural tensions and by lifestyle-related factors (Van Kesteren, 2016). This indicates the importance of analysing victimization on the basis of both social and contextual factors.
Thus, according to current theory development, a minority group’s visibility should constitute a risk factor for victimization. Some argue that this pattern is rooted in social power structures and that bias incidents serve both a symbolic and an instrumental function in controlling stigmatized populations (Goffman, 1963; Perry, 2001, 2015), while others argue that the pattern may be explained by the fact that a minority population’s visibility is related to the offenders’ ability to exploit their vulnerability (Chakraborti and Garland, 2012). It should be noted that it is not only physical visibility that is of importance. According to Goffman (1963), stigma becomes visible through the presence of what he calls ‘stigma symbols’, which may be linked to both physical appearance and behaviour.
Earlier studies have indeed noted that the visibility of minority groups is a risk factor for bias victimization. A study by Chongatera (2013), who studied racially visible minority populations in Canada, found that while higher income minimized the likelihood of exposure to bias victimization to some extent, visible race status appeared to be the major and independent determinant of the likelihood of experiencing such incidents. Studies have also focused on the fact that other aspects of visibility, such as whether individuals employ various symbols that signal group belonging, whether individuals practice their culture openly, or whether they have surnames that are perceived as non-normative, also increase the risk of exposure to bias incidents (Khosravi, 2012; Perry, 2015; Tiby, 2001; Wallengren and Mellgren, 2015a; Wigerfelt et al., 2014). Existing studies have shown that one of the most common strategies employed by potential bias victims is to reduce their victimization risk by applying behavioural strategies that reduce their visibility. Commonly used strategies include hiding one’s background, avoiding symbols that may signal group belonging, changing one’s names, trying to speak without an accent, and attempting to avoid contexts that are perceived to be particularly risky (Ford et al., 2012; Rai and Hesse, 1992; Wallengren and Mellgren, 2015a; Wigerfelt and Wigerfelt, 2015a). The use of these strategies implies that potential bias victims come to regard their visibility as a risk factor for victimization.
However, it should be noted that there appears to be some variation between different groups concerning the behavioural strategies employed. The strategy of concealing one’s identity seems to be primarily used by those who are able to hide significant identity markers. For example, the strategy of concealing group belonging has been reported in the Jewish community (Wigerfelt and Wigerfelt, 2015b) but not in the African-Swedish community (Wigerfelt et al., 2014). As regards the Roma, it is possible that different Roma can manipulate these markers in different ways. Two studies by Wallengren and Mellgren (2015a; 2018) provide indications that this is, in fact, the case. The first study examined the experiences of a bias crime in the Swedish Roma community. The second study examined experiences of victimization among EU migrants who support themselves by begging. While members of the Swedish Roma community were able to conceal their identity and did so frequently, the EU migrants did not perceive this as an option due to the necessity of being visible in public settings when they were engaged in begging. This study will contribute to and enlarge the research field by analysing how visibility is related to Roma victimization and victimization consequences in more detail.
Methods and data
The study of victimization concerning a vulnerable research population raises many methodological and ethical difficulties. A fundamental challenge when it comes to the Roma, in a Swedish context, is that we lack information about the size of the community, where they live and other related demographic characteristics. It is also a fact that many Roma are actively hiding their ethnicity from the non-Roma community (Wallengren and Mellgren, 2015a, 2015b, 2018). The lack of ethnic-based registration data and the group’s tendency to conceal their group belonging means that it is in practice impossible to gather a generalizable sample of the community.
To gain access to the field, many researchers have argued for the importance of including representatives from the study population in the research process (Kósa et al., 2007). A commonly used sampling strategy has been to contact members of such populations through their interest associations. However, samples obtained in this way are in many ways problematic (Wallengren and Mellgren, 2015b). In the planning phase of this study, Roma organizations were contacted, but few of these showed an interest in collaborating with the research team, and, ultimately, no organization helped with the data collection. Instead, we had to use other strategies to get access to potential study participants. Within this project, one of the authors (SW) belonged to the Roma minority and earlier had a role as a Roma spokesperson. For this reason, previously established contacts with individual Roma could be used to reach potential study participants. Through these contacts, 22 gatekeepers were contacted, of whom 16 were recruited. These gatekeepers were thus not attached to any particular Roma organization per se but could be described as ‘ordinary’ Roma with an interest in participating in the study. The gatekeepers did not receive any form of payment for participating in the study, or during the data gathering, other than being helped with regard to different costs related to their expenses. The data collection involved a two-phase process of both the distribution of a questionnaire and in-depth interviews.
Questionnaire
During the first phase, the research team wanted to distribute a victimization questionnaire to Roma living in Gothenburg and Malmö. The questionnaire was constructed based on earlier measurements commonly used in victimization surveys (Andersson, 2018). However, in view of earlier research on measurements that can be perceived as ‘too sensitive’ and possibly stigmatizing within the Roma community (Wallengren and Mellgren, 2015b), and after discussions with the study’s gatekeepers, it was concluded that some questions were not suitable to include in the questionnaire. This concerned questions related to the respondents’ socio-economic status, their living situation/geographical location, and their own criminal activities, as well as questions related to especially vulnerable subpopulations (e.g., questions to do with women’s victimization and that of the HBTQ individuals). Thus, such questions were excluded from the questionnaire and this has undoubtedly affected the study’s validity. However, it also made participants more willing to participate in the study and potentially increased their feelings of safety and security.
The anonymity requirement has been highly prioritized in this study. An advantage of this study’s approach of first contacting gatekeepers, who then distributed questionnaires to Roma respondents, means that no one, not even the research team, can find out who has responded to the questionnaire. The gatekeepers received a number of questionnaires in unsealed envelopes. They were instructed to give the questionnaires to individuals whom they considered suitable for the study. The only inclusion criterion was that the study participant should self-identify with the juridical umbrella term Roma, be living in either Gothenburg or Malmö, and be over the age of 16. It should be acknowledged that this approach gave the gatekeepers considerable influence both on the selection process and in the treatment of the study population (Bound, 2012). It was therefore important for us to point out to the gatekeepers that they should draw attention to the purpose of the study, that participation in the study was voluntary, and that the questionnaire should be answered anonymously. To ensure that the gatekeepers did not commit any ethical violations, the questionnaire also contained a formal letter of information about the study and contact details for the research team. In discussions with the data collectors, it was concluded that it would be difficult to translate the questionnaire into Romani chib. The reason for this is that Romani chib is a language but also to a large extent consists of different dialects that differ from each other too much for Romani chib to be used in surveys. The fact that many Swedish Roma lack language skills (SOU, 2010: 55) was also seen as a problem in using Romani chib in the questionnaire. Instead, the questionnaire was conducted in Swedish. The distribution of questionnaires took place between January 2015 and October 2016. The respondents were given two options for returning the questionnaires: either to return them to the person who had distributed them or to send them by mail to the research group in prepaid envelopes. In total, 750 questionnaires were distributed, of which 610 were completed, giving a response rate of 80%, which is high in comparison to earlier studies (Andersson, 2018: Tiby, 2001). During the data collection, some respondents phoned to verify the identity of the researcher and were not willing to complete the survey until the researcher’s identity as a Roma had been established. This shows the benefits of involving members of the community in the research process.
Measures
The background variables included in the questionnaire are: Gender (0=male, 1=female); Residence (0=Malmo, 1=Goteborg); Age (0=16–19 years, 1= 20–29 years, 2= 30–39 years, 3= 40–49 years, 4 = over 50 years of age); Housing type (0=privately owned apartment, 1= house, 2= rented apartment); and Subgroup membership (0=Traveller, 1= Swedish Roma, 2= Finnish Roma, 3= Non-European Roma, 4= Newly arrived Roma).
Regarding victimization, we asked respondents: ‘Have you experienced any type of crime during the last 12 months?’ (Answer categories, if yes, were: threats, harassment, or bullying [either verbal or written], minor assault and aggravated assault, robbery, burglary and discrimination.) The respondent could answer no (=0) and yes (=1). With regard to bias victimization, we asked respondents in a follow-up question if the incident they had suffered during the last 12 months was founded on hostility towards or prejudice against their ethnic background. The respondent could answer no (=0) and yes (=1). In a series of follow-up questions, respondents were asked to state how many times they had been victimized (‘Give a number’), where the victimization occurred (‘Name a place in free text’), and what their relationship with the perpetrator was. Response alternatives for the relationship with the offender were: friend, acquaintance, stranger, partner or ex-partner, family member or resident in the local area. The questions used allow for a wide range of behaviours that the respondent could interpret as a bias crime. The legal definition of bias crime (or hate crime) in a Swedish context can be found in two legal sections and one penalty enhancement rule. The first is unlawful discrimination (Chapter 16, Section 9 of the Swedish Penal Code), and the second is incitement to hatred (Chapter 16, Section 8 of the Swedish Penal Code). The crimes not covered by these sections are included under the sentencing enhancement rule, introduced in 1994 (Chapter 29, Section 2, paragraph 7 of the Swedish Penal Code). According to this law (Law, 1994: 306), when a motive for crime is to aggrieve a person, ethnic group or some other similar group of people, by reason of race, colour, national or ethnic origin, religious belief or other similar circumstances, this should be considered an aggravating circumstance when assessing the seriousness of the act. The legal definition thus includes the definition of bias crime applied in this study, but this study has a victim perspective, which means that it is the victim’s perception of the act that defines whether or not it was bias-motivated.
To investigate the role played by visibility in relation to victimization, three questions about visibility were included in the survey. The first was ‘Do you wear symbols or clothing that are associated with your background?’ Secondly, we included the question if the respondents actively try to hide their ethnicity: ‘Do you actively try to hide your background?’ (Answer categories: 0=Never, 1=Rarely, 2=Sometimes, 3=Always). Lastly, to obtain a more specific understanding of whether the respondents are perceived by others as Roma, we added a question: ‘Do you believe that most other people perceive you as you described your background?’ (Answer categories: 0=No, nobody, 1=A few people, 2=Yes, most people, 3=Yes, everyone).
Sample characteristics
The characteristics of the questionnaire respondents are briefly presented in Table 1. As we can see, the gender distribution was relatively even in the sample as a whole: women=313, men =297. It is not possible to compare the sample characteristics to the general Roma population since there is no ethnic registration in Sweden. However, when comparing the respondent’s characteristics with the general Swedish population it is clear that the respondents of this survey were significantly younger than the general Swedish population and to a lesser extent owned their housing (SCB, 2019). It is also clear that the sample contains an overrepresentation of the Roma subpopulation ‘Travellers’. According to estimates, it is believed that about half of the Roma in Sweden belong to the Traveller community (SOU, 2010: 55).

Interviews
In the second phase of the data collection, those who had participated in the questionnaire survey were asked whether they would agree to participate in interviews. Within the project as a whole, 52 individuals who had participated in the questionnaire survey contacted the research team. Subsequently, a selection of study participants was made, where the research group had the objective of obtaining a variety of individuals regarding Roma subgroup belonging, age and gender. In the end, 30 Roma individuals were interviewed. Before the interviews took place, the research team asked the study participants if they found the quantitative phase, and the interaction between themselves and the gatekeepers, satisfactory, and they were once again informed about the purpose of the study. Study participants signed a written consent form before any recording began. All interviews were recorded and then transcribed. The study participants were given a choice to be interviewed by another Roma individual (SW) or by a female non-Roma member of the research team (no one chose the latter). The interviews took place at a location of the study participants’ choosing, most of them in the study participants’ homes, but some at Malmö University. The majority of the interviews were conducted in Swedish, but some were conducted with elements of Romani chib mixed in with Swedish. The interviewed study participants are briefly presented in Table 2. Their names and ages have been changed to ensure their anonymity.

All of the interviewed study participants had at some time been exposed to a bias crime based on their ethnic background. The goal was that the interviews should be conducted individually. However, some study participants preferred for the interviews to be conducted as group interviews. This included Rosa and Peter, who were close friends since childhood; Hans and Ellinor, who were a married couple; Isabell and her daughter Tove; and Jan and his son Charles.
Analytical strategy
The following analytical strategy was employed to answer the study’s questions.
As a first step, we began with a descriptive analysis of the prevalence of victimization in the survey sample. In the second step, we conducted six binary logistic regression analyses in order to analyse how visibility is related to bias and non-bias victimization. We also included gender and age as control variables. Based on earlier theoretical frameworks, we hypothesize that visibility will be significantly related to bias but not non-bias victimization (see e.g. Chakraborti and Garland, 2012; Perry, 2001). In the third step, once the qualitative data had been collected these were analysed using thematic analysis (Braun and Clarke, 2006), in which we sought themes or patterns of relationships between key concepts. We focused on themes and patterns related to visibility and victimization. The analysis was conducted in five steps: (a) initial read-through of the material; (b) additional reading with a focus on recurring themes; (c) initial categorization of themes; (d) further processing of the themes; and (e) final categorization. Thematic development occurred in an inductive or ‘bottom-up’ manner, which means that the themes identified are strongly linked to the data themselves.
Results
Of the 610 respondents in the survey, 221 (36%) reported having experienced at least one form of victimization during the last 12 months, which could be compared to approximately one-fifth of the Swedish population as a whole (National Council for Crime Prevention [BRÅ], 2018) and 46% of respondents in Wallengren and Mellgren’s (2015a) pilot study of Roma living in the Gothenburg region of Sweden. Among the respondents, 23% reported that they had been exposed to more than one crime during the previous 12-month period. The most common types of crime that the respondents reported having experienced were discrimination (30.1%) and threats, bullying or harassment either verbally (25.2%) or over the internet (11.8%). The least common forms of victimization reported by the respondents were minor or aggravated assault (3.7% and 3.3% respectively). The majority of the crimes that the respondents reported having experienced over the last 12 months were perceived as racial bias crimes (52%) and, more specifically, crimes with an anti-Roma motive.
Men reported significantly higher exposure for both non-bias crimes (19.9%) and bias-motivated crime (23.9%) compared to women (approximately 10% of women reported non-bias victimization and 19.2% reported bias victimization). With regard to age, younger respondents were more likely to report being victimized; 52% of the respondents in the age group 16–29 years old reported victimization compared to 14.1% of respondents over the age of 40. Younger respondents also reported significantly higher bias victimization compared to older respondents (34.1% versus 6.6%). In a majority of the cases (approximately 70%), the perpetrator was a person known to the victim. In about 20% of the cases, the perpetrator was a member of the victim’s own ethnic community. The most commonly reported place of incident was the respondent’s living area, where more than half of the criminal incidents had occurred.
Some 55% of the respondents stated that they at least sometimes concealed their ethnicity. There were small but notable differences between individuals who never or sometimes concealed their ethnicity compared to respondents who most of the time or always concealed their ethnicity (37.4% of the first group reported victimization compared to 33.1% of the latter). Regarding bias victimization, 26.3% of individuals who never or sometimes concealed their ethnicity reported bias victimization compared to 9% of respondents who most of the time or always concealed their ethnicity. Respondents who tended to use cultural symbols reported significantly more victimization compared to respondents who seldom or never used such symbols (16.9% compared to 54.8%). With regard to perceptional visibility, 31.9% of respondents who reported that none or few individuals perceive them as Roma had been victimized compared to 34.3% of respondents who believed that most or everyone perceived them as Roma.
Visibility and victimization
The main purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between visibility and victimization. As we have seen, at the descriptive level, the results seem to support that visibility is related to bias victimization. To discover whether visibility has a more independent effect on victimization, binary logistic regression analyses were conducted for three types of visibility: symbolic visibility, perceptional visibility and concealment of ethnicity (the concealment of ethnicity scale have been turned). Gender and age were used in all analyses as background variables. As the predicted variable, we used victimization during the last 12-month period, both with and without bias motive. The result can be seen in Table 3.

As we can see from the analysis, we found a negative relationship between perceptional visibility and non-bias victimization but a positive relationship between perceptional visibility and experiencing bias victimization (for each unit’s increase in perceptional visibility, the odds are 0.27 times less to be exposed to non-bias victimization but an increase of 2.3 with regard to bias victimization). With regard to non-bias victimization, we also found a significant relationship with gender, where men were more likely to report victimization than women (the risk is about 0.57 lower for females). We also found age to have a negative relationship with reporting non-bias victimization (for each unit’s increase in age the risk was 0.20 times lower). Also with regard to reporting bias victimization, we found a significant relationship with gender, where men were more likely to report bias victimization than women (the risk is about 0.36 lower for females) and that age has a negative relationship with reporting bias victimization (for each unit’s increase in age we found the risk was about 0.60 times lower).
With regards to symbolic visibility, we found a negative relationship with non-bias victimization and a positive relationship with bias victimization (for each unit’s increase in symbolic visibility, the odds are 0.3 times lower to be exposed to non-bias victimization but increases by 1.85 with regard to bias victimization). Women were found to be significantly less likely to report non-bias victimization compared to men (with an odds of 0.6 times lower risk) and with regard to bias victimization we did not find a significant relationship. Age was significantly related to both bias (for each unit’s increase in age the risk was 0.45 times smaller) and non-bias victimization (0.27 times lower) with older respondents being less likely to report victimization.
With regard to concealment of ethnicity, we found a significant relationship between both bias and non-bias victimization (for each unit’s increase in concealment (i.e. increased visibility) the odds of reporting bias victimization increases 1.5 times while the odds decreases by 0.34 times for non-bias victimization). Regarding non-bias victimization, we found a significant relationship with gender, where women were less likely to report non-bias victimization compared to men (odds for women were 0.6 times lower) but for bias victimization we did not find a significant relationship with regard to gender. Furthermore, we found a negative association with age, where older respondents were less likely to report both non-bias victimization (for each unit’s increase in age the risk was 0.25 times smaller) and for bias victimization (the risk was 0.5 times smaller).
To summarize, the analysis shows that there is a relationship between visibility and bias victimization. This pattern is in line with theoretical frameworks that predict that ‘visibility’ should be related to experiencing bias-motivated crimes. The next section will deal with the qualitative data material.
Thematic analysis of interviews
The analysis of the interviews resulted in three overarching themes: (a) Roma visibility and vulnerability; (b) strategies to conceal visibility; and (c) resulting individual and community effects.
Roma visibility and vulnerability
All of the interviewed study participants claimed that the Roma are a vulnerable group with respect to victimization. Of the 30 study participants, 12 emphasized the group’s social disadvantage in the explanation of the group’s victimization risk. These study participants proposed that one reason that the Roma are more likely than non-Roma to be victimized is that they live in high-risk neighbourhoods and often lead marginalized lives where, for example, the prevalence of alcohol and drug usage is high. These study participants argue that the group’s socio-economic vulnerability makes it difficult for them to protect themselves from crime. However, Peter and Rosa argued that this is not true for the younger Roma, who are much better integrated into Swedish society than the older generation.
All of the study participants agreed that the main reason that the Roma are at risk of victimization is the majority society’s negative attitudes towards the group. Thus, the study participants did highlight that visibility is an important risk factor for explaining their victimization. However, even though some Roma subpopulations are claimed to be more vulnerable due to their physical appearance, all of the study participants except Vincent and Isabell pointed out that it is not physical appearance that is the main form of visibility risk factor. Instead, the study participants discuss a border form of visibility, in the sense that people in the individuals’ surroundings know about the study participants’ ethnic background through information about their family background.
Thus, the study participants appear to support the view that social disadvantage and ethnicity are both factors that increase the group’s overall vulnerability and victimization risk. In practice, however, it is argued that the aforementioned vulnerabilities are not entirely different from one another. The study participants claimed that different Roma families and individuals have different opportunities to conceal their ethnicity in different settings. Felicia, Diana and Vincent argued that it is harder for individuals living in communities characterized by an ethnically heterogeneous population to hide their ethnicity, due to an interest that people in such communities have in knowing what heritage a specific individual or family has.
Strategies to conceal visibility and combat victimization risk
At the time of the interview, all of the interviewed study participants reported using strategies, or having used strategies, to minimize their visibility and thus the risk of victimization. Commonly used strategies include hiding one’s background, changing one’s names and avoiding non-Roma contexts. The strategies resorted to vary across the individual’s life course.
Some of the interviewed study participants told us during our discussions that it was common for their families to try to hide their ethnicity in quite drastic ways. Some of the study participants even claimed that it had until recently been common for them to conceal their ethnicity from partners, family members or even their children. Rosa told us that she had tried to hide her ethnicity more or less throughout her entire lifespan. ‘I didn’t tell anyone that I was a tattare [authors’ note: ‘tattare’=a degrading term often used towards the Travellers]. Not my two husbands and not my children.’ Out of 30 study participants, 11 also told us that it is taboo for them to openly identify themselves as members of the community to outsiders, particularly if there is a risk that this might affect other community members. Furthermore, some of these study participants argued that if they are too open with their ethnicity to outsiders, there is a risk that other community and family members may stop associating with them, or even threaten and harass them.
However, nine of the study participants argued that although it is indeed common that some members of their community do hide their ethnicity in this way, individuals might lose their status within their community if they are perceived to be concealing their group identity too much from non-Roma. These study participants instead told us that they hide their ethnicity while applying for jobs or housing, and from neighbours or classmates, but not from family members.
In line with our conclusion in the earlier section, the study participants claimed that in certain instances it is not practical, nor always possible, to hide their ethnicity. In these circumstances, participants use other strategies to protect themselves. Most notably, study participants claimed that they scan new contexts for signs of risk and potential offenders. These study participants described a heightened awareness and increased suspicion. They described how they would ‘lie low’ but pay attention to how non-Roma talk, and particularly whether they make intolerant statements about different groups. Some study participants also claimed that they use more proactive behaviours to identify possible offenders, such as denigrating different racial groups (for instance, their own) and then reading the response.
Individual negative consequences of concealing group belonging
Researchers have observed that individuals who conceal their identity often perceive this strategy to be something of a double-edged sword (Meyer, 2003). Concealing one’s identity can provide a sense of security. However, in certain situations, it can also cause anxiety and fear. In this study, there were participants who told us that concealing their group belonging was relatively unproblematic. Concealing their Roma heritage in certain situations and contexts is something which the group, as David told us, ‘simply does’. According to these participants, the concealment strategy makes them feel safer or at least makes it possible for them to relax. They do not have to prepare themselves to discuss, explain or protect aspects of their ethnicity to non-Roma individuals.
At the same time, there were participants who told us that the concealment strategy was both ineffective and problematic in several ways. Firstly, hiding their identity makes many of the study participants feel dehumanized and ashamed. Furthermore, the participants do not trust their ability to conceal their ethnicity effectively. They told us that they feel that they always need to be on the alert and to make sure that they (or others) do not do or say anything that might make people aware of their group belonging. Secondly, by comparison with individuals who are open about their ethnicity, individuals who belong to a stigmatized community, and are successful in concealing it, may encounter situations in which they are forced to listen to ridicule and resentment focused on their community, from individuals whom they would probably not encounter if they were open about their identity. In this study, eight study participants testified that they had encountered situations in which individuals have talked negatively about ‘beggars’, ‘gypsies’ or ‘tinkers’ without knowing that the participants identified themselves with the ridiculed group. Thirdly, the study participants may not know exactly how others will react if they reveal their identity, or indeed if individuals in their surroundings already know about their group belonging. Individuals who are successful in concealing their identity do not experience being ‘challenged’ in their view that people in their surroundings may not have negative attitudes about their group. Five out of the 30 interviewed study participants told us different ‘coming-out’ stories and that they were sometimes surprised that loved ones did not care about their ethnic background or see it as something negative.
Empirical studies have shown that victims of bias crime are at risk of developing different forms of negative emotional, psychological and health outcomes as a consequence of their victimization (Iganski, 2008; Iganski and Lagou, 2015; Lehavot and Simoni, 2011; Mellgren et al., 2017). In this study, the participants often described how they had developed various problems as a consequence of living with a stigmatized identity and trying to combat this by using the strategy of concealment. There were participants who told us that they had become paranoid and that they had always lived with an intrusive feeling of being ‘looked down upon’ by other people. As a result, they described not trusting other individuals and said that they had developed an aggressive way of solving conflicts and that they had problems investing in social relationships. Some also said that they believed that it is common that individuals from their community who have these feelings are at risk of using drugs and alcohol to combat their anxiety, feelings of inferiority, self-hatred and isolation. Of the 30 study participants, 10 told us that they believed that they needed professional help to solve some of their psychological problems. As a final note, nine of the 30 study participants claimed that the feelings of stigma had affected their ability both to participate in Swedish society and to invest in their future. These study participants expressed a loss of self-esteem and human value and described having a hard time imagining who they would be and what their lives would be like in the absence of these behavioural changes, adaptations and feelings of inferiority.
Community consequences of concealing group belonging
It is clear from the study participants’ testimonies that strategies of concealment hurt the Roma community at large. These effects seem to cause frictions between members of the community, but they also, as we will see, seem to have had an impact on the Roma culture, both with respect to its expressions and in relation to individuals’ ability to participate in their culture and develop their cultural identity.
Study participants told us that they had employed strategies of concealment since childhood and that these strategies were taught to them by their parents. There was a number, particularly among the younger participants, who told us that they do not think that the concealment strategy should be used by the younger generations, because it is ineffective and also destructive. At the same time, most of the study participants have children, and it was common for them to express worry about their children’s safety and to question whether or not their children should hide their ethnicity. Maja, who was pregnant with her first child at the time of the interview, told us: I’m so happy, but it’s also strange. My husband and I are already thinking about my girl’s future. Should I encourage her to tell people about her background while she is a child, or should I tell her to hide it until she is older and can stand up for herself? In this study, both older and younger participants told us that they believe that there is a social mechanism present in their community whereby Roma children are, to some extent, socialized to anticipate stigma. Eight of the study participants discussed how they, as children or teenagers, had parents who often had an intolerant attitude to drinking, how their parents sometimes controlled who their children were allowed to meet, how they were told to be home early in the evenings, and, most importantly, how they were told not to tell people about their background. Most of these participants described this as an overly protective upbringing, even though it was well-intentioned, and also as somewhat problematic. In certain cases, they also reported having experienced feelings of isolation within their community as a result.
Some of the study participants told us that their parents did not tell them about their ethnicity until they were older. In other cases, families had been open about their family background but had remained secretive about their culture and were opposed to their children learning certain aspects of their culture, such as the language. The study participants who were raised in an environment in which the culture was ‘hidden’ sometimes expressed anger over the fact that they had lost some aspects of their culture or that they did not have the ability to gain or develop a ‘Roma identity’. In a group interview with Charlotte and her daughter Tove, Tove told us: I feel lost in all of this, and I don’t know who to blame. It’s frustrating; I haven’t been raised in the culture, not truly. There were also those who claimed that it is problematic that individuals who belong to the community try to hide their ethnicity and culture in more general terms. Morgan, for example, argued that one consequence of this concealment is that younger individuals have lost their culture and identity as Roma. During our discussion, he told us that: It isn’t good when they try to hide it. They stop speaking our language and then they are not Roma anymore. Thus, the fact that the group uses the strategy of concealment to a varying degree seems to have a profound effect on both individuals’ ability to practise their culture and their feelings of cultural identity.
As was noted earlier, some of the study participants told us that there is a taboo about being open with their ethnicity to outsiders. Some participants explained that this is a consequence of the fact that a ‘silent culture’ has developed in some of the Roma communities as a result of stigmatization. According to some, individuals who do not uphold this ‘agreement’ to keep the Roma culture protected from outsiders may be punished. Some individuals who participated in this study had been activists for Roma issues, and they stated that it was relatively common for them to have been discriminated against by other Roma, as many Roma do not want their culture to be shown to outsiders. These study participants argued that they did not engage in politics, because they believed that they would be discriminated against both by other Roma and by members of the majority society. One study participant, Morgan, criticized those who engage in the public debate relating to ‘Roma issues’: I find it immoral to go out and talk about our culture and problems with outsiders. They put us all at risk. We have never needed the government to help us keep our language or identity. It’s better that we keep quiet as we always have done.
Discussion
A liberal democratic society must guarantee individuals both safety and the opportunity to express, practise and develop their cultural, sexual or religious identity in the public sphere. This study has described the prevalence and impact of victimization among a sample of the Roma minority in Sweden. The results of this study contribute to our collective knowledge of the Roma community’s vulnerability to victimization. In this study, 36% of the respondents reported having experienced at least one form of victimization during the last 12 months and about half of these incidents (52%) were perceived as racial bias crimes committed with an anti-Roma motive. In the majority of cases, the crimes reported by the respondents were different forms of discrimination and verbal forms of harassment. Compared to the general Swedish population, the prevalence of the respondents’ victimization is high. However, the results of this study are in line with previous studies concerning the victimization experiences of Swedish Roma (Wallengren and Mellgren, 2015a), indicating that the group indeed is vulnerable to victimization and highlighting the importance of conducting self-report studies regarding the group’s victimization experiences.
One way of summarizing the study’s results would be that the degree of visibility and the expression of cultural manifestations that an individual carries with her seem to play an important role in shaping individuals’ victimization exposure risk, lives and opportunities. In line with current theoretical developments, we hypothesized that visibility would be related to bias victimization (Chakraborti and Garland, 2012; Goffman, 1963; Perry, 2015). We did find a positive relationship between our measurements of visibility and bias victimization (taking gender and age into account). However, based on this study’s data, it is not possible to determine whether visibility is an independent risk factor for experiencing bias victimization. It is possible that people who are more visible have different routine activities and encounter more risky situations than individuals who are less visible (Cohen and Felson, 1979; Hindelang et al., 1978; Wallengren and Mellgren, 2015a). As both the study’s survey respondents and interviewed study participants stated that they mainly were victimized in their living area, this could indicate that lifestyle-related variables indeed are of importance. A further explanation of the differences in levels of victimization between the visible and the less visible respondents may be that the more visible are more aware of (or sensitive to) perceiving different acts as bias-motivated, while less visible individuals do not. In the study’s qualitative data, it was argued that the main visibility risk factor is others knowing about the respondent’s ethnicity, not the group’s physical appearance. This corresponds well with the quantitative analysis where ‘perceptional visibility’ was found to be the strongest factor associated with bias victimization in comparison to ‘symbolic visibility’ and the strategy of concealment. The reason that physical visibility, according to the study participants, is not associated with victimization might be that non-Roma lack knowledge of the Roma community’s symbols, that the group’s physical appearance is not notably different from that of mainstream society, and also that individuals who belong to the Roma community are concealing their ethnicity.
This study also points to the problems of living with a stigmatized identity. A strikingly high proportion of the respondents in this study (55%) reported that they chose to conceal their ethnicity due to fear of victimization. Some of the study participants did not view this as problematic. Others, however, believed that the strategy had caused several forms of harm. In line with previous research, the study participants argued that, at the individual level, concealment caused feelings of dehumanization, shame, self-hatred, inferiority, fear and anxiety, and produced a lack of trust (Goffman, 1963). In addition to these individual-level effects, however, this study highlights the negative community effects of concealment. The study participants argued that the concealment strategy had in some cases limited individuals’ access to their cultural identity and that some individuals felt isolated in their communities. This study’s results also support the assumption that victimization and stigmatization have a disempowering effect on vulnerable populations and limit their ability to improve their societal position (Goffman, 1963). Several study participants argued that their stigmatization had affected their ability to live the life they would have wanted. Actual and perceived victimization directed towards marginalized communities could thus be viewed as a democratic problem that intensifies inequalities between different populations.
A number of limitations associated with the study must be acknowledged. First of all, since we lack population-level data on the Roma in Sweden, it is not possible to draw a random sample of the Roma population and thus generalize results. A subpopulation of Roma, the Travellers, were overrepresented in the current sample. Approximately 70% of the sample consisted of this subgroup, which is estimated to be about half of the Roma population in Sweden. This group is often believed to have a stronger socio-economic status compared to other Roma subpopulations (SOU, 2010: 55), limiting the validity of the study. Another limitation was that, for ethical reasons, we were unable to include background variables in the analysis related to the respondents’ lifestyles. In addition, the following two political developments occurred in Sweden during the planning phase of the study, which strongly prevented us including some of these background variables. One incident was the growing support for the populist party the Swedish Democrats (Sverigedemokraterna) and the polarizing debate that surrounded their growing support that scared many Roma living in Sweden at the time. The second incident contributing to the group’s unwillingness to respond to such variables was that the Swedish police in the autumn of 2013 had an illegal database of Roma consisting of 4000 individuals. It is likely that this incident has heavily damaged the Roma community’s trust in the authorities (Wigerfelt and Wigerfelt, 2015a) and by extension the research community. Finally, visibility is a somewhat problematic measure. The meaning of visibility is dependent on different individuals’ knowledge and perceptions, and it may vary between different historical periods and contexts. Our measurements for visibility are also, in reality, overlapping with one another and with behavioural strategies often used by victims of crime to minimize the risk of being exposed to victimization. However, we do believe that our use of a mixed approach made it possible to overcome some of these limitations. The methodological choice of using a mixed methodology approach enabled the participants to reflect on and explain various difficult concepts relating to their victimization experiences and consequences of victimization. It also enabled the research team to capture the study participants’ experiences and perceptions of different forms of social problems that were perceived as too sensitive to gather during the quantitative phase of the study. We would argue that our use of a mixed methodology approach, allowing the survey and interview data to inform one another, strengthens the study’s validity and provides us with a deeper understanding of the group’s experiences and the relationship between visibility and victimization.
Further research and policy implications
The study’s finding that the Roma are experiencing a high prevalence of victimization, and that visibility seems to be an important risk factor in explaining this pattern, calls for action. We do not claim that the current study provides any significant answers to many of the difficult questions facing those who are interested in developing policies to support vulnerable populations in relation to victimization. However, we would argue that some implications might be drawn from the study’s results.
Firstly, we believe that members of the Roma community may be experiencing problems associated with the acknowledgment of their Roma identity. The so-called Roma have a shifting view of their ethnicity, and some are critical of the use of the Roma label. This is problematic. It is possible that such individuals will not seek support or help if their self-proclaimed identity is not acknowledged. It is also possible that different forms of messages from mainstream society that are intended to show support towards the ‘Roma’ may have the opposite effect on those individuals who do not identify with the community. It is important that Swedish society develops an understanding of the complexities of the inner lives of those living in this community and respects their self-proclaimed identities. Also, we would argue that the study highlights a number of criticisms that may be directed at the hypothesis that bias victimization is more damaging than non-bias victimization due to the fact that bias incidents are intended to damage the victim’s ‘self’ (Iganski, 2008; Perry, 2001). As has been highlighted by Andersson (2018), the object that is targeted in a bias incident is not the self of the victim, but rather a negative stereotype. The participants in this study suffered both victimization and fear of being victimized as a result of their ‘Roma’ ethnicity, irrespective of whether or not they identified with this particular label or group. We would argue that further research should consider bias incidents as a violation of the victims’ opportunities for self-representation, but not necessarily of their self and their identity.
Secondly, it is clear from the study’s findings that there are some Roma who fear the ‘coming-out process’. There is, therefore, a need to develop strategies to support these individuals. We would like to highlight the fact that, according to the results of the current study, there appear to be control mechanisms within the Roma community which mean that those Roma who question the concealment strategy may be discriminated against by their community. This is problematic since there is evidence that the negative consequences of victimization may be more severe if one is victimized by individuals with whom one identifies (Herman, 2015). Also, those Roma who become involved in politics appear to be most at risk. Future research should further investigate this issue. It may be particularly important to gather data on those Roma who are engaged in the political debate on Roma issues.
Finally, being visible in a given society is not in itself inherently disempowering. Being invisible in the political sphere may also cause powerlessness (Perry, 2015). This study shows the importance of gathering and having access to data on different vulnerable populations in society. As a result of a relatively recent wave of migration to Sweden, Swedish society is not as homogenous today as it was a century ago. There are also indications that certain ethnic groups are faring a great deal worse than the ethnic Swedish population in several social aspects. However, due to Sweden not collecting demographic statistics on minorities, it is difficult to draw any conclusions about the situation of different groups regarding, for example, victimization, health or employment. We would argue that Sweden should review the possibility of developing equality data as a means of supporting its minority populations. Some minorities would no doubt be critical of the collection of such data, including the Roma. However, if such data were to be collected, it would also provide the community in question with the opportunity to use this information to support their community more effectively. Until such data are available, researchers should devote their attention to developing strategies for obtaining access to the difficult research field of vulnerable populations. Providing support to society’s marginalized and stigmatized populations is both necessary and important, and as this study has shown, the Roma is one such population.

New York Times reporter Tim Arango jumped on what may be the paper's last chance to blame physical assaults against minorities on the president, in Tuesday's: 'Hate Crimes At Highest Since 2008, F.B.I. Reports[1].'The notorious, discredited Southern Poverty Law Center also had a feature role. Here was The Times's four lead graphs (click 'expand'): Hate crimes in the United States rose to their highest level in more than a decade last year, while more murders motivated by hate were recorded than ever before, the F.B.I. said on Monday.The sharp rise in homicides driven by hatred -- there were 51 last year, according to the F.B.I. -- was attributed in large part to the mass shooting in El Paso in August 2019. In that shooting, the authorities say a 21-year-old gunman motivated by hatred toward Latinos stormed a Walmart and killed 23 people and injured many more.The death toll in the El Paso attack more than doubled that of 2018's deadliest hate-motivated crime, the mass shooting targeting Jews at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.'It's important to note that, because of the nature of hate crime reporting, the F.B.I.'s annual report vastly understates the real level of hate crimes in the country,' the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups, said on Monday. 
Hmm. Let's look at just who The New York Times considers a reliable source of information on hate crimes: The discredited, fundraising obsessed hysterics at SPLC[2] actually put outspokenMuslim apostate Ayaan Hirsi Ali, who still relies on security against death threats from Islamic radicals, on its blacklist of hatemongers. (They withdrew the smear under pressure, and had to settle a lawsuit by another ex-Muslim unfairly placed on the list.)And when the SPLC labeled the conservative Christian lobbying group Family Research Council on a 'hate group' map, it caughtthe attention of Floyd Corkins[3], who stormed the FRC's headquarters on a mission of slaughter. (The Times ignored the connection.)It's no surprise who the paper blames for yet another alleged rise in hate crimes (which may be boosted by exploiting increased reporting during the term of a president loathed by the left): The upswing in hate crimes last year underscored the upward trend in bias-motivated crimes during the Trump era, and the harsh rhetoric against Latino immigrants was seen as motivating the gunman in the El Paso shooting.'Politics plays a role,' said Brian Levin, a professor at California State University, San Bernardino, and the director of the university's Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism.'The president's rhetoric has been identified in a series of actual attacks,' Mr. Levin added, 'but moreover the day-by-day ticks of F.B.I. hate crimes shows there are increases after sustained and fervent remarks by the president that enter into an online feedback loop that also ends up in other discourses, both at the water cooler and on television.' Whether reporters are seizing on the FBI's annual report or exploiting a tragic shooting, the Times has spent four years blaming Trump for ""hate crimes.""Peter Baker and Michael Shear made clear who they thought shared the blame[4] of the 2019 El Paso massacre in'In Texas Gunman's Manifesto, An Echo of Trump's Language."" They lamented that Trump 'uses the word 'aliens' to refer to immigrants long after it was deemed dehumanizing even by other Republicans[.]'A week later the paper filed a long front-pageinvestigative report[5]: 'How the El Paso Gunman Echoed The Words of Right-Wing Pundits.' Yet the paper made no mention of theradical environmentalist streak of the killer's manifesto. It even shared a title with a climate change documentary by Al Gore: 'The Inconvenient Truth.'Trump has also been held responsible for hate crimes against U.S. Muslims[6], said reporter Eric Lichtblau in 'Level of Hate Crimes Against U.S. Muslims Highest Since After 9/11 - Some Tie Attacks to Trump's Statements.'

TEXT: CUOMO PRIME TIME.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
C. CUOMO: California, Texas, and Florida, the three most populous States in our country are now bursting with COVID cases, thousands of new infections being reported every day. The crisis is getting worse in this country in at least 23 other States.
Turns out the virus didn't take a summer break, just as we were warned.
Now, you will not hear the President, and I argue, any Republican leader within his earshot, say any of what I just told you. And it is all facts. But here's the truth that we have to now accept.
Masks matter. The resistance to masks is stupid politics, even worse, a symptom of a cancerous political culture that's making us even more sick than COVID.
Denial is not a strategy for dealing with the pandemic. You know who said that? The Governor of New York. One of the three States originally hit hardest, remember? New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, those epicenters, went from Oregon, Washington, California, then here.
But now, those three States on the East Coast are reporting the lowest numbers of infection rates. What did they get right that isn't happening in the States that are now in crisis? And those three States also have a big announcement all over the news today.
New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut are jointly declaring restrictions for travelers, a 14-day quarantine for those coming to those three States from the eight States with the highest infection rates.
Now, this is going to be controversial. Why is it the best way to keep numbers down? Joining us now with answers is the Governor of New York, my big brother, Andrew Cuomo.
How are you doing, Guv?
GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): Good thing you gave me credit for that ""Denial is not a life strategy."" I was going to come right through that camera if you tried to steal that line.
C. CUOMO: Well I changed it a little. You did say ""Denial is not a strategy for life."" You've told me that many times. But I continue to do it. And I--
A. CUOMO: OK.
C. CUOMO: --just expanded it to pandemic.
So, here is the question for you. What do you now know for sure, from your experience in your State that you have to do, in order to get cases down that isn't being done in these cases where they're popping?
A. CUOMO: Yes, look, and you're right. And we talked about this early on, and you had the right questions. You didn't have the answers. But you're not in the answer business. I am.
There were two theories that were posed to this nation.
The President said basically, ""Don't worry about COVID,"" the denial strategy. It was inconvenient. It got in the way of his economic story. So, ""It was just the flu. It was going to disappear. Don't worry about it. Liberate the States. Liberate New York. It's all about the economy."" That was option ""A.""
Option ""B"" was the course that we took here in New York, that it's not a political issue. This is a virus. And there's no political strategy to deal with the virus. It's not Democratic. It's not Republican.
And you have to use the science, and you have to use data, and you have to use metrics, and you have to do the testing. And there is no choice between a public health strategy and an economic strategy. Either you do both or you do neither. And I'm not going to sacrifice life for the economy. And it wouldn't work anyway.
Those were the two theories. We tested them, Christopher. You have some States who followed the President's thinking. And you have New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and some other States that did a science-based reopening. Science-based reopening worked.
You had to withstand the political pressure, you're right. But people stood up and they did it.
And look what you see now. You see 27 States that are going up with the viral transmission. You see the Dow Jones going down, why, because if you didn't take care of the virus, you're not going to have the economy come back.
And now that you started this reopening, and people see the virus going up, it's shaking the economy even worse than if you had started more gradually, but that the market could have confidence in what you were doing.
C. CUOMO: The two excuses--
A. CUOMO: So, New York took a very different track.
C. CUOMO: The two excuses--
A. CUOMO: Go ahead.
C. CUOMO: --that will be offered up, as a counter to the argument, is one is, ""Look, this was always going to happen. New York got hit first, and then it was going to move around the rest of the country. That's all this is.
[21:05:00]
And the only reason that these cases are coming up is because we're testing so much, and this is really just a false alarm put out by Cuomo and others who want to hurt the President. It's just more testing.""
A. CUOMO: Yes.
C. CUOMO: ""Test less.""
A. CUOMO: Right.
C. CUOMO: ""And you'll be fine.""
A. CUOMO: I got it. Yes. Good. Except it's factually bogus, right? You can say whatever you want to say, but it's bogus.
First, on the testing argument, that's what they're saying. ""We're getting more cases because we're doing more testing."" Oh, really? Then how come more people are walking into the hospital? What does it mean when you walk into the hospital except you are sick? All right, forget the testing numbers. Hospitalizations are going up. ICU beds are going up. You have hospitals that are near capacity now. How do you explain that, but that more people are getting sick, right? So, it just - it makes no sense on its face.
Second, the argument about New York, we had a much worse hand than anybody else was dealt.
C. CUOMO: Why?
A. CUOMO: Remember what they did to New York. Because the Federal Government, back when this started, January, February, March, they were saying ""It's coming from China. It's coming from China. It's coming from China.""
No, Federal Government. You were too slow. It left China. It went to Europe. Nobody even saw it get to Europe. And then it came to New York from Europe.
January, February, March, 3 million people on flights from Europe landing in JFK. They brought that virus here. It took off like fire through dry grass. They did the European travel ban March 16th. It had already been here for months.
Our numbers went through the roof, not because it was endemic to New York, or our water, or our air, or our accent, but because it came from Europe and the Federal Government missed it.
We had to turn the curve. These other States, all they had to do was stop it from going up, when in New York, it was already up, Chris. We had to bend the curve. And God bless the people of New York. You're talking about masks now? We did that, two months ago.
New Yorkers heard the facts. They believed in government. They believed in the State government. They rallied together. They were community. They were together. It was beautiful.
C. CUOMO: You came on the show with a mask on, early on.
A. CUOMO: And they did what no other State in this country--
C. CUOMO: Do you remember that?
A. CUOMO: Well that was to cover my nose. That - that was different. That was different.
C. CUOMO: That would have been a hell of a mask.
A. CUOMO: But yes, we were way ahead of the curve.
C. CUOMO: But you came on. You were making it, even when people were saying, ""Mask, oh, very controversial.""
So now, you have the three States coming together, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut. There's been a lot of sharing of information and of responsibility. And now the move is making all these headlines, quarantine.
The eight States that you three Governors believe are not doing what they need to do. You're not going to let them expose your States to risk. They're going to have to have a 14-day quarantine, if they come to you.
Now, why is that a good policy, in light of the fact that when people were threatening to do that to you guys, early on, you didn't like it? You thought it was wrong, and you said, ""I'm not going to close my borders.""
A. CUOMO: Yes. Not to correct you on the facts, because it's your show and they're your facts.
C. CUOMO: But?
A. CUOMO: Your opinion.
But there are still facts. First, the Federal Government wanted to blockade New York, OK? Federal blockade hasn't been done since the Civil War.
They were talking about closing bridges, and tunnels, and saying ""You cannot leave New York and you cannot enter New York."" That was illegal. It was unconstitutional. And I said that would start another Civil War.
States do have authority over their public health, and they can quarantine. What we're saying in New York now, and also Governor Murphy in New Jersey, and Governor Lamont in Connecticut, look, we fought like heck to get our infection rate down.
We have the lowest infection rate, Christopher, in the United States of America. We went from the highest infection rate in the country to the lowest transmission rate.
C. CUOMO: And you don't think that's just time?
A. CUOMO: New Yorkers killed themselves to do that.
C. CUOMO: Because people will say ""Oh, it's herd immunity.""
A. CUOMO: Well no, of course not time.
C. CUOMO: ""It moved its way through.""
A. CUOMO: Yes. But they'd be wrong. There is no herd immunity. Herd immunity is 50 percent, 60 percent, 70 percent infection rate. We're nowhere near that. Highest we got was about 22 percent.
No, it's not time. You just let it go, it will continue to increase. That's what you saw in New York in that whole first phase. We shot up to 18,000 cases over 60 days. This thing communicates and transmits like no one's business.
No. If you don't get ahead of it - the only one that tried herd immunity was Sweden.
C. CUOMO: Yes.
A. CUOMO: And then they said, ""Whoops! That was a mistake.""
C. CUOMO: Yes. Fair point.
A. CUOMO: No. It's because we got control - we got control of it. So, we don't want to go backwards.
[21:10:00]
So, we have to, one, make sure that we stay diligent, and the local governments do the compliance, et cetera. But two, we don't want people coming here, bringing the virus. All you need is one ""Super spreader."" New Rochelle, one person infected hundreds. And a lot of people come to New York and the Tri-state area from other places. We just want to make sure we don't import the virus, because we learned that lesson, been there, done that, when the Federal Government failed to tell us that the virus was coming from Europe.
C. CUOMO: How confident are you--
A. CUOMO: That's what we're saying--
C. CUOMO: --that the United States didn't have to be in the position it is of having the most cases, of being so far behind other countries that are, frankly, not as developed as the United States, in terms of public health, or resources?
How confident are you that we did not have to be in the position we are in right now?
A. CUOMO: It's - it's not a question of belief. It's not a question of politics, OK? Otherwise, you fall into their trap. It's science. It's science.
Look at the numbers in New York. How did you go from the highest infection rate in the country to one of the lowest infection rates in the country? How did you do that? On the numbers, mathematically, as a matter of science, you got control of it.
We had two different messages and two different strategies. And you had half the country saying ""It's the flu. It's nothing. Don't worry about it. Today, stop testing. Testing is the problem.""
I mean, how ludicrous! People are walking into the hospital. How can you say it's testing? It is denial. It's a failure of leadership. It's all political.
He - the President wants to run on the economy. He thinks this is a problem for the economy. He actually created a problem for the economy, because the markets have no confidence that he is in control of this virus. And that's his economic problem now.
C. CUOMO: Well and also time is poison, economically. And the longer this goes, the more - I mean I know you know this with your own budget woes in New York State. You're losing revenue. People need help. Time is a devil in this, and certainly, we've extended this beyond where we needed to.
Let me take a break.
When we come back, I want to talk to you about the challenges going forward, in terms of this feared second wave, although now, as Dr. Fauci says, ""We're not done with the first wave, so how are we going to have a second wave?""
And also the challenges for your State and this country in dealing with this search for equal justice and equal opportunity, what will New York do? Next.

(END VIDEO CLIP)
C. CUOMO: All right, we're back now with the Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo.
Good to have you, big brother.
The quarantine, 14 days, you say this is different than what they wanted to do to New York. Fair point! But the idea of enforcing this quarantine from those eight States, how do you enforce something like this?
A. CUOMO: When you land in this - they're basically South and Southwestern States. When you land in New York, you come through an airport. We know who you are. We know what flight you took. And we'll do random checks.
You can get pulled over by a police officer who could ask you questions. You could go to a meeting, and somebody could ask you, and call the Department of Health. So, there are a number of ways to enforce it.
We're not going - some States brought in the National Guard to do it. We're not going to do anything like that.
C. CUOMO: So, this is going to be a little bit of an honor system, and you're counting on people to do the right thing?
A. CUOMO: No - it's an honor system. But if you violate it, and an Inspector calls you, or shows up at your address, and you're not there, you break the law. You'll have a mandatory quarantine, and you'll pay a several thousand dollar simple penalty.
C. CUOMO: I'm saying it's going to be tough to enforce. But you can only do what you can do. I got you.
Another question. California, early on, was very aggressive. They did a lot of the things that you did in New York. Why are they still suffering?
A. CUOMO: Well, the - California started with smaller numbers, right? We started with that large spike from Europe.
They started with smaller numbers. I don't know exactly why they're seeing the continued increase that they're seeing. The - in California, it's slightly different. You have different counties with different strategies.
Los Angeles is doing one thing, San Francisco and the surrounding counties are doing something else. They're having different results, depending on the strategy. Los Angeles, I think, is driving the numbers right now.
New York, we did it differently. We had one strategy. It applied all across the State.
The local governments didn't make their own strategies, their own plans. I thought that was confusing. If you have one set of metrics that works, then everybody should live with that set of metrics, and that's what we did in New York.
C. CUOMO: Tale of Two Cities going on in this country. You have ""Trump says"" and then you have what ""Reality says,"" very often. On several different levels, we see this, so I'd like your responses to them.
When it comes to Cuomo, the President says, ""Hey, hey, don't give him so much credit. First of all, I did everything that he wanted. And that's why things went well for him in New York."" Fair?
A. CUOMO: No.
No, look, the President - first of all, his posture with COVID is fundamentally different than my posture with COVID, right? He always saw it as an inconvenient intrusion.
I thought as - I saw it as one of the greatest public health threats in modern political history. And I thought we ought to take it very seriously, and address it head-on, and stand up and tell the people the truth.
And that's exactly what I did, every day. I gave them the facts. And then I said, ""Here are the facts. You tell me what you think. Here's my opinion."" But I just told the people the truth, and I believed they would do the right thing, if they heard the truth, and they did.
I think the President's strategy was different. He wanted to minimize. He was going to market ""This is not really what it appears to be,"" and it was distortive.
It was not true. And it was counterproductive because denial is not a life strategy. And the virus is going to catch up with you. And it's catching up with 27 States right now. So, we had a fundamentally different posture.
[21:20:00]
The President did help New York. He sent the Army Corps of Engineers to build the Javits Center. Thank you very much. He sent 4,000 ventilators. Thank you very much. The Army Corps of Engineers came and helped us build alternative facilities. Thank you very much. So he - he was of assistance.
C. CUOMO: Sent the ship.
A. CUOMO: There's no doubt. Sent the U.S. Navy Ship Comfort.
C. CUOMO: Right.
A. CUOMO: Thank you very much, Mr. President.
C. CUOMO: Nursing homes, people died there. They didn't have to. It was mismanaged. And the operators have been given immunity. What do you have to say about that?
A. CUOMO: The - several statements that are not correct. But that's OK. It's your show. You say whatever you want to say.
The nursing homes were the most tragic situation. You had senior citizens. They were the most vulnerable to this COVID virus. They were in a congregate setting. And we lost lives, all across the country, in nursing homes. There is no doubt.
And we have to figure out how to do it better the next time because there will be a next time, either a second wave, or another disease. And if it is a disease that preys on the old, and the weak, it's going to go to the nursing homes and the rehab centers.
New York is one of the best cases in the nation for the number of deaths in nursing homes. The New York Times did a report, said we were 35th out of 50 States. We did a report, in the State, that we're going to issue that says we're 37 out of 50 States.
So, comparative to the other States, we did well, because it is a national crisis. But it's - it's false hope. We lost a tremendous amount of senior citizens.
In this State, about 38 percent of the deaths were senior citizens. Now, we knew that the vulnerable population was senior citizens. But we still have to find out how to do a better job if this virus comes back in a second wave. C. CUOMO: And giving the operators' immunity?
A. CUOMO: The operators have very strict laws in this State. And if they violated the law, they're going to be held fully accountable. We have an ongoing investigation now with the Department of Health and the Attorney General to make sure every operator was following the law during this crisis.
C. CUOMO: So, in terms of what we need to do going forward, you've made a good case of what works in New York.
Could work all over the country in terms of masks, and calling on communities, and being straight, and telling them the cases, and not playing with testing and contact tracing as a bad thing. More information is never bad.
How do those translate into the other virus that is attacking our country right now, which is division?
The idea of systematic racism and systematic inequality for the Black community is something you've addressed early on here. Do you believe there is any real chance for change on a national scale?
A. CUOMO: Oh, yes. Look, let's make sure we have the formula right, OK, if you want to take COVID, and you want to extrapolate to Mr. Floyd's murder.
The formula for COVID was, ""Tell the people the truth. Have a credible source that tells them the truth or develop credibility, and tell them the truth, and then social action.""
The way we're battling COVID is, ""Here are the facts. I'll give them to you every morning, but then social action. We have to do something. Testing, tracing, stay home, masks, social distancing, hand sanitizer, disinfect the trains.""
On the Mr. Floyd's murder, you have a galvanized public. In a way, I've never seen it galvanized before, and I say thank God. I said from day one, ""I stand with the protesters.""
Why did it take so long? 30 years ago, Rodney King, Amadou Diallo brutalized, Eric Garner, six years ago? I don't know. But it's here now. And it's a precious opportunity, if you have the social action.
People want change. They don't know how to make it happen, and they don't exactly know what the change is.
What we're doing in New York, because I want New York to lead the nation on this, Chris, we have 500 police departments in the State of New York. I sent them all notice.
You have nine months to come up with a plan that reinvents your Police Department as a collaborative. Local electeds, community activists, everybody sit at the table and reinvent the Police Department, so that there's trust and respect from the community to the police and vice versa. Take this moment, which is beautiful, and this is when change happens, but you need the vehicle to have the actual social action. And that's what we're going to do.
Take all these phrases, ""Defund the police! Demilitarize the police! Escalation! More visibility! More transparency! Civilian review!"" OK, what does that mean?
[21:25:00]
And let's do it community by community, because the New York City Police Department is a little different than the Albany Police Department. And every community has to come up with a Police Department that it wants, right?
The police were not sent down from heaven. They're not in the New Testament.
The Police Department is whatever Police Department the people want because they pay for it. You know, we have it a little backwards now. ""Well the police are this way and that's the way it's going to be."" No. It's going to be the way the people want it to be. They are public servants.
So, sit down, community, and put everyone at the table, work through these tough issues, but then design the Police Department you want. But you actually have to do it, so we can capitalize the moment, and actually have change, rather than just a lot of energy.
C. CUOMO: But you know that the minority communities can't do it for themselves because they don't have the power. So, how do you get the powerful to align with the interests of the un-powerful? How do you get the ""Haves"" to work with the ""Have-nots?""
Because, you know, as you've been telling me my whole life, you know, the policing is a function of high crime. High crime is a function of high poverty. High poverty is a function of low opportunity.
So, you come back to those type of things, it becomes just as much about class as it does about race in some ways. Of course, you have unique problems within the Black community and policing culture.
But how do you get the ""Haves"" on board with the ""Have-nots?""
A. CUOMO: Look, you have a moment here. I say in nine - first you need a process. I say in nine months, every local government with every Police Department, 500 in New York, sit at the table, give me a plan in nine months, as a collaborative.
C. CUOMO: Or else?
A. CUOMO: The - or else, you get no funding from the State, which is a big ""Or else.""
C. CUOMO: Yes, big ""None."" OK. A. CUOMO: So, they're going to have to do it. And then I say, ""Don't just give me a plan. You have to pass it into law, which means you have to go pass the legislative body in that local government.""
And with all, the energy, Chris, that is now generated, all that community activism, all those protesters, within nine months that energy is still going to be there.
And I want to see a legislature, in any local government, pass a new plan, redesigning their Police Department, if the community activists and that energy isn't part of the process and isn't satisfied. It's not going to happen.
C. CUOMO: Me having you on the show is an unusual thing. We've never really done it. But this was an unusual time. And they were unusual needs. And you stepped up in an unusual way that really was created by a vacuum of power on the Federal level.
And you're not the only one. There are other governors. And you've been very good and collaborative with Hogan down in Maryland, and Whitmer, and DeWine, and the ones up in the Northeast region. But these unusual times have demonstrated some unusual characteristics in people.
And, of course, I won't always be able to keep having you on this show. It'll never be seen as fair in people's eyes. And we both get that. And that's OK. You've got plenty of people to talk to.
But I want you to know that, you know, June is a big month for us, right? We got Mom and Pop's anniversary on the 5th. We got Pop's birthday on the 15th.
And this is what he always wanted. He was proud when you became Governor, because of what he'd know - he knew you'd do. Remember that whole talk he gave us about, ""I'm not pride - proud. I don't believe in pride. Pride is deadly sin, and blah all that.""
What he wanted to see is what you do with the opportunity. And everything, that he ever said matter to him, about public service, is what you demonstrated right here, and right now, during this period, when your State needed it most. And I hear it all the time.
Not everybody likes you. Not everybody likes me. Everybody seems to like Pop now. That's the benefit of being out for a while and maybe gone.
I just hope you recognize what even I'm able to recognize, being spawned from the same wolf pack. I hope you are able to appreciate what you did in your State, and what it means for the rest of the country now, and what it will always mean to those who love and care about you the most.
I'm wowed by what you did. And, more importantly, I'm wowed by how you did it. This was very hard. I know it's not over. But obviously, I love you as a brother. Obviously, I'll never be objective. Obviously, I think you're the best politician in the country. But I hope you feel good about what you did for your people because I know they appreciate it. Nothing's perfect. You'll have your critics.
A. CUOMO: Thank you.
C. CUOMO: But I've never seen anything like what you did.
A. CUOMO: Thank you.
C. CUOMO: And that's why I'm so happy to have had you on the show. And I hope you know that.
A. CUOMO: Yes. Look, we're not very - we're not big on sweet talk. But what Dad was all about was making a difference.
C. CUOMO: That was pretty sweet.
A. CUOMO: That was sweet.
C. CUOMO: You made a difference.
A. CUOMO: I wonder who wrote it.
What Dad was - what Dad was all about - well you just stole my line.
What Dad was all about was making a difference. And he would say, ""Who cares what they say,"" right? He lost his last election. People forget that. ""Who cares what they say? It's what you know. It's what you did is right.""
[21:30:00]
What I did here was right. And whatever, you know, was a political no- win, as you said from day one, you have people on both sides, and you couldn't make anybody happy, so you just do what's right.
I did what was right. I'm comfortable with what I did. I think the facts bear it out. I think the numbers bear it out. I think we saved tens of thousands of lives. But I did what was right.
And you do what is right. You tell the truth. You get up every night, and you tell the truth, whether they like it or not. This is the truth the way you see it. And that's all you can do.
So, I hope he'd be proud of me. He talked to me a lot through this, by the way. A 111 days, I did a briefing every day. I couldn't sleep at night. I'd close my eyes, and I would say, ""What would Pop say?"" And he spoke to me. And he helped me tremendously to get through it.
But what you do is the same thing. You're doing the right thing. And that's all we can do. Love you. Go to work.
C. CUOMO: I love you very much. I appreciate you being on. I'll see you soon.
A. CUOMO: Thank you, brother, same. C. CUOMO: Unusual times, right? He's my big brother. I love him. Of course, I'm not objective. But let's call it straight. Look at the State. Look at the numbers. Look at New Jersey. Look at Connecticut. Look how they came together.
Yes, he's my brother. That's - there's no question. I could cry about it in a second. But the results are there for all to see. Was it perfect? No. You tell me what is. But look at the state our country is in.
And if you don't think this is going to be reflected in what happens in November, then you haven't been paying attention. We got new poll numbers for you.
And this isn't about President Trump being worried or not. This is about the state of what this country is demanding, OK? There are people who are going to be worried on the Republican side. Polls are just a snapshot of a moment in time.
But let's see where we are right now, next.

C. CUOMO: You know, look, I mean, polls are a snapshot of a moment in time. They're just a suggestion. Trends are relevant, looking at specific States, relevant. But also, how they're playing within the parties will manifest in message, so that matters.
And, to that point, several high profile Republican Senators are acknowledging that they feel the same way they're seeing in the polls right now about Trump's reelection campaign. As Lindsey Graham put it, ""It's been a bad couple of weeks.""
New evidence from key Midwestern States, remember, States, not just national popularity, because it's about the Electoral College, Joe Biden, former VP, leading Trump by 8 in Wisconsin, up from 3 last month. Ohio, numbers are tight. Well within the MOE, the margin of error, Biden leading.
Important, why? Because Trump beat Clinton by 8 points there.
Florida, they're going to be in the election also. They're going to be big, right? COVID, it's not just a bad weeks. A couple - that's Senator Graham trying to play it down, because he's all about being nice to Trump. We'll see what happens if Trump loses, what song he'll sing then.
But it's not a couple of bad weeks. It's ignoring a pandemic, and having so many lives lost, where it didn't need to happen. It's about ignoring a mass movement in this country, the lives of with I haven't seen in my lifetime. I wasn't alive in the 60s. He's ignored them both.
Now, Florida is going to be in the spotlight. Their cases are popping all over the place. It's being ignored there.
Miami's Mayor is here. He knows this is serious. You know why? He's like me. He's a survivor. Let's talk about the reality, next.

(END VIDEO CLIP)
C. CUOMO: You're going to hear the Governor of Florida, who refuses to come on this show, along with all the other highly-elected officials, at the State level. They're going to mitigate what's happening in Florida. ""We have our ups. We have our downs.""
They're not telling you the truth. There's a new record-breaking single-day high in COVID cases in Florida, more than 5,500, about 1,500 more than the record they set last week.
Hospitalizations are up. ICU visits are up. Ventilations are all up in the past two weeks in the most populous county, Miami-Dade. But the Governor says he's not going to order mask wearing.
You tell me this isn't about stupid politics. You tell me this isn't about DeSantis being an acolyte of Trump. He won't come on and make the case. What does that tell you?
Miami Mayor Francis Suarez announced a City-wide mask mandate this week. He knows what the virus is like all too well.
You're looking well, though, Mayor. Welcome back to PRIME TIME.
MAYOR FRANCIS SUAREZ, (R) MIAMI, FLORIDA: Thank you so much, Chris. I really appreciate it. C. CUOMO: And I know you and I are still figuring out why we're not completely right, and that there's going to be a story to tell with this virus that you and I are trying to figure out ourselves. We'll put that into the future for some conversation someday.
Right now, the Governor says--
SUAREZ: Sure.
C. CUOMO: --""Well, you know, masks, tough to enforce, and, you know, it'd take a lot of resources, and that may not be the best use of resources."" All the experts are saying masks are the best use of resources.
Your take?
SUAREZ: We implemented a mask rule in public this week because, like you said, we saw, you know, a record number of cases the last few days in Miami-Dade County.
And, to put the numbers in context, when we ordered a stay-at-home - we put into effect a stay-at-home order, the high watermark was 533 cases, while we had two days, this week, where we had 900 cases, which is, you know, twice the high watermark in late March, when we - when we issued a stay-at-home order, which we knew was incredibly effective.
If we don't want to go backwards, the only option that we have right now is to order masks in public.
And, in fact, tomorrow, we're going to be asking the City Commission, by emergency ordinance, to implement a civil fine if you're not wearing the mask in public, which will be a fine of up to $250 for failure to follow the law.
C. CUOMO: You know, look, you're a Republican. You're doing right by your community. Period! I shouldn't even have mentioned the first part. The ""R"" is irrelevant.
But it does seem that we are seeing politics be played here by your Governor and other Republican Governors. You have not seen a Democratic Governor take the same posture that you've seen of someone like Governor DeSantis, and it has a familiar echo to the President.
Are you worried that your Governor is playing politics?
SUAREZ: Look, this is an issue where it's an apolitical issue. It's an issue that's got to be driven by the epidemiologists. We have biostatisticians. We do confer with Department of Health at least once a week, every Monday.
And after we have those conversations, after we look at the numbers, after we look at the trends, that's when we make decisions.
And it was after this week's Monday meeting with - by the way, 15 mayors joined me in, you know, in having a press conference, where many of those cities also joined the City of Miami, in implementing a mask-in-public rule.
[21:45:00]
We owe it to our residents, as your brother said, to be transparent with them. And we owe it to our residents to give them the best options that we have available, to try to stem the tide of, you know, of spread of COVID in our community.
And as you also said accurately, you know, in Miami-Dade County, hospitalizations are up. Ventilators are up. ICUs are up. Thankfully, deaths are not up. But we know that deaths are a lagging statistic that sometimes lag four weeks to five weeks after a spike in cases.
We're also hopeful that because it seems like a majority of the increase in cases is in 18-35 year-old range, we're hoping that that's not something that bleeds into the older population, which is of course more vulnerable and more likely--
C. CUOMO: Yes. That's - I'm with you on that.
(CROSSTALK)
C. CUOMO: You know, we had these girls on - ""Girls!""
We had these women on, young women, who were in Jacksonville. And they had gone out, you know. Again, the Governor and the messaging was, ""You don't really need a mask. You're going to be OK."" They go out. All 16 of them get COVID and seven of the people who were working in the bar.
The concern with the younger people is you're right that they're not getting as sick, and many can actually be asymptomatic. But they are more likely to spread it to people who don't handle it as well. And then you have a real problem.
What's your message to people tonight?
SUAREZ: My message to them is to follow the rules, to please, please do everything you can to wear masks in public in the City of Miami.
You know, it is difficult to police. There's no doubt about it. It's going to, you know, just like it was difficult to police, when we had a stay-at-home order, we weren't literally able to knock on every single door to make sure that people were at home.
But the reason why we put these recommendations in place is for our own safety and for the safety of others.
So, my recommendation and my message is to please wear a mask, when you're in public, so that we can do everything that we can to make sure that we reverse these numbers, and go from a situation where we've had record numbers, to getting things back under control, and continuing to hopefully open our economy safely.
C. CUOMO: Mr. Mayor, you are always offered a platform on this show, not just because you're a Republican, and I need voices from both sides, not just because we are ""COVID Cousins,"" because we both lived through it, but because you have been straight about what's going on in your community, and you have not dealt with the politics at all.
And I respect that. And I'm sure your community does as well. I don't usually have better-looking men on the show, which is why I like having Andrew on. But, in your case, I have to make an exception.
SUAREZ: Thanks, Chris.
C. CUOMO: Mayor Francis Suarez, God bless. The best to you and the family.
SUAREZ: Bless you.
C. CUOMO: All right, ahead, we have news in a case that we've been following very closely, the Ahmaud Arbery murder investigation in Georgia.
Of course, George Floyd matters. Of course Rayshard Brooks matters. They all matter. We forget the names, there are so many of these cases.
But in the new indictments, there is a step that's been taken by a community that is rare, and they reveal things that we must review, next.

C. CUOMO: It took a Grand Jury less than 10 minutes to indict the three men charged with killing Ahmaud Arbery.
The young man has been gone for more than four months. But remember, it took months for them to do a damn thing in that case, and it only happened because of the video that got put out. Four separate prosecutors went through this case before we got to here.
Let's take it up in Cuomo's Court with Laura Coates.
Counselor, good to have you back.
The time is going to work both ways, 10 minutes.
""Whoo! Damming facts! Strong case!""
""Nope! Bias jury! Too much media exposure! Can't be fair!""
How do you play it?
LAURA COATES, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR, SIRIUSXM HOST, ""THE LAURA COATES SHOW"", FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT: Well, first of all, the idea that it took many months for us even to get to this point.
And it wasn't simply because COVID-19 delayed the impaneling of Grand Juries. It was because of a deliberate decision, on behalf of the original prosecutors, to say ""No. We're not going to pursue these charges.""
So, the idea that being a matter of bias is almost laughable when one of the very people, who is a defendant, now charged with these crimes, is the one who provided the videotape footage that shows what happened to the 25 year-old jogging man, Ahmaud Arbery.
And so, yes, you will have this issue when it comes to trial, Chris, about whether or not you're going to find a jury that can be unbiased, that has never heard of this case, fat chance of that happening. However, it does necessarily say they cannot be objective about the evidence they're actually seeing.
And at this very early stage, as you well know, we're talking about enough to - for probable cause in an indictment. They still have to prove the case with actual evidence that can go in and come into trial.
C. CUOMO: The - right. And that's going to - the ""Beyond reasonable doubt"" is the highest standard that we have. We'll see if they have the proof to know by what they show.
Now, I don't know if you could tell how slick I was. But I was looking up the definition of malice murder in Georgia, while you were finishing your answer.
Malice murder versus felony murder, OK, as you have explained very well, before on this show, felony murder is a specific list of grave felonies that during the course of that felony, someone dies.
Now, they also charged malice murder, which I saw as being the same as just intentional murder. But there is one line that I think you'll find interesting, Counselor.
Malice is implied when no considerable provocation appears, which is a nod by the prosecutor that don't even try to argue justification, and two, where all the circumstances of the killing show an abandoned and malignant heart.
Even if it does line up statutorily as intentional murder, boy, will those words speak loud to the community! COATES: They absolutely will. And it's a - it is a signal that don't try the self-defense claim, when you are talking about why there was a struggle that ensued.
Remember, one of the things that came out the preliminary hearing was that Mr. Ahmaud Arbery ran until he couldn't run anymore, and then chose to fight.
He was pursued by cars that were used in an offensive manner, according to the indictments as well. He was trapped. He was falsely imprisoned with no legal authority to do so.
[21:55:00]
We're not talking about in a long list of cases where police officers are the subject of ire for their excessive force. We're talking about civilians here who have no, even colorable law, or colorable claim that they are acting under law. And so, you absolutely have the set- up.
But remember, the main difference between the two, a felony murder, and of course, malice is what your intent was. You don't have to have the intent for anyone to die in felony murder.
As long as you were doing something that was the wrong thing, in a felony, and just because somebody died during it, you're still accountable for their death. It's the same degree.
But the idea of intent here is what people are going to hang their hat on. They're going to say to themselves, Chris, ""Hold on. I think a bad intent, I think premeditated murder. I think about hiring a hit man. I think about a long period of time that has to take place to develop this intent,"" when in reality, it can form in almost an instant.
It need not be something that takes a very long period of time. And they may have more than enough evidence now to suggest that it happened quickly that it was an intentional act in addition to the other charges.
C. CUOMO: And they don't have to prove motive for malice murder. It sounds like hate crime or biased crime statutory language. But it isn't. They just have to prove that you had the intent in that moment.
Look, we will watch the prosecution. But the story you and I are going to tell, my friend, is going to be the story of what these men thought they knew about Arbery and why they thought they knew it. That is what is going to be part of the bigger narrative of what must change in this country.
Laura Coates, I love you. Thank you for being back.
COATES: Love you too, Chris. Thank you.
C. CUOMO: We'll be right back.

37,/content/Bias_Crime_Lexis_1.DOCX,Newstex Blogs,2020-07-27,1236 words,,NRAHQ,,NRA-ILA: This is What Keeps America Free,False,"Jul 27, 2020( AmmoLand.com: http://www.ammoland.com/ Delivered by Newstex) U.S.A. -(AmmoLand.com[1])- In response to a public expression of lawful political speech, 'safety officers' come to the person's home at midnight to interrogate him. He is accused of intimidation, making threats, hate crimes, and disorderly conduct. He is found guilty and his punishment includes exclusion from the community, suspension of his academic privileges, a ban on taking leadership roles in campus organizations, mandatory meetings with appropriate officials to learn about correct ways of thinking and speaking, and the presentation of a formal written apology, to be submitted in draft form 'for approval.' Readers would be excused for assuming that this occurred in some backward, repressive dictatorship or totalitarian regime, but these troubling events took place at an American University. 
 Austin Tong, a senior at Fordham University in New York State, posted two messages on his Instagram account. The first, on June 3, was a comment[2]about the 'nonchalant societal reaction' to the killing of David Dorn, a black, retired St. Louis Police officer. His second post, a day later, was a photo of himself holding his lawfully owned AR-15 rifle at his off-campus home. This was captioned, 'Don't tread on me,' followed by the emojis of the American and Communist Chinese flags and ahashtag[3]'commonly used by Chinese citizens to avoid censorship of online discussion of the Tiananmen Square massacre.' Mr. Tong is a Chinese-American who arrived in the United States as a six-year-old immigrant. He explained[4]that his second post was made to commemorate the 31st anniversary of the suppressed 1989 Chinese Democracy Movement.According to Mr. Tong, the university[5]'sent safety officers at midnight to interrogate me all over a simple picture of a lawfully owned gun.'Keith Eldredge, Fordham University's Dean of Students and Assistant Vice President, followed up byadvising[6]that he was initiating an investigation for bias/hate crimes, threats/intimidation, and disorderly conduct, based on these 'posts on social media related to the current racial issues in the country and political issues in China, including one in which you were holding an automatic weapon.' Fordham University - a private educational institution that is not bound by the First Amendment - nonetheless professes its commitment to free speech and expressive rights. For example, its mission statement[7]'guarantees the freedom of inquiry required by rigorous thinking and the quest for truth.' The university's Demonstration Policy[8]opens with the following: 'By its very nature, the University is a place where ideas and opinions are formulated and exchanged. Each member of the University has a right to freely express their positions and to work for their acceptance whether they assent to or dissent from existing situations in the University or society.' Similarly, Fordham's policy on 'Bias-Related Incidents and/or Hate Crimes[9]' claims the University: Values freedom of expression and the open exchange of ideas. The expression of controversial ideas and differing views is a vital part of University discourse. Although the expression of an idea or point of view may be offensive or inflammatory to others, it may not constitute a hate crime or bias-related incident. While this value of openness protects the expression of controversial ideas, it does not protect or condone harassment or expressions of bias or hate aimed at individuals or groups that violate the Student Code of Conduct. Regardless of these high-minded affirmations, the University concluded that Mr. Tong's posts - devoid of threats, violence, intimidation, coercion, or harassment - violated the university rules on 'Bias and/or Hate Crimes' and 'Threats/Intimidation.' A July 14 2020 letter[10]from Keith Eldredge (copied to the 'Department of Public Safety') outlined the sanctions. Mr. Tong would be barred from the campus for the duration of his degree program. He was banned from representing the university or running for any student office or position. He would be required to attend instruction and complete activities on 'implicit bias,' including a meeting with staff of the 'multicultural affairs' office. He would have to submit a mandatory 'apology letter,' to be approved by the university and a failure to comply would result in the university suspending or expelling him. Perversely, the social media backlash to these innocuous posts has itself resulted in threats, intimidation, and potential bias/hate crimes against Austin Tong. It will be interesting to see whether Fordham University will enforce the same rules and policies against the activists from the university that 'flooded the comments section' of his posts.In the same way that the 'quest for truth' supported characterizing his firearm indiscriminately as an 'automatic weapon,' the university's commitments to 'freedom of expression and the open exchange of ideas' protected Austin Tong,who was[11]'forcibly silenced, faced verbal and assaulting harassment from mobs, and subjected to Soviet-style interrogation and punishment.' Despite this, and the possibility that his academic career will be marred indefinitely due to these disciplinary actions, he has been steadfast in his defense of his constitutional rights. In a video for the NRA, Austin Tong describes his decision to purchase a gun, adding that '[h]ere in America, we have our right to keep and bear arms. This is what keeps America free.' Actually, Austin, it is patriots like you - who fight to protect our constitutional freedoms - that keep America free.

–Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
I used to be a faithful supporter of the Policeman Benevolent Association. For just a $25 contribution, the local PBA would issue a decal with a badge–like insignia that you could affix to the driver's side backdoor window. It signaled that you were a “tax paying citizen,” employed, and on the right side of the law. As a young black man, I suspected at the time that the decal also signaled that I had connections, through family or friends, to law enforcement. Which I did. My father was a parole officer in the South Bronx, and I grew up with respect for the law and the people who enforced it. But that's not why I made a point of supporting the PBA.
Getting a decal served as a talisman, distinguishing me, hopefully, from other black men that the police would pull over, providing me with some measure of protection from potential abuse. I made my first donation to the PBA when I moved to the suburbs of Yonkers in my late twenties. I continued payments into my thirties, when I joined the faculty at Yale University in New Haven, and then into my forties, when I crossed coasts to join to faculty at the University of California, Davis. Although I've been stopped dozens of times over the years, often without any clear reason, I've never been roughed up or bullied by the police. Some of my friends have not been so lucky. Back in 1995, the year I defended my doctoral dissertation, Earl G. Graves Jr.—my basketball buddy and the senior vice president for advertising and marketing at Black Enterprise magazine—was shaken down at New York's Penn Station. Dressed in full business attire, holding an orange juice in his hand, and stepping off a Metro–North train on an early workday morning, Graves somehow aroused the suspicions of the police. The New York Times reported that Graves was accosted and quickly hustled to a nearby wall by two Metro–North police officers as they “…lifted my arms in the air, relieved me of my briefcase and frisked me from top to bottom.”
Growing up black in the city, you had to learn to circumvent unwelcoming (and often white) neighborhoods as well as crooked beat cops in your own neighborhood, some of whom who took their “license to kill” personally. Yet as a cocky teenager from Harlem, I used to feel like the entire city was my playground. In my mid–teens, many a time my Cuban–Jewish running mate and I stumbled into the wrong bar, down the wrong street, or through the wrong neighborhoods:
Howard Beach, East 68th Street, Whitestone, Alphabet City—only to be escorted or chased out by local teens. I learned firsthand how New York's white neighborhoods stayed white.
Displays of hypermasculinity by white men were frequently expressed through neighborhood vigilant–like behavior, which was not only considered normal, but it was justified (Cazenave 2018). Eventually, I had the chance to observe this phenomenon from the safety of a courthouse. After I graduated from college, I began working as a researcher for Jay Schulman, an applied sociologist, and the founder of the National Jury Project. It was 1986, and I was helping him to select juries for the Howard Beach case. Racial tensions were high; just two years earlier an elderly and disabled black woman named Eleanor Bumpurs had been shot and killed by police officers who had shown up at her public–housing project in the Bronx to enforce an eviction. But Howard Beach was different: it was a working–class Archie Bunker–like neighborhood in Queens, New York, a neighborhood that three black men stumbled into and that has forever become linked in the public imagination with vigilante justice by white teens. A mob of white teens, armed with baseball bats, a tire iron, and a tree limb attacked the three men. One of the victims, 23–year–old Trinidadian–born Michael Griffith, was chased onto the Belt Parkway where he was run over by a speeding car. One of his companions escaped but a second was brutally pummeled with weapons (Haynes and Solovitch 2017, 162–163). According to news reports and court documents, Justice Thomas A. Demakos sentenced 17–year old British immigrant Jon Lester for Griffith's murder, declaring that Lester showed “no remorse, no sense of guilt, no shame, no fear,”…“What kind of individual do I have before me, who, after witnessing a young black man get crushed by a car, continues his reckless conduct by savagely beating another black male with a bat (Fried 1988).” Most of the defendants in the case were ultimately acquitted of manslaughter.
Three years after the Howard Beach case, I helped select the jury for another white vigilante murder trial. This time, the victim—Yusef Hawkins—was 16. Yusef and his friends had taken the train to the Italian–American working–class community of Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, to look at a used car advertised for sale. They were surrounded and taunted by a mob of white youth, and Yusef was shot twice in the chest. People said that “hate” had killed him, but it was a broader system of institutional racism that set the wheel in motion (Carmichael and Hamilton 1967; Feagin 2006). Acts of “vigilante justice” are nothing more than justified systemic violence that has been central in controlling white spaces (Anderson 1990; Cazenave 2018, 81).
The 2012 murder of 17–year–old Trayvon Martin by vigilante George Zimmerman typifies the ways in which defended neighborhoods work. Trayvon had been visiting his father at his mostly–white gated community in Sanford, Florida. He walked to the nearby 7–Eleven and purchased a bag of Skittles and an Arizona Iced Tea. Strolling back home, Trayvon drew the attention of George Zimmerman, the neighborhood–watch captain who had been patrolling the neighborhood. After calling 911, according to Reuters, Zimmerman reported a “real suspicious guy,” and followed him, accosted him, and ultimately shot him. He was acquitted as the jury believed his claim of self–defense.
Racial violence characterized the creation of white spaces long before local and federal governments engaged in zoning and redlining practices. There is a critical connection between racial violence, residential segregation, and the construction of racial–group interests and antagonisms; they all work to legitimate racial categorization as objective and natural (Haynes 2006, 53). Whiteness itself has been an instituted privilege. From the outset, capitalist interests and slavery have been in direct tension with, and in opposition to, democracy. Whiteness secured power and wealth, evolving from its roots in racial identity into a form of property that is protected by law. Whiteness is a right that is both historically and contemporaneously protected in American law and has been crucial to the accumulation of wealth for a unified white nation (Harris 1995; Baptist). Race categories are bounded (black/white, citizen/non–citizen) and durable because these categories make up a socially organized and enforced system of distinction (Tilly 1999, 4–5). We use race as a “social difference codes”…“that define the socially significant distinctions” between people, on which society is structured, social inequality ordered, and to which people develop feelings of belonging and these differences define the socially salient categories and cultural schema for enacting social relationships (Ridgeway 2000, 1–3).
The designation of racial categories by the State and its agents reinforced the significance of race differences in politics and in civic life. The U.S. Constitution legalized the importation of slaves until 1808 and introduced a Fugitive Slave Clause (Article IV, Section 2, Clause 3), which required escaped slaves to be treated hunted down like criminal fugitives to protect the property interests of white slave holders. In fact, scholars have located the roots of policing in the slave patrols that emerged.
But it was the Dred Scott Decision in 1857 that established second–class status for black people for generations. Chief Justice Taney not only conveyed that both free and unfree black people were not citizens, he also indicted the entire “race” as “beings of inferior order, and altogether unfit to associate with the white race, either in social or political relations.” The decision reflected the widespread agreement among whites that Negroes were categorically different from other races (Jaspin 2007, 15–23, 31). Following the end of Reconstruction, Black life was criminalized by the adoption of Black Codes instituted across the South that disenfranchised Black civic and political life. Poll Taxes and Grandfather clauses completed the disenfranchisement of the Black vote, virtually guaranteeing second–class citizenship while the formation of a rigid color line ensured white hegemony (Downs 2015). Those defined as “white” drew closure, fiercely protective of the spaces that marked their inclusion.
Between the 1890 and 1940, with “segregation” becoming a political rallying cry north and south, thousands of white Americans engaged in systemic mob violence, even resorting to firebombing to banish blacks from their towns (Jaspin 2007; Nightingale 2012, 318; Loewen 2018, 23). This legacy of racial cleansing in America created what some have termed “Sundown Towns”—because of the signs posted on their outskirts that read “Nigger, Don't Let the Sun Go Down on You in …”—legal ordinances and violence transformed nearly half of the counties in the nation into all–white spaces (Loewen 2018, 422). All–white “defended neighborhoods” have for the longest time engaged in civic and police violence to keep white spaces white (Anderson 1992). In Sundown Towns: A Hidden Dimension of American Racism, sociologist James W. Loewen identifies 184 towns, across 32 states, where “sundown” signs were openly displayed for newcomers (Loewen 2018, 104). Villages, towns, and counties also banned Chinese, Mexicans, and Native Americans, and at times, Jews, Catholics, and Mormons (Loewen 2018, vi). There are 153 documented anti–Chinese riots that occurred across the West before the turn–of–the twentieth century. By 1875, Congress had banned Chinese women from entering the United States and in 1882, Asian immigration was restricted altogether by the “Chinese Exclusion” Act.
Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) legitimated Jim Crow segregation as well as the quantification of racial membership under the premises of ‘separate but equal’. Segregation invested race categories with “content and meaning” and political substance, while fostering a collective “white” conscience that allowed millions of southern and eastern European immigrants who arrived in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to be embraced (Roediger 2007, 8–9; Loewen 2018, 99). In tandem with the violence and segregation, the criminal justice system contributed to the widely–held public perception that blacks were pre–modern, savage, and prone to criminality. This perception then bolstered efforts to drive Negroes and other non–whites out of villages and rural parts of the nation toward towns and cities (Muhammad 2019, 9; Haynes 2018, 38; Baptist 2014).
In his opus work, Economy and Society Max Weber recognized the intertwined relationship between the boundaries created by racial classification and political economy. Weber asserted that “nobility” is a social good, and that, in the post–Emancipation era, racial group boundaries were solidified as a way to monopolize honor and social power (Weber 1968, 386: Haynes and Hernandez 2008, 54). The participation of poor white Americans was critical to this project. In the post–Reconstruction South, the social honor of poor whites, which Weber termed “ethnic honor” was dependent upon the social declassification of blacks, that is, their stigmatization (Goffman 1986; Weber 1968, 391).
By the turn of the twentieth century, Chinatowns and African American ghettos were beginning to emerge in cities across the American landscape. The black migration towards cities and the north was observed by Atlanta School scholar George Edmund Haynes, who observed that between 1860 and 1870, the Negro population increased by 51 percent in eight Northern cities (including New York City). Between 1890 and 1900, the population of Negroes in towns and cities with at least 2500 inhabitants increased nearly one–third faster than did those in rural districts (Haynes 1913, 113). Prior to the Great Migration, crowding in segregated areas already characterized black communities north and south: According to George Haynes, “New York has its ‘San Juan Hill’ in the West Sixties, and its Harlem district of over 35,000 within about eighteen city blocks; Philadelphia has its Seventh Ward; Chicago has its State Street; Washington its North West neighborhood, and Baltimore its Druid Hill Avenue. Louisville has its Chestnut Street and its ‘Smoketown;’ Atlanta its West End and Auburn Avenue” (Haynes 113, 109).
Local police and sheriffs played a central role in maintaining white spaces and protecting the interests of homeowners (Loewen 2018, 92). But a fervent white citizenry often took the law into their own hands, meting out justice for crossing racially defined boundaries. Between 1865 and 1950, at least 6,500 blacks were lynched in the United States (https://eji.org/reports/reconstruction-in-america-overview/). Racial terror often occurred under the cover of night, when forty–foot high crosses were lit by hooded Knight Riders of the Klu Klux Klan. By the early 1920s, the Klan boasted tens of thousands of new members, from all corners of the United States. The town of Visalia, California in the central San Joaquin Valley, had become a Klan stronghold (Bringhurst 2000, 365).
Beginning in the late nineteenth century, the movement from the rural South to the urban North was part of a broader shift, among both whites and blacks, from agriculture toward the new industrial economies; for blacks, however, there was another factor: they were fleeing anti–Negro terrorism (Haynes and Solovitch 2017, 30–31). Cities promised refuge, a semblance of independence and autonomy, or at least a certain level of safety in numbers. Those numbers allowed for amassing political power and exerting some local control in neighborhoods. Yet many black newcomers found that they had traded one set of barriers for another. White–on–black violence enforced a monopoly within markets and created the boundaries for a formally segregated housing market that distributed resources, allocated goods, and organized the residential community (Haynes 2006, 64; Haynes and Hernandez 2008, 65; Gotham 2000; Haynes 2018, 41).
Decades before restrictive covenants were instituted by the Federal Housing Authority, and white neighborhoods were marked as desirable for investment while Mexican and Black neighborhoods were “redlined” as undesirable, segregation had already neared completion through official and unofficial forms of white–vigilantism (Weaver 1948; Gotham 2000). Violence against blacks transformed black spaces into newly “all–white” spaces (Loewen 2018).1
The bloodiest period of our nation's racial history occurred in the decade surrounding World War I, as a series of pogroms erupted throughout the North and Midwest. Following the end of World War One, white GI's returned home to discover Negro veterans developing a new–found pride in being American. White men again took to the streets to vent their rage, and Negro soldiers just home from Europe were lynched, some still wearing their uniforms (Haynes and Solovitch 2017, 41). The Red Summer of 1919 was particularly noted for its extreme dehumanizing violence against Black families, and it occurred in the middle of a flu pandemic that would kill at least 50 million worldwide, according to the CDC estimates.
In 1921, with fear of the flu subsiding, the thriving business district of Greenwood in Tulsa, Oklahoma, was targeted for destruction by white mobs. These pogroms were becoming common in America; a cursory scan of headlines from the New York Times historical index reveals cities and towns throughout the North, South, and Midwest: Waverly, Ohio (1884); Wilmington, North Carolina (1898); Lonoke, Arkansas (1898); New Orleans, Louisiana (1900); New York City's San Juan Hill and Tenderloin districts (1900 and 1905); Evansville, Indiana (1903); Atlanta, Georgia (1906), and Springfield,(1908) and Chicago (1911), Illinois.
State classification by race creates what Bourdieu calls “the structure of the mind,” relegating blackness to a “spoiled identity”—a signifier of morally deficiency and dishonor (Goffman 1986). It continues to sanction state–sponsored violence against blacks as well as impunity for police officers. It is rooted in societal institutions and structures and nourished through all the privileges that come with white skin. It is stamped on our nation's character and embedded in its founding documents, which reduced blacks to body parts (Muhammad 2019; Mills et al. 2018, 17). In order to boost representation among slave–holding states in the House of Representatives, blacks were counted as three–fifths of a person (Baptist 2014, 9). Four of the first five U.S. Presidents owned blacks (Baptist 2014, 9).
As we entered the Civil War, the continuance of these relationships made cotton king—with cotton accounting for more than half of U.S. exports—and whites wealthy. And the violent policing of black bodies was a crucial linchpin to protecting the capitalist interests and political power of white men. This white patriarchal violence persists to this day as black men are up to 3.5 times more likely than whites to be killed by law enforcement. A 2014 ProPublica analysis of federal data tracked 1,217 deadly police shootings between 2010 and 2012 and showed that black teens between 15 and 19 years of age were killed at a rate of 21 times their white counterparts.
Many Americans said that they felt a tide had turned in America during the summer of 2014, following the deaths of Eric Garner (July 2014), Michael Brown (August 2014), and Tamir Rice (November 2014) and the crystallization of the mantra “Hands up! Don't Shoot” for the next stage of the Black Live Matter Movement (Cazenave 2018, 9). They said it again when we were “sheltering at home,” and we witnessed the slow–motioning homicide of George Floyd—eight minutes and 46 seconds of raw, uncut video, a black snuff film—galvanized the nation and drew multiracial support for criminal justice reform and an end to state–sponsored violence. Once labeled radicals and extremists, Black Lives Matter has become the nation's largest protest movement and heir apparent to the Black Freedom struggle. Recent surveys show a majority of registered voters support BLM (Taylor 2016).
Is there something different about this moment? For months now, “Say their names” has been chanted by young whites across the nation. And in my small town in Davis, California, I have observed children as young as seven writing out the names, in chalk on the sidewalks and on signs sprawled across town the names of those memorialized: Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, Lavern Cox, Ahmaud Arbery, Marsha Johnson, Sandra Bland, Trayvon Martin. As much as I am heartened by these signs, I fear we may be reliving the nadir of American racial history. The racial conversation today looks not dissimilar from that of 1920. Both periods saw the growth of intolerance towards new immigrants. In both eras, official and unofficial forms of violence targeted Blacks, and other non–whites. Both periods saw a growth in anti–Semitic violence. Both witnessed the increased prominence and mainstreaming of the Klu Klux Klan (1915) and the Alt–Right (2016), the growth of white nativism, and the racial pandering in politics. And both eras were marked by a crushing pandemic, in which marginalized, segregated communities were disproportionately impacted. And today, like yesteryear, the impact of the COVID–19 pandemic leaves Black folk still sick from freedom (Downs 2018).
Much rides on the coming elections in November. But even if progressive voices take back the White House, I suspect that even the most ambitious police reforms will have limited impact by themselves.
For the forseable future, Black folks will continue to live in the bleakest neighborhoods, with the worst schools, the fewest resources, and the scarcest of opportunities. Unless we are fully prepared to dismantle segregation in all of its forms—and until whites are truly prepared to lose the material advantages that come with segregation—we are destined for perhaps many more “moments” of solidarity and failed national reconciliation, but no disruptive break from our ignominious violent past.
Notes
1Today, research still shows that the impact of nonwhite in–migration on anti–black bias crimes and violent bias crime remains higher in neighborhoods with more white residents than in places with few white residents (Grattet 2009, 132).

Becerra Calls on Facebook to Step Up Action to Combat the Spread of Hate and Disinformation Online,False,"California Attorney General Xavier Becerra issued the following news release on Aug. 5:
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra today joined a multistate letter calling on Facebook to take additional steps to combat the spread of hate and disinformation on the social media platform. The coalition also urges the company to do more to provide assistance to people who fall victim to online intimidation and harassment, including digital abuse and violence.
""When Facebook profits off of hate, it is letting its platform be used to dehumanize and demean,"" said Attorney General Becerra. ""The spread of hate and disinformation on social media puts our democracy and decades of advocacy work by Black Americans, Latinos, the LGBTQ community, people with disabilities, and many others at risk. If Facebook truly wants to be a place that brings people together, it must do more -- Mark Zuckerberg must do more. We urge Facebook to take affirmative steps to join us in the fight to better tackle hate in our society and disinformation in our democracy. It will take all of us working together to make a difference.""
Although Facebook has committed to the public and its users that it will ""invest billions of dollars each year to keep [Facebook's] community safe and continuously work with outside experts to review and update [Facebook's] policies,"" the recent independent civil rights audit of the company's policies and practices reveals that the steps taken thus far have fallen short. Private parties, organized groups, and public officials continue to use Facebook to spread misinformation and project messages of hate against different groups of Americans. According to recent surveys, more than forty percent of Americans have experienced some form of online harassment, including criminal forms of harassment like cyberstalking, doxing, and swatting. Of those Americans who report having been harassed online, more than three-quarters have reported being harassed on Facebook. Much of that harassment is focused on characteristics protected by the civil rights laws that state attorneys general are charged with enforcing, including race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender and gender identity, and disability. Unfortunately, recourse is unavailable for too many of these victims due to limitations on the services that Facebook offers victims.
In the letter, the Attorneys General urge Facebook to:
* Aggressively enforce the company's policies against hate speech and organized hate organizations;
* Allow public, third-party audits of hate content and enforcement;
* Commit to an ongoing, independent analysis of the platform's content population scheme and the prompt development of best practices guidance;
* Expand policies limiting inflammatory advertisements that vilify minority groups;
* Offer live real-time assistance to help users address harassment before damage becomes irreversible;
* Make information about unlawful harassment and intimidation more readily available, within the bounds of privacy laws, to victims and law enforcement; and
* Strengthen filtering, reporting, and blocking tools.
Attorney General Becerra is committed to combatting hate wherever it occurs. Last month, the Attorney General published the latest report on hate crime in California, which includes data through 2019. In June, he released a video urging Californians to stand united against hate and report suspected hate crimes to their local law enforcement agency. In April, the Attorney General issued a bulletin to help ensure law enforcement agencies across California have the necessary information and tools to continue to respond to hate crime activity during COVID-19. More information on tools and resources to combat hate crime is available at https://oag.ca.gov/hatecrimes.
In sending the letter, Attorney General Becerra joins the attorneys general of the District of Columbia, Illinois, New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin.

Mark Zuckerberg, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Sheryl Sandberg, Chief Operating Officer, Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, California 94025
Dear Mr. Zuckerberg & Ms. Sandberg:
We, the undersigned State Attorneys General, write to request that you take additional steps to prevent Facebook from being used to spread disinformation and hate and to facilitate discrimination. We also ask that you take more steps to provide redress for users who fall victim to intimidation and harassment, including violence and digital abuse.
Our nation is in the midst of a reckoning on issues of racial justice and civil rights. As State Attorneys General, we have witnessed firsthand how the country's longstanding undercurrent of discrimination has burst into the open, as reports of hate crimes and bias incidents of all kinds have dramatically increased in recent years./1 And while recent events have further highlighted the systemic injustice that persists in our society, the last few months also have seen millions of Americans join together to call for action against bias and racism.
As you know, Facebook is not immune to these problems. Although Facebook has made some progress in counteracting the use of its platform to dehumanize and demean, that is just the beginning of what is necessary./2 Private parties, organized groups, and public officials continue to use Facebook to spread misinformation and project messages of hate against different groups of Americans. In many cases, these messages lead to intimidation and harassment of particular individuals online.
According to recent surveys, more than forty percent of Americans have experienced some form of online harassment, including cyberstalking, doxing (maliciously publishing someone's personal information), and swatting (filing false police reports to prompt a law enforcement response targeting the victim)./3 Of those Americans who report having been harassed online, more than three-quarters have reported being harassed on Facebook./4 Much of that harassment is focused on characteristics protected by the civil rights laws that many of us are charged with enforcing, including race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender and gender identity, and disability./5 Recourse is unavailable for too many of these victims, due to limitations on the services that Facebook offers victims and other impediments to securing relief through civil lawsuits or criminal prosecutions.
We understand that Facebook has committed to the public and its users that it will ""invest billions of dollars each year to keep [Facebook's] community safe and continuously work with outside experts to review and update [Facebook's] policies.""/6 But, as the most recent Civil Rights Audit reveals, the steps you have taken thus far have fallen short. With the vast resources at your disposal, we believe there is much more that you can do to prevent the use of Facebook as a vehicle for misinformation and discrimination, and to prevent your users from being victimized by harassment and intimidation on your platforms.
As State Attorneys General, we are responsible for protecting the safety and wellbeing of all the communities we serve. As part of that mission, we must constantly contend with the impacts of online hate, intimidation, and harassment. Many of our offices enforce the laws that protect our residents from bias offenses, intimidation, and harassment--whether online or on our streets./7 And many of our offices include units dedicated to serving the victims of unlawful conduct, including helping them access and use tools that allow them to vindicate their rights. As part of our responsibilities to our communities, Attorneys General have helped residents navigate Facebook's processes for victims to address abuse on its platform. While Facebook has--on occasion--taken action to address violations of its terms of service in cases where we have helped elevate our constituents' concerns,/8 we know that everyday users of Facebook can find the process slow, frustrating, and ineffective. Thus, we write to highlight positive steps that Facebook can take to strengthen its policies and practices. We hope to work with you to ensure that fewer individuals suffer online harassment and discrimination, and that it is quickly and effectively addressed when they do.
Based on our collective experience, we believe that Facebook should take additional actions including the following steps--many of which are highlighted in Facebook's recent Civil Rights Audit--to strengthen its commitment to civil rights and fighting disinformation and discrimination:
* Aggressively enforce Facebook policies against hate speech and organized hate organizations: Although Facebook has developed policies against hate speech and organizations that peddle it, we remain concerned that Facebook's policies on Dangerous Individuals and Organizations, including but not limited to its policies on white nationalist and white supremacist content, are not enforced quickly and comprehensively enough./9 Content that violates Facebook's own policies too often escapes removal just because it comes as coded language, rather than specific magic words. And even where Facebook takes steps to address a particular violation, it often fails to proactively address the follow-on actions by replacement or splinter groups that quickly emerge.
* Allow public, third-party audits of hate content and enforcement: To gauge the ongoing progress of Facebook's enforcement efforts, independent experts should be permitted access to the data necessary to conduct regular, transparent third-party audits of hate and hate-related misinformation on the platform, including any information made available to the Global Oversight Board. As part of this effort, Facebook should capture data on the prevalence of different forms of hate content on the platform, whether or not covered by Facebook's own community standards, thus allowing the public to determine whether enforcement of anti-hate policies differs based on the type of hate content at issue.
* Commit to an ongoing, independent analysis of Facebook's content population scheme and the prompt development of best practices guidance: By funneling users toward particular types of content, Facebook's content population scheme, including its algorithms, can push users into extremist online communities that feature divisive and inflammatory messages, often directed at particular groups. Although Facebook has conducted research and considered programs to reduce this risk, there is still no mandatory guidance for coders and other teams involved in content population. Facebook should commit to an ongoing, independent analysis of its content population scheme, including its algorithms, and also continuously implement mandatory protocols as best practices are identified to curb bias and prevent recommendations of hate content and groups.
* Expand policies limiting inflammatory advertisements that vilify minority groups: Although Facebook currently prohibits ads that claim that certain people, because of their membership in a protected group, pose a threat to the physical safety of communities or the nation, its policies still allow attacks that characterize such groups as threats to national culture or values.10 The current prohibition should be expanded to include such ads.
We also recommend the following measures to improve the supportive services that Facebook offers to users who have been or may become victims of harassment and intimidation on its platforms:
* Offer live real-time assistance: Facebook users can report intimidation and harassment but cannot immediately engage a Facebook employee who can promptly address issues that are occurring in real time. Victims of intimidation and harassment would benefit from more immediate access to Facebook employees who can offer prompt assistance. For example, if a user is being doxed, live assistance could help stop the spread of the user's personal information before the damage cannot be undone.
* Make information about harassment and intimidation more readily available: Facebook should facilitate evidence preservation and cooperate with victims and law enforcement agencies seeking evidence to prove a case of harassment or intimidation, such as cyberstalking or non-consensual distribution of intimate imagery, when the offenders use Facebook to perpetrate their crimes.
* Strengthen filtering, reporting, and blocking tools: Facebook allows users to block individual people, but users should have stronger tools and more choices for filtering out and reporting hateful, intimidating, and harassing content they do not want to see in their feeds. For example, if members of a Facebook group are engaged in an organized campaign of harassment against a single user, the victim should be able to block all members of the group and report batches of posts or users without having to block or report each individually.
We urge Facebook to take these steps to better tackle hate in our society, and address the interests of users who are victimized by others in the online community that Facebook has built.

Tong Calls on Facebook to Take Stronger Steps to Prevent Use of Its Platforms to Spread Hate and Disinformation,False,"Connecticut Attorney General William Tong issued the following news release on Aug. 5:
Attorney General William Tong today joined 19 attorneys general from across the United States in calling on Facebook to take additional steps to prevent their site from being used to spread hate and disinformation. The attorneys general also urged Facebook to provide stronger support for users who fall victim to online intimidation and harassment on its platforms.
In a letter today to Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, the attorneys general assert that despite its stated commitment to working to keep its user community safe, Facebook has fallen short in keeping hate content off its platforms and protecting users from online harassment.
The letter follows the release of a Civil Rights Audit of Facebook's practices -- commissioned by the company and completed in July--that faults Facebook for failing to advance civil rights, and refusing to enforce its own policies against dangerous organizations and individuals, including white supremacists and other extremists.
Recent surveys suggest more than 40 percent of Americans have experienced some form of online harassment, and that of those victims, more than 75 percent have reported being harassed on Facebook.
""Trolls, hate groups and foreign actors use Facebook as a weapon of choice to spread vile and racist disinformation. Facebook can and must do more to protect its users from hate speech, harassment and intimidation,"" said Attorney General Tong.
The reforms recommended in today's letter, many of which are highlighted in the recent Civil Rights Audit, include calls for Facebook to:
* Aggressively enforce its policies against hate speech and organized hate organizations;
* Allow public, third-party audits of hate content and enforcement;
* Commit to an ongoing, independent analysis of Facebook's content population scheme and the prompt development of best practices guidance; and
* Expand policies limiting inflammatory advertisements that vilify minority groups;
The Attorneys General also recommends steps to enhance Facebook supportive services including:
* Offer live real-time assistance to victims of intimidation and harassment;
* Make information about unlawful harassment and intimidation more readily available; and
* Strengthen filtering, reporting, and blocking tools.
In addition to Connecticut, attorneys general representing the following jurisdictions are participating in today's letter: California, District of Columbia, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, Vermont and Wisconsin. The letter was led by New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal, District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine, and Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul.

Facebook has repeatedly failed to protect users on its platform, and it must do more to stop people from becoming victims of harassment.""
In a letter today to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, Attorney General Stein and 19 attorneys general assert that Facebook has fallen short of its stated commitment to keeping users safe and in keeping hate content off its platforms. Recent surveys suggest more than 40 percent of Americans have experienced some form of online harassment, and of those victims, more than 75 percent have reported being harassed on Facebook. Much of the harassment reported by Facebook users focuses on characteristics protected by civil rights laws, including race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender and gender identity, and disability. Such harassment can include conduct like cyberstalking, doxing (maliciously publishing someone's personal information), and swatting (filing false police reports to prompt law enforcement response targeting the victim).
The letter follows the July release of a civil rights audit of Facebook's practices, commissioned by the company, that faults Facebook for failing to advance civil rights and refusing to enforce its own policies against dangerous organizations and individuals, including white supremacists and other extremists.
The attorneys general call for many reforms that were included in the audit and urge Facebook to:
* Aggressively enforce its policies against hate speech and organized hate organizations.
* Allow public, third-party audits of hate content and enforcement.
* Commit to an ongoing, independent analysis of Facebook's content population scheme and the prompt development of best practices guidance.
* Expand policies limiting inflammatory advertisements that vilify minority groups.
The attorneys general also recommend steps to enhance supportive services, including calling on Facebook to:
* Offer live real-time assistance to victims of intimidation and harassment.
* Make information about unlawful harassment and intimidation more readily available.
* Strengthen filtering, reporting, and blocking tools.
Attorney General Stein is joined in sending today's letter by the Attorneys General of California, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, Vermont, and Wisconsin.

To: Mark Zuckerberg, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Sheryl Sandberg, Chief Operating Officer, Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, California 94025
Dear Mr. Zuckerberg & Ms. Sandberg:
We, the undersigned State Attorneys General, write to request that you take additional steps to prevent Facebook from being used to spread disinformation and hate and to facilitate discrimination. We also ask that you take more steps to provide redress for users who fall victim to intimidation and harassment, including violence and digital abuse.
Our nation is in the midst of a reckoning on issues of racial justice and civil rights. As State Attorneys General, we have witnessed firsthand how the country's longstanding undercurrent of discrimination has burst into the open, as reports of hate crimes and bias incidents of all kinds have dramatically increased in recent years./1 And while recent events have further highlighted the systemic injustice that persists in our society, the last few months also have seen millions of Americans join together to call for action against bias and racism.
As you know, Facebook is not immune to these problems. Although Facebook has made some progress in counteracting the use of its platform to dehumanize and demean, that is just the beginning of what is necessary./2 Private parties, organized groups, and public officials continue to use Facebook to spread misinformation and project messages of hate against different groups of Americans. In many cases, these messages lead to intimidation and harassment of particular individuals online.
According to recent surveys, more than forty percent of Americans have experienced some form of online harassment, including cyberstalking, doxing (maliciously publishing someone's personal information), and swatting (filing false police reports to prompt a law enforcement response targeting the victim)./3 Of those Americans who report having been harassed online, more than three-quarters have reported being harassed on Facebook./4 Much of that harassment is focused on characteristics protected by the civil rights laws that many of us are charged with enforcing, including race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender and gender identity, and disability./5 Recourse is unavailable for too many of these victims, due to limitations on the services that Facebook offers victims and other impediments to securing relief through civil lawsuits or criminal prosecutions.
We understand that Facebook has committed to the public and its users that it will ""invest billions of dollars each year to keep [Facebook's] community safe and continuously work with outside experts to review and update [Facebook's] policies.""/6 But, as the most recent Civil Rights Audit reveals, the steps you have taken thus far have fallen short. With the vast resources at your disposal, we believe there is much more that you can do to prevent the use of Facebook as a vehicle for misinformation and discrimination, and to prevent your users from being victimized by harassment and intimidation on your platforms.
As State Attorneys General, we are responsible for protecting the safety and wellbeing of all the communities we serve. As part of that mission, we must constantly contend with the impacts of online hate, intimidation, and harassment. Many of our offices enforce the laws that protect our residents from bias offenses, intimidation, and harassment--whether online or on our streets./7 And many of our offices include units dedicated to serving the victims of unlawful conduct, including helping them access and use tools that allow them to vindicate their rights. As part of our responsibilities to our communities, Attorneys General have helped residents navigate Facebook's processes for victims to address abuse on its platform. While Facebook has--on occasion--taken action to address violations of its terms of service in cases where we have helped elevate our constituents' concerns,/8 we know that everyday users of Facebook can find the process slow, frustrating, and ineffective. Thus, we write to highlight positive steps that Facebook can take to strengthen its policies and practices. We hope to work with you to ensure that fewer individuals suffer online harassment and discrimination, and that it is quickly and effectively addressed when they do.
Based on our collective experience, we believe that Facebook should take additional actions including the following steps--many of which are highlighted in Facebook's recent Civil Rights Audit--to strengthen its commitment to civil rights and fighting disinformation and discrimination:
* Aggressively enforce Facebook policies against hate speech and organized hate organizations: Although Facebook has developed policies against hate speech and organizations that peddle it, we remain concerned that Facebook's policies on Dangerous Individuals and Organizations, including but not limited to its policies on white nationalist and white supremacist content, are not enforced quickly and comprehensively enough./9 Content that violates Facebook's own policies too often escapes removal just because it comes as coded language, rather than specific magic words. And even where Facebook takes steps to address a particular violation, it often fails to proactively address the follow-on actions by replacement or splinter groups that quickly emerge.
* Allow public, third-party audits of hate content and enforcement: To gauge the ongoing progress of Facebook's enforcement efforts, independent experts should be permitted access to the data necessary to conduct regular, transparent third-party audits of hate and hate-related misinformation on the platform, including any information made available to the Global Oversight Board. As part of this effort, Facebook should capture data on the prevalence of different forms of hate content on the platform, whether or not covered by Facebook's own community standards, thus allowing the public to determine whether enforcement of anti-hate policies differs based on the type of hate content at issue.
* Commit to an ongoing, independent analysis of Facebook's content population scheme and the prompt development of best practices guidance: By funneling users toward particular types of content, Facebook's content population scheme, including its algorithms, can push users into extremist online communities that feature divisive and inflammatory messages, often directed at particular groups. Although Facebook has conducted research and considered programs to reduce this risk, there is still no mandatory guidance for coders and other teams involved in content population. Facebook should commit to an ongoing, independent analysis of its content population scheme, including its algorithms, and also continuously implement mandatory protocols as best practices are identified to curb bias and prevent recommendations of hate content and groups.
* Expand policies limiting inflammatory advertisements that vilify minority groups: Although Facebook currently prohibits ads that claim that certain people, because of their membership in a protected group, pose a threat to the physical safety of communities or the nation, its policies still allow attacks that characterize such groups as threats to national culture or values.10 The current prohibition should be expanded to include such ads.
We also recommend the following measures to improve the supportive services that Facebook offers to users who have been or may become victims of harassment and intimidation on its platforms:
* Offer live real-time assistance: Facebook users can report intimidation and harassment but cannot immediately engage a Facebook employee who can promptly address issues that are occurring in real time. Victims of intimidation and harassment would benefit from more immediate access to Facebook employees who can offer prompt assistance. For example, if a user is being doxed, live assistance could help stop the spread of the user's personal information before the damage cannot be undone.
* Make information about harassment and intimidation more readily available: Facebook should facilitate evidence preservation and cooperate with victims and law enforcement agencies seeking evidence to prove a case of harassment or intimidation, such as cyberstalking or non-consensual distribution of intimate imagery, when the offenders use Facebook to perpetrate their crimes.
* Strengthen filtering, reporting, and blocking tools: Facebook allows users to block individual people, but users should have stronger tools and more choices for filtering out and reporting hateful, intimidating, and harassing content they do not want to see in their feeds. For example, if members of a Facebook group are engaged in an organized campaign of harassment against a single user, the victim should be able to block all members of the group and report batches of posts or users without having to block or report each individually.
We urge Facebook to take these steps to better tackle hate in our society, and address the interests of users who are victimized by others in the online community that Facebook has built.

He was then detained at Rikers Island until a jury acquitted him of all charges in June 2014. After his release, Frost filed a civil rights action against several groups of defendants, including New York City Police Department detectives, New York City Department of Correction officers, and the City of New York. As relevant here, Frost brought claims in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York for malicious prosecution, due process violations, the use of excessive force, and municipal liability. The district court (Buchwald, J.) granted summary judgment in favor of defendants and dismissed Frost’s complaint in its entirety. On appeal, we conclude that the district court correctly dismissed Frost’s malicious prosecution claim and one of his excessive force claims, but the district court erred in dismissing Frost’s due process claim and two of his excessive force claims. We also conclude that the district court should address the merits of Frost’s municipal liability claim in the first instance. Accordingly, the district court’s judgment is AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and VACATED in part, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Judge Kearse dissents in part in a separate opinion. _______________ JONATHAN I. EDELSTEIN (Ellie A. Silverman, on the brief), Edelstein & Grossman, New York, NY, for Plaintiff-Appellant. CLAIBOURNE HENRY (Richard Dearing, Scott Shorr, on the brief), Assistant Corporation Counsel, for James E. Johnson, 1 The Clerk of Court is directed to amend the caption as set forth above. Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page2 of 57 3 Corporation Counsel of the City of New York, New York, NY, for Defendants-Appellees. _______________ KATZMANN, Circuit Judge: This case arises out of the detention and prosecution of plaintiff-appellant Jarrett Frost. In January 2011, Frost was arrested and charged with the murder of an individual named Mavon Chapman. Frost was then detained at Rikers Island until June 2014, when a jury acquitted him of all charges. After his release, Frost filed a civil rights action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against several groups of defendants, including New York City Police Department (“NYPD”) detectives, New York City Department of Correction (“DOC”) officers, and the City of New York. As relevant here, Frost brought malicious prosecution and due process claims against the NYPD detectives, excessive force claims against the DOC officers, and municipal liability claims against the City. After a lengthy discovery period, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, which the district court granted in a Memorandum and Order dated March 27, 2019. See Frost v. City of New York, No. 15 Civ. 4843 (NRB), 2019 WL 1382323 (S.D.N.Y Mar. 27, 2019). With respect to the malicious prosecution, due Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page3 of 57 4 process, and excessive force claims, the district court (Buchwald, J.) held that Frost had failed to create a triable issue regarding any individual defendant’s liability. Id. at *8–12. And because no individual defendant could be held liable, the district court concluded, Frost’s municipal liability claims against the City failed as well. Id. at *12. On appeal, we hold that the district court correctly dismissed Frost’s malicious prosecution claim and one of his excessive force claims, but the district court erred in dismissing Frost’s due process claim and two of his excessive force claims.2 We also conclude that the district court should address the substance of Frost’s municipal liability claims in the first instance, as certain individual defendants now face potential liability. Accordingly, the district court’s judgment is AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and VACATED in part, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 2 As discussed below, the district court correctly dismissed the excessive force claim arising out of the January 16, 2013 incident, but it erred in dismissing the claims arising out of the October 9, 2012 and July 16, 2013 incidents. Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page4 of 57 5 BACKGROUND I. The Murder of Mavon Chapman Mavon Chapman was shot and killed in the early morning hours of July 6, 2010. The shooting took place at the corner of East 149th Street and Morris Avenue in the Bronx, one block from the apartment building where Frost lived. Approximately 24 hours prior to the shooting, Frost had been assaulted in the same area by members of a neighborhood gang, some of whom were friends of Chapman’s. Shortly after Chapman was killed, defendants Detectives Michael Lopuzzo, Richard Spennicchia, and Joseph O’Neil were assigned to investigate the murder. They interviewed several witnesses to the shooting, including non-party Leon Vega, who was one of the gang members who assaulted Frost the day before. None of the witnesses could identify the shooter, but they told the detectives that the shots had come from the direction of the apartment complex where Frost lived. Vega was interviewed twice on the day of Chapman’s murder, and during his first interview he told detectives that he did not know who had shot Chapman or where the shots had come from. During his second interview, however, Vega said that the shots had come from a doorway leading to a stairwell in Frost’s apartment Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page5 of 57 6 complex and that a black male wearing a white t-shirt had been standing in the doorway at the time of the shooting. In the hours following Chapman’s murder, O’Neil and Spennicchia visited the crime scene and recovered surveillance footage from the stairwell described by Vega. The footage showed two black males walking down the stairs and then running back up immediately after Chapman was shot. One of the men, later identified as non-party John McLaurin, was wearing a white tank top and jeans. The other, later identified as Frost, was wearing a green t-shirt and tan shorts. The next day, July 7, O’Neil and Spennicchia picked Frost up at school to question him. At the time, the detectives considered Frost to be a witness. Frost admitted that he had been in the stairwell with McLaurin when Chapman was shot, but he told the detectives that McLaurin had fired the gun. The detectives did not arrest Frost, and they chose instead to look for McLaurin, whom they were unable to locate. Six months passed without any major developments regarding Frost. Then, on January 6, 2011, O’Neil and Spennicchia learned that Vega had been arrested for an unrelated crime and wanted to enter into a cooperation agreement in exchange for information about Chapman’s murder. The detectives went to Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page6 of 57 7 observe an interview with Vega at the Bronx District Attorney’s Office and to show Vega photo arrays. The detectives, Vega, and an assistant district attorney were present at the interview, as was Vega’s defense counsel. During the interview, Vega identified Frost from one of the photo arrays as the individual who shot Chapman. Three days later, in an apparent coincidence, Spennicchia saw McLaurin on the street, and the detectives brought him in for an interview. Like Vega, McLaurin told the detectives that Frost was responsible for the shooting. And according to McLaurin, Frost admitted that he had killed Chapman in retaliation for the previous day’s assault. On January 13, 2011—one week after Vega’s interview—Frost was arrested on charges of murder in the second degree, manslaughter with intent to cause physical injury, and criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree. The following day, Frost was arraigned and remanded to Rikers Island, and he was indicted shortly thereafter. Frost remained incarcerated at Rikers until a jury acquitted him of all charges on June 24, 2014. II. Frost’s Detention at Rikers Island During his nearly three-and-a-half-year detention at Rikers, Frost received numerous disciplinary infractions, and he was involved in multiple physical Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page7 of 57 8 altercations with correction officers and inmates. Indeed, Frost’s transgressions earned him a “Red ID” classification, which is given to inmates who are violent or are caught with weapons. Although the record below describes Frost’s misbehavior in considerable detail, only the following three incidents are relevant to the instant appeal. The first incident took place on October 9, 2012, when Frost was brought to Bronx Supreme Court for an attorney visit. While there, Frost was escorted by defendant Correction Officer Captain Clayton Jemmott, and defendant Correction Officer Jay Joye was also present. According to Jemmott, Frost became combative and said, “I should spit in your fuckin’ face. ” J.A 609:16–17. In response, Jemmott took Frost to the ground and either Jemmott or Joye kicked Frost in the ribs. Jemmott and Joye then dragged Frost on the ground by his leg shackles. Later that day, Frost was taken to a medical clinic, where he was diagnosed with a ruptured eardrum and bruising on his forehead and cheek. The second incident took place on January 16, 2013, while Frost was housed in the Central Punitive Segregation Unit (“CPSU”). As Frost was returning to the CPSU from court, he was strip searched by defendant Correction Officer Hill. After Frost removed his clothing, Hill observed a bag of contraband cheese on the Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page8 of 57 9 floor, and Hill also reported seeing a small object wrapped in black plastic. Frost turned over the cheese, but he did not relinquish the small object, which Hill reportedly saw Frost secrete in his anal cavity. Hill informed his supervisor of these events, and defendant Correction Officer Captain Ryan was assigned to lead an extraction team to recover the secreted object. Ryan assembled a team that included defendants Correction Officers Young, McLaughlin, Barksdale, Corker, and Sanchez. When Ryan’s team went to begin the extraction, Ryan first spoke with Frost for 10 to 15 minutes and ordered Frost to return the contraband. After Frost refused to turn anything over, Ryan’s extraction team entered the intake search area where Frost was located. Video footage of the extraction shows that Frost resisted the officers and tried to prevent them from entering the area by holding the door shut. Officers then struggled to restrain Frost for several minutes. After being restrained, Frost was taken to a cell where he was ordered to squat, after which a blade wrapped in electrical tape was recovered from the floor. Frost sustained bruises from the extraction. He later pled guilty to promoting prison contraband in the second degree in connection with the incident. As part of his plea allocution, Frost specifically admitted to possessing the blade. Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page9 of 57 10 The third and final incident relevant to this appeal took place on July 16, 2013, when Frost and eighteen other inmates refused to leave the CPSU recreation yard and return to their cells. Defendant Correction Officer Captain McDuffie and other correction officers spent seven hours trying to convince Frost and his fellow inmates to come back inside, but the inmates refused. Eventually McDuffie was authorized to extract Frost from the recreation yard, and he formed an extraction team that included defendants Correction Officers Soria, Previllon, Souffrant, Carty, Tatulli, and Gonzalez. Video footage shows that when the extraction team arrived at Frost’s pen in the recreation yard, Frost was positioned in a charging stance and had ripped his clothing to make elbow pads and a mouth guard. When the extraction team opened the door to the pen, Frost charged the officers and ended up on top of one of them. An extended struggle ensued, with the officers eventually restraining Frost. After Frost was restrained, the video footage appears to show one of the members of the extraction team repeatedly moving his knee toward Frost’s head. At this time, other inmates can be heard in the background yelling for the officer to stop kicking Frost in the head. As a result of the episode, Frost sustained a black eye, as well as cuts and scrapes to his forehead, wrists, and hand. Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page10 of 57 11 III. Procedural History Frost remained incarcerated at Rikers until a jury acquitted him of all charges in June 2014. Frost then commenced the underlying action on June 22, 2015, and the operative complaint was filed on February 5, 2016. As relevant here, Frost brought the following claims under 42 U.S.C § 1983: (1) malicious prosecution against the City and Detectives Spennicchia, O’Neil, and Lopuzzo; (2) excessive force against all DOC officers except Correction Officer Gonzalez; (3) substantive due process against all individual defendants; and (4) municipal liability against the City. See Frost v. City of New York, No. 15 Civ. 4843 (NRB), 2019 WL 1382323, at *1 (S.D.N.Y Mar. 27, 2019). Frost also brought several state law claims against different combinations of defendants. Id. On July 10, 2018, defendants moved for summary judgment. Frost opposed the motion, and he submitted a declaration from Leon Vega dated September 13, 2018. As noted above, Vega had failed to identify Chapman’s killer when he was first questioned by detectives on July 6, 2010, but he later pinned the shooting on Frost during his January 6, 2011 interview at the Bronx District Attorney’s Office. According to his 2018 declaration, Vega falsely identified Frost in 2011 because he was facing a felony charge, and Detectives Spennicchia and O’Neil made clear to Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page11 of 57 12 Vega that he would need to identify Frost as the shooter in order to get a deal. The truth, Vega stated, was that he had seen Frost standing in the stairwell from which Chapman was shot, but Frost had not pulled the trigger. Instead, the shooter was a second individual who was wearing a white shirt, but whom Vega was unable to identify. Vega explained that he “would never have identified Frost as the shooter if the detectives hadn’t told [him] to do so,” and he asserted that “when Frost came to trial, [Vega] refused to testify against him because [he] did not want to continue a lie. ” J.A 1603 ¶¶ 19–20. Notwithstanding Vega’s declaration, the district court granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment and dismissed Frost’s complaint in its entirety. See Frost, 2019 WL 1382323, at *12. Beginning with the malicious prosecution claim, the district court rejected Frost’s argument that the NYPD detectives had commenced a criminal proceeding against him by coercing Vega’s identification. In the district court’s view, Vega’s declaration was “‘so replete with inconsistencies and improbabilities that no reasonable juror would undertake the suspension of disbelief necessary to credit’ his allegation,” id. at *8 (quoting Jeffreys v. City of New York, 426 F.3d 549, 551 (2d Cir. 2005)),3 and prosecutors from the 3 Unless otherwise indicated, in quoting cases, all internal quotation marks, Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page12 of 57 13 Bronx District Attorney’s Office had been present at all relevant interviews and had made an independent decision to initiate proceedings against Frost, id. at *9. Furthermore, the district court reasoned, even if the detectives had commenced a criminal proceeding against Frost by coercing Vega’s identification, there was probable cause to prosecute Frost based on his undisputed presence in the stairwell from which Chapman was shot, McLaurin’s testimony identifying Frost as the shooter, and Frost’s motive to retaliate for the previous day’s assault. Id.4 Moving to Frost’s excessive force claims, the district court held that Frost did not raise a triable issue with respect to the three incidents discussed above. Regarding the October 9 incident, the district court reasoned that Frost had established himself as a violent inmate and that Jemmott and Joye responded reasonably to Frost’s threat to spit on Jemmott. Id. at *10. As to the January 16 incident, the district court held that video footage of the extraction showed that the DOC officers used reasonable force and inflicted only de minimis injuries. Id. at *11. Likewise, for the July 16 incident, the district court held that video footage alterations, emphases, footnotes, and citations are omitted. 4 Because the district court found that there was probable cause to prosecute Frost, it also found that there was no triable issue as to whether defendants acted with malice. Frost, 2019 WL 1382323, at *9 n.27 Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page13 of 57 14 showed as a matter of law that the force used to extract Frost from the recreation yard and the minor injuries that he sustained were not excessive. Id.5 Finally, the district court held that Frost failed to create a genuine dispute regarding his substantive due process claim because he failed, inter alia, to show that the NYPD detectives “provide[d] false information likely to influence a jury’s decision and forward[ed] that information to prosecutors. ” Id. at *12. The district court also held that Frost’s municipal liability claims against the City failed because his underlying claims against individual defendants failed. Id. And because the district court dismissed Frost’s federal claims, it declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his remaining state law claims and accordingly dismissed those claims without prejudice. Id. The district court entered judgment on March 28, 2019, and Frost timely appealed. 5 The district court also held that Frost failed to create a triable issue with respect to an incident that took place on July 25, 2012. Id. at *9–10. Frost does not challenge that decision on appeal. Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page14 of 57 15 DISCUSSION I. Standard of Review “We review orders granting summary judgment de novo and focus on whether the district court correctly concluded that there was no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. ” Chunn v. Amtrak, 916 F.3d 204, 207 (2d Cir. 2019). “An issue of fact is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party. A fact is material if it might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law. ” SCR Joint Venture L.P v. Warshawsky, 559 F.3d 133, 137 (2d Cir. 2009). “The burden of showing that no genuine factual dispute exists rests on the party seeking summary judgment, and in assessing the record to determine whether there is a genuine issue as to a material fact, the court is required to resolve all ambiguities and draw all permissible factual inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought. ” Sec. Ins. Co. of Hartford v. Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc., 391 F.3d 77, 83 (2d Cir. 2004). “In applying this standard, the court should not weigh evidence or assess the credibility of witnesses. These determinations are within the sole province of the jury. ” Hayes v. New York City Dep’t of Corr., 84 F.3d 614, 619 (2d Cir. 1996). Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page15 of 57 16 II. Malicious Prosecution “In order to prevail on a § 1983 claim against a state actor for malicious prosecution, a plaintiff must show a violation of his rights under the Fourth Amendment and must establish the elements of a malicious prosecution claim under state law. ” Manganiello v. City of New York, 612 F.3d 149, 160–61 (2d Cir. 2010). “To establish a malicious prosecution claim under New York law, a plaintiff must prove (1) the initiation or continuation of a criminal proceeding against plaintiff; (2) termination of the proceeding in plaintiff’s favor; (3) lack of probable cause for commencing the proceeding; and (4) actual malice as a motivation for defendant’s actions. ” Id. at 161. The district court dismissed Frost’s malicious prosecution claim after concluding that defendants did not initiate a criminal proceeding against Frost and that, in the alternative, Frost’s prosecution was supported by probable cause. See Frost v. City of New York, No. 15 Civ. 4843 (NRB), 2019 WL 1382323, at *8–9 (S.D.N.Y Mar. 27, 2019). While acknowledging that police officers can initiate criminal proceedings by “creat[ing] false information and forward[ing] it to prosecutors,” id. at *8; see Ricciuti v. N.Y.C Transit Auth., 124 F.3d 123, 130 (2d Cir. 1997), the district court held that no reasonable juror would credit the allegations Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page16 of 57 17 in Vega’s declaration that defendants had coerced him into identifying Frost, Frost, 2019 WL 1382323, at *8. The district court also reasoned that prosecutors from the Bronx District Attorney’s Office made an independent decision to initiate proceedings against Frost, thus absolving defendants of liability. Id. at *9. And with respect to probable cause, the district court concluded that Frost’s prosecution was justified by his undisputed presence at the scene of the crime, McLaurin’s identification of Frost as the shooter, and the fact that Frost had a motive to retaliate for the previous day’s assault. Id.6 For the reasons discussed below in the context of Frost’s due process claim, we hold that the district court erred in discrediting Vega’s declaration at the summary judgment stage. We nevertheless agree with the district court that there was probable cause to prosecute Frost, even without Vega’s identification. And because “the existence of probable cause is a complete defense to a claim of malicious prosecution,” Stansbury v. Wertman, 721 F.3d 84, 94–95 (2d Cir. 2013), we conclude that the district court was correct to dismiss Frost’s claim.7 6 The district court also held that Frost failed to raise a triable issue as to malice because there was probable cause to prosecute him. Frost, 2019 WL 1382323, at *9 n.27 7 Because the existence of probable cause is dispositive of Frost’s malicious Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page17 of 57 18 “Probable cause, in the context of malicious prosecution, has . . . been described as such facts and circumstances as would lead a reasonably prudent person to believe the plaintiff guilty. ” Boyd v. City of New York, 336 F.3d 72, 76 (2d Cir. 2003).8 We have recognized that, in general, “[p]robable cause is a mixed question of law and fact. ” Dufort v. City of New York, 874 F.3d 338, 348 (2d Cir. 2017). In a case such as this one, however, “where there is no dispute as to what facts were relied on to demonstrate probable cause, the existence of probable cause is a question of law for the court. ” Walczyk v. Rio, 496 F.3d 139, 157 (2d Cir. 2007). As the district court explained, the following facts are undisputed: First, defendants recovered surveillance footage showing Frost and McLaurin walking down and then running up the stairwell from which Chapman was shot, prosecution claim, we need not decide whether prosecutors made an independent decision to initiate proceedings against Frost, thereby absolving defendants of liability. We also need not decide whether Frost raised a triable issue as to malice. 8 “Even in the absence of probable cause, a police officer is entitled to qualified immunity where (1) her conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known, or (2) it was objectively reasonable for her to believe that her actions were lawful at the time of the challenged act. ” Betts v. Shearman, 751 F.3d 78, 82–83 (2d Cir. 2014). However, “the defense of qualified immunity can . . . be forfeited,” Fabrikant v. French, 691 F.3d 193, 211–12 (2d Cir. 2012), and defendants have failed to raise it before this Court in the context of Frost’s malicious prosecution claim. Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page18 of 57 19 immediately after Chapman was shot. Second, Frost admitted to defendants that he was in the stairwell with McLaurin when Chapman was shot, and McLaurin identified Frost as the shooter. And third, defendants were aware that Frost had a motive to retaliate against Chapman because Frost had been assaulted by Chapman’s friends the night before. Given these undisputed facts, we conclude as a matter of law that a reasonably prudent person would have been led to believe that Frost was guilty of shooting Chapman. See Boyd, 336 F.3d at 76.9 Frost resists this conclusion, and he cites our decision in Dufort v. City of New York, 874 F.3d 338 (2d Cir. 2017), for the proposition that an individual’s presence at the scene of a crime and his identification by a fellow suspect are insufficient to establish probable cause. But Dufort is inapposite. As relevant here, Dufort involved an attack by multiple assailants, and the plaintiff was arrested “based on little more than a witness’s statement that he” was one of several people present who wore a similar shirt to one of the attackers. 874 F.3d at 350. The plaintiff was also identified by a co-defendant who was facing a possible prison sentence of fifty years to life, and who testified only equivocally that he thought the plaintiff 9 Because the undisputed facts support a finding of probable cause, we need not address whether Frost’s indictment created a presumption of probable cause. See Savino v. City of New York, 331 F.3d 63, 72 (2d Cir. 2003). Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page19 of 57 20 participated in the attack. Id. at 351. In the instant case, by contrast, surveillance footage unambiguously places Frost in the stairwell from which the shots were fired. Furthermore, McLaurin—who was not arrested in connection with Chapman’s murder—unequivocally identified Frost as the shooter. Frost’s position is further undermined by analogous cases in which we have held that an individual’s presence in the location from which shots are fired can support a finding of probable cause. In Thomas v. City of New York, 562 F. App’x 58 (2d Cir. 2014), we held that there was probable cause to arrest the plaintiff where “the facts available . . . at the time of the arrest included (1) evidence that [the victim] was shot at close range; (2) [the victim’s] photo array identification of [the plaintiff] as the individual who walked by him on an otherwise empty street moments before he was shot; and (3) [the victim’s] statement that, after he was shot, he turned and saw [the plaintiff] standing on the sidewalk in the direction of the continued gunfire. ” Id. at 59–60. We explained that probable cause existed even though the victim did not see whether the plaintiff was holding a gun. Id. at 60. Likewise, in Husbands ex rel. Forde v. City of New York, 335 F. App’x 124 (2d Cir. 2009), we held that there was probable cause to arrest the plaintiff “[g]iven the undisputed facts . . . that shots were suddenly fired, that [an officer] saw [the Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page20 of 57 21 plaintiff] when he looked in the direction from which the shots had been fired, that [the plaintiff] was standing alone, and that [the plaintiff] promptly turned around and proceeded” in the direction from which the shots came. Id. at 127. Again, we made clear that probable cause did not depend on “whether or not [the officer] actually saw a gun. ” Id. Here, there is no dispute that Frost was present in the location from which Chapman was shot, at the time that Chapman was shot. Viewed in light of Thomas and Husbands, these facts alone tend to weigh in favor of a finding of probable cause. And although the plaintiffs in Thomas and Husbands were by themselves, whereas Frost was with McLaurin, we conclude that McLaurin’s identification of Frost and Frost’s retaliatory motive compensate for any reduction in probable cause that this distinction introduces. With respect to this latter point in particular, Frost offers no reason to discount the significance of his motive. Instead, he makes only the conclusory assertion that his “alleged motive . . . is . . . insufficient” to support a finding of probable cause. Appellant’s Br. 32. Because we believe that Frost’s motive is significant, and because the undisputed facts, taken together, would have led a reasonably prudent person to believe that Frost shot Chapman, Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page21 of 57 22 we conclude that Frost’s prosecution was supported by probable cause. The district court was therefore correct to dismiss his malicious prosecution claim. III. Due Process The Due Process Clause guarantees a criminal defendant’s “right to a fair trial. ” Ramchair v. Conway, 601 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir. 2010). This right is violated “[w]hen a police officer creates false information likely to influence a jury’s decision and forwards that information to prosecutors. ” Ricciuti v. N.Y.C Transit Auth., 124 F.3d 123, 130 (2d Cir. 1997). Such violations are “redressable in an action for damages under 42 U.S.C § 1983. ” Id. And unlike a malicious prosecution claim, “a Section 1983 claim for the denial of a right to a fair trial based on an officer’s provision of false information to prosecutors can stand even if the officer had probable cause to arrest the Section 1983 plaintiff. ” Garnett v. Undercover Officer C0039, 838 F.3d 265, 277–78 (2d Cir. 2016). In the proceedings below, Frost alleged substantive due process violations against all individual defendants. See Frost v. City of New York, No. 15 Civ. 4843 (NRB), 2019 WL 1382323, at *1 (S.D.N.Y Mar. 27, 2019). The only violations relevant to the instant appeal, however, are those alleged against the NYPD detectives. Specifically, Frost argues that the detectives deprived him of due Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page22 of 57 23 process by coercing Vega into identifying him as the shooter and by giving this evidence to prosecutors, who used it to seek Frost’s detention at Rikers Island and to bring him to trial on the underlying charges.10 Although the district court did not discuss Frost’s due process argument in detail, it suggested that the claim failed because there was no evidence that the NYPD detectives “provide[d] false information likely to influence a jury’s decision and forward[ed] that information to prosecutors. ” Id. at *12. This suggestion followed from the district court’s earlier conclusion, in the context of Frost’s malicious prosecution claim, that there was no genuine dispute as to whether defendants coerced Vega into falsely identifying Frost because Vega’s declaration was “‘so replete with inconsistencies and improbabilities that no reasonable juror would undertake the suspension of disbelief necessary to credit’ his allegation. ” Id. at *8 (quoting Jeffreys v. City of New York, 426 F.3d 549, 551 (2d Cir. 2005)). On appeal, Frost argues that the district court erred both in discrediting Vega’s 10 Frost also argues that the detectives deprived him of due process by failing to forward exculpatory evidence to prosecutors. Because we reverse the dismissal of Frost’s due process claim on other grounds, and because the district court did not address Frost’s exculpatory evidence argument below, we leave this argument for the district court to resolve in the first instance. Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page23 of 57 24 declaration at the summary judgment stage and in dismissing Frost’s due process claim as a result. For the reasons below, we agree. It is a bedrock rule of civil procedure that “a district court generally cannot grant summary judgment based on its assessment of the credibility of the evidence presented. ” Agosto v. INS, 436 U.S 748, 756 (1978). In Jeffreys v. City of New York, however, we recognized a narrow exception “in the rare circumstance where the plaintiff relies almost exclusively on his own testimony, much of which is contradictory and incomplete. ” 426 F.3d at 554. In such an extraordinary case, we said, “it will be impossible for a district court to determine whether the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff, and thus whether there are any genuine issues of material fact, without making some assessment of the plaintiff’s account. ” Id. Relying on our decision in Jeffreys, the district court concluded that multiple aspects of Vega’s declaration rendered his allegations incredible. First, the district court observed that “[t]he scant, three-page declaration . . . was signed more than three years after plaintiff and his counsel filed this instant action, six months after the discovery period concluded, and two months after defendants filed their summary judgment motion. ” Frost, 2019 WL 1382323, at *8. More significantly, the district court noted that Vega’s declaration “omits the undisputed and Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page24 of 57 25 determinative fact that Vega’s attorney and an ADA were present at his interview with the detectives. ” Id. The district court emphasized with respect to this latter point that “Vega’s assertion, if true, would mean that the two attorneys present during the interview, in violation of their ethical and legal obligations, condoned, countenanced and permitted the detectives to coerce Vega into testifying falsely. ” Id. On appeal, Frost argues that the district court erred in applying Jeffreys beyond its scope. Frost contends that Vega’s declaration was “consistent and uncomplicated,” Appellant’s Br. 21 (quoting Bellamy v. City of New York, 914 F.3d 727, 746 (2d Cir. 2019)), unlike the plaintiff’s self-serving testimony in Jeffreys. Frost also asserts that Vega’s declaration is corroborated by his initial inability to identify Chapman’s shooter when detectives first questioned him on July 6, 2010. And while Frost acknowledges that Vega’s “declaration implies that Vega’s attorney and the ADAs acted unethically,” he notes that “it is hardly unheard-of for prosecutors to act overzealously in pursuit of a conviction or for a witness’ counsel to go along with such overzealousness if it benefits his client. ” Id. at 23. In response, defendants offer several reasons why they believe the district court correctly disregarded Vega’s “eleventh-hour declaration. ” Appellees’ Br. 24. Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page25 of 57 26 As relevant here, defendants argue that the declaration is inconsistent with Vega’s initial police interviews, which did not clearly exculpate Frost or inculpate the individual (presumably McLaurin) who was wearing the white shirt. Defendants also contend that there is an internal inconsistency between Vega’s acknowledgement, on the one hand, that he initiated contact with the Bronx District Attorney’s Office in January 2011, and his allegation, on the other, that he was coerced into identifying Frost at the ensuing interview. Likewise, defendants assert that Vega’s statement in his declaration that “he ‘refused to testify against [Frost] because [he] did not want to continue a lie’” is unsupported by the record given that Vega “made no effort on the witness stand to recant his original identification of Frost as the shooter. ” Id. at 27 (quoting J.A 1603 ¶ 20) (alterations in original). And finally, defendants reiterate the district court’s concern that Vega’s declaration alleges ethical and legal violations by the attorneys present at his January 2011 interview. Although we are sympathetic to some of defendants’ criticisms, we nevertheless agree with Frost that the district court extended Jeffreys too far. As we have said, the Jeffreys exception is narrow, and it applies only “in the rare circumstance where” a witness’s testimony is so problematic that no reasonable Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page26 of 57 27 juror could credit it. Jeffreys, 426 F.3d at 554. Where, by contrast, “there is a plausible explanation for discrepancies in a [witness’s] testimony, the court considering a summary judgment motion should not disregard the later testimony because of an earlier account that was ambiguous, confusing, or simply incomplete. ” Id. at 555 n.2 And “[i]n the ordinary case where a district court is asked to consider the contradictory deposition testimony [or declaration] of a fact witness, or where the contradictions presented are not real, unequivocal, and inescapable, the general rule remains that a district court may not discredit a witness’s deposition testimony [or declaration] on a motion for summary judgment, because the assessment of a witness’s credibility is a function reserved for the jury. ” In re Fosamax Prod. Liab. Litig., 707 F.3d 189, 194 n.4 (2d Cir. 2013) (per curiam). Here, Vega’s declaration presents us with an “ordinary case,” not a “rare circumstance. ” It is true that the document was introduced late in the proceedings below and that the substance of Vega’s allegations is somewhat meager. These deficiencies, however, are not serious enough to render the declaration incredible as a matter of law. Defendants cite prior decisions from this Court for the proposition that “witnesses are not permitted to raise a sham issue of fact by Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page27 of 57 28 submitting a blatantly manufactured affidavit that contradicted a prior statement. ” Appellees’ Br. 29 (citing Perma Research & Dev. Co. v. Singer Co., 410 F.2d 572, 578 (2d Cir. 1969)); see Hayes v. New York City Dep’t of Corr., 84 F.3d 614, 619 (2d Cir. 1996). But even assuming that the “sham issue of fact” doctrine applies where the witness’s prior statements are unsworn, years-old police interviews, Vega’s declaration is not sufficiently “manufactured” or contradictory to bring it within the doctrine’s ambit. Contrary to defendants’ characterization, there is a plausible explanation for any discrepancies between Vega’s 2018 declaration and his earlier interviews with law enforcement. Take Vega’s statement in 2018 that Frost did not kill Chapman. Obviously, this is inconsistent with Vega’s identification of Frost as the shooter during his January 2011 interview at the Bronx District Attorney’s Office. But the inconsistency between Vega’s earlier and later positions does not make them irreconcilable. Instead, Vega’s declaration offers a plausible account of his evolving story: in 2011, he was facing a felony charge and wanted to make a deal with prosecutors, and by 2018 he had changed his mind and decided that he wanted to tell the truth. To conclude, as we do, that the explanations are plausible Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page28 of 57 29 is not to say that we make any judgment as to whether they will carry the day; we determine only that this issue cannot be resolved at the summary judgment stage. We are conscious of the concerns raised by defendants and the district court that Vega’s declaration, if true, describes ethical and legal violations by his defense counsel and the assistant district attorney who interviewed him. And we certainly have no reason to think that such violations are anything but rare. But we cannot conclude as a matter of law that allegations of attorney misconduct are too implausible to create a genuine dispute of material fact. Indeed, if we were to adopt such a conclusion, entire categories of lawsuits would be precluded from making it past summary judgment. Nor is Vega’s declaration irreconcilable with the two initial interviews that he had with law enforcement on the day of Chapman’s murder. As noted above, Vega first told detectives that he did not know who shot Chapman or where the shots came from, and he later said that the shots came from Frost’s apartment building and that a man wearing a white shirt was standing in the doorway from which the shots came. Defendants argue that these statements contradict Vega’s more definitive assertion in his declaration that the man in the white shirt was the shooter. But we see no necessary contradiction—let alone a contradiction that is Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page29 of 57 30 “real, unequivocal, and inescapable,” Fosamax, 707 F.3d at 194 n.4—between Vega’s statement in 2018 that the man in the white shirt was the shooter and his statement in 2010 that the man in the white shirt was standing in the building doorway from which the shots were fired. And while there may be inconsistencies between Vega’s first and second interviews in the hours immediately following Chapman’s murder, these discrepancies at most raise garden variety credibility issues regarding Vega’s initial account. They do not provide grounds for the district court to disregard Vega’s later declaration on a motion for summary judgment. See Jeffreys, 426 F.3d at 555 n.2 Finally, we are not persuaded by defendants’ argument that Vega’s declaration was properly discredited based on its internal inconsistencies and lack of support in the record. Defendants suggest that Vega would not have initiated contact with the Bronx District Attorney’s Office in January 2011 if he had not already intended to identify Frost. And they imply that Vega would have recanted his false identification at Frost’s trial if he had really been motivated by a desire to tell the truth. But these assumptions, while plausible, are not self-evident, and they certainly are not fatal to the credibility of Vega’s declaration. There are any number of benign or malign explanations for the purported deficiencies raised by Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page30 of 57 31 defendants, and it is not the role of the district court to choose among them at the summary judgment stage. Instead, as even Frost acknowledges, the most appropriate use for defendants’ criticisms is as “fodder for cross-examination of Vega at trial. ” Reply Br. 6. We conclude, therefore, that Vega’s declaration does not present the kind of “rare circumstance” contemplated by Jeffreys, and that the district court erred in discrediting it.11 Defendants nevertheless argue that we should affirm the district court’s dismissal of Frost’s due process claim because, even assuming that Vega’s identification was coerced, Frost has failed to raise a triable issue as to whether the identification resulted in a deprivation of his liberty. Specifically, defendants contend that “there was sufficient evidence to prosecute Frost without Vega’s identification” and that Frost “has never argued that, but for Vega’s identification, he would not have been indicted and incarcerated during the course of his trial. ” Appellees’ Br. 40. 11 In our analysis, we have assumed without deciding that Jeffreys applies to the testimony of non-party fact witnesses. Because we conclude that it was error to discredit Vega’s declaration even under the Jeffreys standard, we need not address Frost’s broader contention that district courts may never discredit nonparty fact witness testimony at the summary judgment stage. Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page31 of 57 32 Defendants’ argument falls short for two reasons.12 First, as noted above, probable cause is not a defense to a fair trial claim based on the fabrication of evidence. See Garnett, 838 F.3d at 277–78. Instead, even if “a privileged arrest accounted for at least some portion of the deprivation of [a § 1983 plaintiff’s] liberty,” the plaintiff may still “suffer[] a deprivation of liberty as a result of [an] officer’s fabrication. ” Id. at 277. It is therefore irrelevant that “there was sufficient evidence to prosecute Frost without Vega’s identification. ” Appellees’ Br. 40. Second, defendants miss the mark in their assessment that Frost has not raised a triable issue regarding causation. As we have explained, a “prosecutor’s decision to pursue charges rather than to dismiss [a] complaint without further action[] may depend on the prosecutor’s . . . assessment[] of the strength of the case, which in turn may be critically influenced by fabricated evidence. ” Garnett, 838 F.3d at 277. Here, a reasonable jury could have found that Vega’s identification “critically influenced” the decision to prosecute Frost. See id. It is undisputed that defendants knew the day after Chapman’s shooting that Frost was standing with 12 As with Frost’s malicious prosecution claim, defendants do not raise a qualified immunity defense. Even if they did, however, such a defense would fail, as “there is a clearly established constitutional right not to be deprived of liberty as a result of the fabrication of evidence by a government officer acting in an investigatory capacity. ” Garnett, 838 F.3d at 276. Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page32 of 57 33 McLaurin in the stairwell from which the shots were fired and that Frost had been assaulted the night before by Chapman’s friends. For six months, however, defendants took no action, and it was only after Vega identified Frost as the shooter that Frost was arrested and prosecuted. This sudden change suggests that Vega’s identification was influential. And while it is true that McLaurin also identified Frost between the time of Vega’s interview and Frost’s arrest, a reasonable jury could have found that the decision to prosecute Frost would have been different if McLaurin, who was Frost’s fellow suspect, was the only person to identify him. This is all that is necessary to sustain Frost’s due process claim. The dissent would hold otherwise on this point. The dissent notes, as we do, that independent evidence was sufficient to create probable cause for Frost’s pretrial detention. The dissent also finds great significance in the fact that Vega’s purportedly coerced identification did not taint Frost’s trial itself, because Vega refused to testify that Frost was the shooter. The dissent thus argues that Frost’s “fair trial” claim under the Due Process Clause fails as a matter of law. We respectfully think our precedents are to the contrary. Notwithstanding the nomenclature, a criminal defendant’s right to a fair trial protects more than the fairness of the trial itself. Indeed, a criminal defendant can bring a fair trial claim Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page33 of 57 34 even when no trial occurs at all. Our decision in Ricciuti is illustrative in this respect. One of the plaintiffs there, Alfred Ricciuti, was arrested and charged with second-degree assault after a post-Yankees-game altercation. 124 F.3d at 125–26. Ricciuti alleged that one of the defendant police officers, Lt. Robert Wheeler, fabricated a confession statement and forwarded it to the Bronx district attorney, who subsequently added a charge against Ricciuti for second-degree aggravated harassment. Id. at 126. Although all charges against Ricciuti were dismissed before trial, id. at 127, we held that there was a genuine issue of fact as to whether Lt. Wheeler and other defendant officers had knowingly fabricated and forwarded a false confession to prosecutors, id. at 129–30. As noted above, we explained that “[w]hen a police officer creates false information likely to influence a jury’s decision and forwards that information to prosecutors, he violates the accused’s constitutional right to a fair trial, and the harm occasioned by such an unconscionable action is redressable in an action for damages under 42 U.S.C § 1983. ” Id. at 130. And we concluded that “a reasonable jury could find, based on the evidence, that defendants . . . violated [Ricciuti’s] clearly established constitutional rights by conspiring to Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page34 of 57 35 fabricate and forward to prosecutors a known false confession almost certain to influence a jury’s verdict. ” Id. The dissent nevertheless argues that, because the charges against Ricciuti were dismissed before trial, his claim is more accurately described as a malicious prosecution claim under the Fourth Amendment, rather than a fair trial claim under the Due Process Clause. Post at 4–5. According to the dissent, the real constitutional claim in Ricciuti was that, although there was probable cause to believe an assault had occurred, there was no probable cause “for magnifying the charge to a crime of bias, which was the only basis for keeping plaintiffs detained. ” Id. at 5. However, this interpretation is hard to square with our decision in Ricciuti itself, which analyzed the question of probable cause at length in the context of Ricciuti’s other claims, see 124 F.3d at 127–29, 130–31, but did not so much as mention it in the context of his fair trial claim, id. at 129–30. We cannot conclude that the Ricciuti decision “mislabel[ed] the claim it was upholding. ” Post at 5. Rather, the court employed an entirely different mode of analysis than the malicious-prosecution framing that the dissent now urges. We respectfully believe that the dissent’s interpretation of our fair trial precedent is also foreclosed by Zahrey v. Coffey, 221 F.3d 342 (2d Cir. 2000), where Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page35 of 57 36 the court again recognized a fair trial claim in a similar circumstance. The plaintiff there, Zaher Zahrey, was prosecuted for conspiracy to commit robberies, among other counts, and was detained without bail for eight months. Id. at 346. In his § 1983 suit against various police officers and prosecutors, Zahrey alleged that the defendants had deprived him of liberty by coercing two witnesses, Lisa Rivera and Sidney Quick, to testify falsely against Zahrey before a grand jury, thereby resulting in his pretrial detention. Id. at 345–46. On these facts, we held that Zahrey had adequately stated a claim under § 1983 for, inter alia, denial of his “right to a fair trial under the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. ” Id. at 346. Unlike the plaintiff in Ricciuti, Zahrey eventually proceeded to trial before a jury in the Eastern District of New York, whereupon he was acquitted on all counts. Id. But our analysis of Zahrey’s Due Process claim focused not on the events at his trial, but on the deprivation of liberty resulting from the purportedly coerced grand jury testimony. See id. at 348–49. Finally, in Garnett, the court expressly rejected the dissent’s argument, post at 4–7, that a challenge to the use of fabricated evidence pre-trial “is only cognizable as a claim for malicious prosecution or for false arrest under the Fourth Amendment, and not as an independent fair trial claim. ” 838 F.3d at 278. Rather, Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page36 of 57 37 we explained that “fair trial claims cover kinds of police misconduct not addressed by false arrest or malicious prosecution claims,” and that therefore “probable cause, which is a Fourth Amendment concept, should not be used to immunize a police officer who violates an arrestee’s non-Fourth Amendment constitutional rights. ” Id.13 Taken together, then, Garnett, Zahrey, and Ricciuti establish that the (perhaps imprecisely named) fair trial right protects against deprivation of liberty that results when a police officer fabricates and forwards evidence to a prosecutor that would be likely to influence a jury’s decision, were that evidence presented to the jury. See Zahrey, 221 F.3d at 355 (“It is firmly established that a constitutional right exists not to be deprived of liberty on the basis of false evidence fabricated by a government officer. ”). And we have expressly distinguished this right from the separate, although related, right not to be convicted based on the use of false 13 To be sure, in Garnett itself, the defendant stood trial. 838 F.3d at 270. But we never suggested that fair trial claims are limited to such cases; to the contrary, we repeatedly emphasized that the elements of a fair trial claim are only that the officer fabricated information that would be likely to influence a jury’s verdict, forwarded the information to prosecutors, and thereby deprived the defendant of liberty. Id. at 279. And we based this rule largely on Ricciuti, id. at 277, 279–80, which, as already discussed, did not involve the presentation of false evidence at trial. Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page37 of 57 38 evidence at trial. See id. (“It has also long been established that a prosecutor who knowingly uses false evidence at trial to obtain a conviction acts unconstitutionally. ”). In the instant case, Frost raises a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether he was thus deprived of his liberty. As explained above, there is a triable question as to whether Vega’s identification of Frost was coerced. Similarly, there is a triable question as to whether Vega’s identification would likely have influenced the jury at Frost’s criminal trial given that Vega, unlike McLaurin, was not Frost’s fellow suspect. These two facts, in turn, create a genuine dispute as to whether Vega’s identification “critically influenced” the decision to prosecute Frost, Garnett, 838 F.3d at 277, thereby resulting in a deprivation of his liberty. Dufort v. City of New York does not compel a different result. The plaintiff’s contention there was that the defendants “misrepresented or withheld key evidence at his criminal trial. ” 874 F.3d 338, 354 (2d Cir. 2017) (emphasis added). The court construed the plaintiff’s claim as a “due process claim [that] rests [on] the right to have one’s case tried based on an accurate evidentiary record that has not been manipulated by the prosecution. ” Id. at 355. Accordingly, we held that the plaintiff’s claim failed as a matter of law because the defendants’ attempts to Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page38 of 57 39 distort the record at his criminal trial had failed. Id. Concededly, it is undisputed here that Vega’s allegedly coerced identification of Frost could not have “distort[ed] the record” at Frost’s trial, id., because Vega did not repeat this identification in his trial testimony. But Frost, unlike the plaintiff in Dufort, does not ground his due process claim in allegations that the defendants attempted to distort the record at his criminal trial; instead, he grounds his claim in allegations that the defendants fabricated evidence much earlier in the process and forwarded that evidence to prosecutors, thereby depriving Frost of his liberty. Dufort did not question the validity of such claims; to the contrary, it recognized, as did Zahrey, that the right “not to be deprived of liberty as a result of the fabrication of evidence by a government officer acting in an investigatory capacity” is distinct from the right not to be tried based on “a distorted evidentiary record being presented to the jury. ” Id. at 354–55. It is true that Dufort states that “[m]ere attempts to withhold or falsify evidence cannot form the basis for a § 1983 claim for a violation of the right to due process when those attempts have no impact on the conduct of a criminal trial. ” Id at 355. But this characterization must be read in light of the claim presented in that case, which, again, was directed exclusively to the presentation of evidence at trial. Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page39 of 57 40 We do not think Dufort can be read to hold that no due process claim based on the falsification of evidence can be maintained unless the evidence affects the ultimate criminal trial. Such a holding would be inconsistent with Zahrey—a case on which Dufort relies, id. at 354–55—as well as with Ricciuti.14 Because we conclude that there is a triable issue as to whether defendants coerced Vega into falsely identifying Frost, and as to whether Vega’s identification resulted in Frost’s prosecution, Frost’s due process claim should not have been dismissed.15 To be clear, we offer no view as to the ultimate outcome. We conclude only that there are triable issues of fact such that resolution at summary judgment is not appropriate. 14 The Supreme Court’s holding in Manuel v. City of Joliet, 137 S. Ct. 911 (2017), relied upon by the dissent, post at 6–8, does not compel a different result. In Manuel, the Supreme Court held that a § 1983 plaintiff could challenge his pretrial detention based on purportedly fabricated evidence under the Fourth Amendment, even after a judge determined that this evidence constituted probable cause. 137 S. Ct. at 914–15. But just as a Fourth Amendment claim survives the initiation of “legal process,” id. at 914, our precedents establish that a fair trial claim under the Due Process Clause may accrue before the trial itself. Accordingly, the holding of Manuel does not preclude Frost’s fair trial claim. 15 As noted above, the district court on remand should address Frost’s argument that defendants also deprived him of due process by failing to forward exculpatory evidence to prosecutors. In addition, the district court may wish to clarify which defendants remain implicated, at this stage in the litigation, by Frost’s due process claim. Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page40 of 57 41 IV. Excessive Force Along with safeguarding a criminal defendant’s right to a fair trial, “the Due Process Clause protects a pretrial detainee from the use of excessive force that amounts to punishment. ” Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S 386, 395 n.10 (1989). An officer’s actions can amount to punishment if they are taken with “an expressed intent to punish. ” Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S 520, 538 (1979). But even “in the absence of an expressed intent to punish, a pretrial detainee can nevertheless prevail by showing that the actions are not rationally related to a legitimate nonpunitive governmental purpose or that the actions appear excessive in relation to that purpose. ” Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 135 S. Ct. 2466, 2473 (2015). To determine whether an officer used excessive force, the factfinder must apply an “objective reasonableness” standard that “turns on the facts and circumstances of each particular case. ” Id. This standard should be applied “from the perspective and with the knowledge of the defendant officer,” id. at 2474, and it should account for such factors as “the relationship between the need for the use of force and the amount of force used; the extent of the plaintiff’s injury; any effort made by the officer to temper or to limit the amount of force; the severity of the security problem at issue; the threat reasonably perceived by the officer; and Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page41 of 57 42 whether the plaintiff was actively resisting,” id. at 2473. The factfinder must also “take account of the legitimate interests in managing a jail, acknowledging as part of the objective reasonableness analysis that deference to policies and practices needed to maintain order and institutional security is appropriate. ” Id. at 2474. “Additionally, an officer enjoys qualified immunity and is not liable for excessive force unless he has violated a clearly established right, such that it would have been clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted. ” Id.16 “Use of excessive force is an area of the law in which the result depends very much on the facts of each case, and thus . . . officers are entitled to qualified immunity unless existing precedent squarely governs the specific facts at issue. ” Kisela v. Hughes, 138 S. Ct. 1148, 1153 (2018) (per curiam). “Precedent involving similar facts can help move a case beyond the otherwise hazy border between excessive and acceptable force and thereby provide an officer notice that a specific use of force is unlawful. ” Id. 16 In contrast with Frost’s malicious prosecution and due process claims, defendants have raised a qualified immunity defense to Frost’s excessive force claims. Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page42 of 57 43 The district court dismissed Frost’s excessive force claims arising out of the incidents that occurred on October 9, 2012, January 16, 2013, and July 16, 2013. Frost v. City of New York, No. 15 Civ. 4843 (NRB), 2019 WL 1382323, at *10–11 (S.D.N.Y Mar. 27, 2019).17 Frost challenges each of these decisions on appeal. For the reasons below, we agree with Frost that the district court erred in dismissing the claims arising out of the October 9 and July 16 incidents, but we conclude that dismissal of the claim arising out of the January 16 incident was warranted. A. October 9, 2012 Incident Beginning with the first incident, the following facts are undisputed. On October 9, 2012, Frost was brought to Bronx Supreme Court for an attorney visit, and while there he was escorted by correction officers Jemmott and Joye. At some point, Frost said to Jemmott, “I should spit in your fuckin’ face. ” J.A 609:16–17.18 17 The district court also held that Frost failed to create a triable issue with respect to an incident that took place on July 25, 2012, see Frost, 2019 WL 1382323, at *9–10, but Frost does not appeal that ruling. 18 When asked during his deposition whether he had said that he should spit in Jemmott’s face, Frost responded, “I don’t—I don’t recall saying that, but—I never spit in his face, but if I was mad, I possibly did. ” J.A 1552:23–24. On appeal, Frost argues that this equivocal response creates a genuine dispute as to whether he made the comment to Jemmott. We disagree, but for the reasons discussed in the main text, we nevertheless conclude that Frost has created a genuine dispute as to whether Jemmott and Joye used excessive force during the October 9 incident. Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page43 of 57 44 Jemmott then took Frost to the ground, and either Jemmott or Joye kicked Frost in the ribs. Jemmott and Joye also dragged Frost on the ground by his leg shackles, and Frost was later taken to a medical clinic, where he was diagnosed with a ruptured eardrum and bruising on his forehead and cheek. In dismissing Frost’s claim, the district court explained that Frost “had established himself as a violent inmate whose threats against DOC officers needed to be taken seriously. ” Frost v. City of New York, No. 15 Civ. 4843 (NRB), 2019 WL 1382323, at *10 (S.D.N.Y Mar. 27, 2019). And the district court approvingly cited other decisions in which district courts had dismissed excessive force claims brought by inmates who had spit or attempted to spit on correction officers. Id. (citing Coleman v. Hatfield, No. 13-CV-6519-FPG, 2016 WL 2733522 (W.D.N.Y May 10, 2016); Smolen v. Dildine, No. 11-CV-6434-CJS, 2014 WL 3385209 (W.D.N.Y July 9, 2014); Bonet v. Shaw, 669 F. Supp. 2d 300 (W.D.N.Y 2009)). The district court stated, moreover, that Frost had “suffered relatively minor injuries in the course of his struggle with” Jemmott and Joye. Id. at *10 n.28 For these reasons, the district court concluded, Jemmott and Joye “used objectively reasonable force to protect themselves from plaintiff’s threat. ” Id. at *10. Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page44 of 57 45 After reviewing the record below, we respectfully disagree with the district court’s reasoning in several respects. First, we think it is at least questionable at this stage whether Frost’s statement can be characterized as a “threat. ” Notably, Jemmott testified only that Frost said that he “should” spit on Jemmott. J.A 609:16. Although it is possible that this statement would have been interpreted as a threat—that Frost was planning to spit on Jemmott—it is also possible that it would have been interpreted as an insult or an expression of disdain—that Frost wanted to spit on Jemmott, or that he believed he would be justified in spitting on Jemmott. Because we are “required to resolve all ambiguities and draw all permissible factual inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought,” Sec. Ins. Co. of Hartford v. Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc., 391 F.3d 77, 83 (2d Cir. 2004), we must assume at this stage in the litigation that a reasonable officer in Jemmott’s position would have adopted the latter interpretation. For similar reasons, we find the instant case distinguishable from those cited by the district court in which inmates spat or attempted to spit on correction officers.19 During his deposition, Frost categorically denied attempting to spit on 19 The instant case is also distinguishable from Berman v. Williams, No. Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page45 of 57 46 Jemmott. And while defendants argue that “it is undisputed that . . . Frost had ‘bec[o]me combative’ and ‘turned his body towards [Jemmott],’” Appellees’ Br. 45 (quoting J.A 609:15–16) (alterations in original), Frost testified to the contrary that any resistance to Jemmott was caused by physical restraints that limited Frost’s mobility.20 Even assuming, then, that the cases cited by the district court were correctly decided, there is a genuine dispute here as to whether Frost either spat or attempted to spit on Jemmott. 17cv2757 (JGK), 2019 WL 4450810 (S.D.N.Y Sept. 17, 2019). Defendants cite Berman for the proposition that summary judgment is appropriate where officers use force in response to an inmate’s threat to spit. But the court in Berman did not address the merits of the excessive force claim at issue, and it granted summary judgment in favor of defendants only because they were not alleged to have been personally involved in the spitting incident. Id. at *3–5. 20 Defendants argue that Frost is estopped from denying that he threatened Jemmott because Frost pled guilty to creating a disturbance during the October 9 incident. But defendants have put forth no evidence that Frost represented, in connection with his plea, that he had threatened Jemmott. Instead, defendants cite to a portion of Frost’s deposition in which Frost said he believed he had pled guilty to creating a disturbance or refusing a direct order. Notably, Frost also said that he believed he had not pled guilty to assaulting a staff member. And on appeal, Frost points to documents in the record that suggest that he never entered a plea at all in connection with the October 9 incident, but that he was instead found guilty after failing to attend his disciplinary hearing, and that even this finding was later expunged. Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page46 of 57 47 Finally, we differ with the district court’s suggestion that Frost’s injuries were minor. As noted above, Frost was diagnosed not only with multiple facial bruises following the October 9 incident, but also with a ruptured eardrum. Defendants argue that Frost had previously been diagnosed with a ruptured eardrum the year prior and that he therefore failed to show that Jemmott and Joye caused him a new injury. But this is pure speculation, and absent undisputed medical evidence to the contrary—which defendants have not offered—a reasonable jury could find that Jemmott and Joye were responsible for causing a new rupture. We are left, then, with the following question: assuming that a reasonable officer would have interpreted Frost’s spitting statement as an insult rather than a threat, and assuming that Frost was not actively resisting Jemmott and Joye, was it excessive for the officers to tackle, kick, and drag Frost, thereby bruising his face and rupturing his eardrum? We conclude that it was.21 Indeed, while we are 21 In addition to raising the points above, defendants resist this conclusion by arguing that Frost did not sustain significant injuries from being kicked in the ribs or dragged across the floor. But even assuming this is true, the extent of an inmate’s injuries, while relevant to the excessive force inquiry, is not dispositive. Cf. Wilkins v. Gaddy, 559 U.S 34, 38 (2010) (recognizing, in the Eighth Amendment context, that “[a]n inmate who is gratuitously beaten by guards does not lose his ability to pursue an excessive force claim merely because he has the good fortune Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page47 of 57 48 mindful to view the incident with “deference to [the] policies and practices needed to maintain order and institutional security,” Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 135 S. Ct. 2466, 2474 (2015), our caselaw makes clear that it is unconstitutional for officers to strike an individual who is compliant and does not pose an imminent risk of harm to others, see, e.g , Rogoz v. City of Hartford, 796 F.3d 236, 247–48 (2d Cir. 2015) (plaintiff created triable issue regarding excessive force based on evidence that defendant jumped on his back while plaintiff was compliant and lying prone on the ground); Sims v. Artuz, 230 F.3d 14, 22 (2d Cir. 2000) (plaintiff stated claim for excessive force where he alleged, inter alia, that defendants punched him in the face while plaintiff’s arms were shackled); Bellows v. Dainack, 555 F.2d 1105, 1106 & n.1 (2d Cir. 1977) (plaintiff stated claim for excessive force where he alleged that defendant punched him in the ribs while plaintiff was seated in the back of a police car). This is true even where an excessive force plaintiff has a history of aggressive behavior,22 as an alternative rule would place few restrictions on officers’ treatment of individuals with extensive disciplinary records. to escape without serious injury”). 22 It is unclear from the record whether Jemmott and Joye were aware of Frost’s disciplinary history. Although there is evidence that Red ID inmates like Frost sometimes wore identifying restraints, there appears to be no indication as to whether Frost was wearing such restraints on October 9. Jemmott testified Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page48 of 57 49 In reaching this conclusion, we of course take no position on the ultimate issue whether Jemmott and Joye used excessive force in subduing Frost. We hold only that the undisputed facts are insufficient at this stage in the litigation to support a ruling in favor of defendants. Moreover, as just noted, it was clearly established at the time of the incident that an officer could not strike an individual who was compliant and did not pose an imminent risk of harm to others. Because a reasonable jury could find that Frost was neither threatening nor resisting Jemmott and Joye at the time of the incident, summary judgment on defendants’ qualified immunity defense is also unwarranted. See Hemphill v. Schott, 141 F.3d 412, 418 (2d Cir. 1998) (“[S]ummary judgment based either on the merits or on qualified immunity requires that no dispute about material factual issues remain . . . . ”).23 during his deposition, moreover, that he did not recall any previous encounters with Frost. 23 Because we hold that there is a triable issue as to whether Jemmott and Joye used excessive force during the October 9 incident, we do not address the relevance, if any, of Frost’s arguments regarding non-party Correction Officer Williams. Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page49 of 57 50 B. January 16, 2013 Incident Although we conclude that triable issues prevent summary judgment on Frost’s excessive force claim arising out of the October 9 incident, we agree with the district court’s decision to dismiss the claim arising out of the January 16 incident. As noted above, Frost alleges that defendants used excessive force to extract him after he allegedly secreted a weapon in his anal cavity. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants after deciding that video footage of the incident showed that defendants used only reasonable force. See Frost v. City of New York, No. 15 Civ. 4843 (NRB), 2019 WL 1382323, at *11 (S.D.N.Y Mar. 27, 2019). The district court explained, moreover, that Frost suffered de minimis injuries during the extraction. Id. On appeal, Frost argues that the district court erred in its assessment of the record. As a preliminary matter, Frost asserts that there is a dispute as to whether he secreted a weapon in his anal cavity, or whether instead the weapon was planted on him by defendants. Even assuming he did secrete the weapon, Frost contends, defendants used excessive force by continuing to kick and punch him after he had been subdued. Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page50 of 57 51 We disagree with both of these arguments. First, as defendants note, Frost is judicially estopped from denying that he secreted the weapon. “Judicial estoppel prevents a party from asserting a factual position in a legal proceeding that is contrary to a position previously taken by that party in a prior legal proceeding. ” Robinson v. Concentra Health Servs., Inc., 781 F.3d 42, 45 (2d Cir. 2015). Here, Frost was indicted in connection with the January 16 incident, and he pled guilty to promoting prison contraband in the second degree. As part of his allocution, Frost specifically admitted to possessing the weapon, and the court adopted that position in accepting his guilty plea. See Kuar v. Mawn, No. 08-CV-4401 (JFB) (ETB), 2011 WL 838911, at *6 (E.D.N.Y Mar. 4, 2011) (“[U]nder the doctrine of judicial estoppel, the Court will preclude plaintiff from taking factual positions in this case which are directly contrary to statements that he made in connection with his plea and that were adopted by the court which accepted his plea. ”). As a result, Frost cannot now maintain that the weapon was planted on him by defendants. Furthermore, we disagree with Frost’s contention that defendants used excessive force during the extraction. As video footage of the incident makes clear, Frost resisted the officers and tried to prevent them from entering the area where he was located by holding the door shut with his arm. Frost then struggled with Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page51 of 57 52 the officers as they tried to restrain him. Given “the severity of the security problem at issue; the threat reasonably perceived by the officer[s]; and [the fact that Frost] was actively resisting,” Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 135 S. Ct. 2466, 2473 (2015), defendants were justified in using nontrivial amounts of force. And although perhaps the struggle between Frost and the officers could have been gentler, the video footage does not suggest that the officers’ actions could reasonably be viewed as excessive. See Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S 1, 9 (1992) (“Not every push or shove, even if it may later seem unnecessary in the peace of a judge’s chambers, violates a [detainee]’s constitutional rights. ”). Accordingly, we conclude that the district court was correct to dismiss Frost’s claim arising out of the January 16 incident. C. July 16, 2013 Incident Finally, we consider Frost’s excessive force claim arising out of the July 16 incident, during which Frost was extracted from the CPSU recreation yard after he and eighteen other inmates refused to come inside. As with the January 16 incident, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants based on its assessment that Frost’s injuries were minor and that the video footage showed as a matter of law that defendants used reasonable force to extract him. Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page52 of 57 53 Frost v. City of New York, No. 15 Civ. 4843 (NRB), 2019 WL 1382323, at *11 (S.D.N.Y Mar. 27, 2019). After reviewing the footage, we agree with the district court that defendants acted reasonably in restraining Frost initially, but we hold that a triable issue remains as to whether members of the extraction team used excessive force after Frost was subdued. We reject at the outset Frost’s argument that it was inappropriate for defendants to extract him from the recreation yard because he and his fellow inmates were trying to secure a meeting with a senior prison official. It is undisputed that the inmates refused to leave the recreation yard after their allotted hour of recreation time was over. It is also undisputed that the correctional facility is not secure if inmates do not return from the yard. And it is further undisputed that correction officers spent hours trying to convince the inmates to come inside before assembling an extraction team. Given that we “must take account of the legitimate interests in managing a jail, acknowledging as part of the objective reasonableness analysis that deference to policies and practices needed to maintain order and institutional security is appropriate,” Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 135 S. Ct. 2466, 2474 (2015), we conclude that Frost has not created a genuine dispute as to whether extraction was appropriate. Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page53 of 57 54 Furthermore, even if extraction were inappropriate, Frost’s actions justified defendants in using a considerable amount of responsive force. As noted above, video footage of the incident shows that Frost prepared for the extraction team’s arrival by positioning himself in a charging stance and using his ripped clothing as elbow pads and a mouth guard. When the extraction team opened the door to his pen, Frost charged the officers immediately and ended up on top of one of them. And although the officers managed to restrain Frost, they did so only after a vigorous struggle. As with the January 16 incident, this struggle was violent, but we agree with the district court’s assessment that no reasonable jury could find that defendants’ initial use of force was excessive. Frost, 2019 WL 1382323, at *11. We are less sure, however, about the propriety of defendants’ conduct after Frost was subdued. As noted above, it was clearly established at the time of the incident that an officer cannot strike an individual who is compliant and does not pose an imminent risk of harm to others. Cf. Rogoz v. City of Hartford, 796 F.3d 236, 245 (2d Cir. 2015) (“[S]ummary judgment has been found inappropriate in a case involving the use of gratuitous force beyond what was necessary to subdue. ”). Frost argues on appeal that “he was pummeled and kicked after the extraction team subdued him and restrained his legs. ” Appellant’s Br. 47. And although Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page54 of 57 55 defendants deny these allegations, video footage of the July 16 incident appears to show one of the members of the extraction team repeatedly moving his knee toward Frost’s head after Frost was restrained. Moreover, other inmates can be heard in the background yelling for the officer to stop kicking Frost in the head. Based on this footage, we believe that there is a triable issue both as to whether the officer used excessive force and as to whether qualified immunity is warranted. We therefore conclude that the district court erred in dismissing Frost’s claim arising out of the July 16 incident.24 V. Municipal Liability Under the Supreme Court’s decision in Monell v. Department of Social Services, 436 U.S 658 (1978), local governments may be held liable in § 1983 actions. “To establish liability under Monell, a plaintiff must show that he suffered the denial of a constitutional right that was caused by an official municipal policy or custom. ” Bellamy v. City of New York, 914 F.3d 727, 756 (2d Cir. 2019). “Monell does 24 On remand, the district court may be unable to ascertain the identity of the officer in question, or of any other individual defendants who can be held liable in connection with the July 16 incident. See Wright v. Smith, 21 F.3d 496, 501 (2d Cir. 1994) (“It is well settled in this Circuit that personal involvement of defendants in alleged constitutional deprivations is a prerequisite to an award of damages under § 1983. ”). The district court may nevertheless consider evidence regarding the July 16 incident in connection with Frost’s municipal liability claims. Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page55 of 57 56 not provide a separate cause of action for the failure by the government to train its employees; it extends liability to a municipal organization where that organization’s failure to train, or the policies or customs that it has sanctioned, led to an independent constitutional violation. ” Segal v. City of New York, 459 F.3d 207, 219 (2d Cir. 2006). The district court dismissed Frost’s municipal liability claims because it concluded that he had failed to show the existence of any independent constitutional violations. Frost v. City of New York, No. 15 Civ. 4843 (NRB), 2019 WL 1382323, at *12 (S.D.N.Y Mar. 27, 2019). As discussed above, however, we hold that Frost has created a triable issue regarding his due process claim and two of his excessive force claims. Because the district court is best suited to address the merits of Frost’s municipal liability claims in the first instance, we vacate the dismissal of those claims and remand for further consideration in light of this opinion. See Darnell v. Pineiro, 849 F.3d 17, 39 (2d Cir. 2017). CONCLUSION For the reasons above, we AFFIRM the district court’s dismissal of Frost’s malicious prosecution claim and his excessive force claim arising out of the January 16 incident; we REVERSE the district court’s dismissal of Frost’s due Case 19-1163, Document 78-1, 11/12/2020, 2972567, Page56 of 57 57 process claim and his excessive force claims arising out of the October 9 and July 16 incidents; we VACATE the district court’s dismissal of Frost’s municipal liability claims; and we REMAND the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

 BOSTON — Police officers in Massachusetts would have to be certified by the state under a bill filed Wednesday by Gov. Charlie Baker.
The bill would also allow for the decertification of officers who engage in excessive force, and it encourages additional training, including for advanced deescalation techniques.
Massachusetts is one of only a few states without a statewide certification program for law enforcement.
The Republican governor said his administration worked with members of the Massachusetts Black and Latino Legislative Caucus and public safety officials to draft the bill.
Baker said at a press conference that the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis at the hands of police officers made it clear it's ""the time to get this done.” He added that improving law enforcement is only one piece of the process.

LONDON — The governing body of Oxford University’s Oriel College has recommended the removal of a statue of Victorian imperialist Cecil Rhodes that has long been the target of protests.
The college’s governors, made up of faculty, met Wednesday and said they had “voted to launch an independent Commission of Inquiry into the key issues surrounding the Rhodes statue.“
A similar campaign has sought the removal of his statue in Oxford. The movement has gained new momentum since the death of George Floyd spurred anti-racism protests around the world.
Rhodes made a fortune from gold and diamond mines in the late 19th century, with miners laboring in brutal conditions. His statue was removed from the University of Cape Town in South Africa in 2015.

RICHMOND, Va. — A statue of African American tennis star Arthur Ashe has been vandalized.
Photos show the base of the monument tagged with white spray paint and the words “white lives matter” as well as the initials “WLM.” Those initials were later painted over with “BLM,” short for black lives matter.
Richmond Police said they were alerted to the vandalism on Monument Avenue about 10:15 a.m. Wednesday. Police say red paint on the statue itself was already being removed by community members.
Authorities have information on possible suspects and are asking the community to call the Crime Stoppers line if they have information on who was responsible for the vandalism.
The monument was dedicated in 1996 to memorialize the Richmond native, who died in 1993, and to counterbalance the string of statues on Memorial Avenue dedicated to Confederate leaders.

University President Marta Meana says she has had conversations with individuals and stakeholders about how the university can move forward in light of recent events.
The statue is expected to be returned to its donors.

AMSTERDAM — Vandals have daubed red paint and the word “racist” on a statue of Mohandas Gandhi in Amsterdam, amid a wave of attacks on statues around the world of controversial historical figures.
A worker cleaned the statue Wednesday with a high-pressure water hose. Gandhi, widely lauded for his peaceful campaign to win independence for India, has faced criticism for some of his writings about black Africans.
A lawyer, Gandhi traveled to South Africa in 1893 and stayed for two decades, fighting to expand rights for Indians there. He has faced criticism for referring in his writings to black South Africans as backward. However, he later changed his views and supported the rights of black South Africans.
His nonviolent resistance methods have been used in movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.

DETROIT — A white suburban Detroit police chief has been suspended for 30 days without pay and will undergo diversity training for inappropriate social media posts about people protesting the death of George Floyd.
Trustees in Macomb County’s Shelby Township voted 5-2 on Tuesday night on the punishment for chief Robert J. Shelide, who has held the title since 2015.
Shelide, who earlier apologized, told the township board before the vote that he is “not a racist” and “I bleed blue.”
Shelide had been on administrative leave the past two weeks while officials investigated posts on a now-deleted Twitter account. Screenshots posted on Facebook show one tweet spoke about the need to “unleash real cops” and describing protesters as “barbarians” and needing “body bags.“

ATLANTA — Georgia’s lieutenant governor is proposing a version of a hate crimes law for the state.
Republican Geoff Duncan called on lawmakers to create a free-standing hate crime and include more categories of bias crimes. Those would involve people victimized because of their culture and their status in exercising First Amendment rights, including worship, free speech, free press, assembly or petition of government.
A previous effort was found unconstitutional by the state Supreme Court more than a decade ago.
In February, Ahmaud Arbery was shot near Brunswick, Georgia. Investigators have said a white man uttered a racial slur after chasing Arbery down and shooting him.
Georgia’s House passed a simpler measure last year that’s been stalled in a Senate committee for more than year. The bill would add extra penalties onto crimes committed because of someone’s race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, mental disability or physical disability.

GENEVA — The brother of George Floyd has made a heartfelt plea to the U.N.’s top human rights body to launch intense international scrutiny of systemic racism and the killing of unarmed blacks by police.
Philonese Floyd’s message by video to the Human Rights Council came as it contemplates an unprecedented bid sought by the Africa Group to create a Commission of Inquiry — the council’s most powerful tool of scrutiny — to examine and report on racism and violence against protesters by police in the United States.
“I am my brother’s keeper. You in the United Nations are your brothers and sisters’ keepers in America — and you have the power to help us get justice for my brother George Floyd,” Floyd said. “I am asking you to help him. I am asking you to help me. I am asking you to help us: Black people in America.”

HUNTINGTON, W.Va. — The Huntington City Council in West Virginia will vote Wednesday on a proposal to make Juneteenth a permanent city holiday.
The celebration commemorates when enslaved people in Texas learned they were free on June 19, 1865. Huntington Mayor Steve Williams told The Herald-Dispatch he supports the proposal and wants the city’s African American residents to know “the city celebrates Juneteenth with them just as we all celebrate July Fourth together.”
The mayor says the idea for the holiday proposal came from meetings with his diversity advisory committee amid the international protests following the death of George Floyd. Williams expects Wednesday’s meeting will help fast-track the resolution so council members can get it in the books before Friday.
The Emancipation Proclamation was signed by President Abraham Lincoln on Jan. 1, 1863, and freed enslaved people of the rebellion Confederate states.

HOUSTON — Officials say a statue of a Confederate soldier has been removed from a downtown Houston park and a second Confederate statue is expected to be removed soon.
The “Spirit of the Confederacy” statue was removed late Tuesday from Sam Houston Park. Mayor Sylvester Turner said last week the statue will be housed in the Houston Museum of African American Culture.
A second statue, of Confederate artillery commander Richard W. “Dick” Dowling, is also slated for removal. Initially, the Dowling statue was to be moved from Houston’s Hermann Park to the Sabine Pass Battleground State Historical Site near Port Arthur.
But officials say the Dowling statue will instead be placed in a warehouse, at least temporarily, after leaders in Port Arthur expressed opposition.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — A Roman Catholic chaplain at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has resigned at the request of the archdiocese after sending an email suggesting the killing of George Floyd was not an act of racism and he hadn’t lived “a virtuous life.”
The Archdiocese of Boston asked the Rev. Daniel Patrick Moloney to step down June 9 after he sent the message to Catholics at MIT, The Boston Globe reports. A statement from the archdiocese said Moloney’s comments “were wrong and by his resignation he accepts the hurt they have caused.”
The archdiocese learned about the email from Catholics at MIT and alumni. Moloney says he was trying to speak out against “cancel culture” and regrets his message has been misunderstood.
Suzy Nelson, an MIT vice president and dean for student life, sent an email to students calling Moloney’s comments “deeply disturbing” and “Father Moloney’s message failed to acknowledge the dignity of each human being and the devastating impact of systemic racism.”

GENEVA – A U.S. ambassador says the United States is committed to addressing its “shortcomings,” ahead of the U.N. human rights body's discussion of systemic racism and police brutality.
Andrew Bremberg, the U.S. ambassador in Geneva, noted President Donald Trump has condemned the actions of Minneapolis police officers involved in the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man. Trump signed an executive order on police reform on Tuesday.
“The United States recognizes and is committed to addressing its shortcomings, including racial discrimination, and injustices that stem from such discrimination, that persist in our society,” Bremberg said in a statement. “Every democracy faces challenges — the difference is how we deal with them.”
Bremberg says the executive order was “an example of how transparent and responsive our government leaders are in holding violators accountable for their actions and reforming our own system.”
The Human Rights Council in Geneva, following a call by African nations, will discuss “racially inspired human rights violations, systematic racism, police brutality and the violence against peaceful protests.”

NEW ORLEANS — The whereabouts of a statue of a slave owner toppled by protesters in New Orleans and thrown into the Mississippi River remain unknown after a group of men fished the bust out of the water.
A video shows the group using ropes and a plank to carry the paint-splattered bust of John McDonogh out of the river and onto a pickup truck Sunday.
Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s office told The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate the bust is “considered stolen property,” and whoever has it should contact the city regarding its return.
McDonogh left much of his money to New Orleans and Baltimore for schools, and many schools in New Orleans are named after him.
On McDonogh Day each year, schoolchildren from across the city lined up to lay flowers in a racially segregated ceremony. It was boycotted in the 1950s when African-American children would have to wait for hours for white children to lay their flowers first.

RICHMOND, Va. — A statue of African American tennis star Arthur Ashe has been vandalized.
Photos show the base of the monument tagged with white spray paint and the words “white lives matter” as well as the initials “WLM.” Those initials were later painted over with “BLM,” short for black lives matter.
Richmond Police said they were alerted to the vandalism on Monument Avenue about 10:15 a.m. Wednesday. Police say red paint on the statue itself was already being removed by community members.
Authorities have information on possible suspects and are asking the community to call the Crime Stoppers line if they have information on who was responsible for the vandalism.
The monument was dedicated in 1996 to memorialize the Richmond native, who died in 1993, and to counterbalance the string of statues on Memorial Avenue dedicated to Confederate leaders.

NEW YORK — New York’s governor signed an executive order recognizing Juneteenth as a paid holiday for state employees to commemorate the emancipation of slaves in the U.S.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo called it “a day we should all reflect upon” and “a day that is especially relevant in this moment in history. Cuomo said he’ll propose legislation next year making June 19 a permanent state holiday.
President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation was effective Jan. 1, 1863, but the news took time to travel. It wasn’t until June 19, 1865, when word of the proclamation was brought by the Union army to enslaved people in Texas.

AMSTERDAM — Vandals have daubed red paint and the word “racist” on a statue of Mohandas Gandhi in Amsterdam, amid a wave of attacks on statues around the world of controversial historical figures.
A worker cleaned the statue Wednesday with a high-pressure water hose. Gandhi, widely lauded for his peaceful campaign to win independence for India, has faced criticism for some of his writings about black Africans.
A lawyer, Gandhi traveled to South Africa in 1893 and stayed for two decades, fighting to expand rights for Indians there. He has faced criticism for referring in his writings to black South Africans as backward. However, he later changed his views and supported the rights of black South Africans.
His nonviolent resistance methods have been used in movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.

DETROIT — A white suburban Detroit police chief has been suspended for 30 days without pay and will undergo diversity training for inappropriate social media posts about people protesting the death of George Floyd.
Trustees in Macomb County’s Shelby Township voted 5-2 on Tuesday night on the punishment for chief Robert J. Shelide, who has held the title since 2015.
Shelide, who earlier apologized, told the township board before the vote that he is “not a racist” and “I bleed blue.”
Shelide had been on administrative leave the past two weeks while officials investigated posts on a now-deleted Twitter account. Screenshots posted on Facebook show one tweet spoke about the need to “unleash real cops” and describing protesters as “barbarians” and needing “body bags.“

PORTLAND, Ore. — Police say a man drove his car into a crowd of protesters early Wednesday in downtown Portland, injuring three people.
Police say the 27-year-old male driver drove away “at a high rate of speed,” but was tracked and arrested on suspicion of hit and run, reckless driving and possession of a controlled substance, according to The Oregonian/OregonLive.
Two people were taken by ambulance to a hospital. Another was taken for treatment in a personal car. Police say none of the injuries were life-threatening.

ATLANTA — Georgia’s lieutenant governor is proposing a version of a hate crimes law for the state.
Republican Geoff Duncan called on lawmakers to create a free-standing hate crime and include more categories of bias crimes. Those would involve people victimized because of their culture and their status in exercising First Amendment rights, including worship, free speech, free press, assembly or petition of government.
A previous effort was found unconstitutional by the state Supreme Court more than a decade ago.
In February, Ahmaud Arbery was shot near Brunswick, Georgia. Investigators have said a white man uttered a racial slur after chasing Arbery down and shooting him.
Georgia’s House passed a simpler measure last year that’s been stalled in a Senate committee for more than year. The bill would add extra penalties onto crimes committed because of someone’s race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, mental disability or physical disability.

GENEVA — The brother of George Floyd has made a heartfelt plea to the U.N.’s top human rights body to launch intense international scrutiny of systemic racism and the killing of unarmed blacks by police.
Philonese Floyd’s message by video to the Human Rights Council came as it contemplates an unprecedented bid sought by the Africa Group to create a Commission of Inquiry — the council’s most powerful tool of scrutiny — to examine and report on racism and violence against protesters by police in the United States.
“I am my brother’s keeper. You in the United Nations are your brothers and sisters’ keepers in America — and you have the power to help us get justice for my brother George Floyd,” Floyd said. “I am asking you to help him. I am asking you to help me. I am asking you to help us: Black people in America.”

HUNTINGTON, W.Va. — The Huntington City Council in West Virginia will vote Wednesday on a proposal to make Juneteenth a permanent city holiday.
The celebration commemorates when enslaved people in Texas learned they were free on June 19, 1865. Huntington Mayor Steve Williams told The Herald-Dispatch he supports the proposal and wants the city’s African American residents to know “the city celebrates Juneteenth with them just as we all celebrate July Fourth together.”
The mayor says the idea for the holiday proposal came from meetings with his diversity advisory committee amid the international protests following the death of George Floyd. Williams expects Wednesday’s meeting will help fast-track the resolution so council members can get it in the books before Friday.
The Emancipation Proclamation was signed by President Abraham Lincoln on Jan. 1, 1863, and freed enslaved people of the rebellion Confederate states.

HOUSTON — Officials say a statue of a Confederate soldier has been removed from a downtown Houston park and a second Confederate statue is expected to be removed soon.
The “Spirit of the Confederacy” statue was removed late Tuesday from Sam Houston Park. Mayor Sylvester Turner said last week the statue will be housed in the Houston Museum of African American Culture.
A second statue, of Confederate artillery commander Richard W. “Dick” Dowling, is also slated for removal. Initially, the Dowling statue was to be moved from Houston’s Hermann Park to the Sabine Pass Battleground State Historical Site near Port Arthur.
But officials say the Dowling statue will instead be placed in a warehouse, at least temporarily, after leaders in Port Arthur expressed opposition.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — A Roman Catholic chaplain at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has resigned at the request of the archdiocese after sending an email suggesting the killing of George Floyd was not an act of racism and he hadn’t lived “a virtuous life.”
The Archdiocese of Boston asked the Rev. Daniel Patrick Moloney to step down June 9 after he sent the message to Catholics at MIT, The Boston Globe reports. A statement from the archdiocese said Moloney’s comments “were wrong and by his resignation he accepts the hurt they have caused.”
The archdiocese learned about the email from Catholics at MIT and alumni. Moloney says he was trying to speak out against “cancel culture” and regrets his message has been misunderstood.
Suzy Nelson, an MIT vice president and dean for student life, sent an email to students calling Moloney’s comments “deeply disturbing” and “Father Moloney’s message failed to acknowledge the dignity of each human being and the devastating impact of systemic racism.”

RICHMOND, Va. — Demonstrators in Richmond tore down another Confederate statue on Tuesday night.
The Howitzers Monument located near Virginia Commonwealth University’s Monroe Park campus was toppled after protesters spent the night marching in the rain and used a rope to pull it down from its pedestal.
A video from the Richmond Times-Dispatch shows the paint-splattered statue on the ground as the rain continued overnight in Virginia’s capital city.
It’s the third Confederate statue, and the fourth monument, to be torn down in Virginia since international protests erupted following the death of George Floyd by a white Minneapolis police officer who pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck.
Statues of Confederate president Jefferson Davis, Confederate Gen. Williams Carter Wickham as well as Christopher Columbus were toppled.
The protesters in Richmond started their march Tuesday night advocating for the removal of all Confederate statues, establishing a civilian policing review board and defunding the police, among other things.
The Howitzers Monument, showed a Confederate artilleryman standing in front of a gun, was erected in 1892 to memorialize the city’s Civil War artillery unit, according to the Encyclopedia of Virginia.

PORTLAND, Ore. — At least two Portland-based reporters have been hurt in recent days while covering protests against police brutality.
Oregon Public Broadcasting reports Oregonian journalist Beth Nakamura recounted being slammed by a baton. Portland Tribune reporter Zane Sparling said he was shoved into a wall by a police officer and hit by a crowd control munition.
The reporters say they identified themselves to police as press. In both incidents, the reporters were told by police, in what the journalists described as profanity-laced responses, that their press credentials did not matter.
Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler said on Twitter they were alarming incidents that need to be addressed.
Police spokesperson Lt. Tina Jones says they continue to work with media partners about the importance of following lawful orders so they can stay safe and avoid arrest or altercation.
However, members of the media have a fundamental right to do their jobs during demonstrations.

ATLANTA — The police officer who fatally shot Rayshard Brooks in the back after the fleeing man pointed a stun gun in his direction is going to be charged with felony murder and 10 other crimes.
Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard made the announcement about Garrett Rolfe during a news conference Wednesday.
Howard said Rolfe kicked Brooks while he lay on the ground and that the officer with him, Devin Brosnan, stood on Brooks’ shoulder as he struggled for life Friday night.
Rolfe had already been fired after he fatally shot the 27-year-old Brooks. Brosnan had been put on administrative leave.
Brosnan is being charged with aggravated assault and other crimes. The shooting had sparked new demonstrations in Georgia’s capital against police brutality.

 BOSTON — Police officers in Massachusetts would have to be certified by the state under a bill filed Wednesday by Gov. Charlie Baker.
The bill would also allow for the decertification of officers who engage in excessive force, and it encourages additional training, including for advanced deescalation techniques.
Massachusetts is one of only a few states without a statewide certification program for law enforcement.
The Republican governor said his administration worked with members of the Massachusetts Black and Latino Legislative Caucus and public safety officials to draft the bill.
Baker said at a press conference that the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis at the hands of police officers made it clear it's ""the time to get this done.” He added that improving law enforcement is only one piece of the process.

LONDON — The governing body of Oxford University’s Oriel College has recommended the removal of a statue of Victorian imperialist Cecil Rhodes that has long been the target of protests.
The college’s governors, made up of faculty, met Wednesday and said they had “voted to launch an independent Commission of Inquiry into the key issues surrounding the Rhodes statue.“
A similar campaign has sought the removal of his statue in Oxford. The movement has gained new momentum since the death of George Floyd spurred anti-racism protests around the world.
Rhodes made a fortune from gold and diamond mines in the late 19th century, with miners laboring in brutal conditions. His statue was removed from the University of Cape Town in South Africa in 2015.

This study gathered 197 participants, interviewed within 48 hours of being victims of Hate Crime. This immediate follow-up should ensure accurate responses. The responses of the victims were compared to that of 113 Welsh front-line staff who respond to and support such victims. The barriers to reporting are found to be broadly similar with the findings of other UK studies. A considerable difference in understanding of the barriers to reporting hate crime was found between the victims and support services. The main reason given for non-reporting was common: the poor service, attitude and treatment from the police.
FULL TEXT
Introduction
This article will compare the findings of a study in Wales using Victim Support data with others from across the UK and will attempt to compare and contrast the findings, specifically looking at barriers to reporting identified by both victims of Hate Crime and frontline service providers across Wales. Service providers contributing to the research are from local authorities, the NHS, the police, housing associations, the probation service, the Crown Prosecution Service and third-sector organisations such as race equality councils, Citizens Advice and voluntary groups. This comparison will be contextualised within the regional and national policies adopted to prevent and support victims of hate crime and the Seven Key Decision Points in recognising and reporting hate crime, established by McDevitt et al. (2000). Hate Crime, Hate Incident, Bias Crime and Prejudicial Discrimination are all phrases associated with the classification of acts that target a victim for an aspect of their identity. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in England and Wales (2018) have outlined that race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity and disability are the protected characteristics for hate crime. 
There are two main aspects required in the legislation: first, that the act was a criminal offence, regardless of the motivation of the offender; second, that the act must have in part been committed and motivated out of prejudice towards the victim as a result of their protected characteristic. However, the hostility expressed by the perpetrator can be in many forms and the CPS and courts do not define this but ‘use the everyday understanding of the word which includes ill-will, spite, contempt, prejudice, unfriendliness, antagonism, resentment and dislike’ (CPS, 2018: 1). Thus the total definition of such an act is complex, subjective and potentially confusing, including establishing if the incident is a crime or not in its own right without the perceived hate elements.
The Welsh context
The Welsh Government established a Framework for Action to eliminate hostility and prejudice and to focus on early prevention to stop incidents escalating into crimes. This is supported by three strategies, prevention, supporting victims and improving multi-agency response, each with specific deliverables such as tackling hate-related bullying and promoting respect and delivering training and awareness in service delivery, for example specifying teacher education within this area within Wales and improving reporting rates (Welsh Government, 2018). As will be seen throughout this article the need for a fuller awareness by both victims and within the support services is crucial. The Welsh Government also works with the UK Government’s action plan Challenge It, Report It, Stop It! in non-devolved areas (Welsh Government, 2018). Following both national policy and the Welsh focus on multiagency working, third-party reporting schemes are used. Online systems are in place to report hate crime, that are heavily promoted by lobbying, and community interest groups through the internet and social media, such as Tell Mama, Stonewall, Stop Hate UK, Victim Support, in addition to the Home Office scheme True Vision and in Wales Victim Support Cymru.
The indicator most utilised for understanding rates of hate crime are the incidents reported to the police, who then refer them on to various other agencies for information and action. The situation within Wales is that victims of hate crime can report the occurrences directly to the police primarily using the 101 or 999 telephone numbers or other methods. Victims have the option of submitting a report online directly to the police through ‘True Vision’, the England and Wales third-party reporting website. Victims may also report directly to Victim Support Cymru, commissioned by the Welsh Government to support victims of hate within Wales and comprise the National Hate Crime Report and Support Centre Wales. The recording system in use in Wales means that when an incident is reported to the police, victim crime data is transferred automatically from the four Welsh police services using a data sharing agreement which is confidential, and involves anonymised data being analysed by the Welsh National Hate Crime Report and Support Centre.
The Welsh Government framework recognises that hate crime is underreported and aims to encourage increased reporting. This is in line with the UK in general, for example True Vision (2016), shows that in Wales there has been an increase of online reports of hate crime through the online mechanism, rising from 31 reports made in 2012/2013 to 120 reports made in 2015/2016. However, Torfaen People First (2012) documented that third-party reporting centres are effective in raising awareness of the issue, but are primarily based in settings, where opportunities to report such incidents already exist: For example, day opportunity centres, community education establishments or services focused upon protection of vulnerable adults. Consequently, the general community continues to have limited knowledge that the third party reporting centres exist. Despite the provision of online reporting, this lack of awareness is a national phenomenon as shown by Police Scotland who on the 17 March 2018 launched a major campaign to increase the awareness amongst potential perpetrators on the impact hate crime has upon victims and consider the damage caused by abuse related to hatred. This campaign was launched as a result of an increase of online reports of hate crime received by Scotland police. Assistant Chief Constable Gillian MacDonald states that, ‘We are aware that hate crime is often under-reported, however, Police Scotland is committed to reviewing and fully investigating all reports of hate.’ What then causes hate crime to be under-reported?
This article is part of an ongoing study into the reporting behaviour of victims in Wales that seeks to understand the complexities faced by victims when choosing to report a hate crime. Having a greater understanding of what motivates a victim of hate crime in Wales to report it, and their rationale for doing so or not reporting, will have a significant impact on the way the police in Wales coordinate activities to improve reporting and target interventions and crime reduction activities.
Barriers to reporting
Accurate identification of hate crimes and overcoming barriers that exist can be analysed using the Seven Key Decision Points (SKDP) as outlined by McDevitt et al. (2000). First, the victim needs to acknowledge that a crime has been committed, and second, the victim must have some perception that the crime may have been motivated by a bias towards them. Third, the matter must be reported to the police by the victim or another party, and fourth, the motivation behind the crime must be brought to the police’s attention. Fifth, the police need to acknowledge and recognise that a bias may have contributed to the motivation, and a sixth potential barrier is that the crime must be documented as a hate crime during the investigation. The last is that the hate crime when finalised must be accurately recorded as such. This section will explore some of the factors influencing each of these decision points and outline the ways in which actions and perceptions at these decision points may erect a barrier to reporting hate crimes and recording them accurately.
Victim perceptions and steps one to four in the SKDP
Victim perception is an important element in the SKDP process: whether the victim sees an incident as a crime, how serious a crime it is and whether they are aware of the hate element within the crime. It may be that victims are subjective when considering if they are victims and this may influence reporting rates. Gottfredson and Gottfredson (1988) identified the role of the victim in reporting based on the victim choices, and Bachman and Coker (1995) demonstrated that reporting behaviours can be linked to how serious the victim perceives the crime to be, with perceived lower-level crimes not being reported. This prompts the question as to where on a scale a victim would place the behaviour before they report as outlined with Allport (1979) considering the idea of ‘extermination’ compared to ‘spoken abuse’ on a five-scale basis. Christmann and Wong (2010) considered individual decision making on the reporting of hate crime based on what resources were available to influence these decisions. These findings demonstrated that victims had a lesser likelihood of making a full report to the police if the incident was non-criminal, as they perceived that the response would not be taken as seriously by the police. With this in mind, David (2000) concluded that if the victim’s perspectives were amended so that self-awareness was increased regarding the issue and the understanding of their needs was highlighted, then reporting behaviour would be increased. Williams and Tregidga (2013) in a study in Wales also found that victims prioritised reporting based on a perception of severity and, furthermore, it extended the decision-making rationale to include if the problem was an isolated incident or an escalating issue. An additional factor highlighted by Wickes et al. (2016) amongst the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) community, is that for some victims, they do not view themselves as a victim of hate crime, merely a victim of crime. Chakraborti et al. (2014) suggests that this lack of awareness of the victim as to what a hate crime is reduces reporting behaviour and that only the more violent acts are reported, such as assaults. This assessment was also documented by Williams and Tregidga (2013), where less serious crimes were seen to go unreported or, as Harlow (2005) suggests, that the matter had been dealt with in another way. Browne et al. (2011) found that avoidance, and remaining in shared social circles, were some responses employed by victims, because of abuse becoming normalised, suggesting that front-line service provision have failed.
A second important victim perception is how the police respond to reporting a hate crime. Balboni and McDevitt (2001) found that where confidence was high between minority groups and the police, hate crime reporting would be increased from these groups, especially where the police had a diverse workforce representing different strands of the community to which they serve. This idea conforms to the concept of ‘procedural justice’ wherein communities engage with the police if they think that they are fair, equitable and respectful (Sunshine and Tyler, 2003).
 Marshall and Webb (1995) considered reported crime rates amongst minority communities and have outlined that minority communities are less likely to consider reporting crime to the police. Terrill et al. (2003) claim this to be a result of negative perceptions of interactions with the police. These perceptions are emphasised through police approaches to arrests and stop-searches when drugs are a factor (Beckett et al., 2006), whereby it is felt that racial minorities are unfairly targeted and are dealt with more vigorously.
 Zaykowski (2010) found that generally minority victims reported less and Harlow (2005) has attempted to link reporting rates to the relationship of the victim and offender and makes the point that over half of crimes committed against victims are carried out by unknown offenders. Herek et al. (1999) demonstrated, despite suggestions that gay victims being more likely to report hate crimes, that overall reporting rates for crimes against gay victims are lower than for non-gay victims. This, they claim, is based on a perception regarding police treatment and the response they would receive based on their sexual orientation. Furthermore, Herek et al. (1999) found when gay victims have a low perception of police response, this reduces the likelihood of reporting the matter. This type of barrier has been coined ‘secondary victimisation’ by Nolan and Akiyama (1999), who believe that victims of anti-gay crime fear citing examples of insensitivity and abuse by police (NYCGL Anti-Violence Project, 1995). Miles-Johnson (2013) considered the Theory of Planned Behaviour (Ajzen, 1985), which is used to link attitudes and beliefs to intention and behaviour, and applied it to measure the willingness of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) victims or persons to report crime to the police in comparison to the wider community. The research showed that LGBTI participants are less likely to report crime to the police because of having a belief that the police are homophobic (Wickes et al., 2016), and reporting rates amongst that group will not improve until these perceptions are positively altered.
An additional factor that hinders reporting is that the victim may fear being stigmatised. Wickes et al. (2016) highlighted that some LGBTI victims, having not identified their sexuality or identity to family, therefore do not have the option available to report a hate crime. These negative perceptions and low confidence in the police have inevitably resulted in an under-reporting of LGBTI crimes to the police (Chakraborti, 2009).
 Saxton et al. (2001) found people with disabilities felt that the police will not believe them and not investigate the matter fully, resulting in greater burdens of stress upon the victim with a disability. Milliner (2014) found in South Wales that some people with learning difficulties were afraid of the uniform and could not approach officers as it was too daunting, and that some would prefer to report via a support worker. She found that others would not even report to their social worker in case they were deemed to be unable to cope and might be further institutionalised. Whereas Sobsey (1994) believes that language and communication barriers exist when people with a disability look to report crimes, which result in less detail being obtained about an incident, which would reduce the likelihood of a remedy being enforced. Milliner (2014) found cases where the victims stated that they were ‘told off’ for reporting incidents. Wickes et al. (2016) looked at language barriers that existed from the authority’s perspective and found that there was a greater need for more inclusive and enabling language around hate crime, to assist in the increasing of hate crime reporting levels, which has also been documented by Langton and Planty (2011).
In a study carried out by the Leicester University Hate Crime Project Chakraborti et al. (2014) participants predominantly outlined that they would not report the matter due to a perception in that the police would not take it seriously or not do anything to resolve the issue. This was also evidenced in an all-Wales-based study (Williams and Tregidga, 2013), which highlighted the same victim perceptions regarding not reporting.
Similarly, Saxton et al. (2001) and Milliner (2014) found that people with disabilities also believed that the police will not believe them and not investigate the matter fully, resulting in greater burdens of stress upon the victim with a disability. This lack of action by the police may also lead to more exposure to retaliation by the criminal. The victim may also hold a perception that rather than dealing with the matter as a criminal investigation, that the police would notify social services. Child et al. (2010) states that previous experiences have influenced the reporting rationale and behaviour of a victim with a disability negatively, and suggested that other victims have not reported, as they do not want to be viewed socially as having a disability. A further barrier may be that some people with a disability believe that to report such abuse is a negative trait and that it is more acceptable for the victim to ignore crimes against them rather than be viewed as a complainer by society (Carlson, 1997).
If victims do not feel that support services can resolve the matter and protect them then they are unlikely to report hate crime. Cantos (2006) documents how victims with a disability feel powerless as victims in a hate crime situation and misperceive that suffering violent encounters are their fault. It could be considered that the more socially isolated the victim living with a disability is, the more likely they are to have a feeling of personal powerlessness, which increases their fear that to report the matter may lead to retaliation by the offender (Petersilia et al., 2001). Fear of retaliation may in some circumstances have a greater meaning, where a victim living with a disability relies upon the offender for care or support due to a disability. This fear may manifest itself as losing independence, or day-to-day functions such as personal hygiene and money management (Petersilia et al., 2001, Andrews and Veronen, 1993). Several studies demonstrated that for some victims, the fear or retaliation hinders the decision to report a hate crime (Chakraborti et al., 2014; Wickes et al., 2016; Wong and Christmann, 2008).
It is therefore clear that fair treatment of victims is required whereby the police validate the victim experiences, which in turn allows victims to feel empowered and able to gain some closure over the incident (Bradford et al., 2013), and by doing so increase reporting behaviour (Sargeant et al., 2014). This is the main element of procedural justice, but more is needed. The victim must have confidence that some meaningful action will be taken and that this will result in fewer hate incidents if victims report more. So, contrary to Hough et al. (2010), efficiency and effectiveness are important factors to increase a victim’s engagement, reporting and support for the police and criminal justice service. This perception may have increased since the Welsh survey following a media campaign in late 2018 (e.g., Wild West Britain out of Control, Daily Mail headline, 2 November 2018) exposing the higher demand on the police service coupled with the reduced number of police officers following 10 years of austerity (Daily Express, 2018). A survey in November 2018 found that 55% of respondents were more concerned about being a victim of crime than they were a year ago (Survation, 2018).
Accurate police identification steps five to seven in the SKDP
 Wickes et al. (2016) states that the police are not always able to identify accurately when a hate crime is taking place. The misidentification of hate crimes by police has been raised previously by McDevitt (1987) and Levin (1992), with some examples citing an unwillingness by the police to raise the profile of a minor case through labelling it as a hate crime, as the investigation may become too burdensome or sensationalise the crime reported. There is also the issue that hate crimes require an assessment of all factors that contribute to the crime to be weighed up and at times this can be subjective, in turn leading to a unique set of issues when attempting to accurately record them (Nolan and Akiyama, 1999), whereas other examples suggested that police officers held the opinion that all crimes of a similar level of severity should be treated equally, and not on the basis of motive (Nolan and Akiyama, 1999). It is this ‘organisational conditioning’ outlined by Levin (1992) that seeks to inhibit the understanding and importance of hate crimes from a community-wide perspective. Assessing the issues that lead to classification errors is particularly important as it ultimately influences the accuracy of National Crime Figures as far as hate crimes are concerned (Nolan et al., 2011). Nolan et al. (2015) demonstrates that the under-counting of hate crimes within official figures was the largest barrier surrounding the accurate picture of hate crime. This has been exacerbated through a plethora of interpretations of the definition of hate crime and how it should be applied not only by victims, but predominantly by different police force areas and organisations and the officers responsible for investigating them.
A focus on the agenda appears to be key also, as Clayton et al. (2016) found that levels of reporting of hate crimes had reduced in line with reduced prioritisation and resourcing. The retrenchment from reduction in resourcing and different typologies of neighbourhood policing (Higgins, 2017) suggests that police officers are more likely to be ‘strangers in uniform’ (Milliner, 2014) and have less time to build up a picture of minor incidents escalating to serious hate crimes. The Welsh government is committed to the continuation of Community Support Officers via ring-fenced funding to maintain CSO numbers within neighbourhood policing teams. Unfortunately, a discussion on the future of neighbourhood policing, which the authors feel to be a major element in recognising and supporting victims, is beyond the scope of this article. However, the balance between reactive and preventative policing is a major question for the police service, as is whether the recent signal from the UK government to increase policing budgets (Knowles, 2018) will be sufficient to halt the retrenchment away from neighbourhood policing.
The Welsh study
Service providers survey
As part of the Welsh government’s framework for action on hate crime, training sessions were delivered to 24 groups with 113 participants from across service providers operating in Wales, between November 2014 and March 2015, which included housing, local authorities, police services, Crown Prosecution Service, the probation service, the National Health Service, Citizens Advice and the voluntary sector. Although all service providers were experienced practitioners, a one-hour awareness session on hate crime to ensure that each participant was fully aware of the term and its legal definition (an overview of s. 145 and 146 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003) was given immediately before the focus groups, including an explanation of each of the five protected characteristics covered by the definition of hate crime, in addition to a hate crime case study for each of the five protected characteristics. These comprised: Brent Martin targeted for having a disability, Jonny Delany targeted and murdered for being a Gypsy Traveller, Lee Rigby murdered by al Qaeda-influenced individuals, Jodi Dobrowski murdered for being perceived as gay and Dee Jenkins targeted for gender transitioning from male to female. Participants also received five case studies, anonymised referrals into the National Hate Crime Report and Support Centre Wales (one per protected characteristic covered by the hate crime definition).
This provided potential respondents for a study with a consistent level of knowledge. From this, 24 focus groups were coordinated, with 113 participants providing consent to utilise their responses, to identify how front-line services within Wales perceived the way in which victims report hate crime and use their experience as a front-line service to suggest why victims do not report. Essentially this data represents the Welsh front-line service position on perceived barriers of reporting hate and suggestions on how to remove such barriers.
Participants had 10 minutes to discuss with other participants within the focus group what barriers they believe may exist that prevent a victim of hate crime reporting the occurrence to a front-line or emergency service. The participants were then asked to provide their responses verbally; these were written on a flipchart visible to the participants at the front of the room. Once all of the responses were clearly displayed on the flipchart, the participants were given a further 10 minutes to discuss ways in which these barriers could be removed or mitigated to enable a victim to report a hate crime. Participants then gave their responses verbally when prompted against each barrier previously identified, and these were recorded on the flipchart accordingly. An independent person (GC) ran the focus groups as All Wales Hate Crime Manager to try to remove any fear of any individual’s comments or attitudes being fed back into their organisation. The aim was for open discussion, but the authors acknowledge that focus groups may limit individuals’ truthfulness and full participation by all members.
Victims survey
Victim Support Cymru (VSC) collects data routinely, and a victim’s data and experience are transferred automatically between the four police forces in Wales and VSC. There is a clear service-level agreement in place for the process, and it is inclusive of implied consent for the victim to be contacted. The victim is therefore automatically opted in, both to be contacted for an offer of support services and for this research to be carried out using their data, unless they request to opt out.
Under this arrangement a series of seven questions were formulated to identify the reporting rationale of victims of hate crime. To ensure the most immediate response from the victim to encapsulate the raw emotion and feelings, thereby generating a more genuine emotional response, the questions were asked at the point of initial contact with the victim, which is within 48 hours of reporting the crime. Asking at initial contact also ensures the welfare of the victim, as they are provided with immediate emotional support to help them overcome the crime and a needs assessment is carried out to see what additional support they may require. The operators whom carry out the initial contact are trained in hate crime and only contact such victims. The questions were fully explained to the staff and they were supervised during the calls to ensure data quality and consistency was maintained. Victims were informed that they can opt out at any time and a unique reference number was created to ensure that the responses recorded were anonymous. The responses were entered into an Excel document and grouped into categories with the most appropriate heading.
This is a sensitive issue, and victims contacted within 48 hours of an incident may not want to reveal fully all their thoughts and feelings. Thus it may be that some victims did not fully engage in their responses. Furthermore, this data is from those who have reported, as this methodology does not reach non-reporting victims. Nonetheless, lessons can be learned from these respondents. The short time-lapse between incident and interview should provide a fuller, richer and more accurate recall and hence should remove some memory/recall inaccuracies that might be associated with annual surveys such as the CSEW.
A comparison of motivating factors between England and Wales
The distribution of reasons for hate crimes in Wales is different to that in England: Table 1 shows a higher percentage based upon the protected characteristics of both sexual orientation and disability and lower percentages for both race and religion. As discussed above, reporting barriers may be different for each of these categories. Disability hate crime is particularly more frequent in the Welsh survey, and in all surveys racial hate crime is dominant.

 Cuerden and Rogers (2015) found that males are almost twice as likely to report hate crime. In terms of age profile, the ages that range between 16 and 45 have the highest levels of reporting, accounting for 64% of the sample, with the greatest concentration stemming from the 26 to 35 age range (24.3%).
It is worth noting that the 16 to 25 age range has the second highest level of reporting (18.1%). This, Cuerden and Rogers (2015) suggest, may be due to awareness-type education in schools and colleges, which has been commonly seen across Wales since the implementation of the Welsh Government Hate Crime Framework. A recent ‘Resilience’ intervention, funded by the Welsh government, has started to further promote diversity and ethics within Welsh schools. Alternatively, this age group may experience higher rates of hate crimes, with 90% of Scottish children with learning difficulties experiencing bullying at school (Enable Scotland, 2017).
Comparisons of victims and service providers perceptions
Data obtained from VSC between 18 August 2015 and 26 September 2016 gathered 197 consenting victims of hate crime. Due to some participants providing multiple responses, it should be noted that there was a total of 209 victim responses within Table 2 and 206 victim responses in Table 3. Tables 2 and 3 contrast the views of the 113 service providers with those of hate crime reporting victims.

This mapping is based upon the authors’ understanding of the sentiments expressed by the two groups.
The seriousness of the crime may also affect the reporting rate. Corcoran et al. (2015) found that overall, 48% of hate crime incidents were reported to the police, and that this was similar to the proportion of hate crimes in previous CSEW surveys. This is a higher figure than for overall CSEW crime in the same time periods, which was 40%. Corcoran et al. (2015) suggest that this is due to different patterns of seriousness of hate crimes compared to crime overall; for example, violent crime in general has higher reporting rates and this is a higher proportion of hate crimes reported (49% of hate compared 19% of overall CSEW crime). Supporting this relationship, it is found that reporting to the police for theft incidents overall is a lower figure (40%). A very similar pattern was found in this Welsh survey of victims where, Assault Occasioning Bodily Harm was experienced in 48% of the crimes, followed by harassment (29%) and public order offences (16%). These higher reported rates of hate violence may reflect the earlier findings that violent crime is more likely to be reported or that victims of hate crime are more likely to suffer violence within hate crimes. Until the reporting rate for hate crime improves, this question cannot be determined.
As can be seen clearly in Table 2, the main barrier for victims is the ‘police’ which makes up 33.5% of the total responses. This category encapsulated feelings that to report an issue would be ‘a waste of police time’; that the ‘Police won’t do anything’; ‘the police do not take the matter seriously’; ‘a poor police service has been received previously’; that ‘nothing will get done’ and that there are ‘bad relations with the police’. This can be compared with other studies in Table 2, which also show this category to be the main barrier to reporting in other UK studies.
 Corcoran et al. (2015) found from the combined 2012/13 to 2014/15 CSEW surveys, that 52% of hate crime victims were very or fairly satisfied with how the police handled their report, a lower rate than for victims of crime overall (73% very or fairly satisfied). Conversely, hate crime victims had a higher rate of being very dissatisfied (35%) with the police handling their case than the overall victim response in the CSEW (14%). This may again be partially related to a different pattern of crimes committed to hate crime victims, as discussed above. Corcoran et al. (2015) compared satisfaction of victims of violent hate crime with the police (46% were very or fairly satisfied) to that of victims of overall violent crime incidents (68%), showing a considerably lower level of satisfaction. However, they do point out that the violent hate crime responses are from a relatively small dataset.
 Corcoran et al. (2015: 22) also found from the combined 2012/13 to 2014/15 surveys that: victims of hate crime were less likely to think the police had treated them fairly or with respect, compared with victims of CSEW crime overall. For example, in 59 per cent of hate crime incidents the victims thought the police treated them fairly, compared with 81 per cent of incidents of CSEW crime overall. Similarly, in 79 per cent of incidents of hate crime, victims thought the police treated them with respect, compared with 89 per cent of incidents of CSEW crime overall. Thus the findings in this study agree with those of previous studies that show that hate crime victims find that the police response is poor and in need of major improvement.
Equally worryingly, 14.8% of the victims feel that hate crimes have become a normalised part of life and that, as such, to report them would mean nothing, as they occur so frequently. Again, the comparisons show that this is an important factor in the other UK studies. The Suffolk Hate Crime Survey in 2012 found a very similar rate, and these are both considerably higher than that found in the earlier CSEW (Table 2). This increase may be due to time, a motivating factor of regional/cultural differences.
Furthermore, hate crime victims have been found to be more negatively affected by the crime experienced than is generally the case, with Corcoran et al. (2015) reporting that victims of hate crime more frequently stated that they were emotionally affected by the incident (92% and 81% respectively) and also responded as ‘very much’ affected at a considerably higher rate (36% and 13% respectively). This analysis also suggests that this higher level of emotional impact is not due to the type of hate crimes experienced, as victims of violent crime tend to be less likely to say they were emotionally affected than victims of other crime types.
Fear of reprisal may be increasing over time, with response rates of 3.6% in 2009–2011 (CSEW) 9.9% in 2012 (Suffolk) and 17.7% in 2016 (Wales), unless the crime type mapping proposed within Table 2 is too compartmentalised, with ‘Afraid’ and ‘Private issue dealt with ourselves’ also being to avoid reprisal and hence overlapping with ‘Repercussions’. If this is the case, the trend is fairly constant across time. with values of 17.1% in 2009–2011 (CSEW) 15.5% in 2012 (Suffolk) but 33.5% in 2016 (Wales) perhaps showing a regional or motivating factor (particular type of hate) variation in the Welsh response.
Other factors, such as fear of reporting itself, continue to present themselves as barriers. However, there are more intricate examples provided, such as a ‘fuelling of the issue by the media’ and that the process from reporting to desired outcome seems ‘too slow’, perhaps an indicator of changes in standards expected or a torch-light on an ever-criticised area of policing. As discussed above, the level of police funding and changing emphasis on preventive policing may be important factors in supporting victims and reporting rates. In a recent Survation survey, 81% of respondents favoured increasing police officer numbers, reflecting the greater fear of crime found in the survey. This in turn may lead to lower reporting rates as the media emphasises the lack of police capacity to attend all reported crime.
A small percentage (2.4%) state that feelings of being ashamed are causing an inhibition to report, prompting questions as to whether social change is what is really needed to facilitate true cohesion and understanding to the complexities contained within crimes of bias and prejudice. This factor was not revealed within the earlier studies, although inhibitions due to cultural norms in specific groups such as the Gypsy and Traveller community, the Chinese community and the Polish community have been identified (Wong et al., 2013).
Welsh service providers gave the same main reason for non-reporting by victims of hate crime – that of poor police response, including all the factors mentioned earlier, such as not being believed, poor relations and lack of trust with the police, lack of action by the police etc. However, Welsh service providers had a much higher belief that ‘fear’ and ‘shame’ were barriers than the victims’ responses (e.g. Fear 27.5% vs 15.8%). Furthermore, they had a response of 7.4% around communication barriers and not knowing how to report, a level which is not revealed in any of the other three victim surveys in Table 2. Furthermore, despite the higher frequency of disability hate crime within the Welsh sample, only 1% of the victims gave this reason. This may be because those with communication barriers under-report, relative to those not experiencing such a barrier, or that service providers are out of tune with victims’ feelings. Overall, there is a considerable mismatch between victims’ and providers’ beliefs within Wales.
When Welsh service providers were asked how such perceived barriers may be removed, as shown in Table 3, providers suggest that to ‘market support’ and to ‘make staff aware of procedures’ are the most prevalent concepts. A further suggestion, to ‘explain confidentiality’, was voiced, despite the need for the victim to attend court when pursuing a criminal complaint; perhaps this response was referring to the need to improve ‘trust’ and to demonstrate that organisations are listening to victims’ needs and taking the topic seriously. ‘Build trust’ only represented 10.7% of the service providers’ responses, which seems very low if service providers were seeking to provide procedural justice for the victims.
How, then, do the victim responses differ from service providers’ responses and perceptions? Table 3 highlights that victims see the need for a more ‘open door’ approach by the police, so that the public is better able to see how the police respond in these matters and the different aspects of policing involved in dealing with the matter (39.7%), versus the service providers’ main response of marketing support (39.3%), which would appear to be expressing similar sentiments. Second from the victims’ perspective is the need for action to be taken promptly and effectively when a matter is reported (17.5%), suggesting that the victims sampled have considered the response received following reporting the hate crime to be less than they would expect. Support also features in victim (12.1%) responses, and these two aspects map against service providers’ response of ‘Staff aware of procedures’ (26.2%), to maximise the response and support given to victims. However, it is notable that victims require more swift and harsher punitive action to be taken against offenders (10.2%), coupled with feelings that the current mechanisms to report hate are not considered safe during and following a report being made (6.8%), yet these issues are not found in the service providers’ feedback. There is also an aspect of ownership of reporting, with victims feeling that more should be done surrounding empowerment, so that victims can help themselves, and service providers thought that more education would reduce barriers reflecting this issue. Such a response could be an indicator that as a result of policing processes and perceived inadequate timescales and punishments for the problem, that the public have lost faith in the system and are seeking to regain control. To facilitate empowerment and help stem repeat hate incidents, perhaps restorative justice should be used alongside punishment of perpetrators.
A sample of five responses taken from the victim responses will enrich the meaning behind the data: ‘Have a campaign so that everyone can report these things together to try and encourage people. Let them know that they are not alone. Better media portrayal of police as the media show they are dropping in standards and procedures.’‘For the police to have a solid procedure that they adhere to with every case of hate crime. Not to brush it under the carpet like it’s nothing and to protect the victim and not to sympathise with the offender. For the police to show impartiality and to not show any tendencies of discrimination themselves. Police to build a rapport with victims. Victims knowing that organisations are going to help them when they promise them support and help, rather than promising and not doing anything – it creates mistrust.’‘To be reassured that if they report it that it would be taken seriously. For the police to realise that hate crime can be very distressing for victims and for them to show the same compassion as VSC towards victims, by seeing their side of the argument and sympathising with them. Just because it’s a verbal altercation doesn’t mean it can’t have the same negative effects on victims as larger and more “serious” crimes.’‘Make sure that victims know that they are safe when they report and that something is going to be done about it – more than just a warning. Police do a good job currently but historically people don’t have much faith in them, particularly the groups of people that are victims of hate crime as the police have also discriminated against them in the past.’‘Improve society’s views on different ethnic cultures to improve people’s ignorance and understandings of others, it is narrowmindedness that causes hate crime and racism and that needs to be changed as we currently live in a very hostile country for any ethnicity other than British.’
The victim’s responses suggest a lack of confidence in the Criminal Justice Service to serve and protect the victim, i.e. a lack of procedural justice and police legitimacy. Considering the Seven Key Decision Points (McDevitt et al., 2000), in this study steps one and two have been taken by the victims of hate crime who reported (the sample). Step three is a major barrier to respondents, with victims perceiving that reporting a hate incident to the police is not going to help them and may make matters worse. This latter aspect – a lack of efficiency – appears to be an equally important aspect to fair treatment and is runs counter to some proponents of procedural justice, who claim that this is not an important factor.
Furthermore, with regard to steps five to seven, improved understanding, sensitivity and empathy are required by the police and other service providers to support the victim in their time of need. This may be a severe challenge to retrain and find time to fully support victims when front-line providers are dealing with ever-increasing demands and static or decreasing resources.
Conclusion
There is a clear endorsement looking at the data that ‘procedural justice’ as outlined by Sunshine and Tyler (2003) needs improvement within Wales to ensure communities engage with the police and other agencies when considering reporting hate incidents. Herek et al. (1999) support this study’s findings that there is low perception of a positive and successful police response leading to a reduced likelihood of reporting. It is interesting that victims feel that a greater transparency of the police response is needed, which further endorses this sentiment.
Additional data in this study supports the following notions: that for some, behaviours are being normalised (Browne et al., 2011); that fear is also documented in the data as a barrier experienced in reporting, either as fear of repercussions or because of what reporting means to them (Chakraborti et al., 2014; Wickes et al., 2016; Wong and Christmann, 2008); and that there is a lack of awareness among some victims of what a hate crime is (Chakraborti et al., 2014).
The research demonstrate that victims perceive that social change is required and that the justice system is unsympathetic, too slow and inefficient in dealing with the issue, with harsher and swifter punishments being required to effect trust in the system.
There is also an obvious difference between the victim perspective and the service provider perspective on the matter of reporting barriers and solutions, emphasising that more should be done to bridge the gap between the two cohorts.
Although the data presented is only an early interrogation of the data, it does bring new learning and reinforces literature from within the field. A full analysis of the data obtained and the new perspectives it brings will be published in due course. For now, however, there is a definitive need for police to validate victim experiences in which empowerment and trust are gained (Bradford et al., 2013).

Racine Leads 20-State Coalition Urging Facebook to Aggressively Combat the Spread of Hate and Disinformation Online,False,"District of Columbia Attorney General Karl A. Racine issued the following news release on Aug. 5:
Attorney General Karl A. Racine, New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal, and Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul today co-led a coalition of 20 state Attorneys General calling on Facebook, Inc. (Facebook), to adopt additional preventive measures against the spread of hate and disinformation on its platform. In a letter to Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, the Attorneys General assert that ""[p]rivate parties, organized groups and public officials continue to use Facebook to spread misinformation and project messages of hate against different groups of Americans,"" leading to abuse of individual Facebook users. The letter cites the findings from Facebook's own internal audit indicating that the company has refused to enforce its own policies against dangerous organizations and individuals, including white supremacists and other extremists. In response, the Attorneys General urge Facebook to ""strengthen its commitment to civil rights and fighting disinformation and discrimination"" and to offer greater support for users who fall victim to online intimidation and harassment.
""Facebook has a responsibility to protect hundreds of thousands of District residents--and, indeed, millions of Americans--from hate and harassment while interacting on the company's online platforms,"" said AG Racine. ""Our coalition of state Attorneys General are calling on Facebook to not only meet the commitments it has already laid out for itself, but to step up its guard against the spread of extremism online.""
Facebook, headquartered in Menlo Park, California, is a digital social networking service with more than 2 billion active users around the world--including 250 million Americans, and hundreds of thousands of District residents. Through a website and a mobile application, Facebook allows users to communicate and share content with personalized networks of ""friends.""
Recent surveys suggest more than 40 percent of Americans have experienced some form of online harassment, and that of those victims, more than 75 percent have reported being harassed on Facebook. The Attorneys General observe in their letter that much of the harassment reported by Facebook users focuses on characteristics protected by civil rights laws, including race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender and gender identity, and disability. Such harassment can include cyberstalking, maliciously publishing someone's personal information, or filing false police reports targeting the victim. The letter contends that at present, ""recourse is unavailable for too many of these victims,"" due to factors including insufficient, limited services offered to victims by Facebook.
The Attorneys General acknowledge that ""Facebook has--on occasion--taken action to address violations of its terms of service in cases where we have helped elevate our constituents' concerns."" But they further emphasize that many Facebook users continue to find the redress process ""slow, frustrating, and ineffective.""
Recommendations for Facebook
The reforms recommended in today's letter, many of which are highlighted in the company's recent civil rights audit, include calls for Facebook to:
Aggressively enforce policies against hate speech and extremist organizations: The audit found that while Facebook already has policies on the books to prevent the spread of hate speech, the company neglects to fully enforce these policies. The Attorneys General call on the company to follow through on its commitment to uphold its policies. Further, the Attorneys General urge the company to expand its policies in order to limit inflammatory advertisements that vilify minority groups.
Allow public, third-party audits of hate content and enforcement to guide best practices: The Attorneys General recommend the company open itself up to additional audit efforts, in the vein of the civil rights audit. Further, they advise the company to accept ongoing, independent analysis of the platform's content population scheme, and follow suggested best practices determined from these efforts.
Enhance supportive services for users targeted by hateful or harassing content: The Attorneys General encourage Facebook to offer live, real-time assistance to victims of intimidation and harassment on the platform, make information about unlawful harassment and intimidation more readily available to users, and strengthen users' ability to filter, report, and block malicious content.
AG Racine co-led this letter with New Jersey Attorney General Grewal and Illinois Attorney General Raoul. They were joined by the Attorneys General of California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, Vermont and Wisconsin.

To: Mark Zuckerberg, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Sheryl Sandberg, Chief Operating Officer, Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, California 94025
Dear Mr. Zuckerberg & Ms. Sandberg:
We, the undersigned State Attorneys General, write to request that you take additional steps to prevent Facebook from being used to spread disinformation and hate and to facilitate discrimination. We also ask that you take more steps to provide redress for users who fall victim to intimidation and harassment, including violence and digital abuse.
Our nation is in the midst of a reckoning on issues of racial justice and civil rights. As State Attorneys General, we have witnessed firsthand how the country's longstanding undercurrent of discrimination has burst into the open, as reports of hate crimes and bias incidents of all kinds have dramatically increased in recent years./1 And while recent events have further highlighted the systemic injustice that persists in our society, the last few months also have seen millions of Americans join together to call for action against bias and racism.
As you know, Facebook is not immune to these problems. Although Facebook has made some progress in counteracting the use of its platform to dehumanize and demean, that is just the beginning of what is necessary./2 Private parties, organized groups, and public officials continue to use Facebook to spread misinformation and project messages of hate against different groups of Americans. In many cases, these messages lead to intimidation and harassment of particular individuals online.
According to recent surveys, more than forty percent of Americans have experienced some form of online harassment, including cyberstalking, doxing (maliciously publishing someone's personal information), and swatting (filing false police reports to prompt a law enforcement response targeting the victim)./3 Of those Americans who report having been harassed online, more than three-quarters have reported being harassed on Facebook./4 Much of that harassment is focused on characteristics protected by the civil rights laws that many of us are charged with enforcing, including race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender and gender identity, and disability./5 Recourse is unavailable for too many of these victims, due to limitations on the services that Facebook offers victims and other impediments to securing relief through civil lawsuits or criminal prosecutions.
We understand that Facebook has committed to the public and its users that it will ""invest billions of dollars each year to keep [Facebook's] community safe and continuously work with outside experts to review and update [Facebook's] policies.""/6 But, as the most recent Civil Rights Audit reveals, the steps you have taken thus far have fallen short. With the vast resources at your disposal, we believe there is much more that you can do to prevent the use of Facebook as a vehicle for misinformation and discrimination, and to prevent your users from being victimized by harassment and intimidation on your platforms.
As State Attorneys General, we are responsible for protecting the safety and wellbeing of all the communities we serve. As part of that mission, we must constantly contend with the impacts of online hate, intimidation, and harassment. Many of our offices enforce the laws that protect our residents from bias offenses, intimidation, and harassment--whether online or on our streets./7 And many of our offices include units dedicated to serving the victims of unlawful conduct, including helping them access and use tools that allow them to vindicate their rights. As part of our responsibilities to our communities, Attorneys General have helped residents navigate Facebook's processes for victims to address abuse on its platform. While Facebook has--on occasion--taken action to address violations of its terms of service in cases where we have helped elevate our constituents' concerns,/8 we know that everyday users of Facebook can find the process slow, frustrating, and ineffective. Thus, we write to highlight positive steps that Facebook can take to strengthen its policies and practices. We hope to work with you to ensure that fewer individuals suffer online harassment and discrimination, and that it is quickly and effectively addressed when they do.
Based on our collective experience, we believe that Facebook should take additional actions including the following steps--many of which are highlighted in Facebook's recent Civil Rights Audit--to strengthen its commitment to civil rights and fighting disinformation and discrimination:
* Aggressively enforce Facebook policies against hate speech and organized hate organizations: Although Facebook has developed policies against hate speech and organizations that peddle it, we remain concerned that Facebook's policies on Dangerous Individuals and Organizations, including but not limited to its policies on white nationalist and white supremacist content, are not enforced quickly and comprehensively enough./9 Content that violates Facebook's own policies too often escapes removal just because it comes as coded language, rather than specific magic words. And even where Facebook takes steps to address a particular violation, it often fails to proactively address the follow-on actions by replacement or splinter groups that quickly emerge.
* Allow public, third-party audits of hate content and enforcement: To gauge the ongoing progress of Facebook's enforcement efforts, independent experts should be permitted access to the data necessary to conduct regular, transparent third-party audits of hate and hate-related misinformation on the platform, including any information made available to the Global Oversight Board. As part of this effort, Facebook should capture data on the prevalence of different forms of hate content on the platform, whether or not covered by Facebook's own community standards, thus allowing the public to determine whether enforcement of anti-hate policies differs based on the type of hate content at issue.
* Commit to an ongoing, independent analysis of Facebook's content population scheme and the prompt development of best practices guidance: By funneling users toward particular types of content, Facebook's content population scheme, including its algorithms, can push users into extremist online communities that feature divisive and inflammatory messages, often directed at particular groups. Although Facebook has conducted research and considered programs to reduce this risk, there is still no mandatory guidance for coders and other teams involved in content population. Facebook should commit to an ongoing, independent analysis of its content population scheme, including its algorithms, and also continuously implement mandatory protocols as best practices are identified to curb bias and prevent recommendations of hate content and groups.
* Expand policies limiting inflammatory advertisements that vilify minority groups: Although Facebook currently prohibits ads that claim that certain people, because of their membership in a protected group, pose a threat to the physical safety of communities or the nation, its policies still allow attacks that characterize such groups as threats to national culture or values.10 The current prohibition should be expanded to include such ads.
We also recommend the following measures to improve the supportive services that Facebook offers to users who have been or may become victims of harassment and intimidation on its platforms:
* Offer live real-time assistance: Facebook users can report intimidation and harassment but cannot immediately engage a Facebook employee who can promptly address issues that are occurring in real time. Victims of intimidation and harassment would benefit from more immediate access to Facebook employees who can offer prompt assistance. For example, if a user is being doxed, live assistance could help stop the spread of the user's personal information before the damage cannot be undone.
* Make information about harassment and intimidation more readily available: Facebook should facilitate evidence preservation and cooperate with victims and law enforcement agencies seeking evidence to prove a case of harassment or intimidation, such as cyberstalking or non-consensual distribution of intimate imagery, when the offenders use Facebook to perpetrate their crimes.
* Strengthen filtering, reporting, and blocking tools: Facebook allows users to block individual people, but users should have stronger tools and more choices for filtering out and reporting hateful, intimidating, and harassing content they do not want to see in their feeds. For example, if members of a Facebook group are engaged in an organized campaign of harassment against a single user, the victim should be able to block all members of the group and report batches of posts or users without having to block or report each individually.
We urge Facebook to take these steps to better tackle hate in our society, and address the interests of users who are victimized by others in the online community that Facebook has built.

Herring Calls on Facebook to Take Stronger Steps to Prevent Use of Its Platforms to Spread Hate and Disinformation,False,"Virginia Attorney General Mark R. Herring issued the following news release on Aug. 5:
Attorney General Mark R. Herring today joined 19 attorneys general from across the United States in calling on Facebook to take additional steps to prevent the popular social media website from being used to spread hate and disinformation. Attorney General Herring and his colleagues also urged Facebook to provide stronger support for users who fall victim to online intimidation and harassment on its platforms.
In a letter sent today to Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, Attorney General Herring and his colleagues assert that despite its stated commitment to working to keep its user community safe, Facebook has fallen short in keeping hate content off its platforms and protecting users from online harassment.
""Unfortunately, over the past few years, we have seen how Facebook can be used as a tool to spread misinformation and hate that can have serious, real-life consequences,"" said Attorney General Herring. ""Especially now, when our country finds itself in a moment of tremendous social change and with an incredibly important presidential election in just a few months, Facebook must take stronger steps to further protect its users from hate and prevent its platform from being used to spread disinformation.""
The coalition's letter highlights that the nation is presently in a moment of reckoning on issues of racial justice and civil rights. Against this backdrop, the letter states that ""[p]rivate parties, organized groups and public officials continue to use Facebook to spread misinformation and project messages of hate against different groups of Americans,"" with many of those messages leading to the abuse of individual Facebook users.
The letter follows the release of a Civil Rights Audit of Facebook's practices - commissioned by the company and completed in July - that faults Facebook for failing to advance civil rights, and refusing to enforce its own policies against dangerous organizations and individuals, including white supremacists and other extremists.
Recent surveys suggest more than 40 percent of Americans have experienced some form of online harassment, and that of those victims, more than 75 percent have reported being harassed on Facebook. The letter urges Facebook to implement several reforms recommended in the Civil Rights Audit to ""strengthen its commitment to civil rights and fighting disinformation and discrimination."" It further recommends steps designed to improve Facebook's supportive services for victims.
According to today's letter, much of the harassment reported by Facebook users focuses on characteristics protected by civil rights laws, including race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender and gender identity, and disability.
Such harassment can include conduct like cyberstalking, doxing (maliciously publishing someone's personal information), and swatting (filing false police reports to prompt law enforcement response targeting the victim.) The letter contends that at present, ""recourse is unavailable for too many of these victims,"" due to limitations on the services that Facebook offers victims, as well as other factors.
The Attorneys General acknowledge that ""Facebook has--on occasion--taken action to address violations of its terms of service in cases where we have helped elevate our constituents' concerns."" But the letter adds that many Facebook users continue to find the redress process ""slow, frustrating, and ineffective.""
The reforms recommended in today's letter, many of which are highlighted in the recent Civil Rights Audit, include calls for Facebook to:
* Aggressively enforce its policies against hate speech and organized hate organizations;
* Allow public, third-party audits of hate content and enforcement;
* Commit to an ongoing, independent analysis of Facebook's content population scheme and the prompt development of best practices guidance; and

Mark Zuckerberg, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Sheryl Sandberg, Chief Operating Officer, Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, California 94025
Dear Mr. Zuckerberg & Ms. Sandberg:
We, the undersigned State Attorneys General, write to request that you take additional steps to prevent Facebook from being used to spread disinformation and hate and to facilitate discrimination. We also ask that you take more steps to provide redress for users who fall victim to intimidation and harassment, including violence and digital abuse.
Our nation is in the midst of a reckoning on issues of racial justice and civil rights. As State Attorneys General, we have witnessed firsthand how the country's longstanding undercurrent of discrimination has burst into the open, as reports of hate crimes and bias incidents of all kinds have dramatically increased in recent years./1 And while recent events have further highlighted the systemic injustice that persists in our society, the last few months also have seen millions of Americans join together to call for action against bias and racism.
As you know, Facebook is not immune to these problems. Although Facebook has made some progress in counteracting the use of its platform to dehumanize and demean, that is just the beginning of what is necessary./2 Private parties, organized groups, and public officials continue to use Facebook to spread misinformation and project messages of hate against different groups of Americans. In many cases, these messages lead to intimidation and harassment of particular individuals online.
According to recent surveys, more than forty percent of Americans have experienced some form of online harassment, including cyberstalking, doxing (maliciously publishing someone's personal information), and swatting (filing false police reports to prompt a law enforcement response targeting the victim)./3 Of those Americans who report having been harassed online, more than three-quarters have reported being harassed on Facebook./4 Much of that harassment is focused on characteristics protected by the civil rights laws that many of us are charged with enforcing, including race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender and gender identity, and disability./5 Recourse is unavailable for too many of these victims, due to limitations on the services that Facebook offers victims and other impediments to securing relief through civil lawsuits or criminal prosecutions.
We understand that Facebook has committed to the public and its users that it will ""invest billions of dollars each year to keep [Facebook's] community safe and continuously work with outside experts to review and update [Facebook's] policies.""/6 But, as the most recent Civil Rights Audit reveals, the steps you have taken thus far have fallen short. With the vast resources at your disposal, we believe there is much more that you can do to prevent the use of Facebook as a vehicle for misinformation and discrimination, and to prevent your users from being victimized by harassment and intimidation on your platforms.
As State Attorneys General, we are responsible for protecting the safety and wellbeing of all the communities we serve. As part of that mission, we must constantly contend with the impacts of online hate, intimidation, and harassment. Many of our offices enforce the laws that protect our residents from bias offenses, intimidation, and harassment--whether online or on our streets./7 And many of our offices include units dedicated to serving the victims of unlawful conduct, including helping them access and use tools that allow them to vindicate their rights. As part of our responsibilities to our communities, Attorneys General have helped residents navigate Facebook's processes for victims to address abuse on its platform. While Facebook has--on occasion--taken action to address violations of its terms of service in cases where we have helped elevate our constituents' concerns,/8 we know that everyday users of Facebook can find the process slow, frustrating, and ineffective. Thus, we write to highlight positive steps that Facebook can take to strengthen its policies and practices. We hope to work with you to ensure that fewer individuals suffer online harassment and discrimination, and that it is quickly and effectively addressed when they do.
Based on our collective experience, we believe that Facebook should take additional actions including the following steps--many of which are highlighted in Facebook's recent Civil Rights Audit--to strengthen its commitment to civil rights and fighting disinformation and discrimination:
* Aggressively enforce Facebook policies against hate speech and organized hate organizations: Although Facebook has developed policies against hate speech and organizations that peddle it, we remain concerned that Facebook's policies on Dangerous Individuals and Organizations, including but not limited to its policies on white nationalist and white supremacist content, are not enforced quickly and comprehensively enough./9 Content that violates Facebook's own policies too often escapes removal just because it comes as coded language, rather than specific magic words. And even where Facebook takes steps to address a particular violation, it often fails to proactively address the follow-on actions by replacement or splinter groups that quickly emerge.
* Allow public, third-party audits of hate content and enforcement: To gauge the ongoing progress of Facebook's enforcement efforts, independent experts should be permitted access to the data necessary to conduct regular, transparent third-party audits of hate and hate-related misinformation on the platform, including any information made available to the Global Oversight Board. As part of this effort, Facebook should capture data on the prevalence of different forms of hate content on the platform, whether or not covered by Facebook's own community standards, thus allowing the public to determine whether enforcement of anti-hate policies differs based on the type of hate content at issue.
* Commit to an ongoing, independent analysis of Facebook's content population scheme and the prompt development of best practices guidance: By funneling users toward particular types of content, Facebook's content population scheme, including its algorithms, can push users into extremist online communities that feature divisive and inflammatory messages, often directed at particular groups. Although Facebook has conducted research and considered programs to reduce this risk, there is still no mandatory guidance for coders and other teams involved in content population. Facebook should commit to an ongoing, independent analysis of its content population scheme, including its algorithms, and also continuously implement mandatory protocols as best practices are identified to curb bias and prevent recommendations of hate content and groups.
* Expand policies limiting inflammatory advertisements that vilify minority groups: Although Facebook currently prohibits ads that claim that certain people, because of their membership in a protected group, pose a threat to the physical safety of communities or the nation, its policies still allow attacks that characterize such groups as threats to national culture or values.10 The current prohibition should be expanded to include such ads.
We also recommend the following measures to improve the supportive services that Facebook offers to users who have been or may become victims of harassment and intimidation on its platforms:
* Offer live real-time assistance: Facebook users can report intimidation and harassment but cannot immediately engage a Facebook employee who can promptly address issues that are occurring in real time. Victims of intimidation and harassment would benefit from more immediate access to Facebook employees who can offer prompt assistance. For example, if a user is being doxed, live assistance could help stop the spread of the user's personal information before the damage cannot be undone.
* Make information about harassment and intimidation more readily available: Facebook should facilitate evidence preservation and cooperate with victims and law enforcement agencies seeking evidence to prove a case of harassment or intimidation, such as cyberstalking or non-consensual distribution of intimate imagery, when the offenders use Facebook to perpetrate their crimes.
* Strengthen filtering, reporting, and blocking tools: Facebook allows users to block individual people, but users should have stronger tools and more choices for filtering out and reporting hateful, intimidating, and harassing content they do not want to see in their feeds. For example, if members of a Facebook group are engaged in an organized campaign of harassment against a single user, the victim should be able to block all members of the group and report batches of posts or users without having to block or report each individually.
We urge Facebook to take these steps to better tackle hate in our society, and address the interests of users who are victimized by others in the online community that Facebook has built.

50,/content/Bias_Crime_Lexis_1.DOCX,Power Line,2020-12-15,2995 words,,,,"Bill Gates recommends, take 2",False," December 15 -- Back in 2015 I asked the Hudson Institute's John Walters to take a look at Michelle Alexander's dreadful but influential The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness. Mr. Walters turned his attention to Alexander's book together with his Hudson Institute colleague David Murray. Subsequently posted in footnoted form on Hudson's site as ""Revisiting 'The New Jim Crow,'"" the essay below was written for us. I want to add it to my own comments in ""Bill Gates recommends"" yesterday:
This book (hereafter, TNJC) is careless. The carelessness produces misdirection and it undermines the argument. Facts are stretched, the scholarly apparatus is weak, and the core argument is often contradicted by its own evidence.
Nonetheless, TNJC is a very popular book-rising to The New York Times best-seller list, required reading for incoming students at Brown University, said by the San Francisco Chronicle to be ""the Bible of a social movement."" Is its power rooted in a deeper truth or in a revealing lie that many of us want to believe or need to believe in the face of an ugly reality?
Full disclosure: We have lived through and remember the drug and crime problem of the 1980's onward. We have done our best to make the problem smaller from positions within the White House, serving for at least a time in every Administration from Reagan to Obama. We know from personal experience that TNJC is built on falsehood. We also recognize that those who want to believe TNJC may view our experience as a cover-up of the great wrong alleged. But we write with the hope that open-minded readers can and will judge the facts for themselves.
In a nutshell, TNJC argues that ""[w]e have not ended racial caste in America; we have merely redesigned it."" From the book jacket: ""By targeting black men through the War on Drugs, and decimating communities of color, the U.S. criminal justice system functions as a contemporary system of racial control-relegating millions to permanent second-class status."" A primary concern is the loss of the right to vote.
The specific list of factual misstatements is long. For a book with scholarly pretentions, it is noteworthy that the book lacks a bibliography, and that its endnote citations are woeful.
Consider that we are told: ""The Reagan administration hired staff to publicize the emergence of crack cocaine in 1985 as part of a strategic effort to build public and legislative support for the war."" The point is not a minor one, since it is offered in support of a core thesis: when there really wasn't a drug problem in our cities, in order to achieve ""social control"" over blacks through ""mass incarceration,"" President Ronald Reagan created and then hyped a crisis using the media. This claim is found in the Introduction. Turning to the endnote, however, one finds no documentation, but rather a simple line that Reagan's action ""is discussed in more depth in Chapter 1.""
That's a bit cheesy, but what then happens in Chapter 1? There, after reading about ""code words"" for race, we find again that Reagan ""launched a media offensive to justify the 'War on Drugs.'"" And there's another endnote which, when pursued, leads nowhere. It is a reference to the 1992 National Drug Control Strategy-produced after the Reagan Presidency.
This is cat-and-mouse. It anticipates an unserious, unquestioning reader, one willing to be led.
What about the author's claim that the ""War on Drugs"" was initiated by Reagan (detractors of Richard Nixon will be disappointed), or the even more dramatic claim that Reagan's ""ambitious federal policy"" in fact turned into ""an actual war."" How are we to take this hyperbole?
The author cites fears ""in poor black communities that the War on Drugs was part of a genocidal plan by the government to destroy black people in the United States."" She calls these ""conspiracy theories,"" but what does the professor actually believe? She tells us: ""While the conspiracy theories were initially dismissed as far-fetched, if not loony, the word on the street [i.e., genocide] turned out to be right, at least up to a point.""
To forward the concept of a policy being ""genocide up to a point"" (that point being the intent to kill a race and actually trying to do so) is such extreme overstatement it should be self-discrediting.
Still TNJC plunges forward. Evidence that the crack epidemic was ""genocidal"" is supposed to be be contained in the claim that ""[t]he CIA admitted in 1998 that guerilla armies that it actively supported in Nicaragua were smuggling illegal drugs into the United States."" The CIA further ""admitted that . . . it blocked law enforcement efforts to investigate illegal drug networks"" funding its covert war.
Whatever the claimed involvement of the CIA, its actual significance-how much illegal drug supply this ""conspiracy"" dumped into American streets-is something the author tellingly declines to explain or quantify. If you are old enough to remember the Medellin and Cali cartels (which really did traffic massive amounts of cocaine into the United States during that period), you are supposed to forget them here.
Assumptions like these, in which every development suggests the existence of a full-scale ""plot,"" might incline us to dismissiveness when the author finally gets to actual data. Blacks are disproportionately incarcerated for drug crimes on a straight per-capita basis. That's certainly true. But it's not a phenomenon peculiar to drug statutes; blacks are incarcerated for (and, crucially, victims of) almost every Index crime at depressingly higher per capita rates.
Even though TNJC's attack ostensibly focuses on drug laws, it's argument ultimately embraces the whole of American criminal justice: it is all ""a tightly networked system of laws, policies, customs, and institutions"" that produces ""mass incarceration"" to achieve ""social control."" Here, Ms. Alexander quotes Michael Tonry: ""Governments decide how much punishment they want, and these decisions are in no way related to crime rates.""
But this claim that blacks are subordinated and controlled creates an obvious problem. TNJC must explain away the election of Barack Obama within a system allegedly dedicated to keeping blacks from power: ""Many will wonder how a nation that just elected its first black president could have a racial caste system,"" and ""[i]t's a fair question,"" she acknowledges. Indeed, it is. But her answer is odd: ""[T]here is no inconsistency whatsoever between the election of Barack Obama to the highest office in the land and the existence of a racial caste system in the era of colorblindness. The current system of control depends on black exceptionalism; it is not disproved or undermined by it."" We have no idea what exactly that's supposed to mean, but it does seem to suggest that for America, where Ms. Alexander is concerned, it's damned when you do-and double-damned when you don't.
Caste or Conduct?
TNJC opens with a compelling anecdote about a man named Jarvious Cotton:
Cotton's great-great-grandfather could not vote as a slave. His great-grandfather was beaten to death by the Ku Klux Klan for attempting to vote. His grandfather was prevented from voting by Klan intimidation. His father was barred from voting by poll taxes and literacy tests. Today, Jarvious Cotton cannot vote because he, like many black men in the United States, has been labeled a felon, and is currently on parole.
The idea that the state of Mississippi, home to Jarvious Cotton, has deliberately designed its laws to create a systematic racial caste system would have been undeniable 50 years ago. But has there been no progress since? Yes, Mississippi continues to deny the ballot to any person convicted of ""murder, rape, bribery, theft, arson, obtaining money or goods under false pretenses, perjury, forgery, embezzlement or bigamy."" If this is a caste system-unless you consider ""murderer"" and ""arsonist"" perfectly acceptable synonyms for ""African American""-it's an oddly leaky one.
On its face, instead, Mississippi voting status is determined by conduct. And while violent crimes may involve clear racial disparities of the sort TNJC is exercised about, disenfranchisement for typically white-collar offenses like ""bribery,"" financial fraud, and ""embezzlement"" would hardly seem consistent with a conscious ""project"" to create a race-based caste system.
Nor does actual voting behavior sustain Ms. Alexander's case for the existence of such a project. As the Associated Press reported after the 2012 Presidential election, registered black voters in Mississippi went to the polls at a higher rate than did white voters. This is not what ""systematic racism"" looks like, as anyone old enough to have witnessed the Civil Rights Movement can confirm.
Then there is the problem of Ms. Alexander's maddeningly slippery rhetoric. TNJC tells us only that Jarvious Cotton cannot vote because, ""like many black men in America,"" he ""has been labeled a felon."" TNJC does not tell us why he has been so labeled. It's as if ""labels"" descended willy-nilly, independent of conduct.
In fact, Jarvious Cotton was indicted in Mississippi for the shooting death of 17-year-old Robert Irby, escaped from prison while awaiting trial, and fled to New York where he was subsequently arrested for a marijuana violation-and where fingerprint analysis then ""labeled"" him a fugitive wanted for a capital crime. Mr. Cotton was later extradited back to Mississippi and convicted of murder by a jury of his peers.
Jarvious Cotton is now out on parole and ineligible to vote in Mississippi, not because he is black, but because he killed someone-which is not the same thing, though TNJC consistently conflates these issues rather than wrestle with the messy and inconvenient details.
Conduct either matters or it doesn't. New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton asserts that it does. Bratton argues that blacks and Hispanics ""represent half of our city's population, but 96.9 percent of those who are shot, and 97.6 percent of those who commit the shootings."" These are terrible, troubling numbers. Dismissing the underlying phenomenon as a matter of mere ""labels"" is an irresponsible evasion.
Or consider TNJC's fable of the suburbs:
From the outset, the drug war could have been waged primarily in overwhelmingly white suburbs or on college campuses. SWAT teams could have rappelled from helicopters in gated suburban communities and raided the homes of high school lacrosse players known for hosting coke and ecstasy parties after their games....Suburban homemakers could have been placed under surveillance and subjected to undercover operations designed to catch them violating laws regulating the use and sale of prescription ""uppers."" All of this could have happened as a matter of routine in white communities, but it did not. Instead, when police go looking for drugs, they look in the hood.
We are expected to ignore the fact that black and white middleclass suburbs are not, by any objective measure, the primary locus of the criminal conduct at issue: firearms discharges (detected by automated recorders, not subject to ""implicit bias""), violent-crime-related 911 calls, actual homicide victims-all these things are significantly less common in suburbs, and every sensible person knows that already.
The Drug Data
Again we must dismiss actual data when we read that ""The uncomfortable reality is that arrests and convictions for drug offenses-not violent crime-have propelled mass incarceration."" In state prisons, holding the largest number of incarcerated inmates, only 16 percent are drug offenders-54 percent of those incarcerated are violent offenders.
In the substantially smaller federal system, the proportion of drug offenders does approach 50 percent, largely because federal enforcement focuses on major domestic and international traffickers-34 percent of the federal prison population is Hispanic and 23 percent are not U.S. citizens. TNJC's argument that drug crime, particularly among blacks, has propelled incarceration rates simply does not add up.
But how strong is TNJC's best case about the racial injustice of the drug war? The argument is that blacks are treated unjustly by disproportionate drug arrests when survey data show that their use of drugs is less than that of whites, and even their rate of drug dealing is surpassed by that of whites.
One could refute the specific criminal justice and drug use claims, and we shall try in one case. But we suspect that this is a trap. Every effort to rebut will be seen as confirmation of denial, even complicity, in American injustice. Even invoking the differential victimization of blacks by crime can be dismissed as pretext sustaining the system of injustice.
The primary source for TNJC drug data is a 2006 report, ""Juvenile Offenders and Victims,"" authored by Howard Snyder and Melissa Sickmund (the author has her as ""Sickman,"" as do other prior sources).
It is worth examining these claims with care.
Specifically, the ""stark racial disparities cannot be explained by rates of drug crime,"" because blacks are said not to use drugs disproportionately. In fact, the author argues, ""If there are significant differences in the surveys to be found, they frequently suggest that whites, particularly white youth, are more likely to engage in drug crime than people of color."" Finally, ""white youth are more likely than black youth to engage in illegal drug sales.""
Do these counterintuitive claims stand up when we look at the full battery of statistics, and not just those hand-picked?
First, the claims do not comport with the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, the principal data source for drug use among adults. Based on self-reports, it shows that every year since a redesign in 2002 until the most recent iteration (2013 data), black rates of current drug use are not lower than those of whites, Hispanics, and Asians-they exceed them.
TNJC receives more support for (some) youth drug use rates, but only for the unwary. The major long-term survey of youth drug use, the school-based Monitoring the Future (MTF) study run by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, shows that for high-school seniors, whites report generally higher illicit drug use rates than blacks.
Caution is necessary, however, before accepting TNJC. MTF excludes by design youth who are school drop-outs, institutionalized, homeless, or runaways. Which is precisely the fate of many youth drug users. That is, given the large disproportion of black youth who have dropped out (especially drug users), they are simply not proportionately present in the sample measuring seniors.
Blacks also report, in this survey, only half the rate of alcohol use, and only one-third the rates of tobacco use, compared to white youth, further suggesting some skewing by virtue of differential attrition.
Finally, there is the claim concerning drug sellers. The source for this is the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, again based on self-reports, that asked whether between the ages of 12-16, youth had sold drugs.
TNJC seizes on the fact that white youth answered yes in 17 percent of cases, Hispanics in 16 percent, but blacks in only 13 percent of cases. (The confidence intervals are +/- 2 percentage points, making the four points between black and white reports a pretty close thing.)
The case is stronger when asked of youth who sold drugs at ages 16-17, only. For these youth, the disparity does grow: whites reported being 42 percent of those who sold, blacks only 29 percent.
Case closed? TNJC leaves off, with the statistic cherry picked. But what does the next, unmentioned, table show? Move forward one year. For those who sold drugs at age 18-19, only, the data flip: blacks represent 44 percent, whites only 28 percent; an even greater disparity, but in the opposite direction.
And completely missing is the report's summary of case rates, which subverts TNJC's argument: ""In 2002, case rates for black juveniles were substantially higher than rates for other juveniles in all offense categories. . . . [I]n 1991, the drug offense case rate for black juveniles was more than 5.5 times the rate for white juveniles.""
Note that the critical exhibit for TNJC, that blacks are disproportionately imprisoned for drug trafficking crimes that they don't differentially commit, hinges on the slender reed of a 2006 body of self-report data from juveniles which shows no such thing.
This, as we say, is the book's strongest case. Once we actually incorporate the reality of criminal conduct, however, the book descends into self-deceptions, more and more difficult to believe. In fact, its claims contradict our shared experience.
The author should acknowledge that great political pressure for tough law enforcement has come from black communities that suffer disproportionate victimization. It has come from the fears, and hopes, of mothers of sons at risk of death from gang involvement. This decisive truth about law enforcement in America is the real refutation of TNJC.
If you're not troubled yet, you should be. The popularity of TNJC risks engendering a cycle of violent victimization of our most vulnerable citizens, who must depend on the criminal justice system to be their protector. The reality of black victimization requires us to strengthen, not condemn and abandon, institutions of law and order. TNJC makes telling the truth about our struggle on the streets an urgent duty.
The new students at Brown University, required to confront untrue charges that criminal justice in America is no more than an exercise in deliberate ""mass incarceration,"" should beware lest we fall prey to yet another ""low, dishonest decade.""

51,/content/Bias_Crime_Lexis_1.DOCX,The News International,2020-09-27,1357 words,Vol. 30; No. 179,,,Crime: a disease,False," The first recorded act of infamy was the murder of Abel at the hands of Cain, his brother. Crime is as old as humankind itself. It shall be a part thereof till the hereafter. It is how we mould our lives to take precautions and the state fulfils its constitutional obligation of providing security that can be a defining aspect of a comparatively safer life.
Crime, as we see it, might range from a teenager snatching a purse or a cellphone, to a public office-holder siphoning off billions; a fractured bone in a street brawl or a quiet young individual murdering his family members. There is no single definition that can encapsulate crime in its entity.
Over the last decades, the majority of countries have achieved remarkable progress in public health. The single contributing factor has been the identification of diseases and measures to prevent the same. Conversely, in the same time frame, public safety has deteriorated due to an alarming surge in crime rate.
In the developed world, researchers and specialists now place crime in the category of a disease; a contagious one. They strongly advocate the same tools and measures used to avoid a contagious disease. The prevalent pandemic has taught us the virtues of precautionary measures. We undertake what, over time, feel like oppressive precautionary compulsions. We do so keeping in mind the far dangerous consequences of not doing the same.
In 'The Annals of Imperial Rome', Tacitus aptly notes: 'The more corrupt the state, the more numerous the laws'. The key to combat crime is not more laws but an effective, fast-track and even-handed enforcement of the existing criminal procedure and anti-terrorism code. Ayn Rand writes in 'Atlas Shrugged': 'Just pass the kind of laws that can neither be observed nor enforced nor objectively interpreted and you create a nation of law-breakers and then you cash in on the guilt'.
Pakistan's institutions and enforcing mechanisms are totally corrupted and compromised. The fallout remains a nation encouraged to become law-breakers. This phenomenon is epitomized from the decades of brutal bloodshed in Karachi to its reduction to a landfill. Another barometer, if it does not burn out, to gauge our law-breaking tendencies is the jaywalkers and the traffic on our streets.
The British left us with an efficient police system ably assisted by an effective CID. Their success was due to, apart from total absence of political interference, personnel consisting of locals in the policed area. They knew the area and the people within like the back of their hand. Our police force selection itself has remained plagued with political and monetary considerations since decades. Police officers were deployed courtesy their political patronage; their call of duty to serve their masters only. Crime galore was the logical outcome.
Dr Gary Slutkin, an epidemiologist, apart from working with the Global Program on AIDS, covered 40 refugee camps in Somalia for three years. He was one of six doctors looking after over a million people. The major threat to these people was an outbreak of cholera and the onset of tuberculosis, both highly infectious diseases. The prevention / containment efforts were dependent on updated data and strictly followed preventive measures. The resulting effort bore admirable results.
Back in Chicago, the then murder capital of the US, Dr Slutkin decided to use his experience to prevent crime. Seeing the crime related data, Dr Slutkin's experience led him to the conclusion that, 'Epidemic curves are the same (as crime), the clustering. In fact, one event leads to another, which is diagnostic of a contagious process. Flu causes more flu, colds more colds and violence causes more violence. Behavior is formed by modeling and copying'.
Dr Slutkin's prevention strategy was based on: interrupting transmission, preventing future spread and changing group norms. He hired locals, dubbed 'violence interrupters' to patrol the streets, meeting people and developing links. Their goal was to prevent a violent act. In 2000, Dr Slutkin launched 'Cure Violence' in Chicago's West Garfield Park neighborhood. The first year saw a drop of 67 percent in homicides alone. The US department of Justice found a drop of 73 percent in shootings and killings at certain crime hotspots.
Today, Cure Violence is part of the public health department of University of Illinois. It operates successfully in 13 Chicago neighborhoods. The success of the program has seen it spreading successfully to Baltimore, Los Angeles and New York. Cure Violence has also helped countries in Latin America, Middle East and the Caribbean Islands to adopt effective community based public safety solutions.
In Pakistan, unfortunately, each issue invariably morphs into a political, provincial, sectarian or gender based sparring match. Lost in between is the aim of tackling the menace which metastasizes due to this infighting. Whatever knee jerk reactions we can muster are testament to a total void of administrative ability and politicized, corrupt institutions. This leads to the prime minister or chief ministers 'taking notice', a euphemism for the gaping administrative void, of an issue that should essentially have been the mandated assignment of a SHO or municipal official.
As it is, cleaning Karachi nullahs, the responsibility of a municipal officer, has the prime minister, chief justice and chief of army staff pooling their precious time and resources. They try to ensure what now stands practically undoable due to decades' long criminal connivance of state institutions and the apathy of the people. We did not arrive at this juncture in a single day or due to the criminal neglect of an individual.
The unchallenged criminal default of our rulers has been ably abetted by us, the masses. This has created mafias that spawned illegal buildings, encroachments, crime and a freefall in the health, education and social service sectors. All this, yet we all danced, as if drugged, to the fiddle of all the Neros that ruled the roost for decades. Unfortunately, each one of us is culpable as to where we stand today as a state and society.
Coming back to crime, a major contributing factor has been the failure of our criminal justice system. The still-at-large Abid, the main accused in the recent despicable act, was on a crime spree since 2014 despite being named, involved and apprehended in similar cases. The frequent unnerving revelation that a finally (after public outcry) punished criminal had been let off repeatedly leads to mob retributive justice and vigilantism. This is a stark reflection of the total erosion of public faith in the state and its law-enforcing institutions.
Mark Twain famously said: 'A crime persevered in a thousand centuries ceases to be a crime, and becomes a virtue. This is the law of custom, and custom supersedes all other forms of law'. A thousand centuries seems overly stretched even for those times. In this age of the all-encompassing negativity bias, patronized crime becomes a 'necessity' and a 'right' in no time. An example all of us face daily here; corruption, a vice, has become the only 'virtue' that gets things done.
We have to establish a community that predicts and prevents crime rather than being overwhelmed by a deluge in a compromised system. The media can play a crucial role in educating the people by means which resonate with them. Our production houses should take a break from perpetual love troikas and saas /bahu manipulations. Given their capabilities and following they should produce content that educates people and propagates the virtues of good.
Apart from individual precautions, a strong local government system can go a long way in helping combat crime by preventive measures and community policing. As it is, our 'qaideen' are loath to devolve power to the grassroots for obvious reasons. It is crucially important that we do not wait for atrocious acts to jolt us out of our stupor. We have to modulate our lives and stand up against mafias, crimes and their patrons on a daily basis. Only then can we ensure a system that does not glorify or protect criminals.",Bias Crime

 198 Perceptions of Victimization Risk and Fear of Crime Among Lesbians and Gay Men Melanie D. Otis University of Kentucky, Lexington Research on fear of crime has evolved to suggest the existence of a complex relationship between individual, lifestyle, and contextual factors. Past work generally focuses on predominantly heterosexual populations; this study exam- ines correlates of fear of crime and perceptions of risk among a sample of 272 self-identified lesbians and gay men. Higher levels of perceived risk and fear of victimization were found among females, persons in neighborhoods characterized by incivility, and persons who had experienced previous victim- ization. Perceived risks of personal and property victimization were similar for males and females. Contrary to past research, women did not seem to view all types of potential victimization as opportunities for sexual assault. Instead, fear of victimization was offense specific--past personal victimization predicted fear of future personal victimization, and past property victimization predicted fear of future property victimization. Similarities and differences between current findings and suggestions for future research are discussed. Keywords: fear of crime; lesbians and gay men; victimization; perceived risk; sexual minorities During the past two decades, a growing body of research has focused on describing, defining, and explaining fear of crime. Although findings have been equivocal, in general, research has suggested women and the elderly (e.g., Bennett & Flavin, 1994; McGarrell, Giacomazzi, & Thurman, 1997) are more likely to fear victimization. Within this research, much has been made of the apparent disjuncture between the levels of fear of victim- ization expressed by women and the elderly and their actual experiences of victimization as documented in victimization surveys and official crime Journal of Interpersonal Violence Volume 22 Number 2 February 2007 198-217 © 2007 Sage Publications 10.1177/0886260506295346 http://jiv.sagepub.com hosted at http://online.sagepub.com Author's Note: Please address all correspondence to Melanie D.

Whereas this disjuncture has been characterized as an irrational fear of an unlikely event, some efforts to explain the phenomenon have argued that the higher levels of fear expressed can be attributed, at least in part, to greater physical vulnerability felt by individuals in these groups. The vulnerability hypothesis has been but one of many arguments forwarded to explain this paradox (e.g., Hough & Mayhew, 1983). More recently, however, some researchers have questioned the suggestion that physical vulnerability to potential victimization is the exclusive or even pri- mary explanation for increased levels of fear found among women. Instead, it has been suggested that conceptual and methodological flaws in victim- ization research may fail to capture many of the sources of women's fear of victimization--and thus fail to count numerous actual experiences of ver- bal and/or physical aggression that generally fall outside the parameters of many studies. For instance, Pain (1997) argues that the pervasiveness of domestic violence and sexual harassment serve to create a climate in which women feel fearful of a broad range of potential threats. When coupled with prevailing social attitudes that seem to ignore if not condone these daily threats, women are left feeling socially isolated and marginalized by this ever-present risk of violation. Against this backdrop, a woman's expressed fear of victimization may ultimately be in line with her lived experience of being the target of a myriad of verbal and/or physical attacks. As efforts to untangle and clarify these relationships have been under- taken, the vast majority of research has focused on individuals who are either specifically identified as or presumed to be heterosexual. As a result, much less is known about the experiences of victimization and its consequences for lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, and transgender (LGBT) persons--individuals who are arguably particularly vulnerable to potential victimization because of their marginalized and stigmatized status as sexual minorities (Pain, 1991, 2000). Although not specifically focused on fear of victimization and poten- tial predictors of such fear, during the past decade, a limited amount of work has begun to explore other aspects of victimization among sexual minorities (e.g., Comstock, 1991; Herek & Berrill, 1992; Herek, Cogan, & Gillis, 2002; Otis & Skinner, 1996). Extant work on the impact of victimization in the lives of LGBT persons highlights both similarities and differences in relation to experiences of non-LGBT persons. Similarities and differences that Pain and others suggest may be attributable to the impact of social exclusion and oppression. Against this backdrop, the current study seeks to explore the rela- tionship between a number of previously studied predictors (i.e., gender, age, past victimization, neighborhood incivilities, and population density) and perceptions of risk of victimization and fear of victimization among members Otis / Lesbians and Gay Men 199 of a particularly vulnerable and marginalized population--self-identified lesbians and gay men living in a rural state. Literature Review Fear of Victimization and Perceptions of Risk One area in which there has been substantial debate focuses on defini- tional and conceptual problems relating to the study of fear of victimiza- tion. Increasingly, researchers have argued that much of the disparity in findings identified in past research can be attributed to flawed measures and a failure to distinguish between multiple dimensions of threats of victim- ization (Wilcox Rountree, 1998). Explorations of the seemingly paradoxical relationship between gender, age, and fear of crime have fueled efforts to clarify the distinction between fear of victimization and perceived risk of victimization (Ferraro & LaGrange, 1987; Warr, 1987). Within this literature, risk assessments are viewed as largely a cognitive evaluative process, the outcome of which influences one's emotional response of feeling fearful. Ferraro and LaGrange (1987, 1992) argue that past measures failed to distinguish between one's awareness of like- lihood of victimization and the psychological response to feelings of fear, thus contributing to misinterpretations and/or misattributions of age and gender dif- ferences in levels of fear. Their research suggests that young people in general, and young men specifically, believe that they are, in fact, at higher risk for vic- timization than their elderly counterparts. This cognitive perception of risk did not, however, translate to a consistent emotional response of fear of victim- ization. The disjuncture is partly explained by differences in individuals' per- ceptions of their vulnerability to potentially negative consequences as a result of being victimized. Two concerns are highlighted by extant research. First, the authors argue that past research suggesting that older people are more fearful of crime than younger people might have failed to actually measure fear of victim- ization (Ferraro & LaGrange, 1987). Specifically, they propose that a cog- nitive perception of one's crime risk should be treated as a distinct factor separate from a concept of fear of victimization. Second, their work sug- gests that perception of risk of victimization should be conceptualized as an intervening variable mediating the relationship between various sociode- mographic variables, indirect and direct victimization, neighborhood inci- vilities, and the subsequent outcome of fear of crime (Ferraro, 1995; Ferraro & LaGrange, 1987). 200 Journal of Interpersonal Violence Individual, Lifestyle, and Contextual Factors As previously noted, research suggests that perceived risk of victimiza- tion and expressed levels of fear often vary based on a number of micro- level variables such as gender, age, and race. Efforts to articulate the meaning of that link between sociodemographic variables and fear of vic- timization (e.g., LaGrange & Ferraro, 1989; Warr, 1990) have focused on similarities and differences that can be found in the routine daily activities (Cohen & Felson, 1979) and lifestyle patterns (Hindelang, Gottfredson, & Garafalo, 1978) of individuals who share similar demographic profiles. One interpretation of these findings suggests that these individual-level fac- tors are indicators of meaningful patterns of exposure to potential victim- ization that relate to commonalties found in the lifestyles of individuals with shared demographic profiles and similar types and levels of activity (e.g., going to bars, staying home; Cohen & Felson, 1979). The similarities in lifestyle patterns and routine daily activities translate into variations in the likelihood that one will encounter a motivated offender, and thus, expe- rience victimization. Recent research examining individuals' efforts to reduce their potential risk of victimization have focused on many of these same factors. For instance, studies have found that women may reduce the amount of time spent engaging in particular activities and/or the amount of time they spend in certain venues in an effort to reduce their potential for victimization (Pain, 1997; Painter, 1992). Past experiences with victimization also play a role in perceptions of victimization risk and fear of future victimization. Whereas some research has suggested that any form of victimization may potentially lead to a global increase in fear, Wilcox Rountree (1998) found support for a distinct offense-specific impact on victimization concerns. In her study of Seattle neighborhoods, she found that violent personal victimization increased concerns for both future personal and property victimization but failed to find a similar impact for past experiences of burglary. One potential expla- nation for this finding may lie in the potential for trauma associated with direct (personal) victimization. As such, the impact of personal victimiza- tion may be more pervasive than the more impersonal experience of bur- glary or other property-related crimes (Wilcox Rountree, 1998). Contextual factors and spatial characteristics also play an important role in predicting perceived risk and fear of crime. For instance, higher levels of fear of victimization have also been found among individuals living in areas characterized by community disorder (LaGrange, Ferraro, & Supancic, 1992; Skogan & Maxfield, 1981). Both physical and social aspects of communities Otis / Lesbians and Gay Men 201 become important factors in understanding differences in people's perceptions of their risk of being victimized and their feelings of fearfulness (Bennett & Flavin, 1994; Wilson & Kelling, 1982). Signs of neighborhood incivility reflect a broader set of concerns that might exist in a given community, suggesting that fear of crime may reflect perceptions of an overall problem of commu- nity disorganization. Independent of any personal contact with victimiza- tion, many individuals may presume a high crime rate if a number of signs of community decay and disorder exist (LaGrange et al., 1992). LaGrange and colleagues also found these indicators of neighborhood incivility to be stronger predictors of perceived risk of victimization than fear of crime. Similarly, Wilcox Rountree and Land (1996) found neighborhood incivili- ties to increase fear of crime among respondents who were actually aware of specific cases of victimization. Thus, independent of variations in risk that might accompany diverse social statuses and participation in high- or low- risk activities, the community context provides residents with additional information that may contribute to perceptions of risk and fearfulness. Prior research has also identified population density as a predictor of variation in levels of fear of crime (Liska, Lawrence, & Sanchirico, 1982; Skogan & Maxfield, 1981). Changing patterns of population migration and increases in population density may lead to feelings of disconnect from one's neighbors. Thus, higher rates of fear of crime found in metropolitan areas have been attributed, in part, to this sense of disconnect or alienation that may be felt by urban inhabitants (Skogan, 1986). Fear of Victimization Among Sexual Minorities To date, little is known about the factors that predict fear of crime among sexual minorities. In a study of the impact of victimization on a sample of lesbians and gay men, Otis and Skinner (1996) documented the deleterious effects of past victimization on mental well-being. The relationship, how- ever, between victimization risks and predictor variables was not a part of the study. Similarly, whereas Herek and colleagues (2002) have provided some insight into the characteristics of crimes experienced by LGB persons-- with a specific focus on the experience of hate crimes--their research did not explore the relationship between victimization experiences and future concerns relating to risk and/or fear of subsequent victimization. To begin to address these gaps in the literature, this study tests offense- specific factors related to fear of personal and property crime among a sample of lesbians and gay men living in a rural state. The analysis includes both individual and contextual factors that relate to lifestyle, routine activities, 202 Journal of Interpersonal Violence past victimization experience, and neighborhood characteristics. Past vic- timization experience (personal and property), perceived neighborhood disorder, participation in high-risk (alcohol-related and nonalcohol-related) and low-risk daily activities, and lifestyle- and exposure-related sociodemo- graphic variables are included as exogenous variables. Drawing on extant lit- erature, perception of risk and fear of victimization are examined separately. Thus, this study seeks to contribute to our knowledge of fear of victimiza- tion among lesbians and gay men by addressing the following questions: (a) Do different factors predict fear of victimization versus perception of victimization risk? and (b) Are there offense-specific (personal versus prop- erty victimization) differences in levels of fear of future victimization? Method Participants and Procedures Respondents for this study are a nonprobability sample of self-defined lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals living in households located in and around two metropolitan cities in a southern state (2000 county popula- tion sizes were 250,000 and 683,000). Participants were recruited using a multipronged approach, including organizational mailing lists, snowball sampling, and a convenience sample at a local LGBT Pride gathering. Two hundred ninety-eight self-identified lesbians and gay men partici- pated in the study. Respondents ranged in age from 19 to 75 years, with an average age of 35.7 years and an average number of 15.4 years of edu- cation. The sample was 42.6% lesbian and 57.3% gay male, and the majority of the respondents described themselves as White (93.9%). The median individual income was between $15,000 and $19,999, and 74.5% of the sample indicated that they were employed full time. The majority of the sample indicated that they were currently in a same-sex relation- ship (61.7%), with slightly fewer than half (48.7%) indicating that they currently lived with their same-sex partner. Slightly more than three fourths (78%) of the sample indicated that they lived in a city (more than 250,000 people) or suburb, and 12.2% lived in rural areas or small towns (fewer than 10,000 people). This study is part of a larger longitudinal study that examined a myriad of social issues and experiences impacting the lives of lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals living in the state. Regardless of how they were contacted (organizational mailing lists, a snowball sample involving community Otis / Lesbians and Gay Men 203 members, or at the community event), respondents completed an anony- mous self-report survey and returned it to the principal investigator. Measures Fear of personal and property victimization. Fear of victimization is based on a measure suggested by Ferraro and LaGrange (1987). For each of nine items, a Likert-type scale was used (1 = not afraid at all to 10 = very afraid) to indicate the degree to which the respondents were afraid of becoming victims of specific types of crime. Fear-of-personal-victimization items included ""How afraid are you of someone . . . taking something from you by force . . . beating you up . . . sexually assaulting you?"" Items measuring fear of property crime included ""How afraid are you of . . . having something stolen from you while you are away from home . . . having your property vandalized?"" Perceived risk of victimization. Respondents were also asked to rate the likelihood of experiencing personal or property victimization. Two indices measuring perceived risk of personal victimization and perceived risk of property victimization were constructed based on the same series of state- ments used to construct the fear-of-personal-victimization and fear-of- property-victimization indices. For the series of statements, respondents rated on a scale of 1 (not at all likely) to 10 (very likely) the likelihood that they would in fact be victims of specific types of victimization, such as being sexually assaulted by someone of the opposite sex, being verbally abused, or having property vandalized. Lifestyle, Routine Activities, and Social-Context Variables To assess past experiences of personal victimization, respondents indi- cated whether each of 13 different types of victimization had happened dur- ing the past 2 years (no = 0, yes = 1). Victimization that occurred in face-to-face interaction, such as physical or sexual assault, threats of vio- lence, and robbery, are combined to create a dichotomous measure of per- sonal (contact) victimization (0 = no personal victimization, 1 = one or more experiences). Noncontact victimization such as burglary and vandal- ism of personal property are combined to create a dichotomous measure of property (noncontact) victimization (0 = no property victimization, 1 = one or more experiences). Based on past findings examining the offense-specific nature of fear of victimization, past victimization experience (either personal 204 Journal of Interpersonal Violence Otis / Lesbians and Gay Men 205 or property) is expected to be positively related to fear of personal victim- ization. However, only property victimization is expected to be predictive of fear of property victimization. Routine activities. Research suggests that a number of individual-level, lifestyle-related variables may impact an individual's risk of victimization. In keeping with arguments suggested by Cohen and Felson (1979) and Garofalo (1987), frequency of participation in activities that take place in high-risk public space, or ""hot spots"" of crime, as well as time spent in less risky public activities and time spent at home are included in the analysis as indicators of victimization opportunity. Responses ranged from 1, indi- cating no participation, to 7, indicating participation many times per week. Taken together, these micro-level lifestyle/exposure and routine-activity measures may provide a clearer picture of probable victimization risks that might elicit feelings of fear from respondents. Participation in high-risk activities is expected to positively relate to fear of personal and property victimization. Conversely, time spent at home (low-risk activity) is expected to negatively relate to fear of victimization. Individual characteristics. Based on past research, four individual-level variables were included to assess lifestyle/vulnerability factors. These vari- ables included gender (dummy coded, male = 1), age (continuous, range = 19 to 75 years), relationship status (dummy coded, single = 1), and personal income (ordinal, 1 = no earnings to 12 = more than $50,000 per year). Ecological context. Neighborhood incivility is measured with a series of questions addressing perceived problems in the immediate neighborhood environment. The neighborhood-problems scale (range = 9 to 27) included questions that asked, ""How great a problem are . . . trash and litter . . . loose dogs . . . inconsiderate or disruptive neighbors . . ."" and so on. Each problem is coded 1 = not at all, 2 = somewhat, and 3 = serious (Cronbach's alpha = ­.80). Perceived neighborhood incivilities are expected to relate to increased levels of fear of victimization. Population density was assessed as (a) rural farm, (b) rural nonfarm, (c) town (fewer than 10,000), (d) small city (10,000 to 100,000), (e) suburb, or (f) city (more than 100,000). Past research supports a positive relation- ship between increased population density and fear of crime. However, many LGBT persons move from rural areas because of fear of discrimination and victimization. Thus, fear of crime is expected to negatively relate to popu- lation density for this sample. 206 Journal of Interpersonal Violence Results Descriptive Information and Analytic Plan Analysis began with the examination of bivariate relationships among all study variables. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analyses were used to explore the relationships between individual-level and contextual factors and perceived risk and fear of victimization. All analyses were com- pleted using SPSS version 11.0. Table 1 contains zero-order correlations, means, and standard deviations for all study variables. Six of the 10 vari- ables demonstrated significant bivariate relationships with the dependent variable. Of note, the relationships between fear of personal victimization and gender, being single, spending time home alone, and population den- sity were not significant. The strongest bivariate relationship exists between fear of personal victimization and perceived risk of victimization (r = .724). Predicting Fear of Personal Victimization Path analysis, including personal victimization, routine activities, con- textual factors, individual characteristics, and perceived risk of victimiza- tion, was conducted to test the fully recursive model predicting fear of personal victimization (see Table 2). Direct effects were calculated by regressing fear of personal victimization on the 10 predictors in the equa- tion. In this analysis, only neighborhood incivilities ( = .158, p .001) and perceived risk of personal victimization ( = .660, p .001) were signifi- cant predictors. Largely because of the influence of perceived risk of vic- timization on fear of personal victimization, the model explained 55.4% of the variance in fear of personal victimization. Because perceived risk of personal victimization is conceptualized as an intervening variable in the model, a second analysis regressed fear of per- sonal victimization on the remaining nine factors. After removing perceived risk of personal victimization from the analysis, four of the nine remaining variables made significant contributions to the overall model. The percep- tion of neighborhood incivilities continued to be the strongest predictor, and those perceiving greater neighborhood problems had higher levels of fear of personal victimization ( = .333, p .001). In addition, past experience of personal victimization ( = .182, p .05), personal income ( = ­.841, p .001), and gender ( = ­.122, p .05) all made significant contributions in the expected directions. Further decomposition of the paths found notable indirect effects on fear of personal victimization for past personal victimization ( = .178), time Table1 Zero-orderedCorrelations,Means,andStandardDeviationsforallStudyVariables(N==272) 12345678910MeanSD 1.Victimization1.00.20.40 2.Lesbian/gaybars.194**1.003.351.75 3.Homealone­.067.151*1.005.621.52 4.Incivility.272**.114*­.152*1.0011.462.76 5.Populationdensity­.004.092.175*.0531.004.281.27 6.Gender.030.239**.118*.081­.0891.00.57.50 7.Age­.132*­.270**.073­.182*­.002.0491.0034.669.77 8.Single.029.114*.058.073­.105.323**­.0431.00.34.47 9.Personalincome­.155**­.105.006­.169*­.059.007.351**­.0921.006.912.68 10.Perceivedrisk.373**.157*.024.348**­.089­.011­.199**.016­.246**1.0013.778.33 11.Fearofvictimization.296**.117*­.004.383**­.026­.072­.145*­.015­.230**.724**28.9315.04 *p.05;**p.001. 207 Table2 OLSRegressionUnstandardizedCoefficients,StandardErrors,andStandardized CoefficientsforModelPredictingFearofPersonalVictimizationandFearofPropertyVictimization AmongLesbiansandGayMen(N==272) FearofPersonalVictimizationFearofPropertyVictimization b/s.e.b/s.e.b/s.e.b/s.e.

The effect of gender on fear of personal victimization was largely direct, with no significant gender dif- ferences found for perceived risk of personal victimization (see Table 3). This finding is in contrast with past research indicating that men recognize themselves to be at greater risk than women, whereas women express higher levels of fear. Only the latter was supported in this study. The find- ing related to population density is also noteworthy for its contrast to past research. The relationship between fear of personal victimization and pop- ulation density was as hypothesized, with levels of fear decreasing as pop- ulation density increased. Fear of Property Victimization OLS regression analysis was also used to examine the relationship between fear of property victimization, experiences of property victimiza- tion, routine activities, contextual factors, and individual characteristics (Table 2). Only neighborhood incivilities ( = .301, p .05) and past prop- erty victimization ( = .240, p .05) were significantly predictive of fear of property victimization (Adj. R2 = .173). The inclusion of risk of property victimization as an intervening variable increased the explanatory ability of the model significantly (Adj. R2 = .522). Whereas past experience of prop- erty victimization remained significant ( = .100, p .05), the majority of the variance in fear of property victimization was explained by perceived risk ( = .651, p .05). An examination of the decomposed paths further clarifies the role of neighborhood incivilities on fear of property victimization; the majority of its effect came indirectly through variance of perceived risk of victimization. This finding suggests that individuals sensing a higher level of neighborhood incivilities are more likely to feel fearful of victimization largely as a result of their evaluation of potential risk (Wilcox Rountree, 1998). Offense-Specific Fear of Victimization A final set of analyses was undertaken to explore the question of the importance of viewing fear of victimization as offense specific (Wilcox Rountree, 1998); separate analyses examined the influence of past personal-victimization experience on fear of property victimization and past property victimization on fear of personal victimization (see Table 4).

Unlike past studies, property victimization ( = .149) was a significant predictor of fear of personal victimization. Similar to past research, higher levels of reported neighborhood incivilities and lower levels of reported personal income sig- nificantly predicted an increase in fear of personal victimization. The inclu- sion of personal-victimization experience in the equation predicting fear of personal victimization had little impact on the overall findings. In the final analysis including all variables, the strongest effect was for perceived risk of victimization ( = .682), again supporting the suggestion that fear is mediated by current risk evaluations, independent of past victimization experiences. In the analysis examining effect of past experience of personal victimiza- tion on fear of property crime, findings were also in contrast to those reported in previous studies that have suggested that past experiences of personal vic- timization lead to increased fear of both personal and property victimization (Wilcox Rountree, 1998). Specifically, personal victimization failed to signif- icantly affect fear of property crime. Past property victimization ( = .102), neighborhood incivilities ( = .627), and perceived risk of property victim- ization ( = .097) significantly increased fear of property victimization. Discussion Past research has consistently documented higher levels of fear of both personal and property victimization for women when compared to men (Scott, 2003; Warr, 1985). Many have argued that the paradoxical reaction of fear of victimization in the absence of experiences of actual victimiza- tion can be explained by women's greater vulnerability to sexual assault and physical injury. These studies, however, have focused on predomi- nantly heterosexual samples. As such, the findings may have minimal util- ity for understanding the lived experience of many lesbians and gay men who may be more likely to be targeted for sexual and/or physical assault as a result of their stigmatized sexual-minority status. The current study sought to explore potential similarities and differences between the general population (largely heterosexual) that is typically represented in research and members of this stigmatized group. To that end, the author explored the relationship between a number of individual-level factors (i.e., gender, age, income), lifestyle factors (i.e., going to bars), and contextual factors (i.e., neighborhood incivilities) and perceptions of victimization risk and fear of victimization in a nonprobability sample of self-identified lesbians and gay men living in a rural state. Otis / Lesbians and Gay Men 213 Consistent with past research, women in the study were found to be more fearful of personal victimization than were men. It is notable, how- ever, that the effect of gender was low and fairly equally balanced in terms of indirect and direct effects. Additionally, unlike many past studies, the men and women in the study perceived themselves to be at similar levels of risk. A number of factors may serve to balance lesbians' and gay men's per- ceptions of potential risk of victimization. First, the potential for gay men to be targeted for hate crimes may serve to negate many of the arguments suggested about the source of male-female differences in concerns about potential vulnerability to victimization. In other words, gay men's increased likelihood of being targeted for sexual violence as well as physical and/or verbal assault may serve to narrow the gender-gap that is typically found in victimization and fear-of-crime research involving the general population. Simultaneously, it can be argued that many of the same sociocultural fac- tors that contribute to women's sense of vulnerability, social isolation, and exclusion within society are evident in the lives of gay men. For lesbians, however, social isolation and vulnerability to harassment and threats of vic- timization may be magnified by their devalued status both as women and sexual minorities. These assessments are largely speculative, however, and suggest the need for continued exploration of the relationship between gender and fear of crime. The importance of lifestyle factors relating to individual characteristics (i.e., gender, age, income, being single) and participation in routine activities (i.e., going to bars, spending time home alone) in explaining perceptions of victimization risk was only partially supported in the analyses, though all of the relationships were in the direction hypothesized. The fact that neither age nor being single significantly contributed to explaining differences in fear of victimization may be related to certain unique aspects of the lives of lesbians and gay men. Past findings relating to these factors address antic- ipated lifestyle similarities and developmental expectations that may be less relevant for many lesbians and gay men. Whereas a complete discussion of ""coming out"" is beyond the scope of this article, developmental models articulating the process have identified a number of commonalities that hold true for most lesbians and gay men, regardless of their chronological ages. Early stages of ""coming out"" may be related to increased involvement in dating and going to clubs and bars--activities often associated with younger adults. Similarly, both single and coupled lesbians and gay men may spend time socializing in gay/lesbian bars--a core social institution in many cities--thus, potentially reducing the variation in perceived risk and fear of victimization often associated with these activities. In fact, as a pseudo­community center, bars that predominantly cater to sexual minorities 214 Journal of Interpersonal Violence may provide a sense of safety and security that is less available in other public venues. In spite of the consistent findings related to ""hot spots"" of crime and vic- timization, the current study failed to find a significant relationship between increased time spent in LGBT bars and perceived risk or fear of personal victimization. The important cultural role of the LGBT bar in the commu- nity may also explain the lack of significance of this ""high risk"" activity in this analysis. The fact that increased time spent home alone was positively related to perceived risk of victimization but not fear of personal victim- ization may relate to the potential for those who are fearful of victimization to participate in protective behaviors (Liska, Sanchirico, & Reed, 1988). This study, however, does not entirely support this contention. Past research on the impact of participation in protective behaviors has typically found that such actions relate to increased levels of fear (Scott, 2003). Whereas the relationship between staying home alone and fear of personal victim- ization was positive, it was not significant. In this case, it may be argued that having taken such action, the individuals actually contributed to increased feelings of safety. Whereas there are some significant direct effects on fear of victimization, this analysis suggests that individuals are rational actors whose fear is based on an actual perception of risk. Furthermore, for the gay men and lesbians in this study, the two strongest contributors to that perception are having expe- rienced personal and/or property victimization in the past and the presence of signs of neighborhood incivility--two factors that seem to suggest the possi- bility of victimization as a legitimate concern. Absent in this analysis is any measure of the respondent's awareness of the victimization experiences of others--a particularly relevant factor in a population that is often targeted for bias-motivated crime (Berrill, 1990; Jenness & Broad, 1997). Finally, somewhat in contrast with Wilcox Rountree's (1998) findings about the offense-specific nature of crime, we found that fear of personal or property victimization was related to having experienced similar types of victimization. Specifically, past property victimization increased feelings of risk of property victimization and fearfulness of future property crime. That concern was not carried over, however, to seemingly unrelated con- cerns for personal victimization. Limitations and Suggestions for Future Research The lesbians and gay men who participated in this project cannot be assumed to be representative of the population as a whole. We believe that the multipronged sampling approach used contributed to a sample that is arguably more diverse than those found in studies that relied on single methodologies and urban respondents, however. That said, the stigmatiza- tion and discrimination experienced by many LGBT people continues to contribute to problems of accessibility. Those who are willing to participate in research may be more ""out"" and potentially less fearful than those who are less open about their sexual-minority status. In fact, many of the same concerns that influence LGBT persons' willingness to report victimization to the police (i.e., fear of exposure, concern about loss of employment, etc.) may often influence decisions about participation in research. Whereas one of the strengths of this project is the fact that the sample of lesbians and gay men studied did not live in a large metropolitan area (e.g., San Francisco, New York City), it also raises a cautionary note in terms of past research. Many of the studies that contributed to the analytic frame- work of this project have been conducted in much larger urban areas. Given the significance of neighborhood context, future research should seek to explicate the experience of lesbians and gay men in a myriad of community settings. The study is also limited by the fact that a recently (past 2 years) mea- sure of past victimization was used. Guided by recent studies suggesting that fear-of-victimization and risk assessments may be based largely on immediate circumstances and the current environmental contexts, we focused the analysis on recent experiences. Subsequent analysis may con- sider differences in fear-of-victimization and risk assessments among indi- viduals who have experienced serious, life-threatening victimization as compared to those who have experienced other types of personal and/or property crimes, while also considering temporal effects.

There were many other antisemitic incidents across the United States. A synagogues service in Newington, Connecticut was Zoom-bombed. They put up a caricature of the Jew with a big nose. It was just so upsetting, said Temple Sinai Rabbi Jeffrey Bennett, describing just some of the hateful messaging. Police are investigating the situation. In Florida, two synagogues were defaced with swastikas. Also desecrated, were parts of Synagogue made from Jerusalem stone a special limestone brought from Jerusalem and so the congregation can feel closer to Israel. In Ohio, a mural honoring victims of police brutality, including the late George Floyd was defaced with a swastika. On the back of the mural, the words Welcome to Athens Now Leave were written in red.
Switzerland
Swiss Jews increasingly concerned about antisemitism, according to recent survey
When: July
Where: Switzerland
What: The Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW) survey examining Swiss Jews perceptions of antisemitism found that a slight majority of Swiss Jews (51.5%) believe that antisemitism is a pressing social problem, and a strong majority (75%) believe that the problem has worsened over the past five years. Nearly half of the respondents said they had witnessed threats or insults to other Jews online. Click here to read more.

Ukrainian Jewish community shaken by attack on Mariupol synagogue
When: July 28th
Where: Mariupol
What: A man who attempted to enter into a synagogue with an ax was disarmed and chased away by the synagogue's security guard. Media reports indicated that the perpetrator later returned, this time throwing feces at the building.
In response to the attack, the Jewish Confederation of Ukraine expressed its outrage, saying: it is noteworthy that a criminal who broke into a synagogue attacked Jews with an axe in his hand, as the thugs of the past did. And it is symbolic that this attack was committed on the eve of the most tragic day for the Jews, the ninth of Av. Click here to read more.

Introduction
Studies of bias-motivated offending in criminology, termed as ‘hate studies’, have given rise to a plethora of research on the parameters of such crimes (see Hall, 2013; Perry, 2001) and their symbolic capacity within criminal justice processes (Mason, 2013). Further, hate studies have provided the opportunity for criminology to consider the boundaries of its project (Jenness and Grattet, 2001), identifying the necessity for criminology to re-engage with issues of racism (Dixon and Ray, 2007), and the social harms engendered by bias-motivated behaviours that are not defined as crimes (Tombs, 2018). With the intention of furthering discussion in this area, this article identifies the harms of hate experienced by Gypsies and Travellers that are multiple and varied, normalized and complex. By utilizing a critical hate studies approach (James and McBride, 2018) and drawing on empirical data gathered in a rural area of England, the article considers explanations for the hate experienced by Gypsies and Travellers. The harms of hate discussed here constitute subjective harms that manifest as crimes, systemic harms that are inherent within processes and structures of governance, and symbolic harms expressed via speech and language (Žižek, 2008). The article is therefore able to present a critical analysis of hate harms that recognizes the human need to flourish, rather than simply to survive, in late modernity.
The article will initially set out the existing ‘problem’ presented by Gypsies and Travellers, wherein their experiences of criminalization and victimization overlap and must be considered within the context of the tensions between (and misunderstandings of) sedentarism and nomadism. The article specifically deals with issues of race, crime and victimization by virtue of discussing the diverse communities represented by the limiting moniker of ‘Gypsies and Travellers’. Further, the article acknowledges and challenges hierarchies of difference that exist within legislation, policies and practice, and considers how a more nuanced approach, informed by the perspectives of Gypsies and Travellers themselves serves better to appreciate their lived experience (Phillips and Bowling, 2008). The article then goes on to provide a framework for analysis that is informed by ultra-realist criminology (Hall and Winlow, 2015).1 In doing so, the article responds to a call for critical thinking within hate studies (Perry, 2006).
The harms of hate are elaborated in this article in relation to the realms of recognition human subjects require to flourish, that are love, esteem and respect (Yar, 2012). By approaching the harms of hate in this way, it is possible to identify and draw out the omnipresence of neoliberal capitalism on the lived experiences of Gypsies and Travellers as its vagaries serve to block access to true recognition of human needs (Honneth, 1996). The article, therefore, identifies how criminological theory can move beyond existing debates in studies of race and ethnicity and engage more effectively with the wider social sciences, specifically psychology and sociology. In doing so, the article intends to identify a nuanced approach that acknowledges the unique nature of Gypsies’ and Travellers’ experiences as a specific minority perspective. However, the article also makes a universal point about the nature of human subjectivities based on a consideration of the fundamental formation of the human self.
Methodology
The theoretical approach here is based on a comprehensive reading of literature in the areas of identity, hate studies, criminology and Romani studies. In order to illuminate the theoretical framework the article draws on evidence gathered in 2015 on the harms of hate experienced by Gypsies and Travellers that was part of a wider research study on the accommodation needs of Gypsies and Travellers in the south-west of England (Southern et al., 2015). In agreement with the study funders,2 that research incorporated a small survey of Gypsies’ and Travellers’ experiences of hate behaviours, including both hate incidents and hate crimes. The survey gathered data on what had happened and whether Gypsies and Travellers had reported the hate they had experienced to any formal or community reporting agencies, and if not, why not. The survey data incorporated closed and open questions on numbers of hate behaviours, as well as their locations, reporting, responses of agencies reported to and perceptions of hate victimization. A Gypsy and Traveller support organization carried out the survey alongside the wider accommodation needs assessment. Respondents completed the survey themselves or received support to complete the survey so that all those sampled could contribute to the research, no matter their levels of literacy (McCaffery, 2009).
The Gypsy and Traveller accommodation assessment was completed by 187 people who lived in a range of accommodation including those who normally resided on approved sites as well as those who lived in illegal spaces. Because there is no existing sampling frame for this population, a snowball sample was utilized which targeted groups in known sites in the first instance and used their contacts to access other, harder to reach, Gypsies and Travellers. Although snowball sampling can be considered unrepresentative, it is a reasonably valid strategy that was sensitive to the shifting population and enabled access to be gained to people living on authorized sites, unauthorized spaces, transit spaces and in bricks and mortar accommodation that tend to be the hardest groups to access (Sturgis, 2008). Of the 187 people that completed the accommodation needs assessment, 79 chose to answer the hate crime questions. Given the high number of questions in the accommodation needs assessment (54 questions) and thus the time taken to complete it, it was surprising and actually gratifying that 79 people were additionally prepared to answer the hate crime questions. It should also be noted that on two incomplete surveys notes were found stating, ‘fearful of repercussion’. Those people who chose to answer the questions self-identified as Romany Gypsies (41%), New Travellers (53%) and others, including Show people (6%), reflecting the proportions of the wider sample of Gypsies and Travellers in the accommodation needs assessment.
In addition to the survey, the research team followed up the hate crime survey with a small number of requests for interviews with respondents. Subsequently, three in-depth interviews with Romany Gypsy and New Travellers were completed. These telephone interviews each lasted for at least an hour and addressed a range of issues highlighted by the survey component of the research.
The ‘problem’ of Gypsies and Travellers
Gypsies, Travellers and Roma constitute the largest minority in Europe (Council of Europe, 2011) and Gypsies and Travellers in the UK have been approximated to comprise 1.5% of the UK population (Greenfields and Smith, 2009). Defining the population of Gypsies and Travellers in the UK has been notoriously problematic. Although in the 2011 census space was provided for those of Romany Gypsy and Irish Traveller status to self-identify, research suggests that those 63,000 people who completed the survey does not equate to their population in full (Cromarty, 2018). Indeed, one of the controversial, and arguably divisive, issues within Gypsy and Traveller studies is the determination of who qualifies as having Gypsy or Traveller identity and thus status. Policy and planning in this regard have served to confuse discussion and identification, and consequently the statistics. Race relations legislation acknowledges Romany Gypsies, Irish Travellers and Scottish Travellers as deserving protection as specific ethnic groups.3 New Travellers and other Travellers, such as Show people, are not protected by this legislation, despite their inter-generational cultural nomadism4 and their ethnicity in the case of Show people (LeedsGATE, 2019). Further, planning policy determines ‘travellers’ [sic] as only those people that are mobile and thus has negated the status of many Gypsies and Travellers, including those recognized as ethnic groups, for planning purposes if they stop travelling on a permanent basis. As noted by James and Southern (2019), this policy has potentially damaging consequences for the most vulnerable Gypsies and Travellers in England and Wales. The old and very young, disabled or infirm, are the least likely Gypsies and Travellers to be mobile and are thus the most likely to have their homes placed at risk within the planning policy framework, unless they are assimilated into bricks and mortar accommodation that is often culturally anathema.5 Overall then, the identity and status of Gypsies and Travellers in the UK is contradictory in policy and legislation. While Gypsies and Travellers themselves, and the civil society organizations that support them, are confident and proud in their cultures, common histories and differences, the state has failed to provide an overarching protective environment for them. Nor has it appropriately accommodated those communities, who have suffered what has been described as an ‘accommodation crisis’ (Cemlyn et al., 2009) throughout the latter part of the 20th century and into the 21st century.
Multiple research studies and articles have evidenced the marginalized position of Gypsies and Travellers in late modernity (Brearley, 2001; Frazer and Marlier, 2011; Greenfields and Brindley, 2016), including the negation of their ‘cultural nomadism’ (James and Southern, 2019: 324; Kabachnik, 2009). Research has also identified the ways in which Gypsies and Travellers have been criminalized as a consequence of planning policy and practice. Indeed, Ellis and McWhirter (2008: 82) refer to the planning process as the ‘critical interface’ between Gypsies and Travellers and the state. The failure to accommodate Gypsies and Travellers has often resulted in them stopping and staying in places that are deemed illegitimate and public order legislation used to move them on via formal eviction or the threat of such eviction. In association with this criminalizing process, the localism agenda of recent coalition and conservative governments has facilitated settled communities’ negative (and often racist) perceptions of Gypsies and Travellers to inform planning processes and thus prevent site provision. The implications of this are multiple as all Gypsies and Travellers, whether living in bricks and mortar accommodation, legal or illegal sites are vilified and the application of racist tropes are applied to them, no matter their ethnicity. Sibley (1988) uses the work of Douglas (1966) to explain the application of societal notions of ‘purity and danger’ to Gypsies and Travellers, and in doing so he notes how they are stigmatized as ‘a threat to the integrity of the collective’ (Sibley, 1988: 410). Thus, the public consciousness reduces Gypsies and Travellers to a negative, racialized ‘other’.
Within the European policy environment lobbying by civil society organizations led to comprehensive EU-wide level policies for Roma6 inclusion that was intended to guide states towards effective inclusionary policy and practice. However, the capacity of these policies to be impactful on the lived experience of Gypsies and Travellers has been questioned (James and Smith, 2017) and UK implementation of the EU Framework for Roma Inclusion has been ‘exceptionally slow’ (National Federation of Gypsy Liaison Groups et al., 2014: 13). In addition, the United Nations International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination periodic report (2016: 6) found that Gypsies, Travellers and Roma in the UK ‘continue to face exclusion and discrimination’. Further, recent research has identified that Gypsy, Traveller and Roma children in England and Wales experience deprivation in relation to their standard of living, education and/or health (Battaglini et al., 2018; EHRC, 2019).
Increasingly, a ‘hate crime’ agenda has provided policy and legislative vehicles for challenging the ill-treatment of Gypsies and Travellers in the UK. Redress for people victimized on the basis of their identity, and associated reporting mechanisms, have been developed that illuminate the extent of such victimization. Based on and informed by the recommendations made by Macpherson (1999) following an enquiry into the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence, the hate crime agenda has developed similarly to other western jurisdictions, most notably the USA (Hall, 2015). Identifying offences motivated by hostility towards a person’s identity, and associated policy frameworks, has functioned symbolically within states to ‘punish, deter and denounce’ hate behaviours (Mason, 2015). Notwithstanding critiques of the hate crime concept (see Jacobs and Potter (1998) for example), the hate crime agenda has rarely been comprehensive in its capacity to challenge all hate as outlined by Wickes et al. (2016), and specifically hate against Gypsies and Travellers for two specific reasons. First, despite the fact that policy encourages the reporting of hate incidents, as well as crimes, it is highly unlikely that they will be reported to agencies due to their regularity and the resilience this engenders (Williams and Tregidga, 2014) and their minor nature and victims’ perceptions of likelihood for redress (Christmann and Wong, 2010). As Iganski (2008) notes and the research below identifies and discusses, many incidents of hate are petty and banal, akin to the everyday racism previously discussed by Essed (1991). Further, Gypsies and Travellers tend to conflate their experiences of hate incidents with discrimination and thus are unlikely to report to agencies that they perceive as prejudiced towards them, including those set up as third parties (James, 2014). This is despite the policy intention for third party reporting mechanisms to breach the gap between socially excluded communities and support agencies. Gypsy and Traveller support agencies’ anecdotal evidence, as well as the evidence presented in the research below, suggest that Gypsies and Travellers are loath to report hate behaviours (House of Commons, 2019). This is troubling, given the cumulative impact of such events and the likelihood of their seriousness increasing (Bowling, 1999).
Second, the complexity of policy and legislation defining Gypsy and Traveller identities means that they are not necessarily, and/or they do not perceive themselves to be, protected by hate crime policy and legislation. Some Gypsies and Travellers are able to report race hate behaviours, as per their protected ethnic identity (such as Romany Gypsies and Irish Travellers). However, those Gypsies and Travellers not recognized within legislation as a specific ethnic group (such as Show people and New Travellers) are thus not incorporated within the race hate protections, despite their cultural, and often ethnic, similarities. This can result in some Gypsies’ and Travellers’ experiences going unrecorded, subsequently not investigated nor supported by the police and other agencies that the flagging of an incident as hate behaviour would otherwise trigger. While some policing agencies do record hate behaviours beyond the five protected categories in legislation that might provide some additional support for all Gypsies and Travellers in those areas, this is not common (Traveller Movement, 2018).
Critical hate studies
‘Critical hate studies’ (James and McBride, 2018) developed as a response to a call by Perry (2006) for greater critical theorizing in hate studies. Further, the perspective grew out of a specific concern that existing critical theorizing (Perry, 2001) was unable to explain the breadth of hate behaviours in society that were both extreme and ‘everyday’ (Essed, 1991; Iganski, 2008) and have been exacerbated by the failure of agencies to implement joined-up, effective responses to bias-motivated behaviours (Chakraborti, 2018; HMICFRS, 2018). Perry’s (2001) work within hate studies has been seminal and has arguably provided the critical backbone to research in this area (Hall, 2015). Perry (2001) argues that hate behaviours serve to reinforce structural boundaries in society that sustain privilege according to race, gender and sexuality. In her analysis, Perry uses Messerschmidt’s (1997) structured-action approach to explain how human subjectivity is informed by hegemonic norms. Critical hate studies acknowledges the need to provide a critical analysis of hate in late modernity underpinned by a nuanced account of human subjectivity, drawing on ultra-realist theorizing (see Hall and Winlow, 2015) to meet that aim.
The critical hate studies perspective acknowledges that the overriding condition of late modern society is the neoliberal capitalist political economy, as identified by critical theorists (Davies, 2017; Harvey, 2005). Neoliberal capitalism has seen a shift in the logic of social organization, from an environment ordered according to political judgement to one ordered by economic evaluation. Structures of power based on race, gender, class and sexuality have therefore increasingly been co-opted to serve the needs of capital in a society that equates value with fiscal success, rather than political prowess. Neoliberal capitalism encourages and engenders flexibility and adaptability, individualism and competitiveness, while ensuring adherence to market principles in delivery of services, and reduction of costs in provision of welfare. Thus, the neoliberal capitalist political economy embraces the power of the individual within the confines of meeting market needs. This shift in the logic ordering the social world (while more complex and nuanced than I am able to give credit to here), has created an environment within which individual identity characteristics are not core determinants of success or failure in life. The power of elites, and thus the power of white propertied men, has been retained within neoliberalism as wealth, production and ownership has been held in the hands of the few as a consequence of the industrial revolution and the colonial project, and their inherent racism and sexism (Cain and Hopkins, 2001). However, within the competitive individualism of neoliberalism, status provided by race, gender or even class or sexuality does not always assure privilege as it can be subverted by the ‘special liberty’ provided by neoliberal ideology (Hall and Winlow, 2015: 120). Thus, it behoves critical hate studies scholars to consider how and why hate manifests within these conditions. In order to do this, it is necessary to consider the impact of neoliberalism on human subjectivity and consequently how we think about other people within society as hateful subjects.
According to a transcendental materialist model of subjectivity (Johnston, 2008; Žižek, 2006), the self is realized via interaction within the social world and is indeed reliant on that environment for its formation, as per Perry’s (2001) analysis. However, the distinction here is the use of Lacan’s (1977) work in identifying the infinitely malleable nature of the human psyche that requires an ordering mechanism to make sense of the world. Lacan’s approach to the development of subjectivity identifies the human psyche as in search of a symbolic order that can direct and provide capacity for the complex range of emotions and drives that manifest in the neurological system; Lacan therefore suggests that the natural drives and desires of the human subject require channelling. Within a neoliberal environment, that channelling symbolic order is weak as neoliberal capitalism relies on a flexible human condition wherein natural drives and desires are channelled into the market, rather than any sense of collectivity as might manifest in culture and thus create boundaries to capital accumulation (Winlow and Hall, 2016). The human subject then is left wanting, lost within a quagmire of neurological triggers and ontological insecurity (Hall, 2012) that are pacified only by collectivity that is oriented around individualized, competitive identities, rather than notions of community and/or culture (Hall and Winlow, 2015).
Having established that neoliberalism creates the conditions within which we live, and our subjective identity is formed via interaction within the conditions of neoliberalism, we can understand and explain why hate manifests in multiple aspects of social life. Extreme acts of bias-motivated offending are explained as individuals in search of an ordering mechanism in their lives embrace religious dogma, ideological systems based on hierarchical notions of race, gender, sexuality and/or other defined ideologies. Everyday acts of bias-motivated violence are explained as without any effective symbolic order individuals experience a sense of ‘objectless anxiety’ wherein competition and individualism means that ‘everyone is automatically a potential real threat to anyone else’s livelihood, status and identity’ (Hall and Winlow, 2015: 114; see also Hall et al., 2008).
Critical hate studies then provides a theoretical backdrop to understand why hate harms happen as identified here. Furthermore, it goes on to suggest that in order to appreciate the lived experience of hate victimization within neoliberalism it is necessary to use a framework that incorporates all the harms of hate that are subjective, systemic and symbolic (Žižek, 2008). In order to do this critical hate studies utilizes the theory of recognition as developed by Yar (2012) using Honneth (1996) that sets out the necessity for humans to be respected, esteemed and loved in their lives in order to flourish. Although critiques of theories of recognition pose relevant and useful questions (Fraser, 2001; Toniolatti, 2015), the purpose of the theory here is to provide one way of unpacking the harms of hate within neoliberalism that acknowledge the development of human subjectivity. Recognition of the human need to flourish facilitates appreciation of the harms caused by its negation. Critical race theory identifies the symbolic violence of negating human experiences, be that within for example, policy discourse, legislation or historical narrative (Bell, 1980). The critical hate studies perspective argues that negation of recognition occurs throughout society, but is particularly felt within the precariat wherein marginalized people exist at the bottom of social hierarchies (Standing, 2014). As noted above, some Gypsies and Travellers are not ethnic groups; Gypsies’ and Travellers’ lived experience of hate exemplifies the limitations of critical race theory in this regard. To suggest that ethnicity does not determine all Gypsy and Traveller identities does not, in turn, intend to negate the rich, varied and strong ethnic experiences of the majority of Gypsies and Travellers. Indeed, to do so would be to fail to recognize the history of suffering that Gypsies and Travellers have experienced as a result of racism, not least the Pořajmos7 (Huttenbach, 1991). Rather, the point here is to provide an inclusive approach that recognizes all Gypsies’ and Travellers’ experiences of hate in the contemporary era, including, but not limited to, their experiences of racism.
The harms of hate
The theory of recognition (Yar, 2012) provides a useful framework to illustrate the harms of hate. In the first instance, it is necessary to consider the denial of recognition of the need for respect for Gypsies and Travellers. Lobbying by academics, policy makers, civil society and practitioners has meant that, of all the realms of recognition, there has been most recognition of Gypsies’ and Travellers’ needs in this area. As noted above, policy and legislation on both race hate behaviours and racially aggravated offending have recognized many Gypsies and Travellers as victims. Indeed, the acknowledgement of Gypsies and Travellers as marginalized communities has imbued contemporary reports and policy documents as noted above (and see, for example, Cemlyn et al., 2009; Lammy, 2017). The implementation of policies for Gypsy and Traveller inclusion has been slower in materializing, however (James and Smith, 2017), similar to the slow implementation of hate crime legislation generally (Mason, 2015). At the same time, the criminalization of Gypsies and Travellers continues unabated, as evidenced in the failure of local authorities to provide accommodation to Gypsies and Travellers at the same time as the Home Office announcement of proposed new powers for police to ‘crack down on illegal traveller sites’ (sic) (Home Office, 2019). While these new powers are couched within the language of accommodation provision, historically similar intentions have not been realized (Taylor, 2014). Hence, we see in practice the paradox for Gypsies and Travellers in England and Wales, wherein their needs are recognized via multiple policy and legislative mechanisms while also negated within that same arena via criminalization of their cultural nomadism. In addition, as noted above, the complexity of and inherent contradictions within definitions of Gypsy and Traveller identities in policy and legislation means that all Gypsies and Travellers are vulnerable in this context.
It is apparent from the above that two key issues arise. First, there has been a failure by policy makers to appreciate the multiplicity of Gypsy and Traveller cultures and communities in the UK and hence there is a lack of ‘joined up’ thinking regarding provision of statute. Second, essentialized notions of race and mobility have informed those statutes and thus exacerbated those misunderstandings. It has been argued elsewhere that the application of a ‘sedentarist binary’ (James and Southern, 2019: 324) definition of nomadism within contemporary policy has failed to appreciate the cultural nomadism of Gypsies and Travellers, but rather has reduced their cultures8 to their mobility. Gypsies and Travellers are racialized and experience racism in their everyday lives (Clark, 2006). However, to reduce Gypsy and Traveller identities to race and/or ethnicity, not only excludes significant populations, but also serves to augment essentialist perceptions of Gypsies and Travellers as the mythical Romany (Holloway, 2005) that excludes other ethnic groups of Gypsy and Traveller.
Here, it is important to note the way in which neoliberalism ‘has assembled its projects and interests from the field of issues saturated with race, with gender, with sex, with religion, with ethnicity and nationality’ (Duggan, 2012: xvi; see also Brown, 2015). Thus, the racialized mechanisms used to project hate on to Gypsies and Travellers, such as racist speech and language, exclusion from premises and criminalization, reflect those experienced by other minority communities (see Goldberg and Solomos, 2002). Respondents to the hate crime project referred to their experiences of racism in a number of ways: I don’t think they would have taken me to court if I wasn’t a gypsy girl.(Res 2.7)Been called a pikey.(Res 3.9)I am victimised because racism is tolerated.(Res 4.29)Gippo.(Res 2.1)
In addition, references to Gypsies and Travellers as analogous with ‘dirt’ (Sibley, 1988) were also evident in the research: Rubbish thrown at property.(Res 4.6)Called mud people.(Res 1.4)Bars of soap left [outside trailer].(Res 3.2)
Gypsies and Travellers interviewed were pertinently aware of the lack of respect given to them by those in authority. For example, respondents stated: We don’t matter to the authorities.(Res 4.3)When I deal with any kind of office, they reject me/turn me down.(Res 3.7)The government still seem to think its OK to treat me as a 3rd class citizen. . . I think they would love to complete their ‘ethnic cleansing’ plans.(Res 4.7, quotation marks in original)
It was unsurprising therefore, that the Gypsies and Travellers in the research had only reported 28% of the hate crimes they said they had experienced, compared to a national average of 51% for hate crime generally (Flately, 2018). Interestingly, those reports that had been made were to the police, rather than to third parties as might have been expected. The provision of 24 hour, third party reporting centres has served as a central plank of the hate crime agenda in the post-Macpherson era that acknowledged marginalized communities’ lack of confidence in police services (Macpherson, 1999). However, none of the Gypsies and Travellers in this research had reported any incidents or crimes to a third party, potentially suggesting the lack of faith in authorities’ reaches beyond the police for Gypsies and Travellers as evidenced in this research, noted above, by some reticence to complete the hate crime survey. Research has previously shown that Gypsies and Travellers lack trust in authorities generally due to the multi-agency approach used to manage them historically as a problem community (James and Richardson, 2006). This may explain their unwillingness to engage with third party reporting mechanisms. A hate crime reporting mechanism specifically for Gypsies and Travellers has been set up since the completion of this research study that has seen some significant reporting over the last two years (Thompson and Woodger, 2018).
Despite their occasional willingness to report hate incidents and crimes to the police, Gypsies and Travellers generally lacked confidence in the police, similar to other marginalized communities (Phillips and Bowling, 2017). Interactions with police constituted negative encounters as described by the Gypsies and Travellers in the research: Told by a policeman that people like us should be put against a wall and shot as there was no place for people like us in society.(Res 4.5)I suffered post-traumatic stress after an incident where the police raided a site I was living peacefully on. . .. The use of force to innocent people and children was shocking.(Res 3.3)
Overall then, the recognition of Gypsies’ and Travellers’ needs within policy and legislation evidences a positive step forward in delivering respect to those communities. However, a failure to embed a comprehensive appreciation of the variety of Gypsy and Traveller ethnicities and cultures has meant that their experiences overall are not recognized and they thus experience social harms that are systemic as policing authorities practise badly and lack legitimacy for Gypsies and Travellers. The hate crime agenda has a symbolic function to challenge prejudice through legislative means (Mason, 2013), but it fails in this regard by being exclusive in protecting some groups more than others and subsequently augmenting the hierarchy of deserving victims (Chakraborti and Garland, 2012). As such, the current hate crime agenda actually produces a symbolic social harm as Gypsies and Travellers are either placed at the bottom of the hierarchy of provision or are left out of its protective mechanisms.
Mason (2013) argues that hate crime legislation is reliant on victim communities’ capacity to elicit some form of compassion from wider society for its symbolic function to be realized. Given the extensive and historic racism faced by many Gypsies and Travellers, their ability to stimulate concern from the wider social world is highly unlikely in the first instance (Pew Research Center, 2014). Further, the contemporary neoliberal milieu of competitive individualism facilitates detachment, rather than empathy. Gypsies and Travellers then, exist within the precariat, wherein they must fight for access to resources among numerous other socially excluded (and disliked) people who are likewise trying to ascend the ladder of status hierarchy. The competition between Gypsies and Travellers and other minority communities was evident within the hate research project, as one respondent encapsulates here: ‘[There was] a petition in a shop nearby transit site. Racist in my view but, apparently not in the eyes of the police. I’m sure if it had been against Black/Asian minorities action would have been taken’ (Res 2.3).
In addition, competition between Gypsy and Traveller communities has previously been noted in research (Bhopal and Myers, 2008), with specific references to the problematization of New Travellers as illegitimate, despite having lived culturally nomadic lifestyles for generations (Clark, 1997). Beyond this, other Gypsies and Travellers have also competed for status within the hierarchies of provision and legitimacy. Greenfields (2006: 55) says, when there is significant pressure over sites, land usage and the level of discrimination and bad publicity that Travellers commonly experience, it is human nature that individuals will have a tendency to express the opinion that ‘it’s not Travellers like X, its Travellers of Y ethnicity who behave in this manner’. Accordingly a perceived hierarchy of ‘acceptable Travelling communities’ may be said to exist in the minds of the media, the public and, to some extent, of Gypsies and Travellers themselves.
The ‘human nature’ Greenfields refers to here, I would argue, relates to the subjective identity developed within the competitive and individualized norms of neoliberal capitalism. Indeed, the lack of site provision for Gypsies and Travellers, augmented by the closure of their traditional stopping places since the 1960s (Taylor, 2014), has meant that competition for spaces to stop and stay on has proliferated and been amplified by the cultural nomadism of New Travellers. Subsequent stigmatization of Gypsies and Travellers, alongside existing racism, has manifested within media and public perceptions, as well as within Gypsy and Traveller cultures themselves. Within this research, some Gypsies and Travellers referred to internal tensions between cultures: The problems I have had is from people on site. Prejudice from people on site.(Res 4.1)They want me off the site.(Res 2.42)
The lack of solidarity between people and communities that status hierarchies create (as noted by Hall et al., 1978), results in a failure of recognition of the human need for esteem. With no effective symbolic order for humans to acknowledge each other within, that is respectful of their similarities and differences, the capacity for human flourishing is diminished. This research evidenced the low esteem that Gypsies and Travellers are held in by wider society. The 79 people who completed the survey reported a total of 225 hate incidents or crimes committed against them on the basis of their identity as a Gypsy or Traveller. Bias-motivated incidents they experienced included hate speech through name calling (81% of respondents), general bullying (71% of respondents) and serious threats and intimidation (29% of respondents), including sexualized intimidation, harassment and unwanted photography and filming. Bias-motivated crimes they experienced included minor damage to property (30% of respondents), serious damage to property (20% of respondents), minor physical assault (20% of respondents) and serious physical assault (15% of respondents). Other offences experienced were, burglary, theft, stone throwing, brick throwing, being shot at and arson (overall 19% of respondents).
One interview from the research reveals Gypsies’ and Travellers’ lived experience of fear and insecurity, the difficulty to find a space to stop and stay on and their inability to rely on others for help or support: In the past Sandra* has experienced extensive bullying and abuse due to being a Traveller. She has been banned from launderettes, pubs and shops and her living vehicles have been subject to criminal damage. Most recently, she was invited to occupy a particular place by a landowner, which appeared an opportunity to provide space for herself and other Travellers to settle for a period. She had not been to the locality before and there were no available legitimate stopping sites in the vicinity. She felt that this invitation to occupy farmland equated to a safe place to stop. One afternoon, not long after their arrival, around 30 local farmers, armed with shotguns, turned up at the site telling the Travellers to move on and threatening that if they had not left by the end of the day, they would return at night. Given that the Travellers felt they had been given the right to stay on the land by the landowner, that it was a group of four families with a total of nine young children aged 5 to 9, and they were unfamiliar with anywhere else to go, the Travellers stayed on the site. The threat of the farmers returning meant that the Travellers were fearful for their children. These fears were made worse by their previous negative experiences of ill-treatment by gorgers (non-Gypsies). The Travellers were so fearful that they arranged escape routes from the site and hiding places for the children in case the farmers should return. This involved placing sheepskin rugs over barbed wire fences and placing duvets, torches and food in secluded hiding spots nearby.(Int notes S, *pseudonym)
In this circumstance, it transpired that the landowner had an ulterior motive for the Travellers’ occupation of his land, as he was using their presence to place pressure on the local authority to agree a previously refused planning application for a building on his land. Not only then are Gypsies and Travellers perceived as problematic within communities, they are also in this instance considered to serve a purpose as a consequence of the lack of esteem held for them by sedentary communities and authorities alike. Suggestions that this simply represents a clash between nomadism and sedentarism (Levinson and Sparkes, 2004) would be to reduce appreciations of nomadism to mobility, and would negate the fact that mobility has been largely embraced in contemporary society, when it has served the interests of profit (James and Channing, 2019). Indeed, the caravanning industry, that serves the seasonal use of caravans and parks for people to holiday, has burgeoned in the late 20th century and caravan sites for holidaymakers cover the countryside where this research was completed.
The extensive subjective, systemic and symbolic harms detailed above place Gypsies and Travellers in fear of their and their families’ safety. The insecurity of everyday life in contemporary neoliberal society manifests acutely within, and is exacerbated by, the precarity of Gypsies’ and Travellers’ lived experience. Within such circumstances it is unsurprising that Gypsies and Travellers commonly hide their identity from those in authority and others outside of their community (James, 2007). In doing so, however, they risk further harms to themselves and the primary interpersonal relationships they have. Recognition of the human need for love is essential for human beings to thrive and thus its negation is highly problematic. Within the hate research project, a number of parents noted the trouble caused to their children when they identified them as from Gypsy and Traveller homes: School said they had a vacancy for our youngest daughter until I said where we lived and was then told they made a mistake and didn’t have any vacancies.(Res 2.8)I did take my daughter out of Year 7 because of bullying related to her living in vehicles.(Res 3.7)
The failure to recognize a loved one’s identity is to negate their cultural inheritance and their sense of self, causing harm to them as they develop their subjectivity in relation to those that care for them most. This symbolic harm is augmented by wider society’s exclusion of Gypsies and Travellers and essentialism of their cultures, as noted above. Powell (2008) suggests that Gypsies and Travellers utilize their limited agency through tactically circumventing social controls placed on them. Indeed, within this research, some participants evidenced their resilience to hateful behaviours through averting their impact: [I don’t report] because I don’t identify as a victim.(Res 4.53)[Victimization is] just general assumptions based on stereotypes, easily turned around via the provision of info in response to ignorance, always a positive game changer .(Res 5.6)
This is not to suggest that Gypsies and Travellers are not subject to social forces, but rather that they retain their cultural integrity through tactics of aversion that have resulted in resilience, similar to participants in research by Williams and Tregidga (2014). This means that Gypsies and Travellers live separately from wider society of their own volition, as well as as a consequence of their exclusion. While their laudable attempts to resist the oppression of others means that they can occasionally exist beyond the reach of control agencies, this also means that they can exist beyond the reach of other, supportive agencies. Further, it results in the amplification of the cultural essentialism imposed upon them. This means that effective resolution of domestic and community problems is not facilitated, as Gypsies and Travellers lack confidence to report such matters and support agencies are fearful to broach them. Apart from progressive work carried out by civil society organizations, there is barely any research on domestic violence, homophobia, transphobia or inter-community anti-Gypsyism within Gypsy and Traveller communities. Given the rates of such issues in wider society, it behoves us to consider how to breach this gap to ensure that Gypsies and Travellers attain recognition of their need for love.
Conclusion
This article has identified the breadth of hate harms Gypsies and Travellers experience within contemporary neoliberal capitalism. By using a critical hate studies approach, it has been possible to provide an inclusive analysis that recognizes the lived experience of hate for all Gypsies and Travellers. The article has therefore set out how critically informed scholarship on hate can inform knowledge in two ways. First, it can facilitate criminology to move beyond existing debates in studies of race and ethnicity via the inclusion of Gypsies and Travellers within discussion where they have previously been negated (see, for example, Spalek, 2008). Second, it enables criminological engagement with the wider social sciences, specifically psychology and sociology, to examine the impact of neoliberal capitalism on human relations generally, while ensuring acknowledgement of the nuanced experiences of minority communities. Notwithstanding existing research on microaggressions (see, for example, Hughey et al., 2017; Sue, 2010), a key area of concern within hate studies has been the apparent inability of critical theory to explain the everyday nature of hate, as well as extreme hate behaviours committed against multiple communities. Scholarship in this area has vacillated around the concept of hate itself, whom to protect within policy and legislation, and how to challenge increased levels of hatefulness in contemporary society. This article proposes a rehabilitation of the notion of hate through the lens of social harm. It has been evidenced here that Gypsies and Travellers experience hostility towards them on the basis of their identity and thus, the necessity to examine and theorize hate is important and relevant, as is the development and implementation of statute to challenge hateful behaviours. Indeed, some protections against race hate are in place, however existing protective frameworks simply serve as silos that can be breached but commonly are not, due to a lack of solidarity between and within marginalized communities and wider society. While the capacity of this article does not allow a full consideration of policy development, and further research is required, it is worth noting the need for more than piecemeal policy and legislative changes that only have the capacity to address specific hateful behaviours (Brown, 2015). A critical hate studies perspective suggests that hate studies could expedite a comprehensive and effective approach to positive praxis through recognition of the human need to flourish. In doing so, a positive discourse would develop that focused on what should, rather than should not, be experienced (Hall and Winlow, 2015). It would then be possible to create a policy and practice environment that effectively acknowledges that race matters, but which also acknowledges the intersectional nature of our identities and the harmful subjectivities engendered within contemporary neoliberal society.

Considerdonating[1]today to support our mission. J oe Biden will become the first Syracuse University alumnus to serve as president of the United States. The former vice president defeated President Donald Trump after obtaining at least 273electoral votes with victories in battlegroundstates, including Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. 
Biden graduated from SU's College of Law in 1968 and has maintained connections[2] with the university throughout his political career. His running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-California) will be the first woman and the first person of color to serve as vice president. Biden's victory came four daysafter Election Day, as the country waited for several keystates to count a massivevolume of mail-in ballots. Almost 60 million voters opted to vote by mail in this election after states expanded mail-in and early voting options due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Associated Press, CNN and NBC News have projected Biden as the winner of the 2020 election after he secured a lead in Pennsylvania, winning the state's 20 electoral votes. Arizona, Nevada and Georgia remain too close to call, but Biden currently holds a lead in those states. The former vice president won despite the Trump campaignfiling longshot lawsuits in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia to dispute, without any evidence, the legitimacy of the ballot-counting process. Since Election Day, Trump and his campaign pushed a false narrative claiming that Democrats were 'stealing' the election — haphazardly calling forvote counts to continuein some states and to stop in others. Biden served as a Delaware senator for 36 years before he was elected in 2008 to serve as the 44th vice president alongside former President Barack Obama. He served another term as vice president to Obama in 2012.Throughout the race, Biden has based his campaign around a promise to 'build back better,' which includes restoring the economy following the coronavirus pandemic and healing political division in the country. His victory comes as COVID-19 has killed over 235,000 Americans and after protestersacross the country swept the streets this summer in the wake of thekilling of George Floyd in May. Trump has faced criticism over his response to the coronavirus, but Biden plans to expand rapid COVID-19 testing across the country and implement a national mask mandate. Biden also pledged toprovide 'clear guidance' for how schools and businesses should operate during the pandemic and a plan for an equitable distribution of vaccines. While Biden has firmly rejected calls to defund police departments, he plans to spend an additional $300 million a year on community policing initiatives and other reforms. He would also seek to decriminalize recreational marijuana but would not attempt nationwide legalization. Republicans are likely to hold on to the Senate and Democrats to the House.Biden will inherit a divided Congress, further challenging his ability to transform campaign promises into legislative actionas the country fails to overcomethe pandemic. Joe Biden visited SU in 2015 as part of his speaking tour for 'It's On Us,' a campaign to prevent sexual assault on college campuses. Daily Orange File PhotoFollowing his graduation from SU, the president-elect made several visits to the university and delivered three commencement addresses. He was the commencement speaker for the College of Law in 2006 and the keynote speaker during SU's 2009 commencement ceremony. During his second address, which came a little over a year into his term as vice president, he reflected on his experiences at SU and how they contributed to his political career. 'Since I've been in public life, there has never been a graduating class that is graduating into a moment where they actually have a chance to make more than incremental change,' Biden said in the speech. 'That's why Barack and I ran. That's why I believe so passionately we have a shot like hasn't occurred in the lifetime of anyone in this Dome. And now we're here. Imagine what we can do.' Biden visited campus again in 2015, towardthe end of his second term as vice president. During the visit, Biden spoke about preventing sexual assault and domestic violence on college campuses as part of the 'It's On Us' campaign. Biden and Obama created the campaign in 2014. The president-elect made his most recent visit to SU in 2016, when he delivered another commencement address[3] to the College of Law. During this speech, he spoke about his son Beau Biden, who died of brain cancer in May 2015. Beau Biden graduated from SU's College of Law in 1994 and delivered the college's commencement address in 2011. In November 2019, Biden said he was 'deeply disturbed'[4] by a series of racist incidents that occurred on and near campus last fall. Biden's first presidentialcampaigncollapsedin 1987 after he admitted to plagiarism, including a law review article for an essay in his first year of law school at SU.The president-elect told The New York Times in 1987 that while he made a mistake by plagiarizing, he had just misunderstood the assignment's citing requirements. Shortly after the scandal, Biden dropped out of the presidential race. Joe Biden spoke at the 2016 commencement for SU's College of Law, where both he and his late son Beau Biden earned law degrees. Daily Orange File PhotoBiden also dated and married his first wife, Neilia Hunter, during his time at SU. They lived together about three miles from SU's campus before moving to Delaware after Biden graduated. Neilia died in a car crash in 1972 that also killed the couple's infant daughter, Naomi Biden, and severely injured his two sons, Hunter and Beau Biden. During his first commencement speech at SU, Biden discussed how his life experiences taught him how to handle adversity. His victory represents a shift from Trump on many key issues, including climate change, immigration and health care. The president-elect plans to support an active federal role in reducing greenhouse gases and has introduced a $2 trillion plan to fight climate change by eliminating carbon emissions from the electric sector by 2035. Trump, however, has dismissed the science behind climate change and withdrew the country from the Paris agreement among the United Nations, which aims to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees. Biden has said he will rejoin the agreement and urge other nations to increase their commitments to the climate. Trump and Biden also significantly diverge on immigration. While Trump had built nearly 321 miles of barriers on the U.S.-Mexico border as of September, Biden has said he would immediately stop the construction of the border wall and focus his immigration policy on improving screening systems across the border. The former vice president has also said he would work to raise the limit of refugees allowed in the country. Trump limited the number to 15,000 in October, the lowest it has ever been. Biden supports the Affordable Care Act, a comprehensive health care reform law passed while Biden was serving as vice president under Obama. Trump has opposed the ACA but has yet to produce an alternative plan. The president-elect has also endorsed Dana Balter, the Democratic candidate for New York's 24th Congressional District and a former professor in SU's Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs.

BATON ROUGE, La. — A Louisiana lawmaker’s effort to eliminate police officers’ wide immunity from civil lawsuits for damages for injury or death was shelved by Republicans on a state House committee.
The House civil law committee voted 9-7 Wednesday against the measure from Democratic Rep. Edmond Jordan.
More than a dozen black lawmakers stood together in the room to support Jordan’s bill. After the vote, some left in tears.
Supporters of the bill said the immunity is so sweeping that it’s nearly impossible to hold officers accountable for excessive force when prosecutors refuse to bring criminal charges.
Opponents said legal avenues exist to prosecute police for excessive force. The Louisiana Sheriffs’ Association said the measure would make it harder for officers to combat crime.
The vote fell largely along party lines. Two GOP lawmakers joined Democrats in backing the measure, which was proposed after the death last month of George Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody and other recent instances of police brutality.
___
PORTLAND, Ore. — City commissioners voted Wednesday to cut $16 million from the Portland Police Bureau’s budget in response to concerns about police brutality and racial injustice.
The cuts are part of a city budget approved by the commissioners in a 3-1 vote. The money saved by eliminating the gun reduction violence team, school resource officers and transit officers will be redirected to social service programs. The lone commissioner to vote no said the cuts to police weren’t deep enough.
Thousands of protesters have filled the streets of Portland every night for three weeks following the death last month of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes.
___
ATLANTA — The police officer who fatally shot Rayshard Brooks in the back after the fleeing man pointed a stun gun in his direction is going to be charged with felony murder and 10 other crimes.
Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard made the announcement about Garrett Rolfe during a news conference Wednesday.
Howard said Rolfe kicked Brooks while he lay on the ground and that the officer with him, Devin Brosnan, stood on Brooks’ shoulder as he struggled for life Friday night.
Rolfe had already been fired after he fatally shot the 27-year-old Brooks. Brosnan had been put on administrative leave.
Brosnan is being charged with aggravated assault and other crimes. The shooting had sparked new demonstrations in Georgia’s capital against police brutality.
___
 BOSTON — Police officers in Massachusetts would have to be certified by the state under a bill filed Wednesday by Gov. Charlie Baker.
The bill would also allow for the decertification of officers who engage in excessive force, and it encourages additional training, including for advanced deescalation techniques.
Massachusetts is one of only a few states without a statewide certification program for law enforcement.
The Republican governor said his administration worked with members of the Massachusetts Black and Latino Legislative Caucus and public safety officials to draft the bill.
Baker said at a press conference that the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis at the hands of police officers made it clear it's ""the time to get this done.” He added that improving law enforcement is only one piece of the process.

LONDON — The governing body of Oxford University’s Oriel College has recommended the removal of a statue of Victorian imperialist Cecil Rhodes that has long been the target of protests.
The college’s governors, made up of faculty, met Wednesday and said they had “voted to launch an independent Commission of Inquiry into the key issues surrounding the Rhodes statue.“
A similar campaign has sought the removal of his statue in Oxford. The movement has gained new momentum since the death of George Floyd spurred anti-racism protests around the world.
Rhodes made a fortune from gold and diamond mines in the late 19th century, with miners laboring in brutal conditions. His statue was removed from the University of Cape Town in South Africa in 2015.
___
RICHMOND, Va. — A statue of African American tennis star Arthur Ashe has been vandalized.
Photos show the base of the monument tagged with white spray paint and the words “white lives matter” as well as the initials “WLM.” Those initials were later painted over with “BLM,” short for black lives matter.
Richmond Police said they were alerted to the vandalism on Monument Avenue about 10:15 a.m. Wednesday. Police say red paint on the statue itself was already being removed by community members.
Authorities have information on possible suspects and are asking the community to call the Crime Stoppers line if they have information on who was responsible for the vandalism.
The monument was dedicated in 1996 to memorialize the Richmond native, who died in 1993, and to counterbalance the string of statues on Memorial Avenue dedicated to Confederate leaders.
___
LAS VEGAS — The University of Nevada, Las Vegas has removed a statue of its “Hey Reb!” mascot from in front of its alumni center following an outcry from student groups, including the Native American Student Association.
The decision to remove the bronze statue, which was criticized for its relationship to the Confederacy, came weeks after the death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis.
University President Marta Meana says she has had conversations with individuals and stakeholders about how the university can move forward in light of recent events.
The statue is expected to be returned to its donors.
___
NEW YORK — New York’s governor signed an executive order recognizing Juneteenth as a paid holiday for state employees to commemorate the emancipation of slaves in the U.S.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo called it “a day we should all reflect upon” and “a day that is especially relevant in this moment in history. Cuomo said he’ll propose legislation next year making June 19 a permanent state holiday.
President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation was effective Jan. 1, 1863, but the news took time to travel. It wasn’t until June 19, 1865, when word of the proclamation was brought by the Union army to enslaved people in Texas.
___
AMSTERDAM — Vandals have daubed red paint and the word “racist” on a statue of Mohandas Gandhi in Amsterdam, amid a wave of attacks on statues around the world of controversial historical figures.
A worker cleaned the statue Wednesday with a high-pressure water hose. Gandhi, widely lauded for his peaceful campaign to win independence for India, has faced criticism for some of his writings about black Africans.
A lawyer, Gandhi traveled to South Africa in 1893 and stayed for two decades, fighting to expand rights for Indians there. He has faced criticism for referring in his writings to black South Africans as backward. However, he later changed his views and supported the rights of black South Africans.
His nonviolent resistance methods have been used in movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.
___
DETROIT — A white suburban Detroit police chief has been suspended for 30 days without pay and will undergo diversity training for inappropriate social media posts about people protesting the death of George Floyd.
Trustees in Macomb County’s Shelby Township voted 5-2 on Tuesday night on the punishment for chief Robert J. Shelide, who has held the title since 2015.
Shelide, who earlier apologized, told the township board before the vote that he is “not a racist” and “I bleed blue.”
Shelide had been on administrative leave the past two weeks while officials investigated posts on a now-deleted Twitter account. Screenshots posted on Facebook show one tweet spoke about the need to “unleash real cops” and describing protesters as “barbarians” and needing “body bags.“
___
PORTLAND, Ore. — Police say a man drove his car into a crowd of protesters early Wednesday in downtown Portland, injuring three people.
Police say the 27-year-old male driver drove away “at a high rate of speed,” but was tracked and arrested on suspicion of hit and run, reckless driving and possession of a controlled substance, according to The Oregonian/OregonLive.
Two people were taken by ambulance to a hospital. Another was taken for treatment in a personal car. Police say none of the injuries were life-threatening.
___
ATLANTA — Georgia’s lieutenant governor is proposing a version of a hate crimes law for the state.
Republican Geoff Duncan called on lawmakers to create a free-standing hate crime and include more categories of bias crimes. Those would involve people victimized because of their culture and their status in exercising First Amendment rights, including worship, free speech, free press, assembly or petition of government.
A previous effort was found unconstitutional by the state Supreme Court more than a decade ago.
In February, Ahmaud Arbery was shot near Brunswick, Georgia. Investigators have said a white man uttered a racial slur after chasing Arbery down and shooting him.
Georgia’s House passed a simpler measure last year that’s been stalled in a Senate committee for more than year. The bill would add extra penalties onto crimes committed because of someone’s race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, mental disability or physical disability.
___
GENEVA — The brother of George Floyd has made a heartfelt plea to the U.N.’s top human rights body to launch intense international scrutiny of systemic racism and the killing of unarmed blacks by police.
Philonese Floyd’s message by video to the Human Rights Council came as it contemplates an unprecedented bid sought by the Africa Group to create a Commission of Inquiry — the council’s most powerful tool of scrutiny — to examine and report on racism and violence against protesters by police in the United States.
“I am my brother’s keeper. You in the United Nations are your brothers and sisters’ keepers in America — and you have the power to help us get justice for my brother George Floyd,” Floyd said. “I am asking you to help him. I am asking you to help me. I am asking you to help us: Black people in America.”
___
HUNTINGTON, W.Va. — The Huntington City Council in West Virginia will vote Wednesday on a proposal to make Juneteenth a permanent city holiday.
The celebration commemorates when enslaved people in Texas learned they were free on June 19, 1865. Huntington Mayor Steve Williams told The Herald-Dispatch he supports the proposal and wants the city’s African American residents to know “the city celebrates Juneteenth with them just as we all celebrate July Fourth together.”
The mayor says the idea for the holiday proposal came from meetings with his diversity advisory committee amid the international protests following the death of George Floyd. Williams expects Wednesday’s meeting will help fast-track the resolution so council members can get it in the books before Friday.
The Emancipation Proclamation was signed by President Abraham Lincoln on Jan. 1, 1863, and freed enslaved people of the rebellion Confederate states.
___
HOUSTON — Officials say a statue of a Confederate soldier has been removed from a downtown Houston park and a second Confederate statue is expected to be removed soon.
The “Spirit of the Confederacy” statue was removed late Tuesday from Sam Houston Park. Mayor Sylvester Turner said last week the statue will be housed in the Houston Museum of African American Culture.
A second statue, of Confederate artillery commander Richard W. “Dick” Dowling, is also slated for removal. Initially, the Dowling statue was to be moved from Houston’s Hermann Park to the Sabine Pass Battleground State Historical Site near Port Arthur.
But officials say the Dowling statue will instead be placed in a warehouse, at least temporarily, after leaders in Port Arthur expressed opposition.
___
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — A Roman Catholic chaplain at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has resigned at the request of the archdiocese after sending an email suggesting the killing of George Floyd was not an act of racism and he hadn’t lived “a virtuous life.”
The Archdiocese of Boston asked the Rev. Daniel Patrick Moloney to step down June 9 after he sent the message to Catholics at MIT, The Boston Globe reports. A statement from the archdiocese said Moloney’s comments “were wrong and by his resignation he accepts the hurt they have caused.”
The archdiocese learned about the email from Catholics at MIT and alumni. Moloney says he was trying to speak out against “cancel culture” and regrets his message has been misunderstood.
Suzy Nelson, an MIT vice president and dean for student life, sent an email to students calling Moloney’s comments “deeply disturbing” and “Father Moloney’s message failed to acknowledge the dignity of each human being and the devastating impact of systemic racism.”

GENEVA – A U.S. ambassador says the United States is committed to addressing its “shortcomings,” ahead of the U.N. human rights body's discussion of systemic racism and police brutality.
Andrew Bremberg, the U.S. ambassador in Geneva, noted President Donald Trump has condemned the actions of Minneapolis police officers involved in the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man. Trump signed an executive order on police reform on Tuesday.
“The United States recognizes and is committed to addressing its shortcomings, including racial discrimination, and injustices that stem from such discrimination, that persist in our society,” Bremberg said in a statement. “Every democracy faces challenges — the difference is how we deal with them.”
Bremberg says the executive order was “an example of how transparent and responsive our government leaders are in holding violators accountable for their actions and reforming our own system.”
The Human Rights Council in Geneva, following a call by African nations, will discuss “racially inspired human rights violations, systematic racism, police brutality and the violence against peaceful protests.”

NEW ORLEANS — The whereabouts of a statue of a slave owner toppled by protesters in New Orleans and thrown into the Mississippi River remain unknown after a group of men fished the bust out of the water.
A video shows the group using ropes and a plank to carry the paint-splattered bust of John McDonogh out of the river and onto a pickup truck Sunday.
Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s office told The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate the bust is “considered stolen property,” and whoever has it should contact the city regarding its return.
McDonogh left much of his money to New Orleans and Baltimore for schools, and many schools in New Orleans are named after him.
On McDonogh Day each year, schoolchildren from across the city lined up to lay flowers in a racially segregated ceremony. It was boycotted in the 1950s when African-American children would have to wait for hours for white children to lay their flowers first.

RICHMOND, Va. — Demonstrators in Richmond tore down another Confederate statue on Tuesday night.
The Howitzers Monument located near Virginia Commonwealth University’s Monroe Park campus was toppled after protesters spent the night marching in the rain and used a rope to pull it down from its pedestal.
A video from the Richmond Times-Dispatch shows the paint-splattered statue on the ground as the rain continued overnight in Virginia’s capital city.
It’s the third Confederate statue, and the fourth monument, to be torn down in Virginia since international protests erupted following the death of George Floyd by a white Minneapolis police officer who pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck.
Statues of Confederate president Jefferson Davis, Confederate Gen. Williams Carter Wickham as well as Christopher Columbus were toppled.
The protesters in Richmond started their march Tuesday night advocating for the removal of all Confederate statues, establishing a civilian policing review board and defunding the police, among other things.
The Howitzers Monument, showed a Confederate artilleryman standing in front of a gun, was erected in 1892 to memorialize the city’s Civil War artillery unit, according to the Encyclopedia of Virginia.

PORTLAND, Ore. — At least two Portland-based reporters have been hurt in recent days while covering protests against police brutality.
Oregon Public Broadcasting reports Oregonian journalist Beth Nakamura recounted being slammed by a baton. Portland Tribune reporter Zane Sparling said he was shoved into a wall by a police officer and hit by a crowd control munition.
The reporters say they identified themselves to police as press. In both incidents, the reporters were told by police, in what the journalists described as profanity-laced responses, that their press credentials did not matter.
Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler said on Twitter they were alarming incidents that need to be addressed.
Police spokesperson Lt. Tina Jones says they continue to work with media partners about the importance of following lawful orders so they can stay safe and avoid arrest or altercation.
However, members of the media have a fundamental right to do their jobs during demonstrations.

MINNEAPOLIS — A Minnesota board that licenses and set training standards for all peace officers in the state plans to review the death of George Floyd.
The Minnesota Board of Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) is required to review all misconduct complaints against licensed police officers. If the complaint is ruled justified, the board can revoke any officer’s license, the Star Tribune reported.
All four Minneapolis police officers who have been charged in the May 25 death of Floyd were fired from the department, but they are still licensed Minnesota peace officers.
The POST Board has asked the court for copies of the criminal complaints against former officer Derek Chauvin, who is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, as well as former officers Tou Thao, Thomas Lane and J. Kueng, who are all charged with aiding and abetting. A witness video captured Chauvin, who is white, pressing his knee against Floyd’s neck before the handcuffed black man died in Minneapolis.
In a statement, the board said Chauvin’s actions do not reflect any training that officers receive.
“The video is troubling and disturbing and it is the Board’s position that sanctity of life must be the guiding principle for all law enforcement officers,” the statement said.

BROOKLYN CENTER, Minn. — FBI Director Christopher Wray visited the bureau's Minneapolis field office on Tuesday to check in on employees and get briefed on the federal civil rights investigation into the officers involved in the death of George Floyd.
Minneapolis FBI spokesman Kevin Smith said Wray came to the local office on Tuesday morning for a quick “welfare check” on employees who have been working on the civil rights investigation, as well as investigations into violent protests and civil unrest. Smith said Wray offered his support and acknowledged the office’s hard work.
Smith said Wray also got a thorough briefing on the civil rights investigation, and underscored that investigators need to move swiftly but correctly as they determine whether to charge former Minneapolis police officers Derek Chauvin, J. Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao with violating Floyd’s civil rights.
Floyd, a black man who was handcuffed, died May 25 after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck, even after Floyd said he couldn’t breathe and stopped moving.
Chauvin has been charged in state court with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. The other three men are charged with aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and manslaughter. All four officers were fired.
The federal investigation is ongoing.

ECOSOC Advisor Gayton Issues Remarks at 3rd Committee Interactive Dialogue on Protection Against Violence,False,"The U.S. Mission to the United Nations issued the following remarks by Marilyn Gayton, U.N. Economic and Social Council advisor, at a third committee interactive dialogue on protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity:
Independent Expert Madrigal. Let me begin with a question: What strategies can countries implement to improve data collection on violence directed against LGBTI persons without doing harm?
We appreciate this opportunity to highlight the continued need to combat violence and discrimination against LGBTI persons globally. Protecting and defending the human rights of all people has long been and remains at the heart of American foreign policy. The United States proudly advances efforts to protect LGBTI populations from violence, criminalization, discrimination, and stigma.
Around the world, LGBTI persons are subjected to violence and bias-motivated crime. The United States stands against all forms of violence, including human rights violations and abuses against people on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity. All governments should uphold their commitment to protect and respect every person's fundamental freedoms, and no government should support or encourage violence or hostility directed at LGBTI persons under any circumstances.
Continued barriers to accurate reporting of violence, harassment, and discrimination-- something exacerbated by laws criminalizing LGBTI status or conduct-- is deeply concerning. The negative impact of such laws can be heightened by COVID-19 pandemic-related emergency restrictions on certain fundamental freedoms. LGBTI persons have reported increased human rights abuses and restrictions on their freedom of association and their right to peaceful assembly during this time.
Comprehensive and accurate data collection is essential to formulating policy and to holding officials and others accountable for behavior inconsistent with the equal rights of LGBTI persons. We are concerned that such data remains lacking both in many national contexts and in some UN reporting. Especially in light of current global challenges that increase the vulnerability of LGBTI persons to violence and discrimination, the United States will continue to mobilize resources to protect the human rights of LGBTI persons. Better data will further this effort.

After Ahmaud Arbery was chased down and killed while he was jogging in Glynn County, Ga., investigators say, one of the white men accused of shooting him used a racial slur. In the above video, Wanda Cooper-Jones, Mr. Arbery’s mother, demands that these men be prosecuted not just on charges of killing her son but also for targeting him because of his skin color. Yet as it now stands, that can’t happen: Georgia is one of just four states in the country without a hate crime law.
Georgia lawmakers can change this. They’re going back into session next Monday, giving them the opportunity to decide whether to bring a hate crime bill up for a vote.
If we can’t stop these hate-inspired attacks, we can at least prosecute them for what they are.

MINNEAPOLIS — Minnesota prosecutors acknowledged Wednesday that a police officer had his knee on George Floyd’s neck for 7 minutes, 46 seconds — not the 8:46 that has become a global symbol of police brutality.
The initial complaint alleges Derek Chauvin “had his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds in total. Two minutes and 53 seconds of this was after Mr. Floyd was non-responsive.” But timestamps cited in the document’s description of the incident, much of which was caught on video, showed Chauvin had his knee on Floyd for 7 minutes, 46 seconds, including 1 minute, 53 seconds after Floyd appeared to stop breathing.
Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman’s office said in a statement that “these kinds of technical matters” can be handled in a future amendment to the criminal case if it becomes necessary.
The Associated Press began asking about the error the day after the initial charges were filed, but prosecutors had repeatedly declined to address it as their 8 minutes and 46 seconds began to be used by protesters around the globe for its symbolism.

CHARLESTON, W.Va. — A private college in West Virginia said Wednesday it is removing the name of the late U.S. Sen. Robert C. Byrd from its health center, saying his name had caused “divisiveness and pain” without explicitly noting his complicated past on racial matters.
Byrd was a member of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1940s but subsequently denounced the organization. He served in the Senate for 51 years and died in 2010 at age 92.
Bethany College President Tamara Rodenberg said on the school’s website that Byrd’s name will be removed from the college’s Robert C. Byrd Health Center “to demonstrate Bethany College’s capacity to change, to listen, and to learn.”
Bethany’s statement did not specifically mention Byrd’s past ties to the Klan.
“Our lives are marked by decisions, by actions, and by grace, and today we embrace all three in a tangible, visible way at our beloved Bethany College,” Rodenberg wrote.
Bethany College’s statement said the college recognized in the past few weeks that Byrd’s name attached to the health center “created divisiveness and pain for members of Bethany community, both past and present.”

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Little Rock is banning police from using neck restraints following nationwide protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Mayor Frank Scott said Wednesday.
Scott signed an executive order banning use of the restraints or officers being trained on them, and also requiring officers to intervene to stop their use if they witness it. Scott’s order also requires the city to create and maintain a database on the restraints’ use and any corrective actions taken against officers for using them.
Little Rock Police Chief Keith Humphrey said the department had already banned chokeholds but had allowed a technique known as a “vascular neck restraint.”
The order doesn’t prohibit an officer from using “any reasonable force” if because of actual physical contact they face immediate threat of death or serious injury to themselves or anyone in their immediate vicinity.

HUNTINGTON, W.Va. — A city council in West Virginia has unanimously approved a proposal to make Juneteenth a permanent city holiday. The celebration, which commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S., is held annually on June 19.
Huntington Mayor Steve Williams told council members before Wednesday’s vote that it was important for city leaders to make such a statement.
“It doesn’t change the matter of life and livelihood for our African-American, black neighbors in our community,” Williams said. “But it does send a message. It sends a message that we’re standing shoulder to shoulder, arm in arm, heart to heart, that we have every expectation — not intention — expectation that we’re going to stand by them and make sure that the injustices that are present in our society are overcome.”
The city of about 45,000 residents along the Ohio River has a black population of about 9%.
Williams said the idea came from meetings with his diversity advisory committee amid the international protests following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a Minneapolis officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck as he pleaded for air.
City workers will get the paid holiday off.

BATON ROUGE, La. — A Louisiana lawmaker’s effort to eliminate police officers’ wide immunity from civil lawsuits for damages for injury or death was shelved by Republicans on a state House committee.
The House civil law committee voted 9-7 Wednesday against the measure from Democratic Rep. Edmond Jordan.
More than a dozen black lawmakers stood together in the room to support Jordan’s bill. After the vote, some left in tears.
Supporters of the bill said the immunity is so sweeping that it’s nearly impossible to hold officers accountable for excessive force when prosecutors refuse to bring criminal charges.
Opponents said legal avenues exist to prosecute police for excessive force. The Louisiana Sheriffs’ Association said the measure would make it harder for officers to combat crime.
The vote fell largely along party lines. Two GOP lawmakers joined Democrats in backing the measure, which was proposed after the death last month of George Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody and other recent instances of police brutality.
___
PORTLAND, Ore. — City commissioners voted Wednesday to cut $16 million from the Portland Police Bureau’s budget in response to concerns about police brutality and racial injustice.
The cuts are part of a city budget approved by the commissioners in a 3-1 vote. The money saved by eliminating the gun reduction violence team, school resource officers and transit officers will be redirected to social service programs. The lone commissioner to vote no said the cuts to police weren’t deep enough.
Thousands of protesters have filled the streets of Portland every night for three weeks following the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis on Memorial Day.

ATLANTA — The police officer who fatally shot Rayshard Brooks in the back after the fleeing man pointed a stun gun in his direction is going to be charged with felony murder and 10 other crimes.
Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard made the announcement about Garrett Rolfe during a news conference Wednesday.
Howard said Rolfe kicked Brooks while he lay on the ground and that the officer with him, Devin Brosnan, stood on Brooks’ shoulder as he struggled for life Friday night.
Rolfe had already been fired after he fatally shot the 27-year-old Brooks. Brosnan had been put on administrative leave.
Brosnan is being charged with aggravated assault and other crimes. The shooting had sparked new demonstrations in Georgia’s capital against police brutality.

 BOSTON — Police officers in Massachusetts would have to be certified by the state under a bill filed Wednesday by Gov. Charlie Baker.
The bill would also allow for the decertification of officers who engage in excessive force, and it encourages additional training, including for advanced deescalation techniques.
Massachusetts is one of only a few states without a statewide certification program for law enforcement.
The Republican governor said his administration worked with members of the Massachusetts Black and Latino Legislative Caucus and public safety officials to draft the bill.
Baker said at a press conference that the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis at the hands of police officers made it clear it's ""the time to get this done.” He added that improving law enforcement is only one piece of the process.

LONDON — The governing body of Oxford University’s Oriel College has recommended the removal of a statue of Victorian imperialist Cecil Rhodes that has long been the target of protests.
The college’s governors, made up of faculty, met Wednesday and said they had “voted to launch an independent Commission of Inquiry into the key issues surrounding the Rhodes statue.“
A similar campaign has sought the removal of his statue in Oxford. The movement has gained new momentum since the death of George Floyd spurred anti-racism protests around the world.
Rhodes made a fortune from gold and diamond mines in the late 19th century, with miners laboring in brutal conditions. His statue was removed from the University of Cape Town in South Africa in 2015.

RICHMOND, Va. — A statue of African American tennis star Arthur Ashe has been vandalized.
Photos show the base of the monument tagged with white spray paint and the words “white lives matter” as well as the initials “WLM.” Those initials were later painted over with “BLM,” short for black lives matter.
Richmond Police said they were alerted to the vandalism on Monument Avenue about 10:15 a.m. Wednesday. Police say red paint on the statue itself was already being removed by community members.
Authorities have information on possible suspects and are asking the community to call the Crime Stoppers line if they have information on who was responsible for the vandalism.
The monument was dedicated in 1996 to memorialize the Richmond native, who died in 1993, and to counterbalance the string of statues on Memorial Avenue dedicated to Confederate leaders.

LAS VEGAS — The University of Nevada, Las Vegas has removed a statue of its “Hey Reb!” mascot from in front of its alumni center following an outcry from student groups, including the Native American Student Association.
The decision to remove the bronze statue, which was criticized for its relationship to the Confederacy, came weeks after the death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis.
University President Marta Meana says she has had conversations with individuals and stakeholders about how the university can move forward in light of recent events.
The statue is expected to be returned to its donors.

NEW YORK — New York’s governor signed an executive order recognizing Juneteenth as a paid holiday for state employees to commemorate the emancipation of slaves in the U.S.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo called it “a day we should all reflect upon” and “a day that is especially relevant in this moment in history."" Cuomo said he’ll propose legislation next year making June 19 a permanent state holiday.
President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation was effective Jan. 1, 1863, but the news took time to travel. It wasn’t until June 19, 1865, when word of the proclamation was brought by the Union army to enslaved people in Texas.

AMSTERDAM — Vandals have daubed red paint and the word “racist” on a statue of Mohandas Gandhi in Amsterdam, amid a wave of attacks on statues around the world of controversial historical figures.
A worker cleaned the statue Wednesday with a high-pressure water hose. Gandhi, widely lauded for his peaceful campaign to win independence for India, has faced criticism for some of his writings about black Africans.
A lawyer, Gandhi traveled to South Africa in 1893 and stayed for two decades, fighting to expand rights for Indians there. He has faced criticism for referring in his writings to black South Africans as backward. However, he later changed his views and supported the rights of black South Africans.
His nonviolent resistance methods have been used in movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.

DETROIT — A white suburban Detroit police chief has been suspended for 30 days without pay and will undergo diversity training for inappropriate social media posts about people protesting the death of George Floyd.
Trustees in Macomb County’s Shelby Township voted 5-2 on Tuesday night on the punishment for chief Robert J. Shelide, who has held the title since 2015.
Shelide, who earlier apologized, told the township board before the vote that he is “not a racist” and “I bleed blue.”
Shelide had been on administrative leave the past two weeks while officials investigated posts on a now-deleted Twitter account. Screenshots posted on Facebook show one tweet spoke about the need to “unleash real cops” and describing protesters as “barbarians” and needing “body bags.“

PORTLAND, Ore. — Police say a man drove his car into a crowd of protesters early Wednesday in downtown Portland, injuring three people.
Police say the 27-year-old male driver drove away “at a high rate of speed,” but was tracked and arrested on suspicion of hit and run, reckless driving and possession of a controlled substance, according to The Oregonian/OregonLive.
Two people were taken by ambulance to a hospital. Another was taken for treatment in a personal car. Police say none of the injuries were life-threatening.
___
ATLANTA — Georgia’s lieutenant governor is proposing a version of a hate crimes law for the state.
Republican Geoff Duncan called on lawmakers to create a free-standing hate crime and include more categories of bias crimes. Those would involve people victimized because of their culture and their status in exercising First Amendment rights, including worship, free speech, free press, assembly or petition of government.
A previous effort was found unconstitutional by the state Supreme Court more than a decade ago.
In February, Ahmaud Arbery was shot near Brunswick, Georgia. Investigators have said a white man uttered a racial slur after chasing Arbery down and shooting him.
Georgia’s House passed a simpler measure last year that’s been stalled in a Senate committee for more than year. The bill would add extra penalties onto crimes committed because of someone’s race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, mental disability or physical disability.

GENEVA — The brother of George Floyd has made a heartfelt plea to the U.N.’s top human rights body to launch intense international scrutiny of systemic racism and the killing of unarmed blacks by police.
Philonese Floyd’s message by video to the Human Rights Council came as it contemplates an unprecedented bid sought by the Africa Group to create a Commission of Inquiry — the council’s most powerful tool of scrutiny — to examine and report on racism and violence against protesters by police in the United States.
“I am my brother’s keeper. You in the United Nations are your brothers and sisters’ keepers in America — and you have the power to help us get justice for my brother George Floyd,” Floyd said. “I am asking you to help him. I am asking you to help me. I am asking you to help us: Black people in America.”

HUNTINGTON, W.Va. — The Huntington City Council in West Virginia will vote Wednesday on a proposal to make Juneteenth a permanent city holiday.
The celebration commemorates when enslaved people in Texas learned they were free on June 19, 1865. Huntington Mayor Steve Williams told The Herald-Dispatch he supports the proposal and wants the city’s African American residents to know “the city celebrates Juneteenth with them just as we all celebrate July Fourth together.”
The mayor says the idea for the holiday proposal came from meetings with his diversity advisory committee amid the international protests following the death of George Floyd. Williams expects Wednesday’s meeting will help fast-track the resolution so council members can get it in the books before Friday.
The Emancipation Proclamation was signed by President Abraham Lincoln on Jan. 1, 1863, and freed enslaved people of the rebellion Confederate states.

HOUSTON — Officials say a statue of a Confederate soldier has been removed from a downtown Houston park and a second Confederate statue is expected to be removed soon.
The “Spirit of the Confederacy” statue was removed late Tuesday from Sam Houston Park. Mayor Sylvester Turner said last week the statue will be housed in the Houston Museum of African American Culture.
A second statue, of Confederate artillery commander Richard W. “Dick” Dowling, is also slated for removal. Initially, the Dowling statue was to be moved from Houston’s Hermann Park to the Sabine Pass Battleground State Historical Site near Port Arthur.
But officials say the Dowling statue will instead be placed in a warehouse, at least temporarily, after leaders in Port Arthur expressed opposition.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — A Roman Catholic chaplain at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has resigned at the request of the archdiocese after sending an email suggesting the killing of George Floyd was not an act of racism and he hadn’t lived “a virtuous life.”
The Archdiocese of Boston asked the Rev. Daniel Patrick Moloney to step down June 9 after he sent the message to Catholics at MIT, The Boston Globe reports. A statement from the archdiocese said Moloney’s comments “were wrong and by his resignation he accepts the hurt they have caused.”
The archdiocese learned about the email from Catholics at MIT and alumni. Moloney says he was trying to speak out against “cancel culture” and regrets his message has been misunderstood.
Suzy Nelson, an MIT vice president and dean for student life, sent an email to students calling Moloney’s comments “deeply disturbing” and “Father Moloney’s message failed to acknowledge the dignity of each human being and the devastating impact of systemic racism.”

Phil Murphy signs legislation that passed the Assembly on Thursday. First, though, the Senate would have to approve the Assembly decriminalization bill, or a Senate measure that would be even more lenient on the possession of up to a pound of cannabis. Senate President Steve Sweeney (D-Gloucester) has yet to decide whether to post a decriminalization bill and wants to be sure its passage won't hurt the chances of the legalization ballot[1] question. 
The marijuana bill was one of eight approved Thursday that supporters called a package of social-justice reforms. All of the bills cleared the Assembly after moving quickly through committee Monday in response to the recent killings of a number of African Americans and nationwide protests that have followed. Most of the other bills deal with police-related reforms, including the classification of chokeholds as use of force that would only be justified in limited circumstances. Making possession of less than two ounces of marijuana a civil penalty with a $50 fine is only part of A-1897[2]/A-4269, which passed the Assembly 63-10 with 13 Republicans joining all Democrats present in voting 'yes.' The measure would also reduce penalties for possessing up to five pounds of marijuana or hashish; expand expungement for prior offenses; prevent discrimination by employers, banks or landlords based on these drug crimes and make information about marijuana and hashish offenses confidential.Reducing trauma for future generations'This is only one piece of the many parts of change that must be done in the name of social justice for our communities,' said Assemblyman Benjie Wimberly (D-Passaic), one of the bill's sponsors. 'The War on Drugs in many ways became a war on particular communities, incarcerating millions of people and affecting families irreparably for decades. The action we take now to help our black and brown communities who have been disproportionately affected by current laws surrounding cannabis use is critical to trauma for future generations.' On Monday, during a hearing by the Assembly Community Development and Affairs Committee on all the bills, several speakers cited various statistics showing the large number of marijuana arrests. Charlana McKeithen, executive director of Garden State NORML, said 36,000 people were arrested for marijuana possession in 2018, with African Americans arrested at rates more than three times higher than whites. According to NORML, 24 states and the District of Columbia have already enacted some form of decriminalization[3], with Virginia slated to become the 25th on July 1. These include New York, Delaware and Maryland. Under current law, the distribution of less than one ounce of marijuana in New Jersey or less than five grams of hashish is a crime of the fourth degree that can be punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to 18 months, a fine of up to $10,000, or both. The bill would make possession or distribution of less than two ounces of marijuana a civil matter carrying a $50 fine. It's unclear whether Murphy would sign this specific bill, but he did say[4] last November he supported the concept and wanted to see the Legislature pass 'sensible decriminalization legislation as soon as possible.'Legalization ballot questionEleven states and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational marijuana. The New Jersey Legislature could not muster enough votes in the last legislative session to legalize pot but did pass in December a measure[5] placing the legalization question before voters in November. If approved, the use of recreational marijuana would become legal in New Jersey on Jan. 1. An April poll[6] by the Monmouth University Polling Institute said 61% of participants would vote for the legalization question. DeVaughn Ward, senior legislative counsel with the Marijuana Policy Project, said that's no reason for lawmakers to hold off passing a decriminalization bill now. The bill would take effect 90 days after its enactment. 'Police make a marijuana possession arrest in New Jersey every 22 minutes,' he said. 'This means that unless the Legislature enacts decriminalization between now and Election Day, thousands of New Jerseyans will have their lives turned upside down by cannabis possession arrests This bill is of urgent importance because we've seen the cannabis justification used repeatedly in civil rights tragedies throughout the nation.' Pundits differ on whether voters will back the legalization question in November, given the uncertainties of the status of COVID-19 and whether the election will be conducted entirely by mail-in ballot. The ballot question would amend the state Constitution to allow the growing, packaging, retail purchasing and consumption of cannabis by those age 21 or older. It would also create mechanisms for the oversight and taxing of legal cannabis. 'The fact that you saw some bipartisan support for decriminalization further indicates that, at least according to the polls, it's a popular issue,' said Ben Dworkin, founding director of the Rowan Institute for Public Policy and Citizenship. 'That's why it's widely assumed it will pass in November.' Matt Hale, a political science professor at Seton Hall University, is not so sure.Not a 'slam dunk''Legalization has never been a slam dunk,' he said.'There is some significant opposition in the black community and in some suburbs. Marijuana legalization might feel kind of a second tier issue with all the crazy and scary things going on in the world right now. People might not want to add more uncertainty into the mix right now Even so, polls consistently show that New Jersey residents support both decriminalization and legalization.' A spokesman for Sweeney said the Senate president supports both the decriminalization and legalization, but wants to discuss with members of the Democratic caucus the best way to proceed. 'Senator Sweeney's primary motivation is the social-justice reforms this will produce,' said Richard McGrath, Sweeney's spokesman. 'He wants to work in collaboration with his colleagues in the Senate Democratic caucus to balance out the best timing to act. It's a strategic decision to make sure the policy goal is achieved.' Three Senate Democrats introduced their own decriminalization bill earlier this month. S-2535[7] goes even further than the measure the Assembly passed Thursday. For instance, it would decriminalize the possession or distribution of up to a pound of marijuana, with a written warning for the first offense and either a $25 fine or community service for subsequent offenses. 'Whether or not voters decide to legalize marijuana in November, this should not change our stance on moving forward with the decriminalization of marijuana,' said Sen. Ron Rice (D-Essex), one of the sponsors, on the bill's introduction. 'We cannot wait until the fall while countless members of the black and brown communities are targeted for marijuana-related offenses. If this state really wants to push social-justice reform without an economic reward, this is how you achieve that goal.' That bill, which includes other reforms related to marijuana possession that are similar to those in the Assembly measure, was referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Seven other social justice measures passed the Assembly Thursday, all with little or no opposition. They are: A-744[8], which would require law enforcement agencies to disclose the entire internal affairs and personnel files of law enforcement officers who are prospective candidates for employment with another agency, codifying a change Attorney General Gurbir Grewal directed last year. A-1076[9], which would require Grewal to create a program to collect, record and analyze data on adult defendants, from the time a defendant is arrested or charged through the final disposition of a case, including race, ethnicity, gender and age, as well as such details as dismissed or downgraded charges, plea agreements and court fees and fines. A-1906[10], which would make it a third degree crime to call police or file a police report under false pretenses to intimidate a person based on race or other characteristics protected by the state's bias crimes law. A-2394[11], which would require all law enforcement agencies in the state to establish minority recruitment and selection programs. A-3641[12], which would mandate all state, county, municipal and campus law enforcement agencies provide implicit cultural diversity and implicit bias training. A-4263[13], which would classify the use of chokeholds or actions with a similar result as deadly force that would be justified only if necessary to protect the officer or another person from death or serious bodily injury, to arrest or prevent the escape of a violent criminal, or to prevent the commission of a violent crime. A-4275[14], which would expand the sources for juror lists to include those who receive several forms of state assistance or hold a non-driver identification card issued by the state Motor Vehicle Commission to create a more diverse pool of candidates.

64,/content/Bias_Crime_Lexis_1.DOCX,Newstex Blogs,2020-10-08,988 words,,Tim Cushing,,ICE Spent Your Tax Dollars Dragging A Journalist Through The Internet Sewer Over A Mistake She Apologized For,False,"Oct 08, 2020( Techdirt: http://www.techdirt.com Delivered by Newstex) Law enforcement officers protect their own[1]. Even when they shouldn't[2]. They are quick to react when one of them is slighted and they do so knowing their position as arbiters of law affords them more protection against internet randos than the little people they're supposed to be serving. But something that gets lost in these far-too-common reactions is that this is how taxpayers' money is being spent: on vindictive actions that could have been handled with a 30-second statement or a press release that might take all of 20 minutes to compose. But instead of letting things go and realizing their position of power is probably all the response that's needed, tax dollars are spent converting hurt feelings into investigations of private citizens who managed to offend the powers that be. Ken Klippenstein has obtained documents from a FOIA request[3] (and the de rigueur[4] FOIA lawsuit) that shows ICE decided to get all investigatory when someone mistook a tattoo on one of its officials for a racist symbol. 
That this person was a journalist makes it all that more problematic.In June of 2018, Talia Lavin, then a fact-checker for The New Yorker, found herself in an unusual position for a journalist: She personally became the target of a government agency. She had come under the scrutiny of ICE's Office of Public Affairs, the public face of the agency that played a central role in President Trump's crackdown on undocumented migrants. [...] When Lavin saw a tweet[5] from ICE featuring one of its officials, Justin Gaertner, with a cross-shaped tattoo, she wondered if it was the Iron Cross familiar to Nazi iconography. She posted a tweet comparing them. When people began pointing out that it could be another symbol, like a Maltese cross, Lavin promptly removed the tweet. But it was already too late.ICE first responded with a press release. It was not your normal press release[6]. It accused Lavin (mentioning her name [but misspelled as ""Levin"") of ""baselessly slandering"" the ""American hero"" who worked for the agency. It demanded an apology and a retraction from Lavin and The New Yorker. Following ICE's public flogging of Lavin, she became a target for vitriol and abuse by white supremacists and alt-right figureheads[7]. Fox News called her a ""little journo terrorist.""[8] Eye for an eye and all that, I guess. You'd think ICE would have been satisfied with the shitstorm it had stirred up. It provoked a response and got some of what it wanted. Lavin not only apologized[9] but she resigned from The New Yorker. ICE's main focus -- according to the documents obtained by Klippenstein -- was securing the future of the official pointed out in Lavin's since-deleted tweet. The Public Affairs office began burnishing the official's war record and claimed to have evidence of credible threats to the official's life. But the only ""threat"" detailed in email threads was one from someone responding to Lavin's tweet, stating that the person wished whoever had wounded the official in combat ""would've finished the job."" Cue a whole bunch of government gears, all grinding tax dollars into salve for skin-deep scratches.'HSI Tampa will be carefully assessing the twitter based threats and will take appropriate action,' an HSI official replied. 'Looping in AD [Assistant Director] Ip for C3 [ICE Cyber Crimes Center] support. HSI Tampa will be submitting a SIR [Significant Incident Report] shortly.'More remarkably, the email communications indicate ICE may never have seen Lavin's tweet before it was deleted. ICE's press office -- for all the time it spent making sure its official remained unslighted -- didn't bother preserving the tweet it found so offensive that it issued a press release decrying the person who had published it. One tweet by a journalist containing one innocent mistake (it's no secret white supremacists are drawn to law enforcement positions[10]) led to multiple DHS agencies being apprised of non-credible threats while ICE's public affairs office decided it was in the best interest of the public to publicly attack a journalist for screwing up. It got what it wanted -- a retraction, an apology, and a resignation -- but at what cost? Certainly ICE took a hit to its credibility. It may have been correct about the innocuous nature of the tattoo, but it made its point by turning a journalist into a target for internet pitchforks. This is called ""punching down."" It could have issued a statement in support of the official and left it at that, but instead, it felt compelled to turn this into a public flogging and an internal investigation handled so sloppily the multi-billion dollar agency couldn't even search the Wayback Machine for the tweet prompting its deluge of unprofessional behavior.

65,/content/Bias_Crime_Lexis_1.DOCX,CNN New Day 7:00 AM EST,2020-06-10,4147 words,NEWS; Domestic,"John Berman, Alisyn Camerota, Boris Sanches, Laura Jarrett, Bakari Sellers",,GOP Struggles With Demands To Overhaul Policing And Address Racism; Georgia Officials Call For Investigations Into Voting Issues. Aired 7-7:30a ET,False,"[07:00:00]
ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN NEW DAY: We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and all around the world. This is New Day.
In the space of a little more than two weeks, change has begun in the U.S. 12 cities and municipalities have taken action to ban chokeholds by police officers after George Floyd's killing. And in just a few hours, Floyd's brother will testify before the House Judiciary Committee on how to move forward from here.
House Democrats have already proposed sweeping reforms to policing. Republicans are now drafting plans of their own. But President Trump's contribution, so far, has been to spread a blatant lie about a 75- year-old peace activist who was shoved to the ground and injured by a Buffalo police officer.
JOHN BERMAN, CNN NEW DAY: There are now developments this morning in the investigation of George Floyd's death. Minneapolis News Station KMSP is reporting that Derek Chauvin, the officer who pinned George Floyd to the pavement with his knee to his neck for nearly nine minutes, was in talks to plead guilty before he was arrested and charged with murder. Those negotiations reportedly fell apart.
Meanwhile, there are calls for investigations about voting problems in Georgia. A complete meltdown is what the Atlanta Journal Constitution called it after voters waited hours in line in the hot sun yesterday. Absentee ballot applications never returned. So why did this all happen? And can it be fixed by November?
Let's begin though on Capitol Hill with our Boris Sanchez. And, Boris, we are seeing actual plans for change now.
BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right, John. Philonise Floyd set to testify before the House Judiciary Committee. He is set to tell his brother, George's story, to share the pain and grief that he's experienced and losing his brother to law enforcement. And he is part of a list of witnesses that are set to build a case that systemic racism in law enforcement is real and needs to be addressed.
That is something that President Trump has not acknowledged. The president standing firm in his law and order stance, still deliberating whether or not he's going to address the issue on the issue of racial unity. Aides to the president tell CNN that in recent days, they've tried to relay their own personal experiences with racism to the president. Sources tell us that the president has been open to that, that he's been receptive.
They also tell us that the president is open to some kind of police reform legislation, though the details of that remain murky. The president sending his chief of staff, Mark Meadows, and his son-in- law, Jared Kushner, to Capitol Hill yesterday, to meet with Senator Tim Scott, who is leading the Republican Senate effort to build some form of legislation.
A draft of that legislation was released yesterday. It is much more measured than the Democrat version that was released on Monday from Democrats in the House. It includes a far-ranging set of motions, including anti-lynching measures, as well as a ban on chokeholds nationally. The Republican version does not include that. It essentially leaves a ban on chokeholds up to local governments.
We should point out, already, a number of local governments and municipalities have banned chokeholds, have banned that practice, places like Washington, D.C., New York, Miami, et cetera. It is still a very wide-open question what these two sides are willing to compromise on and, of course, what President Trump will finally sign off on. John?
BERMAN: Yes, Boris Sanchez on Capitol Hill. President Trump is nowhere on this right now, hasn't said a thing about what he would expect or what he wants to see, and that's crucial.
So joining us now, CNN Early Start Anchor, Laura Jarrett, who covered the Justice Department for a while, CNN Political Commentator Bakari Sellers is here with us, as well. He's the author of the book, My Vanishing Country.
Laura, let's put it back up on the screen so people can see these various proposals. The Democratic proposal is in writing at this point. In addition, it includes significant changes to the qualified immunity enjoyed by police officers in terms of lawsuits right now. And you can see some of the ideas being kicked around by Republican Senator Tim Scott. Again, it doesn't go as far as the Democratic plan.
But a couple of things are notable, really, to me, Laura. Number one is that Republicans haven't been critical of the Democratic plan yet. They're not bashing it the way that plans normally get bashed when proposed by one party or another, which indicates to me they know that they have to come up with something, which is why you're seeing Republican Senator Tim Scott scrambling right now.
[07:05:00]
They know that the country is calling for action now.
LAURA JARRETT, CNN ANCHOR: Yes, they're reading the room. They realize that they need to do something. And, look, federal policy is important. It makes a lot of sense in Tim Scott's version to say to states, look, if you're not having officers turn on body cameras, that's a problem and we may have to withhold funding.
But I think the concern for a lot of people is that these are just crumbs and really scratching at the surface of a much, much broader problem, that they will do these things, they will pack up and go home and say, you know what, our job is done. When in reality, a lot of the policing issues are happening at the local level. That's why we see so many states banning chokeholds.
And even in those cases, a lot of other people are saying, look, you know, some of these reforms we're seeing on the local level don't go far enough. In Minneapolis, officers had to go through cultural sensitivity training and that still didn't help George Floyd.
CAMEROTA: And, Bakari, isn't it strange to hear nothing from the president? I mean, I know we're three years into this and nothing should surprise us, but silence, while these nationwide protests, while all of the polls suggest that the public sentiment has changed in the past two weeks. And you see Congress taking action quickly, which is also striking, and nothing, no statement from the president other than these conspiracy theory, repugnant tweets. He gets them off of some fake cable network that finds them on a fringe website. That's the message he wants to put out.
BAKARI SELLERS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I'm not surprised. And I actually think that the country can better heal itself if the president stays out of this. I know that's kind of unique to say that we don't need to involve the president of the United States in one of the largest issues that it's facing right now at its most critical juncture we've had in the most recent 50 or 60 years, but that's the case. I mean, we can go without Donald Trump.
I am excited that Tim Scott is at the table. I am excited that Tim Scott is pushing forth ideas. And I know that these ideas may not go far enough to address the systemic racism that we have that's at the core of many of our systems in this country. However, Tim Scott does come with these experiences. I'm interested to see the testimony today from George Floyd's brother.
On the other hand though, you actually have people in the Republican Party, we have to be mindful, who believe that -- who believe that systemic racism does not exist. I mean, Dan Bongino is testifying on behalf of the Republicans. So you're going to have this messaging come out and emanate from the Republican Party that says that systemic racism does not exist. That's why I'm happy that Tim Scott is at the table. And I do believe something will happen.
But to Laura's point, now that George Floyd has been buried, now that we're shifting gears into solutions, will we be bold in trying to fix these solutions, or will we just nibble around the edges and move on?
BERMAN: Well, Laura, what's the difference? Can I ask? I mean, if we can put up on the screen so people can see the various proposals that are being, the ones by the Democrats and the ones by Republicans, what would count as a major structural change and what counts as nibbling around the edges? JARRETT: Well, I think the qualified immunity issue is actually a huge deal. And it may sound like sort of legal mumbo jumbo, but it's a big deal. Because what it means is essentially federal officers are off the hook, unless there has been a clearly established rule, which means that the Supreme Court has actually spoken on that issue, officers can point to that and say, look, I am not guilty in this case. And so I think there are actually legal rules that have allowed for a long time people not to be held accountable.
But I also think that, you know, senators need to listen to their communities and what their communities are asking for. And a lot of cases, it's not just reform measures. They want to radically change how policing is done. I mean, our T.V. screens are full right now of an enormous amount of police using force on citizens, even after the death of George Floyd. And so I think they're trying to -- the protesters are really right to reimage what police would look like in this country.
CAMEROTA: Former Vice President Joe Biden is trying to, I guess, well, be a voice for all of this and step into the void that President Trump is leaving. And so last night, he did talk about his view on systemic racism. Listen to this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
NORAH O'DONNELL, CBS NEWS ANCHOR: Do you believe there is systemic racism in law enforcement?
JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Absolutely. But it's not just in law enforcement. It's across the board. It's in housing and it's in education and it's in everything we do. It's real, it's genuine, it's serious.
Look, not all law enforcement officers are racist. My Lord, there are some really good, good cops out there. But the way in which it works right now, and we've seen too many examples of it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CAMEROTA: Bakari, do you think that he's having some impact? Do you think his voice is being heard in the middle of all of this tumult?
[07:10:01]
SELLERS: Yes, I mean, that was pitch perfect. I mean, that is what people of color, black folks have been screaming for 40, 50, 60 years. I mean, Alisyn and John, think about this. It took us seven years to get to the point where people would even say Black Lives Matter. I mean, seven years, that's how long the movement has been going and now finally people are saying it and we're putting forth solutions and we have a candidate for president of the United States who acknowledges this.
This moment is larger than George Floyd. And that's the challenge. This is a -- this is a seminal moment in our country's history. And it seems as if Joe Biden is ready to tackle that moment, even with all of his flaws and even with some of his stumbles, he's ready to tackle the moment.
On the flip side, you have to look at Donald Trump, who's ill-equipped for this moment. And we talk about, where is Donald Trump? I know that The Rock, Dwayne Johnson, had this amazing and lengthy video on social media asking, where is our leader? Well, many times you don't want the arsonist coming back and doing something with the fire.
And so we sit here today just thirsting for leadership, but that leadership has to have empathy. We have an empathy void in this country, one that Donald Trump cannot feel. And the question is whether or not people will support Joe Biden and he'll continue to lift this message up between now and November.
BERMAN: The thing is, the president has to sign a legislation if Congress passes something and the president has to sign it. So he can't be completely removed from this process. And in terms of what he's doing, we saw what he was doing yesterday with this just absurd, blatant lie about Martin Gugino, the 75-year-old peace activist in Buffalo who was pushed to the ground, blood pouring from his head, suggesting it was some kind of conspiracy theory.
Now, I agree with you on the sense, Bakari, it's not surprising from the president at this point. We've seen that before. Just because it's not surprising though doesn't mean that it's offensive. And it should be easy for politicians of any flavor or party to condemn such a statement. But look how not eased it was. Look how hard Republicans worked. Look at the gymnastics that they performed, trying to avoid these questions yesterday.
Listen to this.

REPORTER: What about the president's tweet though? Was that appropriate, sir?
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): As I said, we are discussing in the Senate Republican Conference, what response we think is appropriate to the events of the last two weeks.
REP. KEVIN KRAMER (R-ND): I just saw the tweet and I know nothing of the episode, so I don't know. I'm not as fixated, I guess, as some people.
MANU RAJU, CNN SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: You saw the president's tweet this morning when he talked about this Buffalo protester.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I haven't read the damn thing, I don't want to hear it.
RAJU: I know.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BERMAN: Okay. You could have just said, it was bad, he shouldn't have done it. That took me less than three seconds to say. But each of those senators pulled a muscle trying to avoid a question there.
Laura, you can see them just -- it just seems like such an opportunity missed to take a stand.
JARRETT: Look, time and again, they have made their gamble that they don't have to say anything and that he will do something else and the media cycle will move on and we will go through this over and over and over again. But the real test is what happens in November and whether people are actually going to hold their elected officials accountable.
We have seen already, Trump's poll numbers are slipping, and the campaign knows it. Even among white evangelicals, they don't like what they're seeing. The question is just what actually happens when people go to the polls.
CAMEROTA: Yes. And, Bakari, I mean, it has become just so notable when Republicans now do speak out against the president's tweets. I mean, now it -- when Mitt Romney says it was a shocking thing to say, and I won't dignify it with further comment, when, you know, Senator Thune says, it's a serious accusation, which should only be made with facts and evidence and I haven't seen any, and when Lisa Murkowski says, it just makes no sense that we're fanning the flames at this time. This is not good. That is notable and do you think that is a shift?
SELLERS: That's a good question, Alisyn. I mean, the bar is so low. I mean, I remember back in the day when we actually were mad at a president for wearing a tan suit or using Dijon mustard. I mean, that's where we once were. I mean, this is absurd.
And to applaud Mitt Romney or Murkowski or actually having some semblance of character is -- I just don't want to applaud that. I think that the damage that Donald Trump has done to the Republican Party is something that's going to be felt for the next decade.
I mean, I'm not the person to do it, and I'm not smart enough, but I wish there was someone who could come on this show and write a book on how Donald Trump has crumbled the moral fiber of the Republican Party, how he shifted the moral compass of this party, how he's lowered the standards and expectations of the White House from someone who was held to the highest standard, the black man we had elected, the 44th president, to someone who can literally, if he puts together a complete sentence we cheer for, and if people speak out against him being rude, we count that as a victory for that person.

My, my, my, things have changed in just four years. And the bar is so low that it only takes a little bitty hop. Maybe even John Berman can get over it.
BERMAN: Even I can jump higher than that bar.
Bakari Sellers, you have written a book, I should note, it's called, My Vanishing Country, now available in bookstores, and now I hope that you feel bad for making fun of me now that I've promoted your book. CAMEROTA: And his hopping skills.
BERMAN: Thanks, Bakari, I appreciate it. Laura Jarrett, great to have you on.
So it has been called a complete meltdown in Georgia. What happened yesterday when voters tried to cast their votes, what a mess, in line for hours, absentee ballots never delivered, what went on here? We ask the state's lieutenant governor, next.
CAMEROTA: Officials in Georgia are calling for an investigation after this scene played out at polling places yesterday.
[07:20:05]
Voters stood in line for hours after a cascade of problems with voting machines.
The front page of the Atlanta Journal Constitution calls it this morning a complete meltdown.
Joining us now is Georgia's lieutenant governor, Jeff Duncan. Lieutenant Governor Duncan, thank you very much for being here. I know yesterday wasn't easy. Let me just tick through a litany of the complaints that voters had.
Poll workers struggled with the new machines. They didn't feel they had had enough training on the new paperless voting system. There were long lines. The touch screens didn't work. They had to process paper ballots by hand. Many people never received their absentee ballots. Voters had to wait multiple hours in line exposing them to a coronavirus risk. How did Georgia screw this up so badly?
LT. GOV. JEFF DUNCAN (R-GA): Well, thanks for the opportunity to be here. And you know, the sun is starting to rise and we're starting to gather all the information necessary to figure out the things and the areas that we can improve.
I know that here in Georgia, like many other states, there's a split responsibility between the secretary of state and the local county election offices. And certainly, they're all in that process of doing a deep dive and debriefing on opportunities to improve.
You know, I think, you know, you describe many of the issues and the challenges that we faced. We have new machines that are implemented statewide. You've got obviously the coronavirus social distancing and then you've also had a wave of storms come through Atlanta and the Atlanta metro area.
In my particular county, we had no issues. I voted with an absentee ballot. My wife and my 18-year-old son got to vote for the first time and they came home and said that they spent less than 20 minutes in their places. But certainly, we're going to go through a full review here and continue to look for an opportunity to put an even better foot forward in November.
CAMEROTA: Can you guarantee voters there that this will not happen in November?
DUNCAN: Well, certainly, that's the goal, right? I think we can all learn from this and hopefully we can continue to really work on training. I think initial feedback is that we can continue to do a much better job as a state and as counties, individual counties, training the poll workers on the equipment and the processes. But also, I want to encourage everybody here in our state to take an opportunity to potentially volunteer.
I think some of the feedback we got is there wasn't enough volunteers. And, typically, those are going to be older folks, more on the retired side that typically volunteer in those polling centers and obviously with corona, that creates a little bit of an obstacle.
CAMEROTA: It sounds like, as you said here this morning, that you're not that confident or entirely confident that this won't happen again in November.
DUNCAN: Well, certainly, we'll do all that we can do to make sure we put an even better foot forward. And like I said, those techniques are going to be better training, better education, and like we would in the business world, we're going to do a deep dive into the project and we're going to understand the best foot that we can put forward and better techniques to implement as we go forward.
CAMEROTA: Let's talk about the Ahmaud Arbery case. As well know, Georgia is just one of four states that does not have a hate crime law. Investigators say that when Ahmaud Arbery was shot down, a horrible racial slur was uttered in the commission of that crime. And this week, his mother is calling for Georgia to change its ways, to change its laws, and she's calling on you specifically. Let me play for you what she said.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
WANDA COOPER-JONES, MOTHER OF AHMAUD ARBERY: Last year, Georgia statehouse moved in the right direction, passing House bill 426, which will impose harsher sentencing for hate crimes. But the bill has been stalled for a year and state and Senate Leadership refuses to vote on it. Chairman Jesse Stone and Lieutenant Governor Duncan, please do the right thing.
State senators are going back into session. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle support this, pass a hate crime law.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CAMEROTA: When she says, Lieutenant Governor Duncan, please do the right thing, what's your response to her? DUNCAN: Well, I don't think there's anything more powerful than somebody's mother making an appeal. I'm a father of three boys and I look at so many of these situations that continue to arise through the lens of being a father. I mean, how do I answer the questions for my own kids as to how does this happen? What's the remedy to this?
And so House bill 426 is a bill that came over from the House, over to the Senate, and over the last four or five weeks, I've decided to try to become a subject matter expert. I've asked a lot of questions and brought in members of the African-American community, members of the Democratic Party into my office and asked them, what's the best way to move forward? And quite honestly, I think we can do better than House bill 426.
I've been told by an African-American gentlemen sitting in my office that House bill 426, if passed, would be the weakest hate crimes law in the country, and quite honestly, that's not good enough.
[07:25:03]
This past Sunday, we were sitting online watching church and our pastor made a comment. He said, it's not enough to not be racist. We've got to be anti-racism. As I look forward to the next 11 days to craft hate crimes bill that will make Georgia the worst place to commit a hate crime and the best place to love your neighbor. That's the goal we've got over the next 11 legislative days.
I call on my senators in the Senate and in the House to approve the legislation and get it to the governor's desk.
CAMEROTA: So you supportive a hate crime law and you believe in the space of two weeks, you're going to be able to get it done?
DUNCAN: I do. I think we're continuing to build a consensus all across the Senate. I hope to have a bipartisan effort with support from both parties, as we move forward, because, think about it, the mechanics of a hate crimes bill have to be just more than words on a page.
As we analyze this, we need to make sure that we include things like data collection, uniform reporting, we need to make sure that there's an opportunity, potentially for civil recourse. We also have got to make sure that we have the opportunity to, instead of just having a sentence enhancement and have it as sole discretion of the prosecutor, that we actually give the victim to have the opportunity to have a separate charge of a hate crime and allow them to be able to make that presentation in a court case, in a courtroom.
Those are things that I think we can bring together. It's a big ask, I got you. But I'm up for the challenge and I'm ready to lead this effort.
CAMEROTA: Do you think Ahmaud Arbery's Murder was a hate crime?
DUNCAN: Well, certainly, as the data and the facts continue to roll in. But I think one of the most alarming things of this was the way it was handled, even after the incident itself happened. To have to wait months and to watch the process not work, that's troubling also.
And so I think if we can train law enforcement and prosecutors to understand what is a hate crime, what are the right questions to ask, what's the right training to build an investigation around a hate crime? That to me is the way to make this thing continue to trend in a positive direction.
CAMEROTA: But, I mean, yes or no, as of what you know right now, do you believe that Ahmaud Arbery's murder was a hate crime?
DUNCAN: It certainly appears to be a bias-motivated crime, at least from the messaging, but I've not watched the tapes. I've not read the file. My job is to make sure that we put 11 million Georgians in the best possible position each and every day, when they go to work, when they go to church, when they go to school, when they play in their neighborhoods.
It's important for me to make sure that all 11 million Georgians don't fear for any sort of hate crime or bias-motivated crime.
CAMEROTA: Lieutenant Governor Duncan, thank you. We really appreciate you coming on this morning.
DUNCAN: Absolutely. Thank you for the opportunity.
CAMEROTA: The Minneapolis City Council is talking about dismantling their police department, as you know. We find out what that could look like from a city that has already done it successfully, next.

This article examines Police Services and local media discourses on street checks in Hamilton, Ontario, from June 2015 to April 2016 and their usage as a form of psychological abuse known as gaslighting. Despite the widespread coverage that the Hamilton Police Service received as a result of being linked to systemic racist practices, a year later, the Hamilton Police Service was able to avoid being implicated in deliberately conducting racial profiling through strategic tactics in the discourse they relied upon and presented in the media. Through an analysis of 27 local news media articles on the topic of street checks, it is argued that the Police Services and local media discourse enact gaslighting, a form of psychological abuse that is used to manipulate object(s) in order to deceive and undermine the credibility of the target. The psychological effects of gaslighting on people of color included a sense of alienation, disenfranchisement from the community, and distrust toward the police. Through a case study application, it is suggested that gaslighting is part of a systemic, historical process of racism that has been used by the police and government organizations to both illegally target people of color and deny complicity in racial profiling.
FULL TEXT
Everything can be explained to the people, on the single condition that you want them to understand. Fanon (1963, p. 189)
Issues of police brutality, racial profiling, have been sites of struggle for generations (Hernandez, 1990; Morris, 1986; Staples, 1975; Weitzer & Tuch, 2002). The advancement of attention to how blatant systemic racism, dehumanization, and violence persist within policing practice and societal discourse is often the cyclical burden carried by the racialized people affected by these very systems (Dovemark, 2013; Nelson, 2013; Taylor, 1998; van Dijk, 1992). This research drew upon critical theory and critical race theory (CRT) to conduct a critical discourse analysis (CDA) of local news media discourse on police carding and racial profiling in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada relying on focused methodological techniques of grounded theory to examine how racism is attended to, conceptualized, legitimated, or denied from 2015 to 2016.
In Hamilton, Ontario, racism against Canadians of African descent has always been a pervasive and extremely difficult sociohistorical issue. Early histories from the 1800s have recounted anti-Black racism in Hamilton restricting where Black people could shop, eat, and work. Since 1835, the Stewart Memorial Church (then known as St. Paul’s American Methodist Episcopal Church), at John Street North, Hamilton, Ontario, was a refuge for African America slaves crossing the Niagara river via the underground railroad (Gordon, 2016, p. 24). In the 1940s, Reverend John C. Holland, a prominent Black social activist, organized numerous sit-ins in different businesses across Hamilton that did not serve or hire Black Hamiltonians (Gordon, 2016, p. 12). When Stelco steel and other local companies were not hiring Blacks, Holland took several Black men to the locations and convinced the companies to hire them (Gordon, 2016, p. 12). In 1996, the Sesquicentennial Advisory Committee (SAC) organized a celebration for the then upcoming 150th anniversary of the city of Hamilton (Gordon, 2016, p. 24). There were no Black people on the SAC, and initially, this committee did not intend to recognize the significant contributions of Blacks to Hamilton’s history (Gordon, 2016, p. 24). When two prominent Black social activists in Hamilton, Evelyn Myrie and Marlene Thomas Osborne of the Hamilton Black History Committee found out about this lack of representation in the SAC, they attended the SAC’s next meeting and successfully got the SAC to recognize Black History in Hamilton (Gordon, 2016, p. 24). This recognition came via a celebration of Black Hamiltonian history at the inaugural John Holland Awards (Gordon, 2016, p. 24). Twenty years later, the John Holland Awards is still celebrated every February where both Black history and the accomplishments of young Black leaders in Hamilton are celebrated at a dinner gala. This complex history of anti-Black racism in Hamilton can only be recounted alongside the antiracist activism of people such as John C. Holland, Evelyn Myrie, and must also be appreciated within a context of ongoing discrimination against indigenous groups in Hamilton.
These matters are unfortunately not only historical. Recently in 2010, during the R. v. Steele case, a mistrial was declared in a Hamilton courtroom because 25 people of a jury pool of 75 Hamiltonian jurors stated that they were too biased against Blacks to objectively judge the case where the defendant, Richard Steele, a Black man, was appealing a firearms possession case on the basis that the traffic stop that led to the charge was a case of racial profiling (DiManno, 2009). Although the appeal was overturned, the mistrial demonstrated that anti-Black racism is still a major problem in the city. As a statistics Canada report revealed, in 2013, race and ethnicity accounted for half of reported hate crimes in Canada and the city of Hamilton has the second highest number of reported hate crimes of any city in Canada (Allen, 2015). Recently, activism around carding has occurred through the Black, Brown, Red lives matter movement working in solidarity with the Black lives matter events and protests beginning in Ferguson Missouri (Bennett, 2014). More broadly, movements such as Black lives matter and widespread challenges to police brutality and racial profiling have reinvigorated long-standing historical positions of activism while constantly adding to the conversations and analysis (Este, Sato, & McKenna, 2017; Lindsey, 2015; Love, 2016; Yancy, 2016). These movements, challenges, activism, and analyses have advanced attentions to gender, children, ability, and class as well as how we examine the confluence of history and identity (Este et al., 2017; Lindsey, 2015; Love, 2016; Yancy, 2016).
Carding has become a widely discussed issue in Ontario over the last few years. Carding takes places when a police officer stops a person on the street without warrant or without having had a complaint lodged to gather basic information on him or her. The information the police officer collects from the person is usually height, race, gender, age, and any other personal information the officer thinks is relevant to his or her policing. In total, the card has 65 fields where information is stored and categorized (Bennett, 2015). The information is written down on a small card and then transferred to the police database, where the information is permanently stored. Any person can be stopped, even if they did nothing wrong. This issue initially gained traction in the national media when it was announced in Toronto that its police force suspended the practice in January 2015 after the public expressed outrage about the practice (Winsa & Rankin, 2015). Carding is understood as a practice that depends on racial profiling and is a practice used by the Hamilton Police Services (HPS; Hutchinson, 2015; Sayani-Mulji, 2015). The police use carding to gather information on individuals for the purpose of building intelligence with professed intent to protect the community.
Since 2010, the HPS, in particular, the Addressing Crime Trends in Our Neighborhoods (ACTION) team, has used carding as part of a larger socioeconomic initiative for the city to “clean” up the city’s downtown core and improve its growing business (Sayani-Mulji, 2015). This initiative basically encourages and contributes to the continual gentrification of the core while stigmatizing and criminalizing the large percent of Blacks, Indigenous Americans, and poor people who live there. As a result of this initiative, from 2010 to 2014, it is reported that of the approximately 9,000 street checks that were conducted during that time, 12% of those street checks were Blacks although Blacks only make up 3.2% of the city’s population (Bennett, 2015). In comparison, while White people make up 84% of the city’s population, White people made up 75% of the documented street checks conducted from 2010 to 2014, indicating that White people were stopped at a rate of approximately 0.9 times, while Black people were being disproportionately being stopped at a rate of approximately 4.7 times. This indicates that Black people are grossly overrepresented by the Hamilton police database for carding.
Since the summer of 2015, when it was confirmed that the HPS did collect race-based statistics during a street check or a carding, local Hamilton news outlets have extensively covered carding as a major citywide issue that needs to be dealt with. In addition to the widespread coverage of carding in local Hamiltonian news media outlets, the media plays an important role in the generation and the facilitation of a public discussion around carding and how it has broader implications regarding the city’s future and the city’s past.
This article is guided by the following question: How has the HPS’s local news media discourse on carding and racial profiling in Hamilton attended to, conceptualized, legitimated, or denied racism from 2015 to 2016? The resulting analyses suggest that the positions of HPS within local news media discourse on carding resemble a technique of psychological abuse called gaslighting; the term gaslighting is a metaphor for the obfuscation techniques used by HPS through local media to both avoid and undermine racialized and marginalized groups’ arguments against carding and deny that there are historical systemic and structural issues with respect to anti-Black racism in Hamilton. Through strategic discursive maneuvers, including techniques of plausible deniability, the HPS was able to avoid being implicated in claims that its organization is structurally racist by resisting talking about or stating any definition of their practice of street checks to the public, thereby eluding any transparent analyses or public inquiry, allowing them to deflect the public outrage toward carding at the arbitrary nature of the practice. As a result, street checks were regulated instead of being fully banned which did not systemically address racial profiling in the HPS. As demonstrated through this study, through a process of gaslighting, the HPS perpetuated a pattern of sociohistorical traumatization and disenfranchisement of the voices of racialized and marginalized groups in the city.
Methods
This research drew upon critical theory and CRT to conduct a CDA of local news media discourse on carding and racial profiling in Hamilton relying on focused methodological techniques of grounded theory to examine how racism is attended to, conceptualized, legitimated, or denied from 2015 to 2016.
Generally, grounded theory is a qualitative method of research that is grounded in canon but believes that canon should be redefined in order to “fit the realities of qualitative research and the complexities of social phenomena that they seek to understand” (Corbin & Strauss, 1990, p. 418). Grounded theory is based on two principles: The first principle is change and the second principle is determinism. In regard to change, grounded theory sees phenomena as constantly changing (Corbin & Strauss, 1990, p. 418). In terms of determinism, grounded theory rejects both strict determinism and nondeterminism. Instead, “actors are seen as having, though not always utilizing, the means of controlling their destinies by responses to conditions. They are able to make choices according to perceived options” (Corbin & Strauss, 1990, p. 418). The researcher is tasked with observing this interplay. Unlike other forms of both quantitative and qualitative research methods, the goal of grounded theory is to illuminate a discovery found during the researcher’s analysis (Corbin & Strauss, 1990, p. 418), making grounded theory a more open-ended research process.
This research relied upon grounded theory techniques by analyzing 27 articles from local Hamilton news media outlets, coding for themes and generating a theoretical contribution from the data, acknowledging the focus and influence of CRT (with relevant key concepts identified in the methodology section of this article) and an attention to structural discourses of how racism are perceived, talked about, understood, denied, or legitimated. This approach generated knowledge about how the HPS’s media discourse on carding resembled patterns of the psychological abuse technique known as gaslighting.
Specifically, when using techniques from grounded theory, CDA was used to provide focus to the open coding steps. Open coding is “the interpretative process which data are broken down analytically” (Corbin & Strauss, p. 423). This analytical process was used to guide the analysis of the media articles. According to van Dijk (1993), CDA is a form of discourse analysis that seeks to understand “what structures, strategies or other properties of text, talk, verbal interaction or communicative events” contribute to the exercise of social power by elites that lead to social inequality (pp. 249–250). CDA is motivated by current and important social issues (van Dijk, 1993, p. 252). Critical discourse analysts usually take an explicit social political stance. The success or effectiveness of a CDA study is usually evaluated by its relevance to social change (Dijk, 1993, p. 253).
The CDA of the focused coding of the news media articles was influenced by CRT. CRT is part of critical postmodern theory (Ortiz & Janie, 2010, p. 176). Tierney states that CRT is an “attempt[s] to understand the oppressive aspects of society in order to generate societal and individual transformation” (Ortiz & Janie, 2010, p. 176). CRT does not assume all universal truths and it rejects all master narratives. Instead, CRT is based on the following assumptions: “race is a social construction, race permeates all aspects of social life, and race-based ideology is threaded throughout society” (Ortiz & Janie, 2010, p. 176). CRT seeks to locate the voice of the marginalized, it is committed to justice, and it employs the concept of intersectionality (Ortiz & Janie, 2010, p. 176). CRT is necessary for this project, as its inquiry and attentions are to how race and racism are understood as oppressive aspects of society, how it permeates social life, education, and institutions with a commitment to justice (Crenshaw, 1995; Delgado & Stefancic, 2017; Ladson-Billings & Tate, 1995; Solorzano, Ceja, & Yosso, 2000).
The inquiry began with an examination of different Canadian articles ranging from the Toronto Star to the CBC. While these articles provided valuable introductory information concerning what carding is and how important this topic is in Ontario, it was found that the volume of articles about carding that were covered in the country were far too extensive and complex, given the nuances of local, historical contexts across cities to fit the smaller scope of this project. Therefore, the focus was narrowed to Hamilton, with focus on researching articles about carding that were written by local news media outlets that are based in Hamilton. Both authors also are racialized people with lived experience in Hamilton.
The Hamilton Spectator’s Full Text archive was used to search for the media articles. In the search bar, “Hamilton,” “Carding,” and “Street Checks” were used as key terms to make sure the articles looked at examined street checks or carding in the city. The search dates spanned from January 2010, the approximate date the ACTION team started street checks, to June 2015 (the time of the project research and analysis). The search was restricted to all news outlets within the city of Hamilton to focus on local media discourses surrounding the discussion of street checks. These news media outlets are The Hamilton Spectator, Ancaster News, Dundas Star News, Hamilton Mountain News, Stoney Creek News. The search resulted in 27 articles dating from June 2015 to May 2016.
During the data collection and data analysis phase of the research, articles were analyzed, line by line, attending to the patterns of how the HPS’s local news media statements on carding emerged, and how the discussion around carding in general emerged in the local news media outlets. Each article looked at was coded according to how the discussion about carding was being generated. After the initial analysis of the media articles, a pattern emerged as occurring in the HPS’s discourse about race: The way they addressed the public about carding resembled a form of psychological abuse referred to as gaslighting. In general, gaslighting occurs when the abuser (the gaslighter) psychologically manipulates the abused (the gaslightee) by altering something in the gaslightee’s environment and then denying that such a change took place so that the gaslightee will begin to question his or her judgment (Roberts & Andrews, 2013, p. 70). Over time, this cycle of invalidation will gradually diminish the gaslightee’s confidence in his or her judgment to the extent where the gaslighter will establish an authoritarian like dominance over the gaslightee. A more in-depth description of gaslighting components is provided later in the article (beginning on page 31). Drawing from literature on gaslighting, and the possible psychological and political motivations behind this abuse, a historical case study is presented that examines the HPS’s gaslighting techniques within the larger historical context of systemic racism and how the police and the Canadian government has historically perpetuated this abuse. Below we outline some key concepts from CRT that were helpful to the analysis.
Key Concepts
Racial Macroaggressions
Within CRT, the concept of macroaggressions is one that requires a particular appreciation within the analysis presented in this article. Ortiz and Janie describe macroaggressions as “affronts that are not necessarily directed at a specific person but at a group” (Ortiz & Janie, 2010, p. 180). They state that an example of this type of affront would be racial profiling against African Americans where this form of discrimination is not necessarily “directed at particular African Americans as much as it is directed at ‘Blackness’” (Ortiz & Janie, 2010, p. 180). While elaborating on the notion of macroaggression, they indicate that “institutional arrangements […] [are] socially constructed mechanisms that regulate and set norms for social interaction” while reflecting the “beliefs and the values of the dominant society and inherently reflect a racial bias” (Ortiz & Janie, 2010, p. 180). This insight reminds us that people’s actions are a part of institutional arrangements (Ortiz & Janie, 2010, p. 180; Solorzano et al., 2000). The concept of macroaggressions is key to this research because it lends support to the understanding that carding or street checks as a form of racial profiling are a type of macroaggressions that represent and perpetuate institutional arrangements in Hamilton that regulate or permit systemic racism.
White Privilege and White Supremacy
Another aspect of CRT that is critical to this research and analysis is the concept of White privilege. Since racism works systemically, on an institutional level, society has developed institutions in ways that assumes the world views of people of color instead of having representation and the recognition of voice that permits genuine insight into how institutions relate to people of color (Ortiz & Janie, 2010, p. 180). These racial assumptions eventually become ingrained and internalized in the infrastructure of society and act as institutional reminders to individuals and groups to the extent that they are seen as facts (Ortiz & Janie, 2010, p. 181). Abrams and Gibson note that when it comes to the dominant group within Western society—that is, White people—there is no contestation to the idea that society is made for them, or by them thus, resulting in White privilege (Ortiz & Janie, 2010, p. 181). In her essay, White Privilege and Male Privilege: A Personal Account of Coming to See Correspondences Through Work in Women’s Studies, Peggy McIntosh, a feminist scholar and a White female, states that people who are White usually believe that privileges are “conditions of daily experience” that are experienced by everyone, regardless of their race (McIntosh, 1988). McIntosh states that these privileges are actually “unearned power conferred systematically” (McIntosh, 1988). Zeus Leonardo makes an important distinction about the concept of White privilege. He argues that a critical analysis of White privilege must be complimented by an analysis of White supremacy because the two systems go hand in hand (Leonardo, 2004, p. 137). What is important about this distinction is that although these two concepts are related, White privilege is a product of White supremacy (Leonardo, 2004, p. 137). Leonardo states that “In order for white racial hegemony to saturate everyday life, it has to be secured by a process of domination, or those acts, decisions, and policies that white subjects perpetrate on people of color” (Leonardo, 2004, p. 137). Leonardo (2004, p. 138), for example, illustrates the importance of this distinction by using James Scheurich’s image of “being white as akin to walking down the street with money being put into your pant pocket without your knowledge.”. Leonardo subverts this image of White privilege. He states that White supremacy would more like the following description: People of color would have their money taken from their pocket (Leonardo, 2004, p. 138). The people taking the money—that is, a symbol for “material and cultural possessions of people of color—are white” (Leonardo, 2004, p. 138). Leonardo notes that Scheurich’s original image masks the process of domination, especially in regard to who is dominant as a result of this process of domination and instead focuses on the privileges that Whites receive from the process, therefore mistaking the “symptoms for the cause” (Leonardo, 2004, p. 138). Leonardo concisely describes the process of domination. Leonardo states that Whites enjoy privileges through a system of White supremacy. Although this system is complex and multicasual, it generally works in the following way: “set up a system that benefits the group, mystify the system, remove the agents of actions from discourse, and when interrogated about it, stifle the discussion with inane comments about the “reality” of the charges being made (Leonardo, 2004, p. 148). McIntosh, like many other writers on White privilege, is overinvolved in individual perspectives on race and White guilt. By noting that the discourse of White privilege ignores the experiences of the oppressed in a racial hegemony that perpetuates White privilege, Leonardo points out that the discourse of White privilege also caters to the White imagination instead of trying to understand the lived experiences of people of color in North America (Leonardo, 2004, p. 143).
The concept of White supremacy is an important reminder that there is a strong probability that if a White person with no critical knowledge of systemic racism is considering the notion of racism and how it affects their daily life, they may confuse racism as an issue at the personal level instead of the institutional level and therefore, the concept of macroaggressions may escape them completely. This was evident throughout the preliminary analysis of the 27 articles. Not one article gave a thorough or even one sentence definition of what racism is. Instead, racism was only associated with the term “racial bias,” indicating that the reporters, the police officials, and elected officials (who were mostly White) did not interpret carding or street checks in Hamilton as macroaggressions or systemic racism in Hamilton, and likely confused this issue as one that has more to do with the personal “biases” of the police officers that conducted street checks. This was an early discovery in the research that supported the idea that the discourse around race and racism in the media’s coverage of carding or street checks was informed by an individualistic understanding racism.
Below are examples from the analysis of the common ways racism and anything related to racialization or race were raised or discussed: 1. “While there are ‘ample examples’ of racial bias involving carding, police should still have the power to stop people for questioning when warranted” (Brennan & Ferguson, 2015). 2. “Carding, street safety checks and the links to racial bias” (Dreschel, 2015). 3. “Chief De Caire acknowledged there is racism in policing, but stressed his officers do not systematically target minorities in their street stops” (Hayes, 2015).
This representation of racism is overly simplistic. The articles covering carding did not give its readers any basic conception of carding that could be used as a foundation for understanding where and how carding fits within a larger sociohistorical picture of institutional racism in the city and why that has broader implications that affects everyone who lives in the city. Since the articles did not provide or cite any clear definition of racism or its historical relevance in Hamilton, these articles were lacking references to any ongoing systemic context or to any major part of the foundation for antiracist arguments against carding. To put it another way, these articles were both inadvertently and carelessly erasing a history of institutional racism against Blacks, Indigenous peoples, and Other marginalized peoples, as well as their organized struggles and resistance. By erasing this history, these articles effectively erased the foundation upon which all of the critical arguments against carding are built on. Therefore, when these arguments are presented in the local news media outlets, the arguments against carding carry less weight and are often presented as questionable, made to seem fallacious to readers and as though they have no sociohistorical knowledge of tenuous race relations in Hamilton.
In their book, Racial Formation in the United States, Omi and Winant identify what is known as “race” as a largely sociohistorical concept that is “an unstable and decentered complex of social meanings constantly being transformed by political struggle” (Omi & Winant, 2008, p. 19). Omi and Winant’s point behind examining race as a decentered and unstable complex is to demonstrate that there is not one single definition to race. Instead, the multiple definitions of race, whether they are based on a social concept such as the one drop rule or a biological concept based on skin the differentiations of intelligence among races, is that the different concepts were not exclusive but are likely intertwined together through history and a convergence of political and cultural projects over time. Joseph (2015b) notes that “an attention to confluence focuses on the common practices and technologies within these systems across temporal periods to reveal relations and operations of power and their common project” (p. 16). This emphasis on confluence (as opposed to an intersectional or an interlocking analysis) is to acknowledge that an idea is never static and can be explored through multiple perspectives that are not mutually exclusive (Joseph, 2015b, p. 17). This point reminds us that race cannot be seen as a fixed idea, and it certainly cannot be seen as an idea that is exclusive to its present time. Rather, one must develop a more complex understanding of race by understanding the economic, political, cultural, social, and historical influences that have shaped different meanings or constitutions of race. The intention behind this examination is not to find out the one “true” meaning of a particular idea of what racism is but rather to get a broader, more complex idea of how racism is formed over time and understand that the complexity and messiness of race is as much a challenge of critical race studies, as it is a revelation that relates to gray area that concepts like racism realistically play out in real-life scenarios. Although there is no singular definition of what racism is, Omi and Winant show that racism can still be broadly defined on an institutional level in regard to how a group is systemically oppressed and how another group benefits from this oppression.
Overview of Gaslighting
Gaslighting is a form of psychological abuse. According to Roberts and Andrews, gaslighting is a form of psychological abuse that gets aggravated through reinforcement. The abuser will manipulate the victim’s mental state or physical environment, and then deflect the change to the victim, making the victim think that they are imagining things. By continually doing this, the abuser will gradually develop a relationship with the victim where the abuser can maintain a highly controlling and abusive position of authority while the victim will continually second guess their judgments (Roberts & Andrews, 2013, p. 70).
The term gaslighting has been said to arise in popular use after the 1944 film, Gaslight (Abramson, 2014). During this film, a character, Gregory, manipulates his spouse, Paula, with the aim to have her hospitalized so he can have access to her jewels for the purpose of attaining a substantial fortune (Abramson, 2014). The coinage of the term gaslighting is popular because it references a reoccurring theme in the film: Every time Gregory turns on the attic gaslight to search for jewels there, the other lights in the house start to dim. Once Paula notices this and questions the dimming effect of the gaslights, Gregory dismisses this effect and plays it off by stating that Paula is just imagining things, as this imagination is part of her declining mental health (Abramson, 2014).
There are five main components of the gaslighting process. The first component is the gaslighter. The gaslighter is a person or group who manipulates reality because he or she can benefit from this act (Roberts & Andrews, 2013, p. 78). The second component is the gaslightee. The gaslightee is the person/persons whose reality/lived experiences are manipulated and distorted by the gaslighter (Roberts & Andrews, 2013, p. 78). Usually, the gaslightee represents either figuratively or literally a reward for the gaslighter (Roberts & Andrews, 2013, p. 78). The third component is the object of manipulation. The object of manipulation is usually the persons or objects that the gaslighter manipulates to distort and alter the gaslightee’s memory (Roberts & Andrews, 2013, p. 78). The fourth component of gaslighting is the consequence(s) experienced by the gaslightee. The consequence(s) experienced by the gaslightee are detrimental and can impact them financially, socially, mentally, physically, and emotionally (Roberts & Andrews, 2013, p. 78). The fifth component of gaslighting is the reward(s) for the gaslighter. The reward(s) for the gaslighter can be described through two parts: the results of the gaslighter’s actions and the advantage that the gaslighter receives over the gaslightee as a result of the gaslighting (Roberts & Andrews, 2013, p. 78). Roberts and Andrews states that the primary goal of gaslighting is “the acquisition of a benefit through the intentional distortion of facts, objects, people, etc. The objects of manipulation are inconsequential casualties of the gaslighting project, and only serve the purposes of hiding the gaslighter’s guilt and providing them with some form of advancement or gain acquired from the gaslightee” (Roberts & Andrews, 2013, p. 78). The objects of manipulation are primarily a means to an end (Roberts & Andrews, 2013, p. 79). A subsequent product of gaslighting is invalidation and the lived experience of feeling that one’s perceived disconnect with reality is evidence of their incapacity or lack. This participates in an ongoing project of dehumanization, historically connected to tropes of madness and incivility.
Abramson (2014) notes that during the 1980s, the term gaslighting became popular in therapeutic uses and clinical psychology. Although gaslighting does involve manipulation, Abramson (2014) does note that gaslighting does not have to start out with an end goal in mind. Instead, “those who engage in this form of emotional manipulation are often not consciously trying to drive their targets crazy” (Abramson, 2014). This is an important distinction because it indicates that a person or group of people can enter into an abusive cycle without a “master plan” or clear end in sight. Gass and Nichols notes this as well in their 1988 study on how spouses use gaslighting to conceal and deny their extramarital affairs, when they state that an abuser’s original intention is a “moot point” once they have entered a cycle of lying and trying to deceive their target (Gass & Nichols, 1988). The implications behind noting that gaslighting can be done unintentionally is that a person or a group can enter into abusive behavior without noticing it, suggesting that this predilection to such abusive behavior is often a result of habit or deeply held beliefs and ideologies.
During the process of gaslighting, the reliance on a plausible deniability claim can be used as a form of object manipulation. In particular, plausible deniability claims are used for the manipulation of discourses through deceitful tactics. Walton (1996) describes plausible deniability as a technique of veiled attack (p. 47). The goal of a plausible deniability claim is to use major informal fallacies to actually work as credible tactics of deception in everyday argumentation (Walton, 1996, p. 47). Plausible deniability will usually begin with someone making an ad hominem argument. This type of argument will usually make a fallacious suggestion about something; however, the person making the argument will never make an outright assertion, since an assertion requires a burden of proof (Walton, 1996, p. 49). Instead, the argument will either rely on a presumption or an assumption to avoid the burden of proof. Walton describes this strategy of not making a declarative assertion to avoid the burden of proof as “leaving the back door open”: “plausible deniability is preserved by ambiguity, and other deceptive or confusing techniques that enable the arguer to keep the back door open, should one’s argument be directly confronted or challenged” (Walton, 1996, p. 50). For example, if person A makes an insinuating statement to person B, by stating “You can tell the cops about what you know about the mob, but it’s a dangerous city,” then person B could reasonably interpret the suggestion as a threat on his life since the implication is that if he tells the cops about what he knows about the mob, then the “dangerous city” could result in his harm. However, if person B accuses person A of threatening him, then he could always use the backdoor by stating that he was just stating the facts about the city and did not ever directly make a threat. This is just one example of how plausible deniability works, but it is a strong and persuasive technique that is often successful in escaping accountabilities to a burden of proof when a fallacious argument is directly challenged.
It is important to note that gaslighting is an important concept because it gives a label to a particular kind of psychological abuse. Giving a label to a psychologically abusive term such as gaslighting is important because it can assist targets and victims identify and protect themselves from further or future abuse by the gaslighter. Since one of the major elements to gaslighting is manipulation and the concealment of the intent to manipulate, if the gaslightee(s) is made aware of the gaslighting occurring or that has occurred then the group or the person becomes empowered to be better able to recognize the specific characteristics of what gaslighting looks like via their experience and name it as such. Therefore, when the gaslighter tries to gaslight the gaslightee, instead of making the gaslightee feel “insane” or “unstable” by the virtue of psychological abuse, the gaslightee will have the chance to disrupt the illusion by pointing out how the gaslighter is trying to manipulate the situation. This point reminds us that one of the major keys to pulling of a successful strategy of gaslighting is to make it look like the gaslighting is actually not going on and convincingly make these accusations appear to be a figment of the gaslightee’s imagination.
Findings or Analysis of Data
Shadowing the primary research question, how the discourse in the media around street checks or carding was portrayed as a macroaggression indicating larger institutional or systemic racism in the HPS. Using CDA, the 27 articles were analyzed, annotating them with devoted analytical influence from CRT. The findings are presented in four general themes within the discourse on carding, particularly how the police and the government shaped the discourse and how racialized and marginalized members of the city respond to the discourse in the media: (1) How the discourse around carding or street checks is (re)constructed or constituted. (2) The discourse pertaining to the legality of street checks or carding. (3) Arguments made in support of carding and its regulations. (4) Arguments against carding. While observing these major themes and the marginal journal notes made from each article, it was noticed that the police’s stance on carding kept shifting and changing, making these patterns consistent with gaslighting.
How the discourse around carding or street checks is (re)constructed or constituted
Common within the media’s coverage of carding in Hamilton, the HPS’s definition of carding has been constantly shifted and changed. In the earlier media documents, street checks and carding were seen as separate but possibly related practices. Andrew Dreschel of the Hamilton Spectator stated that “carding, street safety checks, and [….] links to racial bias” were related (Dreschel, 2015). Yet, although the possible association between carding and street checks was contemplated, the police never stated in the media that carding was the same practice as street checks. Instead, at this time, carding was seen as a controversial police tactic that was practiced by the Toronto police (Brennan & Ferguson, 2016). By the time the street checks in the Hamilton became an important, more widely covered issue by local news media outlets, carding was also being covered nationally by news media outlets as both a controversial police practice that was consistent with the definition of racial profiling and a practice that was a violation of human charter rights (Brennan & Ferguson, 2016). Although carding was condemned in Toronto, it was not exactly clear what carding was as a police practice. Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne confirmed the ambiguous understanding of the practice when she stated, “the government needs to consult to nail down ‘definitions around carding’ because ‘we use this word as though everybody understands exactly what it is and what it means”’ (Brennan & Ferguson, 2016). Wynne’s statement indicated that one of the larger problems surrounding carding was the fact that both the Toronto and Hamilton police did not give any clear definition of what the practice of carding was. The definition of carding is central to establishing the tone of the media discourse on carding. Without a clear definition of what carding is in the media’s coverage of carding in Hamilton, the police are less accountable and argumentatively have the “back door” left open since no one can hold them to a strict definition of what carding is. This back door allows the police to be ambiguous in the media. Although the media suspects that street checks and carding are in violation of the Canadian Charter of Human Right and Freedoms (Sections 8, 9, and 15[1] regarding unreasonable search and seizure, arbitrary detention and discrimination based on race, respectively), the lack of a concrete definition of street checks prevents the HPS from being implicated in systemic racism early on in the beginning of the media coverage and the establishment of the discourse on carding.
In addition to the HPS denying that they take any part in carding, the HPS via the media made a concerted effort to distinguish their practice of street checks from the Toronto police service’s practice of carding. Glenn De Caire, the Hamilton police chief at the time and current director of security and parking services at McMaster University stated that “we do not card. We do not participate in random, indiscriminate stopping of persons based on race or any other prohibited ground for the purpose of identifying individuals” (Lennie, 2015c). De Caire’s use of the word “random and indiscriminate” is key because it makes his statement appear to mean that the HPS may stop people based on race; however, these stops are not random and are not without a legitimate reason. Instead, the HPS stated that the reason why they conduct street checks is for the purpose of “building contacts and fostering community relations [….] although community members and legal experts argue that [street checks] amounts to the same thing [as carding]” (Dreschel, 2015). Even if the HPS’s distinction of carding and street checks is based on the fact that the HPS only conducts street checks when they have a legitimate reason, this argument begs the important question of whether this statement is reflection of practice or a technique of gaslighting to foster a favorable view of HPS in the public eye.
The HPS initially denied that they do in fact “card” people and positioned that if the HPS did practice anything that resembled carding then it would be for a legitimate reason. However, as the media coverage around carding progressed, the HPS began to contradict themselves when discussing who would be accountable for street checks or carding. When asked to define street checks, Glenn De Caire stated that there are multiple definitions of street checks and “it depends on who does the talking” (Lennie, 2015a). If the nature of street checks is to stop people and collect information from them because of a possible link to an investigation, then there would be a need for them to give a just and probable cause. By general definition, the practice of carding and street checks gives no legitimate reason to stop people and is instead hinged on a remote possibility that the stopped person may be related to a criminal investigation. In hindsight, it is now appreciated that carding and street checks are the exact same practice and that the HPS was deliberatively being ambiguous—that is, leaving the “back door open”—to avoid negative publicity. The discursive maneuvering by HPS with respect to the definitions of carding appears to be innocent of deliberate avoidance or reinstatement of ambiguity.
The discourse pertaining to the legality of street checks or carding
The second major theme of the Hamiltonian media’s coverage of carding in Hamilton is the focus on the debate of the legality of street checks or carding in Hamilton. Initially, based on the knowledge that the practices of carding were conducted for no legitimate reason and that carding possibly—this is before it was confirmed—that it collected race-based statistics and possibly stopped people for the reason of race, legal experts believed that carding was illegal for two reasons. Critics have stated that carding violates two fundamental charter rights: The right not to be arbitrarily detained.“The right not to be subjected to unreasonable search and seizure” (Brennan & Ferguson, 2016).
The violation of the first right suggests that carding would be illegal if it led to someone being detained for no reason. This means that carding would have to have no investigative purpose other than randomly detaining someone. The violation of the second right suggests that carding would be illegal if the search or seizure of the person(s) being carding did not have to do with any reason other than the fact that they are being carded. Thus, in both these rights, there is no precise interpretation of how carding would be in violation of these laws; instead, the general relation to carding and its violation of those two charter rights would largely depend on the case law—which would not be as helpful since not only are carding and street checks technically a new practice—but it would also depend on the judge or tribunal that is enforcing these rights (Elliot, 2015).
De Caire mentions that police officers can be exercising different laws when conducting carding “but the usage of the term is dependent on the authority an officer is exercising” (Lennie, 2015a). De Caire’s word choice makes carding appear to be practiced in a number of varying ways. Carding may not be one single form of a police practice but instead a tactic that is deployed when necessary for a variety of legitimate forms of police stops. This dilution of an emphasis on carding as a problematic practice suggests a high level of uncertainty and improbability regarding what carding actually is and how the police use it. De Caire expresses his uncertainty with what carding exactly is when he stated in a September 15, 2015, article in the Stoney Creek News: “right now we don’t have the proper definitions, we don’t have common expectations so let’s deal with that” (Werner, 2015).
The Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services (at the time), Yasir Naqvi, stated that “people stopped for no reason are free to walk away” (Brennan & Ferguson, 2016), suggesting that if someone is arbitrarily stopped, and given no reason to be detained, then the police officer should be legally obliged to leave them alone. However, Jeff Manishen, a criminal lawyer based in Hamilton, stated that it is not that simple for a person to walk away from a police officer even if the police officer has no reasonable grounds to stop the person. If people walk way, Manishen notes, police officers may misinterpret or mischaracterize these actions as being hostile to the police and unwilling to help them do their job (Dreschel, 2015). In fact, Manishen states that case law is full of incidents where officers would escalate these scenarios by putting the person under investigative detention (Dreschel, 2015). Normally, when the officers face a judge in the court of law and state the reason why the detainee was put under investigative detention, judges tend to be lenient with what reason the officers give (Dreschel, 2015).
In one instance, De Caire mentions that “an officer may ask for a citizen’s identity when issuing a provincial offence notice. Failing to identify oneself to an officer can obstruct an investigation” (Lennie, 2015a). This quote comes from an article released on June 26, 2015, discussing how the HPS board called on De Caire to give a better definition of street checks. In the context of the general public not knowing the full legal ramifications of carding, this statement also cautions people to be more hesitant toward walking away from any type of police stop, therefore, making it more likely for a person to comply with a street check even if there are no reasonable grounds for the stop.
After the HPS released a report stating that they do track race-based statistics when conducting carding, the provincial government held province-wide meetings in different cities. Although the province did not officially hold a meeting in Hamilton, Matthew Green hosted a town hall meeting that discussed carding (OpHardt, 2015). During this meeting, community members were able to voice their dissatisfaction with the practice of carding by HPS. Minister Naqvi was in attendance. After this meeting—along with the meetings in the other cities in Ontario—it was clear that there was a strong public opinion against the practice of carding by police (Werner, 2015). Therefore, Minister Naqvi announced on behalf of the government that the government would be conducting a province-wide review of carding and how to properly regulate it (Werner, 2015). This review eventually led to province-wide regulations on carding that provide clear and consistent guidelines for police officers.
Before the province-wide regulations on carding were released, it was announced on September 25, 2015, in the Hamilton Community News that the HPS would be adopting five principles on the regulations of carding in Hamilton. These principles were a temporary measure to regulate carding in the city while the HPS waited for the Provincial government’s regulations to come out. These fives principles were taken from the Toronto Police Service, when they also established principles for carding in the city (Lennie, 2015b). The five principles adopted by the HPS were agreed by the Hamilton Police Board at a September 24, 2015, meeting (Lennie, 2015b). The principles were (1) minimize the potential negative effects of contacts in the community; (2) reflect the goal of police legitimacy by ensuring contacts are conducted in the spirit of building trust with the community and are directed toward effective policing; (3) ensure compliance with the Charter generally and, in particular, Section 9: protection against arbitrary detention and Section 15: right to equal treatment under the law; (4) ensure compliance with the code generally, and in particular, Section 1: freedom from discrimination based on race, place of origin, age, color, ethnic origin, gender identity, or gender expression; and (5) ensure compliance with the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act generally, and in particular, with Part 2: protection of individual privacy (Lennie, 2015b). These five principles are presented to the public to basically ensure that the police are abiding by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Ontario Human Rights Code and the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (Lennie, 2015b).
The legal discussion in the media around carding is important because the law—that is, case law and the charter—is really the one major authority that the HPS is accountable to. As seen in this analysis, the legality around carding is very ambiguous; only the two charter rights and the five principles were used to determine if the HPS were breaking the law when they conducted street checks. However, since the definition of street checks was so ambiguous, the HPS left “the back door” open and was able to avoid being held accountable to a reasonable burden of proof. The HPS’s manipulation of the law is part of a larger sociohistorical process of gaslighting where government officials and the police manipulate the law to avoid being held accountable for potentially illegal actions. The sociohistorical aspect of gaslighting will be discussed in the last section of this article.
Arguments in favor of street checks and its regulation
After the HPS’s practices of carding or street checks became better understood to the general public through public discussion, a series of arguments in support of carding or street checks were made in the media. The first being the argument that carding or street checks are essential to police work, especially when conducting investigative work. In the media, this argument is depicted as being one that is based off actual police experience. In one article, Michael Csoke (2015), a former officer of the Toronto Police, explained his experience with carding as a police officer: My first experience of successful “carding” was when I was a young Toronto police officer. I had stopped a car full of known criminals and “carded” their association. About a year later, I received information that my card had linked two individuals together in a homicide. Prior to my card discovery, these two individuals had denied any knowledge of one another to investigators. That, was “carding” at its best, and what it is truly intended for. Linking criminals and criminality together, nothing more. There is no underlying purpose for race gathering as the writer would have the public believe. Here, Csoke presents carding as a canny, tactical police practice that outwits criminals. The experience he talks about presents carding as an essential tool in a chess like game of cat and mouse between police officers and criminals. When Csoke states that carding is meant for linking criminals and criminality together and nothing more, he is implying that carding is simply an objective tactic that only has to do with police officers and criminals, denying that anyone who is an innocent bystander and citizen is ever affected by carding. His statement that there is “no underlying purpose for race gathering as the writer would have the public believe” implies that the writer is fabricating the claim that carding is part of a larger sociohistorical process of police discrimination against people of color and poorer people. Csoke further tries to diminish the arguments against carding by deeming it unrealistic. In the same Spectator article where he states that carding is not race based, he also states that the proposed regulations for carding are unrealistic: The writer also suggests that police service boards implement a policy where officers initiate an interaction with a citizen and let them know that they are under no obligation to speak to them, and then issue a receipt to them afterward. I can picture the scenario now. With the recent spat of shootings in this city, as officers attempt to link the shooters together through surveillance and the use of “contact cards,” card which would provide vital information in order to link associations, vehicles, and locations together, but as officers approach a car load of suspects, they have to ask their permission to converse? This writer obviously resides in the penthouse of his ivory tower. (Csoke, 2015) Here, Csoke attempts to diminish the argument against carding by depicting the HPS as only relying on carding when it comes to criminal investigations and dealing with potential criminals. His statement makes the proposed regulations for carding look like its giving criminals the upper hand when it comes to the cat and mouse chess game that law enforcement and criminals play. Csoke completely ignores the fact that regular, noncriminal, citizens have consistently complained about carding affecting them to the extent of traumatization. Csoke ignores that people of color who have had experiences with carding and other forms of racial profiling have any legitimacy when it comes to talking about carding and the legality behind it. He also puts police work above human rights considerations as though police data collection should be above human rights protections.
Not only have the police and elected representatives denied the voices of people of color and poorer people when it comes to talking about the experiences with carding and racial profiling, they have also denied that racism is a systematic issue in Hamilton despite the evidence showing that carding disproportionately targets Blacks, Indigenous Americans, and poor people. After the race-based statistics were released in July, 2015, Lloyd Ferguson, the chair of the HPS board said, “I feel better now, that it’s not 80% people of color, because that would be a problem” (Leitner, 2015). Ferguson avoids recognition of systemic racism by resetting the threshold of what should be considered disproportionate with his 80% rule. What Ferguson distracts from is that while 3.2% of the city’s population is Black, Blacks made up 12% of those who were carded, indicating that Blacks are being carded at a significant disproportionally high rate (Leitner, 2015). Ferguson seems to be insisting that the voices of Blacks and other marginalized communities can be suppressed and erased simply for the fact that he sees them as marginal. Ferguson underscores his unsympathetic approach to the representation of people of color and other marginalized groups in Hamilton by stating that “Personally, I like street checks and I’ve heard from my community; they like it too” (Leitner, 2015). Ferguson, the representative of Ward 12 (Ancaster), is speaking on behalf of a predominantly White, affluent neighborhood. In this case, Ferguson demonstrates that a large amount of city councilors and elected representatives in Hamilton—with the lone exception being councilor Matthew Green (the first person of color to be elected to a seat on Hamilton city council)—are denying the racism of carding partly due to their own privileged subjectivities that are disconnected from the lived experiences of those whom carding seems to impact the most.
The racism of carding is not only belittled in the local media analyzed as a small problem, but it is also premised as a problem related to individual biases and (thus isolated) personal problems and not a systematic problem embedded within institutional policies and law. De Caire demonstrates his misuse of the word racism when he states that his officers “do not activate any of their policing authorities based on race” (OpHardt, 2015), indicating that the HPS officers are never trained to stop someone solely based on their race. However, he does “[acknowledge] there is racism in policing, but his officers do not systematically target minorities in their street stops—and that such stops are necessary to gather information and solve crimes” (Hayes, 2015). De Caire clearly does not appear to appreciate what racism is beyond an individual bias. He instead makes a distinction between racism as a personal issue and systemic racism as an institutional issue. Unfortunately, what De Caire does not understand is that the former of these two distinctions is part of the latter (the larger system of racism). To this effect, not only is he presenting a distorted image of what racism actually is, but he seems to deny culpability for his officers’ actions and scapegoat them as the perpetuators of racial bias despite his own police report indicating that the HPS does systemically target people of color with no evidence to support the legitimacy of how these police stops apply to reasonable, evidence-based investigations and crime prevention. It is worth noting that in a 2011 study done by Wortley and Owusu-Bempah (2011), they found that “black racial background appears to be a master status that attracts attention and significantly contributes to police decisions to conduct street interrogations. To the police, young black males represent the usual suspects” (p. 402). This study reminds us that criminality cannot be separated from racialization. Actually, racialization is deeply connected to criminality historically, as notions of criminality were once believed to be hereditary traits bound to immigrants not from a desirable stock of British citizens (Joseph, 2015a). An essential component of racialization—that is, judging someone based of their appearance—is currently a regular form of policing. When De Caire argues that policing is separate from systemic racism, he is discounting two important points. Firstly, part of the stereotype of being Black is also being a potential criminal and vice versa. Secondly, as documented as early as 1915, when immigration services collaborated with the Ontario provincial police to deport people of color without the due process of the law, the police have historically attached race to criminality and used these ideologies of criminality to justify racial profiling (Joseph, 2015a). Lyn Lofland has raised and discussed the establishment of order based on appearance in urban cities in the 1973 book, A World of Strangers: Order and Action in Urban Public Space. Loftland notes that social ordering was historically based on two principles to organize the urban populace. Organizing people based on appearance which is referred to as “appearential ordering” (beginning in preindustrial societies and ordering people by space (spatial ordering—which continued through industrialized cities; Lofland, 1973, p. 29). Lofland’s kind of analyses that suggest using appearance to order people is simply easier for urbanization processes that lack attention to race and racism specifically and the violence of enforcement.
The HPS, via the media, also discursively associates the argument that carding is practical and essential to police work to the idea that this work makes the community safe and if it is discontinued, then it may put the community in danger or at risk. When discussing the importance of street checks and the tension it has caused in the community, De Caire states that “I think it is important that we recognize that there is a fundamental tension between crime prevention and the gathering of criminal intelligence for the purpose of law enforcement and keeping all our communities safe” (Lennie, 2015b). De Caire’s statement suggests that there is tension between crime prevention and the actual processes that go into crime prevention. This statement seems to be deliberately ambiguous and contradictory because if crime prevention and the processes that actually prevent crime are presented as being tenuous in relation to one another—instead of naturally being in conjunction with one another. This clever statement implies that the police are the experts of keeping the city safe and implies that the communities’ discomfort is a necessary cost of the provision of safety. In addition to this belittling and denying or erasing the voices of the marginalized that are oppressed by carding, the HPS has tried to diminish the voices of elected representatives and other public servants who have been critics of carding. The HPS has tried to diminish the voices of elected officials and public servants by implying that their opinions are not substantial and just a game of “politics” that has more to do with the internal culture of politicians trying to gain their own benefit than actually benefit the community they serve.
In a Spectator article that covers the province-wide dissent about carding the police association of Ontario was worried that “the value of police check procedures as depicted in the media will become a casualty of politics” (Brennan & Ferguson, 2016). The term “casualty of politics” is ambiguous and dismissive. By claiming that politics may tarnish the true practical value that carding offers to the community, the police association is implying that the negative depiction of carding in the media is being sensationalized or exaggerated and therefore, not an accurate reflection of carding as a practice. Again, this claim does contain a piece of factual information: The media coverage and the negative publicity surrounding carding have certainly played a major role in pressuring both the HPS and the provincial government to do something about carding. However, it also serves to discredit the claims of systemic racism advanced by community members. After the province-wide regulations for carding were released at the beginning of 2016 (scheduled to take effect January 1, 2017), carding was banned throughout the province. In the media, the HPS attempted to distance themselves from the practice and deny that carding was even an official police practice that was standardized throughout its police force.
Inspector Mike Worster, who leads the community mobilization division that includes the ACTION team, indicated his disdain for carding when the Spectator reports that “Though the new regulations specifically prevent police from implementing carding as a performance measure, Worster told the Spectator that had never been a policy in Hamilton, and that the new regulations would not impact the efficiency of the ACTION Team” (OpHardt, 2016b). Worster’s insistence that carding has never been a policy implies that carding was never officially implemented by a document stating that carding was a standard practice in the HPS. This discursively shifts to portray carding to be an informal practice and an error committed by some police and diminishes that actual evidence that was released by the HPS indicated that carding was a serious, systemic, regularly practiced problem in the police service.
The arguments made in support of carding follow a distinctive pattern congruent with that of gaslighting. Carding is argued as a practical, essential, objective, and fair practice to protecting the community, although there is not substantial evidence to suggest that carding is effective. This is ironic, because although there are no detailed statistics or research to demonstrate or support the positive effect that carding has had in the Hamilton community, as the Csoke letter demonstrated, a major argument in support of carding is that the arguments against carding are unrealistic and impractical. The arguments for carding seriously undermine the concept of racism to the extent that it is advanced by police via media as only a simplistic, individual-level issue. Whether or not this misuse is deliberate or based on ignorance is difficult to discern. But this aspect of the argument for carding seriously undermines the voices of people of color who have experienced racism through carding.
Arguments against carding and its regulation
During the media’s coverage of carding in Hamilton that was analyzed, community members argued for the complete abolishment of carding. Ismael Traore, cofounder of Black, Brown, Red Lives Matter of Hamilton, stated that the town hall meeting held in on September 15, 2015, was a statement to “show all the other communities in Ontario that Hamilton is for the total abolition of carding” (OpHardt, 2015). At the town hall meeting, Brother Staferd X, a Black minister from Toronto, shared sentiments similar to Traore’s when he said that when it comes to carding, “people are tired of injustice and they’re tired of being treated as second-class citizens” (Buist, 2015), indicating the disenfranchisement that victims of carding feel.
One major argument against carding that was depicted in the media was that carding racially criminalizes the downtown core of Hamilton. It was noted by police officials that carding is done in “high priority areas” such as the downtown core (Craven, 2016). In this area, the percentage of Blacks, Indigenous Americans, and Other people of color is higher than the citywide average (Sayani-Mulji, 2015). However, Riaz Sayani-Mulji (2015), a law student at the University of Toronto and a person of color, states that this narrative perpetuates the criminalization of race and follows “the racist myth that high priority areas possess criminality.” Sayani-Mulji’s point is important because it demonstrates that one of the major narratives that is being told to convince people that carding is beneficial to the community is actually a false narrative that tries to insinuate that carding as an investigative and crime prevention tactic will naturally take place in areas where people of color, LGBTQ people, and other marginalized people reside. An example of how carding operates as a policy that criminalizes people of color came in De Caire’s September 21, 2015, letter to Yasir Naqvi when he stated that: When we send officers to this area in response to the shooting, we are going to be stopping, talking and investigating young black males. We are going to be stopping and talking to as many people as possible because we do not know who might be a suspect, person of interest, victim, witness or a person who may wish to be a confidential informant. We don’t know until we gather the information. Anyone who happens to be a “young black male” is going to be stopped, without evidence of wrongdoing, without even a suspicion of wrongdoing; they are to be stopped and questioned and information about them added to a police database solely because they are young Black males. (Goba, 2015) De Caire made this remark in reference to a shooting that occurred between two Black males right outside the downtown core on May 2015. Ruth Goba, the interim chief commissioner of the Ontario Human Rights Commission at the time, condemned this statement made by De Caire as evidence that this form of carding is a form of racial profiling: “Chief De Caire outlines what he apparently feels is a suitable discretionary approach to collecting information […] This is a textbook description of racial profiling. It is not discretion in action—it is a racially-motivated round-up” (Goba, 2015). Goba’s letter in response to De Caire is a great indicator that if unchecked, the HPS will try to rationalize racial profiling by claiming that race based stops are coincidental because the ones who possess criminality happen to be Black.
The need for a stronger system of checks and balances that will hold the HPS accountable is further underscored after carding was regulated instead of being abolished by the provincial government. Elliot (2015b) of the Hamilton Spectator notes how police officers could exploit the loopholes of the regulations: “Let’s face it, if police are motivated to doing a stop, coming up with a legitimate investigative reason is easy.” Elliot reminds us that preventing the police from conducting arbitrary stops, the major reason why carding was regulated, is easier said than done as officers’ perceptions of what is arbitrary and what is not arbitrary can always be altered. The regulation of carding does not ensure the practice will cease. There needs to be a systemic shift in the internal culture of the HPS that will implement “checks and balances to ensure its benefits remain useful, while its potential harm is minimized” (Elliot, 2015b). The need for checks and balances to ensure that the carding regulations are effective indicates that the regulations need to be routinely and systematically enforced.
The arguments against carding and its regulation in Hamilton reveal that the concerns of victims of carding were either ignored or indirectly dealt with by the provincial government and the HPS. Recalling that gaslighting, as a form of psychological abuse, manipulates an object to the disadvantage of the gaslightee for the benefit of the gaslighter, we can see that although people from marginalized communities clearly reported that they wanted street checks to be fully abolished, the HPS was able to maintain the practice of street checks. Through a series of racial myths involving criminality and low socioeconomic status, the HPS via the media was not only able to discredit the voices of carding victims, but these myths also implied that their victimization may even be their own fault.
Discussion: Gaslighting, a Historical Form of Psychological Abuse That Perpetuates Systemic Racism
Gaslighting, as highlighted in this article, enacts a deeply hurtful, historical form of psychological abuse that perpetuates systemic racism. During the early 1900s in Ontario, it has been uncovered that the Canadian Immigration Department and the Provincial police were profiling people coming across the border from the United States and sending them back for no legitimate reason that was in accordance with the law. In 1915, W. D. Scott (the Superintendent of Immigration at the time) investigated the deportation of 1,135 “hobos, tramps, undesirable aliens” from November 1913 to October 1914 (Joseph, 2015a, p. 137). When conducting that investigation, Scott was concerned about the legitimacy of these deportations (Joseph, 2015a, p. 137). Initially, when he contacted officials from Sarnia, Ottawa, Windsor, Bridgeburg, and Niagara Falls, they stated that they did not have any records of handing people over to the police for deportation (Joseph, 2015a, p. 137). Instead, the superintendent of the provincial police at the time stated to Scott in a letter that the immigration officials were not guilty of negligence (Joseph, 2015a, p. 137). The provincial police superintendent stated that the provincial police and immigration officials were working together to prevent “largely American hoboes, the proportion of Europeans being small…on freight trains at night in small boats, and through the bush” (Joseph, 2015a, p. 137). In this letter, the police superintendent makes it appear that the police and the immigration officials were righteous and legally stopping “undesirables” from illegally crossing the border. However, Scott, not satisfied with the ambiguity of this response, later finds out from the superintendent of the provincial police that “Inspector Mains came to the conclusion that it was no use filling the country’s gaols with these men, and putting the Province to the cost of their maintenance. For the protection of the Province, Inspector Mains devised a scheme to rid this element” (Joseph, 2015a, p. 139). In this letter, it is also revealed that the plan involved “finding and handing over undesirables to immigration officials” (Joseph, 2015a, p. 139). Joseph states that the letters documenting W. D. Scott’s communication with the provincial police and immigrations officials reveal to us that (1) The criminal justice system contrived a scheme outside of the provisions of the law to protect the province from undesirables. (2) The lack of documentation and record keeping allowed the police to identify and deport people without inquiry as to how and why they did so. (3) The lack of records and documents erases how and why the practice of racial profiling practice while allowing the police to continue the illegal deportation of people. (4) The lack of records and documents about this police practice simultaneously erases the “identities, voices, faces, protections […] for the wellbeing of those described as hobos, tramps or undesirables” from consideration (Joseph, 2015a, p. 139). (5) “The conversation is confined to possible gaps in border surveillance” as opposed to focusing on how the police and the immigration officials abused their authority under the Immigration Act by using the police to deport people without giving them “justice through due process” (Joseph, 2015a, pp. 137–139).
In terms of gaslighting, Joseph’s analysis indicates that police and the immigration officials used a form of gaslighting to make it appear that their policing practices represented “a fair and just process to any who would inquire” (Joseph, 2015a, p. 141). In this case, the people that were deported and anyone else, including Scott, who were affected by the police and the immigration officials’ false image of legal deportation are the victims of this process and therefore, the gaslightees. The objects of manipulation are the records or the lack of records; as Joseph noted, this object is key for the police and the officials to deny any wrong doing while also maintaining the illusion that their practice is both legal and important to the protection of the province’s safety. The reward for the gaslighter appears to be: “ensuring that Canada remains composed of people most resembling a white, able (in body and mind), English-speaking British Canadian settler/worker” (Joseph, 2015a, pp. 139, 140). The consequence for the gaslightee is twofold: First, by restricting the records that are kept, anyone, like Scott, that is trying to properly enforce the law cannot do so and a result, the ability to properly enforce the law is impeded; second, by the law not being properly enforced and systematically impeded, marginalized people are systematically profiled and deported without no legitimate legal basis. This historical case as an example that demonstrates that the Ontario police and Canadian government officials have used gaslighting to conceal and reframe historical processes of racial profiling.
Throughout the media discourse of street checks or carding in Hamilton, the gaslighters are the HPS and other elected officials who made arguments in support of carding. The main object of manipulation during this gaslighting process was the police’s position on carding via news media articles. By changing their stance on carding, the police were able to reframe the issue of carding in the city and control the discourse in the media to the extent where the voices of the marginalized were suppressed and ignored. This is seen in the beginning of the media’s coverage of carding or street checks in Hamilton when it was clear that large majority of the community were against carding and wanted the practice to be completely banned, citing its violations of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms among other reasons against the practice. In response to these initial arguments made on behalf of the racialized and marginalized groups in the city, De Caire explicitly stated that the HPS does not practice carding—they instead practice street checks as a form of investigative police work that is devoted to crime prevention while building community relations within the city. Yet, despite the broad purpose given for what street checks accomplish, neither De Caire—nor did any representative on behalf of the HPS—give an explicit definition of street checks for accountability. In terms of plausible deniability, the HPS left a backdoor open. The HPS can escape accountability and the requirements of the burden of proof because they avoided stating a clear definition of carding, leaving it up for general interpretation.
While the HPS clearly distinguishes the practice of carding—a police tactic that is notoriously known as a method of racial profiling in Toronto—from what they claim is their practice of street checks they also deny that the HPS conducts police stops on the basis of race. However, when the HPS released the full report on their practice of street checks, it was clear that this practice was nearly identical to what was understood of as a practice of carding based on racial profiling. Once the similarities between the two practices were noted, the HPS changed their stance from not practicing carding to not practicing arbitrary stops or discriminatory stops on the basis of race. This move was critical for the HPS because they were now stating that the practice of carding itself was not necessarily wrong, it was the practice of using carding as a method to stop someone with no legitimate basis that was wrong. Of course, as noted before, this is a logical collapse. The practice of carding is already with no legitimate basis, especially when considering the fact that the report did not give any evidence for how carding has directly contributed to the prevention or reduction of crime. Nevertheless, the HPS was able to reframe the discourse around street checks: Initially, the issue was that this practice was seen as structurally discriminate toward visible minorities, but now this practice was being portrayed as vulnerable to an individual officer’s personal bias.
De Caire made sure to note this when he openly stated to the media that he did not have a precise definition of street checks and that an officer’s interpretation of street checks was subject to who was doing the talking. After, the Ontario Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services decided to regulate street checks as opposed to completely ban it—the measure that opponents to carding initially demanded, the HPS gaslighted racialized and marginalized groups who were completely against the practice of carding by making it appear that the police were always against the arbitrary and discriminatory nature of street checks (even though this stance by the police was not developed until late 2015 as a measure to avoid being implicated as a structurally racist institution). Also notable is how the HPS shaped the discourse surrounding why carding is an issue; the HPS, through this analysis, never directly responded to the arguments against carding. Instead, they indirectly dealt with these arguments by changing their stance to look like they had the same opinion as the community. Of course, the result shows that the most pressing arguments against carding were largely ignored, which demonstrates that the HPS manipulated the media discourse around carding to create the illusion that they were interested in the voices of the marginalized when they were really not.
Former Harvard Law Professor, Derrick Bell Jr., created a theory called interest convergence to explain how important civil rights breakthroughs happen because the minorities’ interests were able to align with the government’s interests. Bell (1980) notes that during any crucial breakthrough in the America Civil Rights movement, particularly the 1954 Brown versus the Board of Education of Topeka case, “the interest of Blacks in achieving racial equality will be accommodated only when it converges with the interests of Whites” (p. 523). Bell made this statement because he noticed that before this case, similar cases fighting segregation continually lost, although the same arguments were being made against discrimination. Therefore, although the country philosophically believed in freedom for everyone, practically, the government did not apply this philosophy to every demographic in the country, especially if implementing equality to African Americans threatened their political power. Bell (1980) states that his theory was not to diminish the advancements made by the Brown case nor was it to undermine the advancements made by civil rights activists that helped win the case (p. 525). Rather, his goal was to remind people that interest convergence shows that it was unlikely the government would help civil rights activists just off of a moral imperative (Bell, 1980, p. 525). Instead, there must also be a strong practical, socioeconomic imperative to help advance the civil rights movement, especially in the overtly racist environment of the American South.
What is equally important as understanding what happens when interests converge is understanding what happens when interests diverge. An example of interest divergence happened after the Brown Case. After the Brown case, many civil rights activists were ecstatic because the victory marked a possible sign that the government would back their movement. However, immediately after the case was decided, many White people in the south, especially working-class and lower class White people, were insulted by the case’s decision because they perceived it as a threat to their perceived advantages they enjoyed because of segregation (Bell, 1980, p. 526). With this growing sentiment among working-class Whites and in general, Whites in the south, government officials—both elected and not elected—began to view supporting the civil rights movement as a risk to their political power (Bell, 1980, p. 526). Since the government did not want to risk angering their political supporters, they started to slowly withdraw their support for cases that would desegregate the south, specifically in the area of education (Bell, 1980, p. 526). As a result, the courts began to cling to the concept of “local autonomy” as a “vital national tradition” (Bell, 1980, p. 526) when making decisions about desegregation policies. As Bell described, “it was not enough that segregation was the ‘natural and foreseeable’ consequence of [racist] policies. And even when this difficult standard of proof is met, courts must carefully limit the relief granted to the harm actually proved” (Bell, 1980, p. 526). The burden of proof that the courts put on the plaintiffs is reminiscent of the constant expectation that people require from minorities to demonstrate the occurrence physical harm or overtly racist language to prove that racism actually exists. And this is dangerous because it discredits harder to measure but equally important damages of racism done to minorities such as trauma and depression. Not only does the unreasonably high standard of the burden of proof act as a practical tactic to create obstacles for civil rights activists, but it also creates trauma because the demand for material proof of racism diminishes the lived reality of Blacks. The debate about racism no longer becomes safe for Black people. Their reality is questioned, thus questioning their sanity.
An example of the question of minorities’ sanity came in early 2016, when Matthew Green, the first Black city councilor in the city of Hamilton, was arbitrarily stopped by a police while waiting for a bus. In a letter of complaint to the HPS, Green stated that he was arbitrarily stopped at an underpass near a bus stop, trying to avoid the wind (Van Dogen, 2016). While waiting for the bus, he was stopped by a police officer who began to ask Green invasive question for no reason. Green reflects on the encounter, stating “He repeatedly questioned my credibility, acting in an intimidating manner and continued to harass me even though it was clear I was not a suspect in any crime nor involved in criminal activity” (Van Dogen, 2016). Members of the HPS tried to discredit and use explicit techniques of gaslighting to discredit the picture that Green’s account paints of the HPS’s relation to racial profiling. Clint Twolan, president of the Hamilton Police Association, questioned Green’s account by insinuating that the officers instead did a condition check (Van Dongen, 2016). Twolan states, “if that’s the case, rather than being critical, it’s my opinion Mr. Green should be thanking the officers for coming and checking on him” (Van Dongen, 2016). Twolan’s rhetoric is classic gaslighting: As the gaslighter, he is trying to manipulate Green’s own first-hand account of what happened by insinuating that he may have misinterpreted the event. Twolan tries to question Green’s memory and subtly assert the belief that police know more about these encounters. By trying to convince Green that he does not know what he is feeling and that he should instead thank the same officer that appeared to racially profile him, Twoland is patronizing Green and trying to undermine his own psychological ability to judge what was a clear example of racial profiling.
A major reason why the HPS used gaslighting techniques in their statements in the media is possibly because it would not be in their best as an institution to acknowledge that it was practicing an overtly racist practice. In order to understand this point, it is imperative to understand the HPS’ subculture surrounding allegations of racial profiling. The HPS has a subculture that influences them to interpret racial profiling as a smaller part of criminal profiling. Therefore, if they happen to profile minorities, then they believe that they would be profiling them not because of their racial characteristics but because they matched the description and qualities of a criminal profile. When Satzewich and Shaffir interviewed Hamilton Police Officers for this study, one officer stated that if he was working in the Jane-Finch Area in Toronto, an area that is known for its crime and has a high population of Black people, he would stop people who committed crimes (Satzewich & Shaffir, 2009, p. 209). If the people he stops happens to be Black, then he would not be stopping them for their race as much as he would be stopping them because they were likely to commit a crime (Satzewich & Shaffir, 2009, p. 209). The officer that was interviewed compares this way of thinking about catching criminals to how fisherman go to catch fish: “You go where the first are if you’re going to catch fish. If you’re going to catch criminals, you end up having to do that” (Satzewich & Shaffir, 2009, p. 209).
One other major deflection technique that the HPS uses to neutralize allegations of racism is to state that they are no longer racist. They achieve this deflection technique by comparing their current, diverse police force to their past, less diverse and tolerant police force to show how far they have come and to justify that racism is not that big of an issue today as it was in the past (Satzewich & Shaffir, 2009, p. 215). Another deflection technique is to state that because Canada is an evolving multicultural society, things are getting better. The younger, the more diverse, and the more educated the police force gets, the more tolerant and understanding the service gets as a whole. This allows them to take issues of racism more seriously and have a rigorous recruiting process that allows them to screen individuals and “weed out” the “bad apples” that demonstrate behaviors of racism and intolerance (Satzewich & Shaffir, 2009, p. 215).
The justification that racial profiling is incidental and circumstantial to the broader practice of criminal profiling may be partly true. But it is not a justification nor a valid reason for why minorities should be subject to racial profiling. A major point that Satzewich and Shaffir illuminate about the difference between the HPS’s subcultural perspective on racism and a CRT understanding of racism is that “racism is about consequences, independent of motive” (Satzewich & Shaffir, 2009, p. 220). However, the police seem to understand racism through the lens of motive, which allows them to distinguish racial profiling from criminal profiling (Satzewich & Shaffir, 2009, p. 220). From their perspective, racism has not been perpetuated if the officer is not racist. In this case, the officer was just looking for criminals. There are two problems with this approach. First, idea of what a “criminal” looks like is based on a racial stereotype (Wortley & Owusu-Bempah, 2011, p. 402). Therefore, if the police are using the idea of “what a criminal looks like” to find criminals, they are more likely to target minorities because this demographic is more likely to fit the description of what a criminal looks like. Second, in regard to carding, there is no evidence-based study to demonstrate that carding is effective and has led to the reduction of crime. So regardless of motive, the police are using an unproven method of patrolling that has damaged their trust and relationship with not only minorities in the city but the society in general.
It should also be noted that between 2010 and 2014, it is reported that 270,000 street checks were conducted by the ACTION team (Buist, 2015). However, the official report only accounts for 9,000 street checks, which is just 30% of the actual amount of street checks that were done over that 5-year period. Similar to when the provincial police and immigration officials were able to avoid being implicated in the illegal deportation of people back to the United States because of the lack of records documenting how and why these deportations were conducted, the lack of records for carding impedes racialized and marginalized groups’ opposition to street checks while helping the HPS avoid being implicated in a much larger scandal. This gaslighting has psychological and emotionally traumatized, racialized, and marginalized victims of carding by further disenfranchising them from the community while damaging their confidence in HPS’s ability to both listen to and then deal with the community’s concerns about issues of systemic racism. This criminalization is not only frustrating and harmful in the short term, but it is also psychologically and emotionally traumatic.
Conclusion
The issue of carding or street checks is a macroaggression that is indicative of a larger system of racism in Hamilton. Over time, gaslighting emotionally and psychologically exhausts racialized and marginalized groups of the city when they realize that their voices are not being heard or taken seriously. Evelyn Myrie expressed this feeling when she told Minister Naqvi, at the September 2015 town hall meeting that “we are tired of giving you our voices and then the system fails us” (Buist, 2015). The goal of this study was to show that despite police officials and government officials appearing to listen to the concerns of its marginalized and racialized community members, behind the scenes, these public servants rely upon a form of psychological abuse known as gaslighting to get what would benefit their institution while undercutting and ignoring the voices of the socially marginalized groups of the city. Carding or street checks is a macroaggression and a sociohistorical problem of institutional racism in Hamilton. The media discourse on racism has been simplistic, making racism appear to be an individual problem instead of a sociohistorical problem avoiding any discussion of systemic or structural issues such as White supremacy or White privilege. As the voices of racialized and marginalized members of the city note, street checks or carding is a symptom of a much larger problem in the city that will continue to resurface whether it is not dealt with through a systemic analysis of racism.
While gaslighting is psychologically abusive and does perpetuate sociohistorical structures of racism, gaslighting can only be fully effective when gaslightee is unaware of the process—this is how the gaslighter is able to manipulate the objects and avoid detection. When the veil of gaslighting is removed, the gaslightee can not only learn these deceitful tactics, but the gaslightee can also hold the gaslighter to the burden of proof that the process of gaslighting desperately tries to avoid. Without hindsight, it is easy to see how the HPS controlled the media discourse on carding. With hindsight, this manipulation can be identified. Empowering and resourcing people to name and identify the reenactment of historical form of racialized systemic violence is yet another act of resistance that can engage us all in our own projects of liberation and challenge the dehumanization and violence of White supremacy.

Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1107, I call up the resolution (H. Res. 908) condemning all forms of anti-Asian sentiment as related to COVID-19, and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Tlaib). Pursuant to House Resolution1107, the resolution is considered read. The text of the resolution is as follows: H. Res. 908 Whereas 23,000,000 Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders account for 7 percent of the Nation's population in the United States; Whereas over 2,000,000 Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are working on the frontlines of this COVID-19 pandemic in health care, law enforcement, first responders, transportation, supermarkets, and other service industries; Whereas the use of anti-Asian terminology and rhetoric related to COVID-19, such as the ``Chinese Virus'', ``Wuhan Virus'', and ``Kung-flu'' have perpetuated anti-Asian stigma; Whereas since January 2020, there has been a dramatic increase in reports of hate crimes and incidents against those of Asian descent; Whereas according to a recent study, there were over 400 cases related to COVID-19 anti-Asian discrimination between February 9, 2020, and March 7, 2020; Whereas the increased use of anti-Asian rhetoric has resulted in Asian Americans being harassed, assaulted, and scapegoated for the COVID-19 pandemic; Whereas in March 2020, anti-Asian violence includes: a woman wearing a mask was kicked and punched at a New York City subway station; two children and two adults were stabbed at a wholesale grocery in Midland, Texas; a couple was assaulted and robbed by a group of attackers in Philadelphia; and a 16-year-old boy was sent to the hospital after being attacked by bullies in Los Angeles, California; Whereas the increased use of anti-Asian rhetoric has also resulted in Asian-American businesses being targeted for vandalism; Whereas there are approximately 2 million Asian American- owned businesses that generate over $700 billion in annual revenue and employ nearly 4.5 million workers; Whereas the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recognize that naming COVID-19 by its geographic location or linking it to a specific ethnicity perpetuates stigma; Whereas in 2015, the WHO issued guidance calling on media outlets, scientists, and national authorities to avoid naming infectious diseases for locations to avoid stigmatizing groups of people; Whereas, on February 27, 2020, the Secretary of Health and Human Services stated ``ethnicity is not what causes the novel coronavirus'' and that it is inappropriate and inaccurate to call COVID-19 the ``Chinese virus''; Whereas, on February 28, 2020, Dr. Mitch Wolfe, the Chief Medical Officer of the CDC said, ``Stigma is the enemy of public health''; Whereas, on March 10, 2020, Dr. Robert Redfield, the Director of the CDC, testified that use of the term ``Chinese coronavirus'' is wrong and inappropriate; and Whereas the Secretary General of the United Nations called for international solidarity and an end to any ill-founded discrimination of the outbreak's victims: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives-- (1) calls on all public officials to condemn and denounce any and all anti-Asian sentiment in any form; (2) recognizes that the health and safety of all Americans, no matter their background, must be of utmost priority; (3) condemns all manifestations of expressions of racism, xenophobia, discrimination, anti-Asian sentiment, scapegoating, and ethnic or religious intolerance; (4) calls on Federal law enforcement officials, working with State and local officials-- (A) to expeditiously investigate and document all credible reports of hate crimes and incidents and threats against the Asian-American community in the United States; (B) to collect data to document the rise of incidences of hate crimes due to COVID-19; and (C) to hold the perpetrators of those crimes, incidents, or threats accountable and bring such perpetrators to justice; and (5) recommits United States leadership in building more inclusive, diverse, and tolerant societies-- (A) to prioritize language access and inclusivity in communication practices; and (B) to combat misinformation and discrimination that put Asian Americans at risk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The resolution shall be debatable for 1 hour, equally divided and controlled by the [[Page H4496]] chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary. The gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler) and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Jordan) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. General Leave Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H. Res. 908. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 908, a resolution condemning all forms of anti-Asian sentiment as related to COVID-19. Among other things, the resolution, introduced by my colleague from New York, Representative Grace Meng, calls upon all public officials to condemn and denounce anti-Asian sentiment, and it calls on Federal law enforcement officials to investigate and document all credible reports of hate crimes against Asian Americans, to collect data on the rise of hate crimes incidents due to COVID-19, and to hold perpetrators accountable. The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing crisis for our country. Over 6.6 million Americans have been infected, and almost 200,000 have died from COVID-19. It has upended the lives of almost every American in some way, and it will continue to do so for some time as we brace for a potential second wave of infections. On top of bearing the burdens that the pandemic has imposed on all Americans, Asian Americans have been forced to carry the added anxiety of confronting racial prejudice, including racially motivated harassment and violence stemming from the stigma that has unfairly associated them with COVID-19 because of the virus' origin in China, a stigma that has been reinforced by rhetoric suggesting such a link. According to the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, since March 19, there have been almost 2,600 cases of anti-Asian discrimination related to COVID-19. According to the resolution, at the pandemic's earliest stage in this country, between February 9 and March 7, there were over 400 such incidents. These include the stabbings of an Asian-American father and two young children, ages 2 and 6, in Texas. Public health entities, including the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have recognized that labeling a virus by geographic or ethnic terms unfairly stigmatizes certain communities and ultimately harms public health. For this reason, Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar rightly condemned the use of the phrase ``Chinese virus'' in testimony before the Ways and Means Committee, stating that: ``Ethnicity it is not what causes the novel coronavirus.'' It is incumbent on all public figures, including elected officials like us, to publicly condemn bigotry and the stigmatization of racial or ethnic groups unfairly targeted for blame. We must speak out clearly against such attitudes and acts of hate whenever they occur, but particularly in the face of public panic or fear during a national emergency, when society can be especially vulnerable to racist appeals and prejudices. While many public figures have admirably sought to end COVID-19- related animosity, some, unfortunately, appear not to share the same sense of moral duty. Rather than using their bully pulpits to confront prejudice and racial hatred, they have instead chosen repeatedly to use derogatory and prejudicial phrases and remarks, reinforcing the exclusion and stigmatization of Asian Americans in the face of a national crisis, a tactic that sadly has a long and ugly history in our country. Left unchecked, this type of rhetoric has, in the past, led to grave injustices like the Chinese Exclusion Act and the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. In the year 2020, condemning bigotry and racial scapegoating should not be hard for any Member of this House to do. It is long past time to leave the days of yellow peril hysteria and unjustified blame of the other behind. The House can take an important step in that direction by passing H.Res. 908 unanimously. I urge strong support for this resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, we oppose this legislation. Everyone knows racism is wrong, but that is not what this legislation is about. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins). Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam Speaker, let's be clear. There is no denying where the virus originated. It was China. There is no denying the Chinese Communist Party has done everything in its power to cover up their role in the ongoing pandemic, intentionally misleading the global community and forcing their friends in the World Health Organization to do their bidding. That being said, how is that Democrats are still refusing to acknowledge China's role in the coronavirus pandemic? Just recently, a Chinese virologist acknowledged that the coronavirus was released from a Chinese lab in Wuhan. Are we just to pretend that didn't exist or is not even a possibility? It seems like the route the Democrats would like us to take is to pretend that the Communists in China absolutely played no role in the global pandemic and blame it all on the President. To be clear, Madam Speaker, all forms of racism and discrimination are abhorrent, including anti-Asian sentiment. If that is what we were talking about today, that would be even better. But this is not what we are talking about today. The underlying tone, even from the chairman, is discussing how we deal with this in words. I have stood on this floor several times over the past year-and-a-half in denouncing all forms of hatred on both sides. But let's be honest. That is not what this bill is really about. This bill is exactly what this entire Congress has been about the entire time: Democrats ignoring the real issues plaguing Americans, just for the opportunity to criticize President Trump. Despite their overwhelming failure to undermine the Trump administration through the Russian collusion hoax and the sham impeachment, the Democratic playbook has not changed at all. Now, a little over 6 weeks from the election, Democrats are leaning on the global crisis to continue their admonitions, all at the expense of American families and businesses desperate for relief. Democrats have taken no issue in ignoring the coronavirus' effects on the ground in favor of criticizing the President, and no criticism is more dynamic than their collective offense at President Trump calling the virus the ``China virus'' or the ``Wuhan virus.'' Democrats would love for the American people to forget the work that the administration has done to tackle the virus, including shutting down travel for China in the early days of the virus. Instead of applauding the move, Democrats and Joe Biden accused the Trump administration and President Trump of fanning the flames of hate, fear, and xenophobia, when his actual actions kept others from getting it and kept it from spreading because it was coming from China. For the last 3 years, Democrats have repeatedly claimed that Russia must have something on Donald Trump. The real question is, frankly, during a presidential election, what does the Chinese Communist Party have on Joe Biden? Democrats would also love for the American people to forget that many viruses are named for where they originated. Take the Spanish flu, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Ebola, and German measles. Because the Democrats seem to be so bankrupt on this floor of bringing bills and real solutions forward, maybe the next 2 weeks we are up here, we are going to have one on the German measles and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. That is all we are doing, wasting the people's time with this right here. If you want to work on politics, go outside the Capitol, not here on the floor of this House. [[Page H4497]] President Trump and Republicans have made it clear where the blame of this virus begins. It begins and ends with the Chinese Communist Party and their refusal to acknowledge the problem they had and let it go into all the world. Refusing to acknowledge that fact is wrong, and failing to address it in the House, in favor of political messaging bills like this, is nothing more than political attempts to take down this President. Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline). Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, last March, as the COVID-19 pandemic first began to affect our day-to-day lives, the FBI warned that we could soon see a rise in hate crimes committed against Asian Americans. In this moment, President Trump could have tried to bring Americans together. That is not the path he chose. Instead, the President has poured gasoline on the fire, using terms like ``kung flu'' and ``China virus.'' The White House has stoked racial tensions and fed into our country's worst xenophobic impulses. From March until June of this year, our country saw more than 2,100 reported hate crimes targeting Asian Americans. More than 3 in 10 Asian Americans now say that they have been the subject of slurs or racist jokes since the start of this pandemic. These slurs and jokes aren't just words. They are actions designed to make Asian Americans feel less than equal, and they have no place in this country. But that is the reality of life in Donald Trump's America. This administration has tried to turn back the clock on racial equality. This administration has demeaned, belittled, and ostracized nearly every minority community. Today, the House is saying no more. We will not stand by as this administration attacks innocent men, women, and children of Asian descent. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this excellent resolution. {time} 0930 Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Posey). Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, I was hopeful that this resolution would lead us to common ground. None of us here believes in discriminating against our fellow Asian-American neighbors. On March 23, President Trump said the Asian-American community ought to be ``totally protected'' in light of the xenophobic attacks during the coronavirus pandemic. ``It is very important that we totally protect our Asian-American community in the United States and all around the world,'' President Trump tweeted. ``They're amazing people, and the spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way, shape, or form,'' he said. ``They're working closely with us to get rid of it,'' the President added. ``We will prevail together.'' I have restauranteurs in my district who suffered from bullies because of their heritage, so I asked my staff to prepare a resolution to echo the President's sentiments. My staff reported to me that such a resolution already existed, H. Res. 908, ostensibly to protect Asian Americans. On April 7, I signed onto what I considered to be a good faith effort to protect Asian Americans. I am more than saddened to see that this resolution and today's debate is being used for nothing more than to malign and vilify the President of the United States, just as the President and congressional Republicans have been called domestic enemies in the last couple of days. I would hope for more, but, sadly, this body has chosen to take the low road. This debate has devolved into finger-pointing, name-calling, and scoring political points. Rather than reaching a high watermark for bringing us all together, it has further ripped apart the fabric of America. I am deeply disappointed and will not be a party to today's partisan exercise that is more about scoring political points than rebuilding America. We should be working together to help all Americans recover, to investigate COVID-19, which has resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths around the world, trillions lost and trillions more spent responding to COVID. Lives and dreams have been shattered. We have a duty to all Americans to find a cure, to get to the bottom of just how this pandemic started, and to do what we can to prevent it from happening ever again in the future. Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Krishnamoorthi). Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker, today I rise in support of H. Res.908, condemning all forms of anti-Asian sentiment related to COVID-19. Since this pandemic began, there have been thousands and thousands of reports of discrimination and xenophobic attacks against Asian Americans in the United States, including in my district, which has one of the highest concentrations of Asian Americans in the country. As an Asian American myself, this is deeply personal and offensive to me. When people, including those in the White House, refer to COVID-19 as the Chinese virus or the kung-flu, they encourage bigotry or discrimination against Asian Americans. To put it simply, promoting anti-Asian-American sentiment or anti- Asian sentiment as related to COVID-19 is un-American, which is why I am proud to cosponsor this resolution and encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, again, we all know racism is wrong, but that is not what this is about. This is just another effort of the Democrats to attack the President. The third whereas in the resolution, the gentlemen just spoke about this. The third whereas in the resolution says you perpetuate anti- Asian bias if you use the terms ``Chinese virus'' or ``Wuhan virus.'' Well, someone should have told the media this. CNN called it the Wuhan virus. MSNBC called it the Chinese coronavirus. ABC and CBS called it China's coronavirus. CNBC called it the China coronavirus. So someone should have told the media that you couldn't use these terms. Frankly, someone should have told the Democrats a few months ago that a few months later the mob, the cancel culture, would say this is a term you can't use, because the Democrats used it on their committee notice. In the January 29, 2020, committee notice, House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation, Congressman Barrett, the chairman, says in the subject line of the hearing for the following week: ``Subject: The Wuhan coronavirus.'' Someone should have told the Democrats you can't use that term, but in the new woke world you can't state the truth. And as Mr. Collins pointed out: Did the virus start in China? Yes. Did the virus start in Wuhan, China? Yes. Did China lie to the United States about the severity and the origins of this virus? Yes. Did China lie to the world about the virus? Yes, they did. Did the World Health Organization lie to the United States? Yes, they did. Did the World Health Organization lie to the rest of the world? The answer to every single one of those questions is yes. But you can't say that, not in this world, not in the politically correct cancel culture. You can't state the truth. You can't state that the Chinese Government launched a disinformation campaign to cover up its role in exacerbating the spread of COVID-19. You can't say the coverup included punishing doctors, limiting the access of journalists, censoring the internet, spreading disinformation, and withholding information from the entire international community. You can't say that. You can't say a Chinese Government official publicly and falsely claimed that the United States Army brought it to Wuhan, the Chinese Government failed to institute a full-scale public response, and underreporting of COVID-19 cases and deaths propelled the virus on the course that it has been on. You can't say all that. You could a few months ago. You could have a few months ago, but you can't today. That is the cancel culture world. That is how the mob operates today. You used to be able to say, as Mr. Collins pointed out, the West Nile virus, the Zika virus, German measles, Spanish flu. Not today. Not today. They will attack you if you don't say it [[Page H4498]] the way they want you to say it, and this is dangerous. You can't say China virus today, and tomorrow who knows what it will be. But, like I said, a few months ago, even the Democrat committee chairman used the very term that is in their resolution they are saying you can't use today because somehow it is anti-Asian bias. I think it has more to do with the fact that we are 7 weeks before an election, and this is one more way to go after the President. But we should all remember, this is dangerous when you start saying certain things can't be said. If you don't say it the way we, the politically correct, the cancel culture mob wants you to say it, you have to be quiet. Silence is the biggest threat to the First Amendment, and that is what we are seeing. And they want to just say--this is broader, this is bigger. I would say look at the sports world. Look at the sports world. Drew Brees says you should stand for the national anthem; he gets attacked. Mike Gundy, football coach at Oklahoma State, goes fishing with his kids and wears what the mob says is the wrong T-shirt; he almost loses his job. He wore a T-shirt that had a conservative news outlet on the T-shirt. Oh, my goodness. You can't coach football if you wear the wrong T-shirt with your kids, according to the mob. You can't say a term today that just a few months ago they used on their committee notice. You can't say it today because that is what the mob says. James Harden says ``Back the Blue'' on a mask. He has to answer for that. Last week, two high school football players--on 9/11--ran on the field with a Back the Blue flag and a flag supporting our firefighters, and they get suspended because today the mob says that is not okay. We need to understand the cancel culture restricting, limiting, telling you what you can and can't say is so darn dangerous, and it will never stop, because the mob never--it never quits. You don't believe me? Two weeks ago--2 weeks ago--the mayor of this city, our Nation's Capital, has a proposal to remove and relocate the Washington Monument and the Jefferson Memorial. This is how ridiculous--this is how ridiculous it gets. And maybe I will just finish with this. Maybe the most ridiculous thing is the last clause, the last page of their resolution. The last page says: ``recommits United States leadership in building more inclusive, diverse, and tolerant societies . . . to combat misinformation. . . .'' Now, think about this for a second. If you state the truth, the virus started in China, you are a bad guy. You are not allowed to state the truth. This resolution says that is misinformation. The very misinformation that happened was China misinforming the world, lying to the world. You are not allowed to talk about that. You have to do what--this resolution says you have to do it the politically correct, the woke way, the cancel culture way, and that is why this is so darn wrong, so darn wrong. I hope we don't continue to travel down this road. This is scary where the left wants to take the country, so dangerous for the First Amendment and free speech rights. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Kim). Mr. KIM. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this resolution and in strong opposition to the rise of hate crimes and acts of racism toward Americans of Asian descent. We all know that these are divisive times. They are tough times. Hateful language, petty name-calling, and acts of violence are not the way for us to get through these tough times. This resolution allows Congress to come together to speak with one voice, that hate targeted at the Asian-American community has no place in this country and must be condemned. I am especially proud to speak here today with so many of my AAPI colleagues. Many of us have been the victims of these hateful and harmful actions. We have seen firsthand the vitriol of racism. We have felt the sting of the distrustful look or a harsh word. I hope you will join me today in acknowledging the impact of racism and forcefully renouncing it. I hope you will join me here today in calling on unity and calling out division. And I hope you will join me here today in passing a resolution that can remind us that even in the darkest times we are strongest when we reject hate and embrace America's diversity. Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs), the chairman of the Freedom Caucus. Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Madam Speaker, I join in condemning racial discrimination of all kinds. It should never be tolerated. I wish we had the perfect society and everybody recognized everybody in a colorblind way, but what this bill does today is it doesn't address that. When I heard the chairman of the Judiciary Committee just refer to calling the virus that originated in China the Wuhan prefecture, when I heard him say that this is somehow equivalent to the Chinese Immigration Exclusion Act or somehow equivalent to the Japanese internment camp experience that we had where over 100,000 Japanese were removed from their homes and taken to camps, I said: This really is the woke culture on steroids. This has gone beyond. If this would have been a condemnation of anti-Asian discrimination, I probably would have been right there signing this. I lived in northeast Asia for 2 years. I speak Japanese. I have traveled extensively in Asia. This doesn't address that. What it does is says: You know what, we want to do something when we are about 6 weeks out from an election. That is what this resolution is about. You can't tell the truth here. Let's just recite some of the things we know: The West Nile virus, that is because that virus emerged from the West Nile district of Uganda, 1930. The Saint Louis encephalitis virus broke out around St. Louis in 1933. The Japanese encephalitis virus broke out in Japan in 1870. {time} 0945 Coxsackie, New York State; Marburg, Germany; Hendra, Australia, all have viruses named after them. You will always have the ignorant who act out on racial animus. We condemn that. But let's tell the truth. The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome virus in 2012. We call that ``MERS.'' This week we learned from Chinese virologist Dr. Li-Meng Yan that not only did this virus originate in China, but it may have been manufactured and released intentionally by the Chinese Communist Party. So when the media refers to this as the ``Wuhan virus'' or the ``China virus,'' and other officials, including folks from this party over here, it is not because they have an existing racist sentiment, but it is rather to describe its origination as has been done historically. This resolution today is even more than a measure to appease the woke and tolerant and politically correct leftists. It is an attack on President Trump and all who support President Trump. It is a crying shame that you can't take the actual issue that you want to address and address it. You have to expand it that way for political purposes. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.'' Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee). Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and also for his tremendous leadership. And also, I acknowledge Representative Meng for spearheading this important resolution. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 908 to condemn all forms of anti-Asian hate speech related to COVID-19. Now, this pandemic is leading to an alarming rate of hateful speech directed at people of Asian and Pacific Islander descent in the United States. And the truth is, as an African American, I know what hate and racism is and I know the violence that results. And the facts are: Since March, there have been over 2,500 reported cases of anti-Asian discrimination related to COVID-19, including over 1,100 cases in my home State of California. At the same time, by no accident or coincidence, the White House continues to refer to COVID-19 as the [[Page H4499]] ``China virus'' and ``kung flu'' trying to shift attention and blame away from this administration's inadequate response and poor leadership. They would rather scapegoat Asian Americans, exacerbating anti-Asian hate and violence. Congress needs to send a clear message that we will stand with our AAPI community, especially during these challenging times, to fight bigotry and racism within our country. Hate speech does lead to violence and discrimination. That is the truth. Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. Takano). Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to condemn the xenophobic anti-Asian rhetoric that President Trump and his allies have been using to distract us from their woefully inadequate response to COVID-19. By referring to COVID-19 almost exclusively as the ``China virus,'' the President is fueling racism and inspiring violent attacks on Asian Americans and Asian immigrants. Rather than condemning this divisive language and unifying our Nation in response to the pandemic, my Republican colleagues are blindly following suit. This partisanship is so pervasive that Congresswoman Meng's simple resolution condemning this anti-Asian sentiment could not be passed unanimously out of this Chamber. This is a disgrace. A disgrace. The COVID-19 pandemic has become a defining moment in our Nation's history. Instead of unifying to confront this disease head-on, Republicans have instead weaponized this to revive the racist blemishes of the past. Madam Speaker, I urge passage of this resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Kelly of Illinois). Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Was it a disgrace a few months ago when the Democratic chairman called it the `` Wuhan coronavirus,'' or is it just a disgrace now when we are less than 7 weeks before an election and you guys want to continue to attack the President? Which is it? Because it can't be a disgrace just now when you used the exact same language that the Democrat chairman, the Democrat staff used for their subcommittee hearing. So you can get all fired up and start yelling at us, but the truth is you guys used it, the same terms you are now saying, oh, are so bad in this resolution. The hypocrisy from the left and the mob of what you can say today and can't say tomorrow is ridiculous, and the American people see it. They see it. They know this is complete BS. They know it is completely about the election, which is 7 weeks away. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Arrington). Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman, my dear friend from Ohio, for yielding. I am listening to my colleagues and the recent speaker. Where is that passion, where is that indignation over the violent mobs that are terrorizing our communities, that are assaulting our law enforcement officers? People are being killed in cold blood in once great American cities, and not nigh a word is said in this great Chamber about what is happening to our fellow Americans whose rights are being trampled. Instead, they want to hyperventilate over this pettiness. We know what it is about, and the American people know what it is about, Madam Speaker. They know good and well this is about scoring political points. They have seen it over and over, day in and day out for the last 2 years under the Pelosi leadership of this great representative body; obstruction, more political theater, and just dividing us. This is dividing our country. This is opportunism like I have never seen before. You can't refer to a virus by its place of origin? We have been doing that for time immemorial. And now we can't call it the ``Chinese virus,'' somehow that is offensive? This is about dividing our country. This is about stoking the flames of racial dissension. It is un-American. It is unacceptable for our leaders to do what is happening today. I trust the American people; they are watching this. This is the stark contrast in leadership that we have been talking about. Do you want more of this, America? Do you want more resolutions to condemn calling the virus the ``Wuhan virus?'' Or do you want to condemn what is happening in Portland, in Seattle, and the rise in crime and the mass exodus by our police officers, who feel that they have jeopardized their livelihoods and their lives? We have disrespected them. We have demonized them. What are we doing in this Chamber? God save the Union. God have mercy that we can't just come together, solve a few problems, I don't know, like the unprecedented crisis that we are facing to get our fellow American citizens and families back on their feet. To hold China accountable for what they have done. There are real problems to solve, and I want to work with my colleagues. And they know we condemn racism. They know we don't stand for making light of something so serious. But they are seizing on this political opportunistic moment. It is the wrong time. They are on the wrong side of history here, Madam Speaker. And the ultimate judge of what happens today in this Chamber and what has happened over the last 2 years will be in the hands of we the people. And that is my faith, that is my confidence. Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Case). Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, and back to the subject of the resolution on the floor, which is discrimination against any and all Americans on the basis of their race. As the proud Representative of the State and district with the highest percentage of Asian Americans in this country, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 908 to condemn any and all forms of anti- Asian discrimination during and beyond this terrible pandemic. Our country confronts not only the novel coronavirus but also a virus of racism and hate. We cannot allow the one to feed off the other. On behalf of all Americans, we have a moral responsibility to call out and condemn this wave of racist hate speech, harassment, discrimination, and physical violence driven by fear, disinformation, and even purposeful exploitation. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this resolution without reservation and speak out against racism against any group in any form at any time. Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Malinowski). Mr. MALINOWSKI. Madam Speaker, after 9/11, President Bush never once called terrorism a Muslim virus or an Arab virus or a Saudi virus. He made clear that the enemy was not the place where the terrorists came from or the people who lived there, but terrorism itself. He did that because it was right and because he knew that equating the evil of al- Qaida with an entire faith or nationality or country was exactly what our enemies wanted. So today, when prominent people in our country, whether they are Republicans or Democrats, or anybody in the media, encourage Americans to call COVID the ``China virus,'' language that seems to blame this pandemic on a country and a people, they are not only doing something wrong, something that has already encouraged violence and discrimination against Asian Americans, they are playing right into the hands of a Chinese Communist Party that wants Asian Americans to feel unwanted and unsafe in America. Now, if you want to blame this on the Chinese Government, sign me up. If you want to blame them or anybody else for lying to the American people, sign me up. But if you are going to give this virus a nationality, you are doing something wrong. And if you don't see the difference between those two things, then you don't understand what is going on in this country in this moment of division, this moment of danger that we face. Madam Speaker, I am proud to support this resolution condemning anti- [[Page H4500]] Asian rhetoric in any form. I ask my colleagues to vote for it, and I urge them to live up to it. Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. Cisneros). Mr. CISNEROS. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution condemning all forms of anti-Asian sentiment related to COVID-19. The AAPI community in the 39th District has been an integral part of fighting the coronavirus. They are first responders, essential workers, educators, and small business owners. Yet there have been too many stories in my district and across the country of racism, discrimination, and physical and verbal assault towards Asian Americans. I had the opportunity to hear some of these stories during one of my town halls, including the emotional encounter of a constituent from Brea, California. This young woman was unable to pick up her mother's prescription drugs due to racist aggressive remarks she received that were directed towards her. She left, running away in tears. This resolution will assure that cases like hers are justly investigated and receive the attention they deserve. I thank my colleague Representative Meng for her leadership, and I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this resolution to ensure protection, safety, and respect for our AAPI community. Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green). Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding the time. Madam Speaker, on this Constitution Day we will do well to heed the words of Dr. King when he reminded us that the ultimate measure of the person is not where the person stands in times of comfort and convenience, but where do you stand in times of challenge and controversy? Where do you stand when racism and anti-Semitism and anti-Asian sentiments are emanating from the highest office in the land? Where do you stand? {time} 1000 I stand with the business owner who is losing business, and some have gone out of business because of this kind of hateful violence emanating from words. I stand with the mother who has to console her child who comes home from school and who has been bullied. I stand with the child who has been bullied who comes home crying. I stand with the people of my congressional district and across this land who happen to be of Asian ancestry. I stand against racism. It is easy to say: ``I am against racism. I condemn racism.'' But when will you condemn the racist? When will you condemn the racist when it is emanating from the highest office in the land? This is Constitution Day. I close with these words from Emily Dickinson. The truest measure of the person, I have reminded you, but Dickinson reminded us that: ``A word is dead when it is said, some say. I say it just begins to live that day.'' These words live; they take on meanings; they impact people; and they cause harms. It is time for us to take a stand. Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, the import of this resolution could not be more clear. Anti-Asian sentiment will not be tolerated. Anti-Semitism will not be tolerated. Discrimination against anyone will not be tolerated. When language comes consistently from the White House, from other places that stoke anti-Asian sentiment, that stoke racism, this cannot be tolerated. And this House must declare that we will not tolerate it. This House must be on record against the use of language designed to stoke racism, against the use of language designed to pick out a particular ethnic group--in this case Asians, but it is the same as if it picked out a different ethnic group. No ethnic group should be the target of such obloquy, of such racism, of such opposition from the White House. None. It is unconscionable that we have to stand here and oppose the White House stoking anti-Asian sentiment. It is unconscionable that the White House would do such a thing. But if it does such a thing, then it is incumbent on this House to denounce it. It is incumbent on this House to make sure that the American people know that we do not stand with anyone, whether in the White House or anyplace else, who stokes deliberately anti-Asian sentiment. We cannot abide, we must not abide, the use of public office, the use of public facilities, the use of the public microphone to stoke anti- Asian sentiment, no more than we would tolerate it if it were stoking anti-Black sentiment or anti-Semitic sentiment. None of this is tolerable. We must not permit this. So, I say again, it cannot be allowed that, on the floor of this House, we do not denounce the use of public resources, the use of the White House, the use of public resources to stoke anti-Asian sentiment. Mr. JORDAN. Will the gentleman yield for a question? Mr. NADLER. I yield to the gentleman from Ohio for a question. Mr. JORDAN. Was The Washington Post on January 26, 2020, to use your words, stoking anti-Asian bias when they used the word ``Chinese coronavirus''? Was The New York Times on February 20, 2020, stoking anti-Asian bias when they used the term ``Wuhan coronavirus'' in their headline? Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, reclaiming my time. They learned their lesson. They stopped using such terms. They learned their lesson. They understood what this House should understand. They understood that the use of such terms stokes racism, stokes anti-Asian sentiment, and they stopped using the term because they learned the lesson. All we are saying is the White House should learn the same lesson, and they should stop using the term. And for that matter, Members of this House should stop using the term because it deliberately stokes anti-Asian sentiment. The Washington Post learned that lesson and ceased using such terms. The Washington Post learned the lesson. We are not saying that everyone knew this initially, but it is clear. It is now clear. The Washington Post learned its lesson and stopped using such terms. The New York Times learned its lesson when they realized that it was stoking anti-Asian sentiment and stopped using this term. We are saying that the White House and Members of this House and anyone else should learn the same lesson and not stoke anti-Asian sentiment by continuing the use of terms that we know stoke anti-Asian sentiment. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Bera). Mr. BERA. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 908, led by my colleague Representative Grace Meng. I do feel compelled, though, to respond to my colleague on the other side of the aisle, Mr. Jordan. I was that subcommittee chairman. We held the first coronavirus hearing in this new pandemic addressing the issues. Yes, we did identify it by its geographic origin as the Wuhan coronavirus. We also learned that as soon as we started to see instances of racism, violence against Asian Americans, that was a mistake. We stopped using that term. That is what we do as adults. We are not here to instigate racism. We are not here to instigate violence against any ethnic group. What we are here to do is actually defeat this pandemic. In that hearing, what we talked about is it is fine doing a travel ban from a country. That would buy us some time. But we also rightfully identified that that travel ban wasn't going to prevent the virus from coming to the United States. It wasn't going to protect us. We had to get ready. We squandered that time. [[Page H4501]] Look, this is a virus. It doesn't understand a country of origin. It doesn't know whether you are a Democrat or Republican, what religion or God you worship. It is a virus. It is shameful for Members of this body or anyone to continue to use language that potentially incites violence against any of our fellow citizens. That is what this resolution is about. Let's actually learn from that. I don't call it by its geographic origin. It now has a name. At that time, it didn't have a name. It is called SARS-CoV2 or COVID-19. We ought to call it by its name. We should not willfully or intentionally use language that potentially incites violence against any of our fellow citizens, that incites racism. We should be better than that. Let's show the American public that we can actually learn, and let's lead by example. That is what we should be doing in the House of Representatives. Again, we called it by its area of origin because the virus didn't have a name. We have learned from that. We don't do that. And we shouldn't intentionally use terminology that would incite violence against any ethnic group, religious group, or any of our fellow citizens. Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. Madam Speaker, what we should also do is denounce violence, all the violence, we see in our urban areas. The Democrats were given that opportunity just 2 months ago when the Attorney General of the United States asked them: Why won't you speak out against the violence in our cities? Why won't you speak out against what the mob is doing in our cities? Guess what we got from them? We got silence. Let's speak out against the violence we have seen for over 100 days in Portland and so many of our other great cities. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), the minority leader, the leader of our great Conference. Mr. McCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. The gentleman makes a very good point. Are we here condemning two sheriffs from California getting shot while sitting in their car? No. Are we here talking about the innocent lives that are being killed night after night in Chicago or other cities? No. Are we here, in the last hours before this body rushes to the airport to leave, to debate the help that we need for COVID, for those who are unemployed, or the small businesses that are going to continue to lay off somebody or are wondering whether they can survive the next day, or for the schools wondering if they will have the resources they need, or the States? No, we are not doing that. We are not doing any of that. But I will make this one promise to you: If the majority was on the other side, we would have already done that. Madam Speaker, Democrats are neglecting the real issues. Month after month, they have refused to end our dependence on China or even acknowledge that the Chinese Communist Party is a national security threat. I have read it in the paper. We have heard it out in the public domain that the Communist Chinese Party wants to influence the election even. They have picked a side. Now, in January, Democrats were too busy impeaching the President to pay attention to what was happening in Wuhan. There is a common denominator here. Let's just go through the calendar. In January, they were too busy with impeaching. In February, they backed out of what should have been a bipartisan China Task Force. They actually said yes. The Washington Post actually had the article written. The members were already chosen. But the hour came, and the Democrats thought that was wrong. Then, let's move to May. Speaker Pelosi said focusing on China is a diversion. I look forward to hearing what the Speaker says about this resolution. Is that a diversion from solving the COVID relief that we need? In June, Chairman Smith of the Committee on Armed Services on this very floor, just over at that mic, said this about China: It is not actually their job to tell the American people about the coronavirus. Seriously? Those were the words that were spoken by the chair of the Armed Services Committee. In July, Chairman Schiff--remember who he is and what role he has. He is the chairman of the Committee on Intelligence. He said it was an escalation for the Trump administration to close down the Chinese consulate that was, according to the Secretary of State, the hub of spying and IP theft in Houston. He was the only one who thought that. And now, today, while Democrats deny the real threat of Communist China, they are delaying a coronavirus relief package because they despise the President. I heard a Member here, Madam Speaker, who said we are adults, so we think differently. You know what adults do? They give adult supervision, and they focus on things that are important. We only have a few hours left before people leave. I know Madam Speaker told us before August that we will not leave unless we get a COVID relief package. I am not sure if I should believe her then or believe her now, because I know people are going to leave in a few short hours. I know, as the majority, you have the power to schedule what comes to the floor. That was one of my jobs. So this is what they picked? This is what we are doing? Seriously? My question to the Democrats is simple: Is debating a nonbinding resolution the best use of our hour? Apparently, you have made that decision. You thought long and hard long before we came to this moment in time. You spent hours on this. I will promise you this: There is no kitchen in America that thinks this is the priority. What makes today's resolution so harmful is it does not stop discrimination. It simply spreads disinformation. At the heart of this resolution is an absurd notion that referring to the virus as the Wuhan virus or the China virus is the same as contributing to violence against Asian Americans, which I will tell you nobody on this side of the aisle supports. In fact, we have heard time and again--I just heard from my colleague on the other side. The Democrat-led Foreign Affairs Committee held a hearing titled ``The Wuhan Coronavirus'' in February. {time} 1015 Should we put an ethics complaint? Are Democrats saying that their own committee members are encouraging discrimination against Asian Americans? Likewise, CNN, The Washington Post, NPR, The Guardian, all other major media outlets were referring to COVID-19 as the Wuhan coronavirus long before most Americans knew what it was. Now, let's put this in contrast, because you are wasting our time; you are spending hours on it. You think it is the most important thing, when someone is sitting there in the unemployment line or a small business is questioning whether they can stay open. So let's take this moment in time on this floor talking about it. Republicans condemn crime and discrimination in all forms. Listen to what the President said in March: ``spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way, shape, or form.'' But I guess you can't take his word for it, so let's waste another hour on this floor on a nonbinding resolution. Madam Speaker, I wonder--because every Member who comes here works hard to get here, I wonder the number of times Members in a debate said they would take their time to have nonbinding resolutions on the floor. I wonder the number of promises they made. Because I listened, Madam Speaker, to the Speaker up there when I handed her the gavel on what they said they would focus on. I have spent a lot of time trying to wonder what one problem this Democrat majority has solved. I have actually asked Democrats: Name me one that you solved. I haven't read a tweet from probably the most prominent of the new party's chief of staff. They had the same question. They couldn't answer it. [[Page H4502]] The President's words express what every good and decent American has known from the beginning: Asian Americans are not responsible for COVID-19. Let me be very clear. Let me state that again. The President's words express what every good and decent American has known from the beginning: Asian Americans are not responsible for COVID-19. Now, let me tell you everything else every American understands. We have an economic problem. We have people unemployed. We have small businesses questioning whether they can stay open. We have schools that are wondering could they have the money to be able to open again. But you chose an hour of this time on the last day before we leave to debate a nonbinding resolution. Congratulations. Well done. You fought hard for a majority, and this is what you decided. Unfortunately, while Democrats waste an hour of the House's time on this ridiculous resolution, the opportunity costs of the inaction are rising. And do you know who is paying the price? The American people. For months, every reasonable American has understood that America must end our dependency on China; we must move our supply chain out of China for critical needs like medicine. Do you realize we don't make penicillin? We don't make vitamins here, personal protective equipment that we strive so hard to get, and technology. The American people want safety and security. They want to return to the American way of life. I am not sure what this nonbinding resolution does, but I know we have done a lot of them since you have taken the majority. Unfortunately, the Chinese Communist Party is trying to hack our vaccine research at this very moment. That is why I introduced legislation earlier this summer to sanction these cybercriminals. My bill had real consequences. And you know what is so unique? I introduced the bill because there were reports out there that Russia, China, Iran wanted to hack our universities, our businesses to get that vaccine, not to work with us, but to steal it. Do you know what happens when they do that? It slows the process down. Do you know what happens when it slows the process down? It takes longer before people have a safe vaccine that would cure this virus. It is very interesting. That moment on the floor, the day after I introduced it, we actually--the FBI found two Chinese who were doing this, coming into our country, slowing the process down. We had the opportunity to have a motion to recommit on this floor. Nobody in America thought that bill would be partisan. It would only sanction those people who were caught, about right and wrong, about the safety, the security, a safe and effective vaccine being slowed down because of a foreign country coming in. So, as one, we had an opportunity to do something about it. Do you know what happened? The Democrats voted against it and defeated it. Not only did they defeat it, let me tell you, again, what the chairman of the Armed Services Committee said about it. He stood up at that microphone. He literally said it is not actually their job to tell the American people about the virus, referring to China, while they are hacking our own companies working to provide a safe and effective vaccine. You wouldn't spend 1 minute on that, but you are spending an hour on this. Sadly, this is not an isolated incident. Madam Speaker, the majority won't even work with the Republicans to protect our vaccine research from hackers, and they will attack the very companies that are working around the clock to provide that safe and effective vaccine for the American people. They won't work with Republicans to restore American manufacturing to rebuild the American medical supply right here, but they will call the House back into session to debate conspiracy theories about the post office. And while we were here in that emergency meeting--and, Madam Speaker, I should probably talk about it, because there were a lot of Democrats who didn't come even though it was an emergency meeting called by the Speaker. I think it was one-third of all of them did not come. But while we were here, that one moment, the one opportunity that the Republicans had, we offered a motion, a motion to recommit, to put up funding for COVID relief. Once again, the Democrats did the exact same thing. Instead of stopping the hackers from China, what they said no to, instead of giving another COVID relief bill that opportunity--because we were in an emergency, it was the only time we were coming back, even though, Madam Speaker, the Speaker said we would not leave--they voted it down. They voted it down, the only window that we had. They won't even work with Republicans on what was supposed to be a bipartisan China task force, but they wasted an hour on a nonbinding resolution. Is this how you expect to manage the Chamber? Is this why you took the majority, to waste the American people's time? Madam Speaker, it is time for us to stop acting like the House of resolutions and start acting like the House of Representatives. Make no mistake: China aims to displace America as the world's economic superpower. If they succeed, we will have more than viruses to worry about. The stakes are too high for petty partisanship. If we want safety, if we want independence, we know what we have to do. We have to rebuild our economy, bring back our supply chain, protect our vaccine research and, yes, end our dependency on China. Our President is doing that. House Republicans have made a commitment to America to do just that. We have done it time and again, bringing the idea to the floor. Unfortunately, the majority has thought otherwise. Madam Speaker, I make this promise to you: If the sides change, if we have the opportunity and the privilege to determine what comes to this floor, we will not waste America's time in a time of crisis. We will not tell people they will not leave and then let them go. We will not have Members call it an emergency meeting and let them stay home. We believe Congress is essential. We believe the American public expects that. Madam Speaker, we have a COVID crisis. We have an economy crisis. We have a dependency on China that harms us when it comes to our health issues. We have hackers from foreign nations trying to slow a safe and effective vaccine. We have schoolkids that continue to learn from home, not in school. We have veterans who want to be able to pick their own doctors. We have an infrastructure that is crumbling, but a 5-year plan to make a difference. These are all the problems that, if the majority would switch, would be addressed. But no, today, on our last day this week, we will once again have a nonbinding resolution. I hope you fought hard for this majority. I hope you spent a lot of time and a lot of hours deciding what would come to the floor. But if this is what it is, you have fallen well short of what America expects of this Chamber. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to address their remarks to the Chair. Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished Speaker of the House. Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the recognition, but I also thank Mr. Nadler, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for bringing this important statement of our American values to the floor of the House. I thank him and our colleagues from the Senate, Senators Kamala Harris, Tammy Duckworth, and Mazie Hirono, three Asian- American Members of the United States Senate who were so instrumental in advancing this important, as I said, statement of American values. And yes, it is a good use of time for us in the House of Representatives to state our values, to remove all doubt that people in our country are respected, and that we are not using a pandemic to have people--I will go into that in a moment. But let me just say this. Before the distinguished leader spoke, the gentleman on the other side said: Where are you when you are talking about violence, this or that? [[Page H4503]] We are there. We support peaceful demonstrations. We participate in them. They are part of the essence of our democracy. That does not include looting, starting fires, or rioting. They should be prosecuted. That is lawlessness. I am very proud that Joe Biden has presented the clarity of that, making a distinction that I don't think our colleagues quite understand but the American people do. In a poll released today, it said that the American people support congressional Democrats over President Trump in terms of dealing with the issue of crime in our country, for all of their misrepresentation. It is interesting to hear the revisionist history that the distinguished leader put on the floor of this House when he asked us what have we done. It is a very long list, and I will go into some of it. But I want to say to him, when you had the majority and the Presidency, the one thing that you did was pass a tax bill that put $2 trillion of debt onto our children and giving 83 percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent in our country. And yet you resent the fact that we want to invest more money in making it safe for our children to go back to school; more money into crushing the virus, which is what we do in the HEROES Act; and that we want to help our heroes. That is why it is called that. Our State and local employees, our State and local governments that provide services to the American people, our healthcare workers, our first responders, our police and fire, our transportation, our sanitation workers, our food providers, all of those people working make life go on for us; without them, we couldn't. And our teachers, our teachers, our teachers, the custodians of our children for a good part of their day and of their lives. {time} 1030 Yet the disdain that the Republicans have for our heroes is clear because that is the obstacle to our bringing the coronavirus legislation to the floor that is so needed. I hope that we can reach agreement on that. So when they talk about accomplishment, you had a President and you had two Houses of government. What did you do but take care of the top 1 percent to the tune of 83 percent of the bill that would put $2 trillion of debt to our children and their future? In terms of China, I have taken second place to no one in this body in my opposition to China for three decades. Sometimes I take pride in being called the most disliked American in China for my opposition to China; their trade policies which have been a rip-off of the American worker, and have fought them for decades, whether it is stealing our intellectual property, barriers to our products going into China and other violations; trying to stop their proliferation of weapons technologies of mass destruction to rogue countries, and delivery systems to make delivery possible of those weapons; to their human rights policies in Tibet and Hong Kong and now with the Uighurs and, again, all over China. So I have been on it every single day for over 30 years. I need no pontificating from the leader on the other side who seems to have newly arrived at this issue in order to deflect attention from the fact that the Russians are trying to, once again, infiltrate and jeopardize the security of our elections. Whoever interferes with our elections must be dealt with, whatever country it is; but all of a sudden it is all about China and not about Russia. I think the American people should decide who the next President of the United States is, not Vladimir Putin. So we come here today, and I say this about the legislation: We have had four bills that have been overwhelmingly bipartisan on COVID. Our first one on March 4 was testing, testing, testing; and still we do not have a commitment from this administration that we can crush the virus by testing, tracing, treatment, mask wearing, sanitation, ventilation, and separation--still. The solution is as plain as the nose on your face, which should be covered with a mask. Yet the President said he didn't want to cause panic, but he doesn't mind causing panic that will result in some terrible things happening to the Asian-American community in our country. He has brought about great angst as he shines a bright light on the injustices experienced by so many, including the surge of violence and discrimination being experienced by the Asian American/Pacific Islander community. So I thank the Asian Pacific American Caucus Chair, Judy Chu; the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chair, Joaquin Castro; and the Congressional Black Caucus Chair, Karen Bass, for their leadership on this important resolution and this very necessary use of our time to condemn and combat anti-Asian sentiment. Grace Meng has led this drumbeat for justice for a generation. Together with the other leaders she has brought this legislation to the floor, and I salute her. As the resolution states--and we have all seen--at the same time that the coronavirus pandemic has broken out, so too has a disturbing epidemic of hate and discrimination against the AAPI community erupted. You may not have noticed it. You may have tried to ignore it, but it, in fact, exists. According to the Stop AAPI Hate Reporting Center, more than 2,500 recorded incidents of anti-Asian hate have been perpetrated against the AAPI community since March. These include both physical and verbal attacks, commuters spat on, racial slurs lobbed at passersby, community members shunned, store owners having businesses vandalized, and even little children being pushed and shoved, and families insulted in places of business. Many of these incidents represent civil rights violations, and that is a value for us to protect. It is particularly unconscionable that more than 2 million members of the AAPI community are fighting on the front lines against the COVID-19 virus, yet instead of being celebrated as heroes, they are fighting violence and bigotry. In February, during one of my visits to San Francisco's Chinatown-- which I am overwhelmingly proud to represent--I was heartbroken to witness the devastating impact that fear, stigma, and misinformation are continuing to have on its families and businesses. Nearly half of recorded incidents of anti-Asian hate, according to the Stop AAPI Hate Reporting Center, have occurred in California. For many of the bay area who remember the systemic injustices and discrimination perpetrated against generations of Asian Americans, this resurgence is a traumatic reminder of the lingering specter of xenophobia. Sadly, this bigotry is being fueled by some in Washington, D.C --I thought there would be almost unanimous consent to condemn violence against Asian Americans--even from the White House itself, which uses dangerous, false, and offensive terms to describe the coronavirus. The World Health Organization and the CDC, the Centers for Disease Control, have explicitly warned against linking infectious diseases to a specific ethnicity because of the stigmatizing effects which have serious impact on health and defeating the virus. As the CDC chief medical officer said, stigma is the enemy of public health. Anti-AAPI bigotry violates our bedrock American values and undermines our fight against the coronavirus, and it must end. That is why we must do our part to combat hate, and that is why I am proud to support this resolution and am proud to bring it to the floor as an appropriate and excellent statement of values and good use of our time, instead of giving tax breaks to the wealthiest people in our country at the expense of our children and their future. It calls on public officials to condemn and denounce any and all anti-Asian sentiment in any form, and it recognizes that the health and safety of all Americans, no matter their background, must be of the utmost priority. We are none of us safe until all of us are safe. It condemns all manifestations of expressions of racism, xenophobia, discrimination, anti-Asian sentiment, scapegoating, and ethnic or religious intolerance. It calls on Federal law enforcement officials working with State and local officials to investigate and collect data on hate crimes and bring perpetrators to justice. It recommits our leaders to diversity and inclusion, including in our response to COVID-19. [[Page H4504]] This resolution has the support of hundreds of organizations, including from the medical and scientific communities. Now I know science doesn't mean much to you because you are anti- science, but the scientific community, the American College of Physicians, recently wrote a letter of support for this resolution, stating: It is an essential step to support the health and safety of our Nation during a national crisis. Hate crimes directed against individuals based on individuals' race, ethnic origin, ancestry, primary language, cultural background or nationality are a true public health threat. He goes on to say: It is imperative that physicians, and all people, speak out against hate and discrimination, especially during this national crisis caused by COVID-19. At this challenging time, our Nation's focus should be on respecting the dignity of everyone. That should always be the case. We cannot allow prejudice and discrimination to divide us. So let me just close by adding this: we had a tremendous opportunity, as I said, we passed four bills that were overwhelmingly bipartisan. The CARES Act has done some good things for our country. It also gave an enormous, practically $150 billion, tax break to the wealthiest in our country and made it retroactive. What did that have to do with the coronavirus, making a tax break for the wealthy retroactive? They can't pass a bill without doing something at the high end and then worrying when we want to help working class families in our country. Anyway, our counter to that bill was called the Take Responsibility Act. Those two bills came together. We were able to find our common ground, even though we had to swallow some bitter pills in order to help America's working families as well as small businesses in our country. Why does it have to be so hard? Because there is an anti-science attitude in this Congress and in this administration. There is an anti-governance; there is contempt of science; and there is disdain for State and local government which does so much for our country. Don't take it from me. The chairman of the Fed is saying that it recognizes that State and local government are an important part of our economy. Don't take it from me that we cannot open our economy unless we crush this virus. That is exactly what the Fed chairman said yesterday: it is essential to do this. But it takes money, it takes respect for science, and respect for the advice of scientific leaders in our country that has been absent. Instead, they play a blame game. Who pays the price? The Asian-American community in our country. That is why it is essential for us to follow Grace Meng's lead and that of the Hispanic, Asian-Pacific, and Black Caucus leadership today. I thank, again, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee for his leadership in bringing this important legislation to the floor. It is one of many. We have many bills that we have taken up and we will take up next week as we try to work together to find our common ground. One thing that we are working on right now is to keep government open, because while they may have an anti-governance attitude, we know that we have to make our compromises to keep government open. So, Madam Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to use my Speaker's 1 minute to salute the leadership and thank the sponsors of this legislation. You bring luster to the House of Representatives when you enable us to associate ourselves with the great values of our country and to respect the dignity and worth of everyone in our country. It has never been more important than in this time of great crisis in our country. The SPEAKER pro tempore. I want to remind all Members to address their remarks to the Chair. Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, the Speaker of the House said that the Russians are trying to jeopardize the security of our election. So are the Democrats. Democrats are trying to win the election after the election. Democrats in Pennsylvania have filed a lawsuit that says you can fix errors on absentee ballots after the ballot has been returned to the Board of Elections. I don't even know what this means. Can you vote in a race you didn't vote in? Can you change a vote? What does that mean, you can fix errors after you have already submitted the ballot? In Nevada, Democrats passed a law that says you can accept mail-in ballots 3 days after the election, even if the postmark date on the ballot on the envelope can't be distinguished. They are trying to win the election after the election. That is scary. The Speaker said that the White House is using dangerous and offensive language. The premise of the resolution in front of us is language can cause people to take action, and if you use the term ``China virus'' or ``Wuhan virus'', somehow that will lead to bias against Asian-American people; even though they used the terms ``China virus'' and ``Wuhan virus''. Everyone in the mainstream media used it. They used it in the committee hearing notice. Even though all that is there, they now say, oh, if you use those terms it will lead to anti-Asian bias. But they don't talk about the language they use and the left uses, the language the Speaker uses and how that may create an environment that will lead to violence. The Speaker of the House called the President of the United States an enemy of the state and said his supporters in Congress--Republicans--are enemies of the state. They don't talk about that. No. China virus can lead people to take action, but, no, not when the Speaker of the House calls the President of the United States and Republican Members of Congress enemies of the state. Two years ago a Democrat Member of Congress, the chair of a committee said this 2 years ago this summer: If you see somebody in the Trump Cabinet, you create a crowd, you push back on them, you tell them they are not welcome anymore anywhere. She encouraged her constituents to approach people in the Trump administration, harass them, and tell them they are not welcome anymore anywhere. She encouraged direct action. That is far different from using the term ``China virus'' which they used and which they had in a committee notice. {time} 1045 This individual Member of Congress said, ``Go harass people in the Trump Cabinet.'' The Speaker of the House calls Republicans ``enemies of the State.'' And that is all fine by them. But, oh, you say, ``the virus started in Wuhan, China,'' and somehow you are terrible. This is the crazy world the left is in today. The crazy world they are in today. And, again, as said earlier by the gentleman from Texas and by others, I think the American people see right through this baloney, see right through it. This is ridiculous. I hope we get our senses and start--as the Republican minority leader said--I hope we would actually start spending more of our time on issues of more value to the American people. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I thank our distinguished chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, and I thank and applaud the gentlewoman from New York for her outstanding leadership and championing the rights of all Americans. Madam Speaker, from the unwarranted, unwanted allegations of hysterectomies in immigrant women around the Nation in detention centers, to the President of the United States taking to the bully pit to be able to call COVID-19 and the coronavirus the ``China virus,'' we are finding ourselves in the midst of confusion that is hurting the American people--hurting them in two ways: One, over 6 million COVID-19 infections in the United States, and now, predictions of upwards of 250,000 dead. [[Page H4505]] Every one of them we, as Members of the United States Congress, should mourn because families, sadly, are having to bury family members having not seen them in their last days. What good is it to use that word--the ``Wuhan'' virus? That is not the scientific term. And out of that, we have created a hostile situation for our Asian-American friends, for Asian Americans who have been at the front lines fighting on behalf of this Nation. The use of anti-Asian terminology and rhetoric related to COVID-19, such as the Chinese virus, Wuhan virus, kung flu have perpetrated anti- Asian stigma and is reminiscent of dark and shameful chapters in America's past where Asian Americans were labeled as the ``yellow peril'' and interned in relocation camps. Madam Speaker, more than 23 million Asian American and Pacific Islanders account for 7 percent of the Nation's population in the United States, but over 2 million Asian American and Pacific Islanders are working on the front lines of this COVID-19 pandemic in healthcare, law enforcement, first responders, transportation, supermarkets, and other service industries. They feel threatened. For example, in March 2020, an Asian woman wearing a mask was kicked and punched at a New York City subway station by individuals; two children and two adults were stabbed at a wholesale grocery store. This was anti-Asian rhetoric. Finally, let me say, my own constituent, Coco Ma, in Houston, was afraid to go into a grocery store. Madam Speaker, include an article describing her concern. [From houstonchronical.com, Apr. 17, 2020] In Houston's New Normal, a Different Curve Emerges: Outward Racism Toward Asian Americans (By Olivia P. Tallet) Coco Ma knows it's risky to leave her house amid the coronavirus pandemic, as the number of Houston area confirmed cases increases and the peak is yet to come. The Rice University MBA student, however, doesn't even do the occasional run to the supermarket because, for her, the risk comes not only with battling against the virus but also against the vitriol aimed at Asian Americans like her, stereotyped as culprits of the pandemic. ``I have that fear . . . I ask my husband, who is white, to pick up the food we order. I'm afraid to go inside myself,'' said Ma, aware of the scapegoating impacting Chinese Americans and Asians in general who are mistaken as people from China, where the COVID-19 pandemic was first detected. Almost 1,500 hate incidents against Asian American and Pacific Islanders in the U.S have been reported to the STOP AAPI HATE initiative since it began tracking incidents March 19. ``We know that (that) number is only a drop in the bucket. We know that this is really ubiquitous now,'' said lawyer Manjusha Kulkarni, executive director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council and founder of the tracking hate initiative, headquartered in California. Although the tracking isn't well known around the country, it has already received reports of incidents in 46 states, including Texas, said Kulkarni. The majority of the attacks are verbal, but some are also physical. To report incidents Hate and racist incidents against Asian Americans related to the COVID-19 pandemic can be reported to: Hate is Contagious: racismiscontagious.com; Stop AAPI Hate: asianpacificpolicyandplanningcouncil.org/stop-aapi-hate. In West Texas, a man stabbed and cut members of a family from Burma, at a supermarket in Midland on March 14. The father and one of his two small children were severely wounded before a store employee subdued the attacker. The man allegedly said he did it because he thought the family was from China and infecting people with the virus. Local media outlets reported that the FBI is investigating the case as a hate crime. In Houston, a city known for its diversity and tolerance, a woman verbally attacked the owner of the Vietnamese restaurant Vietopia earlier this month in a parking lot in front of the business, screaming expletives and, ``You, get out of our country.'' ``I felt unwanted here. We were very offended,'' said Sammi Tran, co-owner and wife of the victim, who videotaped the incident. ``My husband was born here in America. We don't harm anybody, but this is happening now. I've never felt like this before.'' ``We go to the supermarket and they look at us as if we were ugly people,'' Tran said. `Racism Is Contagious' At over half a million people, Asians make up 8 percent of the population in the Houston metro area. Residents with Chinese heritage represent the third largest subgroup after Indian and Vietnamese. Roughly 70 percent of Asians in the city are U.S born or naturalized citizens, according to the U.S Census Bureau. Statewide, about 1.5 million residents identify as Asians, or 5.2 percent of the population. In Houston's Chinatown, the novel coronavirus hit businesses hard in January, well before residents were ordered to stay at home. Rumors spread on social media falsely claiming that an Asian supermarket in the area was shut down by the government due to coronavirus infections. Although there wasn't a single COVID-19 case in the state at the time, the rumors quickly propelled a fear of contagion and customers avoided the area, driving losses that reached 70 percent overnight for many Asian American businesses. Not long afterward, President Donald Trump called the agent of the pandemic ``the Chinese virus,'' stirring outrage and concern among Asian Americans. ``The community feels under siege. There is a genuine, palpable sense of fear in the Asian American community, they feel that they're being targeted,'' said Texas Representative Gene Wu, a Democrat from Houston. ``And this is not a Democratic or Republican issue. I've heard this from Democratic and Republican'' Asians. Trump recently said he was not going to use ``Chinese virus'' anymore, but some of his supporters do. ``China poisoned our people. President Trump has the courage to call it as it is: The Chinese Virus,'' the narrator's voice says over a sinister music clip in a campaign ad currently running on local television stations for Kathaleen Wall, who is in the GOP runoff for the 22nd District of Texas, representing the Sugar Land area. Asked if she didn't consider that her ad could negatively impact Asian Americans, she answered in an email: ``Leave it to Texas Democrats like Sri Preston Kulkarni to defend the Chinese Communist Party while ten thousand Americans have died because of the Coronavirus.'' Kulkarni is the Democratic candidate running in the November general election for District 22. Wea H. Lee, chairman of the Asian Southern News Group and the business organization International Trade Center in Houston, said attempts to diminish Asian people and their cultures overlook their success and integration in the country, such as having higher levels of income and education than the U.S population overall. ``These politicians, the people making this kind of statement, it's so stupid, they are so nave that they don't see really what our community looks like,' said Lee. The Anti Defamation League warns that online forums and posts, some from white supremacist groups, are ridiculing Chinese people in relation to COVID-19 and portraying them as a dirty culture. A national campaign called ``Racism Is Contagious'' is using data to raise awareness about the issue and collect reports of abuses. It shows photos of Asians wearing a mask with the message ``I am not a Virus,'' which has become a viral hashtag. Invisible stories For many Chinese Americans, the real story buried under the vitriolic noise is that their network of connections with China, Asian doctors and business people is precisely what has helped them help others during the coronavirus crisis. The North Houston Chinese American community, for example, acquired part of its donation of masks and medical supplies to local healthcare providers via their connections in China, said Yanbo Wang, one of the organizers. They raised over $14,000 in donations from 98 families and have helped seven nonprofit health providers and organizations. ``We paid for shipments to bring masks that people in China donated to us,'' said Wang. The shipment arrived right when those supplies were difficult to find. Similarly, The Pearland Chinese Association collected and donated masks and other products from many Asian Americans who bought them earlier in the year. Hearing from their families in China about the epidemic gave them an edge to prepare and acquire products before the pandemic was well known in America. Jie Wu, a board member of the association, said many Asian Americans who work in the Texas Medical Center also let them know early about concerns with medical supplies. She said they mobilized and raised thousands of dollars plus masks, gloves and protective gowns, in what the organization calls ``The Love for the Community Initiative.'' Masks were collected among school parents, many of whom worry that the stigma can hurt Asian American children born in the U.S Some reports nationwide have already pointed to hateful incidents against minors. Coco Ma, the co-founder of #SnacksForMedStaff initiative, is also concerned about the stereotyping. ``But I also want people to understand that I wanted to start the campaign not to prove who I am (and that) people should not get mad at me'' as an Asian person, said Ma. ``We Asians are doing this because we care.'' The idea of sending food to medical teams working in hospitals with COVID-19 cases came to Ma while talking on the phone with her mother, who is an administrator at a hospital in China dealing with the pandemic. Initially, she sent snacks to a few healthcare providers, but the initiative grew with people sending her money for a GoFundMe campaign. Ma, a Houston resident, and her classmate and program partner Kathleen Harcourt, [[Page H4506]] who is Asian American, have now created a website to make all the #SnacksForMedStaff activities transparent to donors. They have raised around $12,000 of a $20,000 goal and have sent food packages to hospital teams in Texas and other four states among the hardest hit by the pandemic. ``We are getting very good feedback from doctors,'' Ma said. ``They feel appreciated.'' As the coronavirus is soon expected to peak locally, adding pressure to medical teams, Ma said her initiative will raise the funding goal and provide more packages. ``People are so polarized,'' said Ma. ``Forget about politics, especially during this pandemic. Forget about race. Focus on what is the problem and coming up with a solution. This is about humanity first.'' Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I support this legislation because we have to stand to cure, to fix COVID-19, not to stigmatize and destroy the opportunity of saving America and doing the right thing by science. Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary and Homeland Security Committees, and the Budget Committee, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 908, which condemns anti-Asian sentiment in all its forms and manifestations, from whatever quarter, and from whomever, from the ordinary citizen up to and including the President of the United States. Since January 2020, there has been a dramatic increase in reports of hate crimes and incidents against those of Asian descent and the danger accelerates as the number of deaths attributable to COVID-19, which currently stands at 197,000, continues to increase and is expected to exceed 250,000 by Election Day on November 3, 2020. The use of anti- Asian terminology and rhetoric related to COVID-19, such as the ``Chinese Virus'', ``Wuhan Virus'', and ``Kung-flu'' have perpetuated anti-Asian stigma and is reminiscent of dark and shameful chapters in America's past where Asian-Americans were escaped as the ``yellow peril'' and interned in relocation camps. Madam Speaker, more than 23,000,000 Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders account for 7 percent of the Nation's population in the United States and over 2,000,000 Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are working on the frontlines of this COVID-19 pandemic in health care, law enforcement, first responders, transportation, supermarkets, and other service industries. Madam Speaker, there are approximately 2 million Asian American owned businesses that generate over $700 billion in annual revenue and employ nearly 4.5 million workers. According to a recent study, there were over 400 cases related to COVID-19 anti-Asian discrimination just between February 9, 2020, and March 7, 2020 with Asian Americans being harassed, assaulted, and scapegoated for the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, in March 2020, anti-Asian woman wearing a mask was kicked and punched at a New York City subway station; two children and two adults were stabbed at a wholesale grocery in Midland, Texas; a couple was assaulted and robbed by a group of attackers in Philadelphia; and a 16-year-old boy was sent to the hospital after being attacked by bullies in Los Angeles, California. According to a report in the Houston Chronicle, during this pandemic a different curve has emerged in the Harris County metroplex, one of outward racism toward Asian Americans, where the increased use of anti- Asian rhetoric has also resulted in Asian-American businesses being targeted for vandalism. Madam Speaker, the Secretary General of the United Nations called for international solidarity and an end to any ill-founded discrimination of the outbreak's victims. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) counsels against that naming COVID-19 by its geographic location or linking it to a specific ethnicity because such linkage perpetuates stigma. For this reason, in 2015, the WHO issued guidance calling on media outlets, scientists, and national authorities to avoid naming infectious diseases for locations. On February 27, 2020, the Secretary of Health and Human Services stated ``ethnicity is not what causes the novel coronavirus'' and that it is inappropriate and inaccurate to call COVID-19 the ``Chinese virus.'' On February 28, 2020, Dr. Mitch Wolfe, the Chief Medical Officer of the CDC said, ``Stigma is the enemy of public health'' and on March 10, 2020, Dr. Robert Redfield, the Director of the CDC, testified that use of the term ``Chinese coronavirus'' is wrong and inappropriate. So, I am proud to be an original cosponsor and to strongly support H.Res. 908 introduced by my friend, the gentlelady from New York, Congresswoman Meng. The resolution calls on all public officials to condemn and denounce any and all anti-Asian sentiment in any form and recognizes that the health and safety of all Americans, no matter their background, must be of utmost priority. The resolution condemns all manifestations of expressions of racism, xenophobia, discrimination, anti-Asian sentiment, scapegoating, and ethnic or religious intolerance and calls on Federal law enforcement officials, working with State and local officials to expeditiously investigate and document all credible reports of hate crimes and incidents and threats against the Asian- American community in the United States. The resolution also calls upon federal, state, and local authorities to so, collect data to document the rise of incidences of hate crimes due to COVID-19; and to take action whenever appropriate to hold the perpetrators of those crimes, incidents, or threats accountable and bring such perpetrators to justice. Finally, and importantly, H. Res.908 recommits United States leadership in building more inclusive, diverse, and tolerant communities and combatting misinformation and discrimination that put Asian Americans at risk. I urge all Members to join me in voting for H. Res. 908 and I thank Congresswoman Meng for introducing this important resolution. Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms. Spanberger). Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res.908. I rise today in support of my constituents of Asian descent. Central Virginia is the proud home to a strong and vibrant Asian- American community. And since COVID-19 began, we have seen a disturbing increase in hate crimes directed at the Asian-American community across the country, including in Virginia. Our neighbors, our fellow Americans, should never be the victims of discrimination, violence or derision. And today, I am proud to stand with them and support this resolution on the floor of the House. We should all actively and forcefully condemn these acts of hate directed at our friends and our neighbors, at home, across our communities. And today, I am proud to do so with my vote on the floor of the House. A vote that affirms the following: That we call on public officials to condemn and denounce anti-Asian sentiment; That we recognize that the health and safety of all Americans of any background should be our priority; That we condemn the manifestation and the expression of racism, xenophobia, and anti-Asian sentiment; That we call on Federal law enforcement officials working with State and local officials to expeditiously investigate hate crimes; and That we recommit the United States' leadership to build a more inclusive, tolerant society. Madam Speaker, to my colleagues who agree with these principles, I urge them to vote ``yes'' in support of this resolution and in support of our neighbors. I, for one, will proudly vote ``yes.'' Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the resolution for all the reasons we have articulated here this morning. I think it is important to go back and just remember, this is not about people of Asian- American descent. This is not about the Chinese people. It is about the Chinese Communist Party. It is about the Chinese Government, a government that lied to us about the origins of this virus, lied to the world, used the World Health Organization to continue to mislead the United States and the world. That has been where the criticism has been targeted by the President. But, again, 7 weeks before an election, Democrats don't care about the facts. They care about attacking the President, calling his supporters, as the Speaker of this House did, ``enemies of the state,'' bringing a resolution to the floor of this nature, but not being willing to condemn the violence and the mobs in the streets of our cities and certain places for over 100 days straight, looting and violence and rioting and attacks on our law enforcement officers. Nope, can't. We can't bring a resolution. We can't talk about that. When the Attorney General of the United States asked, the Democrat members of the Committee on the Judiciary won't even speak up then. Madam Speaker, I hope we defeat this resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Madam Speaker, this is an important resolution that will put the House firmly on record against the insidious [[Page H4507]] form of racism and racial scapegoating that we have seen since the COVID-19 pandemic began. It is completely unacceptable to use derogatory and prejudicial terms, like ``Chinese virus'' or ``Wuhan virus,'' as if they merely describe the factual reality of where the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 originated. First, this logic does nothing to justify the use of the term ``kung flu,'' another term often used by some to describe COVID-19, a term clearly designed to mock Asians and to associate them unfairly with this disease. Madam Speaker, the need for this legislation is clear. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, as millions across our nation continue to be impacted by the coronavirus, many continue to live in fear following the dramatic increase of threats and attacks against those of Asian descent since the COVID-19 outbreak. Since January 2020, there has been a significant number of reports of anti-Asian incidents; wherein, due to scapegoating Asian Americans for the spread of COVID-19, many are being threatened, harassed, or assaulted, or have had their businesses vandalized. The upsurge of racial discrimination against Asian Americans has been fueled by misinformation about the coronavirus and usage of anti-Asian rhetoric and terms like ``Chinese virus'' and ``Kung-flu.'' All of our nation's leaders must stop using these racist phrases that instigate hatred and violence. In the midst of the COVID-19 crisis, Asian Americans are left fighting an additional front--that of hate and bigotry. That is why I introduced a resolution condemning all forms of anti- Asian sentiment as related to COVID-19. We, as leaders of this nation, must coalesce and condemn all manifestations of expressions of racism, xenophobia, discrimination, and anti-Asian sentiment and scapegoating. We must denounce any and all anti-Asian sentiment of any form. Madam Speaker, during this time of heightened anxiety and fear surrounding COVID-19, we cannot lose sight of protecting the health and safety of every single person--no matter their race, ethnicity, religion, or background. The House must take a strong stand against the sickening intolerance, bigotry, and violence that is leaving a terrible stain on our nation's history, especially during this moment of an unprecedented public health crisis. The adoption of this resolution is a necessary step to confront the second pandemic of racism and discrimination in this country. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to keep all Americans safe. Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of HouseResolution 908--Condemning all forms of anti-Asian sentiment as related to COVID-19. I praise my distinguished colleague, Congresswoman Grace Meng, First Vice-Chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC), for her exemplary leadership on this Resolution on behalf of Asian-Americans and Asian and Pacific Islander communities all over the world. With this Resolution, I am reminded of the talented and brave Asians and Asian-Americans who have helped lead us through COVID-19. I think of my district's University of Toledo Medical Center's molecular specialist, Dr. Ji-Youn Yeo, Ph.D , a Postdoctoral Fellow of South Korean descent. Dr. Yeo's expertise helped the Center's coronavirus pathology lab modify its test to keep employees safe during the testing process. First Lady of Maryland, Yumi Hogan, was instrumental in obtaining 500,000 testing kits for Maryland by working with the South Korean Ambassador to the United States, Lee Soo Hyuk. The people of South Korea were able to minimize the devastation of COVID-19 on its own shores and became an example to the world by implementing lessons and procedures learned from its MERS outbreak. These efforts are a significant representation of how Asian communities are helping to combat the corona virus. To incite anti-Asian sentiments through racism, discrimination, or religious intolerance, especially related to COVID-19, is an insult to the very people who have helped shape our country. At this difficult time as we experience a resurgence of this troubling discrimination, I am reminded of my trailblazing colleagues as they continue the fight against discrimination, and through their efforts, are making our nation a fairer and more just society. One such trailblazer is the distinguished Chairwoman of CAPAC, Congresswoman Judy Chu, the first Chinese American woman elected to the United States Congress. She has served with great dignity and has been a fierce leader and advocate for Asian Americans. Former Congressman and CAPAC Chair Emeritus, Mike Honda, a statesman who was forced into a Japanese internment camp with his family in Colorado and then thrived to become a Member of the United States House of Representatives. He experienced xenophobia firsthand, and we heartfully thank him for teaching all those who face oppression that they have the ability to overcome and achieve remarkable things. I also recognize our distinguished Chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Congressman Mark Takano. He is a consummate educator and brave leader who became the first openly gay person of color to serve in Congress. These are some of America's finest patriots. I had the honor and privilege to serve with Congress' first female Member of color, Patsy Mink. A third generation Japanese American, she achieved greatness through insurmountable barriers. A fighter for the fundamental belief in equality, Mink co-authored Title IX to ensure that no person, regardless of sex, could be excluded from any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. She was ahead of her time and laid a great foundation for Asian Americans and women to follow. Congresswoman Meng's efforts today proudly honor her memory. To the current and past Asian American and Pacific Islander Members of Congress, the current 74 bicameral members of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, and the many Asian Americans who are working every day to make sure America stands tall during COVID-19, I salute them and their service to a grateful nation. I urge support for H. Res. 908. Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker. I rise today to support H. Res. 908, which condemns all forms of anti-Asian sentiment as related to COVID-19. Since the beginning of this pandemic, the Asian American community in Philadelphia and nationwide has seen an alarming surge in anti-Asian bigotry and in hate crimes. There is no doubt that COVID-19 has resulted in the spread of hate, racism, and xenophobia toward the Asian American community. As you may already know, the FBI warned at the end of March that they expected to see hate crime incidents against Asian Americans to increase suddenly as the general public associated the coronavirus with the Asian American population. At its peak, there were nearly 100 hate incidents being reported each day. Yet, the President and his Administration failed to address this and fueled this misconception with their rhetoric. Madam Speaker, words matter. This widespread racism against Asian Americans during this public health crisis is a serious and destructive issue that negatively impacts the lives of millions in our nation. Congress has a duty to address the ongoing anti-Asian sentiment and break the silence, raise awareness, and change the public perception surrounding it. In my hometown of Philadelphia, we have witnessed far too many hate crimes. Back in February, a young man and woman were physically assaulted by a group of juveniles at a SEPTA station in what appeared to be a racially motivated anti-Asian attack. In March, several Asian American homes were harassed through letters. Later in April, an Asian American-owned restaurant in my Congressional district was vandalized with spray-paint graffiti that included a racial slur. Just last month, an Asian American pregnant mother was attacked on the streets by someone who deliberately mentioned her race during the attack. The Asian American community has enriched the city of Philadelphia, and our nation, and we must do more to protect them. The prejudice against the Asian American community distracts us from finding real solutions to the pandemic at a time when they are much needed. Madam Speaker, now, more than ever, it is important to stand in solidarity with the Asian American community. We cannot let the rise in hateful rhetoric and discrimination go unchecked. We must work together to build a more inclusive and diverse society, and this resolution is a step toward achieving that. urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution to build on America's diversity, which has proven to be one of our greatest strengths. Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of HouseResolution 908, which condemns the anti-Asian rhetoric that has arisen because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Madam Speaker, our Asian friends, neighbors and family members have been unfairly targeted by bigotry in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using terms like the ``China Virus'' and ``Kung Flu'' is offensive to the communities I represent in the Lower East Side and Brooklyn. Our friends and neighbors in these communities are essential workers and small business owners who provided critical services to our community as the pandemic raged across New York City, and continue to play an essential role in our city's recovery from the virus. Unfortunately, New York City has seen a spike in bias crimes. We cannot let hate crimes go unpunished, let alone condone them. As the resolution states, there are over 2 million Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders [[Page H4508]] working on the frontline combatting against the pandemic. We must stand in solidarity with our friends and neighbors by denouncing the vitriol and anti-Asian sentiment. Our response to this pandemic should have been a unifying moment for our country. Instead, the administration has actively sought to inflame racial tensions. Today, we say ``no more'' to the anti-Asian rhetoric from the White House. I am proud to cosponsor this bill and I want to thank my colleague from New York Representative Grace Meng, for her leadership on this issue and urge all my colleagues to support its passage. Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution that condemns all forms of anti-Asian sentiment during this COVID-19 pandemic. This public health crisis has caused significant pain and suffering to communities across our nation, and we are especially concerned about an apparent increase in verbal and physical attacks, as well as discrimination, against Asian Americans. Our society must clearly state that this xenophobia must not and will not be accepted. Asian Americans are not responsible for the spread of COVID-19, and yet they have been repeatedly harassed, discriminated, and even attacked by some who wrongly believe they are at fault. There are over two thousand reported incidences of coronavirus-related discrimination by the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council. We must better protect our vulnerable communities during times of turmoil, and it is even more egregious that many of these same victims are simultaneously fighting this pandemic as doctors, nurses, and other frontline providers. Therefore, I am proud to support this resolution that explicitly calls on all public officials to condemn and denounce all anti-Asian sentiment in any form. Additionally, I am pleased that this legislation recognizes that the health and safety of all Americans, no matter their background, must be our utmost priority. On behalf of the constituents of the 30th Congressional District of Texas, I am proud to support this resolution condemning anti-Asian sentiment during this pandemic, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 1107, the previous question is ordered on the resolution and the preamble. The question is on the resolution. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3 of House Resolution965, the yeas and nays are ordered. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question are postponed.",Bias Crime

At the beginning of this month, the Obama era equal access rule was rolled back by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The equal access rule made it so shelters receiving funding from HUD are required to provide housing to transgender people living in shelters on the basis of their gender identity, rather than on the basis of biological sex at birth. With the repeal of this rule, shelters are now permitted to discriminate against members of the trans community on grounds of their own personal religious beliefs.
In addition to the new rule, the current Administration has also released a memo indicating ""ways to identify transgender women."" In response to this news, National Black Justice Coalition Executive Director David Johns released the following statement:
""These rules present a very clear and imminent danger to the trans community, a community that already faces disproportionate amounts of stigma, bias, hate crimes, and violence leading to death. In 2019, there were at least 27 known trans deaths, and more recently in 2020, more than 22 trans people have already been murdered that we know of. Moreover, of the 22 trans lives taken this year, 11 have been Black trans women, and 1 black trans man. As we work to ensure the health and wellbeing of Americans associated with the novel coronavirus it's equally important for us to ensure the holistic health and well-being of Americans, including by ensuring access to safe public housing.
""A few points are worth clarifying for those in the current administration.
* Trans women are women.
* Trans men are men.
* Non binary identities are valid and as are important as cis and heterosexual identities.
* It is the job of HUD to provide safe and affordable access to housing, not discriminate on the basis of personal and deeply ignorant beliefs.
""Trans women and men should not be denied shelter so the HUD can 'better accommodate religious beliefs of shelter providers.' Their focus should be on providing housing, rather than finding ways to discriminate.
""Over the last 4 years of the Trump Administration has been dangerously productive in denying communities of people access to social services and public goods. Call your federal elected official to request that they register disappointment with and work to reverse these problematic decisions being made by HUD.""

Roosevelt is widely remembered as a strong leader who boldly led America out of the Great Depression and to the brink of victory in World War II. Yet when it comes to the Holocaust, some defenders of FDR's record want us to believe he was not responsible for keeping Jewish refugees out of America as if that was all the handiwork of the State Department, which supposedly ran U.S. immigration policy and foreign policy independently of the president's wishes. Sorry, but you can't have it both ways. Prof. 
Daniel Greene, speaking recently at the University of Oklahoma, continued to perpetuate the implausible notion that President Roosevelt was too hapless to make his own foreign policy. Remarkably, Greene spoke for nearly an hour about America's response to Nazism and the Holocaust, yet barely mentioned the president. This tendentious approach is consistent with the theme of the controversial exhibit on 'Americans and the Holocaust' at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, for which Greene was senior curator. The exhibit has been criticized by many scholars for downplaying President Roosevelt's abandonment of European Jewry. Greene told his Oklahoma audience that the reason so few German Jews were admitted to the U.S. in the 1930s was because of 'bureaucratic walls put in place by the State Department' as if the White House had no occupant. What actually happened is that the State Department implemented Roosevelt's policy of restricting immigration far below what the existing law allowed. The annual quota of German immigrants about 26,000 was filled only once in FDR's twelve years in office; in most of those years, it was less than 25% filled. There are letters from the president himself at the time in which he acknowledged and defended the fact that visas were, as he put it, 'considerably under-issued.' There are documents showing that State Department officials briefed the president on their efforts to keep refugees out.The Battle Over Antisemitism[2]Attacking the IHRA Definition of Antisemitism Those who attack the IHRA definition of antisemitism are those who discriminate against Jews, practicing antisemitism, as defined by the IHRA. They are primarily proponents of the BDS movement. Among the bill's fiercest adversaries are leaders and members of a BDS organization inaptly called 'Jewish Voice for Peace' (JVP), who try to put a 'Jewish' seal of approval on antisemitism, misrepresenting their own antisemitic campaigns and rhetoric as human rights activism and valid criticism of Israel. The group actively agitates against the use of the IHRA definition of antisemitism and attacks the anti-BDS legislation introduced in Senate and Congress, as well as other efforts to raise awareness of antisemitism. They write op-eds and circulate petitions that falsely claim the bills are 'intended to codify criticism of Israel as antisemitic' and to 'make dissent about Israel illegal' when, in fact, neither the definition of antisemitism nor the bills proposing its use would outlaw criticism or dissent about Israel. On the contrary: The definition includes language specifying that 'criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic.' JVP leads the charge that the widely-accepted IHRA definition of antisemitism is undemocratic. The group substitutes its own alternate definition that restricts age-old hatred against Jews to Christian theology-based or Nazi white supremacist-based racial theories alone. This disingenuous propaganda is aimed at those who are unacquainted with antisemitism or with the proposed legislation against it, as it sounds an alarm against any practical attempt to hold people accountable for anti-Semitic racism and persecution of others. JVP demands that:It is vital that Jewish organizations across the globe stand united against harmful definitions of antisemitism and together for human rights and the freedom to protest. We at JVP are proud to have initiated this historic effort.In November 2017, Former Executive Director Rebecca Vilkomerson joined Linda Sarsour a vitriolic, anti-Israel, BDS activist who has been accused of outright antisemitism on a panel that redefined antisemitism to exclude the panelists' own activities. Former Executive Director Rebecca Vilkomerson (2nd to right) joining Linda Sarsour (right) in panel that redefined antisemitism. On December 15, 2020, several BDS and anti-Israel organizations are convening a panel made up of those who seek the demise of the Jewish state, in order to redefine antisemitism. The panelists include Rashida Tlaib a U.S. congress member accused of using antisemitic tropes of dual loyalty, spreading anti-Jewish blood libels, singling out politicians for criticism because of their Jewish identity, and having close ties to a Holocaust denying, conspiracy theorist and terror-supporting anti-Zionist activists; Barbara Ransby a university professor in History, African American Studies and Gender and Women's Studies who is prominent player in the BDS movement, supporting violent anti-Israel terrorists and using her platform to spread false and vicious anti-Israel propaganda; Marc Lamont Hill BDS proponent and one-time CNN journalist who advocates the elimination of a Jewish state, justifies anti-Israel terrorism, and is associated with the notoriously antisemitic Louis Farrakhan. The single Jew on the antisemitism panel is Peter Beinart an 'as a Jew' Jew who has made a career of vilifying the Jewish state and advocating its abolition.https://www.camera.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bds-antisemitism-sacks.jpgCanary Mission: Anti-Semites Lead Farcical Panel Discussion on Anti-Semitism[3]If you were assembling a panel of experts to teach the world how to dismantle anti-Semitism, who would you choose? Perhaps a well-known journalist who deals with Jewish issues like Bari Weiss or a dynamic young activist like Hen Mazzig, or perhaps you would contact one of the myriad of great organizations tackling anti-Semitism. Well, Jewish Voice for Peace, IfNotNow and friends have done the opposite. They have put together a team of anti-Israel pundits, anti-Semites and terror supporters; and asked them to lead the discussion on dismantling anti-Semitism. The farcical panel titled ""Dismantling Antisemitism, Winning Justice"" is set to take place on December 15th. LET'S GET TO KNOW THE 'QUALIFICATIONS' OF THESE PANELISTS:Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib is widely known for her anti-Israel activism and support of the BDS movement, for which she was barred from entering Israel in 2019. She has claimed that Palestinians saved Holocaust survivors and compared boycotting Israel to boycotting Nazi Germany. Peter Beinart, the ONLY Jew on the panel, has called the Jewish state a 'cancer' and lamented the Jews' 'unfortunate Zionist obsession' with Jewish statehood. He has referred to Israeli society as 'racist' and has implied that Israeli and American Jews are Nazis in relation to the Palestinians. Marc Lamont Hill was fired from his position at CNN in November 2018 for using language associated with the destruction of Israel. He has also promoted anti-Semitism, fundraised for a convicted terrorist and glorified anti-Israel violence. Read more in his NEW Canary Mission Profile[4].

The announcement comes on the heels of the historic signing off the Abraham Accords earlier this year. The in-person event will be preceded by a virtual confab on January 13, 2021. 'This is a new era for Israel, the UAE and the entire Middle East,' said Jerusalem Post editor-in-chief Yaakov Katz. 'We are moving toward an era of progress, prosperity, peace and friendship in the Middle East,' said Vaman Vassudev Kamat, editor-in-chief of the Khaleej Times. The virtual event, the UAE-Israel Peace &#38; Prosperity Roundtable, will set the tone for the bilateral relations between the two countries. The half-day conference will bring together government and business leaders around topics ranging from healthcare technology, trade and investment to politics and the stability of the Middle East. Then, in February, hundreds are expected to attend the live event to discuss the growing importance of the peace accord. 8+ years ago, when I moderated session at the Milken Global Conference in LA on Middle East.

Minister of Diaspora Affairs Omer Yankelevich decided to greenlight the move following a series of discussions with the leader of the local Jewish community Ross Kriel, in which they touched on the developing Jewish community in Dubai and its needs. UnitEd, the ministry's worldwide Jewish education initiative, will direct the process in tandem with 'significant philanthropic elements' from the Jewish world. The school is planned to open as early as next year. The Jewish community in the UAE, numbering about a thousand members, is in the process of gaining formal recognition from the Emirati government. Following the U.S .-brokered Abraham Accords the Gulf state signed with Israel in September, the community is expected to grow significantly in the coming years and the number of children is expected to stand at around 200 next year. Most community members are English speakers who moved to the UAE in the last decade from the U.S. and Europe for business purposes.Dubai Port receives first shipment of goods from Ashdod[15]Jebel Ali Port, Dubai's major shipping port, has received one of the first export shipments from Israel. The shipment, sent by Emirati firm Kimoha from Ashdod, contained adhesive tape manufactured by Israeli company Davik. The shipment is the first to arrive in the United Arab Emirates, and even more notably at one of the busiest ports in the world, since the Abraham Accords normalized ties between the country and Israel. 'We would like to congratulate Kimoha Entrepreneurs FZCO for adding value to the UAE and Israel diplomatic relations by initiating trade association with Israel-based establishments,' Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, CEO and chairman of port operator Dubai Ports World, said in a statement. 'And we are glad that Jebel Ali Port could be an intrinsic part of the transfer from Israel to the UAE,"" he said. ""We take great pride in being involved in this momentous achievement that is integral for both countries. ""This operation is just the beginning of trade and commerce activities,"" Sulayem said. ""We are confident that this move will be the starting point for trade activities that will have a significant impact on both economies, and business in the region. We are in complete support of the leadership of the UAE and will do everything in our capacity to foster trade ties with Israel and accelerate economic growth.'Mika Dagan-Fruchtman first Israeli invited to UAE tennis tournament[16]Tennis player Mika Dagan-Fruchtman has become the first Israeli tennis player to receive an official invitation to participate in a ranking tournament in Dubai which will take place over the weekend. Dagan-Fruchtman is also the first Israeli tennis player to compete in the United Arab Emirates since the normalization agreement between the United Arab Emirates and Israel was signed. The athlete received a free ticket to Dubai from the organizers of the Al Habtoor Challenge tournament with $100,000 in prize money and ranking points in the world round at stake. The tournament will be taking place for the 23rd time in Dubai with the message ""Bring the stars of tomorrow to Dubai today."" Dagan-Fruchtman, 17, is from Raanana and is an athlete for the National Tennis Academy. She is ranked among the top eight tennis players in Israel and among the top 200 in the world. She will be joined by an official delegation from the Tennis and Education Centers in Israel to promote tennis cooperation between the two nations, including former tennis player Andy Ram, who received a special permit to compete at a tournament in the UAE in 2009 after international pressure following the refusal to grant tennis player Shahar Pe'er a visa for a women's tournament in Dubai.Second Bahraini minister in two weeks arrives in Israel to expand trade ties[17]The second ministerial delegation from Bahrain in two weeks landed in Israel Tuesday morning with hopes of deepening the two countries' budding economic ties. During his three-day stay, Bahraini Minister of Industry, Commerce and Tourism Zayed R. Alzayani, who arrived with a delegation of about 40 businesspeople, is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and four Israeli cabinet members. 'The visit is very significant from our perspective,' said Eliav Benjamin, the head of the Arab world desk at Israel's Foreign Ministry. 'It is an illustration of what we and what the Bahrainis want to see in our relations progress in our cooperation. This is true normalization between our two countries: trade, commerce, meetings between delegations and ministers and businesspeople.' Alzayani's visit comes just two weeks after Bahrain's foreign minister, Abdullatif bin Rashid Al-Zayani, became the first minister from the tiny Gulf kingdom to visit the Jewish state. The commerce minister's Gulf Air plane touched down Tuesday afternoon at Ben Gurion Airport, where he was greeted by Economy Minister Amir Peretz, Regional Cooperation Minister Ofir Akunis and Tourism Minister Orit Farkash-Hacohen. His delegation was then set to head to Jerusalem for various meetings with Israeli officials and businesspeople.

Rashida Tlaib (D., Mich.) scrubbed a tweet on Monday that included an anti-Semitic phrase often used by terrorist groups that seek the destruction of Israel. Screenshots from the Internet Archive's ""Wayback Machine"" show that Tlaib retweeted a Saturday post that included a graphic promoting Palestinian solidarity and the phrase ""From the River to the Sea, Palestine will be free."" The Palestinian Liberation Organization, Hamas, and Hezbollah regularly use the phrase as a rallying cry against the Jewish state. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah used the phrase in remarks in which he also called Israel a ""cancerous growth"" that needed to be destroyed. Tlaib deleted the controversial tweet after critics slammed her, and did the same as recently as last January after she blamed Israelis for the death of a Palestinian child who had slipped and drowned in a pond, prompting accusations from an Israel government official that she was spreading a ""blood libel."" In 2018, Professor Marc Lamont Hill lost his position as a CNN contributor for parroting the Hamas rallying cry, and several Jewish groups blasted his remarks. I get why many Jews find slogan ""Palestine from River to Sea"" frightening. Some have used it to disregard Jewish rights (1st Hamas charter, for instance). But @RashidaTlaib[23] has been clear that Jews + Palestinians deserve equality.

Labour experienced a series of antisemitism scandals during Corbyn's tenure as leader from September 2015 to this past April. He stepped down after Labour suffered a crushing defeat in the December 2019 general election, and Starmer has expressed determination to purge antisemitism from Labour's ranks. Corbyn caused yet another scandal last month after the government's Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) found that Labour suffered from systemic antisemitism while he was in charge. Corbyn claimed that the EHRC findings were the result of a conspiracy against him. In response, Corbyn was suspended from Labour, only to be reinstated shortly after. Starmer then 'withheld the whip' from Corbyn, a maneuver that prevents Corbyn from sitting in parliament with the Labour delegation. The Jewish Chronicle reported that Starmer told a conference held by the Jewish Labour Movement on Sunday that Corbyn's latest antics caused serious damage to his attempts to end antisemitism in Labour and win back the goodwill of the Jewish community, saying Corbyn 'undermined me and what I was trying to achieve.' 'I felt that over the last six, seven months that we had slowly taken some steps in that direction,' he said of his campaign against antisemitism in the party. 'We had got better processes in place; we'd begun to have the engagement that we needed.' 'I wanted the publication of the EHRC report to be a defining moment where we could move on to the mend part of the exercise,' he continued. 'My team and I spent a lot of time in the days leading up to the launch of that report making sure that everybody understood the approach we would be taking so we could actually move on to that action plan.' It is amazing the way the radical left is moving against the EHRC. The organisation's crime is finding anti-Semitism in the Labour Party. So it must be undermined. A reminder that The Guardian etc do not care about racism, anti-Semitism or anything else. They just want to win. Douglas Murray (@DouglasKMurray) November 30, 2020[27] CAA says CPS 'ignoring Jewish victims' after it closes most police investigations into Labour antisemitism[28]The matter arose after the radio channel LBC and Campaign Against Antisemitism referred a secret dossier, which was compiled by the Labour Party and subsequently leaked, to the Metropolitan Police. Earlier this year, the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police came under pressure for taking so long to decide on how to proceed even on the few cases that the CPS determined might be actionable. The CPS has now reportedly ruled that the cases still held by the police did not meet the threshold for prosecution. Stephen Silverman, Director of Investigations and Enforcement at Campaign Against Antisemitism, said: 'While the rest of British society has been appalled by the rampant antisemitism in the Labour Party, the CPS is living on another planet. We referred cases from Labour to the police more than two years ago. At the time, the cases were said by top police officials and criminal barristers to be clear cut, but the CPS has only charged one of them and has now told the police to close cases on ten more activists. 'This is just the latest failure of the CPS to prosecute antisemitic hate crime. The CPS must stop ignoring Jewish victims and take antisemitic crime seriously. After years of vile antisemitic abuse from within the Labour Party, the CPS seems determined to do nothing at all about it.' Campaign Against Antisemitism's Antisemitism Barometer 2019 showed that almost half of British Jews believe that the CPS is doing too little to fight antisemitism.German Young Socialists Accused of Antisemitism for Solidarity Resolution With Palestinian Fatah Youth[29]The youth wing of Germany's main center-left political party was accused of antisemitism over the weekend after it passed a solidarity resolution with a Palestinian youth group. The Jusos the Socialist Youth Movement of the German SPD party held a virtual congress during which a resolution that described the youth wing of Fatah, the main faction of the PLO, as a 'sister organization.' The resolution lamented the 'current lack of prospects' for the Palestinians, saying that a general 'resignation and frustration' was hampering efforts for a 'peaceful solution.' 'We highly appreciate that our Palestinian sister organization, the Fatah Youth, is committed to a peaceful and sustainable solution to the conflict, even in the face of this difficult situation,' the resolution declared. Critics rounded on the Jusos embrace of a Palestinian nationalist movement whose logo renders the entire territory that is now Israel in Palestinian colors. 'Normally, youth organizations stand out for their progressive thinking, but the Jusos do it backwards: Talking about peace, promoting antisemitism,' Frank Müller-Rosentritt a parliamentarian from the FDP party commented on Twitter.When BDS means boycotting Arabs - opinion[30]The reason the BDS movement isn't targeting political leaders even in countries like Egypt is because they know they have no chance for success. Instead, they focus on artists, cultural events, and random party photos in a desperate attempt to shame artists into 'supporting Palestine' and condemning Israel. Take for example Mohamed Ramadan, who in response to the 'outrage' over his photograph made his cover photo a Palestinian flag this week. Artists and athletes are browbeaten into anything to appease the ignorant mob. But for policymakers, the mob doesn't even try. The reason that photographs of Abdel Fattah al-Sisi with Israeli officials (including the prime minister of Israel himself) aren't a target for anti-normalization advocates is because no one in the government actually cares what they think. Attacking musicians and cultural figures for collaborating (or even just taking a photograph) with Israelis, while ignoring the actual policymakers in the state working with Israel, demonstrates one of the core hypocritical elements of the BDS movement. They aren't interested in actual change, or in improving life for Palestinians. Their focus is demonizing Israel. The path to a better situation for Palestinians will not be paved by anti-normalization campaigns that target Jews, Israel, or Arab nations who work with Israel. Oppressing artists, musicians, authors, and athletes who interact in a professional capacity with Jews (or any Israelis) will not only fail to improve the lives of Palestinians, but will harm efforts toward peace. Anti-normalization campaigns harm artistic efforts to bridge the divides in our world. We must speak out against this toxic tactic.Lancaster University Students' Union BME officer told to 'stop being a Zionist shill' and a 'gay n*****r' in appalling responses to feedback form[31]Lancaster University's Students' Union's Black and Minority Ethnic Officer was told to 'stop being a Zionist shill' and '#8216;stop being a gay n*****r' in a feedback form. Last Wednesday, Max Kafula contacted students inviting them to provide feedback on his work in his capacity as an officer in the Students' Union, but he was forced to shut down the online portal following a spate a antisemitic, racist and homophobic abuse. The responses quoted above came in reply to a question on the form: 'If you said that you did not have confidence in me, what could I do to improve it?' In another question, Mr Kafula asked for suggestions of what he could do in the remainder of his term in office. One response was: 'Stop selling out to the illegitimate state of Israel.' In a statement on social media, Mr Kafula wrote: 'This is not only outright homophobic, racist and antisemitic, but it is also absolutely disgusting,' adding: 'No one should even have these views.' He has reported the comments to the police as a hate crime, reportedly saying: 'No ifs, no buts, it's a textbook hate crime.'

The 38-year-old man was also ordered to pay damages of 500 euros to his victim and another 1,000 euros to the anti-racism organizations SOS Racisme and Licra. The incident occurred on Aug. 26 as the artist was working in the center of Strasbourg on a project commissioned by the municipality. He was verbally insulted and jostled by two men after they noticed him wearing a t-shirt that displayed the names of several countries and cities, including Israel. One of the assailants aggressively told the artist, 'You are a Jew, you have no place here,' before telling the artist to change his shirt which he duly did. But when he returned to complete his work, the artist was confronted again by the same man, who grabbed one of his paint canisters and sprayed offensive slogans on the ground, including 'forbidden to Jews' and 'bitch.' In testimony to the court, the victim described his ordeal as 'the worst three hours of my life.'Dead pig found on doorstep of NJ rabbi's home in apparent bias crime: cops [39]A dead pig was left on the doorstep of a New Jersey rabbi over the Jewish Sabbath an incident that's being probed as an apparent bias crime, police told The Post on Monday. The small dead pig was discovered at the rabbi's Treetop Lane home in Lakewood at about 7 a.m . Saturday during the weekly Jewish Shabbos that began at sunset Friday. Investigators later determined the animal was left behind by someone between midnight and 7 a.m., police said. 'Currently, we are actively pursuing several leads and hope to bring this to a conclusion very soon,' Lakewood police Capt. Gregory Staffordsmith wrote in an email. No note was attached to the frightening find, which was first reported by the Lakewood Scoop. 'At this time, it's being investigated as a bias crime,' Lakewood police Lt. Leroy Marshall told The Post, adding that no arrests had been made as of midday Monday. Marshall declined to identify the rabbi, citing an ongoing criminal investigation. No injuries were reported at the residence, he said. Lakewood's police chief, Greg Meyer, told the Scoop that detectives from the agency were being assisted by the Ocean County Sheriff's Office crime scene investigations unit.

Seehofer said the group, also known as 'Wolfsbrigade 44,' 'sows hatred' and 'advocates the reestablishment of a Nazi state.' 'Anyone who fights against the fundamental values of our liberal society will feel the determined reaction of the constitutional state,' the minister said in a statement. Early on Tuesday, almost 200 police officers began searches of premises linked to 11 alleged members of the group in a number of regional states. Police found weapons, including knives and crossbows, as well as propaganda items such as swastikas and Nazi flags, the interior ministry said. Members 'openly declared their support for Adolf Hitler,' the ministry said, adding that the group was 'particularly characterized by militaristic appearance' and 'pronounced racism' as part of an 'inhuman ideology.' In July last year, prosecutors raided apartments in several German states of members accused of being part of the group, which was founded in 2016. Six were suspected of having formed an armed group within the organization, authorities said at the time. 'There was [sic] no six million Jews living in Europe at that time': American rapper Lord Jamar denies scale of Holocaust[41]An American rapper has produced a podcast denying the scale of the Holocaust. Lord Jamar, 52 (real name Lorenzo Dechalus), former member of hip-hop band Brand Nubian, is now a record producer and podcaster. In a podcast with Muslim Scientologist Rizza Islam, Lord Jamar claimed that a far smaller number of Jews died in the Nazi genocide, saying that the numbers have been exaggerated because 'there was [sic] no six million Jews living in Europe at that time.' Rizza Islam appeared to agree, asserting that he 'did the research.' If he had, he would have seen census records confirming that there were more than 9.5 million Jews in Europe before WWII, more than six million of whom were murdered in the Holocaust.Philippines awarded special certificate for support of Jews in Holocaust[42]The First Secretary and Consul of the Philippines Embassy, Reichel Quinones was awarded a special certificate by The Confederation of General Zionists (CGZ) faction of the World Zionist congress, on Sunday. The certificate is in recognition of the republic's vote in favor of UN General Assembly resolution 181 and for the Open Doors policy of former president Manuel Quezon. The certificate was awarded in a ceremony at the Philippine Embassy in Tel Aviv. The Open Door policy, in which Quezon chose to open the gates of his country to Jews after being confronted with the reality of the persecution of the Jews, their confinement to ghettos and concentration camps and their execution for no reason other than that they were Jews, saved over 1,300, according to a CGZ press release. Resolution 181 called for independent Jewish and Arab states on territory that had been under British control since the end of World War I. ""The Jewish people have a long memory and president Quezon deserves to be remembered for his brave act of kindness during such a dark period of Jewish history,"" said CGZ vice chairman David Yaari.Israeli with muscular dystrophy elected to UN committee for disability rights[43]An Israeli woman with muscular dystrophy was elected Monday to serve on a United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, garnering praise from Israeli leaders. Odelia Fitoussi, 43, is the first Israeli to serve on the committee. She was elected to one of nine available spots, receiving support from 109 countries, according to Israel's Mission to the UN in New York. 'I am sure your important voice at the UN will be a positive influence for people with #disabilities around the world. We are so proud of you!' President Reuven Rivlin tweeted on Tuesday morning. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Fitoussi, who was born with a genetic neuromuscular disorder known as SMA2, telling her that he appreciates her 'abilities and skills that led her to be elected to a significant and important position in the international arena,' according to a readout of the call provided by his office. The UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, or CRPD, is a body of independent experts tasked with monitoring the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was signed by nearly all countries in the world. Startup unveils 'new generation' rocket engines with 'PowerGel' fuel[44]Israeli startup NewRocket has unveiled what it says is a 'new generation' of rocket engines that are gel-fueled, low-cost and environmentally friendly. The company's engines are suited for space and defense purposes - in crafts of all sizes, 'anywhere you have a rocket,' CEO Ilan Harel said. The PowerGel fuel the company uses is based on technology developed by Prof. Benny Natan of the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, which was licensed exclusively to the company. 'The fuel is made of commonly used kerosene to which we added materials to transform it into a gel. And then other substances are added, that transforms this gel into a high performing, energetic and hypergolic propellant,' said Harel, declining to reveal the identity of the substances. A hypergolic propellant is a substance that can spontaneously ignite when it comes into contact with an oxidizer, he explained. The firm is still developing the rockets with the fuel, and is running development projects with 'leading aerospace corporations,' the Israel Innovation Authority, and the Israel Space Agency for a total of some $6 million, Harel said. Israeli medical delegation to fly to Italy, help contain COVID-19 spread[45]An Israeli delegation of 20 doctors and medical experts from the Sheba Medical Center in Ramat Gan will fly to Italy on Tuesday in order to help contain the spread of coronavirus in the Piedmont District in the country's northern area. The delegation was initiated by Israel's Ambassador to Rome, Dror Eydar. In a letter dispatched by Foreign Ministry director-general Alon Ushpiz to Health Ministry director-general Chezy Levy, Ushpiz explained that ""the Governor of the Piedmont District in northern Italy approached Israel's Ambassador to Rome with an urgent request to provide the district assistance in combating the spread of coronavirus, due to a dramatic increase in the number of new infections and the lack of doctors and medical equipment in the area."" The letter indicated that Israel's embassy in Italy then connected between the Israeli and Italian health ministries, which coordinated the necessary operation and agreed on the required urgent needs of the Piedmont District. The ministries also agreed on the departure of an Israeli medical delegation that will provide assistance to local Italian experts. It was agreed that the Sheba Medical Center, Israel's largest hospital, would be responsible for choosing the doctors most appropriate for the mission. The delegation will be headed by Prof. Elhanan Bar On and will include some 20 doctors from different fields of expertise. Israel to send aid team to Honduras following devastating hurricanes[46]Defense Minister Benny Gantz and Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi announced on Monday that an Israeli relief and rescue team will be sent to assist the Republic of Honduras, following the devastation left behind by hurricanes Eta and Iota which left thousands of people homeless and entire cities in rubble throughout Central America. The aid mission will be led by Head of the IDF Home Front Command, Maj.-Gen. Uri Gordon and by Tal Yitchakov, spokesperson for the Israeli embassy in Mexico, who will serve as representative of the Israeli Foreign Affairs. Israel considers Honduras one of its most important friends in Latin America, the joint statement by Gantz and Ashkenazi said. The statement mentioned that the Central American country ""regularly supports Israel in international forums"" and ""has recently made the decision to move its embassy to Jerusalem."" Shortly after the statement was published, the IDF announced that a group of experts will depart Israel later tonight in order to provide humanitarian aid in the area most affected by the hurricanes in Honduras. The group will include 15 Home Front Command retired officers and will be headed by commander of the Search and Rescue National Unit, Col. (res.) Golan Wach. The delegation will reach cities in the northwestern part of the country that were heavily damaged during the natural disaster. The Israeli delegation will be in charge of evaluating the damage and reviewing the remaining transportation, housing and sewage infrastructure and its durability. It will also work together with local authorities in order to develop response plans for similar disasters in the future.

Aired 7-7:30a ET",False,"[07:00:00]
ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN NEW DAY: Dr. Anthony Fauci has a new warning for states experiencing alarming outbreaks of coronavirus.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: I think any state that is having a serious problem, that state should seriously look at shutting down. It's not for me to say, because each state is different.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CAMEROTA: For some reason, Dr. Fauci was sidelined from the White House coronavirus task force briefing yesterday.
This morning, California and Texas are setting records for deaths in a single day. America now has surpassed 3 million confirmed cases.
JOHN BERMAN, CNN NEW DAY: This morning, 33 states are seeing a rise in cases, just three states declining. Some of the hardest-hit states reporting alarming positivity rates. That means that 28 percent of the people being tested in Arizona have coronavirus. Hospitalizations are on the rise around the country. And California, up 44 percent in two weeks, that is a huge increase.
This morning, healthcare workers across the country are again facing shortages in masks, gloves and gowns. And despite all of this, President Trump is threatening to withhold money from schools if they don't reopen and demanding that the CDC rewrite its science-based guidelines for reopening schools, because those guidelines are too tough.
Joining us now, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Sanjay, it's terrific to see you. You've actually had a few days off, which is helpful for the soul, but I think it makes it hard to come back and see what's happened over the last few days.
To come in today and see the number of new cases that are occurring every day, to see a record in daily deaths in California, at or near a record in Texas, and the direction this is going in, it's alarming. DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I thought maybe it had just been a bad dream, John. I would come back and wake up and it would all be the way it should have been. the numbers heading in the right direction, both in terms of case counts, in terms of hospitalizations, all of that, but we're not there, obviously.
So, John, let me show you something here that I think is interesting. If you look at how things have developed over the last few months here in the United States, over 3 million people now infected. January 21st, the first reported case, 99 days it took to get to 1 million cases of coronavirus. 43 days after that to get to 2 million and just 28 days, just under a month to get to another million after that. That's what's been happening in the country.
And you know, sometimes you sort of get inured to it, because you don't realize how fast things are growing, take a couple of days off, come back, and you realize that the numbers just continue to go up. So this is obviously not the direction that we need to be going in, not the direction that we have to go in. It can still turn around. None of this was inevitable.
CAMEROTA: Sanjay, don't ever do that again. Don't ever take any days off again. I see a connection, okay?
But in the meantime, I need you to try to explain to us what Vice President Pence was saying. Vice President Pence was saying something that was completely antithetical to what we're seeing with our own eyes on the screen. So here he is, yesterday.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MIKE PENCE, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: We're actually seeing early indications of a percent of positive testing flattening in Arizona and Florida and Texas.
And in Arizona and Florida, we were beginning to see declining numbers of emergency room visits, as well.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CAMEROTA: Sanjay, are you seeing things flattening and declining?
GUPTA: No, I mean, unfortunately not. And this is one of those strange things where I remember the first coronavirus task force meeting that the vice president did after some time a couple of weeks ago. And I remember thinking, these numbers -- do they have access to data that we're not seeing?
Took a couple of hours after that coronavirus task force meeting, sat down, looked at the data, compared it to what they were seeing, and it just doesn't match up. I mean, that's the thing, is that we do have access to this data. It's being sort of recruited by different places, but the data that we've been looking at, the John Hopkins University data in particular, just doesn't match up.
Arizona actually has been going up in terms of overall emergency room visits. Positivity rates, you guys have been talking about it all morning, have been going up in places across the country. And to give people context, again, out of every 100 people you test in Arizona, that means 28 come back positive. You'd want that number to below five, possibly, certainly below 10 if you're getting that high a positivity rate. That means you don't even really have eyes on how significant the problem is in your state.
And that's part of the problem. If you don't have eyes on it, the numbers continue to grow undetected. That's what happened in the early stages of this pandemic. We thought maybe we were starting to get it under control, but it was back on June 1st that we had our lowest daily case count in the United States, which was about 17,000. That's as good as we got. And the positivity rates at that point were just under 10 percent in most of the country, now they're way back up, meaning that the numbers that we're showing on the screen are probably higher than we're seeing.
[07:05:06]
BERMAN: Yes, that's the positivity rate in Arizona right now. And you can see the average, the yellow line there, the average curve is still moving up. And even to the extent that it may not be moving up as quickly, it's still at a rate that is incredibly problematic. So problematic, and I think we have the sound, I think it's worth playing again, that Dr. Fauci, overnight, Sanjay, said outright that states that are seeing an increase, and I know he's talking about Arizona, Texas, probably, California, and Florida, they need to consider shutting down. Listen.
All right, we're waiting for that sound.
But as we're finding it, I will note, again, Sanjay, that this is just different than what the administration is saying. They're saying, not under any circumstances should we shut down, which is why it's so remarkable that Fauci said this.
GUPTA: Yes, and I heard the sound earlier too. So I --
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
FAUCI: I think any state that is having a serious problem, that state should seriously look at shutting down. It's not for me to say, because each state is different.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BERMAN: Go ahead, Sanjay.
GUPTA: Yes, you know, the thing is, I would say the decision -- the idea that it's still within anyone's control, that it's somebody's decision at this point, is becoming more and more of a moot point, which is what I think Dr. Fauci is saying. And I've spoken to him recently about this.
The thing about it is that the virus is ultimately now going to dictate this. We seem to have this false sense of -- this false idea that we can still make some of these decisions. If the virus really continues to get out of control in some of these places and hospitals, which is already happening in some places, can't handle the capacity, can't handle the surge of patients, the decision is going to get made for the state, by the virus, because they're not going to be able to manage it any more.
I think that's what Dr. Fauci is saying. And he's going back to these original gating criteria, which I know I harp on, on this show all the time, the idea that the state shouldn't have opened unless they met some of the criteria in the first place, that there were specific triggers in place. The trigger was if you got five days in a row, you'd have to talk back a phase of reopening. That's obviously happened in many of these states, I think most of these now.
So it's kind of obvious just from virus standpoint what needs to happen in order to control some of this.
CAMEROTA: That brings us to schools, Sanjay. You are living in Georgia. That is a state that's seeing an uptick in deaths, in hospitalizations, in cases. Are you comfortable sending your kids back to school next month or early September?
GUPTA: I would have a hard time with it right now. I think it would be challenging.
Here is one way to think about it, and I think about this a lot. I've talked to a lot of school administrators, I've talked to a lot of parents. Overall, if the state were doing better and you said, well, look, what is the impact overall of shutting down schools on this pandemic, okay? You know, shutting down businesses, a certain percentage of impact, shutting down bars, a certain percentage of impact, movie theaters.
If you look at some of the data we have, it would suggest that schools are 2 to 4 percent roughly of impact. That's not a lot. I mean, there are other things that are going to have much greater impact, big concerts, stadium events, things like that are going to have much bigger impact. The problem is this. If your numbers are as high as they are, then 2 to 4 percent of a very high number is a high number.
If it was 2 to 4 percent of a much smaller number, which is where we could have been, should have been at this point, then, you know, you would have a better sense that, look, shutting down schools is not going to have that much of an impact on the overall trend of the pandemic, because the numbers are sort of small and trending in the right direction. The fact that they're so high right now makes 2 to 4 percent of a very high number concerning.
And, you know, I'm worried about the kids. I think that the likelihood of kids getting sick is low. I think the likelihood of them being significant spreaders is there, but not that significant. If you look at contact tracing around the world from schools, that's less worrisome. The problem is you're already in a hot viral bed and then you're adding a little bit more transmission on top of it.
CAMEROTA: John, your thoughts as the father of twins? BERMAN: Look, I and everyone I know with kids wants their kids back in school, but I and everyone I know wants it to be done safely. The idea that politics is getting injected in this is mind-numbing. It is maddening. The only discussion should be about how to do it safely.
And if the CDC guidelines, and we're going to put them up on the screen, the ones they put out in May, if these are too tough and onerous, we have issues. Wear masks where you can. Keep the desks apart. Stay home when appropriate, that means if you're sick, stagger arrival and dismissal times, have back-up staffing plans.
[07:10:04]
It seems to me that this type of guidance is the kind of guidance that will help these schools. And all these schools want to know is how they can do it safely so they can teach, so they can get kids in a situation where they can learn safely.
I don't know how you feel about it, Alisyn or Sanjay?
CAMEROTA: Go ahead, Sanjay.
GUPTA: I think if we get the numbers down overall in communities and a lot of the guidelines you just put up there are going to make more sense. Those guideline that were released in May, I think most people know this by now. We need to keep distance, somehow, we need to protect vulnerable populations. people get this fundamentally.
I think one thing that's still missing in this entire equation, which still baffles my mind a little bit, is just more widespread available testing. I mean, if you could have some sort of easy-to-do rapid response, accurate testing, have confidence that you're sending your kid to a school where, A, they don't have the virus that day or at least or in that week in their body and the people around them don't have it either, you could have a much clearer picture as well.
I still don't understand why we just haven't solved this problem. Not that it's a panacea, not that it's a solve all or cure all to all of this, but it could make a huge difference.
CAMEROTA: Oh, yes.
GUPTA: I think the guidelines that you have there in May, it's a different position now, even in July, because the numbers have clearly trended in the wrong direction.
CAMEROTA: Rapid testing would make, I think, a huge difference. Because then at least you would know that snapshot of time. And, you know, look, I have the luxury of being in a state that has seen the numbers go way down. So my state is steady or declining. So I have the luxury of being willing to take that risk, to send my kids back to school.
Sanjay, you're the father of twins also, aren't you?
GUPTA: I have 3-year-olds, 15, 13, 11, Irish twins. CAMEROTA: Oh, okay, that's very Irish of them. Okay. So only John and I are the parents of twins. John, maybe just send one back and just test it that way. That's what I would recommend for us.
BERMAN: I want them to make up their minds so the schools can concentrate on how to teach because that's what they're really good at, and all this political jerking around is only making that more difficult, I have to say, anyway.
CAMEROTA: All right. Sanjay, thank you. Thank you for all of this. Thanks for sharing your personal thoughts as well as professional.
And be sure to join Sanjay and Anderson Cooper for a new coronavirus town hall. Their guest is former CDC director, Dr. Tom Frieden, that's tonight at 8:00. P.M. Eastern on CNN.
BERMAN: All right. So school is just one example where the president is at odds with his own health officials. Perhaps, no one more than Dr. Anthony Fauci at this point, who was sidelined, literally, pushed off to the side, put in a different place for yesterday's task force briefing.
Joining us now is CNN Political Director David Chalian. David, look, there's a clear difference now. Dr. Fauci says states should consider shutting down, Trump says, we're not shutting anything down. And let me play some more sound so people can see the difference here.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, U.S. PRESIDENT: Well, I think we are in a good place.
FAUCI: We're facing a serious problem now.
TRUMP: We're almost up to 40 million in testing and 40 million people, which is unheard of.
FAUCI: This is the thing that is a little bit concerning. You say, well, we now have 37 million tests have been performed. The question is when you get on the phone and talk to the people in the community, there are still lapses there where the dots are not being connected.
TRUMP: If you look at the chart of deaths, deaths are way down.
FAUCI: It's a false narrative to take comfort in a lower rate of death.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BERMAN: David, it's a really notable political fight the president is choosing against a man and against an entire notion like science.
DAVID CHALIAN, CNN POLITICAL DIRECTOR: Yes. I mean, it's one thing, John, for the president to ignore science. That's dangerous enough in this scenario. I think it's an entirely more dangerous element to this to politicize it the way that the president is doing now. And we -- you know, in our society today, there are very few things that great majorities of Americans agree on. You know, we're long past the days of Walter Cronkite being the most trusted man in America, delivering the news. And we're a much more diffused society, obviously.
But let me just say, Anthony Fauci is the most trusted man in America on this virus issue. It is overwhelming what would Americans say in public opinion polls about him. And the fact that the president is going to try to chip away at that and somehow make Anthony Fauci's ratings lower and politicize this, when he is the one place that Americans are turning for trusted advice, that is a very dangerous game to be playing for the president.
[07:15:00]
BERMAN: And it's notable, the way he talks about schools is just one example, saying, Democratic governors don't want to open for political reasons. It's not -- there's no politically easy or expedient choice when it comes to schools, at all. They're all bad choices. There's no politically easy choice. So the president is making it even more political, a decision which should be completely devoid of politics.
CHALIAN: Yes, because the virus, John, is devoid of politics. This is an apolitical matter that we're dealing with here.
And what is so perplexing is that the path for the president's political rehabilitation is controlling the virus. So when he wants to open schools or just open the economy and businesses and just -- at any cost, just get America back to normal, because he thinks then the headlines of the virus goes away and he is able to recapture an ability to sell to the American people, that he has led on a good economy, and that he is deserving of four more years in office, but the path for him to get that hearing from the American people right now is through managing the virus. And that just seems to be beyond his compression at the moment.
BERMAN: Yes, it's interesting. It's apolitical. But to the extent that he's weighing in with it, it may be bad politics for him. David Chalian, always great to have you on, thanks so much for being here this morning.
CHALIAN: Thanks, John.
BERMAN: The City of Atlanta now requiring masks as coronavirus cases rise in Georgia. The lieutenant governor of that state joins us next.
[07:20:00]
CAMEROTA: This morning, 33 states are seeing spikes in cases, including Georgia. The state reported more than 3,400 new cases yesterday, that is its second highest day since the start of the pandemic. Joining us now to talk about this and more, we have Georgia's lieutenant governor, Geoff Duncan. Lieutenant Governor, great to see you. Thanks for being here.
Let me pull up the graph of what Georgia looks like just since you reopened parts of the state. So that was April, the end of April, April 30th. And you can see this steady incline up. This is the seven- day moving average of new confirmed cases and you're also up in deaths and hospitalizations. So what's gone wrong in Georgia?
LT. GOV. GEOFF DUNCAN (R-GA): Well, we're certainly paying very close attention to the infection rate. We obviously, across the country, are seeing an increase in infections. I think other numbers that we're continuing to pay close attention to are hospitalizations and deaths. Unfortunately for now, the data doesn't point to the exact correlation that we saw early on.
When you talk to our hospitals around the state, obviously a huge concern of ours is to make sure that there's available resources at those hospitals. We continue to hear good words from our hospital systems that there are additional resources out there.
But, you know, one of the things I think we need to continue to talk about is there are improved therapies that are continuing to arrive that yesterday on a conversation with some folks in the healthcare system, talked about the average stay on the front end of this virus was 14 days in hospitalization, and now it's down to five to seven days five.
CAMEROTA: But hospitalizations are going up in your state.
DUNCAN: Yes, certainly. And we're paying close attention to that. And, fortunately, for now, the correlation, the direct correlation between infection rates and hospitalizations don't seem to be as tightly matched, but we're going to continue to pay close attention to that.
CAMEROTA: But I guess my point is that Georgia ended it stay-at-home order long before some places. So New York's ended sometime in June. Georgia's ended April 30th. Do you think that was too early now?
DUNCAN: Well, certainly, we're trying to figure out the balance between business and the economy and obviously the healthcare concerns. But I would point to other states, you know, a state like California was probably the, you know, one of the first to close and one of the last to open. And certainly, they're dealing with an increased infection rate.
So I think it's definitely a balance. We're going to continue to pay close attention to the data. We're going to continue to push a message out there, like our governors continue to do about wearing face masks when at all possible, making sure we sterilize, making sure we take social distancing everywhere we go.
CAMEROTA: I mean, on a scale of one to ten, how worried are you about what you're seeing in Georgia? DUNCAN: Well, certainly, I think everybody, 350 million Americans are worried. There's billions of people in this world that are worried about this. We continue to try to make the best decisions we possibly can. We continue to look at the data. We continue to consult with medical professionals, with scientists, with data experts. We're trying to make the best decisions we can to move forward here.
CAMEROTA: So do you think that at this point, because hospitalizations are up, deaths are up, there should be a mask mandate in your state?
DUNCAN: Well, the position that the governor takes, and I fully support this, is that we are encouraging every single person in our state, all 11 million Georgians in every community to wear a mask whenever possible.
Certainly, I've seen great results to that. The room I'm sitting in here today, everybody is wearing a mask. I was at the grocery store yesterday, I didn't see a single person without a mask. I think this whole notion of trying to mandate somewhat becomes a distraction and it's hard to enforce.
I think we need, as leaders, continue to encourage everyone in every community to take this very seriously with social distancing, with wearing masks, with being clean and having the highest levels of hygiene.
CAMEROTA: I want to talk to you about Georgia's new hate crime law. We have followed every step along the way, as you have championed that law. It has come to pass, as you predicted on our air. There were some hiccups, obviously, and some major speed bumps with it. One was that Senate Republicans tried to include protection for the police in the hate crime law. And that was seen as, I think, something of a poisoned pill, so it ended up being turned into two separate bills.
And Ahmaud Arbery's mom basically felt that that was -- somehow, it actually tainted the results of the hate crime law, having this other law be passed in tandem to it. So let me play for you what she says. Oh, I'll read it to you. She says, though we stand in full support of all law enforcement, we believe that this separate bill, 838, is more dangerous to our community than the hate crime law, 426, is good.
[07:25:12]
To see the legislature prioritize 838 instead of repealing citizens' arrest is heartbreaking and does not do justice for my son.
What's your reaction to that?
DUNCAN: Well, certainly, I've been with you all the way through this process over the last month, trying to get the hate crimes bill from a committee room up to the floor for a vote and into the governor's desk and we've gotten to see all of that play out. I'm certainly, very proud of the Georgia State Senate and the bipartisan cooperation, state Senator Harold Jones and State Senator Bill Cowsert came together to work with us to get this across the finish line. It will never leave my mind the importance of bipartisan teamwork to tackle tough issues.
Certainly, the Georgia State Senate and Georgia as a whole definitely support law enforcement. And having two separate bills, I don't believe, taints the effort. I believe making sure that we protect bias-motivated crimes, which is what we were able to accomplish in house bill 426. And then house bill 838 was an opportunity to make sure that if somebody uses a bias-motivated intimidation against a law enforcement officer that we're able to make sure that there's recourse there too.
So I'm certainly proud of the great work -- I'm certainly glad to sit here today and be able to tell you that Georgia is no longer on that list of states that does not have a hate crimes bill on the books.
CAMEROTA: We know how important that was to you, and thank you for updating us all along the way. Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan, great to see you.
DUNCAN: Thank you.
CAMEROTA: Okay. The NBA is just weeks from its first games in what will likely be a season unlike any other. So what are players experiencing? We go inside the bubble in Florida, next.
[07:30:00]",Bias Crime
71,/content/Bias_Crime_Lexis_1.DOCX,Congressional Documents and Publications,2020-09-24,5896 words,U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES DOCUMENTS,,,"House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce Hearing; ""Mainstreaming Extremism: Social Media's Role in Radicalizing America.""; Testimony by Taylor Dumpson, Hate Crime Survivor and Cyber-Harassment Target",False,"Thank you for the opportunity to provide insight on the role social media companies have played, and continue to play, in radicalizing America. Unfortunately, I know firsthand that online hate ruins lives by stoking fear, silencing voices, and causing harm to people's physical and professional safety--all of which have a serious and lasting effect on victims and their families. And just because it happens digitally doesn't mean it should be taken less seriously. Hate should never be normalized.
On May 1, 2017--the day after I was sworn in as President--a masked perpetrator hung bananas from black corded nooses from light posts and bus stops around campus. The bananas were labeled with ""AKA"" and ""AKA FREE,"" referencing Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated (AKA) the predominately Black sorority of which I am a member, and ""HARAMBE BAIT"" referencing the gorilla that was killed at the Cincinnati Zoo in 2016. As this vile act gained national attention and was investigated by the Department of Justice as a hate crime, my story must have come to Andrew Anglin's attention.
By May 4, 2017, Anglin took it upon himself to incite a coordinated cyber-harassment campaign to encourage his followers to ""send me some words of support"" by doxing me. In other words, Anglin and many in his army of followers posted my personal information online with the intent that the information be used to harass, stalk, and threaten me, and be used against me for an unlawful purpose.
He and others provided their followers with the direct link to my Facebook page and Twitter page with calls to action. Due to his notoriety amongst the white supremacist community, Anglin's followers heeded his call to action and began to inundate my social media accounts, chatrooms, and the dark-net with racist and sexist threats and comments. This ""troll storm"" was unrelenting and went on for months. This took place on various social media platforms, websites, and chatrooms. In essence, any time my name or story was--or is--mentioned, white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and their sympathizers leave comments voicing their discontent, hate, and thinly veiled threats.
What I experienced following the May 1st hate crime was not ""just some mean words from some mean people,"" but was a part of a larger coordinated effort incited by a world-renowned neo-Nazi leader to intimidate, threaten, and harass me online. I was scared for my physical safety as bananas were already hung from nooses on my campus and was afraid that the white supremacists and neo-Nazis would act on their statements. I did not know what acts of violence Daily Stormer users were capable of doing, but I knew that this troll storm was not the first time that its users acted offline on their threats espoused online. There are reports that Dylann Roof posted on the Daily Stormer's website prior to committing the Emanuel AME Church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina. I was incredibly frightened to know the same website was targeting me.
As a result of this experience, I was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, and lost 15 percent of my body weight. Still today, more than three years later, I experience flashbacks and triggers, and am forced to take increased measures to protect myself and my family. The online hate and harassment forced me to change my daily routine, install video cameras at my house, drastically decrease my social media use, stop tagging my location in posts online, and even take self-defense classes.
Like most millennials, social media was the way that I kept in touch with friends and family, accessed the news, and stayed up to date with grassroots movements in my community. However, after the events of May 1 and May 4, I became extremely isolated and withdrawn as my ability to express myself was significantly limited due to the safety risks posed by my engagement online.
To be clear, these are not just flashbacks and triggers: the harassment Anglin and his followers incited on various social media platforms against me continues to this day. I continue to receive threatening and harassing messages three years after Anglin initiated his troll storm. Below you can find images and text of some of the threatening, racist, and sexist comments directed at me on social media platforms within the last few years.
This is why I sued Andrew Anglin, the Daily Stormer's parent company, and two other defendants in federal court for violating the District of Columbia's Human Rights Act, which prohibits individuals from interfering with someone's use of a public accommodation, with pro bono representation by the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, the Washington Lawyers' Committee, and Kirkland and Ellis, LLP.
In Dumpson v. Ade, Judge Rosemary Collyer of the United States District Court of the District of Columbia set precedent by ruling that racist online harassment can interfere with an individual's equal access to a public accommodation, as I had to make significant changes to how I navigated on a day-to-day basis. Further, Judge Collier found that ""a causal nexus exists between the troll storm created by [Andrew] Anglin... and [my] enjoyment of [American University] ...and that [I] was targeted because of my race and gender.""
Extremist Use of Social Media in Radicalizing America
Unfortunately, my personal experience as a victim of online hate and harassment is not unique or even infrequent. Social media platforms such as Facebook have allowed the worst and most heinous elements of society into my home and my life, and into yours too. It's created an open door to the kinds of people you would never allow anywhere near your loved ones in the physical world. All too often people say that what happens online ""isn't real."" Let me be clear, what happens online is very real--and the line between virtual and physical has become indistinguishable.
Over the last several years, extremists like Anglin's Daily Stormer followers have been empowered by access to the online world. The internet amplifies hateful voices to reach millions around the world. It does not take an expert to see the ways social media has become a universal tool for extremist movements to organize and engage in violence.
Social media also offers a virtual community for like-minded hatemongering individuals and groups. Online forums allow isolated white supremacists and extremists to become more active and involved in virtual campaigns of ideological recruitment and radicalization. Individuals can easily find sanction, support, and reinforcement online for their extreme beliefs or actions because the internet offers a reading and viewing library of tens of thousands of pieces of content.
The internet also allows hate to spread faster and wider than it ever has before. A meme that is generated by a dedicated antisemite on a toxic platform like Gab, 8kun, 4chan or messenger services used by extremists, like Telegram, can be disseminated almost instantaneously on more mainstream social media sites like Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, or Reddit.
Once on mainstream social media sites, these hate messages, incitement and violent threats often spread faster than content moderators can catch--or, in the case of Facebook and Holocaust denial, are willing to remove. Podcasting and video sharing sites like YouTube allow white supremacists, extremists and antisemites to broadcast their hateful ideology and speak directly to users. The hateful content is ""recommended"" to some users because social media algorithms are trained to optimize and increase user engagement. So, the most problematic content on these sites is actually recommended and amplified by the social media companies themselves.
The hate crimes and incidents I experienced in May of 2017 were not the first and far from the last time social media has been used to perpetuate white supremacy and extremism. Three months after nationalizing the online attacks against me, in August 2017, Anglin used Facebook to co-organize the white supremacist ""Unite the Right"" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, which attracted some 600 extremists from around the country and ended in deadly violence. Members of the so-called alt right descended on the small college city and clashed with counter-demonstrators, leading to scores of injuries and the death of counter-protester Heather Heyer.
Impact of Hate Online
This year in particular has seen a tectonic shift in the way communities across the world integrate digital and social networks into their daily lives. Online hate and harassment were pervasive issues long before the COVID-19 pandemic, but against the backdrop of quarantine and virtual work, school, worship and social lives, this phenomenon is more pervasive than ever. The Asian, Jewish, Muslim, Latinx and immigrant communities in particular are experiencing an onslaught of targeted hate, fueled by conspiracy theories, bigotry, and racism surrounding the novel coronavirus. Also, the social justice reckoning protesting police brutality in the wake of George Floyd's murder has spurred even more dehumanizing anti-Black racism and prejudice across social media platforms.
According to a 2020 national ADL survey (ADL's 2020 Online Hate survey), 44 percent of Americans experienced online harassment and 28 percent experienced severe online harassment--including stalking, physical threats, swatting, doxing and sustained harassment.
It does not surprise me that ADL's research also shows that targeting based on specific identity-characteristics is on the rise. The 2020 statistics show race-based harassment affected 55 percent of Asian-Americans and 42 percent of Hispanic and African-American respondents. Women also experienced harassment disproportionately, as 37 percent of female-identified respondents felt they were targeted because of their gender. Sixty-one percent of Muslim Americans who reported experiencing online harassment felt they were targeted because of their religion and 43 percent of Jewish Americans felt they were targeted with hateful content because of their religion. Forty-eight percent of LGBTQ+ respondents reported harassment based on their sexual orientation.
Online harassment impacts targets in a variety of ways. The most common response is to stop, reduce or change online behavior, which 36 percent of those who have been harassed have done. This can include steps like posting less often, avoiding certain sites, changing privacy settings, deleting apps, or increasing filtering of content or users. Many go further, with 18 percent of harassment targets contacting the technology platform to ask for help or report harassing content. In some cases, these behaviors were coupled with other consequences including thoughts of depression and suicide, anxiety, and economic impact.
I know I'm not alone in the call for change. According to ADL's 2020 Online Hate survey, Americans overwhelmingly want to see concrete steps taken to address online hate and harassment. Across political ideologies, the vast majority of Americans believe that social media companies and the government need to take action against online hate and harassment. In fact, 87.5 percent of Americans somewhat or strongly agree that the government should strengthen laws and improve training and resources for police on online hate and harassment. Americans also want platforms to take more action to counter or mitigate the problem. Seventy-seven percent of Americans want companies to make it easier to report hateful content and behavior.
Big Tech is Apathetic to the Problem
In the months and years that followed the May 1 and May 4 events, I faced hurdles and struggled to regain my sense of normalcy. My PTSD is triggered each time white supremacists' attacks or anti-black racism makes its way to the news cycle. I still struggle to sleep and often have invasive thoughts about the hate crimes I experienced. And these experiences also had lingering impacts on my family and friends' mental health.
Weeks ago, Facebook was, yet again, apathetic to racism and incitement to violence. The call to arms event that resulted in the Kenosha shooting was flagged over 450 times, but Facebook did nothing. This inaction reminded me of the Orlando Pulse Nightclub attack--where the gunman allegedly used multiple Facebook accounts to search about the Islamic State and other terrorist groups before the attack and also used the site after to see if his attack went viral. n1
This inaction reminded me of social media's role in the deadly 2017 Charlottesville ""Unite the Right Rally,"" which was organized by my attacker on Facebook and the event page was up for a month, only taken down the day before the event. n2 It reminded me of the horrors of the New Zealand mosque shootings, livestreamed on Facebook and still hosted on the platform six months later. n3 It reminded me of Pittsburgh, El Paso, Poway, and too many other violent (and often fatal) hate crimes in which Facebook (and Big Tech) played a central role.
In ADL's 2020 Online Hate survey, 42 percent of daily Facebook users experienced harassment on the platform. Of those respondents who were harassed online, like I was, more than three-quarters (77%) reported that at least some of their harassment occurred on Facebook. It is a hotbed of hate and an all-too-easy platform to harass and terrorize targets. Below are just a couple images the Stop Hate for Profit Coalition recently shared with supporters. These images were found on Facebook in August and September 2020.
Stop Hate for Profit
In response to social media's repeated failure to meaningfully address the vast proliferation of hate on their platforms--and Facebook's particular role in this proliferation, ADL, Color of Change, Common Sense, Free Press, LULAC, Mozilla, NAACP, National Hispanic Media Center, and Sleeping Giants launched a campaign called Stop Hate for Profit. In July, the campaign called on advertisers to engage in a one-month ad pause. In September, just last week, the campaign called on A-List influencers to freeze their Instagram accounts and highlight Facebook's inaction toward electoral misinformation, hate, violence and racism.
I strongly support the Stop Hate for Profit campaign. I know what it is like to be the target of daily racist and misogynist posts, to receive threats online, and to be the subject of extremist group chats. Their request for Facebook (and the rest of Big Tech) to increase accountability, decency and victim support on the platform resonates with me both as an advocate and as a survivor (and enduring target) of online abuse. And I find comfort in knowing that thousands of major businesses including Volkswagen, Unilever, Verizon, Walgreens, KIND, Pfizer, Colgate-Palmolive, Williams Sonoma Inc., North Face and Patagonia joined in an ad pause to call on Facebook to address rampant hate, racism and disinformation on its platforms. On the other hand, it's disheartening that Mr. Zuckerberg immediately dismissed this campaign, insisting that advertisers will be back on the platform ""soon enough."" I understand that this is because Facebook's vast user base and reach provides a captive audience for advertisers to micro-target and engage.
Not surprisingly, when it comes to dealing with rampant hate and harassment, the platform continues to come up short--responding with PR moves at best, and apathy more often. When will enough be enough? What are they doing with $70 billion in revenue and $17 billion in profit? Their hate speech, incitement, and misinformation policies are inequitable. Their harassment victim services are inadequate. Their advertising placement's proximity to hateful content is haphazard. And their ""civil rights"" audit transparency reports aren't helpful to the civil rights community.
Backspace Hate
As our online lives have become even more central to the way we work, communicate and socialize in this unprecedented time, it's also gotten easier than ever before for individuals to harm their targets online. I speak from personal experience. I know what it is like to have every aspect of my life invaded with racist, misogynist comments, threats and images. I know what it is like to be the target of cyberstalking and doxing--it is something no person should have to experience. But, if they do, our government needs to support the targets of these crimes and hold perpetrators accountable.
But do not take my word for it. As I mentioned above, ADL's 2020 Online Hate survey found that 28 percent of Americans experienced severe online harassment, including sexual harassment, stalking, physical threats, or sustained harassment. ADL has also done deep ethnographic research and found that individuals who were the targets of intense harassment campaigns experienced significant emotional and economic burdens. In response to these trends, over 85 percent of Americans want policymakers to strengthen laws to prevent such acts.
I'm a big supporter of ADL's ""Backspace Hate,"" a national initiative to fight the escalating problems of harmful online activities, including cyber harassment, cyber stalking, swatting, and doxing, through updating legislation and raising awareness. Doxing is one form of online harassment that does not have adequate legal protections for targets at the state or federal level. These are tactics extremists have used to harass and terrorize targets. Swatting is the false reporting of an emergency with the goal of having a police unit or emergency response team deployed to a dwelling. It has been increasingly used as a digital harassment tactic and has resulted in injuries and trauma (and even a fatality) to both targets and unintended victims.
The prevalence of these problems is only increasing. In fact, in January 2020, one individual who was sympathetic to neo-Nazi ideology and loosely associated with the neo-Nazi group, the Atomwaffen Division (AWD), was caught after having worked with others from Canada and England to target people in a series of multi-national swatting and doxing incidents. According to ADL's Center on Extremism, cyber-harassment has been at the forefront of AWD tactics since the group's inception in 2016.
Shockingly, there are no protections for doxing or swatting at the federal level. And, in far too many states common digital tactics harassers use to harm their targets are not considered unlawful. I was able to sue my online tormentors, but my lawyers should not have had to find a novel legal theory and a DC-specific law to bring my case to court. What I experienced was hate crime after hate crime. I sued Andrew Anglin, The Daily Stormer, and two other individuals--this did not account for the thousands of people threatening my life online daily.
As part of ADL's Backspace Hate effort, several states are pursuing bipartisan legislation that address severe online harassment by holding perpetrators accountable for their actions online. For example, this past legislative session, Washington State showed tremendous leadership in enacting anti-swatting legislation protecting targets and victims from the serious and potentially fatal consequences of this digital abuse. Washington's law makes swatting a felony when it results in someone being injured or killed. The legislation also gives swatting victims and targets the right to sue and allows law enforcement or a city to seek damages. While some states have anti-swatting laws, too many do not.
In addition to advocating for specific legislation, ADL is harnessing its resources and expertise by raising awareness among policymakers, law enforcement, and supporters; building coalitions with diverse partners; gathering petition signatures to deliver to legislators; publishing research on these issues and their effects on targets; and providing recommendations for technical solutions.
Hate Crimes
While I have focused mostly on the cyber harassment components of my experience, let me end where this started: a hate crime investigated by the Justice Department. Unfortunately, it is unusual that the hate crime against me was reported. It was the American University public safety department that made the intial report--not me. Often, victims of hate crimes do not come forward to report their experiences because they either do not trust the police, believe the police are unwilling to act, or have reason to believe they are unable to respond effectively to a hate crime. For example, I reported the cyber-harassment itself to the Metropolitan Police Department, but never heard back. That's why law enforcement's role in responding to and reporting incidents, both online and on the ground, is so important.
While I was afraid of being physically attacked on campus and at home, many Americans are afraid that they will be attacked in their house of worship, their supermarket, or walking down the street. 2018 saw the highest number of hate crime murders on record, with 24 victims. n4 The second highest year for hate crime murders was 2000, with 19 victims. n5
While FBI statistics are essential, we know they are incomplete. 16,039 law enforcement agencies in the United States participated in the 2018 data collection effort--the second highest level of participation since the enactment of the HCSA in 1990, but a slight decrease from 2017 record participation of 16,149. Importantly, only 2,028 of these agencies, less than 13 percent, reported one or more hate crimes to the FBI. That means that 87 percent of all participating police agencies affirmatively reported zero (0) hate crimes to the FBI (including at least 77 cities over 100,000). And eight more law enforcement agencies over 100,000 did not report any data to the FBI. According to anti-hate groups like ADL, that specialize in understanding hate crimes and advocating for more protections for targets, reports of zero hate crimes are simply not credible. These reports suggest that the number of hate crimes in America is far greater than what is reported.
It's been brought to my attention that the federal government has an essential leadership role to play in confronting hate crimes and in alleviating intolerance. The most effective response is to explicitly call out bigotry whenever and wherever it happens, and to strengthen federal hate crime prevention and response.
I am hopeful about the enactment of hate crimes laws. This is a matter with bipartisan support, as demonstrated in Georgia, which in June passed a comprehensive and inclusive hate crime law and joined the 45 other states with hate crimes laws on the books. I was heartened to learn that Governor Brian Kemp signed into law House Bill 426, the ""Georgia Enhanced Penalties for Hate Crimes Act,"" with protections that go into effect immediately.
ADL leads the Hate Free Georgia Coalition, which played an important role in securing the passage of HB 426. HB 426 provides stronger penalties for individuals who target victims because of their actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender, mental disability, or physical disability. It also requires local law enforcement agencies to collect data on hate crime investigations and provide ""Bias Crime Reports"" to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, which is essential for effective enforcement of the law. This was a critical step towards addressing systemic racial injustice in that state. Still, there is more to do. There are states without adequate hate crime protections and hate crimes going uninvestigated or unreported. We need the full picture.
Policy Recommendations
In partnership with ADL, I want to share the following measures that, taken together, can immediately help combat the rise in physical and online hate crimes, as well as hate incidents in general:
1. Use the Bully Pulpit to Fight Hate: Words have power
o Speak up and call out racism and bigotry at every opportunity. The right to free speech is a core value, but the promotion of hate should be vehemently and consistently rejected. Often, people will say that the answer to extremism and hate speech is more speech. That premise is inherently flawed because it assumes incorrectly that more speech would be counter-speech, not simply be more hate speech. While at one time that argument might have been persuasive, during my lifetime--in the digital age--the hateful voices too often just drown out the others.
o In this environment, the importance of ensuring that the fight against extremists not be politicized--all the more so close to the election--cannot be overstated.
2. Improve Federal Hate Crime Data Collection, Transparency and Support
o The Department of Justice should incentivize and encourage state and local law enforcement agencies to more comprehensively collect and report hate crimes to the FBI, with special attention devoted to large underreporting by law enforcement agencies that either have not participated in the FBI Hate Crime Statistics Act program at all or have affirmatively and not credibly reported zero hate crimes. More comprehensive, complete hate crime reporting--including reporting online hate crimes--can deter hate violence.
o The federal government should provide funding for criminal investigations and prosecutions by state, local and tribal law enforcement officials, as authorized by Section 4704 of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009.
3. Pass Legislation to Fight Hate
o Pass H.R. 1931, the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act: This legislation would enhance the federal government's efforts to prevent domestic terrorism by authorizing into law the offices addressing domestic terrorism and requiring federal law enforcement agencies to regularly assess those threats and then deploy resource to the threats. The bill would also provide training and resources to assist non-federal law enforcement, requiring DOJ, DHS, and the FBI to provide training and resources to assist state, local, and tribal law enforcement in understanding, detecting, investigating, and deterring acts of domestic terrorism.
o Pass H.R. 3545, the Khalid Jabara and Heather Heyer National Opposition to Hate, Assault, and Threats to Equality (NO HATE) Act of 2019, which would authorize incentive grants to encourage improved local and state hate crime training, prevention, best practices, and data collection initiatives--including grants for state hate crime reporting hotlines to direct individuals to local law enforcement and support services.
4. Support More Anti-Bias Education and Training
o Recognizing that hate cannot be legislated or regulated out of existence, Congress should provide increased funding for inclusive school anti-bias education, civics education, and bullying prevention programs.
5. Address Online Hate and Harassment Through Legislation and Training
o Review the tools and services platforms provide to targets: Targets like myself rely on platforms to provide tools and services to report the online hate and harassment I regularly receive. I can tell you from personal experience, it isn't enough. Congress should commission research that provides a summary of the available mechanisms provided by platforms to their users to protect and defend themselves. The review process should also include a needs assessment of users and a gap analysis of available tools and services.
o Strengthen laws against perpetrators of online hate: Hate and harassment exist both on the ground and online spaces, but our laws aren't doing enough. Many forms of severe online misconduct are not consistently or adequately covered by our current cybercrime, harassment, stalking and hate crime laws. State and federal lawmakers have an opportunity to lead the fight against online hate and harassment by increasing protections for targets as well as penalties for perpetrators of severe and abusive online misconduct.
. In July 2017, in the 115th Congress, Representative Katherine Clark introduced and lead H.R. 3067, the Online Safety Modernization Act, which, among other things, would have provided federal protections against doxing and swatting. We desperately need these protections.
o Improve training of law enforcement: Though the physical threat I experienced was classified as a hate crime, the online hate and harassment that terrorized me was not. Law enforcement should be a key responder to online hate and harassment, especially in cases like mine that involve direct threats. I know these cases are complicated but that is not an excuse. We must increase training and resources for agencies to ensure law enforcement personnel can better support targets. Additionally, law enforcement training on stalking, harassment, and threats should be modernized to reflect the role the internet plays in the 21st Century. Too often, local law enforcement agencies are not adequately equipped with technology or personnel to address the nuance in this area. Better training and resources can support better and more effective investigations and prosecutions.
. The Department of Justice should also incentivize and encourage state and local law enforcement agencies to specifically incorporate cultural competency and trauma-informed trainings into their hate crime response trainings, as far too often survivors and targets of hate crimes are uncomfortable with reporting their experiences to members of law enforcement for fear of retraumatization. Though I reported some of the most egregious instances of hate directed at me to law enforcement, the vast majority of times I did not because of my experiences with law enforcement officers failing to act with cross-cultural awareness and empathy.
6. Urge Social Media Platforms to Institute Stronger Means to Measure and Address Online Hate and Harassment
o Strengthen and Adequately Enforce Policies Against Hate: Social media platforms should have better community guidelines or standards that comprehensively address hateful content and harassing behavior, and clearly define consequences for violations. Platforms should prohibit toxic content from being monetized to ensure their platform cannot be used to fund extremist individuals, groups and movements. Social media platforms also need to invest in enforcement. Platforms need to use a mix of human reviewers, AI, and an appeals process that all work together to enforce their policies. Social media platforms owe their consumers an equal opportunity to engage in the digital space irrespective of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or other identity-based characteristics. However, platforms fail to satisfy that obligation when they prioritize the speech rights of extremists to that of marginalized communities, who are silenced when platforms amplify hate.
o Expand tools and services for targets: Given the prevalence of online hate and harassment, platforms should offer far more services and tools for individuals facing or fearing online attack. Targets should be allowed to flag multiple pieces of content, or even an entire thread, within one report instead of having to create a new report for each piece of content being flagged. I am now used to reviewing, filtering, identifying, screenshotting, and saving multiple threatening and harassing comments on a monthly basis, in the event that the comments rise to the level of a ""true threat,"" specifying time, place, and manner of attack--but I should not have to be. And even when I have used the reporting mechanisms provided on various social media platforms, the platforms have either failed to remove the content.
o Alternatively, I have also received messages that platforms have decided to keep up the abusive content I have reported because it allegedly does not violate their community standards. The messages I have received that have remained up are personally violating and it is unfathomable how they would not violate community standards. I should be able to trust that social media platforms will regulate the content posted on their sites and prevent their platforms from being used to by extremists to mobilize and act on hate. The arduous process of capturing images of violating content and reporting can and should be improved. The burden of bringing hate and extremism to the attention of social media platforms should not be on the victims and targets.
o Increase accountability and transparency: Platforms need a better civil rights infrastructure. They should be subject to external, independent audits. Right now, the only people who truly know the extent of hate and harassment on platforms are targets, perpetrators and the platforms themselves. I was encouraged to learn that Consumer Protection and Commerce Subcommittee Chair Jan Schakowsky along with other Energy and Commerce Committee leadership voiced concerns about the newly launched Facebook Oversight Board, because of the lack of power it has to actually drive the necessary accountability and transparency measures necessary to decrease hate and extremism on social media. The public needs to know about the extent of hate, extremism and harassment on a given platform. Audits would also allow the public to verify that the company is following through on its promises. Transparency reports should include data from user generated identity-based reporting.
Conclusion
Thank you for calling this important hearing and for the opportunity to submit this testimony. ADL data clearly indicates that my personal experience is unfortunately not unique, that hate is rising across America and that crimes like doxing and swatting pose a significant threat to our communities. Everyday Americans are subjected to hate online but, too often we are told that because these comments and threats were made on social media platforms little can be done to regulate these actions and prevent them from happing in the future. But a lot more can be done, and Congress must be a part of the efforts to de-radicalize social media.
This is a time for leaders to lead. I urge you to speak out about the threat, legislate against it and encourage social media companies to address online hate in their platforms, so we can prevent future hate crimes and protect targets like me.

72,/content/Bias_Crime_Lexis_1.DOCX,Newstex Blogs,2020-07-15,7064 words,,Ian,,07/15 Links Pt2: The Attacks on the Uniqueness of the Holocaust; Israel's outgoing U.N. ambassador: 'We have to fight anti-Semitism on all fronts'; Israel's law against slavery,False,"Jul 15, 2020( Elder of Ziyon: http://elderofziyon.blogspot.com Delivered by Newstex) From Ian:BESA: The Attacks on the Uniqueness of the Holocaust[1] The last decade has seen an explosion of attacks on the memory of the Holocaust. This expresses itself in many ways, including the casting of doubt on the Holocaust's uniqueness. This version was aired in recent public debates in Germany and can also be found in historical manipulations by academic scholars.The memory of the Holocaust has been under assault for decades from all sides: the extreme right, the extreme left, and parts of the Islamic world. A common tactic is to assert that the Holocaust was not unique, contrary to the Jewish claim.Looking at the question on a purely empirical basis, the Holocaust was unambiguously a unique event. 
While some elements are comparable to other genocides, its combined characteristics are not. Several criteria collectively make the Holocaust an unprecedented event: the totality of the targeting (all Jews everywhere), its priority (all branches of the German state were involved in the effort), its industrial character, and its impracticality (instead of exploiting Jews for labor purposes, they were killed.)Leading Holocaust philosopher Emil L. Fackenheim noted that the Armenian genocide was confined to the Turkish Empire. And even within that empire, not all Armenians there were targeted—for instance, those living in Jerusalem were spared. Geographical confinement also applies to the genocides in Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia, and Sudan.As Fackenheim pointed out, the Nazis, by contrast, set out to exterminate every last Jew on the face of the earth. He said that while the Holocaust does belong to the species 'genocide,' the planned and largely executed borderless extermination of the Jews during the Holocaust is without precedent and, thus far at least, without sequel. It is thus entirely appropriate to call it 'unique.'https://2.bp.blogspot.com/proxy/25fnoK24JhrNW3DCeVggYDSY3k--yayeIjF8kC7OxsiVWcyZQx0Eojvd3uU9SHeRJZlg6VULguXfV-5S-WEa=s0-d Israel's Centrist Consensus[2] So 'Left' and 'Right' mean only one thing in the Israeli context: where you stand on relinquishing territory in the Land of Israel, particular regarding the territories of Judea &#38; Samaria (the mountainous regions overlooking the coastal plain) and the Jordan Valley, liberated from Jordan's 19-year illegal occupation (1949-1967) in Israel's 6-Day War of defense of June 1967.Radical Leftists promote immediate and unilateral, unconditional withdrawal from what they term 'occupied' territories (misrepresenting the Geneva Convention of 1949); the less extreme Left supports a negotiated withdrawal from most of these disputed territories. Both support - with more or less enthusiasm - the idea of the establishment of a 'Palestinian' state in those territories.Extreme Rightists claim all of the biblical Land of Israel and historical Mandatory Palestine as Israel's patrimony, based on various international legal instruments like the San Remo treaty, and reject any notion of an Israeli withdrawal; they dismiss a 'Palestinian' identity separate from wider Arab nationalism, oppose vigorously the idea of a Palestinian state, and would like to see most Arabs who identify as Palestinian move to neighboring Arab states. The less radical Right grudgingly acknowledges a 'Palestinian' movement but insists this can be accommodated within existing nation-states in the region, promoting various forms of autonomy, and focuses on Israel's security needs and the belligerence of the Arab and Palestinian leadership, noting the unlikelihood of any real peace possibilities in the near future.The middle ground - incorporating various aspects of the more restrained concepts of both the Right and Left in Israel - is actually the 'high ground' held by a majority of Israelis, proven in polls and at the ballot box over the past few decades. This is what I call the moderate Center in Israel, and it is far more powerful, and widespread, than most people realize - not least as it doesn't get the headlines with pithy media phrases like 'Peace Now' and 'Annexation', or 'Destroy the terrorists' and 'Disengagement' and the like. Ironically but significantly, every government and prime minister of Israel, with perhaps the exception of Ehud Barak in 1999-2000, has followed the policy lines of this centrist trend - even 'Leftists' like Shimon Peres (who used conservative economic policies to save Israel's economy in the '80s) and 'Rightists' like Menachem Begin and Ariel Sharon (who were the only Israeli prime ministers to withdraw from territories with Israeli civilian communities living in them).Where is the 'Center' marked? For English speakers' reference, Rabbi Daniel Gordis is right there, as are journalists/commentators like Yossi Klein Halevi and Haviv Rettig Gur, and historian Gil Troy; former minister and human rights activist Natan Sharansky and former Labor party MK Einat Wilf; and many of the politicians and thinkers and supporters of Blue &#38; White (Benny Gantz, and Moshe Yaalon, less so Lapid's Yesh Atid), Likud (which has also right-wingers of course in it), and Labor (which has also left-wingers, mostly in fact, of course).But forget the political parties and labels: read anything by Amotz Asa El (he writes a column in the JPost called 'Middle Israel') or for that matter anything I write. There are Centrists in almost every Israeli political party and movement, except the hard Left and the hard Right, both of which are peripheral in Israeli society though they receive substantial press coverage. Even most of the 1.4 million Arab Israelis, some 20% of Israel's population, can be included, perhaps ironically, in this category (though for historical, social, religious and cultural reasons many of them unfortunately vote for the most radical, anti-Israel, antisemitic and belligerent politicians to represent their sector in the Knesset). This is clear from both their behavior and polling data. (h/t Yerushalimey)Phyllis Chesler: Israel's law against slavery[3] Bravo, Kudos, every kind of Kol Ha Kavod, to all those Knesset members, on both the right and the left, especially former Justice Minister, Ayelet Shaked, and Gilad Erdan, then-Minister of Internal Security (now Israel's new Ambassador to the United Nations), who worked on the new legislation that criminalized customers (""Johns""), not prostitutes; who understood that prostitution is violence against women; and who were wise enough to also pass a funded enforcement provision which has just gone into effect.This is a revolutionary law because it recognizes that prostitution is violence against women.Although the issue is hotly debated, especially among feminists ('sex workers have to eat, they can't starve'), I stand with Knesset member, Shelly Yachimovich (Labor) who stated: 'The war against prostitution is like a war to free the slaves.'Oddly enough, many anti-capitalist feminists rarely glorify mind-numbing factory, agricultural, or low-level office work. They are clear that the 'workers' are being oppressed. When it comes to prostitution, the alleged 'work' is often viewed as a form of resistance, rather than as a forced choice, as a 'job' which they actually say allows women greater independence than marriage ever can.If caught, the newly criminalized customers ('Johns'), will have to pay a fine of 2,000 shekalim ($580.00). Repeat offenders might face criminal charges.This is not the first time that I've been called upon to write about the Israeli heroes who were and still are fighting violence against women. Dr. Anat Gur is a pioneering Israeli therapist, the founder of the Women's Wisdom Center, a professor at Bar Ilan, and an author (Women Abandoned: Women in Prostitution, Foreign Bodies: Eating Disorders, Childhood Sexual Abuse, and Trauma Informed Treatment), has worked with women prisoners, incest and eating disorder victims, and prostitutes since 1984.According to Dr. Gur: 'Prostitution is not a job or a livelihood for women. In addition to the severe violence, humiliation, and ongoing rapes, it is not 'easy money' for anyone but the pimps and traffickers of women, not for the girls and women who are exploited as prostitutes. Prostitution is the direct continuation of the exploitation of the most vulnerable women in society, those who have already been 'groomed' by childhood incest, and are ready to be exploited as prostitutes.'Dr. Gur independently confirmed the important, and also long-time research of Dr. Melissa Farley, namely that the complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorders among prostitutes are more severe than the Stress experienced by many combat veterans of more recognized wars. Dr. Gur told me: 'While exploited in prostitution, they are completely disassociated and disconnected and cannot afford to tell what is really happening to them.' WaPo: Israel's outgoing U.N. ambassador: 'We have to fight anti-Semitism on all fronts'[4] Israel's outgoing ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, spoke to The Washington Post about his five years in the position, security threats in the region and anti-Semitisim. The following is a lightly edited transcript.Q: On Jan.?27 of this year, you tweeted a video to remember the victims of the Holocaust and included the voices of several other ambassadors to the U.N. Why did you do that? A: The issue of anti-Semitism is very important to me — it is a global issue. We should not be silent about it. That's why I dedicated a lot of effort to educate my colleagues at the U.N. about the danger of hate [and] anti-Semitism.Q: In this fight against anti-Semitism, how important is it to also fight the glorification of the Nazis or Nazi symbols? A: I think we have to fight anti-Semitism on all fronts. Today with social media it is a challenge, and we have debates with scholars and legal experts about what we can do regarding, hate crimes, how to deal with freedom of speech and where we draw the line. We cherish freedom of speech, but we cannot cherish freedom of hate.Q: Were you directly confronted with anti-Semitism during your time at the U.N.? A: I had difficult moments, both when you hear the voices coming from Iran or the hate crime in Pittsburgh here in the U.S.Q: You mentioned in interviews trips to Dubai and to other Arab countries. How is Israel's relationship with the Arab states at the moment? A: It's a very important and strategic relationship, beneficial for both sides. We share the common threat over the Iranian regime, which is threatening the entire region.We collaborate and can collaborate more. The issue is whether the Arab states actually recognize, publicly, the accomplishments and cooperation. I think it is about time to move to the next level and to see what we can do publicly, not only behind closed doors.Guardian op-ed attacks liberal Zionists (or anyone supporting Israel's existence)[5] We were expecting the Guardian to weigh in on Peter Beinart's recent conversion from 'liberal Zionist' to anti-Zionist, and, sure enough, yesterday they published an op-ed by Joshua Leifer, Beinart's colleague at Jewish Currents - the site that ran his call for an end to the Jewish state.Leifer's piece ('The two-state solution is a political fiction liberal Zionists still cling to', July 14) attacks liberal Zionists - whose members included, until two seconds ago, Peter Beinart - for advocating the 'political fiction' of two states. He then suggests that Israeli support over the years for two-states was a 'washing' of sorts - a public relations scheme to deflect criticism of what he later called the state's 'territorial expansion'. The abstract idea of two states has also served a valuable strategic purpose for the Israeli government and professional Israel advocates. References to Israel's putative commitment to two states in theory have become a way to shield Israel from criticism, and consequences, for actions that in practice rendered a two-state solution impossible.In order to maintain his fiction that when Israeli leaders said they supported two-states they didn't really mean it, Leifer (like Beinart in his piece) has to erase the fact that PA leaders have, on three occasions, rejected Israeli peace offers that would have resulted in a two-state solution. The offers would have created a sovereign Palestinian state in over 90% of the West Bank, 100% of Gaza, and a capital in east Jerusalem.Perhaps it's not surprising that Leifer omits such important historical facts, as to do so would require acknowledging that Palestinians possess moral agency, and that their leaders' bad decisions have invariably led to bad outcomes.Leifer than scolds 'self-defined liberal' Zionists for the fact that they still won't 'confront their contradictions, or surrender their talking points'. The liberal Zionist groups he's attacking, he makes clear in a subsequent sentence, includes J Street, Americans for Peace Now and other leftist groups that are extraordinarily critical of Israel, yet, unlike the Guardian writer, support Zionism.Then, after erroneously claiming that all West Bank Palestinians live under Israel's 'military dictatorship', ignoring that the overwhelming majority live in PA ruled Area A, he goes after liberal Zionists again: the position staked out by Dermer and the Trump administration is not that different from the liberal Zionist one: both envision a Palestinian 'state' as an archipelago of isolated, non-contiguous Bantustans subordinated to Israeli control.It's unclear what he bases this on. But, the fact is that the Israeli offers we noted previously would have included a territorially contiguous Palestinian state in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, with a free passage route to connect Gaza.Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Where Is the Outrage Over Anti-Semitism in Sports and Hollywood?[6] The Hollywood Reporter columnist calls out the hateful outbursts against Jews by Ice Cube, DeSean Jackson and others and explains how the muted response ""perpetuates racism"" and contributes to an overall ""Apatholypse.""Recent incidents of anti-Semitic tweets and posts from sports and entertainment celebrities are a very troubling omen for the future of the Black Lives Matter movement, but so too is the shocking lack of massive indignation. Given the New Woke-fulness in Hollywood and the sports world, we expected more passionate public outrage. What we got was a shrug of meh-rage.When reading the dark squishy entrails of popular culture, meh-rage in the face of sustained prejudice is an indisputable sign of the coming Apatholypse: apathy to all forms of social justice. After all, if it's OK to discriminate against one group of people by hauling out cultural stereotypes without much pushback, it must be OK to do the same to others. Illogic begets illogic.Ice Cube's June 10 daylong series of tweets, which involved some creepy symbols and images, in general implied that Jews were responsible for the oppression of blacks. NFL player DeSean Jackson tweeted out several anti-Semitic messages, including a quote he incorrectly thought was from Hitler (not your go-to guy for why-can't-we-all-get-along quotes) stating that Jews had a plan to 'extort America' and achieve 'world domination.' Isn't that SPECTRE's job in James Bond movies?These statements would be laughed at by anyone with a middle-school grasp of reason, but then former NBA player Stephen Jackson, a self-proclaimed activist, undid whatever progress his previous advocacy may have achieved by agreeing with DeSean Jackson on social media. Then he went on to talk about the Rothschilds owning all the banks and his support for the notorious homophobe and anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan. That is the kind of dehumanizing characterization of a people that causes the police abuses that killed his friend, George Floyd.ViacomCBS Drops Nick Cannon After Anti-Semitic Tirade[7] ViacomCBS dropped Nick Cannon from its MTV network following an anti-Semitic tirade in which the host, among other things, accused Jewish people of controlling the global banking system.""ViacomCBS condemns bigotry of any kind and we categorically denounce all forms of anti-Semitism,"" the media conglomerate, which owns MTV, VH-1, and Cannon's 'Wild 'N Out' television show, said in a statement Wednesday. ""We have spoken with Nick Cannon about an episode of his podcast 'Cannon's Class' on YouTube, which promoted hateful speech and spread anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.""Cannon sparked a firestorm of criticism earlier in the week after he praised anti-Semitic leader Louis Farrakhan and spread conspiracy theories about Jewish people during an episode of his YouTube show. Cannon issued a non-apology in which he said he does not condone hate speech.Fox Television and the producers of Cannon's upcoming daytime talk show have remained silent about his comments. Cannon hosts Fox's The Masked Singer television show and is currently working on a daytime television show with Lionsgate's Debmar-Mercury group. This insane person is the black feminist activist Angela Davis, huge inspiration behind Critical Race Theory thought and Dr. Ibram X. Kendi. The anti-Israel and anti-Semitic streak in Woke activism isn't some weird outgrowth. It's a significant part of the project. pic.twitter.com/wFhYsMr0oB[8] — James Lindsay, knows kung fu (@ConceptualJames) July 14, 2020[9] Ilhan Omar snags Pelosi endorsement, but falls behind in fundraising[10] House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has lent her considerable political weight to the reelection bid of Rep. Ilhan Omar, who has faced allegations of invoking anti-Semitism.Meanwhile , an opponent in the Democrat primary who has attracted the support of pro-Israel givers nationwide has outraised Omar by millions of dollars.'Ilhan is a valued and important Member of our Caucus,' Pelosi said Tuesday in a statement. 'In her first term, Ilhan has already established herself as a leader on a host of issues — from child nutrition to housing to US-Africa relations.'Pelosi was among Democrats in 2019 who joined in criticizing Omar for a number of statements about pro-Israel influence that were seen as anti-Semitic. Omar apologized for some but not all of the statements.Antone Melton-Meaux, one of four Democrats challenging Omar in the August 11 primary for Minnesota's 5th congressional district, has fundraised nationally in part by rebuking Omar for her stances on Israel, including support for boycotts of the Jewish state.The Minneapolis Star Tribune reported Tuesday that Melton-Meaux had raised $3.2 million in the last quarter while Omar had brought in $472,000. Ilhan Omar's Payments to Husband's Firm Hit $1 Million in 2020 Cycle[11] Rep. Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.) continues to dish out six-figure payments to her husband's firm, which has now received more than $1 million from her campaign this cycle.Federal Election Commission records released Tuesday afternoon show that Omar's campaign funneled $228,384.93 last quarter to the E Street Group, a D.C.-based consulting firm run by the congresswoman's husband, Tim Mynett. The payments, predominantly for digital and fundraising services, bring the total that Omar's campaign has sent to Mynett's firm to just over $1 million for the 2020 cycle.Omar, a freshmen congresswoman, has faced scrutiny over numerous financial and personal issues since she was elected in 2018. She has drawn criticism for a lack of transparency about her previous marriages, over campaign finance violations, and for a potential violation of House ethics rules pertaining to the advance she received on a recently published memoir. Pressed for answers, she has routinely dismissed the inquiries as ""smears"" and ""conspiracy theories.""Mynett's firm is the top vendor for Omar's campaign, which doled out $521,000 between April 1 and June 30 with Mynett's share accounting for 44 percent of that total.The financial relationship between Mynett and Omar began before the two announced they were married this March, but it is unclear how long the two were romantically linked before they tied the knot. Omar denied the two were romantically involved, but Mynett's then-wife alleged in divorce papers that the two were having an affair.University of York adopts International Definition of Antisemitism[12] The University of York has reportedly adopted the International Definition of Antisemitism.Campaign Against Antisemitism has long urged widespread adoption of the Definition. The UK was the first country in the world to adopt the International Definition, something for which Campaign Against Antisemitism and Lord Pickles worked hard over many meetings with officials at Downing Street.In recent months, other universities, including the University of Bristol and University College London also adopted the Definition, while the University of Warwick is mired in controversy for refusing to do so.The development follows a call on universities to adopt the International Definition by the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government.California Board of Education Urged to Reject Campaign to Impose Ethnic Studies Curriculum Viewed as Antisemitic[13] Eighty-eight Jewish and pro-Israel groups have expressed concern in a letter over a campaign to subvert the California Department of Education's approval process and institute an ethnic studies program viewed by many as antisemitic.Members of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Advisory Committee (ESMCAC) are pushing for the adoption of a draft ethnic studies model curriculum accused of political bias, which California Governor Gavin Newsom called 'deeply offensive' and Board of Education President Linda Darling-Hammond said needed to be 'substantially redesigned.'Last year, the California state legislature's Jewish Caucus charged that the proposed curriculum 'erases the American Jewish experience, fails to discuss antisemitism, reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, singles out Israel for criticism, and would institutionalize the teaching of antisemitic stereotypes in our public schools.'Tuesday's letter to Darling-Hammond said, 'The Save CA Ethnic Studies campaign has promulgated a plethora of misinformation and sown a great deal of confusion among school board members and school district residents. We therefore urge you to issue an official statement pointing out the misguided and premature nature of these resolutions and urging district school board members to wait until the state's revision process is completed before affirming support for the high school ethnic studies model curriculum or considering whether and how to implement it in their district.'Institutional Antisemitism: Non-Profit's Tweet Shows Scope of Jew-Hatred[14] In a social media climate riddled with antisemitic messages from personalities such as DeSean Jackson and Ice Cube, it's easy to overlook hate speech from sources that aren't as high-profile. As is often the case, however, the prejudice that flies under the radar is just as vile as the rest — and perhaps even more dangerous.Consider the UK-based organization Muslim Public Affairs Committee (MPACUK), which recently tweeted a message touting notoriously bigoted academic Norman Finkelstein and his book The Holocaust Industry, a virulently antisemitic work whose claims include allegations that Jews use the Holocaust as a cynical scheme aimed at stifling purportedly legitimate criticism of Israel.The anti-Zionist Finkelstein, who is Jewish and in the past has referred to relatives of his who were murdered during the Holocaust, has a large following of far-left and far-right bigots who leverage his religion and experiences to 'disprove' the fact that Zionism is a viable, non-racist ideology.The MPACUK's Twitter message — which also retweeted a video of Finkelstein chastising a Jewish Zionist at a University of Waterloo event — included this text:Florida State University Student Senate, Led by President Accused of Antisemitism, Filibusters Resolution Defending Jewish Students[15] A Florida State University student government resolution that sought to combat antisemitism and ensure the empowerment of Jewish students on campus was successfully filibustered last week by the Student Senate, whose president has himself been accused of antisemitism.Ahmad Daraldik — who is Palestinian-American — recently replaced the previous president of the Student Senate who was expelled for criticizing the Black Lives Matter movement.It was later discovered that Daraldik had made numerous offensive comments online, such as 'stupid Jew' and 'f**k Israel.' In addition, a web page belonging to Daraldik openly minimizes the Holocaust, calling it simply an 'atrocity' and comparing Israel unfavorably to Nazi Germany.A bid to remove Daraldik gained a majority vote, but fell short of the two-thirds majority required.In response, Jewish students and their allies pushed Resolution #59, which called for the appointment of a student liaison to 'increase Jewish communication and representation' in student government, requiring education in 'Jewish culture and antisemitism through communication with the Jewish community on campus,' and the creation of a task force to deal with issues facing Jewish students on campus.Winnipeg Free Press Commentator Wrongly Claims Jesus Was Palestinian[16] It's undisputed that Jesus was a Jew born in the land of Judea who lived in the Galilee. In fact, Jesus would never have even heard the word 'Palestine', a Roman word implemented to erase Jewish history.The imperialist term 'Palestine' was coined by the Romans after they destroyed Jerusalem's Holy Temple, crucified thousands, and exiled the Jewish people from their ancestral homeland. The Romans named the area 'Palestina' after the Philistines, one of many ancient adversaries who sought to wipe the Jews off the map. The Arab people only took the areas in question seven hundred years after Jesus' death.Even the anti-Israel New York Times issued a correction recently for claiming that Jesus was a Palestinian Jew: 'Because of an editing error, an article last Saturday referred incorrectly to Jesus's background. While he lived in an area that later came to be known as Palestine, Jesus was a Jew who was born in Bethlehem.'Make no mistake, Jesus did not identify as a Palestinian or as an Arab as present-day Palestinians do, and any efforts to claim to the contrary, serves to de-Judaize Jesus.Studies find far-right using Telegram, ISIS using Facebook[17] The social media platform Telegram is being used by far-right extremists to promote hate and violence against Jews, blacks and law enforcement, according to a new study by the Simon Wiesenthal Center.Wiesenthal Center officials indicated that much of their real-time research has been shared with the Department of Justice, Homeland Security and the FBI. The center urged Telegram to introduce clear and comprehensive policy guidelines to stop the proliferation of hate, extremism and terrorism on its social-media platform.'Our researchers found that far-right channels on Telegram are used to glorify terrorist actors and movements, including the murderers of Jews and Muslims at prayer,' Wiesenthal Center associate dean Rabbi Abraham Cooper said. 'The sharing of harmful material and incitement to lone-wolf violence regularly occurs on these channels.'The study cited research by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a London-based think tank, which found that Telegram channels associated with white supremacy and racism grew by more than 6,000 users during March.The think tank released a study on Monday that found a pro-ISIS account network on Facebook consisting of several hundred accounts and reaching audiences in the tens of thousands.ADL Offers up to $10,000 Reward for Those Tied to Anti-Semitic Attack in Brooklyn[18] The New York Police Department is investigating a possible bias-crime attack against a Jewish man on Saturday, and now the Anti-Defamation League is offering a reward to help catch the assailants.According to NYPD spokesman Det. Hubert Reyes, the 51-year-old victim was walking down a street in Brooklyn, N.Y., on July 11 when occupants in a blue SUV began yelling anti-Semitic slurs at him. The victim answered them back, and 'two men in the vehicle stepped out and punched the victim in the head.The assailants drove off while the victim walked to a nearby hospital, where he was treated for a laceration to his head and a broken finger on his right hand.'We are alarmed and deeply disturbed that another violent anti-Semitic incident has occurred in Brooklyn,' said Etzion Neuer, interim regional director of the New York/New Jersey ADL. 'This is horrific, and the hate must stop. The fact that this alleged attack took place during the Sabbath makes it even more egregious.'The ADL is offering a reward of up to $10,000 information leading to the arrest and conviction of the attackers.Even though it has a large and heavily Orthodox Jewish population, Brooklyn is no stranger to anti-Semitic incidents.German regional police chief forced out over force's far-right links[19] The police chief in the German state of Hesse on Tuesday resigned over suspected far-right links in the regional force he was heading.Udo Muench took early retirement after it emerged that police computers were used in unauthorized searches for details of two prominent personalities, including a far-left politician, who subsequently received threatening letters and emails.The messages were signed 'NSU 2.0,' a reference to the German neo-Nazi cell National Socialist Underground that committed a string of racist murders in the 2000s.While far-right extremism was once thought to plague mostly eastern states, Hesse was shaken last year by the murder of pro-migrant politician Walter Luebke at the hands of a neo-Nazi.It was also in a city in the region — Hanau — where a man gunned down nine people of foreign origin in February this year.The row entangling Hesse's police force came as German law enforcement services are under close scrutiny over far-right extremism in their midst, a debate that has also been amplified by the Black Lives Matter protests in the United States. Kent Police investigate far-right stickers with phrases like 'Hitler was right' just weeks after CAA revealed how similar stickers were appearing in the area[20] Kent Police are investigating far-right stickers with phrases such as 'Hitler was right', 'they lied about Hitler' and 'national socialist now', just weeks after Campaign Against Antisemitism reported that similar stickers appeared in the area.The new graffiti was found in Cliftonville and Dane Valley in the first week of July.The report comes soon after members of the proscribed National Action group were sentenced to prison, having engaged, amongst other activities, in far-right stickering and recruitment campaigns.At the time, Campaign Against Antisemitism commented that we have monitored and reported on far-right stickering operations, including on university campuses, for a long time, including by the new far-right Hundred Handers group. We continue to call on the authorities to take action against these seemingly low-level incidents, including because they are gateways into more heinous and dangerous activity.Israeli-Made Drones to Help Rescue Operations in Northern Norway[21] Swarms of Israeli-made drones will patrol the arctic skies of Norway to help the country's rescue services in cases of emergencies in remote locations. After a year of trials, Israeli manufacturer Atlas Dynamics has signed a contract with Norwegian People's Aid (NPAID), one of the world's top arctic rescue units for its Atlas Pro drones, designed to operate in extreme cold conditions for hours at a time.The drones are equipped with artificial intelligence and distributed communication systems that enable them to operate as a swarm and independently from their human operator and transmit the information in real-time to the rescue forces.The MESH technology will allow rescue crews to quickly scan large territories to locate those in need of rescue, which in the case of the northern Norwegian terrain made up of rugged mountains, glaciers, and fjords, usually means adventurous hikers. The drones will replace manned helicopters currently used for such missions.According to the company, Atlas Dynamics and the Norwegian rescue organization plan to develop more shared products later this year that will assist in rescue operations next winter.Atlas Dynamics was founded in 2016 by Ivan Tolchinsky — who serves as CEO — Guy Cherni (CMO), and Omri Cherni (COO). The company has offices in Tel Aviv, the UK, the US, and Latvia. According to data on PitchBook, the company raised a total of $8 million in funding .Former Google Exec Launches Israel's First Investment Fund Dedicated to Gaming[22] Eitan Reisel launched on Wednesday VGames, the first games-focused investment fund out of Israel. The first-of-its-kind fund has already raised $30 million, which it will invest solely in games studios in Israel and parts of eastern Europe.Reisel, a former Google executive and naval officer, was introduced to the world of gaming in 2013 when he led the games division in the large tech company. After several years, he left to focus on building the first investment fund dedicated to the companies operating out of Israel.'Israel is an unbelievable gaming industry,' said Reisel, speaking exclusively to CTech. 'There are amazing companies that grow here, unicorns and multi-million dollar companies. I wanted to support the new generation.' He explains that Israel's data-driven economy environment coincides nicely with programmers' abilities to keep people tapping on their phones.The gaming industry is one of the most lucrative industries in the world, with 2020 projecting revenues of more than $4 billion in Israel alone. With millions of people spending a lot of time this year in quarantine, those figures are only expected to rise as people continue to stay at home.VGames will be investing in the pre-seed and seed stages for gaming studios. It already has a portfolio of four gaming studios, including InnPlay Labs and Brain Games. Citing success stories such as Miniclip and Playtika, Reisel has high hopes: 'Israel is becoming the global leader in games. Aside from cyber security, you don't see as much success with unicorns and multi-billion dollar companies under one category.'Solar-Powered Transmitters to Warn Israeli Drivers of Camels on the Road[23] Ayman El-Sayed and Yoav Ludmer have found a technological solution for the deadly danger of camels roaming the roads of Israel's Negev desert region. There have been several accidents involving camels and cars over recent years, with several people losing their lives and dozens being injured.Every camel currently carries an ID tag that identifies its owner in case the camel is lost or involved in an accident. El-Sayed and Ludmer, who teamed up at Startup Negev, a new tech accelerator catering to Israel's Bedouin minority, created a system based on radio signals. Every camel will receive a solar-powered collar that will transmit its location. As soon as the camel comes within 100 meters of a road or rail track, GPS users will receive an automatic notification, for example via the Waze application, allowing the driver to slow down and be ready for the hazard.The project is about to enter the pilot stage during which an antenna will be set up at the entrance to Bedouin city Rahat capable of detecting transmissions from nine kilometers away.'The goal of this initiative is to monitor wandering farm animals and prevent car accidents,' said El-Sayed. 'We are here to protect the lives of the camels and of the drivers and raise the awareness of the different dangers that exist on the road.'Ludmer is the CEO and founder of communications company SMBIT.Gideon Shavit, chairman of Advanced Technology Center (Mata) and the entrepreneur behind Startup Negev, said: 'The goal of this project is to encourage the Bedouin community across the Negev to join Israel's tech entrepreneurs.'Masa's new program offering allows fellows to work remotely from Israel[24] Masa Israel Journey, an umbrella organization for long-term experiences in Israel, is offering a new program for young professionals titled Masa Remote Israel.The premise is that the fellows would move to Tel Aviv for four months, while working their current jobs in their home country. Throughout that time, they would participate in Masa's educational and social program schedule - which will be fixed around the fellow's current job and time zone, so that they are able to get in a full working day.The cost of the program is around $1,780 per month, however, Masa usually awards scholarships to those requesting, which would normally covers rent as well as in some cases minimal program costs.The program is geared towards post-college graduates under the age of 30, from English-speaking countries such as the United States, Canada or the UK.Second Temple period Jewish ritual bath uncovered, in need of rescuing[25] A Second Temple period Jewish ritual bath was discovered by chance last month in the Lower Galilee and a group of locals are trying to save it from its current destiny of destruction.The 2,000-year-old facility was revealed during a salvage excavation by the Israel Antiquities Authority in preparation for construction works of a new highway intersection near Kibbutz Hannaton.Construction projects in Israel are required by law to be preceded by an archeological survey. However, considering the density of the country's territory both in terms of population and of ancient remains, when researchers find something, in most cases they just document it and move as much as possible out of harm's way before the works continue. The newly discovered mikve is set to represent no lucky exception and is set to buried again by the highway within a few weeks.However, some Hannaton residents are hoping to be able to transfer the whole structure to the kibbutz and to create a small archaeological park around it. The mission especially resonated with them also because Hannaton is already home to a very special ritual bath, the only one in Israel that is open to anyone wishes to experience it regardless of religion, sex or age, as explained to The Jerusalem Post by Anat Harrel, a tour guide and a member of the kibbutz's mikve committee.'A few weeks ago, I participated into a tour visit of the ancient ritual bath organized by the IAA, which runs many initiatives to bring the public to archaeological excavations,' she said. 'After learning that the mikve is going to be covered in cement I asked if it would be possible for us to build a replica for the kibbutz. The archaeologists actually suggested moving the whole thing.'Once determined that the move would be possible logistically, the question has become to find the necessary funds. For this purpose, Harrel, together with Rabbi Haviva Ner-David who runs the mikve in the kibbutz, and Steve Gray, another resident, launched a fundraising campaign to collect the $75,000 necessary for the first phase of the project.https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/t_JD_ArticleMainImageFaceDetect/460625;Play Video[26] We have lots of ideas, but we need more resources to be even more effective.

[Editor's Note: This is the third and final installment of articles covering The Gatepost's 2020 political survey. The other two articles covered student views on the election and current political topics. You can read the other two articles on fsugatepost.com.]
In an unscientific survey conducted by The Gatepost from Oct. 5 to Oct. 15, students said they supported the Black Lives Matter Movement and were concerned about police misconduct and white supremacy movements.
Three-hundred students participated in the survey.
Approximately 92% percent of Gatepost student survey respondents said they support the Black Lives Matter Movement.
Approximately 93% of Gatepost survey respondents said they were concerned about instances of police misconduct. Additionally, 66% of respondents said they support redirecting police funding to social services programs.
Approximately 82% of survey respondents said they were worried about the rise of white supremacy movements in the U.S.
Approximately 92% of survey respondents said systemic racism impacts the United States.
Rep. Jack Lewis, a Democrat representing Ashland and a portion of the City of Framingham, said, ""I'm very impressed that the great majority - nearly 92% - of Framingham State students support the Black Lives Matter Movement.
""In a perfect world, this would be 100%,"" he added. ""But as we are reminded - and as shown on our TVs every evening on the nightly news - while we have made great progress in civil rights and great progress toward true racial justice and equity, the work continues.""
Constanza Cabello, vice president of diversity, inclusion, and community engagement, said, ""As a campus, we've said Black lives matter. We've affirmed that systemic racism is a reality.""
Cabello added Framingham State has made anti-racism ""mission critical,"" and said, ""That's central to our values.""
She added that nationally, people are viewing this year as a ""twin-demic. COVID-19 and the ongoing killing of black and brown bodies, and that's really impacted everything,"" she said.
Cabello said one of the most important actions the community can take to confront racism is to ""meet free speech with more free speech.""
Lorretta Holloway, vice president for enrollment and student development, said of all the information gathered in the 2020 Gatepost survey, she was least surprised that most of the student respondents support the Black Lives Matter Movement.
Holloway specifically referenced the racist acts of 2017 as an example of bias incidents that have occurred on campus.
""It [the racist incidents on campus] hits home in many ways for people,"" she added.
Black Lives Matter Movement
Of the 300 Gatepost student survey respondents, 275, 91.7%, said they support the Black Lives Matter Movement, and 25, 8.3%, do not.
Many FSU students shared why they support the Black Lives Matter Movement.
Some survey respondents replied by saying, ""Black Lives Matter,"" but did not provide any more of an explanation.
One survey respondent said, ""No lives matter until Black lives matter. I agree very strongly with the movement, and I think the police in America need to be defunded and have the funds go to other problems.""
Taylor Anderson, a senior English major, said, ""People need to stop ignoring what makes them uncomfortable. BLM should not just be a trend where people post a black square one week and forget about it the next.
""Movements require constant action. People need to vote, stand up for others, educate themselves, advocate for reform,"" she added.
Co-president of M.I.S.S. Mariah Farris said she thinks the Black Lives Matter Movement has received more attention due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
""It was the one thing I think COVID made a thing because everybody was trapped in their house,"" she said. ""Everybody had the news. It was on TV and on every channel. It was on social media. There was no getting away from it.""
Farris added, ""I think for the first time in a long time, or first time ever in my opinion, white people are actually seeing firsthand on the screen something that they haven't come to terms with or haven't seen before.""
Samantha Collette, president of the class of 2022, said, ""I do think students care about the BLM Movement, as reflected in The Gatepost survey results. Those responses further show that when racial incidents occur on our campus, they come from a very specific group of people and it does not reflect how the community feels toward people of color.""
Collette added, ""It also seems like the general University response is reactive and not preventative, as if they send out emails to reach out but it's only because bad things happened.""
Phoenix Harris, president of the Black Student Union , said, ""I think that everybody, no matter how vocal or active they are, can always do more.""
Harris said the Sociology and Psychology departments have been very vocal and supportive in the movement, but others not as much. ""They [other departments] could do a lot more to bring attention to what we feel is important.""
Cameron Duffy, a junior psychology major, said, ""I am surprised about the number of people who don't support the BLM Movement just because of the demographics that are present at Framingham State.""
However, some survey respondents said they were hesitant to support the Black Lives Matter Movement.
One Gatepost survey respondent said, ""Being a Black individual myself, I agree with the BLM statement, but not what they are trying to achieve through the movement.
""It counteracts that Black lives matter, and they pick and choose what they are for,"" they added.
Another survey respondent said, ""I support the message BLM is trying to send, but disagree with the organization's approach.""
Additionally, another Gatepost survey respondent said the Black Lives Matter Movement is no longer representing its original mission.
""I feel that the Black Lives Matter Movement has been corrupted and people are no longer vouching for the improvement of Black lives in this country, but instead are politicizing the movement to further their own interests,"" they said.
Ariana Nunez, vice president of Brother to Brother (B2B), said sometimes, she is worried about discussing her support for the Black Lives Matter Movement. ""If I want to bring it up to someone I don't know, it's scary because I don't know how they're going to react.
""I feel like I have to keep my guard up because I don't know everybody here - I'm meeting new people every day,"" she added.
Tara Donovan, a junior English major, said she supports the Black Lives Matter Movement, but is concerned with its portrayal in the media.
""I'm worried about how they're reporting on that stuff,"" she said. ""A lot of people will get the wrong idea of what Black Lives Matter means. I think people are getting the idea that young kids are rioting.""
Another Gatepost survey respondent said, ""I support Black lives and know they're in danger, but I refuse to support a movement that condones violence toward businesses and innocent people.""
Sociology Professor Virginia Rutter said people who are less informed about these issues are likely to be more hesitant about supporting the Black Lives Matter Movement.
""This [hesitation to support the BLM Movement] has to do with a lack of information, a lack of the provision of enough support for understanding that Black Lives Matter is a simple and core premise that takes nothing from anyone else and only gives us all the best that's possible,"" she said.
Criminology Professor Xavier Guadalupe-Diaz said, ""What we're experiencing right now with the movement for Black lives is a culmination of centuries of systemic white supremacist marginalization in the U.S., which was compounded by layers of crises happening here and around the world.""
He noted the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as ""a crippled economy, the erosion of democratic norms in U.S. institutions, and the rise of populist authoritarianism,"" as crises.
Police Misconduct
The Gatepost survey also found 279 students, 93%, were concerned about incidents of police brutality, while 21, 7%, were not.
Several Gatepost survey respondents stated they were dissatisfied with President Donald J. Trump's approach to the recent incidents of police misconduct.
One survey respondent said, ""It is highly concerning to me the way Trump has handled racial injustice and police brutality situations recently.""
This survey respondent added, ""I can't in good conscience vote for a racist president.""
Another Gatepost survey respondent said, ""I understand 'All lives matter' or 'Not all police officers are bad,' but we need to care for Black lives because they do not choose to be the race they are.
""They are born being Black, while police officers put themselves in these situations,"" they said. ""We must care for all lives, but most importantly, Black lives right now!""
Lidia Flores, co-president of Latinos Unidos N' Accion , said, ""Everything is based off the color of your skin. My parents every day have to worry about being pulled over because of the color of their skin.
""Not only is it the white police officers - it's your fellow Hispanics and African Americans, too,"" she said. ""It's sad someone has to fear when they see a cop. One shouldn't have to fear those who are there to protect us.""
Another survey respondent said, ""I believe that police brutality is a thing and that POC [people of color] have become targeted victims of police brutality because of the systemic racism in our country.""
BSU president Harris said the police and justice system's actions are going to be difficult to fix and what the nation is currently doing is not enough.
""We are going to have to figure out something else to do, because what we're doing is not working,"" she said.
Spencer Lezin, a junior business management major, said, ""It's honestly really sad how we cannot fully trust people who are supposed to protect us.""
M.I.S.S. co-president Ewine Fedna said people of color's fear of police is not new.
""Before Trump's presidency, the fear of cops was there, but it was never every day when you got into the car and prayed that you got home,"" she said.
B2B Vice President Nunez said, ""Obviously, police brutality has been a thing for ages, but I feel like now, after COVID, things are really being brought to light.""
While many of the survey respondents said they supported at least some funding from police departments being redirected to support social services programs, a small number said they were against the idea.
One Gatepost survey respondent said, ""I'm concerned about police brutality, but a whole group of people should not be condemned for a few bad apples. That goes for any party, race, job, or group.""
Brad Medeiros, chief of the Framingham State University Police Department , said while they are not allowed to comment on political activity, FSUPD remains committed to supporting diversity within the community.
He said in the past year, FSUPD officers have received extensive diversity training in areas such as preventing and responding to hate crimes, managing bias, diversity and inclusion in the modern workplace, mental health first aid (including police interactions), criminal justice reform, de-escalation training, fair and impartial policing, and First Amendment rights.
Medeiros added, ""The University Police Department is committed to continuous improvement, to ensuring that our training reflects best practices.
""We will continue to review recommendations - both nationally and locally - to identify areas for enhancing our policies and training,"" he added.
Police Funding
Of the 300 Gatepost survey respondents, 229 students, 76.3%, said they support some police funding being redirected to support social services programs, 36, 12%, said they do not, and 35, 11.7%, said they were unsure.
Rep. Lewis said, ""I'm optimistic that we, as a local community, but also as a nation, are going to find a way to move forward in a way that ensures that our communities are [not only] safe, but that those of us with family members of color and friends of color don't have to worry about the possibility that a speeding ticket for our Black sons could lead to a death sentence.""
Several Gatepost survey respondents said they support the national movement for defunding the police.
Undeclared freshman Gustavo Pazi said, ""Too much strength is being given to them in the form of new high-end equipment, and leniency in rules against them has made it so they have free rein to do whatever they want to the citizens that they're supposed to protect.
""Defunding the police is definitely the correct course we should take, but I also feel it wouldn't be enough in the long run,"" he added. ""We should be defunding the police and the military at the same time.""
LUNA co-president Flores said, ""Defunding the police can help the community and help each other, because the police are not helping us.
""Being from a low-income city myself, it is the best solution to help our community grow and get better,"" she said.
Eddy Olu, a junior computer science major, said, ""Recently, my city has poured money into new police squad cars, but there are some potholes that have been on certain streets that have been there since I was a child.""
He added, ""Putting money into fixing streets and actually progressing cities would be a nice first step.""
Tadiwa Chitongo, a junior biochemistry major, said, ""The police need to be defunded. The money needs to be going to extracurricular activities and making sure that children have places to spend their time and go for help in case they need it.""
He recommended art programs, shelters, and orphanages as other places to reallocate funding.
Elizabeth Dollard, a sophomore elementary education major, said, ""I do believe that some of the excessive funding could be reallocated to different parts of the community. My main belief is that education could desperately use some of these funds.
""Otherwise, I think some of the funds the law enforcement profession have could be used instead to fund training to further enforce how to avoid excessive force,"" Dollard added.
Another Gatepost survey respondent said, ""While I believe in the Black Lives Matter Movement, I do not believe the police should be defunded in hopes that it will stop police brutality.
""I believe that instead, the funds should be used to buy nondeadly weapons to replace guns and [fund] training in ways to bring in a suspect safely so that way everyone feels safe,"" they added.
FSU President F. Javier Cevallos said, ""One thing that we have to be more nuanced about is what defunding the police means.
""You do need to have, obviously, police security. Not everybody is a good citizen and not everybody is going to behave,"" he added. ""So, that word 'defunding' tends to be misinterpreted.""
Cevallos said the police should invest in social programs, training, and different kinds of activities, ""especially community policing.
""That is different than just taking money away from the police. And I think that people react strongly one way or [another] for the police. If somebody tries to break into my house, I want to have a police officer around,"" Cevallos added.
History Professor Jon Huibregtse compared the United States' police force funding to that of other countries.
""It is my understanding that in countries where they have redirected money into social services and into kinds of preventative programming, crime has declined,"" he said.
Vice President Holloway said she encourages people to talk about why police have become militarized instead of putting that money toward more intense training programs.
Holloway said the question that should be asked is why police funds are going toward ""excess military supplies"" rather than services such as mental health and community policing.
She also acknowledged police forces often receive a larger portion of the budget than public schools, community aid programs, and in some cases, fire departments.
She said she believes ""defund the police"" is ""a fear-inducing term.""
White Supremacy Movements
Of the Gatepost survey respondents, 245 students, 81.7%, said they were concerned about the rise of white supremacy movements in the U.S., and 55, 18.3%, said they were not.
Student Trustee McKenzie Ward said she was surprised to see 18.3% of respondents were not worried about the rise of white supremacy groups.
""In recent years, we have seen more hate crimes occurring and we have seen literal Nazi parades occur in our country,"" she said. ""It makes me worried that people are not paying enough attention to what is going on in the world.""
Rep. Lewis said the rise of white supremacy ""should be a concern to everyone.""
He added, ""We have a moral obligation to make sure that everyone, regardless of their political affiliation, from law enforcement all the way through to the elected leaders - from local mayors all the way up to the president - denounce these movements.""
Lewis referenced President Trump's remarks at the first presidential debate.
""Hearing the president during the first presidential debate this year telling the Proud Boys group to 'stand by' was alarming and concerning, and, for those who paid attention, a clear sign of where his heart truly is as it relates to justice and equity,"" he said.
According to The New York Times, the Proud Boys is a far-right group that is known for endorsing violence. The group describes itself as a ""pro-western fraternal organization for men,"" and has been tied to violent incidents at protests.
Mia Ihegie, a junior political science major and president of Justice, Unity, Inclusion, Community, Equity (J.U.I.C.E.), said, ""I learned that no matter how many visuals you can give, or facts you can put in people's faces, ignorance is something that can't be healed.
""I personally feel that ignorance is a disease that no one is looking for a cure. The ignorant will stay ignorant until they are ready to learn,"" she added.
Nicholas Miranda, a junior marketing major, said, ""I absolutely think that white supremacy needs to be addressed. With the number of people supporting the All Lives Matter Movement, it's clear that there are plenty of people who have white supremacist mindsets ingrained within themselves.""
One survey respondent said they find it very troubling to see the rise of white supremacy movements in the U.S.
""I feel like our country is in a huge battle with ourselves,"" they said.
Carmen McLaughlin, a senior history major, said, ""This is something that should have been addressed way before today."" She added it's not right that in 2020, people still have to be afraid of ""far-right groups like the KKK.""
One Gatepost survey respondent said, ""I think racism and white supremacy have always been in this country. I think that Trump's position as president has made racists and white supremacists more vocal.""
Vice President Holloway said white supremacy movements have been around since ""at least the birth of the KKK.
""The current political climate has allowed them [white supremacist groups] to have more of a voice and more influence.""
She added, ""The joining of forces between many of these groups with armed militia groups should cause concern for everyone, not just BIPOC [Black, Indigenous, and people of color] who live here.""
Professor Guadalupe-Diaz said the most troubling part about the rise of white supremacy to him is that they [hate groups] have become increasingly ""emboldened and normalized.
""What we are seeing now is this growing militia movement that has, historically, facilitated major acts of domestic terrorism and mass violence,"" he added.
He said people need to be more ""vigilant"" about how authority figures normalize white supremacy.
Education and Faculty-led Initiatives
Many Gatepost survey respondents, as well as students, professors, and administrators interviewed by The Gatepost, discussed the need for more education within the FSU community to address incidents of racial bias.
Vice President Cabello said education is essential to combating racial injustice.
""It's really up to us to create opportunities for education, but also opportunities for multiple voices to be heard,"" she said.
Cabello said the Bias Education Response Team (B.E.R.T.) is one of those on-campus resources for bias education.
She said, ""A lot of times, people think we're [B.E.R.T.] just a response team.
""But, we have been doing prevention and education, too,"" she added.
Cabello said while she feels good about the work the University has undertaken, the biggest challenge it faces is that it is going to take ""a lot of time"" to undo systemic racism.
Several students said they were dissatisfied with certain offices' approaches to educating the community about racial inequality.
President of J.U.I.C.E. Ihegie said she believes FSU should employ professors who are willing to teach what is happening in the ""current political climate.
""Not everyone is going to see the survey. Not everyone is going to hear about a Black Lives Matter event. Not everyone is going to hear the things they [Framingham State administrators] are promoting,"" she added.
Ihegie said one way the FSU community can promote anti-racism education is for the University to hold more programs - in the classroom and out - to educate students.
SGA Secretary Lexi Kays said she believes the University ""should be talking more.
""I feel as though individual departments are handling it well on social media, but the University as a whole sent a couple of emails back at the height of everything in June but hasn't mentioned much since,"" said Kays.
She said she wants all students to feel safe and comfortable on campus regardless of their race or ethnicity.
Senior English major Taylor Anderson said, ""In addition to protests, we should definitely educate ourselves more on these issues.""
Class of 2022 President Samantha Collette said, ""On campus, it seems like some departments and offices care more than others.""
Collette specifically said she sees the Dean's Office, New Student and Family Programs, and Residence Life using social media to provide material and resources about racial bias and equity.
She added she does not see this kind of action being taken by other offices on campus.
Professor Huibregtse said he believes FSU has done a lot to combat racism, but knows there is still work to be done.
""From a faculty perspective, I know we're trying,"" he said. ""Is that to say we've solved the issue? Absolutely not. Can we do more? Absolutely yes! People are trying, and we probably need to try harder in some instances.""
English Professor Kelly Matthews said, ""Students are really leading in terms of advocacy against racism.""
She added the Faculty Against Hate group was inspired by the students who protested in 2017 after racial incidents in residence halls and said there needs to be an ongoing conversation between students and professors to address racial issues.
""We, as professors, need to share power across that student-professor division, and we need to open up to examining, acknowledging, and addressing those power disparities - especially the ways in which they show up around racism and ethnicity,"" Matthews said.
She encouraged students to ""keep speaking out and speaking up"" about racial inequity.

74,/content/Bias_Crime_Lexis_1.DOCX,Newstex Blogs,2020-12-29,4317 words,,,,2020's most defining stories in Syracuse,False,"Dec 29, 2020( The Daily Orange: http://www.dailyorange.com Delivered by Newstex) The Daily Orange is a nonprofit newsroom that receives no funding from Syracuse University. Considerdonating[1]today to support our mission. In a year with a never-ending news cycle, it can be hard to recall the important moments that defined Syracuse in 2020. COVID-19 made its way onto campus and into Onondaga County. Protests expanded on and around Syracuse University's campus to advocate against racial inequality. An SU alumnus was even elected to the White House. Those are the big ones. But what else impacted Syracuse in a year of uncertainty and unrest? The Daily Orange highlighted some of the most important stories of 2020, chronicled by the writers and editors who covered them. Here are our picks. 
http://s3.amazonaws.com/dailyorange/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/28212020/BIDEN-WINS-FINAL.png Nabeeha Anwar | Presentation DirectorSyracuse University alumnus Joe Biden elected as president[2]President-elect Joe Biden is set to become the first SU alumnus to serve as president of the United States. The former vice president's win came four days after Election Day as the country waited for states to count massive volumes of mail-in ballots. Biden eventually prevailed over President Donald Trump with over 300 electoral votes and victories in key battleground states, including Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. Biden's running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), will be the first woman, first Black person and first Asian American to serve as vice president. While Biden graduated from SU's College of Law in 1968, he's still maintained connections with the university and has visited campus several times throughout his political career. He delivered a commencement address to the College of Law in 2006 and 2016. He also served as a keynote speaker at SU's 2009 commencement ceremony. Biden's late son, Beau Biden, who died of brain cancer in May 2015, also graduated from SU's College of Law in 1994 and delivered the college's commencement address in 2011.

Students packed the Quad, throwing footballs and gathering in groups, because a nice day in early March is almost unheard of in Syracuse. A week later, that same Quad would be deserted, the quiet center of a campus evacuated in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. While unprecedented, the news of SU's transition to online classes didn't arrive without warning. After an initial announcement by Chancellor Kent Syverud that SU would transition to online classes until at least March 30, faculty began speculating that SU would soon follow other colleges and move courses online indefinitely. The decision came a few days later. Eight months after that, a near-identical story occurred again as SU's in-person fall semester crumbled in its final stretch. That time, though, the announcement was prompted by ever-increasing case numbers and swelling quarantine totals on campus and across Onondaga County. As for the spring semester, SU has not yet made a final decision on whether it will hold in-person classes. 'We have to be ready to change course depending on the conditions at the time,' Syverud said on Dec. 9[4]. 'Our goal does remain to begin the spring semester on Jan. 25.'

At Syracuse, the football team played its full schedule in the fall without any real hiccups, but the men's basketball season got off to quite the rocky start when one of the most famous people in central New York tested positive. Head coach Jim Boeheim, 76, experienced mild symptoms, completed his isolation period at home and coached SU in its season-opener versus Bryant. His positive test foreshadowed how fragile Syracuse's season is. Since Boeheim tested positive, a walk-on was diagnosed with COVID-19 and Buddy Boeheim missed multiple games due to contact tracing. Most recently, SU has had its final two games of 2020 postponed due to COVID-19 protocol after Buffalo players tested positive a day after playing the Orange in the Carrier Dome. Boeheim's view on COVID-19 remains the same as before he contracted the virus: He thinks college basketball should be played through the pandemic with necessary precautions in place. He believes his team is safer with regimented practice schedules, thrice-weekly testing and team doctors on hand than with canceling the 2020-21 season. Danny Emerman http://s3.amazonaws.com/dailyorange/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/28212633/1.23.20_dom.jpg Katie Getman | Senior Staff DesignerAfter almost two dozen reports of hate crimes and bias incidents, 100+ students react[6]Between the final weeks of 2019's fall semester and the beginning of the spring around a two-month span at least 21 hate crimes or bias-related incidents were reported on or near SU's campus. What began as racist graffiti[7] reported on Nov. 7, 2019 within two floors in Day Hall turned into more and more incidents[8]. The incidents sparked student protests at the Barnes Center at The Arch in November 2019 and Crouse-Hinds Hall in the spring from students who demanded change from SU's administration. In between the two sit-ins[9], The D.O. asked more than 100 SU students if they felt safe on campus after winter break and if the university could do more to remedy issues of transparency and safety. In January, students varied in how safe they felt at SU, but many were unsure whether campus-wide change had been made. KJ Edelman http://s3.amazonaws.com/dailyorange/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/28212741/hendricks.jpg Daily Orange File PhotoLarge gathering on Quad becomes national story[10]Less than a week before the start of classes this fall, more than 100 SU students gathered on the Quad, many not wearing masks or practicing social distancing. Department of Public Safety officers, whose Sims Hall headquarters is just feet from the Quad, cleared the area about 45 minutes after the gathering began. SU eventually suspended 23 students in connection to the incident. 'Make no mistake, there was not a single student who gathered on the Quad last night who did not know and understand that it was wrong to do so,' said Mike Haynie, vice chancellor for strategic initiatives and innovation, in an email the day after the gathering. 'Instead, those students knowingly ignored New York State public health law and the provisions of the Syracuse University Stay Safe Pledge.' Michael Sessa http://s3.amazonaws.com/dailyorange/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/28212837/EmmaFolts_ManagingEditor_DOM.jpg Emma Folts | Managing EditorLast Chance for Change organizes to make lasting impact[11]Protests against racism and police brutality erupted across the United States as news of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor's deaths shook the nation in June. Faced again with painful loss and political momentum, organizers in Syracuse rallied in honor of Floyd, Taylor and several others who had died and were part of the local community. The spectrum of both political organization and emotion ranged widely this summer. Syracuse was no exception to this variation and the all-too familiar cases of police brutality. Fifteen local groups, including Last Chance for Change, came together to discuss, plan and protest. Last Chance for Change members marched throughout Syracuse for 40 days. The activists collaborated to present Mayor Ben Walsh with the People's Agenda for Police Reform, a list of demands for police reform Walsh partially agreed to[12] in July. But beyond the hours of chanting and walking, Last Chance for Change organizers devoted time to creating community spaces and events for Syracuse natives. Most protests and public attention for police brutality and racism faded as summer ended, but for many in Syracuse's Black community, the losses and scars remain fresh. Nevertheless, Last Chance for Change's conversation on justice and healing hasn't stopped. Charged with solidarity, the group's organizers are determined to keep the movement and its name in the minds of Syracuse's leaders and community members, they said. Marnie Muñoz http://s3.amazonaws.com/dailyorange/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/28213009/031220_ACC_JordanPhelps_SP_09.jpg Jordan Phelps | Staff PhotographerSyracuse season canceled during ACC tournament, sports cancellationsbegin[13]March 12 will certainly be a date people remember when lookingback on2020. That's when the sports industry halted. But the path to that day when every college conference scrapped all of their winter tournaments and spring seasons started days prior. The College Basketball Invitational and the Ivy League basketball tournaments were both canceled. Syracuse's men's lacrosse game against Rutgers, if it had happened, would've been played without fans in attendance. And everything culminated on March 11 in Greensboro, North Carolina, as Syracuse blew out North Carolina by 28 points in the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament's first round. The bigger picture, though, contained uncertainty about whether there would even be a second round if all those added hand sanitizer stations, extra surface wipe-downs and restricted media protocols could hold off the looming coronavirus threat. They couldn't. Fans flocked to the Greensboro Coliseum on March 11, but by the next afternoon, the ACC tournament had been upended. Hotel pivots and flight adjustments followed for travelers. Canceled tournaments turned into canceled seasons, canceled seasons into canceled offseason workouts. Suddenly, there was no timeline of when sports, collegiate or professional, would return. Andrew Crane http://s3.amazonaws.com/dailyorange/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/28213031/200217_CrouseHinds_CoreyHenry_PE_18_1.jpg Corey Henry | Senior Staff PhotographerSU initially suspends 30 #NotAgainSU organizers during Crouse-Hinds sit-in[14]#NotAgainSU, a movement led by Black students, began occupying Crouse-Hinds Hall on Feb. 17 to further protest the university's response to a series of hate incidents on and near campus. Crouse-Hinds houses the offices of Chancellor Kent Syverud and other university administrators. There were about 50 organizers in the building's lobby when it closed at 9 p.m. At that time, Rob Hradsky, vice president for the student experience, threatened the organizers with interim suspension for violating SU's Code of Student Conduct by remaining inside past closing. About 30 organizers chose to stay inside Crouse-Hinds. As of 12:50 a.m., a DPS officer gave the students letters stating that they were suspended, effective immediately. The movement first held a sit-in at the Barnes Center at The Arch for eight days in November 2019. SU officials did not issue[15] conduct sanctions to the organizers for staying in the facility overnight. Hradsky told an organizer in Crouse-Hinds that the university suspended the rules in that situation. By the morning of Feb. 18, DPS had sealed off Crouse-Hinds, preventing[16] outside food, medicine and resources from entering until the following afternoon. DPS officers at the building's entrances also exhibited hostility[17]to students who wanted to deliver supplies inside. At one point, DPS Deputy Chief John Sardino physically struggled with protesters outside Crouse-Hinds and touched his gun holster. Two days after the start of #NotAgainSU's occupation, Syverud announced that he had lifted[18] the organizer's interim suspensions. SU also misidentified four students who were not[19] at Crouse-Hinds and placed them under interim suspension, prompting accusations of racial profiling[20]. The university rescinded the four conduct charges. Crouse-Hinds reopened Feb. 20. The movement would continue it's occupation for a total of 31 days, becoming one of the longest-running student protests in SU's recent history.

Photo EditorGreek life during COVID-19: No parties, social events at chapter houses[21]SU has been consistently ranked[22] as a top party school[23] by The Princeton Review. During the pandemic, however, fraternity and sorority members at SU returned to campus for a semester devoid of parties and many other social events.Students had to limit gatherings to 25 people and practice social distancing, according to SU's Stay Safe Pledge. Fraternities and sororities also couldn't host registered social events at chapter houses, and access to chapter houses was limited. Prior to the start of the fall semester, members of fraternities and sororities shared their hopes, fears and expectations for what was to come. One student hoped that Greek organizations would learn fromthe Zeta Beta Tau fraternity'ssuspension[24]for allegedly violating public health guidelines at a gathering in April. Another worried that students would still host parties instead of abiding by health guidelines. 'I've heard that a lot of people are very intent on keeping people safe and keeping to themselves, which is very promising to me,' said Adrianne Morales, a member of Delta Delta Delta. 'But at the same time, that doesn't speak for everyone and ultimately, people's actions will speak volumes more than their words.'

Jon Zubieta, a chemistry professor in SU's College of Arts and Sciences, referred to COVID-19 as 'Wuhan Flu' and 'Chinese Communist Party Virus.' While Zubieta did not respond to The D.O.'s request for comment, he later claimed that his use of such language was intended to mock 'PC culture,' and he began working with a free speech group to reinstate himself at SU. Chinese students at SU, some from Wuhan, spoke out against Zubieta's language. Meanwhile, those calling for Zubieta's reinstatement argued that SU's temporary removal of Zubieta was a violation of free speech. 'We will not allow any member of our community to violate the University's commitment to a safe, inclusive and welcoming learning and living environment,' said Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences Karin Ruhlandt and Interim Provost John Liu in a campus-wide email that announced his leave.

The idea for a collective mostly containing former Syracuse athletes stemmed from conversations Tarrant and other founders had following the killings of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd in late spring. Protests over police brutality and systemic racism had started across the country, and Black Oranges' goal was to outline steps for creating change in local communities while fighting for social justice within SU Athletics and the larger university. As of September, Black Oranges had expanded to over 350 members. It's now part of a new task force within SU's athletic departments, one implemented by Salatha Willis, associate athletic director for diversity, culture and climate, after he was hired in July. The collective has also coordinated a social media campaign, conducted a webinar highlighting the importance of voting and organized town halls with #NotAgainSU and DPSChief Bobby Maldonado. 'If we do these movements and we get these things in people's minds to start, to research and to look at themselves and how they can better themselves, it's going to improve their community,' said Monica Belk, a Black Oranges founder. 'It's going to improve the country.'

Cohen, who was arrested in his Ohio home in December, faces charges of rape in the first degree, burglary in the second degree, attempted sexual abuse in the first degree and forcible touching. The Syracuse Police Department, along with DPSand the Onondaga County District Attorney's Office, launched an investigation after DPS responded to an assault complaint from Cohenin August. DPS later found that Cohen was involved in a physical confrontation with another student that may have started when the student learned Cohen had allegedly sexually assaulted two classmates. Several posts also began circulating on social media at the time accusing Cohen and encouraging the university to take action.

Hawkins, a retired UPS employee who currently lives in Syracuse, was the Green Party's nominee for the 2020 presidential election after receiving 210 out of 355 votes on the first ballot in July. Hawkins, a co-founder of the Green Party, was one of the few candidates in his party with the experience to run a large-scale campaign. His presidential run came after 24 campaigns and 24 losses for public office. Apart from co-founding the Green Party in the early 1980s, Hawkins has also protested the Vietnam War and co-founded an organization that opposed nuclear power. Along with his former running mate Angela Walker, he advocated a federal plan to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat economic inequality. More than winning the presidency, the main goal of Hawkins' campaign was to encourage more Green Party candidates to run for local office and to put issues on the public agenda that Democratic and Republican candidates usually ignore. 'There are issues that need real solutions, and the Green Party offers them,' he said. 'It's important to build a party and a movement around those issues and those policies,' Hawkins said.

Jaleel Campbell graduated from SUNY Purchase into a world of uncertainty. Shortly after receiving his Masters of Fine Arts degree, he began setting up a creative space for himself[30] out of an Otisco Street apartment, where he displays his work. Campbell wants to make Jaleel Campbell Studios a dedicated space for Black artists to come together. 'In an ideal world where COVID isn't happening, I want to have this be the center of all Black art creativity going on here in Syracuse,' Campbell said. 'I want this to be the central hub where all of the Black creatives that are working here can meet each other and network and grow with one another.' Indigenous artist and graphic designer Ikerson Hopper has focused on art since his childhood[31]. He's picked up new mediums over the years, including graphic design, carvings and quillwork. Recently, he made shirts bringing awareness to the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women movement in the U.S.and Canada and donated a large portion of the proceeds to the Native Women's Shelter of Montreal. Lauren McComber, the owner of Lotus + Sage Holistics, loves how Hopper's artwork depicts Haudenosaunee culture and said she's never met an artist involved in social causes, building community and giving back quite like Hopper. Cuban immigrant Jos Miguel Hernndez Hurtado founded the La Joven Guardia del Teatro Latino in 1999 to enrich and educate disadvantaged youth through theater[32]. Since some children in Syracuse don't have a support system, he put together a group to help them increase their self-esteem. He serves as a mentor for his students inside and outside of the theater. '(La Joven Guardia del Teatro Latino) literally changed my whole life,' said Yanetsy Meriño Bacallao, one of his former students and the current president of La Joven Guardia.

The Waiting for Normalproject challenged photographers to turn the camera on themselves and their families while isolated from the rest of the world. In addition to photographs that illustrated their experiences, each photographer chose one all-encompassing word, supplemented by a journal entry, to describe their quarantine: how they felt, what they saw, how they changed. Fifteen photographers volunteered to take this challenge, and together, they created a quarantine memoir woven out of each of their distinct stories. They chronicled how they reunited with family, how they felt lost in between, how they adapted and grew.

75,/content/Bias_Crime_Lexis_1.DOCX,CQ Transcriptions,2020-07-09,,,,,LT. GOV. GEOFF DUNCAN (R-GA) IS INTERVIEWED ON CNN,False,"EVENT DATE: July 9, 2020
TYPE: NEWS PROGRAM
SPEAKER: LT. GOV. GEOFF DUNCAN (R-GA)
ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR: Joining us now to talk about this and more, we have Georgia's lieutenant governor, Geoff Duncan. Lieutenant Governor, great to see you. Thanks for being here. 
 Let me pull up the graph of what Georgia looks like just since you reopened parts of the state. So that was April, the end of April, April 30th. And you can see this steady incline up. This is the seven-day moving average of new confirmed cases and you're also up in deaths and hospitalizations. So what's gone wrong in Georgia? 
LT. GOV. GEOFF DUNCAN (R-GA): Well, we're certainly paying very close attention to the infection rate. We obviously, across the country, are seeing an increase in infections. I think other numbers that we're continuing to pay close attention to are hospitalizations and deaths. And fortunately for now, the data doesn't point to the exact correlation that we saw early on. 
 When you talk to our hospitals around the state, obviously a huge concern of ours is to make sure that there's available resources at those hospitals. We continue to hear good words from our hospital systems that there are additional resources out there. 
 But, you know, one of the things I think we need to continue to talk about is there are improved therapies that are continuing to arrive that yesterday on a conversation with some folks in the healthcare system, talked about the average stay on the front end of this virus was 14 days in hospitalization, and now it's down to five to seven days five. 
CAMEROTA: But hospitalizations are going up in your state. 
DUNCAN: Yes, certainly. And we're paying close attention to that. And, fortunately, for now, the correlation, the direct correlation between infection rates and hospitalizations don't seem to be as tightly matched, but we're going to continue to pay close attention to that. 
CAMEROTA: But I guess my point is that Georgia ended it stay-at-home order long before some places. So New York's ended sometime in June. Georgia's ended April 30th. Do you think that was too early now? 
DUNCAN: Well, certainly, we're trying to figure out the balance between business and the economy and obviously the healthcare concerns. But I would point to other states, you know, a state like California was probably the, you know, one of the first to close and one of the last to open. And certainly, they're dealing with an increased infection rate. 
 So I think it's definitely a balance. We're going to continue to pay close attention to the data. We're going to continue to push a message out there, like our governors continue to do about wearing face masks when at all possible, making sure we sterilize, making sure we take social distancing everywhere we go. 
CAMEROTA: I mean, on a scale of one to ten, how worried are you about what you're seeing in Georgia? 
DUNCAN: Well, certainly, I think everybody, 350 million Americans are worried. There's billions of people in this world that are worried about this. We continue to try to make the best decisions we possibly can. We continue to look at the data. We continue to consult with medical professionals, with scientists, with data experts. We're trying to make the best decisions we can to move forward here. 
CAMEROTA: So do you think that at this point, because hospitalizations are up, deaths are up, there should be a mask mandate in your state? 
DUNCAN: Well, the position that the governor takes, and I fully support this, is that we are encouraging every single person in our state, all 11 million Georgians in every community to wear a mask whenever possible. 
 Certainly, I've seen great results to that. The room I'm sitting in here today, everybody is wearing a mask. I was at the grocery store yesterday, I didn't see a single person without a mask. I think this whole notion of trying to mandate somewhat becomes a distraction and it's hard to enforce. 
 I think we need, as leaders, continue to encourage everyone in every community to take this very seriously with social distancing, with wearing masks, with being clean and having the highest levels of hygiene. 
CAMEROTA: I want to talk to you about Georgia's new hate crime law. We have followed every step along the way, as you have championed that law. It has come to pass, as you predicted on our air. There were some hiccups, obviously, and some major speed bumps with it. One was that Senate Republicans tried to include protection for the police in the hate crime law. And that was seen as, I think, something of a poisoned pill, so it ended up being turned into two separate bills. 
 And Ahmaud Arbery's mom basically felt that that was -- somehow, it actually tainted the results of the hate crime law, having this other law be passed in tandem to it. So let me play for you what she says. Oh, I'll read it to you. She says, though we stand in full support of all law enforcement, we believe that this separate bill, 838, is more dangerous to our community than the hate crime law, 426, is good. 
 To see the legislature prioritize 838 instead of repealing citizens' arrest is heartbreaking and does not do justice for my son. 
 What's your reaction to that? 
DUNCAN: Well, certainly, I've been with you all the way through this process over the last month, trying to get the hate crimes bill from a committee room up to the floor for a vote and into the governor's desk and we've gotten to see all of that play out. I'm certainly, very proud of the Georgia State Senate and the bipartisan cooperation, state Senator Harold Jones and State Senator Bill Cowsert came together to work with us to get this across the finish line. It will never leave my mind the importance of bipartisan teamwork to tackle tough issues. 
 Certainly, the Georgia State Senate and Georgia as a whole definitely support law enforcement. And having two separate bills, I don't believe, taints the effort. I believe making sure that we protect bias-motivated crimes, which is what we were able to accomplish in house bill 426. And then house bill 838 was an opportunity to make sure that if somebody uses a bias-motivated intimidation against a law enforcement officer that we're able to make sure that there's recourse there too. 
 So I'm certainly proud of the great work -- I'm certainly glad to sit here today and be able to tell you that Georgia is no longer on that list of states that does not have a hate crimes bill on the books. 
CAMEROTA: We know how important that was to you, and thank you for updating us all along the way. Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan, great to see you. 
DUNCAN: Thank you.
