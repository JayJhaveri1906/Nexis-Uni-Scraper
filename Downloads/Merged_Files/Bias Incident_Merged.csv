The New York chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-NY), the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, has called on the New York City Police Department (NYPD) to investigate an alleged anti-Muslim assault and property damage incident as a hate crime.
On July 2, 2020, at approximately 11:45 p.m , Mr. Rashid Hassan, a Pakistani taxi driver, was the victim of an assault and property damage. Mr. Hassan was driving 3 young men in Brooklyn. As they approached their final drop-off destination in Flatbush, Brooklyn, two of the men began to kick and damage Mr. Hassan’s vehicle while the third individual, who was sitting in the seat behind Mr. Hassan, grabbed Mr. Hassan’s hair and yanked. Mr. Hassan exited the vehicle to tell the men to stop damaging his vehicle, and the men began to yell and use vulgar language. At that point, a fourth individual, who had not been in the vehicle, approached Mr. Hassan and punched him in the face. During the altercation, the men yelled “Go back to your country” and directed other anti-Muslim profanities and language towards Mr. Hassan.
The police and an ambulance were called to the scene. Mr. Hassan was taken to the hospital and may need surgery on his eye to prevent blindness due to a blood clot resulting from the assault. Another driver nearby recorded the incident and provided the footage to the responding officer(s). The NYPD has not indicated if the incident is being investigated by its Hate Crime Task Force.

CAIR-NY Litigation Director Ahmed Mohamed said:
“Bias-motivated attacks such as this one experienced by Mr. Hassan must be investigated as such, especially because of the increased number of such incidents targeting American Muslims and other minority communities. New Yorkers of all faiths should be able to perform their job and go about their business without fear of being subjected to violent acts motivated by hate and bigotry.”
He noted that CAIR has reported a spike in bigotry targeting American Muslims, immigrants and members of other minority groups since the election of Donald Trump as president.

Her panels will transform a Brooklyn subway station.
On Tuesday, New Yorkers commuting through the Atlantic Avenue-Barclays Center subway station will find it transformed with vibrant portraits of Black, Asian and Pacific Islander people along with anti-discriminatory messages like ''I did not make you sick'' and ''I am not your scapegoat.'' 
 The series is the work of the neuroscientist turned artist Amanda Phingbodhipakkiya (pronounced PING-bodee-bak-ee-ah). In August, Ms. Phingbodhipakkiya was named a New York City Public Artist in Residence through a program that has partnered artists with city agencies since 2015. She is one of two artists currently embedded with the city's Commission on Human Rights, which invested $220,000 in this campaign.
 Ms. Phingbodhipakkiya's ''I Still Believe in Our City'' series was created as a response to a grim statistic. From February to September, the Commission received more than 566 reports of discrimination, harassment and bias related to Covid-19 -- 184 of which were anti-Asian in nature. It's a troubling spike not just appearing in New York, but in Asian-American communities across the country.
 ''My goal with this art series was to turn these hurts into something beautiful and powerful,'' Ms. Phingbodhipakkiya said in a phone interview. She added, ''I really wanted to find a way to say, despite everything we have faced as Asian-Americans and New Yorkers, that I still believe in New York.''
 From Nov. 3 to Dec. 2, the series of 45 pieces will be displayed in the Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn, a central hub that serves a diverse group of commuting New Yorkers. Ms. Phingbodhipakkiya said that it was also the site of a reported, Covid-related bias incident in March, when a 26-year-old Asian-American man reported he was spat on.
 A description of that incident has been included in one of the pieces, alongside portraits of Asians and flowers that Ms. Phingbodhipakkiya said have symbolic meanings in Chinese and East Asian cultures. Other panels offer information and historical context about the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and statistics about Asian-owned businesses.
 The series also features portraits of Black people as a sign of solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement and as a larger call to end institutional racism.
 ''As you traverse the terminal and look upon Asian and Black faces, full of defiance and strength, and learn about the injustices that we've faced,'' Ms. Phingbodhipakkiya said, ''you can't help but see us and you can't help but feel that we are reclaiming space.''
 For Ms. Phingbodhipakkiya, whose parents are Thai and Indonesian, the series is personal. Growing up in Georgia before moving to New York 14 years ago, she said she and her family experienced anti-Asian bias firsthand. Through this series, she wanted to amplify those experiences, and those of others in her community, which oftentimes go unnoticed.
 ''My art has always been about making the invisible visible,'' she said. ''I've explored everything from microscopic universes to outer space and things that just can't be seen with the naked eye. And I think struggles of communities of color are often invisible.''
 After a monthlong display in Atlantic Terminal, art from the series will appear around various points of the city in bus shelters, LinkNYC kiosks and Department of Transportation display cases. There are also plans for a hand-painted mural to appear in the city, with the exact location yet to be announced.

7,/content/Bias_Incident_Lexis_1.DOCX,Newstex Blogs,2020-11-27,487 words,,Percy Blakeney,,A Quarter of 2019 European Hate Crimes Target Jews,False,"Nov 27, 2020( Granite Grok: http://granitegrok.com/ Delivered by Newstex) On the European continent, there were a total of 5,954 bias incidents documented in 2019. Of that number 1,311 were anti-Semitic. Jews make up less than 1% of the population. 
Therefore anti-Semitic incidents accounted for 22% of hate crimes recorded last year in the region.The statistic is startling. Stop and think and you will realize the hatred of Jews is around 25 times higher than other groups in the population there. Can you explain this? Does it seem desirable or reasonable? The data on hate crimes comes from a report done by the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR). ODIHR in turn is part of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). ODIHR made the report in its annual report published last week. The report is based on data transmitted by governments and watchdog groups. Of the total incidents, 1,311 were anti-Semitic. The report has the title '2019 Hate Crime Data.' Anti-Semitism was the category with the second-largest number of incidents. There were 2,371 incidents in the more general Racism and Xenophobia category. Those targeted for their gender or sexual orientation (1,277 cases) made up the third-highest group, followed by Christians (573) and Muslims (507). In one anti-Semitic incident recorded in the report, a woman had her hair and hat pulled violently from behind while speaking Hebrew on the bus in Berlin, Germany. In another, an Iraqi Muslim man wearing a kippah and carrying several concealed knives was intercepted by guards attempting to enter an Antwerp synagogue in June. The man had used anti-Semitic insults at Jews before the incident. The report said its figures are not definitive. They may be lower than the number of hate crimes committed or recorded in Europe. America is trending in a very intolerant direction. In America too we are seeing a rising tide of bias incidents. This is an important barometer of America's cultural change. When we see rising numbers of incidents in our metropolitan areas it is telling us something. And we are seeing this. This week we had an anti-religious case decided at the Supreme Court. The State of New York was found to be discriminating against Catholics and Jews. New York's covid restrictions are being used in targeting these religious groups. This is an act of overt discrimination. Intolerance is a real thing. It is evil and pernicious. We must as a nation hold ourselves individually to a higher standard. Freedom requires tolerance. We need to find, to cultivate, tolerance in our pursuit of freedom. This should become part of our personal values, not a political talking point.

8,/content/Bias_Incident_Lexis_1.DOCX,CNN Wire,2020-10-17,960 words,,,,Report reveals 'long-simmering racial tensions' in New York State courts,False," (CNN) -- A report that was made public Thursday reveals ""long-simmering racial tensions"" among court officers and racist statements made openly by attorneys, judges, and other courthouse personnel in New York State courts.
The report was put together by a team headed by former Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson, who was appointed to conduct a review of racial bias in the state court system in June by New York State Chief Judge Janet DiFiore.
DiFiore said in June that her request for the report was spurred by the killing of George Floyd and came two days after a Brooklyn court officer allegedly posted a racist illustration depicting President Obama with a noose around his neck, which Johnson says ""peeled the lid off of long-simmering racial tensions.""
The biggest issue Johnson identified was an ""under-resourced, over-burdened"" court system and ""the dehumanizing effect it has on litigants,"" especially people of color, in housing, family, civil and criminal courts. Johnson said it has created what is in effect a ""second class system of justice"" for people of color in New York. 
People involved in cases often wait for hours or even come back another day for their case to finally be called, which causes many to miss work or spend much needed resources on additional childcare, the report states. Interviewees across the state also said there was an established practice of scheduling litigants who have paid for counsel on their own before clients who are represented by public defenders or legal aid attorneys. 
One public defender detailed an incident where she was in an elevator with her Black, teenage clients, when a White court officer sergeant said, ""Keep running your mouth. You'll always be a n***er."" 
In another incident detailed in the report, ""another court officer of color recounted an incident in a locker room where a white court officer referred to a Black court officer as 'one of the good monkeys.'""
""According to interviewees, these incidents were reported, but the court officers involved were not disciplined,"" the report states.
""These court officers also told us they felt they could not report incidents of bias for fear of being ostracized by their fellow officers and facing adverse career consequences from powerful and entrenched union leaders,"" Johnson said. ""We note that at least one union leader has himself posted offensive messages on social media, leading several court officers to brand union leadership as a ""safe haven for racist speech and actions.""
Dennis Quirk, head of the New York State Court Officers Association, shared with CNN a letter that the union's attorney, Pat Bonanno, sent to Johnson Friday in response to the report's claims, where Bonanno says the allegations in the report are ""misinformed, flagrantly incorrect and defamatory."" 
The letter states that union leadership met with Johnson in June for the report, and that ""racially insensitive conduct on the part of any member is not tolerated"" by the union and that it, too, supports equal justice under the law in the state's court system.
Johnson and his team spent four months interviewing nearly 300 people involved in the court system, including current and former judges, court clerks, court watchers, court officers, court attorneys, administrative personnel, civil and criminal attorneys, public defenders and prosecutors, the report says.
Many interviewees, Johnson said, told his team that they don't feel comfortable filing complaints about racial bias for fear of retaliation from superiors or colleagues.
One former prosecutor said ""black defendants are more often handcuffed when appearing for minor infractions, while their white counterparts are not,"" according to the report.
""Even some judges told us they hesitate to report court officers, citing incidents where court officers have created a hostile environment for judges who they feel have criticized them,"" the report states. ""One very senior judge confided that she is aware that some judges are afraid of reprimanding or correcting the misbehavior of certain court officers in their courtrooms.""
The report notes that all new judges receive bias training, but that judges ""expressed fear of raising issues of racial bias, out of concern for blowback from fellow judges. Court attorneys, as at-will employees, fear reporting incidents of bias against the judges they work for.""
Attorneys were also accused of making comments that were overly racist and condescending to litigants of color, the report says.
""One public defender reported an instance in which he witnessed a court-appointed attorney buy boots on her iPad while her client lost custody of her child in Family Court,"" according to the report.
There are so many instances of inappropriate comments made to attorneys of color that one legal organization's head told the report's writers that ""attorneys of color practicing in one county keep a running Google document tracking the inappropriate comments they hear from judicial personnel,"" the report states.
Johnson's report recommends developing mandatory bias training for judges and non-judicial employees, strengthening the process for reporting incidents of racial bias, and to emphasize that reports can be filed anonymously. Johnson also recommended the court system's leadership adopt a ""zero tolerance"" policy for racial bias. 
The report notes that while there is bias training for judges, training for non-judicial court employees doesn't appear to be ""consistent."" Court officers receive a form of implicit bias training at their academy, the report said, but the writers were told the training was ""lacking"" and ""did not actually prioritize understanding racial bias.""

The New York chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-NY), a chapter of the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, today condemned a hate-crime victimizing a Hispanic woman on New York’s Interstate 84. The incident occurred at 5:30 a.m in Brewster, near exit 65. The victim thankfully sustained no injuries.
While sleeping in her car on the westbound shoulder of I-84, the woman was approached by two white males in a Chevrolet pickup truck. The suspects began screaming racial slurs, prompting the victim to attempt an escape. Upon driving away, the men struck her car with their two-tone, black and silver Chevrolet truck.
SEE: https://patch.com/new-york/southeast/ny-state-cops-probe-hate-crime-reported-i-84
The first suspect was described as a Caucasian male, possibly in his mid-40’s, husky build, copper colored beard, blonde hair, thick brimmed dark color glasses, a green button-up shirt and baggy blue jeans.
The second suspect was described as a Caucasian male, possibly in his mid-20’s, skinny build, wearing a green tank top, and with a tattoo of the letters “Ang” located on his left wrist.
In a statement, CAIR-NY Executive Director Afaf Nasher called on Brewster residents to call with suspect-identifying information:
“CAIR-NY condemns the dangerous, aggressive and racially-motivated attack on this innocent woman resting in her car. While we are deeply thankful the victim sustained no injuries, the suspects must be identified and held accountable. To this end, CAIR-NY is calling on Brewster residents who may have any information about the identity of the two men to contact local law enforcement. We hope the aggressors are caught and brought to justice swiftly before any more harm is perpetrated.”

Graffiti included a swastika, the drawing of a penis, the words 'Jews' and 'n-----'
The mayor has condemned the vandalism as 'disturbing' and 'a hate crime'
Antisemitic and racist graffiti scrawled on the street in a town in northern New Jersey over Halloween as been condemned as 'disturbing' and 'a hate crime'. 
The graffiti was found in Woodcliff Lake, in the Woodmont neighbourhood, on the morning of October 31. 
The mayor of Woodcliff Lake shared the photographs of the graffiti scrawled in white chalk on Woodmont Drive which included a swastika, the drawing of a penis, and the words 'Jews' and 'n-----'.
Woodcliff Lake Mayor Carols A. Rendo said: 'These images are disturbing and criminal. It is vandalism and a hate crime. 
'The perpetrators will be dealt with to the fullest extent of the law. Any resident with information on this please contact our police department. 
The crime happened on Mischief Night, an informal holiday on the night before Halloween, when children and teenagers are emboldened to engage in pranks and vandalism. 
The extent of their pranks usually range from dangling toilet paper and silly string from trees, and throwing soap or eggs on parked cars. 
The Mayor Carols A. Rendo told the New York Post: 'A resident text me early in the morning and I was quite disturbed and upset by it.' 
He said he expects that the perpetrators are 'ignorant kids who thought it was funny.'
According to the Post, there are a significant number of Jewish Americans living in Woodcliff Lake.
Mercy Gaete commented on the mayor's post on Facebook, writing: 'Absolutely disgraceful. It does not matter how old these ""kids"" are. This is learned behavior. 
'This is a hate crime and they should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.' 
A police investigation into the 'hate speech' incident is underway. 
The Woodcliff Lake police department tweeted: 'The WCLPD is investigating a bias incident regarding hate speech and symbols displayed in the area of Woodmont Drive. 
'Residents with info are encouraged to contact police HQ at 201-391-8222. We are taking this matter very seriously as this conduct is unacceptable in our community.' 
Bias crimes in New Jersey are on the rise. Last year, the state of New Jersey logged 994 bias incidents, almost a 75% increase from the year before.
It is the most largest year-to-year increase since New Jersey began tracking incidents and the state's highest total. ",Bias Incident

One white court officer in Brooklyn posted an illustration of President Barack Obama with a noose around his neck on social media. Another white officer referred to a Black court officer as “one of the good monkeys.”
A third white court officer commented to a white colleague that he would have done better on a firearms test if he had been given a “Sean Bell target,” a reference to an unarmed Black man killed by the police in 2006.
The incidents of overt racism were among several mentioned in a new report about racial bias in the New York State Court system commissioned by Chief Judge Janet DiFiore after national protests this summer against institutional racism in the criminal justice system.
Jeh C. Johnson, a former Homeland Security secretary under President Obama, led the team that did the review. His report, released with little fanfare last week, found pervasive racism in New York courts, both explicit and implicit, from judges, court officers and lawyers. The accounts of racial bias the team collected bore a striking similarity to testimony in another review from three decades ago, the report said.
The state’s court system, one of the busiest in the country, is overburdened and understaffed, the report said. In New York City, the system has had a “dehumanizing effect” and disparate effect on people of color moving through the housing, family, civil and criminal courts, it said.
“The sad picture that emerges is, in effect, a second-class system of justice for people of color in New York State,” wrote Mr. Johnson, a partner at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison. “This is a moment that demands a strong and pronounced rededication to equal justice under law by the New York State Court system.”
The chief administrative judge, Lawrence K. Marks, said the court system would try to implement all of the report’s recommendations.
“The findings are troubling, but not surprising,” Judge Marks said. “Nothing could be more important at this moment in time than for the court system to take all necessary steps to combat bias and ensure racial equality.”
Racism among court officers highlighted
Mr. Johnson wrote that a Brooklyn court officer’s “vile, racist posting” in June about former President Barack Obama had “peeled the lid off long-simmering racial tensions and intolerance within the court officer community.”
The officer, Sgt. Terri Napolitano of Brooklyn Criminal Court, was accused of uploading to Facebook an illustration of Mr. Obama with a noose around his neck and of Hillary Clinton being taken to a wooden apparatus to be hanged. Sergeant Napolitano did not respond to a request for comment.
She was suspended for 30 days, her firearm was taken away and she was on paid leave with disciplinary charges pending, court officials said. After the posts appeared, three Black court officers sent a letter to Judge DiFiore saying the racist memes were “only the tip of the iceberg.”
The sergeant’s behavior had long been tolerated, the report said, which was evidence of a broader institutional acceptance of racist conduct. It recommended “more robust bias training for nonjudicial personnel, particularly the court officer community.”
Judge Marks said the administration will mandate, expand and improve bias training for court officers and work to ensure broader diversity in supervisory court officer positions.
Mr. Johnson’s team found that some court officers, in dealing with people of color who were defendants, lawyers or the public, were disrespectful, condescending, and at times, racist.
Court officers were heard using racial slurs and berating minority litigants about the clothes they wore. Black defendants were often handcuffed when appearing in court for minor infractions, while white defendants were not, the report found.
Some court officers told the report’s authors they did not report instances of bias out of fear of retaliation from powerful union leaders. They worried that doing so could jeopardize their career, according to the report.
The report also noted that one union leader had posted offensive messages on social media, calling protesters who sprayed graffiti on a court van “animals” and posting a profile picture with the Betsy Ross flag, which has been linked to white supremacist groups like the Ku Klux Klan.
Dennis Quirk, the longtime president of the New York State Court Officers Association, acknowledged in an interview that he was the leader mentioned in the report. He said his use of the term “animals” was unrelated to race.
“It don’t matter if you’re Hispanic, gay, female or whatever — you did something you shouldn’t be doing,” he said.
Mr. Quirk said he does not support white supremacy and did not know that the Betsy Ross flagwas associated with racist groups. He called the report an attempt by the chief judge to discredit the union and diminish its power.
But Mr. Quirk acknowledged that racism was a problem among his union’s members. “We have white officers who come and tell us that Black and Hispanic officers are saying things that are not proper,” he said, adding that Black officers have complained about white officers making inappropriate remarks. “Racism exists in every walk of life no matter where you go.”
Pat Bonanno, a lawyer representing the union that Mr. Quirk leads, said in a letter sent to Mr. Johnson that the union “condemns in the harshest possible way any instance of insensitivity, racially animated or otherwise, on the part of any member of the association.” Mr. Bonanno denied the allegations raised against the union and its leaders, calling them “inaccurate and defamatory.”
Lawyers confront racism on two fronts
As part of the review, Mr. Johnson and his team interviewed nearly 300 people throughout the court system, including many Black and Hispanic lawyers who recounted incidents of bias.
These lawyers said that they were often mistaken for criminal defendants and were asked to show identification to enter the courthouse while most white lawyers were not questioned. They also said they were often asked to identify themselves when they sat in the front row of the courtroom, which is reserved for lawyers.
Black and Hispanic lawyers told the report’s authors that they are “believed less often” when making statements to judges, a problem that is magnified when their client is also a person of color.
One lawyer said she has been called “aggressive” while her white male counterparts have not when they have made similar arguments before the court, the report said.
Chrishana White, a Black woman who is the director of diversity and inclusion for Brooklyn Defender Services, a public defender organization, said the kind of pervasive racism in courthouses that the report highlighted had led her to stop practicing law. She said when she walked into court she was often “assumed to be less than an attorney.”
“It’s dehumanizing,” Ms. White said in a phone interview. “It somewhat feels like the 1960s — the way you’re treated and judged and misjudged.”
She added, “Day in and day out my colleagues are fighting every day against these systems, fighting for the best for our clients, but also fighting against court officers and judges.”
Judiciary still lags in diversity
The report zeroed in on another problem: a lack of diversity among judges. Even in New York, a city where more than half of the residents are Black or Hispanic, only a quarter of criminal court judges are people of color.
Judges interviewed for the report said there were challenges to diversifying the judiciary. The appointment process, some judges said, required candidates to go through judicial screening committees that were predominately white.
One judge said the electoral process also tends to marginalize Black and Hispanic candidates. Like the appointive process, it depends on a candidate’s personal connections, and the nominating system, which is controlled by party loyalists, “causes candidates of color to be bypassed or discouraged by party leadership, particularly in upstate counties.”
Judges also said a persistent lack of resources devoted to some of the busiest courts, like the housing and family courts in New York City, has had a disparate effect on Black and Hispanic residents, who make up most of the people with cases before those judges.
One judge said the reluctance of state court officials to devote more resources to high-volume courts in New York City, which largely serve poor people of color, is “the very definition of institutional bias,” according to the report.
Next steps
Noting many participants in the system are afraid of retribution if they criticize judges or court officers, the report recommended that the Office of Court Administration do more to encourage court employees to report incidents of bias to the system’s inspector general. That office currently investigates fewer than 10 complaints of racial bias each year.
The report also called for the expansion of bias training for judges and all other personnel, and for the strengthening of existing organizations focused on addressing racism, including the Office of Diversity and Inclusion.
That office’s team, which works on improving diversity in the court system, was cut from eight people to two. Funding for programs addressing racial bias was denied in 2018, and “far too little” has been spent since then to develop such a program, the report said.
Judge Marks said the administration has already started to develop a mandatory bias training program.
“There’s zero tolerance in the court system for racial bias,” he said.

One white court officer in Brooklyn posted an illustration of President Barack Obama with a noose around his neck on social media. Another white officer referred to a Black court officer as ''one of the good monkeys.'' 
 A third white court officer commented to a white colleague that he would have done better on a firearms test if he had been given a ''Sean Bell target,'' a reference to an unarmed Black man killed by the police in 2006.

The NYPD Calls It A ""Dispute Amongst Neighbors""",False,"Nov 11, 2020( Gothamist: http://www.gothamist.com/ Delivered by Newstex) A Muslim father-of-two in Queens was hospitalized after being beaten by a neighbor who has been harassing his family for weeks, according to a lawyer with a Muslim civil rights group who is now demanding the NYPD investigate the attack as a hate crime.Rego Park residents Khaled Aly and his wife Neamat Taha as well as their two young children were going into their apartment complex about 11 p.m. on Friday when another man and woman allegedly approached Taha. The woman grabbed Taha by her hijab while the man approached her, according to Council on American-Islamic Relations's New York chapter (CAIR-NY).Aly demanded the suspects leave his wife alone, and they began attacking and beating him, telling the family, ""we are in America,"" calling Aly a ""fucking Muslim,"" and threatened to kill their family, according to the civil rights group.Aly, a 38-year-old Egyptian-American, was hospitalized and required surgery, CAIR-NY said. 
He was discharged on Monday evening.""We hope that law enforcement is taking this very seriously and investigates in a fair manner, and due to the anti-Muslim statements that were made at the time of the assault, that the Hate Crimes Task Force would be called into investigate and to decide through their investigation whether this is a biased motivated attack,"" said Ahmed Mohamed, the legal director for CAIR's New York chapter.The attack happened in front of the children, ages 6 and 8.""He and his family are going to be living through this nightmare for a very long time,"" Mohamed said.CAIR-NY said the two alleged attackers are two of the family's neighbors, who live in the same apartment complex, but NYPD has not yet arrested anyone in the case.""We're talking four days later and arrests haven't been made to an extremely violent crime,"" Mohamed said in an interview Tuesday afternoon. ""We know which apartment they're in. The law enforcement officials have been told.""On Saturday at 4:30 a.m., Taha was returning to the apartment complex from the hospital after her husband was attacked. She was again confronted by the male attacker who bragged about the attack, telling her, ""I'm going to burn you and burn your family,"" CAIR-NY alleges.The family has not returned to their home out of fear for their safety, according to Mohamed.The two alleged attackers have been harassing the family since late September.Mohamed says at least two other incidents were reported to police, but Friday was when the confrontations became physically violent.NYPD spokesperson Sergeant Edward Riley confirmed that Aly was hospitalized after being struck with some type of object, and then kicked in the face and torso.But the NYPD is not investigating the attack as a hate crime.Police believe the incident stems from an ""ongoing dispute amongst neighbors.""""The Hate Crime Task Force determined this not to be a bias incident,"" Riley said. ""The investigation is ongoing with the 112 Precinct Detective Squad.""The NYPD did not say whether police had questioned suspects the family has identified, nor why the Hate Crimes Task Force determined it was not a hate crime.

Results show that, in this jurisdiction, the typology is an inadequate tool for classifying cases prosecuted as hate crimes. Approximately one third of the cases are unclassifiable according to the typology. Findings indicate that the typology is useful for understanding cases in which bias is the sole motivation but inadequate for application to the many cases in which bias is a peripheral motivation.

Approximately one third of the cases are unclassifiable according to the typology. Findings indicate that the typology is useful for understanding cases in which bias is the sole motivation but inadequate for application to the many cases in which bias is a peripheral motivation. bias crimes hate crimes crime typology prosecution of hate crimes O ver the past few decades, there has been increased public debate con- cerning bias-motivated crimes as well as the development of legislation in virtually every state to combat such crimes (Jenness & Grattet, 2001). in virtually every state to combat such crimes (Jenness & Grattet, 2001). Currently, despite the president's veto threat, a bill is pending in Congress that will add gender, sexual orientation, and gender identity to the federal hate crime legislation (Stout, 2007). Despite the proliferation of legislation designed to combat hate crimes, few empirical studies have addressed the prosecution of hate crimes. In an effort to fill the void, this article contributes to the literature in two ways. First, it examines court data for all cases referred by investigators for prosecution as bias crimes in one New Jersey county between 2001 and 2004. Author's Note: Correspondence concerning this article should be addressed to Nickie D. Phillips, Department of Sociology and Criminal Justice, St. Francis College, 180 Remsen Street, Brooklyn, NY 11201; e-mail: nphillips@stfranciscollege.edu 884 These cases represent 5% of the 643 cases referred to investigators as poten- tial bias crimes. Second, it appears that this is the first empirical study apply- ing Levin and McDevitt's (1993, 2002) hate crime typology to cases occurring outside of Boston. Preliminary findings indicate that the typology is incom- plete because it fails to account for a large number of cases that were prose- cuted as bias crimes in this jurisdiction. In general, bias crimes are defined as crimes “that manifest evidence of prejudice based on race, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity” (Federal Bureau of Investigation [FBI], 2006). According to the most recent Uniform Crime Report's hate crime statistics, 8,380 hate crime offenses had occurred nationwide in 2005. However, scholars agree that bias-motivated crimes are underreported (Berk, Boyd, & Hamner, 1992; Garcia, McDevitt, Gu, & Balboni, 2003; Herek & Berrill, 1992; McDevitt et al., 2000). For example, Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) has estimated as many as 50,000 bias- motivated crimes per year, whereas the findings of National Crime Victimization Survey indicated that only about 44% of the 210,000 hate crime victimizations from July 2000 through December 2003 were reported to police (Harlow, 2005, p. 1: Southern Poverty Law Center, n.d.). Although bias crimes are believed to be underreported, they are a small percentage of the total crimes that occur. Specifically, Harlow (2005) had estimated that bias crimes comprised only “3% of all violent crimes revealed to the NCVS [National Crime Victimization Survey] by victims” (p. 1). Although bias crimes occur relatively infrequently, proponents of bias crime legislation argue that such crimes are qualitatively different from nonbias crimes and are therefore deserving of more severe punishment (Herek & Berrill, 1992; Lawrence, 1999; Levin, 1999). Enforcement of Bias Crime Legislation Prior research found much variability in the way law enforcement per- sonnel have interpreted and enforced laws prohibiting bias crimes. For example, Jenness and Grattet (2005) examined the various factors influenc- ing the extent to which hate crime policies developed at the local level across the state of California. The researchers found that organizational pervi- ousness, as measured by the presence of community group meetings, commu- nity policing practices, and workplace heterogeneity, was the strongest predictor of having a policy (Jenness & Grattet, 2005). Although having a department policy indicated some effort to formally address bias crimes, it did not necessarily translate into actual enforcement. 885 Haider-Markel (2002) surveyed police departments and district attor- neys across the nation about their perception of the enforcement of anti- gay/lesbian–bias crime legislation. According to the survey results, factors such as hate crime training for law enforcement, favorable attitudes toward enforcement of officers and supervisors, belief that enforcement has an impact on the level of hate crime, and the presence of state hate crime leg- islation were found to impact the enforcement of hate crime legislation. The above suggests that the development of hate crime policies and subse- quent implementation varies across jurisdictions. The enforcement of bias crime legislation is contingent on decision making by various actors at numer- ous stages, all influenced by the social context from which they operate. For example, to enforce bias crime legislation, incidents must be reported to law enforcement officers and classified as bias-motivated crimes. Research has indicated that classification and investigation procedures vary by department (Boyd, Berk, & Hamner, 1996; Martin, 1995). Furthermore, researchers examining the enforcement of bias crimes have noted that both investigators and prosecutors tend to look for the “perfect” case when enforcing bias crime legislation (Bell, 2002; Boyd et al., 1996; Levin & McDevitt, 2002). For example, Boyd et al. reported that investigators in one division developed a conception of a “true” or “normal” bias crime (p. 835). The investigators described true bias crimes as sharing the following characteristics: a lack of provocation by the victim, a lack of prior relationship between the offender and victim, and “a specific target, and accompanying derogatory insults” (Boyd et al., 1996, p. 835). The other division defined bias crime more broadly, classifying cases as bias motivated if there was even a “single ele- ment” indicating bias motivation (Boyd et al., 1996, p. 843). Similarly, other researchers have suggested that prosecutors are likely to only charge bias crimes in “perfect” cases or those in which “the evidence of bias is overwhelming” (Bell, 2002; Maroney, 1998, p. 604; see also Levin & McDevitt, p. 183). Maroney suggested that investigators and prosecutors will be quick to weed out “mixed-motive” cases, defined as those in which there is the presence of some motive other than bias. Maroney further suggested that both will reject such cases “even though many hate crime laws and departmen- tal protocols explicitly provide for inclusion of such crimes” (p. 604). Despite the effort by investigators to screen out problematic cases, Martin (1996), in her examination of hate crime incidents in Baltimore County, found that ambiguous cases remained for which investigators had to make a determination and “judgment about First Amendment issues that have vexed constitutional scholars” (p. 317). Thus, crimes in which bias is expressed, but not the primary motivation, present problems for investiga- tors and prosecutors in the enforcement of hate crime legislation. 886 Hate Crime Typology Typologies are developed and used to conceptualize and classify informa- tion in meaningful ways. Specifically, typologies have been developed for var- ious crimes such as rape, terrorism, domestic violence, and homicide (Groth & Birnbaum, 1979; Holmes & Holmes, 1998; Holtzworth-Munroe, Meehan, Herron, Rehman, & Stuart, 2000; Hudson, 1999; McCabe & Wauchope, 2005). One of the earliest efforts to focus on bias crimes included the seminal book by Levin and McDevitt (1993), Hate Crimes: The Rising Tide of Bigotry and Bloodshed. Levin and McDevitt examined the cultural influences on those that harbor bigotry and illustrated how bigotry manifests itself in violence. The book contributed to our understanding of hate crimes, by exploring the motiva- tions and patterns of violence, seemingly propelled by bigotry and prejudice and directed toward those viewed as different or the Other. Specifically, the authors developed a typology based on offender motivation. The typology, designed as an aid toward understanding the motivation of hate crime offenders, has been widely cited by scholars and has appeared in law enforcement training materials (American Prosecutors Research Institute [APRI], 2000; Gerstenfeld, 2004; McDevitt, Levin, & Bennet, 2002; McLaughlin, Malloy, Brilliant, & Lang, 2000; Perry, 2003; Shively, 2005; Wessler, 2000). For example, according to the training curriculum featured in McLaughlin et al.'s “Responding to Hate Crime: A Multidisciplinary Curricu- lum,” the typology has been used to do the following: assist law enforcement in identifying suspects, locate offenders, gain insight into the victim's percep- tion of his or her vulnerability, gain insight into the offender's motivation, determine the probability of escalation, and anticipate community response (p. 48). The curriculum suggest that whereas offenders may fit into more than one category, the typology assists in recognizing typical hate crimes. The typology is also referenced in the American Prosecutors Research Institute's A Local Prosecutor's Guide for Responding to Hate Crime as aiding officers to identify potential offenders. Levin and McDevitt's (1993) original typology consisted of three cate- gories: thrill, reactive (or defensive), and mission crimes. It was later updated to include a fourth category, retaliatory crimes (McDevitt et al., 2002). Thrill crimes were described as criminal behavior “set off by a desire for excitement and power” in McDevitt et al. (p. 306) and to have “some fun” and “to stir up a little excitement . . . at someone else's expense” in Levin and McDevitt (p. 65). Reactive crimes, later renamed defensive, were characterized by those in which the offender feels threatened by outsiders encroaching on their “com- munity, means of livelihood, or way of life” (Levin & McDevitt, p. 76). Such 887 crimes were considered a response to a threat to the offender's resources, such as minorities moving into a homogenous neighborhood. Mission crimes were described as those in which the offender believed the victim was “evil” and needed to be destroyed (Levin & McDevitt, p. 89). This often, but not neces- sarily, involved allegiance to a particular bias-related group or ideology. Retaliatory crimes were said to be sparked by “a desire to avenge a perceived degradation or assault on their group” (McDevitt et al., 2002, p. 306). Retaliatory crimes referred “specifically to incidents in which offenders act in response to a [real or perceived] hate crime” (McDevitt et al., 2002, p. 309). In their updated work, Hate Crimes Revisited: America's War on Those Who Are Different, Levin and McDevitt (2002) devoted a chapter to each cat- egory of the typology, offering numerous examples of crimes that have occurred across the nation. Many of the cases received significant media atten- tion such as Tom and John Metzger's involvement in the murder of Mulugeta Seraw (mission category) as well as the murder of Yusuf Hawkins in Bensonhurst, New York by a group of White young men (defensive category). In 2002, McDevitt et al. (2002) applied the typology to 169 cases reported and investigated as bias motivated by the Boston Police Department. Of the 169 cases, 111 were categorized by the researchers as thrill, 43 as defensive, 14 as retaliatory, and 1 as mission. The typology has been widely cited and used in training curriculum. Beyond the original authors, however, there are no empirical studies in which the typology has been systematically applied to a universe of cases forwarded to prosecutors in a particular jurisdiction. As Gerstenfeld (2004) stated, “its utility and meaning remain to be found” (p. 77; Shively, 2005). As such, the applicability of the typology must continue to be tested by researchers who are able to gain access to prosecutorial information about hate crimes in local jurisdictions. Despite its widespread use, the hate crime typology has some clear limi- tations. The categories are not mutually exclusive and various categories overlap. For example, in three of the four categories, the offender is likely to seek a location where victims congregate or are located. Similarly, in three of the four categories, peer influence is an important characteristic. Only in the retaliatory category is there a tendency that the offender will act alone. Furthermore, the typology omits cases in which bias is a peripheral com- ponent to the crime. For example, Martin (1995) found that although in some cases bias is expressed during the crime, it is not the primary cause of crime. Scholars have pointed out that the conception and definition of hate crime, specifically the determination of motive, is fraught with difficulty (Berk et al., 1992; Green, McFalls, & Smith, 2001; Jacobs, 1992-1993). Jacobs and Potter 888 Table 1 Levin & McDevitt's Hate Crime Typology Source: Levin and McDevitt (1993), and McDevitt, Levin, and Bennett (2002). a. Category added by McDevitt et al. (2002). The authors argued that retaliatory hate crimes tend to have greatest potential for fueling and refueling additional hate offenses. 889 (1998), who warned of the difficulty in investigating and classifying bias crimes, presented the dilemma in one concise statement: “Must the criminal conduct have been totally, primarily, substantially, or just slightly caused by prejudiced motivation?” (p. 21). Furthermore, Jacobs stated that, in effect, “Practically any crime committed by a member of one group against a member of another qualifies for investigation as a hate crime” (Jacobs, 1992- 1993, p. 548). Excluding cases in which bias is a peripheral component reduces the possibility of having an unwieldy typology. However, there is a lack of research documenting what types of cases are actually prosecuted as bias crimes. If many cases that involve bias as a peripheral motivation are in fact prosecuted as bias crimes, the typology may be of limited usefulness in this context. Method Data on hate crime incidents and offenses are collected from local law enforcement agencies and disseminated annually by the FBI. The FBI data are limited to aggregate measures of incidents and arrests, and contain no information on case processing. Unfortunately, there is no annual national database of hate crime prosecutions and convictions. Furthermore, the def- inition of hate crime varies among jurisdictions, and few states provide databases in which hate crime case processing and outcome information are provided. Instead, researchers must approach individual jurisdictions for access to case-processing data in disaggregate form. This study is the first systematic application of the typology to all cases prosecuted as bias crimes in a particular county over a 4-year period. These cases were determined by investigators to meet the criteria of a bias crime and, as a result, were referred to prosecutors. These cases represent 5% of the total cases examined by investigators during the study period. The pur- pose of the study is to provide an empirical test of the usefulness of the typology as it pertains to cases prosecuted as bias crimes. A jurisdiction in New Jersey was chosen because it has been identified as a leader in addressing bias crimes. It was among the first to develop a bias crime unit on the East Coast. The county has a population of more than 250,000, which is relatively affluent, with a median household income greater than the national median. In terms of race/ethnicity, the majority of the popula- tion is categorized as White. Blacks comprise the largest minority popula- tion, with Hispanic or Latino persons comprising less than 10% of the population (U.S. Census Bureau, 2000). The crime rate in the county is 890 slightly lower than the crime rate for the state of New Jersey (New Jersey State Police, 2005). This research involved the analysis of the files pertaining to all cases referred for prosecution as bias crimes between 2001 and 2004. These 30 cases were considered by investigators as the only cases suitable for bias crime prosecution out of a total of 643 cases originally investigated.2 As such, the cases in the current study have met the legal rigors of inclusion according to the New Jersey statute. They were judged by police and pros- ecutors who specialize in bias crimes as exhibiting legal characteristics of a bias crime. Therefore, the cases were by definition the least ambiguous from a legal standpoint and as such should be classifiable according to the hate crime typology. According to investigators, each case referred met the cri- teria as indicated in the New Jersey's Bias Incident Investigative Standards (BIIS; 2000). According to BIIS, a bias incident is defined as any suspected or confirmed offense or unlawful act which occurs to a person, private property, or public property on the basis of race, color, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity. An offense is bias based if the motive for the commission of the offense or unlawful act pertains to race, color, religion, gender, handicap, sexual orientation, or ethnicity (BIIS 2000, p. 9). By way of background, the bias unit in this county consists of two full- time investigators along with two officers that fill in when the designated investigators are unavailable. The unit is responsible for investigating all bias-motivated incidents (criminal and noncriminal), outreach to the com- munity and local schools in the form of workshops or presentations, and bias training for police officers. Potential bias-motivated crimes reach the bias unit through a variety of sources. The Office of Bias Crimes and Community Relations operates a statewide bias hotline in which victims may report bias-related incidents that are then forwarded to the appropriate jurisdiction. Furthermore, following a memorandum of agreement between the Department of Law and Public Safety and the Department of Education (New Jersey Administrative Code [N.J.A.C.], 6:29-10.1), schools in New Jersey are mandated to report all allegations of bias-motivated incidents to law enforcement. Finally, all police agencies in the county are required to forward all reported bias-motivated crimes to the bias unit at the county prosecutor's office. Once identified and confirmed as bias motivated by investigators, a case may be referred for prosecution as a bias crime. The New Jersey Bias Intimidation statute defines a bias crime as an offense committed “with a pur- pose to intimidate an individual or group of individuals because of race, color, religion, gender, handicap, sexual orientation, or ethnicity or knowing that the 891 conduct constituting the offense would cause an individual or group of indi- viduals to be intimidated because of race, color, religion, gender, handicap, sexual orientation, or ethnicity” (New Jersey Statute [NJS], 2C:16-1). The BIIS (2000, p. 15) also contains guidelines for confirming incidents of bias. Investigators are instructed to consider, for example, the totality of the circumstances, note any statements made by the suspect or witnesses, and look for bias symbols, words, graffiti, or other types of evidence. To classify cases, the investigators look for other motives for the incident, that is, whether the offenders are members of a hate group, whether the victim and offender share identities (e.g., racial, religious, or ethnic group identi- ties), and whether the victim recently moved into the area. Information on cases was retrieved from both investigative and prosecutor case files. Investigative case files typically contained a cover sheet that included preliminary information regarding case characteristics, offender(s) and victim(s) characteristics, initial police report, and any subsequent investiga- tive materials such as transcripts of interviews with offender(s), victim(s), and witnesses. The prosecutor's case files typically contained information on the proposed indictment, grand jury decisions, a plea sheet, criminal history reports, sentence received, and copies of the investigative materials. Information coded from case files included the following: type of bias motivation (race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and gender), type of offense, location, number of offenders/ victims, victim injury, age and race of offender/victim, charges, and case disposition. This research entailed analyzing case file information and investigators' narratives, and coding those details according to McDevitt et al.'s (2002) bias crime typology (see also Levin & McDevitt, 1993).3 As previously mentioned, the characteristics of each category are noted in Table 1. In classifying cases into the typology, I followed as closely as possible the characteristics and examples provided in Levin and McDevitt, and McDevitt et al. Case narratives and interview transcripts of offenders, victims, and witnesses were examined to gain information pertaining to the triggering event, goal, peer influence, tar- geted victims, and typical location (see Table 1). The triggering event refers to any event that either precipitated, or acted as a catalyst to the behavior on the part of the offender. The goal refers to the underlying rationale for the behav- ior on the part of the offender (e.g., to rid the world of evil or to protect their neighborhood from outsiders). Peer influence, targeted victims, and location were noted for each case. However, the typology contains overlapping cate- gories, making difficult the task of straightforward classification of cases into distinct categories. For example, both reactive/defensive and retaliatory hate 892 crimes may involve a precipitating or triggering event. Similarly, peer influ- ence is characteristic of thrill, mission, and reactive/defensive categories. Cases in which there was no clear indication of the goal on the part of the offender were coded as unclassifiable. Results Of the total 643 cases presented to the bias unit between 2001 and 2004, 30 (less than 5%) were referred by the bias unit for prosecution as bias crimes. Although the data from the current study were limited to one juris- diction, this study includes the entire population of cases referred for prosecution as bias crimes between 2001 and 2004 (N = 30). Descriptive information for these cases is displayed in Table 2.4 Racial and religiously motivated crimes comprised 63% of the total cases. The number of offend- ers per case ranged from 1 to 4, with an average of 1.87 offenders. Nearly half of the cases involved a single offender, slightly under one fourth of the cases involved two offenders, and only two cases involved four offenders (see Table 2).55 Previous research has indicated that bias crimes are typically relatively low-level offenses (Garofalo & Martin, 1993). The cases presented for prose- cution in the current study were no exception. The prosecutor's office was unable to retrieve five files, therefore, case outcome information was restricted to cases in which files were available. Of these 25 cases, 23 involved at least one offender charged with a bias crime and the remaining 2 resulted in crimi- nal charges but not bias charges. Although the average number of offenders per case charged with a criminal offense was 2.0, the average number of offenders charged with a bias offense was 1.87. The average number of offenders convicted per case for a bias offense was 0.96 (see Table 3). Due to the small numbers of cases referred for prosecution as bias crimes during the 4-year period, it was not possible to conduct sophisti- cated statistical analyses to determine the impact of independent variables on conviction rates. However, identifiable patterns did emerge from the analysis. Of the cases resulting in a bias charge, religiously motivated and multibias cases were more likely to result in conviction than racially moti- vated cases (see Table 4). Nearly half of the cases that resulted in bias crime charges were catego- rized as juvenile cases (11 out of 23 cases). Juveniles were more likely than adults to be involved in property crimes than personal crimes. Furthermore, cases involving juveniles were more likely to result in conviction for a bias 893 Table 2 Case Characteristics a. Multibias cases refer to cases involving any combination of racial, religious, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or gender bias occurring within one incident. b. Cases were classified as juvenile or adult based on whether the offender was juvenile or adult (18 years or older) at the time of the crime. In cases with more than one offender, cases were coded according to the age of the majority of offenders. In cases in which there was a combination of juvenile and adult offenders, the age gap was generally not greater than 1 year. 894 Table 3 Charges and Convictions per Case Table 4 Bias Crime Typology a. The prosecutor's office was unable to locate files for five cases, therefore, case outcome information was not available for those cases. crime than adult cases. Correspondingly, cases involving property crimes were more likely to result in at least one offender conviction for a bias crime. One possible reason why cases involving juveniles were more likely to result in a bias conviction may relate to the extent to which the grand jury was reluctant to return an indictment on a bias charge for adult offenders. 895 It is also possible that juveniles committed crimes in which bias was likely to be perceived as the sole motivation for the crime and therefore more likely to result in conviction. Case Typology The hate crime typology was applied to the 30 cases referred for prose- cution by the bias unit. Two independent raters coded the cases, with 73% agreement. According to Rubin and Babbie (2004), a 70% agreement rate is considered acceptable. Of the 30 cases referred for prosecution by the bias unit, 13 were coded as motivated by thrill, 4 as mission, 1 as defensive, and 1 as retaliation (see Table 4). The remaining cases were simply unclassifiable. Many cases did not fit any of the four predesignated categories of the typology. Many cases eluded the thrill category because there was no apparent evidence that the offender set out to get kicks or to “stir up a little excitement” (Levin & McDevitt, 2002, p. 67). Rather, the bias appeared to emerge due to an interpersonal confrontation with the victim. Furthermore, although the behaviors often appeared retaliatory in scope because they occurred in the context of ongoing interpersonal con- frontations, they were distinguishable from McDevitt et al.'s (2002) concept of “retaliation,” which refers “specifically to incidents in which offenders act in response to a hate crime” (p. 309). In other words, bias was a peripheral com- ponent, emerging during the context of an already existing interpersonal confrontation. Of the cases in which outcomes were known, eight thrill cases and two mission cases resulted in a bias conviction. However, not surprisingly, of the cases that were unclassifiable—and arguably falling outside the concep- tion of the typical hate crime—only one resulted in a bias conviction (see Table 4). Thrill Of the 30 cases 13 (43%) were categorized as motivated by thrill. The cases appeared to have no clear precipitating event, and the vast majority of thrill cases involved more than one offender. Such cases usually involved juveniles (77%) and frequently involved property crimes (69%). Of 13 cases, 7 (54%) were motivated by bias against religion, with the majority evidencing anti-Jewish bias. In eight of the thrill cases at least one offender was convicted of a bias offense. 896 An example of a thrill case involved three juvenile offenders who spray painted swastikas and other graffiti (e.g., “f . . .”) on vehicles parked in the vic- tim's driveway. The victims were Jews and had decorated their house with Hanukkah decorations for the holiday. According to the investigation report, the victims expressed concern that they “were being targeted for some type of violence.” Case files revealed that the juveniles “just thought it would be funny” to paint swastikas. One juvenile erased his own graffiti and stated that he participated because he thought it would be “harmless fun.” Another thrill case involved three juvenile males and one adult male offender driving around throwing rocks and yelling out racial epithets at passersby. The racially offensive remarks included “n . . . ,” “spic,” “spic, I'm going to f . . . your mother,” and “go back to your own country.” According to the case files, the offenders denied racial prejudice. However, when asked to describe their behavior, they stated that they were playing “screamers” which they described as a game in which they drive “around to random people and scream gibberish at them or whatever is in our heads to scream or whatever is on the radio to get a reaction.” When asked why this particular location was chosen for “screamers,” one juvenile stated because the area “has everybody, Chinese, Black, Spanish, Native American, everybody.” However, when asked if he was a racist, the juvenile replied, “hell no.” According to the offenders, all minorities are not equally susceptible to being victimized and the offend- ers explained that the game does have rules; the victims off-limits for “scream- ers” are little children and the elderly. Retaliation Retaliatory cases are those in which the offender is responding to a real or perceived attack against members of their own group. The single retalia- tory case was in response to the 9/11 attacks in the United States and was directed toward an Islamic center. The center received a series of harassing and threatening answering-machine messages. The offender was charged with bias harassment. The offender admitted to making the call and stated that he was “angry beyond words” and that he “spewed some venom that I'm embarrassed by . . . it was a knee-jerk reaction.” Defensive McDevitt et al. (2002) described defensive cases as those in which the offender is clearly concerned with protecting his community from “those he considered to be outsiders or intruders” (p. 308). The following single case 897 provides an example of a defensive bias crime. The case involved an ongo- ing dispute between two members on a planning board. Both parties filed various complaints against each other. The case involved harassing answering- machine messages left by the offender that indicated the offender would drop the lawsuit if the victim removed herself from the planning board. The message stated, “We don't need Syrians on the planning board,” and “It will be sending a message to your people, and that [this town] is going to be tough on them.” Mission McDevitt et al. (2002) described the mission category as cases in which “the perpetrator seeks to rid the world of evil” (p. 309). Mission hate crimes are frequently committed by members of organized hate groups and may include offenders exhibiting symptoms of mental illness. Only four cases in the current study were categorized as mission. Two related cases categorized as mission involved youths that created their own hate group and had defined their own criteria for membership. The youth engaged in numerous acts of criminal mischief and other prop- erty crimes. Graffiti was sprayed on the nearby bridge and included various swastikas, pentagrams, and the phrase, “God sucks ass.” Furthermore, the youth knocked over a statue of the Mother Mary and removed the head of the statue. The juveniles scrawled graffiti at various locations, including a church and surrounding vehicles, and buildings, fences, and roadways. The graffiti was at times pointedly bias and included drawings of swastikas and pentagrams as well as phrases such as “N . . . s shall die,” “Nazi,” “white power n . . . s beware,” and so on. However, much of the graffiti was unrelated to bias and included phrases such as “big penises rock,” “S . . . sucks pussy,” “This car makes dingy noises,” “f . . . the world,” “God sucks ass,” and “Satan is my lover.” A few mission cases involved offenders exhibiting symptoms of mental illness. One case involved victims traveling on a highway. As the offender's vehicle approached, the offender threw a water bottle at the victim's vehi- cle. At the next light, the offender exited his vehicle and swung the drive shaft from his vehicle, striking the victim's car on the hood. The accused stated that he was working for the FBI and thought that the victims were Arabs and were harassing him. He stated he was an assassin assigned to kill Osama Bin Laden and he had recently hired gods to “take him out.” The case files indicated that the offender was delusional, exhibiting symptoms of mental illness. 898 Unclassifiable The following section describes cases in which bias seemed peripheral to the crime and the offender's actions appeared to be a direct response to the victim's actions immediately preceding the crime. Such cases were sim- ply unclassifiable and did not fit the typology. As a result, these cases cre- ate difficulties for prosecutors. This is problematic because more than one third of the cases referred from the bias unit fall into this category. All of the unclassifiable cases were comprised of adult offenders. Of the 11I unclassifiable cases, 10 consisted of personal crimes. Of the 23 cases in which at least one offender was charged with a bias crime, only one of the seven unclassifiable cases ended in a bias conviction for at least one offender. One case involved a victim and her 2-year-old grandson who pulled into the parking lot of a convenience store. As the victim parked, two offenders in a nearby vehicle stated, “Why didn't you park straight” and added, “Bitch, why can't you park straight, I can't get out, n . . . .” One offender entered the con- venience store to purchase a cup of coffee and returned to the vehicle. The vic- tim stated to the offender, “You need to tell your girlfriend to have more manners,” and the offender responded with racial slurs. The offender then approached the victim and threw coffee at the victim. There was no informa- tion in the case files indicating whether the offenders fall into any of the four categories, that is, thrill seeking, on a mission, defensive, or retaliatory. Rather, the precipitating event emerged as a direct result of the parking dispute. In another case, a Hispanic man arrived at the victim's yard sale intoxi- cated, loud, and boisterous. The accused stated, “I'll kick your mother f . . . ing cracker ass” and proceeded to kick and punch the victim. The accused then stated, “I kicked your ass white boy.” The victim reported that the responding officer refused to arrest the accused. The victim reported that the officer stated that the “fight was between two men” and that the “judge would throw the case out of court anyway.” The officer then gave the accused a ride away from the area. The victim called another officer to the scene. Though the verbal comments directed toward the victim were biased, there was no indication in the files whether the offender's goal was thrill seeking, retaliatory, mission, or defensive in nature. Subsequently, an inter- nal investigation was launched regarding the behavior of the initial responding officer. The case files revealed that the report filed by the initial responding officer made no mention of bias, but did mention the odor of alcohol and an argument about money. The final example of an unclassifiable case brings up an interesting issue concerning the prosecution of bias crimes: The victim of the alleged bias 899 crime was an on-duty police officer.6 The offender was involved in a motor vehicle accident and was subsequently arrested for driving under the influ- ence (DUI). The accused repeatedly threatened the transporting officers during transport. The offender made racial slurs and threatened to find out where the officer lived and to kill the officer's family. According to inves- tigative reports, the offender stated that he was “under the influence” at the time of the threats and that he “made a mistake.” The context of the case— the fact that the offender was in the custody of law enforcement at the time of the crime and made his remarks in response to his arrest—indicate that the offender was acting in response to the action of the officers rather than acting in a manner that can be classified as thrill seeking, mission, retalia- tory, or defensive. Discussion Due to the lack of empirical research on the prosecution of bias-motivated crimes, criminologists know very little about what kind of cases are success- fully prosecuted. This study focused on each of the cases prosecuted as a bias crime between 2001 and 2004 in one New Jersey county. As such, they were presumably cases in which both bias investigators and prosecutors believed were reasonably likely to result in a bias crime conviction. By examining cases that were actually prosecuted as bias crimes, rather than the larger pool of cases that potentially included an element of bias, this study aimed to exclude cases in which the bias element was most ambiguous. Although the cases were screened and identified as hate crimes, the cases did not easily fit the hate crime typology developed by Levin and McDevitt (1993). Generally, the cases designated as defensive, retaliatory, and mission were categorized with relative ease. However, the remaining one third of the cases was unclassifiable. Although the unclassifiable cases included some element of bias, this bias did not seem to be the primary motivation for the crime. The typology was developed to aid law enforcement in “investigating and identifying hate crimes”; arguably, the typology was designed to pro- vide an organized way of recognizing hate crimes (McDevitt, Levin, & Bennett, 2002, p. 305). The typology omits cases in which bias is a periph- eral component to the crime. It is recognized that if the typology were to be expanded to include such cases, it would ultimately water down the concept of a hate crime, rendering it virtually useless. Such an omission is consis- tent with Lawrence's (1999) suggestion that bias crime legislation should 900 target those offenders exhibiting racial animus rather than discriminatory selection, thereby excluding cases in which bias is peripheral to the motive. However, not all legislation is defined so narrowly. Case files revealed that, in this jurisdiction, there is still disagreement about whether bias need only be exhibited or be an integral element of the offense. Because such a large percentage of cases in the current study were unclassifiable, the typology did not appear to be a useful tool for categorizing cases in this jurisdiction. The typology may be most useful for law enforcement in those jurisdictions in which the law is defined rather narrowly. In the current study, cases in which bias seemed to be the primary, if not sole, motivation were most likely to end in a bias conviction. Similar to Martin's (1995) findings, determining the role of bias was sometimes prob- lematic. Even cases that displayed unambiguous, or included overwhelming, signs of bias such as painted swastikas or “KKKs,” frequently also included nonbias-related graffiti as well. For example, in one case, the offenders painted anti-Semitic graffiti along with the phrase, “I hate working here.” In such cases, the presence of nonbias graffiti may increase doubt among prosecutors (and jurors) that bias was the “true” motivation. Future research is needed in other jurisdictions to more fully understand the various types of cases prose- cuted as bias crimes. An additional concern regarding the application of the typology centers on cases categorized as mission, which involved evidence of mental illness, specifically psychotic symptoms, on the part of the offender. In general, the typology (as does the legal system) makes the assumption that offenders act rationally, with the exception of the mission category. Levin and McDevitt (1993, 2002, p. 91) proposed that the mission category includes those who tar- get an entire group of people, whether due to “severe mental illness,” includ- ing hallucinations and other psychotic symptoms, and/or allegiance to a hate group. A few cases in the current study involved offenders exhibiting paranoid delusions and other symptoms of psychosis. Conceptually categorizing the severely mentally ill along with (presumably otherwise rational) hate group members seems problematic. There is a qualitative difference between those who commit crimes as a result of mental illness and those whose crimes manifest as a consequence of their adoption of hateful ideology. As previously mentioned, a number of factors influence the way bias crime legislation is enforced across jurisdictions. The attitudes of law enforcement per- sonnel, training, bureaucratic organization, community context, and public sup- port may impact the extent to which policy is implemented (Haider-Markel, 2002; Jenness, 2007; Jenness & Grattet, 2005). Findings from the current study show that this particular jurisdiction has not only a detailed written 901 policy directed toward bias crimes but also has a dedicated team of full- time investigators assigned to enforcing the legislation. The investigators and prosecutors were enthusiastic, stating that their practices have fre- quently been praised as a desired model of bias crime law enforcement. However, despite the existence of a detailed policy and the effort exerted by law enforcers, ambiguities and difficulties enforcing bias crime legislation remain. Due to the variations in the enforcement of hate crime legislation, find- ings from this jurisdiction may not be generalized to other jurisdictions. Future studies should examine the application of the typology among a variety of jurisdictions, specifically those in which bias is defined as the sole, or the primary, motivation. Conclusion This research begs the question of at what point a typology is useful. Echoing Jacobs and Potter's (1998) concern regarding the very conception of a hate crime, must the typology provide for the vast majority of cases, only half, or only a fourth? A more optimistic take on the results may be that two thirds of the cases did indeed fit the typology. Furthermore, cases that fit the typology were more likely to result in at least one offender with a bias convic- tion than those that did not fit the typology. The findings suggest that the typol- ogy may be helpful only in identifying the most extreme examples of bias-motivated crimes. In this jurisdiction, the legal definition of a bias inci- dent considered suitable for prosecution is defined rather broadly. The net is cast even wider for the number of cases that have elements of bias motivation and undergo investigation. Hypothetically, if the concept of hate crime is widened to include the mere presence or expression of bias (or the typology is widened to more accurately include a substantial number of cases triggered by interpersonal confrontation), then a net-widening effect occurs. As a result, the distinguishing nature of bias crimes virtually vanishes. The net-widening effect also illustrates the concern regarding the unin- tended consequences of hate crime legislation (Franklin, 2002; Maroney, 1998). At its inception, hate crime legislation was focused on addressing vio- lence “connected to racism, nationalism, anti-Semitism, sexism, and hetero- sexism” (Jenness & Grattet, 2001, p. 32). Anti–hate crime advocates not only influenced policy designed to punish bias-motivated offenders as well as send a message to the larger community that bias-motivated crimes would not be tolerated (Jenness & Grattet, 2001). However, scholars were quick to voice 902 concerns about how the legislation would be enforced and who would be pun- ished (Franklin, 2002; Jacobs & Potter, 1998). Findings from the current study show that enforcement of the legislation applies to atypical offenders (e.g., mentally ill exhibiting psychotic symptoms) and atypical victims (e.g., on- duty police officers). Further research is needed to examine the types of cases prosecuted in other jurisdictions. Although much scholarly work has centered on various aspects of hate crimes, there is a paucity of research focused on cases actually prosecuted as hate crimes. Results indicate that the typology has limited usefulness in categorizing cases that are actually prosecuted as hate crimes in this juris- diction. A successful typology proves useful in a variety of empirical con- texts in which it is applied. Therefore, this research suggests at the outset that the everyday cases investigators and prosecutors encounter may be dif- ficult to classify into the widely cited and academically accepted hate crime typology. Rather than bias or hate, many cases appear to be primarily moti- vated by interpersonal confrontation between the parties who then use hate speech as a means of expressing anger or other emotion in an arguably impulsive manner. Future studies should examine the application of the typology among a variety of jurisdictions, specifically those in which bias is legally defined as the sole or primary motivation. Notes 1. The terms bias crime and hate crime will be used interchangeably. 2. Of the 30 cases referred for prosecution, the prosecutor's office was unable to locate files for 5 cases. Therefore, although descriptive information was available for all 30 cases, case outcome information was available for 25 cases. 3. McDevitt, Levin, and Bennett (2002) describe the hate crime typology as an “offender typology” (p. 303). In the current study, the unit of analysis is cases rather than offenders. The reason for this is that although each offender may have a different level of involvement within the same incident, the offenders shared the same bias motivation, and the case as a whole was categorized according to the typology. 4. Of the 25 cases for which case files were available, 23 (76.6%) resulted in at least one offender charged with bias intimidation, and 11 of these 23 cases resulted in at least one bias conviction. 5. Cases were classified as juvenile or adult based on whether the offender was juvenile or adult (18 years or older) at the time of the crime. Cases with more than one offender were coded according to the age of the majority of offenders. In cases in which there was a combination of juvenile and adult offenders, the age gap was generally not greater than 1 year. 6. The issue is, are police officers, while on duty, eligible to be victims of bias? Bias unit investigators repeatedly informed me that police officers cannot be victims of a bias crime while on duty, however, the case was prosecuted as a bias crime. Case notes revealed this exception: “It appears that the accused, though he had been drinking, went beyond the officer's uniform to attack him and his family personally by making threats that could be carried out as the accused knows where the victims live . . . .” 903 References American Prosecutors Research Institute.

Congressman Max Rose, who has strongly condemned discrimination against the Asian American community throughout the coronavirus pandemic, joined a bipartisan group of 150 Members of Congress in calling for the Attorney General to take action and publicly condemn discrimination and violence toward Asian Americans.
""The hate, violence, harassment and discrimination that has been hurled upon those in the Asian American community is gut-wrenching, horrible and wrong,"" Rose said. ""I hear from families and seniors that they're afraid to leave their homes, business owners forced to shut down, and far too many who have been victim to street attacks, verbal assaults, or racist fliers. It has no place in our community and we all must stand strong in solidarity against it. I'm proud to see so many of my colleagues join together from both parties to strongly condemn these actions, now the Administration must join the chorus.""
Since the beginning of the crisis, there have been numerous reports of Asian Americans being threatened, harassed, or assaulted. As of June 3, the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council reported 2,066 incidents of coronavirus-related discrimination. As a result, these communities, in addition to working to combat the coronavirus, are left fighting an additional frontthat of hate and injustice.
""We write to draw particular attention to an increase in verbal and physical attacks as well as discrimination towards Asian Americans who have been wrongly blamed for the virus' spread,"" wrote Rose and the bipartisan Members of Congress in a letter to Attorney General William Barr. ""We respectfully request that you publicly condemn acts of anti-Asian bias, and provide us with regular status updates regarding the steps the Department of Justice is taking and will take going forward to combat this behavior.""
Rose is a co-sponsor of the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which was introduced by fellow New York City Congressmember Grace Meng. The legislation seeks to provide greater federal government oversight of COVID-19 hate crimes, and require the Department of Justice to provide Congress with regular updates on the status of reported bias incidents.
Last month, Rose and local elected officials from South Brooklyn hosted a roundtable with Chinese-American business owners and community leaders to discuss efforts to support small businesses and the community through the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including against rising xenophobia and discrimination.",Bias Incident
17,/content/Bias_Incident_Lexis_1.DOCX,Newstex Blogs,2020-11-17,457 words,,Pamela Geller,,Jews Top Target of Hate Crimes in 2019,False,"Nov 17, 2020( The Geller Report: https://gellerreport.com Delivered by Newstex) American Jews were the religious group most targeted by hate crimes in 2019, the FBI reported Monday, facing more than 60 percent of anti-religious bias incidents. The number of anti-Semitic hate-crime incidents rose 14 percent in 2019, data from the bureau's annual hate-crime statistical report[1] show, with police departments reporting 953 events and 1,032 victims. 
That is 82 more incidents than in 2018, continuing a rising trend over the past half decade. Jews were in fact a leading target of hate crimes overall, regardless of motivation. In absolute terms, only more black Americans were victimized; on a per capita basis, only gay men and trans people were more likely to be targeted, a Washington Free Beacon analysis found. The shocking increase in reported bias incidents sums up a year in which a high-profile synagogue shooting and a spate of anti-Semitic violence in New York City took place. The latest figures suggest that anti-Jewish bias is not an isolated phenomenon but a widespread and growing threat to Americans' safety. Jewish leaders decried the uptick, calling for greater vigilance against anti-Semitism. 'Once again, the FBI hate crime statistics confirm what the Jewish community knows all too well: that violent antisemitism is a daily reality,' Joel Rubin, the executive director of the American Jewish Congress, told the Free Beacon. 'At the American Jewish Congress we have repeatedly called out rhetoric from both the left and the right that contributes to normalizing hate. Public officials have a special obligation to ensure that their statements and positions inhibit rather than inflame radicals.' 'Anti-Jewish hate crimes have been the most prevalent type of anti-religious hate-based crimes going as far back (1996) as the FBI has public figures on hate crimes,' Republican Jewish Coalition communications director Neil Strauss told the Free Beacon. 'Antisemitism isn't a political issue and doesn't emanate from one side of the political divide in particular. That is why the RJC has been at the forefront in calling out antisemitism on the left and the right. Jewish people, like all Americans, deserve to live without fear. We stand committed to making that possible.'The number of Jewish hate crime victims is particularly shocking in the context of Jews' small share of the population—less than 2 percent, according to the Pew Research Center. Out of every 100,000 Jews, 16 were victims last year, outpacing all but gay men (1.1 percent[2] of the population) and trans people (0.3 percent).

PLAY BALL
The World Series started this week, as two teams, the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Tampa Bay Rays, face off to win baseball's ultimate trophy. On one side, the Dodgers have talent, skill and depth as a result of having one of the largest payrolls in Major League Baseball. By contrast, the Rays have one of the smallest payrolls, but they have managed to defeat wealthy teams before, including the New York Yankees earlier in the postseason. While the 2020 baseball season has had its ups, downs and COVID-19 cases, there was some consistency as both these teams finished the regular season in first place in their respective leagues.
BIG 10 ACTION
The Big 10 football conference begins its shortened, eight-week-long season today with a matchup between the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the University of Illinois. While the teams are getting fired up, it's worth noting that this season almost didn't happen. On August 11, the conference announced that it was postponing all games this year and effectively ending these schools' football seasons before they even began. However, on September 15, the presidents of the member schools voted to hold the aforementioned season with a championship just in time to be included in the College Football Playoffs.",Bias Incident
19,/content/Bias_Incident_Lexis_1.DOCX,Targeted News Service,2020-08-15,464 words,,Targeted News Service,,CAIR-NY Calls for Hate Crimes Probe,False,"The Council on American-Islamic Relations issued the following news release on Aug. 14:
The New York chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-NY), the nation's largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, called on the NYPD to initiate a hate crimes probe after a teenage woman wearing a hijab was assaulted with a bottle of urine and Islamophobic slurs. The Civil Rights organization also called on the Commission on Human Rights to increase awareness on Islamophobia to stem the tide of bias incidents.
The victim of the alleged incident is Somaia Harrati, a 17-year-old American Moroccan Muslim woman that wears hijab, a religious head covering. According to the victim, on August 10 while waiting at a bus stop on Zerga and Westchester in the Bronx, young teenagers began throwing empty bottles at her and the small group of individuals at the bus stop. Ms. Harrati approached the teenagers, who were at the subway platform overlooking the bus stop and asked them to stop their conduct. Once Ms. Harrati returned to the bus stop, the teenagers threw a bottle of Mountain Dew that was filled with urine at her. The teenagers yelled at Harrati that the bottled was filled with urine. The teenagers yelled Islamphobic and disparaging slurs at Ms. Harrati, including calling her ""Bin Laden"" and yelling ""Allah Akbar"" during the incident. The teenagers also made denigrating comments about Ms. Harrati's hijab.
While Ms. Harrati called and waited on the NYPD, the teenagers entered the subway and left the scene. Once police arrived, they informed Ms. Harrati that there was nothing they could do and allegedly did not file a report. According to Ms. Harrati, the responding officers did not provide her any documentation or a police report number.
CAIR-NY Legal Director Ahmed Mohamed states:
""This incident is very disturbing on many levels. The NYPD needs to explain to the Muslim community and the public why Somaia was not provided a complaint number which indicates that the officers did not write up the incident. It is important for incidents like this to be appropriately classified. Accordingly, the NYPD must initiate a hate crimes probe. The Commission on Human Rights has a role to play in combating hate in our city, and we call on the Commission to raise awareness about Islamophobia and the struggles of Muslim women that chose to wear a hijab. These teenagers need to learn that this conduct is unacceptable and make amends by sincerely apologizing to Somaia and engaging in education about Islam, Islamophobia, and the beauty of the hijab.""
CAIR-NY's mission is to protect civil rights, enhance understanding of Islam, promote justice, and empower American Muslims.

The New York Police Department said Tuesday that they have identified 'SoHo Karen' and may charge her with assault, grand larceny or attempted robbery.
On Saturday a white woman who has been dubbed 'Soho Karen' approached black jazz artist Keyon Harrold and his 14-year-old son Keyon Jr in the lobby of the boutique Arlo Hotel in SoHo and accused the teen of stealing her cell phone. 
She pushed and grabbed the two and scratched Keyon Sr's hands in her fight for the phone, which she wrongly thought was hers. Her phone was reportedly found in an Uber and returned to her by the driver minutes after the squabble.
NYPD tells DailyMail.com says that 'Karen' has been positively identified and detectives are trying to locate her and the case is not being investigated as a bias incident.
Chief of Detectives Rodney Harrison said during a press briefing Tuesday: 'We believe that she lives out of state so we're trying to ascertain if she's still within the New York City area.' 
Harrison said the case was initially classified as harassment but it has since changed. 
'After we were able to get video, we're now looking to charge this individual with assault and maybe even look at grand larceny or maybe even attempted robbery,' he said.
Harrison said that Keyon Jr didn't suffer any injuries in the incident, but his father was scratched. 
'Our perpetrator initially started a verbal argument of this accusation and then tried to attack our teenager by grabbing for his phone, grabbing his leg and trying to tackle him. Our victim didn't suffer any injuries. But his father, who he was with, received slight injuries,' he said during a press briefing. 
On Monday the Manhattan District Attorney and NYPD announced they were investigating the incident. 
The family's lawyer Ben Crump is petitioning the Manhattan District Attorney's office to press charges including assault and battery. 
A source close to the hotel told DailyMail.com on Tuesday the manager involved in the incident has been placed on leave pending an internal investigation. 
On Tuesday morning Keyon Sr, a Grammy-winning musician, and his son appeared on Good Morning America, where the teen said he feared for his life. 
'I don't know what would have happened if my dad wasn't there. These past few days, still kind of shell-shocked, but I'm hanging in there,' Keyon Jr said on Good Morning America Tuesday.
'For me I was confused because I had never seen that lady ever and I didn't know what to do in the moment. That's why I was happy to have my dad here to help me,' he said. 
An Instagrammer last seen in a photograph on Instagram at the hotel six days ago has since posted a denial that she is the 'Karen' after being bombarded with abuse on social media accusing her of being the woman in the video. 
Cassandra Medina, a registered nurse from Staten Island, posted a message on her Instagram Sunday saying: 'I've been tagged all morning in this video and this is not me.It's not ok to be falsely accused on social media and I wouldn't want that happening to anyone.'
She then addressed Harrold in her post, saying: 'I hope you find truely (sic) who this person is because what she did is disgusting and this hotel should be held accountable.'
On Tuesday GMA host TJ Holmes asked Keyon Jr why he thinks the woman accused him and physically came after him. 
'I think it's because for me, I was a threat to her, and I think she was scared, so that's why when she saw me she like jumped on me and attacked me,' Keyon Jr said.
His father said the woman was 'all on him asking him for his phone immediately.'
After video of the incident cut off she 'basically tackled, she scratched me.'
Keyon Jr's mother Kat Rodriguez revealed she feared for her son's life when she heard about the incident. 
'For me, fear. Fear came in because my son, if his father wouldn't have been there, what would've happened to my son if the cops had been called? As a mother, when my son asks me ""Why me, mom,"" it just hurt,' she said.
'The toughest answer that a parent has to give their child - ""Son, unfortunately, it might be because you're black. You're no longer seen as a child,""' she added.
She says she wants to hear SoHo Karen's side to understand why she launched the attack.
When asked if he feared for his life in the attack, Keyon Jr said 'Yes.'
'I think because if you're by yourself, right? And you have no one to help you and you have no proof and it was just me by myself, it would have been a different story,' Keyon said. 
'We want charges because we have to send a message because this has larger societal implications. Think about how many black men have been accused by these Karens and they end up losing their liberty and losing their life sitting in prison,' attorney Ben Crump said on the morning show.
'We have a petition for the Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance Jr to bring charges against this woman for assault and battery,' he added.
Keyon was asked what he would say to the woman if he had the chance.
'At first I would expect an apology and two I would ask her why would she do something like this to a kid who has never met you at all. I would just ask, just why,' he said. 
Arlo Hotels apologized for the 'recent incident of baseless accusation, prejudice, assault against an innocent guest of Arlo hotel' on Instagram.
'No Arlo guest - or any person - should be subject to this kind of behavior. We want to apologize to Mr. Harrold and his son for this inexcuseable experience, and have reached out to them directly to express our sincere regret and to offer help in dealing with the traumatic event,' the statement said. 
Harrold shared the clip on Instagram saying the woman had checked out of the hotel on December 23, three days before the Saturday incident, and her phone was eventually returned by an Uber driver minutes after the confrontation. 
The one-minute-long video shows the woman and the hotel manager in the lobby with Harrold recording on his cell phone. 
'This is my phone,' Harrold's son, who is not seen in the footage, is heard telling the woman and the manager.
'You don't have to explain nothing to her,' Harrold tells his son.
The woman then points to the phone and tells the manager that the case is the same one that she has.
'That's mine,' she tells the manager. She then tells the manager: 'Get it back.'
Harrold responds to the woman, saying: 'Are you kidding me? You feel like there's only one iPhone made in the world?'
When the woman asks Harrold to see the phone, he replies: 'No, get a life.'
Harrold then tells the woman that she should use the Find My app, which helps locate missing Apple devices.
The woman then tells Harrold that the Find My app can only be accessed through the phone.
The video then shows the manager approach Harrold's son asking him to see the phone. 
'No, you can't,' Harrold tells the manager.
'I'm the manager of the hotel,' the manager tells Harrold, who replies: 'I don't care!'
During the exchange, the woman continues to encourage the manager to retrieve what she believes is her iPhone.
Harrold tries to plead his case, saying it wasn't plausible that his son would have someone else's phone since he just got to the lobby from the elevator.
'Didn't you see me just come downstairs out of the f***ing elevator?' Harrold tells the manager.
The manager protests, saying: 'I'm trying to help.' 
Harrold replies: 'My son has nothing to do with her.'
The woman once again repeats her demand to see the phone, saying: 'No, he's not leaving. Show me the proof.'
Harrold refuses and begins to walk away from the lobby toward what appear to be the elevators.
'You better get on,' Harrold tells the woman.
The woman, who appears to be highly distressed, walks toward Harrold and his son, saying: 'No, I'm not letting him walk away with my phone.'
While the video is not clear, the woman appears to lunge toward Harrold and his son.
In the next frame, she is seen on the ground as the manager helps her back to her feet.
'No, please get my phone back,' the woman begs the manager.
The video clip ends with the woman once again approaching Harrold in an attempt to get the phone. 
Harrold told The New York Times that the woman tackled his son and tried to look into his pockets before being physically separated from him. ",Bias Incident

Congressman Max Rose, along with State Senator Andrew Gounardes, Council Member Justin Brannan, and the Office of Assembly Member Peter Abbate, Jr., hosted a virtual roundtable with Chinese-American community and business leaders to discuss efforts to support small businesses and the community through the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including against rising xenophobia and discrimination.
""What has been happening in the past few months in terms of skyrocketing hate crimes and xenophobia against the Chinese- and Asian-American community as a result of COVID is not only disgusting, it's reprehensible and must utilize every tool at the federal, state, and city level to crack down on it,"" Rose said. ""As we talk about the economy, there's no secret that restaurants owned by Asian-Americans were some of the first to shut down. They need our help and I'm continuing to fight to ensure they have the relief and help they need and deserve.""
During the roundtable, Rose announced his support and co-sponsorship of the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which was introduced by fellow New York City Congressmember Grace Meng. The legislation seeks to provide greater federal government oversight of COVID-19 hate crimes, and require the Department of Justice (DOJ) to provide Congress with regular updates on the status of reported bias incidents.
Since the beginning of the crisis, there have been numerous reports of Asian-Americans being threatened, harassed, or assaulted. The pandemic has also fueled a rise in anti-Semitic incidents against the Jewish community, and has had adverse impacts on the LGBTQ community. As a result, these communities, in addition to working to combat the coronavirus, are left fighting an additional front--that of hate and injustice.
Rose has continued to fight for and prioritize the needs of small businesses. Earlier this month, the bipartisan Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act, which Rose co-sponsored, was signed into law and included many critical fixes for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). Following Congress passing additional funding for relief programs to help businesses and nonprofits, Rose called on four of the leading banks to prioritize the truly small businesses that are hurting most over larger corporations and businesses. Rose also testified before the House Committee on Small Business urging more safeguards to ensure federal funding goes to small and minority-owned businesses and nonprofits that need them most.

Nearly 15,900 law enforcement agencies reported a total of 7,314 incidents of bias- or prejudice-motivated crime in 2019 -- up from 7,120 in 2018 -- and 8,559 related offenses. As in past years, race was the primary motivation, followed by religion and sexual orientation. 
[READ:California Firearm Purchases, Concerns of Violence Are Up During Pandemic]
The number of hate crimes -- criminal offenses motivated by bias against the victim's race/ethnicity/ancestry, gender, gender identity, religion, disability or sexual orientation, according to the FBI -- varied by state, with California reporting the highest number: 1,221 bias-motivated crimes. More than 800 of those were categorized as crimes against people. The rest were against property, with 330 crimes categorized as vandalism. 
Following the Golden State with the most hate crimes were New York (618), New Jersey (478), Washington (664) and Texas (560). Texas was home to more than half of the hate-crime murders reported in 2019; 22 people were killed in El Paso during a race-motivated shooting in August -- the most lethal hate crime attack recorded by the FBI, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University--San Bernardino. 
Alabama reported zero hate crimes in 2019. Wyoming (6), Arkansas (10), Iowa (13), Mississippi (15) and Maryland (18) reported the next fewest. 
One factor impacting the state-by-state reporting is the number of agencies participating in this data collection. Law enforcement agencies vary in number, based on state population, and they aren't required to report hate crime statistics to the FBI. In Hawaii, for example, just one agency reported hate crime incidents to the FBI. That state agency covers approximately 975,000 people, according to the FBI; the state's population is 1.43 million. Meanwhile, California had 737 participating agencies covering its 39.5 million residents. 
Other findings from the FBI report: 
-- Of the 1,715 victims of anti-religious hate crimes, anti-Jewish bias led to the crimes that impacted 60.2% of the victims.
-- For single-bias hate crimes, 57.6% of victims were targeted because of their race/ethnicity/ancestry, 20.1% were targeted because of their religion and 16.7% were targeted because of their sexual orientation.
-- There were 4,930 victims of race/ethnicity/ancestry motivated hate crime among single-bias hate crime incidents in 2019, and 48.5% were victims of crimes driven by offenders' anti-Black or anti-African American bias.

""The FBI's report is another reminder that we have much work to do to address hate in America,"" Southern Poverty Law Center President and CEO Margaret Huang said in a statement. ""Each of these incidents represents the targeting of an individual or community for violence or vandalism because of their identity or personal characteristics.""

Fordham University's decision in 2016 to reject a chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine because it could cause potential ""polarization"" on campus violated the student organizers' rights, a new amicus brief joined by PEN America argues.
Fordham has argued in Awad v. Fordham University that it is not subject to the First Amendment as a private institution and well within its right to bar Students for Justice in Palestine. A New York judge rejected that argument in August 2019. Now on appeal in the New York Appellate Division, PEN America argues that despite Fordham's private status, the university still guarantees freedom of speech in its own university policies, statements, and mission. As Fordham's policy on bias-related incidents and hate crimes carefully notes, ""the expression of an idea or point of view may be offensive or inflammatory to others"" may not be a pretext to prohibit such speech from seeing the light. In fact, like many other peer institutions, Fordham's mission statement ""guarantees the freedom of inquiry required by rigorous thinking and the quest for truth.""
""Private universities should be in the habit of upholding free speech, not finding ways around it,"" said Jonathan Friedman, program director for campus free speech at PEN America. ""Rules for the formation of student groups should be consistent and content-neutral, not bent because one groups' views are seen as objectionable by administrators. Fordham's lopsided application of its own rules has resulted in the censorship of legitimate speech. However controversial, students should never have their views stifled--ideas in conflict are the nature of the academy.""

PEN America has previously examined the importance of free expression and open inquiry on college campuses in its 2019 report Chasm in the Classroom: Campus Free Speech in a Divided America. It has also developed guidance for a range of scenarios related to free speech at public and private universities in its Campus Free Speech Guide.

After condemning Facebook and Twitter for their history of biased incidents which they claim to be 'mistakes,' Lee called out a sinister pattern as an indictment of Big Tech bias. 'These mistakes, they may be mistakes, but they're mistakes that rhyme,' said Lee.[4] 'They may not repeat themselves, but they rhyme,' implying that the 'consistent theme' is one of censorship of 'Republicans, conservatives and pro-life activists.''There are instances in which your platforms are taking a very distinctively partisan approach and not a neutral one to election related content moderation,' Lee explained. He then recalled how Twitter suspended U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan[5]. Morgan was punished for tweeting: '@CBP &#38; @USACHEQ continue to build new wall every day. 
Every mile helps stop gang members, murderers, sexual predators, and drugs from entering our country. It's a fact, walls work.' Lee asked Dorsey point-blank: 'What exactly is hateful about Commissioner Morgan's tweet that I just read?' Dorsey responded that the platform's decision to suspend that tweet 'was a mistake.'Lee then locked his sights on Facebook, recalling an incident where Facebook censored political ads exposing the Biden-Harris campaign's 'views on late-term abortion.' He illustrated what happened to the post: 'The very next day, the third-party fact-checker issued a statement retracting the assessment, and retracting it as erroneous. However, it stunningly took facebook almost two more weeks, until October 29th, when voting had already started in many jurisdictions, to lift the ban on these legitimate ads, ads that the fact-checker had already declared a couple weeks earlier were erroneously taken down.'The timing for this hearing is fitting, considering Twitter[6] and Facebook's[7] constant censorship of posts related to the election. Senate Republicans had been itching for another chance to confront Twitter and Facebook about the censorship of the New York Post[8] story that claimed to expose alleged corrupt dealings of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden in Ukraine. A recent post-election poll[9] conducted by MRC found that 36 percent of Biden voters were not aware of this story. Mr. Zuckerberg, why did it take Facebook two week to correct this error?'Zuckerberg suggested that Facebook's late response was due to a 'mistake or delay.'Conservatives are under attack. Contact Facebook headquarters at 1-650-308-7300 and Twitter at (415) 222-9670, and contact your representatives and demand that Big Tech be held to account to mirror the First Amendment while providing transparency, clarity on 'hate speech' and equal footing for conservatives.

According to the New York Times[1], Obama said, 'I don't want a country in which the president of the United States is actively trying to promote anti-Asian sentiment and thinks it's funny. 
I don't want that. That still shocks and pisses me off.' In the article published on Sunday, the New York Times also reported that Obama had told an aide Trump has 'no idea what he's doing,' after a meeting between the two in 2016, and that Obama has been 'so determined to avoid uttering the new president's name that one aide jokingly suggested they refer to him as 'He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named' — Harry Potter's archenemy, Lord Voldemort.' President Trump has repeatedly[2] used[3] the term 'kung flu' to refer to the coronavirus, drawing condemnation[4] from former 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang and CBS News White House correspondent Weijia Jiang[5] — who said a White House staffer used the term in front of her. In March, President Trump was also confronted[6] by ABC News reporter Cecilia Vega on his use of the term 'China Virus.' 'Why do you keep calling this the Chinese virus?' asked Vega. 'There are reports of dozens of incidents of bias against Chinese Americans in this country. Your own aide, Secretary Azar says he does not use this term. He says ethnicity does not cause the virus. Why do you keep using this? A lot of people think it's racist.' Trump replied, 'Because it comes from China It's not racist at all. No, not at all. It comes from China, that's why. It comes from China. I want to be accurate.' Have a tip we should know?

""This incident felt like an attack on my identity and presence on campus,"" said the first anonymous student. The attack they referenced were messages written in chalk throughout parts of the UWL campus. Some of the messages written stated, ""UWL college republicans"" ""UWL backs the blue"" and ""If she breathes, she's a thot ratatatatot"" which one student suggested could be a slight towards the Black Lives Matter movement signs that say, ""I can't breathe."" The chalk messages were still seen days later.
The Racquet Press reached out to UWL college republicans for comment, and have not received a reply.
""I originally heard about the incident from friends, and then witnessed one of the chalking's outside of my dorm as I was walking down the stairwell to go to work,"" said the second anonymous student. ""The chalking that I saw read 'Trump 2020' but from what I was told there were more chalking's near the [Hoeschler Tower] and racist statements such as 'China did this' and statements against the Black Lives Matter movement like 'UWL Backs the Blue.'""
The third anonymous student said they were scared after seeing the chalk drawings. ""When I saw the 'Trump 2020' and 'UWL backs the blue' chalking on the sidewalk, I immediately felt fear. As a person who holds multiple marginalized identities, I understand how important it is to know that there are people out there who will support and stand in solidarity with me,"" they said. ""The Trump 2020, UWL backs the blue, etc. messages definitely did not make me feel safe. Quite the opposite, actually.""

The first anonymous student said, ""Since all the dorms are in a shelter-in-place order and classes are online for the time being, not a lot of students knew this happened. But, if campus had continued 'as normal', either this would've been a larger issue, or it would've never occurred.""
Data from The New York Times has shown that La Crosse County is one of the top COVID-19 hotspots, nationwide. UWL has had to move to online formats due to the large increase of positive cases among its student body.
The anonymous sources believe that the UWL student code of conduct was violated by the chalk drawing around campus. The UWL student code of conduct states, ""The student code of conduct is designed to help ensure a positive learning environment for all students at UWL. Students are held accountable for their academic and non-academic misconduct utilizing Wisconsin State Statue (UWS 14, 17, & 18), Office of Residence Life policy, University Police, and in coordination with other campus policies. At UWL, the misconduct process is rooted in Fairness, Accountability, and Compassion for Everyone . Through education, we believe the Student Code of Conduct can help students thrive at UWL.""
""No one is illegal on stolen land"" (Photo taken by anonymous source.)
In an attempt to change the rhetoric, other UWL students wrote social justice affirmations such as, ""you are on indigenous lands"" and ""Black Lives Matter"" in an act of counter-protest.

 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE / April 2002 McPhail / GENDER-BIAS HATE CRIMES GENDER-BIAS HATE CRIMES A Review BEVERLY A. MCPHAIL University ofTexas at Austin Currently, hate crimes and hate crime policy are receiving increased public and scholarly attention. Much of the attention has been focused on crimes committed out of bias toward a victim's membership in a group based on race, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity/national origin. However, more recently, gender has been included as a status category, often causing heated debate. This article looks at the history of the initial exclusion, then inclusion, of gender in the hate crime domain. The reasons for the uneasy fit of gender as a status category are recounted, as well as arguments both for and against inclusion of gender within the hate crime model. The problem of gender essentialism is examined, which results in the marginalization of the multiple category statuses of many women. The article con- cludes with implications for research, policy, and practice. Key words: violence against women, hate crimes, bias crimes, gender-bias hate crimes, sexual assault, domes- tic violence AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN is dragged to his death behind a pickup truck in Jasper, Texas. A young gay college student is beaten and left to die draped on a fence in Laramie, Wyoming. Four schoolgirls and their female teacher are shot to death by two male classmates at Westside Middle School in Jonesboro, Arkan- sas. Each of these horrific murders left the coun- try first reeling and then debating the causes and solutions to such violence. However, the three crimes were discussed in very different ways. The first two crimes are widely regarded as hate crimes and led to a national discussion on racismand homophobia, respectively. However, Jenness and Grattet (2001) noted the latter crime was treated very differently from the others. In contrast to these two incidents, the murder of four young girls in a Jonesboro, Arkansas schoolyard in March of 1998 generally has not been viewed as a hate crime, despite the revelation that the young boys in custody for the killings sought to shoot girls because it was girls that angered them. That is, they selected their victims on the basis of gender. Time Magazine (Labi, 1998) referred to it as a ""youth crime"" and Newsweek (McCormick, 1998) called it a ""schoolyard crime."" Because of this framing, the in- cident triggered a different set of legal and policy discussions, most often in terms of school violence and the debate over gun control.

TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE, Vol. 3, No. 2, April 2002 125-143 2002 Sage Publications The discrepancies between how these crimes were viewed, reported, and discussed illus- trates the present debate over including gender- bias-motivated violence under the rubric of hate crime definitions and pol- icy. The story of the inter- section between gender and hate crime policy has been tumultuous and controversial. The debate continues today. This article will exam- ine the intersection of gender and hate crime policy. Before discussing the specifics of gender, hate crime policy in gen- eral will be reviewed followed by a history of gender in hate crime policy. The current debate over whether gender fits within the hate crime paradigmwill be recounted with both sides of the controversy presented. The problemof gen- der essentialismwithin hate crime policy will be presented, which means examining the multi- ple status categories of women; for instance, how do we talk about hate crimes against women of color and lesbian women? The article will conclude with implications for policy, prac- tice, and research. HATE CRIME OVERVIEW It is beyond the scope of this article to provide a complete review of hate crime policy, which is incredibly complex and nuanced. However, it is helpful to have a basic understanding of the hate crime policy arena before looking at how gender fits within this domain. Although the term hate crime is new, the violence it describes is not. In cataloguing intergroup violence and conflict in the 20th century in his book Mass Hate , Kressel (1996) wrote, ""Blood has gushed so freely, and with such frequency, that one might consider the urge to kill one's neighbor an inborn characteristic of our species"" (p. 1). Al- though violence based on prejudice and bias is not new, the social movements that brought themto the forefront are more recently orga- nized. Hate crime policy emerged from a multi- tude of social movements including the civil rights movement, the women's rights move- ment, the gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgendered (GLBT) movement, and most recently, the crime victims' movement. Actually, the term hate crime is somewhat of a misnomer. It is difficult to operationalize hate, a 126 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE / April 2002 KEY POINTS OF THE RESEARCH REVIEW The category of gender was actively excluded fromhate crime policy during the early years of the policy process when social movements and advocacy organizations set the policy agenda. Gender as a status category was later added as the policy-making process matured and a policy tem- plate for hate crimes was institutionalized. Be- cause gender was already a standard subject of federal discrimination law, the status was folded in by policy makers rather than being actively pro- moted by women's groups. Hate crime policy in general remains controver- sial, although the status categories of religion, race, and ethnicity are largely established. The cat- egories of sexual orientation, gender, and disabil- ity have been more recently proposed and frequently debated. In some ways, gender as a status category fits the hate crime paradigm in that women are often dis- criminately selected as victims due solely to their gender, the assault is often unprovoked, no other motives (such as robbery) are involved, gender- based epithets are frequently used, there are long- termemotional and physical consequences, and women as a group are affected. In some ways, gender as a status category is deter- mined to not to fit the hate crime paradigm, most often due to the fact that women often know their attackers and that violence against women is so prevalent. Gender as a status category is often viewed in an essentialist way, ignoring the multiple statuses of the victimsuch as women of color and lesbian women. The effects of adding gender to hate crime policy are debatable. For some, such an addition is merely symbolic with little enforcement or over- sight. Alternatively, others believe if monitored and enforced, gender as a status category could provide new protections and increased options for women. Gender is increasingly part of the hate crime pol- icy template, which calls for a plan of action with regard to practice, policy, and research. The story of the intersection between gender and hate crime policy has been tumultuous and controversial. subjective human emotion, much as it is diffi- cult to characterize love. Instead, Lawrence (1999) described hate crimes as ""bias crimes""; that is, crimes committed as an act of prejudice: ""I use the term'bias crime' rather than 'hate crime' to emphasize that the key factor in a bias crime is not the perpetrator's hatred of the vic- timper se, but rather his bias or prejudice to- ward that victim"" (p. 9). Weisburd and Levin (1994) defined hate crimes as ""the offender's discriminatory use of violence to enforce a par- ticular social hierarchy that is biased against the targeted status hierarchy"" (p. 36). Hate crimes can be the result of hatred but also stemfroma perpetrator's stereotypical views of their victim and the community they represent, resentment, a desire to punish that victim and their commu- nity for alleged transgressions, feelings of power and control, a need to keep victims and their communities in their place, a need for a thrill or adventure, the need to affirmmasculin- ity and male bonds, and from multiple motives, and from motives the perpetrator may not even be aware of himself (Franklin, 1998; Levin & McDevitt, 1993). Bias crimes generally consist of two parts; that is, the basic crime (for instance, an assault or vandalism) and the motivation that inspired it. Lawrence (1999) described two models of bias crime--the ""discriminatory selection model"" and the ""animus model."" The former is based on a perpetrator's discriminatory selection of a vic- tim. In this model, ""it is irrelevant why an of- fender selected his victimon the basis of race or group; it is sufficient that the offender did so"" (p. 30). The animus model rests on the of- fender's hatred of the victim's actual or per- ceived group membership. Particular statutes criminalize one or the other or a combination of these two motivations. Which status groups are selected for coverage by hate crimes is a continuing debate and a fo- cus of this article. Jenness and Broad (1997) de- scribed such statutes: The protected statuses contained in hate crime legis- lation, in effect, articulate who does and does not qualify as a victim. In so doing, they also determine who is and is not entitled to legal recourse . . . there is a definite ranking of status provisions in hate crime law. (p. 42) Race, ethnicity, and religion are the most widely accepted, with disability being added later, and sexual orientation and gender categories being the most controversial and therefore included in some statutes and not in others. The anti-hate-crime movement has sought le- gal remedies for the problem of hate crime. Civil remedies and enhanced penalties were often adopted based on the supposition that hate crimes are not merely acts of violence against an individual but cause great harmto the victim's community specifically, as well as to the social fabric of our society more generally. Largely in response to social movement activism and pub- lic attention to several widely publicized hate crimes, by 1995, the federal government, 37 states, and the District of Columbia had passed hate crime laws (Jacobs & Potter, 1998). The passage of such laws has not been with- out controversy. Opponents of hate crime law cite a variety of objections including Constitu- tional challenges to the First and Fourteenth Amendments (free speech and equal protection, respectively); fears that such policies promote divisiveness and identity politics at the expense of unity; and problems with establishing moti- vation (Jacobs & Potter, 1998). However, propo- nents of hate crime policy believe, ""Because ra- cial harmony and equality are among the highest values held in our society, crimes that violate these values should be punished and must be punished, specifically as bias crimes"" (Lawrence, 1999, p. 167). Often proponents seek to ""send a message"" with hate crime laws that prejudice expressed in violent assaults or prop- erty damage will not be tolerated. POLICY HISTORY OF GENDER AND HATE CRIME As previously mentioned, social movement organizations have provided the primary impe- tus to much hate crime policy. These organiza- tions were outraged by the violence perpetrated against their members. Keeping informal statis- tics was often a way to begin to address the problem. However, as advocacy groups began to gather momentum and political clout, the or- ganizations frequently turned to the govern- ment for action and remedies. McPhail / GENDER-BIAS HATE CRIMES 127 To begin to address the problemof hate crime, the prevalence of the problem was im- portant to establish. The Coalition on Hate Crimes Prevention was formed to sponsor the Hate Crimes Statistics Act (HCSA) at the federal level, which would require the U.S. Attorney General to gather and publish hate crime statis- tics on selected groups. The coalition was com- posed of civil rights, religious, peace, gay and lesbian, and ethnic groups (Jenness & Broad, 1997). Women's groups were noticeably absent. The first Congressional hearings on hate crime oc- curred in 1985 and cen- tered on the following three designated core cat- egories: race, religion, and ethnicity. However, between the introduction of the HCSA in 1985 and its passage in 1990, a pro- cess termed domain expan- sion occurred. Jenness and Grattet (2001) defined do- main expansion as ""when claimsmakers offer new definitions for and thus extend the bound- aries of the phenomenon under discussion"" (p. 54). In 1986, congressional hearings were held on antigay violence due to the influence and participation of GLBT agencies and organiza- tions, which resulted in the phrase ""homosexu- ality or heterosexuality"" being added to the bill before its passage in 1990. Despite the process of domain expansion, gender was not added at this time. At a HCSA hearing in 1988, Molly Yard, then-president of the National Organization for Women (NOW), submitted written testimony to be included in the record (Yard, 1988). Yard sought to amend the HCSA by adding gender as a protected cate- gory. She drew on feminist theory and research to demonstrate that the majority of violence committed against women occurs at the hands of men, often the result of misogyny. Yard de- scribed rape and heterosexual domestic vio- lence as tools of political oppression meant to keep women subordinate. She also included vi- olence against abortion providers and clinics as falling under the domain of hate crime. She noted two states already had included gender in their hate crime laws, both California and Min- nesota. Yard described the many parallels be- tween hate crimes and violence against women. She noted the irony that other social movement groups often used rape as an analogy for the harms that hate crimes do and yet refused to add protections for women, who are primarily the victims of rape. Yard stated, Just as ethnic, religious, homophobic, and racist vio- lence is motivated by hate, so also are rape, wife abuse, and anti-abortion terrorismand a host of other crimes directed at women. Until we accept this concept as a nation and act on the obvious, we can- not truly understand the scope and misogyny in American society and begin to eradicate the problem and eliminate the tragic and shameful results. (p. 17) Despite her testimony, gender as a category was not adopted. An editorial in a women's advocacy newslet- ter documents the deliberate exclusion of both the status category of gender fromthe HCSA and women's organizations from the policy- making process. In the winter of 1989, the National Organization for Women and the National Coalition Against Domes- tic Violence sought to rectify the exclusion of women fromthe bill through a series of meetings with the Coalition on Hate Crimes. Aside from the absence of any women's groups, the Coalition on Hate Crimes is an otherwise broad coalition of civil rights, reli- gious, peace, gay, and ethnic rights groups. In re- sponse to the women's arguments for inclusion, the member organizations of the Coalition on Hate Crimes were polled. They agreed unanimously that they would not support a Hate Crimes Bill that in- cluded gender. The Hate Crimes Coalition then can- celled all future meetings with the women's rights groups. (de Santis, 1990, p. 1) The reasons offered for the exclusion of women were both strategic and ideological. For in- stance, coalition members feared that adding gender would delay passage of the bill and sug- gested that gender be considered for inclusion at a later date (Copeland & Wolfe, 1991). Other rationales for excluding gender included fears that inclusion would open the door for other groups such as age and disability; would make the statistics-gathering requirement too cum- bersome due to the prevalence of violence 128 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE / April 2002 The first Congressional hearings on hate crime occurred in 1985 and centered on the following three designated core categories: race, religion, and ethnicity. against women; and that women do not fit the hate crimes paradigm because many of them know their attackers (Copeland & Wolfe, 1991). Apparently, an internal memorandum pre- pared by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) was influential in laying out the arguments both for including and excluding gender as a cate- gory (Freeman, 1990); however, the ADL does not make this document public today. Angelari (1994) commented on the Coalition's stance. Ironically the Coalition argued that ""without the in- clusion of sexual orientation in the act, there would be two standards. Crimes against gays and lesbians would be viewed as less significant, less pervasive, and less reprehensible than crimes motivated by ra- cial, religious, or ethnic prejudice."" That a coalition of religious, civil rights, and gay and lesbian organi- zations should fail to see that their actions relegated crimes against women to the same secondary posi- tion illustrates one of the major obstacles that women's advocates must overcome before violence against women will be treated as a hate crime. (p. 85) Therefore, gender was not included as a cate- gory for protection in the HCSA that passed in 1990, and statistics on gender-bias-motivated crime are not reported at the federal level with other hate crimes. Disability, both mental and physical, was added as a category in 1994 under a provision of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act (FBI, 1999a). Gender was often omitted at the state level as well. The ADL formulated a model statute in 1981 that was adopted by many states. How- ever, the statute did not include gender as a sta- tus category. This occurred in spite of the fact that the first hate crime law passed in the United States was in California in 1978, which included gender as a category. Perhaps due to its exclusion fromthe HCSA, 2 years later, Congress sought to address vio- lence against women in a separate bill, the Vio- lence Against Women Act (VAWA), which sub- sequently passed in 1994. The bill had multiple provisions including funding for victimser- vices, education, and training for members of the criminal justice system. The law also con- tained a historic civil rights provision, Title III, which declared for the first time that ""violent crimes motivated by the victim's gender are dis- criminatory and violate the victim's federal civil rights"" (Goldscheid & Kraham, 1995, p. 505). Al- though not specifically termed hate crime, this was the effect of Title III. Unfortunately, the U.S. Supreme Court declared this section of the VAWA unconstitutional in 2000. United States v. Morrison et al. held, by a 5-4 ruling, that Con- gress did not have the authority to legislate the civil rights provision under the basis of the ei- ther the Commerce Clause or the Fourteenth Amendment, which Congress had cited as sources of federal authority (United States v. Morrison et al. , 1999). In 1994, Congress passed a sentence enhance- ment law, the Hate Crimes Sentencing Enhance- ment Act of 1994 (HCSEA), which called for en- hancing sentences by no less than three offense levels for hate crimes. For the first time in fed- eral policy, the list of protected statuses in- cluded gender. Currently before Congress is the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act (for- merly termed the Hate Crimes Prevention Act) that seeks to expand hate crime coverage for three categories, gender, sexual orientation, and disability, as well as expanding the application of hate crime law to a greater sphere than cur- rently permitted. In a Senate hearing on this bill, gender as a status category was debated with several groups specifically addressing the in- clusion of gender including the Center for Women's Policy Studies, the NOW Legal De- fense and Education Fund, and GenderPAC (Combating Hate Crimes, 1999). Jenness and Grattet (2001) described the early policy process in which social movement orga- nizations were critical in defining the problem of hate crimes, specifying target status catego- ries to be included, and advocating for legal so- lutions. Women's organizations were not active in the process, sometimes even being deliber- ately shut out, as previously described. How- ever, a second wave of hate crimes policy mak- ing commenced that allowed gender to be added as a category in the VAWA, HCSEA, HCPA and more than 20 states (for a listing of states, see Lawrence, 1999, pp. 178-189). This top-down addition of gender can be attributed to the fact that gender was already a standard subject of state and federal discrimination law and, thus, became folded into hate crime policy by lawmakers rather than grassroots activists. McPhail / GENDER-BIAS HATE CRIMES 129 As part of this move to increasingly include gen- der as a status category, in 1996, the ADL added gender to its model hate crime statute (ADL, 1999). In the current hate crime policy arena, gender is often likely to be on the list of pro- tected statuses in proposed legislation. Earl and Soule (2001) found that states that had previously passed hate crime law were less likely to go back and add gender as a category. Looking at various factors that affected whether a state included gender in their hate crime law, Earl and Soule found high issue salience, high per capita income, and a low non-White population were predictors of the in- clusion of the status cate- gory of gender in the state statute. Also, states in the Pacific Northwest were more likely to include gender than southern states. When Steven M. Free- man, director of the ADL Legal Affairs Department and author of the 1990 ADL internal memoran- dum, was asked why his organization first excluded and then included gender as a category, he (Steven M. Freeman, personal communication, March 24, 2000) re- sponded, It would not be accurate to say that gender was first excluded, and then we had a change of heart. It would be more accurate to say that after we had some experience with the statute, the question was raised internally as to whether it should be broader than originally drafted. When we brought to our lay leadership the question of whether to include gen- der, the vote was affirmative. Freeman (Steven M. Freeman, personal com- munication, March 24, 2000) also offered the fol- lowing caveat: I would also point out that including ""gender"" as a category is different than including ""women,"" even though it is obvious that in most gender-based hate crimes, the victims are women. We regard it as le- gally and politically significant that people of differ- ent races, religions, national origins, sexual orienta- tions, and genders are covered by our language-- not merely minorities. Freeman's point is well taken. Although not widely acknowledged in the media, hate crime law protects people of any race, ethnicity/na- tional origin, all sexual orientations, religions, and both genders, no matter whether they are in the majority or minority. Therefore, men are protected when they are targeted due to their gender, as are women. In a newspaper search, only two instances were found in which crimes were successfully prosecuted on the basis of gender bias (Jordan, 1994; Perry, 2000). According to J. McDevitt (personal communication, October 4, 2001), the bar is being raised for prosecuting gender bias motivated crimes. For instance, in Massachu- setts, the criteria for prosecution require that ep- ithets uttered during the commission of the crime denigrate women as a class and that at least two restraining orders have been filed on a perpetrator by two different persons for hate crime charges to be filed in a domestic violence case. The history of the gender status category within the hate crime model is one of first exclu- sion and then gradual inclusion as hate crime policy became institutionalized. However, the inclusion of the category remains more sym- bolic than realized as it is rarely invoked and re- mains controversial. Less than one half of the states include gender in their hate crime laws. For many, the gender category remains an un- easy fit in the hate crime model. FITTING GENDER INTO THE HATE CRIME PARADIGM Although gender is frequently becoming a part of the hate crime policy template, its fit within the hate crime paradigm remains contro- versial. Weisburd and Levin (1994) noted, ""The theoretical fit between gender-motivated crimes of violence and traditional bias crimes is concedingly not an exact fit, but we believe it is a substantial one"" (p. 42). Following are reasons it is not an exact fit and arguments for both its ex- clusion and inclusion. 130 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE / April 2002 The history of the gender status category within the hate crime model is one of first exclusion and then gradual inclusion as hate crime policy became institutionalized. However, the inclusion of the category remains more symbolic than realized as it is rarely invoked and remains controversial. Reasons for an Uneasy Fit One reason gender fits less easily within a hate crime paradigm is the simple fact that it came later in time in the hate crime policy- making process. As mentioned earlier, the triad of race, ethnicity, and religion are considered ""core"" or ""classic"" status categories. The U.S. Attorney General charged the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with collecting hate crime statistics in accordance with the HCSA's man- date. To collect the data, the FBI had to develop guidelines to establish which criminal acts con- stitute bias crimes (FBI, 1999b). The agency built the guidelines around the statuses covered in the HCSA at that time; that is, race, religion, sex- ual orientation, and ethnicity/national origin. The guidelines direct investigators to assess specific factors in attributing bias. A few of the guidelines are (a) certain objects, items, or things that indicate bias were used (e.g., the of- fenders wore white sheets with hoods covering their faces or a burning cross was left in front of the victim's residence); (b) the victim was en- gaged in activities promoting his/her race, reli- gion, disability, sexual orientation, or ethnicity/ national origin (e.g., the victim was a member of the NAACP or participated in gay rights dem- onstrations); and (c) the incident coincided with a holiday or date of particular significance relat- ing to race, religion, disability, sexual orienta- tion, or ethnicity/national origin (e.g., Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Rosh Hashanah, and so forth) (FBI, 1999b). Although the guidelines give concrete exam- ples that refer to race, religion, and sexual orien- tation, none of the examples presented for clari- fication refer to gender. Subsequent federal training manuals also did not mention gender (see for example, McLaughlin, Brilliant, & Lang, 1995). As a result, the racial animus model be- came the prototypical hate crime and the racial animus offender became the prototypical of- fender (Wang, 1997). The ""typical"" hate crime is often used as a measure by police officers who often compare the crime to a typical hate crime to see if it meets certain criteria; that is, no prov- ocation by the victim, a specific target, no prior encounter between victims and perpetrator, and accompanying derogatory remarks (Boyd, Berk, & Hamner, 1996). Therefore, one reason gender fits less well, at times, into the hate crime paradigmis merely because the policy was tai- lored around the inclusion of the other spe- cific status categories and the exclusion of gender. The status category of gender comes in as a second-tier hate crime, which may allow it to be treated differently, and perhaps not as seri- ously as the top tier hate crimes of race, religion, and ethnicity/national origin. It is also interesting to note that the FBI deter- mined that it was not necessary to create new crime categories but instead collect additional information, primarily on bias motivation, on crimes currently reported to the Uniform Crime Report (UCR) program(FBI, 1997). Ironically, 1 of the 11 traditional offenses named included ""forcible rape."" Because under the HCSA the category of gender was not recognized as a sta- tus category, the rape of a woman is not a hate crime unless the victim is sexually assaulted be- cause of the perpetrator's bias due to her race, religion, ethnicity/national origin, sexual ori- entation, disability, or religion. Other reasons why gender-bias crimes are of- ten not viewed as hate crimes are more struc- tural and represent institutionalismsexism. As Choundas (1995) explained, ""Habitual precon- ceptions, unexamined assumptions, and un- considered judgments--as invidious and damaging as more deliberate prejudices when finally implemented into discriminatory disad- vantaging--are the evasive phenomena most reliably suspected as yielding the exclusion of gender-crime victims from enhanced protec- tion"" (p. 1162). For instance, society's continued belief in rape myths and separation of the public and private spheres continue to cause violence against women to be seen in a different, and of- ten less serious, light. A painful example is dem- onstrated by the words of Senator Orin Hatch (R-Utah) during a Congressional hearing on the VAWA (cited in Gaffney, 1997): Say you have a man who believes a woman is attrac- tive. He feels encouraged by her and he's so moti- vated by that encouragement that he rips her clothes off and has sex with her against her will. Now let's say you have another man who grabs a woman off some lonely road and in the process of raping her says words like, ""You're wearing a skirt! You're a McPhail / GENDER-BIAS HATE CRIMES 131 woman! I hate women! I'm going to show you, you woman!"" Now the first one's terrible. But the other's much worse. If a man rapes a woman while telling her he loves her, that's a far cry fromsaying he hates her. A lust factor does not spring fromanimus. (p. 259) In this case, clearly rape myth acceptance and ignorance by policy makers play a role in not understanding gender-based violence. The so- cialization of sex roles, gender stereotypes and expectations, the historic legacy of minimizing violence against women, and the male justifica- tion of rape all play a part in not recognizing vi- olence against women as a hate crime. Choundas (1995) offered two additional rea- sons that cause people to miss seeing violence against women in the same light as racial or reli- gious prejudice: its preva- lence and the fact that women constitute half the population. These two factors make violence against women look like ""essentially randomand unrelated manifesta- tions"" (p. 1082). When women make up more than half the population, they do not fit the model of a powerless minority. Another reason for not seeing women as fit- ting a hate crimes model is the acceptance of lib- eral rather than radical feminist perspective to explain violence against women. Largely due to the work of liberal feminists, violence against women has received increased attention, fund- ing, and legal reform. However, the liberal femi- nist perspective focuses on gaining equality with men in the public sphere, often without ex- plicating the root causes of the inequalities. However, a radical feminist perspective ac- knowledges the existence of a patriarchy in which violence is used as a tool of male oppres- sion. For instance, Brownmiller (1975) wrote, Fromprehistoric times to the present, I believe rape has played a critical function. It is nothing more or less than a conscious process of intimidation by which all men keep all women in a state of fear. (pp. 14- 15) The radical feminist perspective is not widely accepted by policy makers and hate crime ac- tors, leading to the conceptualization of vio- lence against women as personal and individual, not political. A radical feminist per- spective more firmly situates the category of gender within the hate crime paradigm, whereas a liberal feminist perspective primarily seeks legal safeguards without addressing the underlying causes or motivations of violence against women. Arguments Against Gender Fitting in a Hate Crime Paradigm There are many arguments made why gender should not be included as a category in hate crime policy. Opponents of gender inclusion of- ten fail to see gender fitting the standard bias crime model; that is, ""the victim is attacked be- cause he [sic] possesses the group characteris- tic"" (Lawrence, 1999, p. 14). Hate crime logic often posits that victims are interchangeable and that victims have little or no preexisting re- lationship with the perpetrator. The fact that many female victims know their attackers pre- cludes some advocates and policy makers from fitting rape and domestic violence into a hate crime model. However, Lawrence (1999) pro- vided a helpful rebuttal of this assertion. The existence of a prior relationship between victim and perpetrator, moreover, is not incompatible with the existence of a bias crime. The lack of prior rela- tionship may be a description of most bias crimes, but it is not a sine qua non for all bias crimes. (p. 16) Unfortunately, many hate crimes are perpe- trated on neighbors and coworkers. Making a prior relationship a disqualification of hate crime status would exempt these crimes as well. There is a long history of a prior relationship between an offender and victimcausing vio- lence against women to be viewed in a different, less serious, light. For instance, traditionally, most state sexual assault laws included a ""mari- tal rape exemption"" clause that specifically ex- cluded the husband fromprosecution for raping his wife. The use of a prior relationship to ex- clude hate crime determination is just the latest 132 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE / April 2002 The fact that many female victims know their attackers precludes some advocates and policy makers from fitting rape and domestic violence into a hate crime model. in a long line of justifications for using a woman's acquaintance with her attacker to min- imize and rationalize violence. In response, Pendo (1994) stated, ""In fact, the previous rela- tionship makes the crime more heinous because the sense of connection and shared community implied in social familiarity is viciously shat- tered"" (p. 168). How far this standard can be pushed was demonstrated in a successful prosecution of gender-motivated violence under the California hate crime law. In this case, the perpetrator was accused of attacking five women. In four of the attacks, the man, who was unknown to all of the women, approached them with a question or a comment. The women generally responded with a few words before moving away, and then were physically assaulted by the perpetrator. In the fifth attack, the man knocked a female victim to the ground without either of themsaying a word, causing her to suffer a fractured skull. Al- though there was a pattern of discriminatory se- lection of women for attack, the jury made a dis- tinction between the five cases. The assault in which the woman spoke not a word to him was deemed a hate crime, and the other four assaults were termed ""misdemeanor battery."" Because the other four women had exchanged a few words with the assailant, they were determined to have ""spurned his advances"" and therefore the perpetrator's motivation was deemed their rejection of himrather than his bias toward women (Perry, 2000). Prosecutor Deputy Dis- trict Attorney Hector Jimenez, head of the hate crime prosecution unit, reported that the mixed verdict revealed the difficulty of using the hate crime statute in attacks on women (Perry, 2000). Lesbian battering is also an uneasy fit into the hate crime paradigm. Not only does it have the same intimacy element problems that hetero- sexual violence does, in addition the perpetra- tors are of the same gender and the same sexual orientation. This would generally preclude it from being termed a hate crime because the FBI guidelines state that the perpetrator and victims must be from different status categories (FBI, 1999b). However, the primary distinction of a hate crime is that it was committed due to bias against the group. In a review of the literature, West (1998) found that battering within lesbian relationships is often caused by the same factors as within heterosexual violence, such as sub- stance abuse, a family history of violence, de- pendency/autonomy issues, and power imbal- ances. However, an untested but strongly suggested underlying dynamic is that of inter- nalized homophobia (West, 1998). That is, soci- etal discrimination and hatred of homosexuals is turned inward, and then outward, in acts of violence toward a lesbian partner. With this un- derstanding, lesbian battering could fit the hate crime paradigm; that is, the violence was a re- sult of bias against a group, despite the fact that the perpetrator belongs to the same group. Such an argument, however, would be a stretch of the hate crime paradigm and most likely deemed an uneasy fit, as is gender generally. Heretofore, hate crimes due to sexual orientation bias is largely recognized, researched, and discussed when heterosexuals target GBLT victims. Clearly, lesbian battering is an area that war- rants further exploration and discussion with regard to its fit in the hate crime framework. Another argument often cited in the dis- avowal of gender as a status category is the fact that there are already special laws that address violence against women, such as sexual assault and domestic violence laws. Although this is true, these laws do not always provide the re- dress and justice sought by survivors of vio- lence. For instance, the report The Response to Rape: Detours on the Road to Equal Justice, pre- pared by the majority staff of the Senate Judi- ciary Committee (1993), found that (a) more than half of all rape prosecutions result in either a dismissal or acquittal; (b) a rape prosecution is more than twice as likely as a murder prosecu- tion to be dismissed and 30% more likely to be dismissed than a robbery; (c) almost one quarter of convicted rapists are not sentenced to prison but instead are released on probation; and (d) 98% of rape victims will never see their at- tacker apprehended, convicted, and incarcer- ated. Although laws are in place, and certainly are an improvement over even a decade ago, clearly the laws as they stand do not adequately address issues of violence against women. Adding gender as a category in hate crime laws could give prosecutors and police officers new tools to secure convictions, give convicted of- McPhail / GENDER-BIAS HATE CRIMES 133 fenders enhanced penalties, and give the public a better understanding of the motivations of much of the violence committed against women. Declaration of the unconstitutionality of the VAWA Title III civil rights provision only adds to this argument. Another reason given for exclusion of gender as a category is less ideological and more logisti- cal. For instance, some opponents fear the addi- tion of gender into hate crime categories will overwhelmdata-collection efforts. Goldscheid (1999) responded to that argument, Perhaps the principal or underlying objection to treating domestic violence and sexual assaults as civil rights cases is the staggering number of those crimes committed each year. Yet it would be an ab- surd perversion of our justice systemif the preva- lence of a problembecame the justification for ignoring it. (p. 151) A related fear is that with violence against women being so prevalent, including gender as a status category would make the other status categories look less important and frequent in comparison. The final argument most often given for the exclusion of gender concerns the perpetrator's motivation. That is, some argue that men who attack and assault women do not necessarily hate them. Although this can be true, it is true for all other status categories as well. As previ- ously addressed, ""hate"" crime is less about hate than bias or prejudice. Weisburd and Levin (1994) noted, ""The key to bias crime categorization is not really about the hateful 'specific intent' of the offender, but rather the offender's discrimina- tory use of violence to en- force a particular social hierarchy that is biased against the targeted status category"" (p. 36). Jenness and Grattet (2001) re- ported that recent judicial decisions on hate crime cases have shifted the fo- cus fromthe offender's motivation to the offender's discriminatory se- lection of his victim. Women are both discriminatorily selected on the basis of their gender and also due to animus, in this case, misogyny, as well as other motiva- tions. In one report of the motives of rapists (Scully & Marolla, 1985), perpetrators admitted a variety of motivations, many of which fell into either the discriminatory selection model or the animus model, or both. Several of the stated rea- sons included motives of power, collective lia- bility, and sexual access to unwilling women, as well as recreation, adventure, or a fantasy come true. The authors noted, We found that rape was frequently a means of re- venge and punishment. Implicit in revenge-rapes was the notion that women were collectively liable for the rapists' problems. In some cases, victims were substitutes for significant women on whom the men desired revenge. In other cases, victims were thought to represent all women, and rape was used to punish, humiliate, and ""put them in their place."" In both cases, women were seen as a class, a category, not as individuals. (p. 261) Also, it is important to note that in other types of hate crimes, the motives are mixed as well and not always about hate. For instance, Frank- lin's (1998) interviews with men who had per- petrated assaults on gay men found ""multiple determinism"" rather than simple accounts of motivation such as hate or repressed homosexu- ality. Men used this crime for ""demonstrating their masculinity, garnering social approval, and alleviating boredom"" (p. 19). Franklin com- pared the similarities between men who are ""gay-bashers"" and men who rape women be- cause, in both groups, the offenders often act in a peer context in which the victimis an object, ""a dramatic prop, a vehicle for ritualized con- quest"" (p. 12). Our society in general seems reluctant to la- bel male violence against women due to ""hate."" Individual mental or moral defects in the man or provocation by the woman are much more readily accepted by laypersons. Pharr (1990) noted an irony in this, ""'Man-hater' is a com- mon expression but 'woman-hater' is not, de- spite the brutal evidence of woman-hating that 134 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE / April 2002 Our society in general seems reluctant to label male violence against women due to ""hate."" Individual mental or moral defects in the man or provocation by the woman are much more readily accepted by laypersons. surrounds us: murder, rape, battering, incest"" (p. 3). Arguments for Gender Fitting in a Hate Crime Paradigm Violence against women fits the hate crime paradigm when women are selected as victims due to their gender (discriminatory selection model) or due to the perpetrator's hatred of women (animus model). In either case, women are targeted because they are women. Many crimes committed against women fit these mod- els, such as rape, domestic violence, and mur- ders of women in which men are the primary perpetrators and women the primary victims. One criteria of a hate crime is that offender and perpetrator(s) are fromdifferent groups. Although same-sex violence occurs, violence against women is primarily committed by men. However, just like any other crime, the facts of the case must be weighed to make a judgment of whether it meets the criteria of hate crime. The formulation of violence against women as hate crime fits with radical feminist theories of violence that emerged with the women's movement. One of the major successes of the women's movement was transforming the conceptualiza- tion of violence against women from a personal problemof individual men to a political process meant to subordinate women. MacKinnon (1991) presented the radical feminist perspec- tive when she stated, ""Women are sexually as- saulted because they are women; not individually or at random, but on the basis of sex, because of their membership in a group de- fined by gender"" (p. 1301). Caputi and Russell (1992) term the murder of women femicide, that is, ""the most extreme form of sexist terrorism, motivated by hatred, contempt, pleasure, or a sense of ownership of women"" (p. 15). What may be ""new"" arguments for many actors within the hate crime policy domain are actually old arguments within the feminist movement. This hatred of women and the discriminatory selection of women for violence meets the broad ideological basis for hate crime. One horrific in- cident of violence against women is frequently held up as the hallmark of gender-biased hate crime. The crime occurred in Montreal, Canada, on December 6, 1989, at the University of Mon- treal. Caputi and Russell (1992) described the massacre. On that day, 25 year-old combat magazine aficio- nado Marc Lepin suited up for war and rushed the school of engineering. In one classroom, he sepa- rated the women from the men, ordered the men out, and, shouting, ""You're all fucking feminists,"" opened fire on the women. During a half-hour ram- page, Lepin killed 14 young women, wounded 9 other women and 4 men, and then turned the gun on himself. A three-page suicide note blamed all of his failures on women, whom he felt had rejected him and scorned him. Also found on his body was a hit- list of 15 prominent Canadian women. (p. 13) This horrific crime is almost unanimously agreed to be a hate crime and opened the door for viewing other violence against women as gender-bias hate crime. The rape of women is almost always a hate crime, one exception possibly being statutory rape. Senator Joseph Biden (D-Delaware), pri- mary sponsor of the VAWA, stated, ""Theo- retically, I guess, a rape could take place that was not driven by gender animus, but I can't think of what it would be"" (cited in Gaffney, 1997, p. 260). Gaffney suggested that gender an- imus is present in all sexual assault cases and recommends that courts adopt a rebuttable pre- sumption of gender animus in rape cases. Domestic violence can also fit the hate crime model, as the violence is often a repeated and patterned attack on women. Serial and repeated attacks by a perpetrator are often characteristic of hate crimes. Gender-biased epithets are com- mon during a hate crime assault and such lan- guage is common in domestic abuse of a woman by her male partner (NiCarthy, 1986). Goldscheid (1999) noted that women who are battered are particularly vulnerable when they are pregnant, when their ""femaleness"" is most apparent. She also noted a pattern of battering violence either with one woman over a long pe- riod of time or with multiple women. A man in New Hampshire became the first man in his state to be sentenced under a hate crime law due to gender-biased violence (Jordan, 1994). His history of violence toward women along with repeated referrals to women with ""degrading, McPhail / GENDER-BIAS HATE CRIMES 135 insulting, and intimidating words"" put him in the same category of someone acting out of ra- cial or religious bigotry according to the judge. Again, epithets that target the victim's group status are often a hallmark of hate crimes. Women being attacked are often termed ""bitches,"" ""cunts,"" and ""whores,"" words that target their femaleness. Another hallmark of hate crime is the harm it does to the victim's com- munity in addition to the individual victim(s). For instance, although not all women are raped, most women fear rape (Gordon & Riger, 1989). Women al- ter their daily lives in nu- merous ways to avoid the violent behavior of men. Choundas (1995) noted, ""While potential victims of racial, ethnic, or reli- gious violence might attempt to avoid certain neighborhoods in which prejudice might run particularly rampant, women remain safe from street harassment and violent assault only by staying out of those areas known as public"" (pp. 1090-1091). And yet, even in ""private,"" women are not safe fromthe hands of intimate partners. Again, this intimate relationship often cloaks the reality of the violence. Characteristics of hate crime also include the pervasive social harmsuch acts inflict on society in general. In this case, the pervasive social harmto women includes constant threats of vio- lence and restrictions on freedomto move about the world, which may impinge on economic op- portunities. Domestic violence also inflicts harms on the institution of the family, adds costs and dangers to the workplace, has links to crim- inal and suicidal tendencies, and instills violent propensities in the next generation of males (Choundas, 1995). Another characteristic of hate crime is whether the target community perceives it as a hate crime. This was the case in the following example. In November 1994 at the University of New Mexico's Zimmerman Library, more than 100 bound volumes of gender and gay studies journals were taken, and those left defaced with swastikas and scrawled messages such as ""Where is your bitch propaganda?"" (Hood & Rollins, 1995). Although some university ad- ministrators and faculty saw the crime as a mat- ter of censorship or a prank (especially when the volumes were later found hidden in the library), feminist faculty and staff defined it as a hate crime. The next year, the Board of Regents passed a hate crime policy, which included gen- der as a category, with the library incident noted by local press as a motivating factor. Finally, several other factors, often particu- lars of the crime, make gender-bias violence fit the hate crime paradigm. Levin (Webb, 1994) be- lieved violence against women is a hate crime because it is often characterized by (a) hate lan- guage, (b) the absence of another motive (such as robbery), (c) excessive brutality including genital and breast mutilation, (d) lack of provo- cation, and (e) victims suffer long-term harm. Perpetrators of hate crime are often young men in groups (Levin & McDevitt, 1993), which is of- ten characteristic of violence against women, es- pecially gang rapes. Another criteria of hate crime is that the characteristic the victim is tar- geted for is an immutable one; that is, the person cannot change it. Therefore, the person is pow- erless to avoid being targeted, now or in the fu- ture. Although transgenderists and postmod- ernists would disagree, gender is generally viewed as an immutable trait. Transgendered individuals are often themselves targets of hate crime, and recent legislation in California in- cludes transsexuals as a protected category (Jenness & Grattet, 2001). Gender Inclusion Benefits The policy benefits of having gender as a sta- tus within hate crime policy are numerous. Per- haps the primary benefit is the one cited by Weisburd and Levin (1994), ""By recognizing the group-based animosity underlying these vic- timizations, we not only decry the violence but also take the first step in confronting the under- lying attitude that allows the violence to occur"" (p. 41). The solutions to social problems are de- termined by the definitions attributed to the problems. If the problem is identified as per- sonal and individual, as violence against 136 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE / April 2002 Another hallmark of hate crime is the harm it does to the victim's community in addition to the individual victim(s). For instance, although not all women are raped, most women fear rape. women has been considered for so long, then so- lutions will follow that individualized model. Placing gender in its proper place among hate crimes redefines the problem as public and po- litical, causing the victims to be viewed as wor- thy of legal redress instead of blame. Angelari (1994) listed other benefits includ- ing new legal remedies and increased public awareness of the seriousness and prevalence of violence against women. The new legal reme- dies include increased penalties, which provide incentives for police and prosecutors to take vi- olence against women more seriously, opportu- nities to seek civil remedies, damages in civil award suits to pay for treatment, civil suits offering emotional reward for establishing guilt of the attacker, and offering ""victims of gender bias-motivated violence confirmation that their suffering is part of a greater, and regretfully un- addressed, social problemof violence against women"" (p. 102). A rape survivor hauntingly spoke (Kalven, 1999) of this connection to the larger group of victimized women: ""I feel in touch with something so large. I felt it from the first moments. I feel connected to cavewomen, to women who've been raped through history. It's like a weight, bearing down on me"" (p. 142). The benefit of increasing public awareness of the seriousness of violence against women is that it (a) directs attention away fromrape myths and onto motives of hate, power, and control, (b) shifts attention away fromthe victim and on to the motives and actions of the perpe- trators, and (c) also moves attention away from the relationship and onto the violence. A shift in focus on motivation fromvictimto perpetrator would change the questions asked of the victim from""Why don't you leave?"" and ""What were you wearing?"" to asking the perpetrator ""Why did you target women?"" and ""What part does misogyny play in this violence?"" Also, such a shift changes treatment of the perpetrator in ways already practiced within the feminist com- munity; that is, having rapists or domestic vio- lence abusers recognize that they have more than a problemwith individual women but a problemwith how they view and treat women more generally (Gondolf & Russell, 1987). To increase the rewards of recognizing gen- der as a status category, the interaction of gen- der with other status categories must also be ac- knowledged. Not to do so unnecessary limits the understanding of hate crime as it applies to women and serves to make many women invis- ible, especially women who occupy multiple status categories. GENDER ESSENTIALISM Hate crime policy is largely focused on pro- viding increased protection and remedies for specific, targeted groups of people based pri- marily on a history of discriminatory practices and widespread prejudice expressed toward their group. This division of people into speci- fied categories can be a source of contention. For instance, Jacobs and Potter (1998) criticized such categorization as leading to identity poli- tics and the ""Balkanization of American soci- ety"" (p. 8). Harris also offered a critique of cate- gorization, however, based on a much different premise. Harris (1993) was critical of feminist legal theorists who speak of ""gender"" as though it were both universal and separate from other systems of domination. Harris de- fined ""gender essentialism"" as ""the notion that there is a monolithic 'women's experience' that can be described independent of other facets of experience like race, class, and sexual orienta- tion"" (p. 348). Throughout this article, and much of the hate crime policy domain, status categories are spo- ken of as if they were discrete and separate cate- gories. Such notions not only create divisions between categories of people, they fail to recog- nize that people occupy multiple categories. By ignoring people who fall within multiple tar- geted status categories, it is often women who are made invisible. The FBI defines a multiple- bias incident as ""any hate crime incident in which one or more of the offenses were commit- ted as a result of two or more bias motivations"" (FBI, 1999a, p. 7). However, the category is little used. In 1999, when the FBI reported 9,301 hate crime offenses, only 10 were recorded as multiple-bias incidents. Ignoring multiple status categories in theo- retical discussions as well as statistical report- ing leaves gender out of the picture. For in- stance, Jenness and Broad (1994) noted how the McPhail / GENDER-BIAS HATE CRIMES 137 gay and lesbian antiviolence projects have adopted many of the strategies of the women's movement's antiviolence projects without adopting a gendered understanding of vio- lence. Ault (1997) echoed this point by noting that gay and lesbian antiviolence projects often fail to note the connections between sexual ori- entation and gender discrimination, resulting in the assumption that lesbian women have more in common with gay men than heterosexual women. Another assumption follows: that is, that attacks on gays and lesbians are exclusively due to homophobia and not misogyny. Attacks on gay men may be due to misogyny, due to their perceived similarity with women, as well as homophobia. Hate crimes against lesbian women are often attributed solely to homophobia rather than some combination of homophobia and misog- yny. Such discrete catego- rizations ""create a false dichotomy between the categories 'lesbian' and 'woman' and 'anti-lesbian' and 'anti-woman.' Anti-lesbian is quintessentially anti-woman; vi- olence against women of all sexual orientations is often overtly 'anti-lesbian' "" (Ault, 1997, p. 59). Not including gender as a category creates problems for women who are hate crime vic- tims. Pharr (1990) questioned, When hate crimes are limited to anti-Semitic, racist, and homophobic violence, there is inherent confu- sion: when Jewish women are killed, when women of color are killed, when lesbians are raped or killed, it is often impossible to determine if they were at- tacked because of their reli- gion, race, sexual identity, or their gender. (p. 2) Police often have diffi- culty determining motive when there are multiple identities. In her study of the identification of hate crimes by police officers, Martin (1995) related the problemwith determin- ing motive in the follow- ing two cases involving women of color. In one incident, two African American women were so- liciting for a charity door to door. A White homeowner yelled at them, ""Get the fuck out, niggers!"" and then chased themdown the street while he was naked. The police determined this to be a racial incident because the man yelled ""niggers,"" but noted in their report that he prob- ably would not have done the same to two Afri- can American men. Another incident occurred when a White man in a car yelled, ""move, you Black nigger bitch mother fucker!"" which was recorded by the police as racial harassment. However, the victimis noted to have said, ""If I were a man he wouldn't have done that"" (Mar- tin, 1995, p. 321). Harris listed reasons why gender essential- ismis so attractive: (a) as a matter of intellectual convenience, it is easy; (b) essentialismrepre- sents emotional safety; (c) it provides opportu- nities for power games and hierarchies of op- pression; and (d) cognitively, it provides a way of organizing data, even at the cost of leaving some data and experiences out. Such a gender essentialist focus does have problematic conse- quences in hate crime policy. For instance, en- hanced penalties are often seen as a solution to hate crime, which may disproportionately affect men of color because they are likely to face in- creased discrimination in the criminal justice system(Angelari, 1994). African American women may be less likely to support penalty en- hancements due to their unique vantage point at the intersection of race and gender. Violence against women also may be very different for various subgroups of women. For example, race and rape intersect to make a very different expe- rience, especially for African American women because of the legacy of rape during eras of slav- ery, Reconstruction, and JimCrow (Davis, 1981). Having a checkmark for ""multiple bias"" is not enough. It is more than a bookkeeping or ac- counting problem. The result of category essentialismis that the gendered nature of much violence is once again ignored or marginalized, especially as it affects women who are targeted due to their membership in multiple targeted status categories. The interconnections among 138 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE / April 2002 Hate crimes against lesbian women are often attributed solely to homophobia rather than some combination of homophobia and misogyny. The result of category essentialism is that the gendered nature of much violence is once again ignored or marginalized, especially as it affects women who are targeted due to their membership in multiple targeted status categories. systems of oppression have been brought to the forefront by numerous women of color theo- rists, including Davis (1981) and Collins (2000). Collins used the terms ""intersectionality"" and ""matrix of domination"" to describe the intercon- nections of oppressions. Intersectionality is de- fined as the ""particular forms of intersecting oppressions, for example, intersections of race and gender, or of sexuality and nation"" (p. 18). For example, a female Muslim hate crime victim may be acknowledged, but the bias is often solely attributed to her religion rather than a combination of her gender and religion. In the hate crime literature, the intersections are ig- nored, which often leads to a marginalization of the gendered nature of violence. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH, PRACTICE, AND POLICY Gender as a status category has taken a de- tour on the road to hate crime policy acceptance but is traveling the road nonetheless. Although still not universally included in hate crime pol- icy, gender is frequently included as a status cat- egory. However, victory cannot yet be claimed. There are still struggles ahead to keep gender in the paradigm, to see that the policy is effectively implemented, and to face the new challenges that lie ahead. There is concern that the policies will be viewed as more symbolic rather than to be practically implemented. There is also con- cern about the institutionalization of these poli- cies as the law enforcement community imple- ments them. The implications for research, practice, and policy will be discussed. Research Because the hate crime domain is still in its in- fancy, research is needed in all areas of hate crime in general and gender bias in particular. Currently, much of the literature on gender-bias violence consists of conceptual arguments within legal circles and little empirical research. The research focus must include gender bias and the multiple statuses of many targeted women. One specific research suggestion in- cludes surveying law enforcement officials to determine their knowledge of, and interest in, identifying and prosecuting gender-bias hate crimes. Additional calls for research are in- cluded in two new hate crime reports (Green, McFalls, & Smith, 2001; McDevitt, Balboni, & Bennett, 2000). Practice Practice implications include developing and implementing training programs for police offi- cers, judges, and prosecutors on gender-bias crimes. Although hate crime training is avail- able, often it does not include the category of gender. Such training also would need to be evaluated to determine its effectiveness in rais- ing both awareness and knowledge of gender- bias hate crimes and whether that awareness or knowledge translates into specific actions and protections for women. Models for training could include programs often provided by women's rape crisis and domestic violence pro- grams to police cadets and officers. Theoretical models most appropriate would be radical fem- inist theory or social dominance theory (SDT). SDT posits that all human societies are struc- tured as systems of group-based hierarchies, which includes a gender systemin which males have disproportionate power over females (Sidanius & Pratto, 1999). Education for the gen- eral public would also be beneficial. Programs addressed to elementary, secondary, and higher education students could focus on preventing hate crimes through increased acceptance and tolerance while dismantling hierarchies and promoting equality. Because women's organizations were shut out of the initial policy process, they must be in- vited into the process. Because the gender com- ponent came from top-down rather than from women's activists, a first step might be for women's organizations to learn about how gen- der fits within the hate crime paradigm. Al- though this is occurring at the national level among women's organizations, it does not ap- pear to be happening at the state and local lev- els. A discussion should ensue on how to best address violence against women to ensure the best use of scarce resources. Women's organiza- tions must be informed about the potential ben- efits of categorizing violence against women as McPhail / GENDER-BIAS HATE CRIMES 139 gender-bias hate crimes. Armed with such knowledge, women's organizations can once again take the lead in both training and moni- toring the implementation of the law. Maroney (1998) suggested advocacy groups develop leadership at the regional and national levels, formlong-lasting coalitions and resist di- visiveness between status categories, and resist seeing hate crime legislation as an end unto it- self or a substitute for real systemic change. Elaborating on the last point, Maroney re- minded us, It is possible to support anti-hate crime measures without supporting the more controversial and resource-heavy demands of disenfranchised groups for equality in housing, education, wealth, and sex- ual freedoms. Doing so allows government authori- ties to condemn the most extreme manifestations of prejudice without committing to eradication of lesser, more pervasive forms. (pp. 584-585) Addressing discriminatory violence against women is merely one piece of a wider agenda to improve the status of women. Policy Another focus must be on policy. The focus on policy must include monitoring the imple- mentation of hate crime policy, including the possibility of unintended consequences. Policy concerns include continuing to add gender as a status category to state and federal policies as well as revising FBI and other guidelines to in- clude gender examples. Women's organizations can join with hate crime coalitions to work on a state-by-state basis to ensure gender is a status category in all 50 states. Maroney (1998) cau- tioned that hate crime law is now in the hands of the criminal justice system whose views of hate crime might differ from the advocacy groups that successfully proposed the laws. One con- cern is that the law may be used to against those people it was intended to protect. Angelari (1994) noted that policies meant to protect women have had unintended consequences, such as the dual arrests of both parties under mandatory arrest policies in domestic violence cases. Monitoring policy implementation is nec- essary to see that legislative intent is carried out and that no unintended consequences befall women as a class. McDevitt et al. (2000) suggested that the FBI convene a working group to discuss the inclu- sion of gender in its national report because many states are beginning to collect local statis- tics. Statistics on violence against women are notoriously underreported and subject to con- troversy. Including the number of women who are victims of gender-bias assaults in the na- tional report will pose unique difficulties. The FBI and other law enforcement guidelines must also be rewritten to include examples that in- clude gender. Such examples might include adding ""Take Back the Night Marches"" to gay and lesbian pride parades and Martin Luther King, Jr. Day celebrations. It would include add- ing gender-bias epithets or other comments in- cluding stereotypical and derogatory state- ments about women as a class or group. Such statements often include blaming women for provoking or deserving the attack and blaming women for the perpetrator's present position or difficulties either during the commission or af- ter the commission of the crime. Again, the mul- tiple statuses of women must be taken into ac- count in developing the FBI guidelines. That is, investigators must ask if the crime was moti- vated in part by the victim's race, religion, or sexual orientation, but also in conjunction with the victim's gender. Maroney (1998) warned of the potential dan- ger when hate crime becomes institutionalized. Anti-hate crime efforts, once adopted, have come firmly within the control of the legislators, govern- ment authorities, police, prosecutors, and judges that shape and implement them. That institutional control, coupled with inadequate movement activity outside of those institutions, has frustrated larger at- tempts to alter systemic mistreatment of hate crime. (p. 598) Maroney detailed many present and potential problems, such as the bias of police officers, prosecutors, and judges who have much discre- tion; law enforcement's tendency to only ad- dress ""extraordinary cases""; the possibility of selective enforcement with target communities having the laws turned against them; and the irony of having the police, who are guilty of 140 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE / April 2002 many hate crimes themselves, responsible for apprehending other bias offenders. This latter situation is directly applicable to violence against women as police officers have fre- quently been charged with domestic violence, rape, sexual harassment, and other misogynist assaults either against women in their personal lives or women they encounter in the course of their work. Gelber (2000) raised different concerns about hate crime policies: ""While the logic of hate crime categorisation seems readily extendable to incorporate certain crimes against women, the hate crime argument begins to raise ques- tions which challenge assumptions about the usefulness of hate crime legislation."" She is con- cerned about how the laws might be applied in- appropriately or inconsistently, also sharing concerns that penalty-enhancement laws might disproportionately punish already marginal- ized populations. Gelber suggested a shift in fo- cus to monitoring hate crimes, community edu- cation to raise awareness, and greater provision of services to victims. CONCLUSION Clearly, the case for gender fitting a hate crime paradigm can be made. However, there is much room to debate when and how it should be incorporated into the violence against women movement. There is a danger that in incorporat- ing women into the hate crime paradigm, the model is stretched so thin that it collapses. The gender bias hate crime model is in its infancy; much work needs to be done to assess its effec- tiveness in its adolescence. Violence against women is a serious problem. Only time and con- tinued analyses will tell if the hate crime para- digmoffers effective solutions and strategies for violence against women rather than a symbolic gesture with few real protections. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE, POLICY, AND RESEARCH Much more research is needed to fully understand all aspects of hate crimes, especially as it concerns vi- olence against women. Such research could include surveys of police and prosecutors to determine their level of knowledge of, and commitment to, prosecut- ing gender-bias crimes. Because the hate crime laws on the books are so new, it is imperative to monitor and evaluate the effects of the policy to determine if the policy is being used and how or whether the policy will remain a sym- bolic gesture, especially with regard to women. Training materials must be developed for law en- forcement personnel, including police officers, pros- ecutors, and judges, that specifically address gender-bias hate crimes. The effectiveness of such training must be evaluated. Because most state and local women's organizations were not on the forefront of the movement to add gender as a status category to hate crime policy, women's advocacy groups must be educated about the possibilities of gender-bias hate crime policy and become involved in the monitoring of policy imple- mentation as well as the training of law enforcement officials. Better data collection must be mandated to enable researchers and advocates to track the number of hate crimes reported, the number of hate crimes charged, and the subsequent number of prosecu- tions, both successful and unsuccessful, including the category of gender. The FBI must begin to in- clude gender-bias hate crimes and gender examples in the guidelines in its data collection efforts. Advocacy at both the state and federal level is neces- sary to ensure that gender as a status category con- tinues to be proposed and adopted in subsequent hate crime legislation. Fewer than half of the states currently include gender as a status category. A greater understanding of multiple status catego- ries is necessary to determine the interaction be- tween gender and other status categories such as race, religion, and sexual orientation. Training of law enforcement personnel must include this vital topic. Training in gender-bias crimes must also include public awareness and education. Common percep- tions of violence against women lead members of the public to ask, ""What was she wearing when she was raped?"" in instances of sexual assault and, ""Why doesn't she just leave?"" in instances of domes- tic violence. Through the lens of the hate crime para- digm, more appropriate questions would look at the motivations of the perpetrator rather than the vic- tim, asking, ""Did he select a victim based on gen- McPhail / GENDER-BIAS HATE CRIMES 141 Clearly, the case for gender fitting a hate crime paradigm can be made. However, there is much room to debate when and how it should be incorporated into the violence against women movement. der?"" and ""Does he have a pattern of assaults upon women?"" Treatment programs for offenders and victim ser- vices must include the radical feminist theoretical model in their work to acknowledge the root cause of much violence against women, in which women are often targeted due to their gender and men are often perpetrators due to their enforcement of gen- der hierarchies. This model best fits within the hate crime paradigm and addresses the political nature of violence against women. REFERENCES Angelari, M. (1994).

He is accused of intimidation, making threats, hate crimes, and disorderly conduct. He is found guilty and his punishment includes exclusion from the community, suspension of his academic privileges, a ban on taking leadership roles in campus organizations, mandatory meetings with appropriate officials to learn about correct ways of thinking and speaking, and the presentation of a formal written apology, to be submitted in draft form ""for approval.""
Readers would be excused for assuming that this occurred in some backward, repressive dictatorship or totalitarian regime, but these troubling events took place at an American University.
Austin Tong, a senior at Fordham University in New York State, posted two messages on his Instagram account.

His second post, a day later, was a photo of himself holding his lawfully owned AR-15 rifle at his off-campus home. This was captioned, ""Don't tread on me,"" followed by the emojis of the American and Communist Chinese flags and a hashtag ""commonly used by Chinese citizens to avoid censorship of online discussion of the Tiananmen Square massacre.""
Mr. Tong is a Chinese-American who arrived in the United States as a six-year-old immigrant. He explained that his second post was made to commemorate the 31st anniversary of the suppressed 1989 Chinese Democracy Movement.
According to Mr. Tong, the university ""sent safety officers at midnight to interrogate me all over a simple picture of a lawfully owned gun."" Keith Eldredge, Fordham University's Dean of Students and Assistant Vice President, followed up by advising that he was initiating an investigation for bias/hate crimes, threats/intimidation, and disorderly conduct, based on these ""posts on social media related to the current racial issues in the country and political issues in China, including one in which you were holding an automatic weapon.""
Fordham University a private educational institution that is not bound by the First Amendment nonetheless professes its commitment to free speech and expressive rights. For example, its mission statement ""guarantees the freedom of inquiry required by rigorous thinking and the quest for truth.""
The university's Demonstration Policy opens with the following: ""By its very nature, the University is a place where ideas and opinions are formulated and exchanged. Each member of the University has a right to freely express their positions and to work for their acceptance whether they assent to or dissent from existing situations in the University or society."" Similarly, Fordham's policy on ""Bias-Related Incidents and/or Hate Crimes"" claims the University:
values freedom of expression and the open exchange of ideas. The expression of controversial ideas and differing views is a vital part of University discourse. Although the expression of an idea or point of view may be offensive or inflammatory to others, it may not constitute a hate crime or bias-related incident. While this value of openness protects the expression of controversial ideas, it does not protect or condone harassment or expressions of bias or hate aimed at individuals or groups that violate the Student Code of Conduct.
Regardless of these high-minded affirmations, the University concluded that Mr. Tong's posts devoid of threats, violence, intimidation, coercion, or harassment violated the university rules on ""Bias and/or Hate Crimes"" and ""Threats/Intimidation.""
A July 14 letter from Keith Eldredge (copied to the ""Department of Public Safety"") outlined the sanctions. Mr. Tong would be barred from the campus for the duration of his degree program. He was banned from representing the university or running for any student office or position. He would be required to attend instruction and complete activities on ""implicit bias,"" including a meeting with staff of the ""multicultural affairs"" office. He would have to submit a mandatory ""apology letter,"" to be approved by the university and a failure to comply would result in the university suspending or expelling him.
Perversely, the social media backlash to these innocuous posts has itself resulted in threats, intimidation, and potential bias/hate crimes against Austin Tong. It will be interesting to see whether Fordham University will enforce the same rules and policies against the activists from the university that ""flooded the comments section"" of his posts.
In the same way that the ""quest for truth"" supported characterizing his firearm indiscriminately as an ""automatic weapon,"" the university's commitments to ""freedom of expression and the open exchange of ideas"" protected Austin Tong, who was ""forcibly silenced, faced verbal and assaulting harassment from mobs, and subjected to Soviet-style interrogation and punishment."" Despite this, and the possibility that his academic career will be marred indefinitely due to these disciplinary actions, he has been steadfast in his defense of his constitutional rights.
In a video for the NRA, Austin Tong describes his decision to purchase a gun, adding that ""[h]ere in America, we have our right to keep and bear arms. This is what keeps America free.""
Actually, Austin, it is patriots like you who fight to protect our constitutional freedoms that keep America free.",Bias Incident
32,/content/Bias_Incident_Lexis_1.DOCX,Targeted News Service,2020-07-24,1136 words,,Targeted News Service,,Rep. Rose Joins Bipartisan Call for Department of Justice Action on Anti-Asian Hate Crimes and Discrimination,False,"Rep. Max Rose, D-New York, issued the following news release:
Congressman Max Rose, who has strongly condemned discrimination against the Asian American community throughout the coronavirus pandemic, joined a bipartisan group of 150 Members of Congress in calling for the Attorney General to take action and publicly condemn discrimination and violence toward Asian Americans.
""The hate, violence, harassment and discrimination that has been hurled upon those in the Asian American community is gut-wrenching, horrible and wrong,"" Rose said. ""I hear from families and seniors that they're afraid to leave their homes, business owners forced to shut down, and far too many who have been victim to street attacks, verbal assaults, or racist fliers. It has no place in our community and we all must stand strong in solidarity against it. I'm proud to see so many of my colleagues join together from both parties to strongly condemn these actions, now the Administration must join the chorus.""
Since the beginning of the crisis, there have been numerous reports of Asian Americans being threatened, harassed, or assaulted. As of June 3, the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council reported 2,066 incidents of coronavirus-related discrimination. As a result, these communities, in addition to working to combat the coronavirus, are left fighting an additional front--that of hate and injustice.
""We write to draw particular attention to an increase in verbal and physical attacks as well as discrimination towards Asian Americans who have been wrongly blamed for the virus' spread,"" wrote Rose and the bipartisan Members of Congress in a letter to Attorney General William Barr. ""We respectfully request that you publicly condemn acts of anti-Asian bias, and provide us with regular status updates regarding the steps the Department of Justice is taking and will take going forward to combat this behavior.""
Rose is a co-sponsor of the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which was introduced by fellow New York City Congressmember Grace Meng. The legislation seeks to provide greater federal government oversight of COVID-19 hate crimes, and require the Department of Justice to provide Congress with regular updates on the status of reported bias incidents.
Last month, Rose and local elected officials from South Brooklyn hosted a roundtable with Chinese-American business owners and community leaders to discuss efforts to support small businesses and the community through the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including against rising xenophobia and discrimination.

July 20, 2020
To: The Honorable William P. Barr, Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice, 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20530
Dear Attorney General Barr:
Thank you for featuring the quote ""Coronavirus is no excuse for hate"" on the Department of Justice's hate crimes website. The COVID-19 pandemic affects all Americans and has wrought enormous pain in the United States./1
Some Americans are facing increased discrimination as a result of the pandemic. We write to draw particular attention to an increase in verbal and physical attacks as well as discrimination towards Asian Americans who have been wrongly blamed for the virus' spread. We respectfully request that you publicly condemn acts of anti-Asian bias, and provide us with regular status updates regarding the steps the Department of Justice is taking and will take going forward to combat this behavior.
Asian Americans are not responsible for the spread of coronavirus in the United States; yet, since the start of the pandemic they have experienced continued harassment, violence, and discrimination. As of June 3, the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council reported 2,066 incidents of coronavirus-related discrimination./2
These and numerous news reports have documented cases ranging from the denial of services at stores to verbal harassment on the subway to physical assaults.
In one particularly egregious instance, an individual in Texas stabbed three Asian Americans, two of whom were children, because he thought they were infecting others with COVID-19. In March, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Houston field office acknowledged the likelihood of a surge in hate crime incidents against Asian Americans./3
And most recently, a new Ipsos survey conducted for the Center for Public Integrity found that more than 30 percent of Americans have witnessed someone blaming Asian people for the coronavirus pandemic./4
We appreciate the op-ed the Department placed in the Washington Examiner generally stating that hate crimes will be investigated and prosecuted./5
However, the dangers faced by the Asian American community today are very real and deserve a strong and specific response by our government. In fact, on May 8, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights acknowledged its concerns ""over the increase in xenophobic animosity toward Asian Americans (and perceived Asian Americans) as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic"" and unanimously issued recommendations urging federal agencies reduce this sentiment./6
We note that in the early 2000s during the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak, the Bush Administration immediately took steps to prevent discrimination against Asian Americans by creating a community outreach team to monitor and document acts of anti-Asian bias and engage with the community.
Two years earlier following the September 11 terrorist attacks, the Administration had similarly sought to prevent attacks against Arab, Muslim, Sikh, and South Asian American communities by engaging with community leaders, conducting coordinated civil rights enforcement, and speaking out forcefully./7
While these prior responses were not perfect, they represented an important effort to acknowledge and address the specific discrimination.
Despite the fear present within the community, each and every day Asian Americans help to combat COVID-19. While Asian Americans comprise 7 percent of the U.S. population, 17.1 percent of active medical physicians are Asian American./8
Similarly, Asian Americans are serving our country by working as nurses, health aides, and in many other essential occupations. Asian Americans are just as American as any other group of people in our country.
We respectfully request that you, as head of the Department of Justice, forcefully condemn anti-Asian bias to send an unambiguous message to all Americans that discrimination against this community is un-American and will not be tolerated. Further, we would ask that you update us regularly as to what steps the Department has taken to address our concerns. Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

The NYC Commission on Human Rights and Amanda Phingbodhipakkiya, one of the commission's two 2020-2021 Public Artists in Residence (PAIR), launched the campaign in part to combat the uptick in bias incidents related to the COVID-19 pandemic.'The insidious nature of white supremacy is that it pits communities of color against each other,' Phingbodhipakkiya said at Atlantic Terminal on Friday, surrounded by her larger-than-life-sized artworks on the station walls. 
'This [campaign] is saying we can stand for each other. I want people to look at these faces and feel us reclaiming space.'Nicole JavorksyFrom the start of the city's coronavirus crisis in February 2020, the city's Commission on Human Rights received more than 566 reports of discrimination, harassment, and bias related to COVID-19, 184 of which were anti-Asian in nature. Last year, by contrast, the Commission received just 26 reports of anti-Asian discrimination over the same time period.'Asians are the fastest growing ethnic group in America, and yet, we are told to 'go back,' and that we don't belong,' said Rocky Chin, Commissioner for the NYC Commission on Human Rights, in a press release. 'Amanda's artworks show the world that this is our home, and displays Asian New Yorkers proudly defying harmful stereotypes.'The installation, which began on Nov. 3 and will remain on display through Dec. 2, includes 45 of Phingbodhipakkiya's works, which feature vibrant colors, symbolic images, and faces which the artist describes as 'defiant, hopeful, and strong.' She noted that the flowers that surround the figures each have a deeper symbolism in Chinese culture: 'Chrysanthemum signifies resilience, Peony signifies friendship and solidarity, and Hawthorn berry signifies longevity and protection.'Nicole JavorskyPhingbodhipakkiya said that growing up in Georgia, she'd experienced many moments of anti-Asian bias, including at school. She moved to New York for college in 2006, and described the move as her 'seeking refuge in a diverse place that welcomed people from all walks of life.' The art campaign is Phingbodhipakkiya's way of expressing hope and encouraging everyone to stand up for each other. As the text on one of her artworks reads in peach-colored capitalized letters, 'WE CAN DO MORE.'Phingbodhipakkiya says she also hopes that seeing the works in the art campaign will invite folks to speak up more and talk about experiences with discrimination, bias, or harrassment.'It's common in the Asian American community to bury the hurt deep inside. That's typical also of the immigrant experience in America,' she adds. 'Talking about these hurtful and harmful experiences is just as an important part as talking about the resilience of communities. And, sometimes resilience comes from sparking joy.'The campaign will also be featured at the city's LinkNYC kiosks and bus shelters, starting in December, as well as a future installation in partnership with the NYC Department of Transportation's Art Program. There are also plans for a community mural, potentially sometime in the spring.Nicole JavorskyNicole Javorsky is a Report for America corps member.

Brooklyn Electeds Host Roundtable with Chinese-American Business and Community Leaders; Congressman announces support for COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act to combat the rise in discrimination and violence amid coronavirus pandemic; Rep. Max Rose (D-NY) News Release",False,"Congressman Max Rose, along with State Senator Andrew Gounardes, Council Member Justin Brannan, and the Office of Assembly Member Peter Abbate, Jr., today hosted a virtual roundtable with Chinese-American community and business leaders to discuss efforts to support small businesses and the community through the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including against rising xenophobia and discrimination.
""What has been happening in the past few months in terms of skyrocketing hate crimes and xenophobia against the Chinese- and Asian-American community as a result of COVID is not only disgusting, it's reprehensible and must utilize every tool at the federal, state, and city level to crack down on it,"" Rose said. ""As we talk about the economy, there's no secret that restaurants owned by Asian-Americans were some of the first to shut down. They need our help and I'm continuing to fight to ensure they have the relief and help they need and deserve.""
During the roundtable, Rose announced his support and co-sponsorship of the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which was introduced by fellow New York City Congressmember Grace Meng. The legislation seeks to provide greater federal government oversight of COVID-19 hate crimes, and require the Department of Justice (DOJ) to provide Congress with regular updates on the status of reported bias incidents.
Since the beginning of the crisis, there have been numerous reports of Asian-Americans being threatened, harassed, or assaulted. The pandemic has also fueled a rise in anti-Semitic incidents against the Jewish community, and has had adverse impacts on the LGBTQ community. As a result, these communities, in addition to working to combat the coronavirus, are left fighting an additional front--that of hate and injustice.
Rose has continued to fight for and prioritize the needs of small businesses. Earlier this month, the bipartisan Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act, which Rose co-sponsored, was signed into law and included many critical fixes for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). Following Congress passing additional funding for relief programs to help businesses and nonprofits, Rose called on four of the leading banks to prioritize the truly small businesses that are hurting most over larger corporations and businesses. Rose also testified before the House Committee on Small Business urging more safeguards to ensure federal funding goes to small and minority-owned businesses and nonprofits that need them most.

36,/content/Bias_Incident_Lexis_1.DOCX,States News Service,2020-08-05,1116 words,,States News Service,,AG GREWAL LEADS LETTER CALLING ON FACEBOOK TO TAKE STRONGER STEPS TO PREVENT USE OF ITS PLATFORMS TO SPREAD HATE AND DISINFORMATION,False,"The following information was released by the office of the Attorney General of New Jersey:
Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal today led a group of 20 Attorneys General from across the nation in calling on Facebook to take additional steps to prevent the popular social media website from being used to spread hate and disinformation. The group also urged Facebook to provide stronger support for users who fall victim to online intimidation and harassment on its platforms.
Co-led by District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine and Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, the letter to Facebook Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg asserted today that, despite its stated commitment to working to keep its user community safe, Facebook has fallen short in keeping hate content off its platforms and protecting users from online harassment.
Todays letter observes that the nation is presently in a moment of reckoning on issues of racial justice and civil rights. Against this backdrop, the letter states that [p]rivate parties, organized groups and public officials continue to use Facebook to spread misinformation and project messages of hate against different groups of Americans, with many of those messages leading to the abuse of individual Facebook users.
The letter follows the release of a Civil Rights Audit of Facebooks practices commissioned by the company and completed in Julythat faults Facebook for failing to advance civil rights, and refusing to enforce its own policies against dangerous organizations and individuals, including white supremacists and other extremists.
Recent surveys suggest more than 40 percent of Americans have experienced some form of online harassment, and that of those victims, more than 75 percent have reported being harassed on Facebook.
The hate-filled messaging and disinformation were highlighting in this letter is typically aimed at individuals because of what they look like, where they come from, what gender identity they claim, and what they believe, said Attorney General Grewal. It is divisive and dehumanizing, and we are committed to combating it at every turn. Facebooks own audit revealed significant shortcomings in its approach to keeping this kind of content off its platforms, promoting civil rights and discouraging discrimination. The company has espoused a desire to do better, so today were calling on them to walk the walk. Facebook has ample resources to do far more than it has been doing.
Hate sells on Facebook, said Division of Civil Rights (DCR) Director Rachel Wainer Apter, and all too often the site is used to spread extremism and facilitate discrimination. She continued: As the Covid-19 pandemic has exposed and exacerbated systemic injustice, and as millions of Americans have joined together to protest racism and other forms of bias, it is long past due for Facebook to ensure that its platform promotes human dignity and civil rights, rather than division, dehumanization, and fear.
Todays letter follows other actions by New Jersey officials to encourage Facebook to enforce policies to combat hate on its platform. In April 2019, DCR wrote to Facebook urging that it more closely monitor the Rise Up Ocean County (RUOC) Facebook page, which had been found to contain anti-Semitic content and other hate-filled posts.
Facebook ultimately removed the RUOC page, but not until February 2020, after further calls to action by Governor Murphy and Attorney General Grewal.
Todays letter urges Facebook to implement several reforms recommended in the Civil Rights Audit to strengthen its commitment to civil rights and fighting disinformation and discrimination. It further recommends steps designed to improve Facebooks supportive services for victims.
According to the letter, much of the harassment reported by Facebook users focuses on characteristics protected by civil rights laws, including race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender and gender identity, and disability.
Such harassment can include conduct like cyberstalking, doxing (maliciously publishing someones personal information), and swatting (filing false police reports to prompt law enforcement response targeting the victim.) The letter contends that at present, recourse is unavailable for too many of these victims, due to limitations on the services that Facebook offers victims, as well as other factors.
The Attorneys General acknowledge that Facebook hason occasiontaken action to address violations of its terms of service in cases where we have helped elevate our constituents concerns. But the letter adds that many Facebook users continue to find the redress process slow, frustrating, and ineffective.
The reforms recommended in todays letter, many of which are highlighted in the recent Civil Rights Audit, include calls for Facebook to:
Aggressively enforce its policies against hate speech and organized hate organizations;
Allow public, third-party audits of hate content and enforcement;
Commit to an ongoing, independent analysis of Facebooks content population scheme and the prompt development of best practices guidance; and
Expand policies limiting inflammatory advertisements that vilify minority groups.
The Attorneys General also recommend steps to enhance Facebook supportive services including:
Offer live real-time assistance to victims of intimidation and harassment;
Make information about unlawful harassment and intimidation more readily available; and
Strengthen filtering, reporting, and blocking tools.
Todays letter is one part of Attorney General Grewal and Governor Phil Murphys broader efforts to combat bias in New Jersey. In 2019, Lieutenant Governor Sheila Oliver signed an Executive Order convening a Task Force on Youth Bias (Task Force), headed by DCR Director Wainer Apter, after the 2018 Bias Incident Report compiled by the New Jersey State Police and the Division on Civil Rights showed a rising tide of hate in New Jersey. The Report noted there were 569 reported bias incidents in New Jersey in 2018 a number higher than in any year since 2011, and that there had been a stark increase in young people involved in bias offenses.
The Task Forces mission is to provide advice and recommendations to the Governor and the Attorney General, and to other state agencies, on strategies and actions to reduce incidents of hate and bias involving students and young adults. In addition to New Jersey, the District of Columbia and Illinois, the following states Attorneys General have signed todays letter: New York, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, Vermont and Wisconsin.
###",Bias Incident
37,/content/Bias_Incident_Lexis_1.DOCX,"Spokesman Review (Spokane, WA)",2020-11-21,1214 words,A; Pg. 008,Lewis Kamb Seattle Times,,"Washington's increasing hate crime numbers in latest report tell only part of the story, experts say",False,"SEATTLE - It seems counterintuitive, but some law enforcement experts in Washington can see progress in the escalating numbers of reported hate crimes statewide, in the wake of the FBI's latest annual report released this week showing that the criminal offenses motivated by bias have reached record levels nationwide.
Washington's reported number of hate crimes rose from 506 reported in 2018 to 542 last year - the latest uptick in what's been a rising trend documented in recent years in the FBI's Uniform Crime Report, the agency's annual compilation of crime statistics reported by local law enforcement departments nationwide.
With its 7% increase, Washington - which typically rates among the states with the most reported bias crimes - climbed one rung higher into third place in the national rankings for the undesirable category, trailing only California, with 1,015 reported offenses, and New York, with 611.
Washington has such a high ranking in part because people here are comparatively more likely to report the hate crimes that happen to them, experts said - and while higher rates of reporting are a good thing, they also highlight the sheer volume of hate crimes that are committed in Washington and nationwide.
""I think Washington state does a remarkably good job of reporting these incidents because we have an active citizenry that pays more attention to them,"" said Monisha Harrell, chair of Equal Rights Washington, a statewide advocacy group for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer residents.
""But where Washington is absolutely no exception is the crimes we're seeing here,"" Harrell added. ""Our top (bias) crimes are against Black people, then it's religion and LGBTQ. That matches trends across the nation and tells me that clearly, like everywhere else, we've got work to do.""
The rising number of reports reflected in the FBI's stats underscore what anti-bias advocates say they're routinely experiencing these days.
""We get reports almost daily from the public about incidents of violence or hate,"" said Kendall Kosai, interim regional director of the Anti-Defamation League, Pacific Northwest. ""We are pretty much busier than we've ever been before.""
While useful in some ways, the FBI's bias crime data varies wildly from state to state, largely depending on different levels of participation and assorted reporting methods by local police agencies. In turn, the annual report provides an apples-to-oranges comparison, at best.
""We have to take those (statistics) with a grain of salt,"" said FBI Supervisory Special Agent Ryan Bruett, statewide program coordinator for Hate Crimes and Civil Rights in Washington. ""It's difficult to draw too many conclusions from the data.""
Case in point: Fourteen states reported 20 or fewer hate crimes for all of last year, with Mississippi reporting just five offenses and Alabama failing to record a single one. The number of local police agencies submitting hate crime reports to the FBI last year also ranged from none in Alabama to 208 in New Jersey, illustrating the spottiness in local participation that the FBI relies upon to compile the statistics.
So, in that sense, the number of reported hate crimes in Washington ""can be seen as a positive,"" Bruett said, because ""it shows that, here in Washington, there's more reporting of these kinds of incidents.""
""And that's a good thing,"" he added. ""Much like sexual assault cases, one of our long-running concerns is that hate crimes are under-reported.""
Even in Washington, underreporting of hate crimes remains a problem, said Kosai, the regional ADL director. Several major cities, including Kirkland, Lakewood, Edmonds and Pasco failed to report a single hate crime to the FBI, he noted.
Another factor that can skew the FBI stats is the variety, or total lacking, of state laws defining what constitutes a hate crime. While a set of federal acts that generally outlaw threatening or injuring someone else based on race, color, religion, sexual orientation and other grounds could apply to crimes committed in any state, just 32 states had their own bias crime statutes as recently as five years ago. Today, all but three states have hate crime laws, though they vary significantly from one state to another.
Washington's malicious harassment law specifies eight categories for bias, including race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, gender, sexual orientation and mental, physical or sensory disability. Seattle also has its own hate crime law that includes five additional categories: homelessness, marital status, political ideology, age and parental status.
Beyond using the annual FBI numbers to compare Washington to other states or to its past, experts say the rising numbers here generally tell a story of progress in outreach work. The typical targets of hate crimes - racial, ethnic and religious minorities, immigrants and LGBTQ people - are communities traditionally reluctant to report crimes to police, they said.
""We really want and need people to come forward to report these kinds of crimes,"" said Seattle Police Det. Elizabeth Wareing, the only full-time bias crimes coordinator assigned to a police agency in Washington. ""So if we're building trust with the people who are being victimized, we're going to see higher numbers. We're just going to have to accept that, and Seattle is a perfect example.""
Most of Washington's reported hate crime comes through the Seattle Police Department. Unlike most local police agencies in this state or nationwide, Seattle not only tracks offenses motivated by bias but also records crimes that are committed for other reasons but also include an element of bias, as well as ""noncriminal bias incidents.""
The latter two categories might include a robbery suspect who commits a crime for financial motivations but shouts a racial slur at a security guard who chases him down; and a passing motorist who yells ""go back to your country"" to a pedestrian wearing a hijab.
While neither incident would show up as a hate crime in the FBI's annual report, documenting them helps demonstrate to targeted communities that police take these matters seriously, which in turn builds trust and increases overall reporting, Wareing said.
""Most agencies see the very tip of the iceberg on these incidents,"" she said. ""We see a little bit more than that.""
Seattle's reporting approach, updated and posted regularly on the department's website, also provides a more nuanced perspective than the FBI statistics, Wareing said. In 2020 - just as it has every year since 2015, the year Wareing took on the bias crime coordinator's role - reported hate crimes have increased. But perhaps more telling is a spike in general reports of incivility and use of inflammatory language, Wareing said.
""These aren't necessarily even someone committing a crime, just saying something that's hurtful,"" she said. ""People are reporting it more and more and our officers are doing a good job of capturing it. And that's important for people to feel heard.""
While people sometimes equate the term ""hate crime"" with overt acts of terrorism by white supremacist groups or other extremists, the reports that local agencies are fielding and passing along to the FBI typically are committed by someone who lives or works near you, Wareing and Bruett said.",Bias Incident

With federal efforts lacking, Asian Americans are starting social media campaigns to combat the rise in racism they have faced during the coronavirus pandemic.
In a video released Tuesday on several social media platforms, a group of Asian people in face masks detailed the discrimination, harassment and racism they have experienced during the pandemic — such as being told to ""go back to China"" or having people cough at them or spit in their direction.
Pulling off their masks, they reveal their occupations as firefighter, nurse, doctor, deliverywoman, bus driver and other roles considered essential during the pandemic. The minute-long video ends with each of them calling to Fight the Virus. Fight the Bias — the title of the video.
Produced by the Advertising Council, a nonprofit organization that makes public service announcements, and Emmy Award-winning writer Alan Yang, the video is aimed at building a sense of humanity and breaking the silence around the hatred impacting the Asian American community.
""Amid this pandemic and the stresses associated, nobody should have to also endure the added layer of fear that comes from this surge in racial violence and harassment,"" said Advertising Council President and CEO Lisa Sherman in a press release. She said the video is expected to inspire Americans to rethink their biases and help end the wave of racism facing Asian Americans.
Reports by many civil rights organizations show that Asian communities across the US have endured increasing harassment and assaults since the spread of the novel coronavirus in the country.
The Anti-Defamation League has recently compiled a long list of coronavirus-related anti-Asian incidents from January to June, including people being physically assaulted, properties vandalized, and an online meeting disrupted by anti-Asian slurs in the chat function.
Stop AAPI Hate, a coronavirus-related racism-reporting platform, recorded more than 2,000 incidents across the country in three months.
Statements by President Donald Trump and his allies referring to COVID-19 as the ""Chinese virus"" or the ""kung flu"" have fueled xenophobia and bigotry toward people of Chinese descent and other Asian Americans, said Russell Jeung, chair and professor of Asian American Studies at San Francisco State University.
""President Trump's insistent use of the term 'Chinese virus' creates an implicit association that the virus is Chinese, and that Chinese people have the virus,"" Jeung told China Daily.
Subsequently, others have blamed Chinese and Asians in the US for being the source of the disease and for bringing it to the US, said Jeung, who compiled the Stop AAPI Hate data. He noted that when Trump began using the terms, bias incidents against Asian Americans jumped.
""It's clear that President Trump is scapegoating China for the pandemic. He does so to deflect responsibility for his poor handling of this public health crisis and more recently to avoid dealing with Black Lives Matter and America's racial injustices,"" said Jeung. ""By blaming China, he seeks to create an outside enemy that his political base could be angry with.""
A new survey by the Pew Research Center shows that 4 in 10 US adults say it has become more common for people to express racist views toward Asians since the pandemic began.
About a quarter of the Asian American respondents say they feared someone might threaten or physically attack them, a higher percentage than for any other group.
The Trump administration has been criticized for doing little about the rise in anti-Asian hate amid the pandemic, in comparison to actions taken in similar situations such as the SARS outbreak and the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
For instance, after the 9/11 attacks, former President George W. Bush, a Republican, and the attorney general and FBI director immediately issued statements that hate crimes and discrimination against Arab, Muslim, Sikh and South Asian Americans would not be tolerated, and the Justice Department officials had attended more than 100 meetings and events with leaders from those communities, according to the Center for Public Integrity.
""When the coronavirus pandemic hit the US, President Trump failed to protect the Asian Americans. He uses China as the scapegoat and incites racial hysteria by using slurs such as 'Chinese virus' and 'kung flu,'"" said Julie Tang, retired judge of San Francisco Superior Court and a civil rights activist. ""The Chinese Americans felt the sting of the demonizing of China in the press and by the administration.""
Tang has joined the grassroots efforts to raise the awareness of pandemic-related harassment by launching a campaign using a Facebook profile picture filter. The campaign calls on people to wear a virtual mask on their Facebook page that says, ""Fight the Virus, not Asians"".
Americans should also be aware that the Chinese community has been a role model in fighting the pandemic, said California state Senator Scott Wiener, who represents San Francisco, during an online news conference Tuesday.
""The Chinese community is setting a very strong example of everyone wearing masks and wearing them correctly ... being responsible and being safe and being respectful towards the community,"" said Wiener.
""Chinatown is the densest neighborhood west of the Mississippi, and it's had very few infections,"" he said. ""That's not just random. That's because the Chinese community has stepped up and shown leadership and modeled good behavior for the rest of the community, and I'm very grateful for that,"" he said.",Bias Incident

FENVES, In His Official Capacity as President of the University of Texas at Austin, Defendant - Appellee Appeal from the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas Before KING, JONES, and COSTA, Circuit Judges.1 EDITH H. JONES, Circuit Judge: On behalf of a group of students, Speech First, Inc., appeals the dismissal of its First and Fourteenth Amendment challenges to several policies that intend to regulate speech at the University of Texas at Austin. After Speech First sought a preliminary injunction against enforcement of these policies, and the University responded, the district court dismissed the case on the basis that Speech First lacked standing. This conclusion was mistaken. The chilling effect of allegedly vague regulations, coupled with a range of potential 1 Judge Costa concurs in the judgment. United States Court of Appeals Fifth Circuit FILED October 28, 2020 Lyle W. Cayce Clerk Case: 19-50529 Document: 00515631238 Page: 1 Date Filed: 11/09/2020 No. 19-50529 2 penalties for violating the regulations, was, as other courts have held,2 sufficient “injury” to ensure that Speech First “has a ‘personal stake in the outcome of the controversy.’” Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S 149, 158, 134 S. Ct. 2334, 2341 (2014) (quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S 490, 498, 95 S. Ct. 2197, 2205 (1975)). BACKGROUND Speech First, Inc., (“Speech First”) is an organization of free-speech advocates that includes students at the University of Texas at Austin (“the University”). Speech First sued the Defendant-Appellee, Gregory L. Fenves, in his official capacity as president of the University, in December 2018. At that time, the University had promulgated four policies governing students’ speech: (1) the 2018-2019 General Information Catalog, Appendix C, Institutional Rules on Students Services and Activities; (2) the Acceptable Use Policy for University Students (last revised in 2015); (3) the 2018-2019 Residence Hall Manual; and (4) the Handbook of Operating Procedures (revised no later than March 2017). Here are the pertinent portions of the regulations. 1. The Institutional Rules Fenves describes the Institutional Rules as “bedrock standards to which all University community members must adhere. ” The Rules’ Chapter 13 is titled “Speech, Expression, and Assembly,” and begins generally, declaring the “freedoms of speech, expression, and assembly” to be “fundamental rights of all persons. ” Section 13-101. This section pronounces students’ (and others’) freedom to “express their views . . . on any topic . . . subject only to rules 2 See, e.g , Dambrot v. Central Mich. Univ., 55 F.3d 1177, 1182 (6th Cir. 1995) (affirming that campus discriminatory harassment speech policy is, on its face, unconstitutionally overbroad and vague, after district court found that students had standing to sue despite lack of enforcement against them). Case: 19-50529 Document: 00515631238 Page: 2 Date Filed: 11/09/2020 No. 19-50529 3 necessary to preserve the equal rights of others and the other functions of the University. ” The section disclaims viewpoint discrimination “[e]xcept as expressly authorized by subchapter 13-200 [titled, “Prohibited Expression”]. In the next subchapter, “Prohibited Expression” includes paragraphs covering obscenity, defamation, and incitement to imminent violations of law. By far the longest prohibition covers “Harassment,” which is the “mak[ing], distribut[ing], or display[ing] on the campus any statement that constitutes verbal harassment of another. ” “Verbal harassment” is defined as “hostile or offensive speech, oral, written, or symbolic,” that: A. is not necessary to the expression of any idea described in the following subsection [“an argument for or against the substance of any political, religious, philosophical, ideological, or academic idea is not verbal harassment even if some listeners are offended by the argument or idea”]; B. is sufficiently severe, pervasive, or persistent to create an objectively hostile environment that interferes with or diminishes the victim’s ability to participate in or benefit from the services, activities, or privileges provided by the University; and C. personally describes or is personally directed to one or more specific individuals. The Rules elaborate that “[v]erbal harassment may consist of threats, insults, epithets, ridicule, [and] personal attacks,” and “is often based on the victim’s appearance, personal characteristics, or group membership, including but not limited to race, color, religion, national origin, gender, age, disability, citizenship, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression, ideology, political views, or political affiliation. ” Under the Rules, the Dean of Students has primary authority and responsibility for the administration of student discipline, but other University actors play various roles in responding to particular types of alleged violations. Case: 19-50529 Document: 00515631238 Page: 3 Date Filed: 11/09/2020 No. 19-50529 4 Disciplinary sanctions range from written warning to suspension, expulsion, and the denial of a degree. 2. Acceptable Use Policy The Acceptable Use Policy outlines permitted and prohibited uses of the information technology devices and systems provided and maintained by the University. Under the Policy “[a]ll university students granted access to or use of university Information Resources must be aware of and agree to abide by [certain] acceptable use requirements. ” Among these “requirements” is: 5.6 Be civil. Do not send rude or harassing correspondence. 1. If someone asks you to stop communicating with him or her, you should. If you fail to do so, the person can file a complaint and you can be disciplined. 2. If you ever feel that you are being harassed, university staff members will assist you in filing a complaint. . . . “The authoritative source on [the Acceptable Use Policy] and responsibility for its implementation rests with the Office of the Associate Vice President and Chief Information Officer,” although other offices may be involved in discipline relating to the requirements. The Policy provides a nonexhaustive list of “[p]unishment[s] for infractions of [the requirements],” ranging from “[v]erbal warnings” to “[s]uspension from the university” or “[c]riminal prosecution. ” The Policy notes that suspension from the University happens to “several people each semester. ” On the other hand, the Policy notes, “In general, expressions of opinion by members of the university community that do not otherwise violate state and federal laws or university rules are protected as ‘free speech.’” Also: “Disagreements between people, even heated arguments, unless threatening or otherwise unlawful, are not considered violations. UT Austin does, however, strongly encourage all its users to be polite and courteous. ” Case: 19-50529 Document: 00515631238 Page: 4 Date Filed: 11/09/2020 No. 19-50529 5 3. Residence Hall Manual The “Personal Responsibility and Student Conduct” section of the Residence Hall Manual includes sections on “Harassment” and “Incivility. ” Under “Harassment,” the University states a policy “to maintain an educational environment free from harassment and intimidation” and states a related “commit[ment] to responding appropriately to acts of racism, sexism, heterosexism, cissexism, ageism, ableism, and any other force that seeks to suppress another individual or group of individuals. ” “When acts of harassment or intimidation occur in the residence hall environment, the Residence Life staff, in conjunction with the Residence Hall Council, may lead a floor or hall meeting to discuss the incident and decide, as a community, appropriate steps that need to be taken to address the incident. ” More generally, “[r]esidents who are suspected to have engaged in harassment as defined in the Institutional Rules will be referred to the Dean of Students for possible disciplinary action. ” Immediately following, under “Incivility,” the University states: Students are expected to behave in a civil manner that is respectful of their community and does not disrupt academic or residential activity. Uncivil behaviors and language that interfere with the privacy, health, welfare, individuality, or safety of other persons are not permitted. At the end of the “Personal Responsibility and Student Conduct” section, there is a subsection on the “Conduct Process,” which explains the process for “cases that remain in Housing for adjudication. ” This process may result in “Housing Sanctions,” which are “educational measure[s] implemented by the Housing Conduct Board or Residence Hall Conduct Administrator designed to affect [sic] a change in behavior and to help the student understand how their behavior impacted others in the residence hall community. ” “Sanctions” might Case: 19-50529 Document: 00515631238 Page: 5 Date Filed: 11/09/2020 No. 19-50529 6 include “loss of privileges,” “assign[ments]” such as “on-line educational modules, meetings with University staff members, educational/reflection papers, poster assignments, or presentations at hall meetings,” or “administrative sanctions” such as a forced room change, fine, or bar on the student’s record. 4. Hate and Bias Incidents Policy and CCRT Finally, within the University’s Handbook of operating procedures is the “Hate and Bias Incidents” policy. According to its “Policy Statement,” the University “unequivocally condemns and prohibits . . . harassment,” “is committed to an academic and work environment free from acts of intolerance, hate, bias or prejudice,” and “is committed to the principles of free inquiry and expression and is dedicated to creating an environment where the expansion of knowledge and the freedom to exchange ideas is safeguarded. ” The Hate and Bias Incidents policy describes verbal harassment in the same language as the Institutional Rules. It specifies that individuals may report threatened or actual “harassment” to the Office of the Dean of Students or the Office of Inclusion and Equity. The policy’s “Responsibilities & Procedures” section includes a “Campus Climate Incident” subsection, which states: The University strongly encourages individuals who believe they have been discriminated against or have experienced threatened or actual violence on the basis of their race, color, religion, national origin, gender, gender identity or gender expression, age, disability, citizenship, veteran status, sexual orientation, ideology, political views, or political affiliation to report such incidents as provided in this policy. Individuals may report a campus climate incident to the University’s Campus Climate Response Team by clicking on the “Report a Bias Incident Campus Climate Response Team” button . . . . Individuals may report concerns such as a student Case: 19-50529 Document: 00515631238 Page: 6 Date Filed: 11/09/2020 No. 19-50529 7 organization hosting a party with a racist theme, derogatory graffiti regarding sexual orientation or gender identity and expression, malicious threats that intimidate another person because of his or her religion or concerns that someone has created a hostile or offensive classroom environment. The Campus Climate Response Team (“CCRT”) was instituted in 2011 after an investigation into whether the university’s dispute resolution procedures were sufficient to handle outbreaks of “hateful or violent speech. ” The CCRT is described as “a university-wide strategy resource team that develops and facilitates the implementation of appropriate responses to campus climate incidents impacting the UT Austin community. ” “[C]ore functions” of the CCRT include “[g]athering information and managing the specific incident,” “[s]upporting individuals involved in an incident,” “[i]dentifying and connecting with appropriate support services,” “[e]valuating the response process post incident,” and “[c]oordinating, when appropriate, activities with other campus-wide entities, especially those involved with crisis management. ” Last, the University hopes that “through the work of the CCRT, potential gaps in UT Austin policies and procedures that may impede the university’s ability to minimize campus climate incidents may be addressed. ” The CCRT acts in response to campus climate incident reports, which may be filed online by the “victim” of an alleged incident, a witness, or any third party “who was informed of the incident but was not present at the time of its occurrence. ” The reports may be anonymous. Upon filing, usually online, the report is examined by the CCRT Lead Team “to determine whether the situation, as reported, falls within the parameters of a campus climate incident or whether the incident should be referred to other response teams or offices. ” CCRT Lead Team members “will also determine if there is a possible violation of the [Institutional Rules]. ” Among other responses, the CCRT may decide to Case: 19-50529 Document: 00515631238 Page: 7 Date Filed: 11/09/2020 No. 19-50529 8 provide “support and information to student(s), staff or faculty who initiated the incident. ” Following the provision relating to the CCRT, the Hate and Bias Incidents Policy (re)authorizes the sanctions listed in the Institutional Rules and assures that “a discriminatory purpose will be treated as an aggravating factor for the purpose of determining the appropriate sanction(s). ” District Court Proceedings Speech First challenged all of these policies on their face. Nicole Neily, the president of Speech First, stated in a sworn declaration that the organization’s members “hold a wide array of different views and opinions on matters such as politics, race, religion, gender identity, abortion, gun rights, immigration, foreign affairs, and countless other sensitive and controversial topics. ” She stated further that Speech First’s members at the University “want to be able to have open and robust intellectual debates and discussion about these issues in their dormitories, on campus, online, and in the City of Austin,” but they are “afraid to voice their views out of fear that their speech may be considered ‘offensive,’ ‘biased,’ ‘rude,’ ‘uncivil,’ or ‘harassing.’” That is, they “fear that they will be investigated or punished by the University for engaging in speech or expression that is protected by the First Amendment. ” In its complaint, Speech First described more specifically the views of its student-members at the University. For example, it stated that one studentmember considers herself a “Tea Party conservative,” “strongly supports Israel, believes in a race-blind society, supports President Trump, is pro-life, and supports the border wall. ” Another student-member “strongly supports the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms, believes in a race-blind society, and has serious concerns that the ‘Me Too’ movement will erode due process. ” He thinks “affirmative action should be prohibited and that Justice Case: 19-50529 Document: 00515631238 Page: 8 Date Filed: 11/09/2020 No. 19-50529 9 Brett Kavanaugh was innocent of the accusations made against him and was properly confirmed to the U.S Supreme Court. ” A third student-member “believes that the breakdown of the nuclear family has had many negative effects on society, he is strongly pro-life, he strongly supports the Second Amendment, and he believes that Justice Kavanaugh was treated unfairly during his confirmation proceedings. ” Speech First sought a declaratory judgment that “the University’s prohibition on ‘verbal harassment,’’’ its “prohibitions on incivility, rudeness, and harassment in section 5.6 of the Acceptable Use Policy,” and its “prohibitions on harassment, intimidation, and incivility in the Residence Hall Manual” violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments. It also sought a declaratory judgment that “the CCRT and its prohibitions on ‘bias incidents’ and ‘campus climate incidents’ violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments. ” Speech First sought a permanent injunction prohibiting University officials from “taking any actions to investigate, threaten, or punish students for violations of the [allegedly unconstitutional policies]” and from “using the CCRT to investigate, threaten, or punish students (including informal punishments) for ‘bias incidents’ or ‘campus climate incidents.’” Soon after filing its complaint, Speech First moved for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the challenged policies and against use of the CCRT to investigate, log, threaten, or punish students for bias incidents. The University opposed the motion and attached declarations from a number of University officials. The court convened a non-evidentiary hearing directed at the preliminary injunction motion alone. A couple months later, the court issued an opinion dismissing Speech First’s case for lack of standing. The court ruled that Speech First had failed to present “specific evidence of the speech in which the students wish to Case: 19-50529 Document: 00515631238 Page: 9 Date Filed: 11/09/2020 No. 19-50529 10 engage,” leaving the court unable to determine whether the students “have an intention to engage in speech that is prohibited or arguably covered by the challenged policies. ” The court discerned “no evidence that any University students . . . have been disciplined, sanctioned, or investigated for their speech,” and thus no “credible threat of enforcement of the challenged policies. ” Concluding that Speech First failed to make a clear showing of standing and thus lacked standing to sue, the court not only denied the preliminary injunction but dismissed the case. Speech First filed its timely notice of appeal on June 6, 2019. Numerous amici filed briefs in support of Speech First. Unexpectedly, in August, pending appeal, the University amended its policies. First, it changed the prohibition on harassment in the Institutional Rules from banning “hostile or offensive speech” that is “severe, pervasive, or persistent” to banning “hostile or threatening” speech that is “severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive” (emphasis added). Second, the University eliminated the Acceptable Use Policy’s references to “civil” and “[not] rude or harassing correspondence. ” Third, the University eliminated the Residence Hall Manual’s prohibition on “uncivil behaviors and language” and redefined the Manual’s harassment rule to match strictly the Institutional Rules. See The University of Texas at Austin, 2019–2020 Residence Hall Manual 16 (Aug. 29, 2019), https://housing.utexas.edu/sites/default/files/ResidenceHallManual_10182019 .pdf Fourth, the University changed the Manual’s disciplinary process for harassment in order to channel all allegations of harassment directly to the Dean of Students, thus eliminating the separate Housing disciplinary process. See id. The University did not change either the CCRT or the Hate and Bias Incidents Policy, according to which the University continues to “unequivocally Case: 19-50529 Document: 00515631238 Page: 10 Date Filed: 11/09/2020 No. 19-50529 11 condemn[] and prohibit[] . . . harassment,” defined as “hostile or offensive speech” that is “sufficiently severe, pervasive, or persistent so as to interfere with an individual or group’s academic or work performance, or to create a hostile work or academic environment. ” The University of Texas at Austin, Hate and Bias Incidents Policy (Mar 8, 2017), https://policies.utexas.edu/policies/hate-and-bias-incidents. The policy remains enforceable as originally written. Students are “strongly encourage[d]” to report such speech to the CCRT. Id. DISCUSSION On appeal, Speech First seeks, at least, to reverse the district court’s dismissal for lack of standing. The University supports dismissal, but also contends that its policy amendments render moot appellant’s challenges to the original policies. We start with mootness. I. Mootness Because “the University consolidated and revised its policies governing expressive activities in time for the 2019–20 school year,” Fenves contends, “Speech First’s challenges to the Use Policy and Residence Hall Manual are focused exclusively on language that was eliminated by the University’s recent revisions. ” In addition to touting the changes, Fenves’s brief states that “the University has no plans to, and will not, reenact the former policies. ” As a result, Speech First’s challenges to the original versions of the Institutional Rules, Use Policy, and Residence Hall Manual have allegedly become moot. In general, “‘a defendant’s voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not deprive a federal court of its power to determine the legality of the practice,’ even in cases in which injunctive relief is sought. ” Meza v. Livingston, 607 F.3d 392, 399–400 (5th Cir. 2010) (quoting City of Mesquite v. Aladdin’s Castle, Inc., 455 U.S 283, 289, 102 S. Ct. 1070, 1074 (1982)). That Case: 19-50529 Document: 00515631238 Page: 11 Date Filed: 11/09/2020 No. 19-50529 12 general rule is not absolute, but “[v]oluntary cessation of challenged conduct” moots a case “only if it is ‘absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not be reasonably expected to recur.’” Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Slater, 528 U.S 216, 222, 120 S. Ct. 722, 725 (2000) (quoting United States v. Concentrated Phosphate Exp. Ass’n, 393 U.S 199, 203, 89 S. Ct. 361, 364 (1968)). In some cases this court has “treat[ed] a voluntary governmental cessation of possibly wrongful conduct with some solicitude,” Sossamon v. Lone Star State of Texas, 560 F.3d 316, 325 (5th Cir. 2009), aff’d sub nom. Sossamon v. Texas, 563 U.S 277, 131 S. Ct. 1651 (2011), but this relaxed standard has not been applied to voluntary cessation by a public university. We do not adopt the relaxed standard, but assume its applicability arguendo for purposes of this case. Even applying “some solicitude,” however, the continuing existence of the unaltered definition of “harassment” in the Hate and Bias Incidents Policy does not make it “absolutely clear” that the University will not reinstate its original policies. After all, that Policy maintains the exact definition of harassment that was eliminated from the Institutional Rules. Of course, the University could reconcile the contradictory policies by revising the Hate and Bias Incidents Policy to align with the newly fashioned Institutional Rules, but it could easily reconcile them in the opposite way. On that basis alone, the partial voluntary cessation does not moot this case. Mootness by voluntary cessation is further inadvisable to avoid a circuit split. This is not the first appeal in which a public university has had a sudden change of heart, during litigation, about the overbreadth and vagueness of its speech code, and then advocated mootness under a relaxed standard. In Speech First, Inc. v. Schlissel, the Sixth Circuit considered the alleged Case: 19-50529 Document: 00515631238 Page: 12 Date Filed: 11/09/2020 No. 19-50529 13 mootness of challenges to speech codes at the University of Michigan. 939 F.3d 756, 767–70 (6th Cir. 2019). The Schlissel court “presume[d] that the same allegedly wrongful conduct by the government is unlikely to recur. ” Id. at 767. Yet the Sixth Circuit held that presumption defeated for three reasons: (1) the absence of a controlling statement of future intention; (2) the suspicious timing of the change; and (3) the university’s continued defense of the challenged policies. Id. at 769–70. Following Schlissel, this case is not moot. To the first point, the University has not issued a controlling statement of future intention. Of course, Fenves, in his official capacity, represents in his brief that “[t]he University has no plans to, and will not, reenact the former policies. ” Schlissel, in contrast, reviewed sworn testimony to determine whether “the University has . . . affirmatively stated that it does not intend to reenact the challenged definitions. ” 939 F.3d at 769. The University advances no such sworn affirmative statement here. Schlissel looked to “evidence in the record that [the person making a statement] . . . has control over whether the University will reimplement the challenged definitions. ” There is no evidence here that Fenves controls whether the University will restore the challenged definitions during or after his tenure. Cf. United States v. Atkins, 323 F.2d 733, 739 (5th Cir. 1963); ACLU v. Fla. Bar, 999 F.2d 1486, 1494 (11th Cir. 1993). Indeed, the newly made policy amendments are being submitted to the Board of Regents for consideration sometime this year.3 Thus, Fenves’s statements in brief are not a controlling statement of future intention. 3 Cf. N.Y State Rifle & Pistol Ass’n v. City of New York, No. 18-280, 2020 WL 1978708, at *1 (U.S Apr. 27, 2020) (mootness resulted when City exercised its formal legislative powers to change an ordinance and “the State enacted a law making the old New York City ordinance illegal,” id. at *2 (Alito, J., dissenting)). Case: 19-50529 Document: 00515631238 Page: 13 Date Filed: 11/09/2020 No. 19-50529 14 Second, the timing of the University’s policy amendments is at least as suspicious as was the timing of the changes in Schlissel. In that case, the university changed its policies after the complaint was filed, albeit as part of a review process that preceded litigation. 939 F.3d at 769. In this case, the University did not commence review, much less change its policies, until after the district court decision. The changes were first announced only in the University’s appellate brief. Cf. Knox v. SEIU, 567 U.S 298, 307, 132 S. Ct. 2277, 2287 (2012) (“[M]aneuvers designed to insulate a decision from review by this Court must be viewed with a critical eye. ”). The University does not “explain the expedient timing of the [policies’] removal. ” Schlissel, 939 F.3d at 770. Finally, Fenves continues to defend the original policies originally as it did in the district court. His brief states, “The plain text of the challenged policies makes clear that none of the challenged policies . . . prohibits any constitutionally protected speech in general, and the types of speech in which Speech First’s members wish to engage in particular. ” (emphasis added). Although the points that follow extend to all the University provisions, original and amended, the University’s definitions of arguably protected conduct and the alleged lack of a history of past enforcement necessarily involve the preexisting policies. As in Schlissel, the University is still defending the legality of its original policies. Even if Schlissel required all three bases of its ruling to preclude mootness,4 all of them obtain here. Accordingly, even under Schlissel’s relaxed presumption in favor of a university’s voluntary cessation (which we apply only 4 Cf. DeJohn v. Temple Univ., 537 F.3d 301, 311 (3d Cir. 2008) (rejecting mootness by voluntary cessation after considering only the timing of a policy change and continued defense of contested policy). Case: 19-50529 Document: 00515631238 Page: 14 Date Filed: 11/09/2020 No. 19-50529 15 arguendo), Fenves has not shown an absolute certainty that the original provisions of its Institution Rules, Acceptable Use Policy, and Residence Hall Manual will not be reinstituted. Nor has Fenves even alleged mootness regarding the CCRT. Speech First’s challenges are not moot. II. Standing A preliminary injunction, like final relief, cannot be requested by a plaintiff who lacks standing to sue. At earlier stages of litigation, however, the manner and degree of evidence required to show standing is less than at later stages. See Lujan v. Def’s of Wildlife, 504 U.S 555, 561, 112 S. Ct. 2130 (1992) (“each element [of standing] must be supported . . . with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation”). At the preliminary injunction stage, the movant must clearly show only that each element of standing is likely to obtain in the case at hand. Compare Barber v. Bryant, 860 F.3d 345, 352 (5th Cir. 2017), with Pendergest-Holt v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd’s of London, 600 F.3d 562, 568–69 (5th Cir. 2010); see also Waskul v. Washtenaw Cty. Cmty. Mental Health, 900 F.3d 250, 256 n.4 (6th Cir. 2018); Food & Water Watch, Inc. v. Vilsack, 808 F.3d 905, 913 (D.C Cir. 2015). Because Speech First seeks a preliminary injunction on behalf of its members, it must clearly show that it likely has associational standing to bring its case on the merits. Speech First satisfies that requirement if it shows a likelihood that “(a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization’s purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit. ” Int’l Union, United Auto., Aerospace & Agr. Implement Workers of Am. v. Brock, 477 U.S 274, 282, Case: 19-50529 Document: 00515631238 Page: 15 Date Filed: 11/09/2020 No. 19-50529 16 106 S. Ct. 2523, 2529 (1986) (quoting Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Advert. Comm’n, 432 U.S 333, 343, 97 S. Ct. 2434, 2441 (1977)). The only one of those criteria disputed here is whether it is likely that any of Speech First’s members would have standing to sue in his own right.5 To have standing, a plaintiff must (1) have suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant, and (3) that will likely be redressed by a favorable decision. Lujan v. Def’s of Wildlife, 504 U.S 555, 560–61, 112 S. Ct. 2130 (1992). A plaintiff has suffered an injury in fact if he (1) has an “intention to engage in a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest,” (2) his intended future conduct is “arguably . . . proscribed by [the policy in question],” and (3) “the threat of future enforcement of the [challenged policies] is substantial. ” See Susan B. Anthony List, 573 U.S at 161–64, 134 S. Ct. at 2343–45. For purposes of a preliminary junction, Speech First must clearly show a likelihood that at least one of its members suffered such an injury. The gravamen of Speech First’s claims is that its student-members wish to engage in robust debate on timely and controversial political topics from a contrarian point of view. Because their views do not mirror those of many on campus, their speech may be deemed “harassment,” “rude,” “uncivil,” or “offensive,” as those terms are defined in the University’s policies. Their speech may also credibly run afoul of the Hate and Bias Incidents Policy and may be investigated by the CCRT. Either way, credible threats of enforcement exist under these policies or through referral from the CCRT. Alleging a facial 5 The latter two elements of associational standing are uncontested. Speech First’s purpose is “to preserv[e] civil rights secured by law, including the freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment to the U.S Constitution,” especially for the sake of “students and others at colleges and universities, through litigation and other lawful means. ” The student speech interests are germane to its purpose, and neither the claims nor the relief sought require the participation of individual members in the lawsuit. Case: 19-50529 Document: 00515631238 Page: 16 Date Filed: 11/09/2020 No. 19-50529 17 challenge to these rules, Speech First insists that its members’ First Amendment rights have been chilled, their speech deterred, by the prospect of adverse application of the policies. This court has repeatedly held, in the pre-enforcement context, that “[c]hilling a plaintiff’s speech is a constitutional harm adequate to satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement. ” Houston Chronicle v. City of League City, 488 F.3d 613, 618 (5th Cir. 2007). See also Freedom Path, Inc. v. I.R.S , 913 F.3d 503, 507 (5th Cir. 2019) (same); Fairchild v. Liberty ISD, 597 F.3d 747, 754–55 (5th Cir. 2010) (same); Ctr. for Individual Freedom v. Carmouche, 449 F.3d 655, 660 (5th Cir. 2010) (same) (“As the district court noted, ‘[t]he First Amendment challenge has unique standing issues because of the chilling effect, selfcensorship, and in fact the very special nature of political speech itself.’”).6 It is not hard to sustain standing for a pre-enforcement challenge in the highly sensitive area of public regulations governing bedrock political speech. A. Intention to Engage in Protected Conduct Concerning the first criterion enunciated in Susan B. Anthony List, Fenves attempts only in a footnote to defend the district court’s erroneous conclusion that Speech First did not adequately support its members’ intentions to engage in speech protected by the First Amendment. Speech First’s complaint alleged that one of its student-members at the University “wants to engage in open and robust intellectual debate with her fellow students” about, for example, “open borders and the protection of illegal immigrants,” “the BDS movement to end support for Israel,” and opposition to 6 Other circuits concur. See, e.g , Ariz. Right to Life PAC v. Bayless, 320 F.3d 1002, 1006 (9th Cir. 2003) (plaintiff forced to modify political behavior had standing); Majors v. Abell, 317 F.3d 719, 721 (7th Cir. 2003) (if statute “arguably covers” plaintiff’s speech, “and so may deter constitutionally protected expression . . . , there is standing”) (citing Virginia v. Am. Booksellers’ Ass’n, Inc., 484 U.S 383, at 392–93 (1988)). Case: 19-50529 Document: 00515631238 Page: 17 Date Filed: 11/09/2020 No. 19-50529 18 “the President. ” This student “wants to speak passionately and forcefully about these issues” and wants to point out the flaws in her fellow students’ arguments and encourage her fellow students to change their minds. ” Speech First alleges that two more student-members have similar, and similarly concrete, plans. These allegations and others were supported by the Neily Declaration.7 According to that sworn statement, “Speech First has a number of members who are current students at the University of Texas at Austin. ” Further, the association’s members at the University wish to engage in debates and discussions covering “a wide array of different views on matters such as politics, race, religion, gender identity, abortion, gun rights, immigration, foreign affairs, and countless other sensitive and controversial topics. ” The Neily Declaration avers that students “are afraid to voice their views out of fear that their speech” may violate University policies. For purposes of a preliminary injunction, the Declaration substantiates the allegations raised in the complaint, and Fenves suggests no grounds to doubt its veracity.8 It is at least likely, therefore, that Speech First’s three student-members at the University have an intention to engage in a certain course of conduct, 7 In this way, Speech First differs from the plaintiffs in National Federation of the Blind of Texas, Inc. v. Abbott, a case cited by the district court. In that case, “the stipulated facts [were] silent” as to whether the plaintiffs intended to engage in the relevant activity. 647 F.3d 202, 209 (5th Cir. 2011). Speech First alleges, however, with support in the record, its members’ direct intention to engage in the particular activity that it alleges to be arguably regulated by the challenged provisions. 8 Contrast that with two cases cited by the district court. In Mississippi State Democratic Party v. Barbour, a political party declared an intention to hold a closed primary for the first time ever, without support in the record, without having adopted any policy or taken any vote on the matter, and without having pursued necessary preclearance from the Department of Justice to hold such a primary. 529 F.3d 538, 545 (2008). That dubiously alleged group intention bears no resemblance to the uncontested individual intention alleged and supported here. And in Zimmerman v. City of Austin, the candidate who challenged municipal campaign funding restrictions had no demonstrated intention whatsoever to accept donations exceeding the limits. 881 F.3d 378, 382 (5th Cir. 2018). Case: 19-50529 Document: 00515631238 Page: 18 Date Filed: 11/09/2020 No. 19-50529 19 namely political speech. Moreover, “[b]ecause [their] intended future conduct concerns political speech, it is certainly ‘affected with a constitutional interest.’” Susan B. Anthony List, 573 U.S at 162, 134 S. Ct. at 2344. Speech First satisfies the first element of injury-in-fact. B. Arguably Proscribed Next, Speech First must clearly show a likelihood that its members’ constitutionally protected speech is arguably proscribed, or at least arguably regulated, by the University speech policies. See id.; Laird v. Tatum, 408 U.S 1, 11, 92 S. Ct. 2318, 2324 (1972) (“[C]onstitutional violations may arise from the deterrent, or ‘chilling,’ effect of governmental regulations that fall short of a direct prohibition against the exercise of First Amendment rights. ”); see also Schlissel, 939 F.3d at 764–65. As has been noted, Speech First members plan to engage the University community in debate encompassing a broad array of controversial political topics. Comparably broad, however, are the categories of speech arguably covered by the University’s Institutional Rule on “verbal harassment,” the Acceptable Use Policy’s requirement to be “civil” and not to send “rude” correspondence, the Residence Hall Manual proscriptions of “harassment,” “intimidation,” and “incivility,” and the Hate and Bias Incidents policies against “bias incident[s]” and “campus climate incident[s]. ” Terms like “harassment,” “intimidation,” “rude,” “incivility,” and “bias” beg for clarification.9 These pejoratives arguably cover the plaintiffs’ intended speech. Adding credibility to their argument, the University itself eliminated or materially altered the challenged definitions—pending appeal. It is far9 Similar terms have in fact been declared overbroad and vague when embedded in speech policies at other universities. See, e.g , Dambrot, 55 F.3d at 1182–84. Case: 19-50529 Document: 00515631238 Page: 19 Date Filed: 11/09/2020 No. 19-50529 20 fetched to suppose that the policies were amended in a relevant way absent any likelihood that they arguably covered Speech First’s members’ speech. Undeterred, Fenves argues the policies have no bearing on the students’ speech. He denies that any speech at all is “arguably proscribed” except by the Institutional Rules.10 Ostensibly, the other speech regulations must be precatory, not sanctionable. In addition, he commends the policies’ provisions that declare the value of free speech and argumentation. First, even assuming that actual proscription is necessary, contra Laird, 408 U.S at 11, 92 S. Ct. at 2324; Schlissel, 939 F.3d at 764–65, the Institutional Rules are not the exclusive vehicle for imposing speech penalties. The Acceptable Use Policy lists “punitive sanctions,” all the way up to “criminal prosecution. ” The Residential Hall Manual threatens, in addition to referral to the Dean of Students for punishment under the Institutional Rules, independent Housing sanctions for violating the Manual’s rules. Such sanctions include compelled participation in educational modules, paperwriting, and presentations, as well as room reassignment and more. Finally, the Hate and Bias Incidents Policy provides for “Interim Measures and Final Sanctions,” including suspension from campus, residence hall, or classes—or any of the sanctions authorized in the Institutional Rules. It is uncontradicted, to be sure, that “the Dean of Students testified that ‘[s]tudent discipline is administered only for violations of the Institutional 10 Parroting the district court, Fenves also contends that the “relevant inquiry is whether the policy actually prohibits the speech in question—not whether some might mistakenly believe it does. ” This is wrong. Under Susan B. Anthony List, the question is simply whether speech is “arguably . . . proscribed by” the challenged policies. ” 573 U.S at 162, 134 S. Ct. at 2344; see also Babbitt v. United Farm Workers Nat’l Union, 442 U.S 289, 298, 99 S. Ct. 2301, 2309 (1979). Even though a plaintiff does not intend to violate a policy, the policy’s language may still be claimed to fall within the statutory regulation, e.g , of “false” statements, and the plaintiff may thus have standing. 573 U.S at 163, 134 S. Ct. at 2344– 45. Case: 19-50529 Document: 00515631238 Page: 20 Date Filed: 11/09/2020 No. 19-50529 21 Rules.’” Nevertheless, in light of the plain language concerning sanctions in all of the challenged policies, the Dean appears to have testified as to definition, indicating that “student discipline” is the University’s name only for what follows from violations of the Institutional Rules. In contrast, sanctions described in the Residence Hall Manual, for example, are not “student discipline” but rather “educational measure[s] implemented by the Housing Conduct Board or Residence Hall Conduct Administrator designed to affect [sic] a change in behavior and to help the student understand how their behavior impacted others in the residence hall community. ” The Dean and University are entitled to their own definitions, but their nomenclature does not alter reality and does not contradict the proscriptive nature of the policies. Nor is it tenable, as the district court found, that the CCRT “does not engage in investigations or punishment of any sort. ” The implicit suggestion here is that, insofar as the Hate and Bias Incidents Policy is enforced by the CCRT, it is not sufficiently proscriptive. This point fails under Schlissel. In that case, the court “recognize[d] that [the University of Michigan’s Bias Response Team] lacks any disciplinary power and that bias incidents are not directly punishable. ” 939 F.3d at 765. Nevertheless, it found that “[t]he Response Team’s ability to make referrals—i.e , to inform [the Office of Student Conflict Resolution] or the police about reported conduct—is a real consequence that objectively chills speech. ” Id. So, too, when the “CCRT determines there is a possible violation of the university’s [Institutional Rules] or policies outlined in the General Information Catalog, [the] CCRT refers the Case: 19-50529 Document: 00515631238 Page: 21 Date Filed: 11/09/2020 No. 19-50529 22 incident to the appropriate entity. ” Under Schlissel, a policy thus enforced is sufficiently proscriptive to objectively chill student speech.11 Fenves ultimately wraps the University in the flag of its policies’ paeans to the freedom of speech. According to Fenves, “the University’s policies expressly protect and encourage [the speech at issue]. ” Without exception, he contends, the Institutional Rules, Acceptable Use Policy, and Residence Hall Manual, respectively, exclude arguments about ideas from “verbal harassment,” affirm the “great value of freedom of thought and expression,” and “encourage all members of [the University’s] community to support the freedom of speech. ” Examined more closely, however, none of these statements detracts from the likelihood that the University’s policies arguably cover Speech First’s members’ intended speech. First, the Residence Hall Manual’s “encourage[ment]” of the freedom of speech does not appear in the sections on “Harassment” and “Incivility,” nor anywhere in the chapter on “Personal Responsibility and Student Conduct. ” Instead, it appears in a subsection of the Guidelines on “Posters,” where freedom of speech is qualified by admonishments to “respect the mission and value[] . . . [of] providing all residents with a ‘comfortable, friendly environment’ and ‘sense of community’” and to “not engage in gratuitously offensive expression. ” Second, the Acceptable Use Policy states that “[w]e do not punish or prevent expression that . . . violates no specific law or university regulation” and that “[i]n general, expressions of opinion by members of the university community that do not otherwise violate state and federal laws or university rules are protected as 11 Accordingly, we need not consider, for example, Speech First’s suggestion that the CCRT’s public logging of incidents in a manner easily identifiable by members of the University community also indicates that the Hate and Bias Incidents Policy is proscriptive. Case: 19-50529 Document: 00515631238 Page: 22 Date Filed: 11/09/2020 No. 19-50529 23 ‘free speech’” (emphasis added). The Residence Hall Manual and Acceptable Use Policy clearly delimit the freedom of speech by their prohibitions, not the other way around. The Institutional Rules, on the other hand, explicitly exclude from “verbal harassment” the “mak[ing] [of] an argument for or against the substance of any political, religious, philosophical, ideological, or academic idea. ” Fenves suggests that this phrase “straightforwardly conveys that the exclusion applies to speech that conveys the substance of an idea” and is qualified only to discourage expression extraneous to the idea itself. We disagree. Stated more precisely, the definition is this: “verbal harassment” includes “hostile or offensive” speech that “is not necessary to the expression of any idea [defined as “an argument for or against the substance of any political . . . idea]. ”12 Interpreted grammatically, the exclusion applies only to speech that conveys the substance of an idea and is necessary to such conveyance. Such a qualified limitation on the scope of the term “verbal harassment” increases rather than decreases its uncertainty. In sum, while purporting to invoke free speech, the Institutional Rules qualify protected speech and fail to cabin the terms “harassment,” 12 Section 13–204(b)(1) and (2) state in full: 1. “Verbal harassment” means hostile or offensive speech, oral, written, or symbolic, that A. is not necessary to the expression of any idea described in subsection 13–204(b)(2); B. is sufficiently severe, pervasive, or persistent to create an objectively hostile environment that interferes with or diminishes the victim’s ability to participate in or benefit from the services, activities, or privileges provided by the University; and C. personally describes or is personally directed to one or more specific individuals. 2. To make an argument for or against the substance of any political, religious, philosophical, ideological, or academic idea is not verbal harassment, even if some listeners are offended by the argument or idea. The categories of sexually harassing speech set forth in Policy 3-3031 of the Handbook of Operating Procedures are rarely, if ever, necessary to argue for or against the substance of any political, religious, philosophical, ideological, or academic idea. Case: 19-50529 Document: 00515631238 Page: 23 Date Filed: 11/09/2020 No. 19-50529 24 “intimidation,” “rude[eness],” “incivility,” and “bias. ” It is likely that the University’s policies arguably proscribe speech of the sort that Speech First’s members intend to make. C. Substantial Threat of Future Enforcement The last element of injury in fact, in this context, is whether it is clearly likely that “the future threat of enforcement of the [challenged policy] is substantial. ” Susan B. Anthony List, 573 U.S at 164, 134 S. Ct. at 2345. At this point, “[t]he distinction between facial and as-applied challenges bears legal significance. ” See Schlissel, 939 F.3d at 766. Whereas “[t]here must be some evidence that [a] rule would be applied to the plaintiff in order for that plaintiff to bring an as-applied challenge,” that is not the case for facial challenges. Id.; accord Carmouche, 449 F.3d 655, 659 (5th Cir. 2006); see also Google Inc. v. Hood, 822 F.3d 212, 227–28 (5th Cir. 2016) (involving no facial challenge). Instead, “when dealing with pre-enforcement challenges to recently enacted (or, at least, non-moribund) statutes that facially restrict expressive activity by the class to which the plaintiff belongs, courts will assume a credible threat of prosecution in the absence of compelling contrary evidence. ” N.H Right to Life PAC v. Gardner, 99 F.3d 8, 15 (1st Cir. 1996); accord Carmouche, 449 F.3d at 660; McCauley v. Univ. of the V.I , 618 F.3d 232, 237–39 (3d Cir. 2010) (determining standing based on policies alone); Ariz. Right to Life PAC v. Bayless, 320 F.3d 1002, 1006–07 (9th Cir. 2003); Majors v. Abell, 317 F.3d 719, 721 (7th Cir. 2003); N.C Right to Life, Inc. v. Bartlett, 168 F.3d 705, 710 (4th Cir. 1999). The University of Texas members of Speech First plainly belong to a class arguably facially restricted by the University policies. Not only this, Speech First has also shown, by producing the University’s public log of bias incidents, that the Hate and Bias Incidents Policy has been resorted to Case: 19-50529 Document: 00515631238 Page: 24 Date Filed: 11/09/2020 No. 19-50529 25 countless times regarding hundreds of events since 2012. Significantly, the largest numbers of reported complaints have related to Israel and affirmative action, two topics on which Speech First member Student A, for example, intends to speak. Such evidence establishes a threat of enforcement, not only of the Hate and Bias Incidents Policy, but also of the University’s other intertwined policies. The Hate and Bias Incidents Policy, after all, specifically refers to the Institutional Rules, as do the CCRT webpage and the Residence Hall Manual regarding the same issues. In addition, the Institutional Rules on speech specifically refer to the Acceptable Use Policy for “[r]ules protecting and regulating speech on University computer networks. ” These overlapping policies strongly suggest that enforcement of one produces a credible threat of enforcement of the others. Speech First has clearly shown a credible threat of enforcement of those policies upon its members. Fenves disagrees with the sufficiency of this showing based on case law and on “compelling contrary evidence” that belies a credible threat of prosecution. The district court focused on the proffered declarations of University officials that no sanctions had been imposed for violating the challenged policies. On the case law, Fenves notes, Laird holds that “a complainant who alleges that the exercise of his First Amendment rights is being chilled by the mere existence, without more, of a governmental investigative and datagathering activity” faces no substantial threat of future harm. 408 U.S at 10, 14, 92 S. Ct. at 2324. This holding was necessitated by the facts of the case. But Laird also contrasted the facts before it with a number of cases where “this Court has found . . . that constitutional violations may arise from the deterrent, or ‘chilling,’ effect of governmental regulations that fall short of a direct prohibition against the exercise of First Amendment rights. ” Id. Case: 19-50529 Document: 00515631238 Page: 25 Date Filed: 11/09/2020 No. 19-50529 26 (citations omitted). Standing existed in the Court’s prior cases because “the complainant was either presently or prospectively subject to the regulations, proscriptions, or compulsions he was challenging. ” Id. at 11, 2325. Thus, according to Laird, a plaintiff who belongs in a class subject to the challenged policies has standing, while one who only resides in a country that maintains policies with which he disagrees, but who fails to allege himself personally subject to the policies, does not. Id. at 13, 2326. Laird does not prevent these plaintiffs, who are arguably covered by the allegedly unconstitutional policies, from having standing. In a second thrust at Speech First’s invocation of Gardner, Fenves quotes Carmouche, in which this court required more than “the mere existence of an allegedly vague or overbroad statute. ” 449 F.3d at 660. This is in harmony with Laird. That Carmouche relied on a history of past enforcement to show a substantial threat of future enforcement does not contradict Laird’s acknowledgement that a plaintiff who is subject to a regulation or proscription has standing to sue. Either type of evidence may establish “a fear of prosecution that is not ‘imaginary or wholly speculative.’” Id. (quoting Babbitt v. United Farm Workers Nat’l Union, 442 U.S 289, 302, 99 S. Ct. 2301, 2311 (1979)). As the Seventh Circuit explained, a plaintiff who mounts a preenforcement statutory challenge on First Amendment grounds “need not show that the authorities have threatened to prosecute him . . . ; the threat is latent in the existence of the statute. ” Majors, 317 F.3d at 721. Finally, Clapper v. Amnesty International USA imposes no obstacle to finding a threat in this case that is likely substantial. In Clapper, the Supreme Court determined that the plaintiffs were in a class that, under the challenged statute, could not be targeted. 568 U.S 398, 411, 133 S. Ct. 1138, 1148 (2013). Having established this, the Court looked for a history of enforcement or Case: 19-50529 Document: 00515631238 Page: 26 Date Filed: 11/09/2020 No. 19-50529 27 specific facts13 about the government’s targeting practices that might yet give rise to a substantial threat of enforcement. Id. The Court did not suggest, however, that if the plaintiffs had been the subject of the challenged policies, such evidence would have been necessary. Unsurprisingly, in Blum v. Holder, the First Circuit determined that “Clapper does not call into question the assumption that the state will enforce its own non-moribund criminal laws, absent evidence to the contrary. ” 744 F.3d 790, 798 n.11 (1st Cir. 2014) (citing Gardner, 99 F.3d at 15). The standard articulated in Gardner remains sound. Turning to the argument that the University offered “compelling contrary evidence” to the presumption of enforcement, Fenves alleges an absence of relevant past enforcement of the University’s policies. He reiterates the speech-protecting language of the policies in question and points to declarations by University officials to support that the University lacks any intention to penalize the intended conduct of Speech First’s members. This evidence is not compelling. First, both Fenves and a former Dean of Students assert that they know of no instance in which the University speech policies have been enforced against the speech topics described by Speech First.14 Past enforcement of speech-related policies can assure standing, but as the foregoing discussion shows, a lack of past enforcement does not alone doom a claim of standing. See, e.g , Carmouche, 449 F.3d at 660 (“Controlling precedent . . . establishes that a chilling of speech because of the mere existence of an allegedly vague or overbroad [law] can be sufficient injury 13 Unlike this case, Clapper reviewed dismissal for lack of standing at the summary judgment stage, at which a plaintiff “can no longer rest on . . . ‘mere allegations,’ but must ‘set forth’ by affidavit or other evidence ‘specific facts.’” Id. at 412, 1148–49. 14 There is no reason to doubt their statements, which are based only on their personal experience; but on the other hand, the University’s student disciplinary records were unavailable to Speech First at this stage of litigation. Case: 19-50529 Document: 00515631238 Page: 27 Date Filed: 11/09/2020 No. 19-50529 28 to support standing. ”). Where the policy remains non-moribund, the claim is that the policy causes self-censorship among those who are subject to it, and the students’ speech is arguably regulated by the policy, there is standing. See, e.g , Schlissel, 939 F.3d at 766 (fact that “there is no evidence in the record” of past enforcement “misses the point”). Second, as was discussed above, the policies’ protection for student free speech “rights” is qualified and limited by required adherence to “university rules. ” And third, University officials’ disavowals of any future intention to enforce the policies contrary to the First Amendment are compatible with, and simply reinforce, the open-ended language in those policies. The difficulty with such disavowals is that regulations governing “rude,” “uncivil,” “harassing,” or “offensive” speech can in fact cover speech otherwise protected by the First Amendment. See Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U.S 443, 131 S. Ct. 1207 (2011); Vill. of Skokie v. Nat’l Socialist Party of Am., 373 N.E.2d 21, 23 (Ill. 1978).15 Moreover, the University continues to defend the use of these terms. Even more to the point, if there is no history of inappropriate or unconstitutional past enforcement, and no intention to pursue discipline against students under these policies for speech that is protected by the First Amendment, then why maintain the policies at all? At least, why maintain the plethora of potential sanctions? After all, the University regulatory policy for speech, including the Acceptable Use Policy, could have stated succinctly that students will be disciplined, up to and including academic punishment 15 This difficulty is not avoided by the University’s reliance on Blum. The Blum court construed a federal statute and, in doing so, exercised special “rigor[ ]” due to separation of powers concerns. 744 F.3d at 797. The statute in that case specifically targeted conduct, violent threats, and economic damage, but specifically excluded criminal liability for protected First Amendment conduct. 744 F.3d at 794. The government’s disavowal of prosecutions for protected speech thus had a secure statutory basis, unlike the disavowals here. Case: 19-50529 Document: 00515631238 Page: 28 Date Filed: 11/09/2020 No. 19-50529 29 and criminal referral, for speech that is outside the protection of the First Amendment and, perhaps, Title IX, which covers sexual harassment in institutions receiving federal funds.16 A reasonable observer must deduce that the University meant to expand its regulatory authority beyond the First Amendment; consequently, a reasonable student must act on the same assumption and self-censor her speech in accord with the perceived policies. Adding to the credible threat that the policies pose to the exercise of protected speech are two other circumstances: the University’s awareness that verbal harassment policies must be applied “narrowly” and the operation of the Hate and Bias Incidents Policy, through the CCRT, to deter those who would express controversial views. The Institutional Rules’ definition of verbal harassment consumes nearly a full page of small type. This alone might raise questions about vagueness, but the uncertainty is magnified by the University’s caveat that: Verbal harassment has been interpreted very narrowly by the federal courts. Policies on verbal harassment or hate speech at many universities have been held unconstitutional . . . . This policy should be interpreted as narrowly as need be to preserve its constitutionality. Put in terms of prospective enforcement, what does this mean? Surely it reasonably implies that the University will protect and enforce its verbal harassment policy as far as possible, but the distance to that horizon is unknown by the University and unknowable to those regulated by it. Likewise, insofar as the CCRT’s evaluations of bias incident reports is based on the same definition of verbal harassment, the entire University community has been encouraged to and has funneled into the CCRT hundreds 16 Davis v. Monroe Cty. Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S 629, 119 S. Ct. 1661 (1999). Whether Davis may constitutionally support purely verbal harassment claims, much less speechrelated proscriptions outside Title IX protected categories has not been decided by the Supreme Court or this court and seems self-evidently dubious. Case: 19-50529 Document: 00515631238 Page: 29 Date Filed: 11/09/2020 No. 19-50529 30 of wide-ranging complaints. Moreover, the CCRT has “referred” a large number of reporting individuals “to appropriate sources of support and/or coordinate[d] with a university entity as appropriate. ” The CCRT describes its work, judgmentally, in terms of “targets” and “initiators” of incidents. Further, examples of CCRT responses to reported incidents have included “facilitating conversation between those who were targeted by and those who initiated an incident; and making referrals to campus resources such as the UT Austin Police Department, the Office of the Dean of Students, and the Office for Inclusion and Equity (OIE). ” The CCRT, in some measure, represents the clenched fist in the velvet glove of student speech regulation. That the CCRT invites anonymous reports carries particular overtones of intimidation to students whose views are “outside the mainstream. ” As one expert explains, “[i]n both concept and design, such efforts [by “bias response teams”] to encourage students to anonymously initiate disciplinary proceedings for perceived acts of bias or to shelter themselves from disagreeable ideas are likely to subvert free and open inquiry and invite fears of political favoritism. ” Keith Whittington, Free Speech and the Diverse University, 87 Fordham L. Rev. 2453, 2466 (2019); see also Hon. Jose Cabranes, For Freedom of Expression, For Due Process, and For Yale: The Emerging Threat to Academic Freedom at a Great University, 35 Yale L. & Pol. Rev. 345, 360 (2017) (lamenting potential dangers of anonymous reports and recordkeeping by campus bias “police”). For these reasons, the existence of the University’s policies, which the University plans to maintain as far as a federal court will allow it, suffices to establish that the threat of future enforcement, against those in a class whose speech is arguably restricted, is likely substantial. And such likelihood is all that is necessary to establish the final prong of injury-in-fact for standing to Case: 19-50529 Document: 00515631238 Page: 30 Date Filed: 11/09/2020 No. 19-50529 31 seek a preliminary injunction in this kind of case. Speech First has established an injury in fact. D. Causation and Redressability As in Carmouche, “[t]he causation and redressability prongs of the standing inquiry are easily satisfied here. ” 449 F.3d at 661. After all, “[p]otential enforcement of the [challenged policies] caused [Speech First’s members’] self-censorship, and the injury could be redressed by enjoining enforcement of [those policies]. ” Id. Accordingly, Speech First has standing to seek a preliminary injunction. III. Remaining Factors On the record before us, the case is not moot, and the plaintiff has standing to seek a preliminary injunction. For purposes of a preliminary injunction, the next step would be to consider whether Speech First is likely to succeed on the merits. Because the district court did not move to the merits, though, and because the new language Fenves proposes might yet be adopted by formal procedures of the Board of Regents and might—or might not—moot certain issues, we must remand to the district court for reassessment of the preliminary injunction. At the same time, we note the consistent line of cases that have uniformly found campus speech codes unconstitutionally overbroad or vague.17 17 See, e.g , McCauley, 618 F.3d 232; DeJohn, 537 F.3d 301; Dambrot, 55 F.3d 1177; Shaw v.

Supp. 1163 (E.D Wis. 1991); Doe v. Univ. of Mich., 721 F. Supp. 852 (E.D Mich. 1989). Case: 19-50529 Document: 00515631238 Page: 31 Date Filed: 11/09/2020 No. 19-50529 32 Of course, not every utterance is worth protecting18 under the First Amendment. In our current national condition, however, in which “institutional leaders, in a spirit of panicked damage control, are delivering hasty and disproportionate punishment instead of considered reforms,”19 courts must be especially vigilant against assaults on speech in the Constitution’s care. Otherwise, the people may not “be free to generate, debate, and discuss both general and specific ideas, hopes, and experiences,” to “transmit their resulting views and conclusions to their elected representatives,” “to influence the public policy enacted by elected representatives,”20 and thereby to realize the political and human common good.21 CONCLUSION The judgment of the district court is VACATED, and we REMAND the case to proceed in light of this decision. 18 See generally John Finnis, Reason in Action: Collected Essays Volume I 277–324 (2011); Harvey C.

Tong Calls on Facebook to Take Stronger Steps to Prevent Use of Its Platforms to Spread Hate and Disinformation,False,"Connecticut Attorney General William Tong issued the following news release on Aug. 5:
Attorney General William Tong today joined 19 attorneys general from across the United States in calling on Facebook to take additional steps to prevent their site from being used to spread hate and disinformation. The attorneys general also urged Facebook to provide stronger support for users who fall victim to online intimidation and harassment on its platforms.
In a letter today to Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, the attorneys general assert that despite its stated commitment to working to keep its user community safe, Facebook has fallen short in keeping hate content off its platforms and protecting users from online harassment.
The letter follows the release of a Civil Rights Audit of Facebook's practices -- commissioned by the company and completed in July--that faults Facebook for failing to advance civil rights, and refusing to enforce its own policies against dangerous organizations and individuals, including white supremacists and other extremists.
Recent surveys suggest more than 40 percent of Americans have experienced some form of online harassment, and that of those victims, more than 75 percent have reported being harassed on Facebook.
""Trolls, hate groups and foreign actors use Facebook as a weapon of choice to spread vile and racist disinformation. Facebook can and must do more to protect its users from hate speech, harassment and intimidation,"" said Attorney General Tong.
The reforms recommended in today's letter, many of which are highlighted in the recent Civil Rights Audit, include calls for Facebook to:
* Aggressively enforce its policies against hate speech and organized hate organizations;
* Allow public, third-party audits of hate content and enforcement;
* Commit to an ongoing, independent analysis of Facebook's content population scheme and the prompt development of best practices guidance; and
* Expand policies limiting inflammatory advertisements that vilify minority groups;
The Attorneys General also recommends steps to enhance Facebook supportive services including:
* Offer live real-time assistance to victims of intimidation and harassment;
* Make information about unlawful harassment and intimidation more readily available; and
* Strengthen filtering, reporting, and blocking tools.
In addition to Connecticut, attorneys general representing the following jurisdictions are participating in today's letter: California, District of Columbia, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, Vermont and Wisconsin. The letter was led by New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal, District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine, and Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul.

Mark Zuckerberg, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Sheryl Sandberg, Chief Operating Officer, Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, California 94025
Dear Mr. Zuckerberg & Ms. Sandberg:
We, the undersigned State Attorneys General, write to request that you take additional steps to prevent Facebook from being used to spread disinformation and hate and to facilitate discrimination. We also ask that you take more steps to provide redress for users who fall victim to intimidation and harassment, including violence and digital abuse.
Our nation is in the midst of a reckoning on issues of racial justice and civil rights. As State Attorneys General, we have witnessed firsthand how the country's longstanding undercurrent of discrimination has burst into the open, as reports of hate crimes and bias incidents of all kinds have dramatically increased in recent years./1 And while recent events have further highlighted the systemic injustice that persists in our society, the last few months also have seen millions of Americans join together to call for action against bias and racism.
As you know, Facebook is not immune to these problems. Although Facebook has made some progress in counteracting the use of its platform to dehumanize and demean, that is just the beginning of what is necessary./2 Private parties, organized groups, and public officials continue to use Facebook to spread misinformation and project messages of hate against different groups of Americans. In many cases, these messages lead to intimidation and harassment of particular individuals online.
According to recent surveys, more than forty percent of Americans have experienced some form of online harassment, including cyberstalking, doxing (maliciously publishing someone's personal information), and swatting (filing false police reports to prompt a law enforcement response targeting the victim)./3 Of those Americans who report having been harassed online, more than three-quarters have reported being harassed on Facebook./4 Much of that harassment is focused on characteristics protected by the civil rights laws that many of us are charged with enforcing, including race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender and gender identity, and disability./5 Recourse is unavailable for too many of these victims, due to limitations on the services that Facebook offers victims and other impediments to securing relief through civil lawsuits or criminal prosecutions.
We understand that Facebook has committed to the public and its users that it will ""invest billions of dollars each year to keep [Facebook's] community safe and continuously work with outside experts to review and update [Facebook's] policies.""/6 But, as the most recent Civil Rights Audit reveals, the steps you have taken thus far have fallen short. With the vast resources at your disposal, we believe there is much more that you can do to prevent the use of Facebook as a vehicle for misinformation and discrimination, and to prevent your users from being victimized by harassment and intimidation on your platforms.
As State Attorneys General, we are responsible for protecting the safety and wellbeing of all the communities we serve. As part of that mission, we must constantly contend with the impacts of online hate, intimidation, and harassment. Many of our offices enforce the laws that protect our residents from bias offenses, intimidation, and harassment--whether online or on our streets./7 And many of our offices include units dedicated to serving the victims of unlawful conduct, including helping them access and use tools that allow them to vindicate their rights. As part of our responsibilities to our communities, Attorneys General have helped residents navigate Facebook's processes for victims to address abuse on its platform. While Facebook has--on occasion--taken action to address violations of its terms of service in cases where we have helped elevate our constituents' concerns,/8 we know that everyday users of Facebook can find the process slow, frustrating, and ineffective. Thus, we write to highlight positive steps that Facebook can take to strengthen its policies and practices. We hope to work with you to ensure that fewer individuals suffer online harassment and discrimination, and that it is quickly and effectively addressed when they do.
Based on our collective experience, we believe that Facebook should take additional actions including the following steps--many of which are highlighted in Facebook's recent Civil Rights Audit--to strengthen its commitment to civil rights and fighting disinformation and discrimination:
* Aggressively enforce Facebook policies against hate speech and organized hate organizations: Although Facebook has developed policies against hate speech and organizations that peddle it, we remain concerned that Facebook's policies on Dangerous Individuals and Organizations, including but not limited to its policies on white nationalist and white supremacist content, are not enforced quickly and comprehensively enough./9 Content that violates Facebook's own policies too often escapes removal just because it comes as coded language, rather than specific magic words. And even where Facebook takes steps to address a particular violation, it often fails to proactively address the follow-on actions by replacement or splinter groups that quickly emerge.
* Allow public, third-party audits of hate content and enforcement: To gauge the ongoing progress of Facebook's enforcement efforts, independent experts should be permitted access to the data necessary to conduct regular, transparent third-party audits of hate and hate-related misinformation on the platform, including any information made available to the Global Oversight Board. As part of this effort, Facebook should capture data on the prevalence of different forms of hate content on the platform, whether or not covered by Facebook's own community standards, thus allowing the public to determine whether enforcement of anti-hate policies differs based on the type of hate content at issue.
* Commit to an ongoing, independent analysis of Facebook's content population scheme and the prompt development of best practices guidance: By funneling users toward particular types of content, Facebook's content population scheme, including its algorithms, can push users into extremist online communities that feature divisive and inflammatory messages, often directed at particular groups. Although Facebook has conducted research and considered programs to reduce this risk, there is still no mandatory guidance for coders and other teams involved in content population. Facebook should commit to an ongoing, independent analysis of its content population scheme, including its algorithms, and also continuously implement mandatory protocols as best practices are identified to curb bias and prevent recommendations of hate content and groups.
* Expand policies limiting inflammatory advertisements that vilify minority groups: Although Facebook currently prohibits ads that claim that certain people, because of their membership in a protected group, pose a threat to the physical safety of communities or the nation, its policies still allow attacks that characterize such groups as threats to national culture or values.10 The current prohibition should be expanded to include such ads.
We also recommend the following measures to improve the supportive services that Facebook offers to users who have been or may become victims of harassment and intimidation on its platforms:
* Offer live real-time assistance: Facebook users can report intimidation and harassment but cannot immediately engage a Facebook employee who can promptly address issues that are occurring in real time. Victims of intimidation and harassment would benefit from more immediate access to Facebook employees who can offer prompt assistance. For example, if a user is being doxed, live assistance could help stop the spread of the user's personal information before the damage cannot be undone.
* Make information about harassment and intimidation more readily available: Facebook should facilitate evidence preservation and cooperate with victims and law enforcement agencies seeking evidence to prove a case of harassment or intimidation, such as cyberstalking or non-consensual distribution of intimate imagery, when the offenders use Facebook to perpetrate their crimes.
* Strengthen filtering, reporting, and blocking tools: Facebook allows users to block individual people, but users should have stronger tools and more choices for filtering out and reporting hateful, intimidating, and harassing content they do not want to see in their feeds. For example, if members of a Facebook group are engaged in an organized campaign of harassment against a single user, the victim should be able to block all members of the group and report batches of posts or users without having to block or report each individually.
We urge Facebook to take these steps to better tackle hate in our society, and address the interests of users who are victimized by others in the online community that Facebook has built.

* Aggressively enforce Facebook policies against hate speech and organized hate organizations: Although Facebook has developed policies against hate speech and organizations that peddle it, we remain concerned that Facebook's policies on Dangerous Individuals and Organizations, including but not limited to its policies on white nationalist and white supremacist content, are not enforced quickly and comprehensively enough./9 Content that violates Facebook's own policies too often escapes removal just because it comes as coded language, rather than specific magic words. And even where Facebook takes steps to address a particular violation, it often fails to proactively address the follow-on actions by replacement or splinter groups that quickly emerge.
* Allow public, third-party audits of hate content and enforcement: To gauge the ongoing progress of Facebook's enforcement efforts, independent experts should be permitted access to the data necessary to conduct regular, transparent third-party audits of hate and hate-related misinformation on the platform, including any information made available to the Global Oversight Board. As part of this effort, Facebook should capture data on the prevalence of different forms of hate content on the platform, whether or not covered by Facebook's own community standards, thus allowing the public to determine whether enforcement of anti-hate policies differs based on the type of hate content at issue.
* Commit to an ongoing, independent analysis of Facebook's content population scheme and the prompt development of best practices guidance: By funneling users toward particular types of content, Facebook's content population scheme, including its algorithms, can push users into extremist online communities that feature divisive and inflammatory messages, often directed at particular groups. Although Facebook has conducted research and considered programs to reduce this risk, there is still no mandatory guidance for coders and other teams involved in content population. Facebook should commit to an ongoing, independent analysis of its content population scheme, including its algorithms, and also continuously implement mandatory protocols as best practices are identified to curb bias and prevent recommendations of hate content and groups.
* Expand policies limiting inflammatory advertisements that vilify minority groups: Although Facebook currently prohibits ads that claim that certain people, because of their membership in a protected group, pose a threat to the physical safety of communities or the nation, its policies still allow attacks that characterize such groups as threats to national culture or values.10 The current prohibition should be expanded to include such ads.
We also recommend the following measures to improve the supportive services that Facebook offers to users who have been or may become victims of harassment and intimidation on its platforms:
* Offer live real-time assistance: Facebook users can report intimidation and harassment but cannot immediately engage a Facebook employee who can promptly address issues that are occurring in real time. Victims of intimidation and harassment would benefit from more immediate access to Facebook employees who can offer prompt assistance. For example, if a user is being doxed, live assistance could help stop the spread of the user's personal information before the damage cannot be undone.
* Make information about harassment and intimidation more readily available: Facebook should facilitate evidence preservation and cooperate with victims and law enforcement agencies seeking evidence to prove a case of harassment or intimidation, such as cyberstalking or non-consensual distribution of intimate imagery, when the offenders use Facebook to perpetrate their crimes.
* Strengthen filtering, reporting, and blocking tools: Facebook allows users to block individual people, but users should have stronger tools and more choices for filtering out and reporting hateful, intimidating, and harassing content they do not want to see in their feeds. For example, if members of a Facebook group are engaged in an organized campaign of harassment against a single user, the victim should be able to block all members of the group and report batches of posts or users without having to block or report each individually.
We urge Facebook to take these steps to better tackle hate in our society, and address the interests of users who are victimized by others in the online community that Facebook has built.

Becerra Calls on Facebook to Step Up Action to Combat the Spread of Hate and Disinformation Online,False,"California Attorney General Xavier Becerra issued the following news release on Aug. 5:
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra today joined a multistate letter calling on Facebook to take additional steps to combat the spread of hate and disinformation on the social media platform. The coalition also urges the company to do more to provide assistance to people who fall victim to online intimidation and harassment, including digital abuse and violence.
""When Facebook profits off of hate, it is letting its platform be used to dehumanize and demean,"" said Attorney General Becerra. ""The spread of hate and disinformation on social media puts our democracy and decades of advocacy work by Black Americans, Latinos, the LGBTQ community, people with disabilities, and many others at risk. If Facebook truly wants to be a place that brings people together, it must do more -- Mark Zuckerberg must do more. We urge Facebook to take affirmative steps to join us in the fight to better tackle hate in our society and disinformation in our democracy. It will take all of us working together to make a difference.""
Although Facebook has committed to the public and its users that it will ""invest billions of dollars each year to keep [Facebook's] community safe and continuously work with outside experts to review and update [Facebook's] policies,"" the recent independent civil rights audit of the company's policies and practices reveals that the steps taken thus far have fallen short. Private parties, organized groups, and public officials continue to use Facebook to spread misinformation and project messages of hate against different groups of Americans. According to recent surveys, more than forty percent of Americans have experienced some form of online harassment, including criminal forms of harassment like cyberstalking, doxing, and swatting. Of those Americans who report having been harassed online, more than three-quarters have reported being harassed on Facebook. Much of that harassment is focused on characteristics protected by the civil rights laws that state attorneys general are charged with enforcing, including race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender and gender identity, and disability. Unfortunately, recourse is unavailable for too many of these victims due to limitations on the services that Facebook offers victims.
In the letter, the Attorneys General urge Facebook to:
* Aggressively enforce the company's policies against hate speech and organized hate organizations;
* Allow public, third-party audits of hate content and enforcement;
* Commit to an ongoing, independent analysis of the platform's content population scheme and the prompt development of best practices guidance;
* Expand policies limiting inflammatory advertisements that vilify minority groups;
* Offer live real-time assistance to help users address harassment before damage becomes irreversible;
* Make information about unlawful harassment and intimidation more readily available, within the bounds of privacy laws, to victims and law enforcement; and
* Strengthen filtering, reporting, and blocking tools.
Attorney General Becerra is committed to combatting hate wherever it occurs. Last month, the Attorney General published the latest report on hate crime in California, which includes data through 2019. In June, he released a video urging Californians to stand united against hate and report suspected hate crimes to their local law enforcement agency. In April, the Attorney General issued a bulletin to help ensure law enforcement agencies across California have the necessary information and tools to continue to respond to hate crime activity during COVID-19. More information on tools and resources to combat hate crime is available at https://oag.ca.gov/hatecrimes.
In sending the letter, Attorney General Becerra joins the attorneys general of the District of Columbia, Illinois, New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin.

Mark Zuckerberg, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Sheryl Sandberg, Chief Operating Officer, Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, California 94025
Dear Mr. Zuckerberg & Ms. Sandberg:
We, the undersigned State Attorneys General, write to request that you take additional steps to prevent Facebook from being used to spread disinformation and hate and to facilitate discrimination. We also ask that you take more steps to provide redress for users who fall victim to intimidation and harassment, including violence and digital abuse.
Our nation is in the midst of a reckoning on issues of racial justice and civil rights. As State Attorneys General, we have witnessed firsthand how the country's longstanding undercurrent of discrimination has burst into the open, as reports of hate crimes and bias incidents of all kinds have dramatically increased in recent years./1 And while recent events have further highlighted the systemic injustice that persists in our society, the last few months also have seen millions of Americans join together to call for action against bias and racism.
As you know, Facebook is not immune to these problems. Although Facebook has made some progress in counteracting the use of its platform to dehumanize and demean, that is just the beginning of what is necessary./2 Private parties, organized groups, and public officials continue to use Facebook to spread misinformation and project messages of hate against different groups of Americans. In many cases, these messages lead to intimidation and harassment of particular individuals online.
According to recent surveys, more than forty percent of Americans have experienced some form of online harassment, including cyberstalking, doxing (maliciously publishing someone's personal information), and swatting (filing false police reports to prompt a law enforcement response targeting the victim)./3 Of those Americans who report having been harassed online, more than three-quarters have reported being harassed on Facebook./4 Much of that harassment is focused on characteristics protected by the civil rights laws that many of us are charged with enforcing, including race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender and gender identity, and disability./5 Recourse is unavailable for too many of these victims, due to limitations on the services that Facebook offers victims and other impediments to securing relief through civil lawsuits or criminal prosecutions.
We understand that Facebook has committed to the public and its users that it will ""invest billions of dollars each year to keep [Facebook's] community safe and continuously work with outside experts to review and update [Facebook's] policies.""/6 But, as the most recent Civil Rights Audit reveals, the steps you have taken thus far have fallen short. With the vast resources at your disposal, we believe there is much more that you can do to prevent the use of Facebook as a vehicle for misinformation and discrimination, and to prevent your users from being victimized by harassment and intimidation on your platforms.
As State Attorneys General, we are responsible for protecting the safety and wellbeing of all the communities we serve. As part of that mission, we must constantly contend with the impacts of online hate, intimidation, and harassment. Many of our offices enforce the laws that protect our residents from bias offenses, intimidation, and harassment--whether online or on our streets./7 And many of our offices include units dedicated to serving the victims of unlawful conduct, including helping them access and use tools that allow them to vindicate their rights. As part of our responsibilities to our communities, Attorneys General have helped residents navigate Facebook's processes for victims to address abuse on its platform. While Facebook has--on occasion--taken action to address violations of its terms of service in cases where we have helped elevate our constituents' concerns,/8 we know that everyday users of Facebook can find the process slow, frustrating, and ineffective. Thus, we write to highlight positive steps that Facebook can take to strengthen its policies and practices. We hope to work with you to ensure that fewer individuals suffer online harassment and discrimination, and that it is quickly and effectively addressed when they do.
Based on our collective experience, we believe that Facebook should take additional actions including the following steps--many of which are highlighted in Facebook's recent Civil Rights Audit--to strengthen its commitment to civil rights and fighting disinformation and discrimination:

43,/content/Bias_Incident_Lexis_1.DOCX,Targeted News Service,2020-08-06,2848 words,,Targeted News Service,,D.C. A.G. Racine Leads 20-State Coalition Urging Facebook to Aggressively Combat the Spread of Hate and Disinformation Online,False,"District of Columbia Attorney General Karl A. Racine issued the following news release on Aug. 5:
Attorney General Karl A. Racine, New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal, and Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul today co-led a coalition of 20 state Attorneys General calling on Facebook, Inc. (Facebook), to adopt additional preventive measures against the spread of hate and disinformation on its platform. In a letter to Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, the Attorneys General assert that ""[p]rivate parties, organized groups and public officials continue to use Facebook to spread misinformation and project messages of hate against different groups of Americans,"" leading to abuse of individual Facebook users. The letter cites the findings from Facebook's own internal audit indicating that the company has refused to enforce its own policies against dangerous organizations and individuals, including white supremacists and other extremists. In response, the Attorneys General urge Facebook to ""strengthen its commitment to civil rights and fighting disinformation and discrimination"" and to offer greater support for users who fall victim to online intimidation and harassment.
""Facebook has a responsibility to protect hundreds of thousands of District residents--and, indeed, millions of Americans--from hate and harassment while interacting on the company's online platforms,"" said AG Racine. ""Our coalition of state Attorneys General are calling on Facebook to not only meet the commitments it has already laid out for itself, but to step up its guard against the spread of extremism online.""
Facebook, headquartered in Menlo Park, California, is a digital social networking service with more than 2 billion active users around the world--including 250 million Americans, and hundreds of thousands of District residents. Through a website and a mobile application, Facebook allows users to communicate and share content with personalized networks of ""friends.""
Recent surveys suggest more than 40 percent of Americans have experienced some form of online harassment, and that of those victims, more than 75 percent have reported being harassed on Facebook. The Attorneys General observe in their letter that much of the harassment reported by Facebook users focuses on characteristics protected by civil rights laws, including race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender and gender identity, and disability. Such harassment can include cyberstalking, maliciously publishing someone's personal information, or filing false police reports targeting the victim. The letter contends that at present, ""recourse is unavailable for too many of these victims,"" due to factors including insufficient, limited services offered to victims by Facebook.
The Attorneys General acknowledge that ""Facebook has--on occasion--taken action to address violations of its terms of service in cases where we have helped elevate our constituents' concerns."" But they further emphasize that many Facebook users continue to find the redress process ""slow, frustrating, and ineffective.""
Recommendations for Facebook
The reforms recommended in today's letter, many of which are highlighted in the company's recent civil rights audit, include calls for Facebook to:
Aggressively enforce policies against hate speech and extremist organizations: The audit found that while Facebook already has policies on the books to prevent the spread of hate speech, the company neglects to fully enforce these policies. The Attorneys General call on the company to follow through on its commitment to uphold its policies. Further, the Attorneys General urge the company to expand its policies in order to limit inflammatory advertisements that vilify minority groups.
Allow public, third-party audits of hate content and enforcement to guide best practices: The Attorneys General recommend the company open itself up to additional audit efforts, in the vein of the civil rights audit. Further, they advise the company to accept ongoing, independent analysis of the platform's content population scheme, and follow suggested best practices determined from these efforts.
Enhance supportive services for users targeted by hateful or harassing content: The Attorneys General encourage Facebook to offer live, real-time assistance to victims of intimidation and harassment on the platform, make information about unlawful harassment and intimidation more readily available to users, and strengthen users' ability to filter, report, and block malicious content.
AG Racine co-led this letter with New Jersey Attorney General Grewal and Illinois Attorney General Raoul. They were joined by the Attorneys General of California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, Vermont and Wisconsin.

We urge Facebook to take these steps to better tackle hate in our society, and address the interests of users who are victimized by others in the online community that Facebook has built.

Herring Calls on Facebook to Take Stronger Steps to Prevent Use of Its Platforms to Spread Hate and Disinformation,False,"Virginia Attorney General Mark R. Herring issued the following news release on Aug. 5:
Attorney General Mark R. Herring today joined 19 attorneys general from across the United States in calling on Facebook to take additional steps to prevent the popular social media website from being used to spread hate and disinformation. Attorney General Herring and his colleagues also urged Facebook to provide stronger support for users who fall victim to online intimidation and harassment on its platforms.
In a letter sent today to Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, Attorney General Herring and his colleagues assert that despite its stated commitment to working to keep its user community safe, Facebook has fallen short in keeping hate content off its platforms and protecting users from online harassment.
""Unfortunately, over the past few years, we have seen how Facebook can be used as a tool to spread misinformation and hate that can have serious, real-life consequences,"" said Attorney General Herring. ""Especially now, when our country finds itself in a moment of tremendous social change and with an incredibly important presidential election in just a few months, Facebook must take stronger steps to further protect its users from hate and prevent its platform from being used to spread disinformation.""
The coalition's letter highlights that the nation is presently in a moment of reckoning on issues of racial justice and civil rights. Against this backdrop, the letter states that ""[p]rivate parties, organized groups and public officials continue to use Facebook to spread misinformation and project messages of hate against different groups of Americans,"" with many of those messages leading to the abuse of individual Facebook users.
The letter follows the release of a Civil Rights Audit of Facebook's practices - commissioned by the company and completed in July - that faults Facebook for failing to advance civil rights, and refusing to enforce its own policies against dangerous organizations and individuals, including white supremacists and other extremists.
Recent surveys suggest more than 40 percent of Americans have experienced some form of online harassment, and that of those victims, more than 75 percent have reported being harassed on Facebook. The letter urges Facebook to implement several reforms recommended in the Civil Rights Audit to ""strengthen its commitment to civil rights and fighting disinformation and discrimination."" It further recommends steps designed to improve Facebook's supportive services for victims.
According to today's letter, much of the harassment reported by Facebook users focuses on characteristics protected by civil rights laws, including race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender and gender identity, and disability.
Such harassment can include conduct like cyberstalking, doxing (maliciously publishing someone's personal information), and swatting (filing false police reports to prompt law enforcement response targeting the victim.) The letter contends that at present, ""recourse is unavailable for too many of these victims,"" due to limitations on the services that Facebook offers victims, as well as other factors.
The Attorneys General acknowledge that ""Facebook has--on occasion--taken action to address violations of its terms of service in cases where we have helped elevate our constituents' concerns."" But the letter adds that many Facebook users continue to find the redress process ""slow, frustrating, and ineffective.""
The reforms recommended in today's letter, many of which are highlighted in the recent Civil Rights Audit, include calls for Facebook to:
* Aggressively enforce its policies against hate speech and organized hate organizations;
* Allow public, third-party audits of hate content and enforcement;
* Commit to an ongoing, independent analysis of Facebook's content population scheme and the prompt development of best practices guidance; and
* Expand policies limiting inflammatory advertisements that vilify minority groups;
The Attorneys General also recommends steps to enhance Facebook supportive services including:
* Offer live real-time assistance to victims of intimidation and harassment;
* Make information about unlawful harassment and intimidation more readily available; and
* Strengthen filtering, reporting, and blocking tools.
Joining Attorney General Herring in sending today's letter are the attorneys general of California, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin.

Mark Zuckerberg, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Sheryl Sandberg, Chief Operating Officer, Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, California 94025
Dear Mr. Zuckerberg & Ms. Sandberg:
We, the undersigned State Attorneys General, write to request that you take additional steps to prevent Facebook from being used to spread disinformation and hate and to facilitate discrimination. We also ask that you take more steps to provide redress for users who fall victim to intimidation and harassment, including violence and digital abuse.
Our nation is in the midst of a reckoning on issues of racial justice and civil rights. As State Attorneys General, we have witnessed firsthand how the country's longstanding undercurrent of discrimination has burst into the open, as reports of hate crimes and bias incidents of all kinds have dramatically increased in recent years./1 And while recent events have further highlighted the systemic injustice that persists in our society, the last few months also have seen millions of Americans join together to call for action against bias and racism.
As you know, Facebook is not immune to these problems. Although Facebook has made some progress in counteracting the use of its platform to dehumanize and demean, that is just the beginning of what is necessary./2 Private parties, organized groups, and public officials continue to use Facebook to spread misinformation and project messages of hate against different groups of Americans. In many cases, these messages lead to intimidation and harassment of particular individuals online.
According to recent surveys, more than forty percent of Americans have experienced some form of online harassment, including cyberstalking, doxing (maliciously publishing someone's personal information), and swatting (filing false police reports to prompt a law enforcement response targeting the victim)./3 Of those Americans who report having been harassed online, more than three-quarters have reported being harassed on Facebook./4 Much of that harassment is focused on characteristics protected by the civil rights laws that many of us are charged with enforcing, including race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender and gender identity, and disability./5 Recourse is unavailable for too many of these victims, due to limitations on the services that Facebook offers victims and other impediments to securing relief through civil lawsuits or criminal prosecutions.
We understand that Facebook has committed to the public and its users that it will ""invest billions of dollars each year to keep [Facebook's] community safe and continuously work with outside experts to review and update [Facebook's] policies.""/6 But, as the most recent Civil Rights Audit reveals, the steps you have taken thus far have fallen short. With the vast resources at your disposal, we believe there is much more that you can do to prevent the use of Facebook as a vehicle for misinformation and discrimination, and to prevent your users from being victimized by harassment and intimidation on your platforms.
As State Attorneys General, we are responsible for protecting the safety and wellbeing of all the communities we serve. As part of that mission, we must constantly contend with the impacts of online hate, intimidation, and harassment. Many of our offices enforce the laws that protect our residents from bias offenses, intimidation, and harassment--whether online or on our streets./7 And many of our offices include units dedicated to serving the victims of unlawful conduct, including helping them access and use tools that allow them to vindicate their rights. As part of our responsibilities to our communities, Attorneys General have helped residents navigate Facebook's processes for victims to address abuse on its platform. While Facebook has--on occasion--taken action to address violations of its terms of service in cases where we have helped elevate our constituents' concerns,/8 we know that everyday users of Facebook can find the process slow, frustrating, and ineffective. Thus, we write to highlight positive steps that Facebook can take to strengthen its policies and practices. We hope to work with you to ensure that fewer individuals suffer online harassment and discrimination, and that it is quickly and effectively addressed when they do.
Based on our collective experience, we believe that Facebook should take additional actions including the following steps--many of which are highlighted in Facebook's recent Civil Rights Audit--to strengthen its commitment to civil rights and fighting disinformation and discrimination:
* Aggressively enforce Facebook policies against hate speech and organized hate organizations: Although Facebook has developed policies against hate speech and organizations that peddle it, we remain concerned that Facebook's policies on Dangerous Individuals and Organizations, including but not limited to its policies on white nationalist and white supremacist content, are not enforced quickly and comprehensively enough./9 Content that violates Facebook's own policies too often escapes removal just because it comes as coded language, rather than specific magic words. And even where Facebook takes steps to address a particular violation, it often fails to proactively address the follow-on actions by replacement or splinter groups that quickly emerge.
* Allow public, third-party audits of hate content and enforcement: To gauge the ongoing progress of Facebook's enforcement efforts, independent experts should be permitted access to the data necessary to conduct regular, transparent third-party audits of hate and hate-related misinformation on the platform, including any information made available to the Global Oversight Board. As part of this effort, Facebook should capture data on the prevalence of different forms of hate content on the platform, whether or not covered by Facebook's own community standards, thus allowing the public to determine whether enforcement of anti-hate policies differs based on the type of hate content at issue.
* Commit to an ongoing, independent analysis of Facebook's content population scheme and the prompt development of best practices guidance: By funneling users toward particular types of content, Facebook's content population scheme, including its algorithms, can push users into extremist online communities that feature divisive and inflammatory messages, often directed at particular groups. Although Facebook has conducted research and considered programs to reduce this risk, there is still no mandatory guidance for coders and other teams involved in content population. Facebook should commit to an ongoing, independent analysis of its content population scheme, including its algorithms, and also continuously implement mandatory protocols as best practices are identified to curb bias and prevent recommendations of hate content and groups.
* Expand policies limiting inflammatory advertisements that vilify minority groups: Although Facebook currently prohibits ads that claim that certain people, because of their membership in a protected group, pose a threat to the physical safety of communities or the nation, its policies still allow attacks that characterize such groups as threats to national culture or values.10 The current prohibition should be expanded to include such ads.
We also recommend the following measures to improve the supportive services that Facebook offers to users who have been or may become victims of harassment and intimidation on its platforms:
* Offer live real-time assistance: Facebook users can report intimidation and harassment but cannot immediately engage a Facebook employee who can promptly address issues that are occurring in real time. Victims of intimidation and harassment would benefit from more immediate access to Facebook employees who can offer prompt assistance. For example, if a user is being doxed, live assistance could help stop the spread of the user's personal information before the damage cannot be undone.
* Make information about harassment and intimidation more readily available: Facebook should facilitate evidence preservation and cooperate with victims and law enforcement agencies seeking evidence to prove a case of harassment or intimidation, such as cyberstalking or non-consensual distribution of intimate imagery, when the offenders use Facebook to perpetrate their crimes.
* Strengthen filtering, reporting, and blocking tools: Facebook allows users to block individual people, but users should have stronger tools and more choices for filtering out and reporting hateful, intimidating, and harassing content they do not want to see in their feeds. For example, if members of a Facebook group are engaged in an organized campaign of harassment against a single user, the victim should be able to block all members of the group and report batches of posts or users without having to block or report each individually.
We urge Facebook to take these steps to better tackle hate in our society, and address the interests of users who are victimized by others in the online community that Facebook has built.

45,/content/Bias_Incident_Lexis_1.DOCX,States News Service,2020-12-23,738 words,,States News Service,,ANTISEMITISM IS ON THE RISE IN MICHIGAN. ALL OF US CAN FIGHT IT.,False,"The following information was released by the American Jewish Committee (AJC):
By Rabbi Asher Lopatin and Lauren Herrin
Hate is ever present in our society. We have all seen it on television, social media, flyers and banners, as well as through abhorrent actions such as assault and murder. High profile incidents make the news. But many may not realize that these hate-fueled acts are happening far more than we think, and at an increasing pace.
Recently, the FBI released ""Hate Crime Statistics, 2019,"" an annual report of bias-motivated incidents throughout the United States.
The data, submitted by more than 15,500 law enforcement agencies, provides information about the offenses, victims, offenders and locations of hate crime incidents. But since reporting is not mandatory, it is likely that the numbers are actually higher.
This year's report is especially worrying to American Jews.
Of the 1,715 religious-based incidents, 60.2% targeted Jews, who make up less than 2% of the country's population. This is four-and-a-half times more than hate crimes committed against the next most-targeted community, those of the Muslim faith, at 13.2%. The report also showed that hate incidents targeting Jews were up 14% compared to the prior year.
Of the total incidents reported in the category, 51 occurred in Michigan and, thankfully, were nonviolent. While this number may seem relatively low, it is five times more than we would expect based on the percentage of Jews who live in Michigan, 1% of the state's population.
The FBI data may not be shocking to some. As Jews, we have watched in horror as marchers with tiki torches spewed hate in Charlottesville in 2017. We wept upon learning of the senseless massacres in Pittsburgh in 2018, and in Poway, Calif.; Jersey City, New Jersey; and Monsey, New York, in 2019.
In Michigan, Jews have seen hateful flyers posted on the gates of cemeteries and in local cities. Last year, a Nazi flag was found flying at an elementary school in Battle Creek.
As the FBI's statistics bear out, antisemitism is thriving.
On the second commemoration of the Tree of Life shooting in late October, American Jewish Committee, of which our organization, Jewish Community Relations Council/AJC, is a regional office, issued its State of Antisemitism in America 2020: Survey of American Jews and Survey of the General Public. Among its many other findings, 88% of Jews found antisemitism to be a problem in the United States today, but only 62% of the general public agreed. More awareness and education are necessary.
What can we do to curb these frightening numbers against not only Jews, but all groups facing hate?
The first step is to report hate crimes. Make the proper authorities police, FBI and community organizations aware. This will help not only catch the perpetrator, but also will help keep such incidents from happening in the future by making sure they are properly listed as acts of hate.
Second, specifically regarding acts of hate against Jews and the Jewish community, is to better understand what antisemitism means. JCRC/AJC, along with other organizations across the country and around the world, are working with local, state and national bodies to recognize the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance Working Definition of Antisemitism, which includes important illustrations of how antisemitism manifests.
Next, advocate against hate by urging the U.S. Senate to pass the Jabara-Heyer National Opposition to Hate, Assaults and Threats to Equality, or NO HATE, Act before the approaching end of this congressional session.
This legislation will, among other things, incentivize state and local law enforcement authorities to improve hate crime reporting by making grants available for resources such as reporting hotlines and law enforcement training. Please become a voice against hate, and feel free to contact JCRC/AJC with your own ideas on how to fight this growing scourge in our community.
Finally, come together in alliances with different communities to hear each other's experiences with hate and discrimination. This will help your understanding of your ally's particular fear of the hate they are experiencing, such as antisemitism.
If everyone works together, perhaps the numbers reported for 2021 and beyond will show a downward trend.

MINNEAPOLIS - Minneapolis police union president Bob Kroll called the bystander video of the death of George Floyd ""horrific"" while cautioning the public not to rush to judgment.
The union has been mostly silent about Floyd's death since issuing a statement soon after he died on May 25 after a police officer kneeled on his neck for nearly eight minutes. Kroll said Tuesday on ""CBS This Morning"" he thinks union members are being scapegoated for incompetent department leadership.
Kroll says the union has been denied its right to review officer body-camera video. Union director Rich Walker says ""any human being"" watching the video knows Floyd's arrest ""should not have ended the way it did."" But Walker questioned statements that Floyd didn't resist officers because the union hasn't seen footage of the minutes leading up to the bystander video showed.
Police chief Medaria Arradondo said after Floyd's death that he's pausing contract negotiations with the union to consider major changes. Anna Hedberg, another union director, says the union had been having ""great conversations"" with city leaders and Arradondo before Floyd's death.
She says it's ""dumbfounding to me that one incident, we become the scapegoat to having a bad officer.""
Ex-officer Derek Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder. Three other officers at the scene are charged with aiding and abetting.

WASHINGTON - Americans overwhelmingly want clear standards for police on when officers may use force and consequences imposed on officers who do so excessively.
That's according to a new poll from the The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research that finds Americans favor significant changes to the country's criminal justice system. Americans are largely united behind the idea that action is required: 40% say it needs ""major changes;"" 29% think the criminal justice system needs ""a complete overhaul"" and 25% say it needs ""minor changes."" Just 5% believe no changes are necessary.
The poll also finds there is strong support for penalizing officers who engage in racially biased policing. Americans are more likely now than five years ago to say that police violence against the public is a very serious problem and that officers who cause injury or death on the job are treated too leniently.
The survey of American adults took place after weeks of mass demonstrations against police violence and calls from some politicians and activists to ""defund"" police departments in response to the death of George Floyd.
---
DES MOINES, Iowa -The Des Moines City Council unanimously approved an anti-racial profiling ordinance that prohibits biased policing and requires city employees to report violations by officers.
Some supporters say the vote Monday night was only a first step and officials need to take additional actions.
The ordinance prohibits discriminatory pretextual stops, in which drivers are stopped for one infraction but charged with a different infraction. Many residents who spoke before the council voted wanted all pretextual stops banned.
The ordinance also mandates additional officer training, requires city employees to report incidents of biased policing they witness and creates a board with community members that helps the city manager review data and make policy recommendations.
Daniel Zeno, policy and advocacy director at the American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa, says passage of the measure was a good step. He'd also like to see a citizen oversight committee.
For years, advocates have been calling for the council to approve such an ordinance. Officials began working on the new rules following protests of George Floyd's death at the hands of police in Minneapolis.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. - Authorities in North Carolina say a shooting at an impromptu block party has left two people dead and seven others wounded.
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Deputy Chief Johnny Jennings told reporters early Monday the shooting happened around midnight at a block party that was a continuation of Juneteenth celebrations. Jennings said police responding to a pedestrian call found hundreds of people in the streets.
After authorities arrived, several shots were fired and the crowd scattered. Jennings said five people were hit by cars while running away from the shooting. He said there was evidence of multiple shooters.
Further details weren't immediately available.

SEATTLE - Police in Seattle say one person has been wounded in the second shooting in Seattle's protest zone in less than 48 hours.
The shooting happened late Sunday night in the area near Seattle's downtown area known as CHOP, for ""Capitol Hill Occupied Protest."" Police tweeted that one person was at a hospital with a gunshot wound. A hospital spokesperson says the person was in serious condition.
A pre-dawn shooting Saturday had left a 19-year-old man dead and another person critically injured. No arrests in that shooting had been made as of Sunday.
The CHOP zone is a several-block area cordoned off by protesters near a police station in the city's Capitol Hill neighborhood that evolved after weeks of protests in the city over police brutality and racism, sparked by the police killing of George Floyd, a Black man, in Minneapolis.
--
NEW YORK - A New York City police officer was suspended without pay Sunday after he was recorded putting his arm around a man's neck in what the police commissioner called an ""apparent chokehold.""
The department's action to suspend the officer was stunning in its swiftness, occurring just hours after the morning confrontation on a beach boardwalk in the Rockaway section of Queens.
A video shot by one of the men involved showed a group of officers tackling a Black man, with one of them putting his arm around his neck as he lay face-down on the boardwalk.
In the video, someone yells, ""Stop choking him, bro!"" The officer relaxes his grip after a fellow officer taps him and pulls on his shirt.
It was unclear whether the man who was tackled suffered more than superficial injuries. He stood under his own power after he got off the ground and refused to let medics examine him after the incident.
The NYPD has long banned chokeholds. Their use has been especially fraught since the 2014 death of Eric Garner after an officer put him in a chokehold while trying to arrest him.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo recently signed into law a sweeping package of police accountability measures including a ban on chokeholds following protests over George Floyd's killing.

GARDENA, Calif. - Two Democratic lawmakers called Sunday for California's Attorney General to investigate the fatal shooting of a young man by a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy. Reps. Maxine Waters and Nanette Diaz Barragán said in a statement there's a need for an independent investigation into the death of 18-year-old Andres Guardado so the public will trust the findings.
Messages seeking comment were sent to the state Attorney General's office and the Los Angeles County sheriff's department. Guardado was shot Thursday after Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies spotted him with a gun in front of a business near Gardena. Several hundred people gathered Sunday to protest the shooting.

NEW YORK - The American Museum of Natural History will remove a prominent statue of Theodore Roosevelt from its entrance after years of objections that it symbolizes colonial expansion and racial discrimination, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Sunday.
The bronze statue that has stood at the museum's Central Park West entrance since 1940 depicts Roosevelt on horseback with a Native American man and an African man standing next to the horse.
""The American Museum of Natural History has asked to remove the Theodore Roosevelt statue because it explicitly depicts Black and Indigenous people as subjugated and racially inferior,"" de Blasio said in a written statement. ""The City supports the Museum's request. It is the right decision and the right time to remove this problematic statue.""
The museum's president, Ellen Futter, told the New York Times that the museum's ""community has been profoundly moved by the ever-widening movement for racial justice that has emerged after the killing of George Floyd.""

SEATTLE - Seattle police on Sunday pursued their investigation into a weekend shooting in a park in the city's protest zone that killed a 19-year-old man and critically injured another person.
No arrests had been made.
An ""active and ongoing"" investigation was under way into the shooting, which occurred about 2:30 a.m. Saturday in an area near downtown known as CHOP, for ""Capitol Hill Occupied Protest"" zone, said Detective Mark Jamieson. The suspect or suspects fled the scene, and police asked the public for any information that could identify them.
The zone evolved after weeks of protests in the city over police brutality and racism following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
Officers responding to the shooting said they had trouble getting to the scene because they were ""were met by a violent crowd that prevented officers safe access to the victims,"" according to a police blog.
Video released later Saturday by police appears to show officers arriving at the protest zone saying they want to get to the victim and entering as people yell at them that the victim is already gone. Police mostly retreated from the zone after clashes with protesters, KIRO-TV reported.
Private vehicles took two males with gunshot wounds to Harborview Medical Center, where the 19-year-old man died. A 33-year-old man, whose name was not immediately released, remained in critical condition Sunday, hospital spokeswoman Susan Gregg told KOMO-TV.

Deseret News
When Facebook on Wednesday said it would ""temporarily reduce distribution"" of an article that could potentially damage Joe Biden's campaign, conservatives who have long sought to prove that the company is biased against them thought they'd found not just a smoking gun, but a five-alarm blaze.
Facebook said that a New York Post article about the Democratic presidential nominee and son Hunter Biden's dealings with Ukraine required fact-checking in accordance with new policies designed to stop the spread of misinformation. 
But Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley, among other Facebook critics, said the restriction was blatant censorship. 
""This is BigTech control of news and speech, nationwide, in real time - all in an attempt to control an election,"" Hawley tweeted. 
Fox News host Tucker Carlson also recently accused Facebook of bias after the company flagged a video about the origins of COVID-19 as misinformation.
And yet Democrats and liberals accuse the company of being too accommodating to conservatives. For example, Facebook employees were so unhappy with the company's decision to let controversial posts from President Donald Trump stay up that they staged a virtual walkout in June.
The company's attempts to satisfy Americans on both sides of the political divide, including establishing a global oversight board, have done little to calm a volatile debate that rages most loudly among conservatives. Pew Research Center reported in August that 90% of Republicans believe it's very or somewhat likely that social media companies censor views they don't like, compared to 59% of Democrats.
But social media observers note that charges of discrimination against conservatives are countered by a curious fact: The most read posts on Facebook each day are overwhelmingly from conservative sources.
So why is the relationship between conservatives and Facebook so fraught, and what, if anything, can be done to fix it?
Drizzle to a downpour
Kevin Roose, a technology columnist for The New York Times, tracks Facebook's 10 most popular posts each day and posts them on Twitter. On Wednesday, even as conservative lawmakers were tweeting about censorship, the top 10 on Facebook were from President Donald Trump, conservative commentator Don Bongino and Fox News.
The domination of the platform by conservatives is normal, Roose says.
""Most days, the leader board looks roughly the same: conservative post after conservative post, with the occasional liberal interloper,"" he wrote recently. Roose believes that the suspected ""silent majority"" of support for Trump is evident on Facebook, because what people ""read, watch, and click on when nobody's looking"" is a better indicator of support than polls or interviews.
""Pro-Trump political influencers have spent years building a well-oiled media machine that swarms around every major news story, creating a torrent of viral commentary that reliably drowns out both the mainstream media and the liberal opposition,"" Roose wrote.
Some of that content, however, is removed by Facebook. For example, earlier this month, Facebook said it shut down 276 fake accounts that were promoting conservative positions. Facebook said the accounts did not belong to real people but were set up by an Arizona digital communications firm in violation of its community standards. The social media giant has also recently cracked down on pages that promote the group QAnon.
Steven Levy, editor at large for Wired magazine and author of ""Facebook, the Inside Story,"" said the performance of conservative content on Facebook isn't proof that the complaints about Facebook are wrong. But, he said, ""it's a data point that shows conservative content not only can circulate on Facebook, but that it circulates with more velocity generally than stuff from the left or stuff from the middle.""
That doesn't placate Dan Gainor, vice president of TechWatch at the Reston, Virginia-based Media Research Center, who believes that Facebook and other tech companies began to actively discriminate against conservatives after Trump's election. Before the election, Gainor said, there were occasional complaints about bias; after the election, ""it went from a drizzle to a downpour to the internet version of a hurricane.""
""People discovered that conservatives were online, and they weren't just online by 10s or 20s, they were online by tens of millions. And so everything that's been done by the Big Tech companies since then has been an attempt to prevent 2016 from ever happening again,"" Gainor said.
Restricting the sharing of an article seen as damaging to the Biden campaign seems evidence to many conservatives, including talk-show host Mark Levin, that Facebook and Twitter are aligned with Democrats. Levin even said that the action amounted to ""an in-kind contribution"" to the Biden campaign. (By Thursday, the restrictions appeared to have been lifted; a reporter for the Deseret News was able to share the article on Facebook - and then delete it - without the post being flagged.)
In a statement provided to the Deseret News, a Facebook spokesman said, ""While many Republicans think we should take one course, many Democrats think we should do the exact opposite. We've faced criticism from Republicans for being biased against conservatives and Democrats for not taking more steps to restrict the exact same content. We have rules in place to protect the integrity of the election and free expression, and we will continue to apply them impartially."" 
Looking for proof
Proving bias on social media is difficult, Gainor said, but that doesn't stop him from trying. He also runs a new website called CensorTrack.org that publishes information on individuals and websites that claim they have been unfairly treated by social media.
Cases currently listed on the site include the Catholic Speakers Organization, which says that Facebook has blocked ads for a livestream called ""Election Truth Hour"" and a Facebook video on California wildfires, by journalist John Stossel, labeled as misleading.
Gainor says that bias is evident not only in what Facebook shuts down, but in what the company leaves up. He pointed to the company's recent crackdown on QAnon, but said that Facebook has not been similarly tough on antifa. He also said the company would not intervene when someone posted South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham's home address and encouraged protesters to gather there last month.
Rob Bluey, vice president for communications for the Heritage Foundation, said the conservative think tank and its news organization, The Daily Signal, have had problems with posts being flagged on Facebook and other forms of social media.
""The problem is, can you document it? One of the things I think conservatives haven't done well at is providing a comprehensive database of incidents,"" he said.
""I know there are complaints on the Left as well, but it seems to me, conservatives frequently find themselves in a position where they're seeing their content removed or restricted, and it is concerning,"" Bluey said.
But Levy, of Wired magazine, said there is ""no evidence whatsoever"" that Facebook and other tech companies are writing code to sniff out conservative content so that it can be censored or limited.
""The reason why conservatives are unhappy is that more misinformation circulates from the right and some of it violates Facebook's policy and gets taken down,"" he said. Levy believes that ongoing complaints about bias is a conservative strategy to keep the heat on Facebook so the company will be more hesitant to remove their content.
""They're trying to game the system so Facebook keeps hands off some of the most toxic, damaging, policy-breaking information that might come from the Right.""
A neutral platform?
In a recent article in The Verge, writer Casey Newton described Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg as a man in the middle, struggling to deal with complaints of conservative users and policymakers while maintaining the loyalty of employees who hold different world views.
In one recording obtained by The Verge, Zuckerberg said to employees, ""the community we serve tends to be, on average, ideologically a little bit more conservative than our employee base."" He then added, ""Maybe 'little' is an understatement.""
In another, Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, said she has ""a very strong point of view on this president,"" but said that view should not enter into her decisions at the company. ""We have to be a neutral platform and make those decisions coming from a place of rules and principles.""
In response to conservatives' mounting complaints, Zuckerberg asked former Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl to look into alleged incidents of bias. While not definitive, the report said that ""Facebook's policies and their application have the potential to restrict free expression.""
In an interview with Bluey about the report for The Daily Signal, Kyl said that Facebook officials acknowledged that perception of bias is a problem even when bias does not exist. Kyl said he has ""talked to people at the highest levels of the company, and they have the very best of intentions.""
The political ideology of Zuckerberg is a source of speculation, but The Wall Street Journal has reported that he is registered to vote in Santa Clara County, California, without designated a political party. Prior to 2014, he made contributions to both Demo- crats and Republicans, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and former Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah.
Zuckerberg said in 2016 that he is neither Republican nor Democrat, but ""pro-knowledge economy.""
A reported private meeting with Trump last year could mean affinity for the president - or that he's a shrewd businessman trying to keep Section 230 intact.
Section 230 is the portion of the 1996 Communications Decency Act that protects third-party publishers such as Facebook from liability for either allowing content to stay on the platforms, or taking it down.
Trump, who believes he is being treated unfairly by Twitter, has tweeted that he wants Congress to repeal Section 230.
Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah has defended the measure, saying its removal would present problems for smaller companies who don't have Big Tech's legal resources and need the law's ""Good Samaritan"" clause, which protects them from legal action when they remove objectionable material.
""This is what makes it possible for all of us to visit YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter without being inundated with obscene content,"" Lee wrote on his Senate website in September 2019.
But Lee's spokesman, Conn Carroll, said the senator ""does not believe it is perfect,"" and he is among legislators demanding to know more about how Facebook and Twitter operate. In a recent letter to the CEOs of Facebook and Twitter, among other tech companies, Lee asked for clarification on their content removal policies, saying that prominent conservative voices have been ""deplatformed, demonetized, or otherwise penalized for expressing their opinions.""
A 'great distribution platform'
So why do conservatives keep using Facebook if they believe the company is actively working against them?
Bluey of the Heritage Foundation said that conservatives turned to Facebook initially because they believed they were discriminated against by influential newspapers such as The New York Times and The Washington Post.
""Facebook, in many ways, is a great distribution platform. You don't have to look any farther than the president himself. There are a tremendous number of conservatives having success on the platform,"" he said. ""But I think there are times when they also encounter challenges.""
He credits Facebook for meeting with conservatives and consulting them on policy changes. ""They don't always take our advice, but they do at least listen to what we have to say,"" Bluey said.
In fact, some Facebook employees have complained that conservatives are having too much say in the company, especially with the hiring of Joel Kaplan as Facebook's vice president of global public policy. He is a former policy adviser and deputy chief of staff to President George W. Bush and is a friend of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
Gainor, at the Media Research Center, said the nonprofit has a Facebook presence and has more than 13 million followers. ""Why is that?"" he asked. ""Because we devoted a lot of energy, effort and money to build our support. It's the reason why we have huge engagement ... because we offer something different.""
It's also because Facebook has 2.7 billion customers, he said.
""Let's say there are about 100 million conservatives using Facebook in America. Facebook wouldn't want to lose them, but Facebook could survive pretty easily. Meanwhile, conservatives would lose their ability not only to communicate with their family and friends, but also their ability to share their message across the platform,"" he said. ""You would put the conservative movement in a ghetto. Which is what they want to do.""
Gainor said there's a simple solution that Big Tech could employ to end the debate.
""Prove it. Prove to us it's not true. If they want to claim they're neutral players, then their algorithms have to be public,"" he said.
But even that might not work. Levy, at Wired magazine, said that even if the companies agreed to do that, ""Making an algorithm public makes it easier for bad actors to game the system,"" he said.

The present study examines the prevalence and impact of victimization among a sample of Roma individuals in Malmö and Gothenburg (Sweden). The aim of the study was to examine the link between visibility and victimization, and whether the Roma community employs behavioural strategies to reduce visibility, and, finally, to analyse how such strategies affect the group. The study design combines survey data (n=610) with interviews (n=30). The findings suggest that visibility is an important risk factor for victimization and that the study participants’ attempt to conceal their ethnicity affects them negatively both at an individual and a community level. The discussion concludes by presenting a number of policy implications.
FULL TEXT
Introduction
This study describes the prevalence of victimization and its impact among a sample of the Roma minority in a Swedish context. In this study, the term ‘Roma’ is used as an umbrella term and refers to many ethnic minority groups that share a nomadic history, including the Roma, Travellers (in Swedish: Resandefolket), and others. It is estimated that there are up to 12 million Roma living in Europe and about 50,000 Roma living in Sweden (SOU, 2010: 55). Although this group cannot be defined as a single homogenous group, they face a number of shared challenges including exposure to discrimination and victimization.
In Sweden, the Roma have been subject to several officially recognized human rights violations during different ages (Westin et al., 2014). Furthermore, researchers have noted that the Roma constitute a vulnerable group in relation to victimization (Hall et al., 2014). Swedish official statistics estimate the number of anti-Roma-motivated hate crimes (or bias crimes) reported to the police in the year 2018 as approximately 160 cases, which is the lowest number of reported anti-Roma crimes since crimes with an anti-Roma motive started being registered as separate offences in the year 2008 (National Council for Crime Prevention [BRÅ], 2018). However, these official statistics are associated with several problems. There is a consensus among researchers with a focus on bias victimization that a significant amount of criminal activity is not officially recorded. In general, the Roma have a low propensity to report crimes to the police (Wallengren and Mellgren, 2018). It should also be noted that, in Sweden, there are no official data regarding the Roma community’s exposure to non-bias crimes, which makes it difficult to get a clear picture of the group’s victimization experiences. Few self-report studies concerning the Roma community’s victimization experiences have been conducted. According to one study by Wallengren and Mellgren (2015a), of a sample of 121 Roma living in the Gothenburg region of Sweden, 46% of the respondents reported having experienced at least one type of victimization during the last 12 months and one-fifth of the respondents had experienced anti-Roma-motivated victimization. As many as 84% stated that they had been the victims of an anti-Roma-motivated crime at some point during their lifetime. The study also found a tendency towards a higher degree of victimization among those respondents who were open about their ethnicity.
Even though researching a vulnerable population like the Roma presents numerous methodological challenges, there are many reasons for analysing the group’s victimization experiences. Firstly, the gathering of victimization data is essential in determining the extent of a group’s social problems and for the development of prevention strategies. Secondly, the vulnerable populations themselves may use such data to increase their empowerment, to point out their difficulties, and for lobbying, so that politicians (and others) are forced to acknowledge their experiences. Lastly, it is also possible that the research production in itself has a positive effect on the relationship between the majority society and the population. As often highlighted, the crimes that these vulnerable populations suffer are frequently perceived as a ‘message’– implying that the vulnerable populations are not full members of society and should ‘know their place’ (Perry, 2001). By producing research that highlights vulnerable populations’ suffering, society offers a counter message. It sends a signal that the specific group’s voices are of importance and that the group should be acknowledged as well as helped and protected.
The present study will contribute to this largely underexplored research field by reporting the victimization experiences of individuals who belong to the Roma minority in Malmö and Gothenburg, two of Sweden’s largest cities. A questionnaire was distributed and in-depth interviews were conducted to examine how visibility, i.e. the perception of the minority as being different from mainstream society, is related to victimization. In particular, we want to (a) investigate how visibility is related to the risk of victimization; (b) investigate whether study participants employ behavioural strategies to conceal group belonging as a means of reducing their victimization risk; and, finally, (c) analyse how these behavioural strategies affect the group.
Previous research and the study’s theoretical point of departure
Earlier research has shown that ethnic minority populations are significantly more likely to suffer from crime compared to non-minority populations. The most common way of explaining this pattern has been to draw inspiration from routine and lifestyle models (Cohen and Felson, 1979; Hindelang et al., 1978). According to this perspective, it is hypothesized that minority populations suffer from high rates of victimization as a consequence of living and working in high-risk environments, or that they suffer from crime as a consequence of being involved in norm-breaking activities themselves (Skogan and Maxfield, 1980). The criminal incidents to which the Roma are exposed may be explained by the group’s marginalized life situation. Research has shown that the Roma rank lower in many social indicators in comparison to non-Roma individuals in Sweden (SOU, 2010; 55). However, no empirical study has tested whether the Roma community’s marginalization can explain their crime exposure. Furthermore, as has been noted by several researchers, the most distinguishing feature of vulnerable populations’ victimization is that they are at risk of suffering from bias-motivated victimization and, thus, of being targeted by offenders based on their group identity (Perry, 2001).
Before a minority community can be targeted, they must first be made ‘visible’ and set outside the societal norm (Perry, 2015). Most theories that have sought to explain how negative attitudes develop towards different marginalized groups argue that it starts by a process through which an ‘Us’ and a ‘Them’ are constructed based on group identities. Several theoretical models have been developed that emphasize different social mechanisms that are believed to create these negative attitudes; most importantly, if the primary threat posed by the minority is viewed to be cultural or economic, there are several theoretical overlaps between them (Plous, 2003). The current dominant theory for explaining bias incidents is that of Barbara Perry (2001), who argues that bias crime is an act of violence and intimidation, usually directed towards already stigmatized groups and carried out to keep individuals down in a social hierarchy. Those who do not resemble the norm of an ‘Us’ come to represent an ‘Other’ that is less valued, at best, and directly stigmatized through various forms of discriminatory practices such as bias crime, at worst (Perry, 2001). This perspective is suitable for analysing the Roma since the group has a long history of being set apart from society (Selling, 2013; Westin et al., 2014). Chakraborti and Garland (2012), however, have criticized Perry (2001), arguing that the interpretation of bias crime as structural leads us to overlook its situational causes. They acknowledge that norms govern behaviour and occasionally give rise to bias incidents. However, they also present other factors that can cause prejudiced behaviour on a situational basis, including the interpretation of the victim as a vulnerable and easy target. Current empirical evidence gives support for bias crimes being driven both by cultural tensions and by lifestyle-related factors (Van Kesteren, 2016). This indicates the importance of analysing victimization on the basis of both social and contextual factors.
Thus, according to current theory development, a minority group’s visibility should constitute a risk factor for victimization. Some argue that this pattern is rooted in social power structures and that bias incidents serve both a symbolic and an instrumental function in controlling stigmatized populations (Goffman, 1963; Perry, 2001, 2015), while others argue that the pattern may be explained by the fact that a minority population’s visibility is related to the offenders’ ability to exploit their vulnerability (Chakraborti and Garland, 2012). It should be noted that it is not only physical visibility that is of importance. According to Goffman (1963), stigma becomes visible through the presence of what he calls ‘stigma symbols’, which may be linked to both physical appearance and behaviour.
Earlier studies have indeed noted that the visibility of minority groups is a risk factor for bias victimization. A study by Chongatera (2013), who studied racially visible minority populations in Canada, found that while higher income minimized the likelihood of exposure to bias victimization to some extent, visible race status appeared to be the major and independent determinant of the likelihood of experiencing such incidents. Studies have also focused on the fact that other aspects of visibility, such as whether individuals employ various symbols that signal group belonging, whether individuals practice their culture openly, or whether they have surnames that are perceived as non-normative, also increase the risk of exposure to bias incidents (Khosravi, 2012; Perry, 2015; Tiby, 2001; Wallengren and Mellgren, 2015a; Wigerfelt et al., 2014). Existing studies have shown that one of the most common strategies employed by potential bias victims is to reduce their victimization risk by applying behavioural strategies that reduce their visibility. Commonly used strategies include hiding one’s background, avoiding symbols that may signal group belonging, changing one’s names, trying to speak without an accent, and attempting to avoid contexts that are perceived to be particularly risky (Ford et al., 2012; Rai and Hesse, 1992; Wallengren and Mellgren, 2015a; Wigerfelt and Wigerfelt, 2015a). The use of these strategies implies that potential bias victims come to regard their visibility as a risk factor for victimization.
However, it should be noted that there appears to be some variation between different groups concerning the behavioural strategies employed. The strategy of concealing one’s identity seems to be primarily used by those who are able to hide significant identity markers. For example, the strategy of concealing group belonging has been reported in the Jewish community (Wigerfelt and Wigerfelt, 2015b) but not in the African-Swedish community (Wigerfelt et al., 2014). As regards the Roma, it is possible that different Roma can manipulate these markers in different ways. Two studies by Wallengren and Mellgren (2015a; 2018) provide indications that this is, in fact, the case. The first study examined the experiences of a bias crime in the Swedish Roma community. The second study examined experiences of victimization among EU migrants who support themselves by begging. While members of the Swedish Roma community were able to conceal their identity and did so frequently, the EU migrants did not perceive this as an option due to the necessity of being visible in public settings when they were engaged in begging. This study will contribute to and enlarge the research field by analysing how visibility is related to Roma victimization and victimization consequences in more detail.
Methods and data
The study of victimization concerning a vulnerable research population raises many methodological and ethical difficulties. A fundamental challenge when it comes to the Roma, in a Swedish context, is that we lack information about the size of the community, where they live and other related demographic characteristics. It is also a fact that many Roma are actively hiding their ethnicity from the non-Roma community (Wallengren and Mellgren, 2015a, 2015b, 2018). The lack of ethnic-based registration data and the group’s tendency to conceal their group belonging means that it is in practice impossible to gather a generalizable sample of the community.
To gain access to the field, many researchers have argued for the importance of including representatives from the study population in the research process (Kósa et al., 2007). A commonly used sampling strategy has been to contact members of such populations through their interest associations. However, samples obtained in this way are in many ways problematic (Wallengren and Mellgren, 2015b). In the planning phase of this study, Roma organizations were contacted, but few of these showed an interest in collaborating with the research team, and, ultimately, no organization helped with the data collection. Instead, we had to use other strategies to get access to potential study participants. Within this project, one of the authors (SW) belonged to the Roma minority and earlier had a role as a Roma spokesperson. For this reason, previously established contacts with individual Roma could be used to reach potential study participants. Through these contacts, 22 gatekeepers were contacted, of whom 16 were recruited. These gatekeepers were thus not attached to any particular Roma organization per se but could be described as ‘ordinary’ Roma with an interest in participating in the study. The gatekeepers did not receive any form of payment for participating in the study, or during the data gathering, other than being helped with regard to different costs related to their expenses. The data collection involved a two-phase process of both the distribution of a questionnaire and in-depth interviews.
Questionnaire
During the first phase, the research team wanted to distribute a victimization questionnaire to Roma living in Gothenburg and Malmö. The questionnaire was constructed based on earlier measurements commonly used in victimization surveys (Andersson, 2018). However, in view of earlier research on measurements that can be perceived as ‘too sensitive’ and possibly stigmatizing within the Roma community (Wallengren and Mellgren, 2015b), and after discussions with the study’s gatekeepers, it was concluded that some questions were not suitable to include in the questionnaire. This concerned questions related to the respondents’ socio-economic status, their living situation/geographical location, and their own criminal activities, as well as questions related to especially vulnerable subpopulations (e.g., questions to do with women’s victimization and that of the HBTQ individuals). Thus, such questions were excluded from the questionnaire and this has undoubtedly affected the study’s validity. However, it also made participants more willing to participate in the study and potentially increased their feelings of safety and security.
The anonymity requirement has been highly prioritized in this study. An advantage of this study’s approach of first contacting gatekeepers, who then distributed questionnaires to Roma respondents, means that no one, not even the research team, can find out who has responded to the questionnaire. The gatekeepers received a number of questionnaires in unsealed envelopes. They were instructed to give the questionnaires to individuals whom they considered suitable for the study. The only inclusion criterion was that the study participant should self-identify with the juridical umbrella term Roma, be living in either Gothenburg or Malmö, and be over the age of 16. It should be acknowledged that this approach gave the gatekeepers considerable influence both on the selection process and in the treatment of the study population (Bound, 2012). It was therefore important for us to point out to the gatekeepers that they should draw attention to the purpose of the study, that participation in the study was voluntary, and that the questionnaire should be answered anonymously. To ensure that the gatekeepers did not commit any ethical violations, the questionnaire also contained a formal letter of information about the study and contact details for the research team. In discussions with the data collectors, it was concluded that it would be difficult to translate the questionnaire into Romani chib. The reason for this is that Romani chib is a language but also to a large extent consists of different dialects that differ from each other too much for Romani chib to be used in surveys. The fact that many Swedish Roma lack language skills (SOU, 2010: 55) was also seen as a problem in using Romani chib in the questionnaire. Instead, the questionnaire was conducted in Swedish. The distribution of questionnaires took place between January 2015 and October 2016. The respondents were given two options for returning the questionnaires: either to return them to the person who had distributed them or to send them by mail to the research group in prepaid envelopes. In total, 750 questionnaires were distributed, of which 610 were completed, giving a response rate of 80%, which is high in comparison to earlier studies (Andersson, 2018: Tiby, 2001). During the data collection, some respondents phoned to verify the identity of the researcher and were not willing to complete the survey until the researcher’s identity as a Roma had been established. This shows the benefits of involving members of the community in the research process.
Measures
The background variables included in the questionnaire are: Gender (0=male, 1=female); Residence (0=Malmo, 1=Goteborg); Age (0=16–19 years, 1= 20–29 years, 2= 30–39 years, 3= 40–49 years, 4 = over 50 years of age); Housing type (0=privately owned apartment, 1= house, 2= rented apartment); and Subgroup membership (0=Traveller, 1= Swedish Roma, 2= Finnish Roma, 3= Non-European Roma, 4= Newly arrived Roma).
Regarding victimization, we asked respondents: ‘Have you experienced any type of crime during the last 12 months?’ (Answer categories, if yes, were: threats, harassment, or bullying [either verbal or written], minor assault and aggravated assault, robbery, burglary and discrimination.) The respondent could answer no (=0) and yes (=1). With regard to bias victimization, we asked respondents in a follow-up question if the incident they had suffered during the last 12 months was founded on hostility towards or prejudice against their ethnic background. The respondent could answer no (=0) and yes (=1). In a series of follow-up questions, respondents were asked to state how many times they had been victimized (‘Give a number’), where the victimization occurred (‘Name a place in free text’), and what their relationship with the perpetrator was. Response alternatives for the relationship with the offender were: friend, acquaintance, stranger, partner or ex-partner, family member or resident in the local area. The questions used allow for a wide range of behaviours that the respondent could interpret as a bias crime. The legal definition of bias crime (or hate crime) in a Swedish context can be found in two legal sections and one penalty enhancement rule. The first is unlawful discrimination (Chapter 16, Section 9 of the Swedish Penal Code), and the second is incitement to hatred (Chapter 16, Section 8 of the Swedish Penal Code). The crimes not covered by these sections are included under the sentencing enhancement rule, introduced in 1994 (Chapter 29, Section 2, paragraph 7 of the Swedish Penal Code). According to this law (Law, 1994: 306), when a motive for crime is to aggrieve a person, ethnic group or some other similar group of people, by reason of race, colour, national or ethnic origin, religious belief or other similar circumstances, this should be considered an aggravating circumstance when assessing the seriousness of the act. The legal definition thus includes the definition of bias crime applied in this study, but this study has a victim perspective, which means that it is the victim’s perception of the act that defines whether or not it was bias-motivated.
To investigate the role played by visibility in relation to victimization, three questions about visibility were included in the survey. The first was ‘Do you wear symbols or clothing that are associated with your background?’ Secondly, we included the question if the respondents actively try to hide their ethnicity: ‘Do you actively try to hide your background?’ (Answer categories: 0=Never, 1=Rarely, 2=Sometimes, 3=Always). Lastly, to obtain a more specific understanding of whether the respondents are perceived by others as Roma, we added a question: ‘Do you believe that most other people perceive you as you described your background?’ (Answer categories: 0=No, nobody, 1=A few people, 2=Yes, most people, 3=Yes, everyone).
Sample characteristics
The characteristics of the questionnaire respondents are briefly presented in Table 1. As we can see, the gender distribution was relatively even in the sample as a whole: women=313, men =297. It is not possible to compare the sample characteristics to the general Roma population since there is no ethnic registration in Sweden. However, when comparing the respondent’s characteristics with the general Swedish population it is clear that the respondents of this survey were significantly younger than the general Swedish population and to a lesser extent owned their housing (SCB, 2019). It is also clear that the sample contains an overrepresentation of the Roma subpopulation ‘Travellers’. According to estimates, it is believed that about half of the Roma in Sweden belong to the Traveller community (SOU, 2010: 55).

Interviews
In the second phase of the data collection, those who had participated in the questionnaire survey were asked whether they would agree to participate in interviews. Within the project as a whole, 52 individuals who had participated in the questionnaire survey contacted the research team. Subsequently, a selection of study participants was made, where the research group had the objective of obtaining a variety of individuals regarding Roma subgroup belonging, age and gender. In the end, 30 Roma individuals were interviewed. Before the interviews took place, the research team asked the study participants if they found the quantitative phase, and the interaction between themselves and the gatekeepers, satisfactory, and they were once again informed about the purpose of the study. Study participants signed a written consent form before any recording began. All interviews were recorded and then transcribed. The study participants were given a choice to be interviewed by another Roma individual (SW) or by a female non-Roma member of the research team (no one chose the latter). The interviews took place at a location of the study participants’ choosing, most of them in the study participants’ homes, but some at Malmö University. The majority of the interviews were conducted in Swedish, but some were conducted with elements of Romani chib mixed in with Swedish. The interviewed study participants are briefly presented in Table 2. Their names and ages have been changed to ensure their anonymity.

All of the interviewed study participants had at some time been exposed to a bias crime based on their ethnic background. The goal was that the interviews should be conducted individually. However, some study participants preferred for the interviews to be conducted as group interviews. This included Rosa and Peter, who were close friends since childhood; Hans and Ellinor, who were a married couple; Isabell and her daughter Tove; and Jan and his son Charles.
Analytical strategy
The following analytical strategy was employed to answer the study’s questions.
As a first step, we began with a descriptive analysis of the prevalence of victimization in the survey sample. In the second step, we conducted six binary logistic regression analyses in order to analyse how visibility is related to bias and non-bias victimization. We also included gender and age as control variables. Based on earlier theoretical frameworks, we hypothesize that visibility will be significantly related to bias but not non-bias victimization (see e.g. Chakraborti and Garland, 2012; Perry, 2001). In the third step, once the qualitative data had been collected these were analysed using thematic analysis (Braun and Clarke, 2006), in which we sought themes or patterns of relationships between key concepts. We focused on themes and patterns related to visibility and victimization. The analysis was conducted in five steps: (a) initial read-through of the material; (b) additional reading with a focus on recurring themes; (c) initial categorization of themes; (d) further processing of the themes; and (e) final categorization. Thematic development occurred in an inductive or ‘bottom-up’ manner, which means that the themes identified are strongly linked to the data themselves.
Results
Of the 610 respondents in the survey, 221 (36%) reported having experienced at least one form of victimization during the last 12 months, which could be compared to approximately one-fifth of the Swedish population as a whole (National Council for Crime Prevention [BRÅ], 2018) and 46% of respondents in Wallengren and Mellgren’s (2015a) pilot study of Roma living in the Gothenburg region of Sweden. Among the respondents, 23% reported that they had been exposed to more than one crime during the previous 12-month period. The most common types of crime that the respondents reported having experienced were discrimination (30.1%) and threats, bullying or harassment either verbally (25.2%) or over the internet (11.8%). The least common forms of victimization reported by the respondents were minor or aggravated assault (3.7% and 3.3% respectively). The majority of the crimes that the respondents reported having experienced over the last 12 months were perceived as racial bias crimes (52%) and, more specifically, crimes with an anti-Roma motive.
Men reported significantly higher exposure for both non-bias crimes (19.9%) and bias-motivated crime (23.9%) compared to women (approximately 10% of women reported non-bias victimization and 19.2% reported bias victimization). With regard to age, younger respondents were more likely to report being victimized; 52% of the respondents in the age group 16–29 years old reported victimization compared to 14.1% of respondents over the age of 40. Younger respondents also reported significantly higher bias victimization compared to older respondents (34.1% versus 6.6%). In a majority of the cases (approximately 70%), the perpetrator was a person known to the victim. In about 20% of the cases, the perpetrator was a member of the victim’s own ethnic community. The most commonly reported place of incident was the respondent’s living area, where more than half of the criminal incidents had occurred.
Some 55% of the respondents stated that they at least sometimes concealed their ethnicity. There were small but notable differences between individuals who never or sometimes concealed their ethnicity compared to respondents who most of the time or always concealed their ethnicity (37.4% of the first group reported victimization compared to 33.1% of the latter). Regarding bias victimization, 26.3% of individuals who never or sometimes concealed their ethnicity reported bias victimization compared to 9% of respondents who most of the time or always concealed their ethnicity. Respondents who tended to use cultural symbols reported significantly more victimization compared to respondents who seldom or never used such symbols (16.9% compared to 54.8%). With regard to perceptional visibility, 31.9% of respondents who reported that none or few individuals perceive them as Roma had been victimized compared to 34.3% of respondents who believed that most or everyone perceived them as Roma.
Visibility and victimization
The main purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between visibility and victimization. As we have seen, at the descriptive level, the results seem to support that visibility is related to bias victimization. To discover whether visibility has a more independent effect on victimization, binary logistic regression analyses were conducted for three types of visibility: symbolic visibility, perceptional visibility and concealment of ethnicity (the concealment of ethnicity scale have been turned). Gender and age were used in all analyses as background variables. As the predicted variable, we used victimization during the last 12-month period, both with and without bias motive. The result can be seen in Table 3.

As we can see from the analysis, we found a negative relationship between perceptional visibility and non-bias victimization but a positive relationship between perceptional visibility and experiencing bias victimization (for each unit’s increase in perceptional visibility, the odds are 0.27 times less to be exposed to non-bias victimization but an increase of 2.3 with regard to bias victimization). With regard to non-bias victimization, we also found a significant relationship with gender, where men were more likely to report victimization than women (the risk is about 0.57 lower for females). We also found age to have a negative relationship with reporting non-bias victimization (for each unit’s increase in age the risk was 0.20 times lower). Also with regard to reporting bias victimization, we found a significant relationship with gender, where men were more likely to report bias victimization than women (the risk is about 0.36 lower for females) and that age has a negative relationship with reporting bias victimization (for each unit’s increase in age we found the risk was about 0.60 times lower).
With regards to symbolic visibility, we found a negative relationship with non-bias victimization and a positive relationship with bias victimization (for each unit’s increase in symbolic visibility, the odds are 0.3 times lower to be exposed to non-bias victimization but increases by 1.85 with regard to bias victimization). Women were found to be significantly less likely to report non-bias victimization compared to men (with an odds of 0.6 times lower risk) and with regard to bias victimization we did not find a significant relationship. Age was significantly related to both bias (for each unit’s increase in age the risk was 0.45 times smaller) and non-bias victimization (0.27 times lower) with older respondents being less likely to report victimization.
With regard to concealment of ethnicity, we found a significant relationship between both bias and non-bias victimization (for each unit’s increase in concealment (i.e. increased visibility) the odds of reporting bias victimization increases 1.5 times while the odds decreases by 0.34 times for non-bias victimization). Regarding non-bias victimization, we found a significant relationship with gender, where women were less likely to report non-bias victimization compared to men (odds for women were 0.6 times lower) but for bias victimization we did not find a significant relationship with regard to gender. Furthermore, we found a negative association with age, where older respondents were less likely to report both non-bias victimization (for each unit’s increase in age the risk was 0.25 times smaller) and for bias victimization (the risk was 0.5 times smaller).
To summarize, the analysis shows that there is a relationship between visibility and bias victimization. This pattern is in line with theoretical frameworks that predict that ‘visibility’ should be related to experiencing bias-motivated crimes. The next section will deal with the qualitative data material.
Thematic analysis of interviews
The analysis of the interviews resulted in three overarching themes: (a) Roma visibility and vulnerability; (b) strategies to conceal visibility; and (c) resulting individual and community effects.
Roma visibility and vulnerability
All of the interviewed study participants claimed that the Roma are a vulnerable group with respect to victimization. Of the 30 study participants, 12 emphasized the group’s social disadvantage in the explanation of the group’s victimization risk. These study participants proposed that one reason that the Roma are more likely than non-Roma to be victimized is that they live in high-risk neighbourhoods and often lead marginalized lives where, for example, the prevalence of alcohol and drug usage is high. These study participants argue that the group’s socio-economic vulnerability makes it difficult for them to protect themselves from crime. However, Peter and Rosa argued that this is not true for the younger Roma, who are much better integrated into Swedish society than the older generation.
All of the study participants agreed that the main reason that the Roma are at risk of victimization is the majority society’s negative attitudes towards the group. Thus, the study participants did highlight that visibility is an important risk factor for explaining their victimization. However, even though some Roma subpopulations are claimed to be more vulnerable due to their physical appearance, all of the study participants except Vincent and Isabell pointed out that it is not physical appearance that is the main form of visibility risk factor. Instead, the study participants discuss a border form of visibility, in the sense that people in the individuals’ surroundings know about the study participants’ ethnic background through information about their family background.
Thus, the study participants appear to support the view that social disadvantage and ethnicity are both factors that increase the group’s overall vulnerability and victimization risk. In practice, however, it is argued that the aforementioned vulnerabilities are not entirely different from one another. The study participants claimed that different Roma families and individuals have different opportunities to conceal their ethnicity in different settings. Felicia, Diana and Vincent argued that it is harder for individuals living in communities characterized by an ethnically heterogeneous population to hide their ethnicity, due to an interest that people in such communities have in knowing what heritage a specific individual or family has.
Strategies to conceal visibility and combat victimization risk
At the time of the interview, all of the interviewed study participants reported using strategies, or having used strategies, to minimize their visibility and thus the risk of victimization. Commonly used strategies include hiding one’s background, changing one’s names and avoiding non-Roma contexts. The strategies resorted to vary across the individual’s life course.
Some of the interviewed study participants told us during our discussions that it was common for their families to try to hide their ethnicity in quite drastic ways. Some of the study participants even claimed that it had until recently been common for them to conceal their ethnicity from partners, family members or even their children. Rosa told us that she had tried to hide her ethnicity more or less throughout her entire lifespan. ‘I didn’t tell anyone that I was a tattare [authors’ note: ‘tattare’=a degrading term often used towards the Travellers]. Not my two husbands and not my children.’ Out of 30 study participants, 11 also told us that it is taboo for them to openly identify themselves as members of the community to outsiders, particularly if there is a risk that this might affect other community members. Furthermore, some of these study participants argued that if they are too open with their ethnicity to outsiders, there is a risk that other community and family members may stop associating with them, or even threaten and harass them.
However, nine of the study participants argued that although it is indeed common that some members of their community do hide their ethnicity in this way, individuals might lose their status within their community if they are perceived to be concealing their group identity too much from non-Roma. These study participants instead told us that they hide their ethnicity while applying for jobs or housing, and from neighbours or classmates, but not from family members.
In line with our conclusion in the earlier section, the study participants claimed that in certain instances it is not practical, nor always possible, to hide their ethnicity. In these circumstances, participants use other strategies to protect themselves. Most notably, study participants claimed that they scan new contexts for signs of risk and potential offenders. These study participants described a heightened awareness and increased suspicion. They described how they would ‘lie low’ but pay attention to how non-Roma talk, and particularly whether they make intolerant statements about different groups. Some study participants also claimed that they use more proactive behaviours to identify possible offenders, such as denigrating different racial groups (for instance, their own) and then reading the response.
Individual negative consequences of concealing group belonging
Researchers have observed that individuals who conceal their identity often perceive this strategy to be something of a double-edged sword (Meyer, 2003). Concealing one’s identity can provide a sense of security. However, in certain situations, it can also cause anxiety and fear. In this study, there were participants who told us that concealing their group belonging was relatively unproblematic. Concealing their Roma heritage in certain situations and contexts is something which the group, as David told us, ‘simply does’. According to these participants, the concealment strategy makes them feel safer or at least makes it possible for them to relax. They do not have to prepare themselves to discuss, explain or protect aspects of their ethnicity to non-Roma individuals.
At the same time, there were participants who told us that the concealment strategy was both ineffective and problematic in several ways. Firstly, hiding their identity makes many of the study participants feel dehumanized and ashamed. Furthermore, the participants do not trust their ability to conceal their ethnicity effectively. They told us that they feel that they always need to be on the alert and to make sure that they (or others) do not do or say anything that might make people aware of their group belonging. Secondly, by comparison with individuals who are open about their ethnicity, individuals who belong to a stigmatized community, and are successful in concealing it, may encounter situations in which they are forced to listen to ridicule and resentment focused on their community, from individuals whom they would probably not encounter if they were open about their identity. In this study, eight study participants testified that they had encountered situations in which individuals have talked negatively about ‘beggars’, ‘gypsies’ or ‘tinkers’ without knowing that the participants identified themselves with the ridiculed group. Thirdly, the study participants may not know exactly how others will react if they reveal their identity, or indeed if individuals in their surroundings already know about their group belonging. Individuals who are successful in concealing their identity do not experience being ‘challenged’ in their view that people in their surroundings may not have negative attitudes about their group. Five out of the 30 interviewed study participants told us different ‘coming-out’ stories and that they were sometimes surprised that loved ones did not care about their ethnic background or see it as something negative.
Empirical studies have shown that victims of bias crime are at risk of developing different forms of negative emotional, psychological and health outcomes as a consequence of their victimization (Iganski, 2008; Iganski and Lagou, 2015; Lehavot and Simoni, 2011; Mellgren et al., 2017). In this study, the participants often described how they had developed various problems as a consequence of living with a stigmatized identity and trying to combat this by using the strategy of concealment. There were participants who told us that they had become paranoid and that they had always lived with an intrusive feeling of being ‘looked down upon’ by other people. As a result, they described not trusting other individuals and said that they had developed an aggressive way of solving conflicts and that they had problems investing in social relationships. Some also said that they believed that it is common that individuals from their community who have these feelings are at risk of using drugs and alcohol to combat their anxiety, feelings of inferiority, self-hatred and isolation. Of the 30 study participants, 10 told us that they believed that they needed professional help to solve some of their psychological problems. As a final note, nine of the 30 study participants claimed that the feelings of stigma had affected their ability both to participate in Swedish society and to invest in their future. These study participants expressed a loss of self-esteem and human value and described having a hard time imagining who they would be and what their lives would be like in the absence of these behavioural changes, adaptations and feelings of inferiority.
Community consequences of concealing group belonging
It is clear from the study participants’ testimonies that strategies of concealment hurt the Roma community at large. These effects seem to cause frictions between members of the community, but they also, as we will see, seem to have had an impact on the Roma culture, both with respect to its expressions and in relation to individuals’ ability to participate in their culture and develop their cultural identity.
Study participants told us that they had employed strategies of concealment since childhood and that these strategies were taught to them by their parents. There was a number, particularly among the younger participants, who told us that they do not think that the concealment strategy should be used by the younger generations, because it is ineffective and also destructive. At the same time, most of the study participants have children, and it was common for them to express worry about their children’s safety and to question whether or not their children should hide their ethnicity. Maja, who was pregnant with her first child at the time of the interview, told us: I’m so happy, but it’s also strange. My husband and I are already thinking about my girl’s future. Should I encourage her to tell people about her background while she is a child, or should I tell her to hide it until she is older and can stand up for herself? In this study, both older and younger participants told us that they believe that there is a social mechanism present in their community whereby Roma children are, to some extent, socialized to anticipate stigma. Eight of the study participants discussed how they, as children or teenagers, had parents who often had an intolerant attitude to drinking, how their parents sometimes controlled who their children were allowed to meet, how they were told to be home early in the evenings, and, most importantly, how they were told not to tell people about their background. Most of these participants described this as an overly protective upbringing, even though it was well-intentioned, and also as somewhat problematic. In certain cases, they also reported having experienced feelings of isolation within their community as a result.
Some of the study participants told us that their parents did not tell them about their ethnicity until they were older. In other cases, families had been open about their family background but had remained secretive about their culture and were opposed to their children learning certain aspects of their culture, such as the language. The study participants who were raised in an environment in which the culture was ‘hidden’ sometimes expressed anger over the fact that they had lost some aspects of their culture or that they did not have the ability to gain or develop a ‘Roma identity’. In a group interview with Charlotte and her daughter Tove, Tove told us: I feel lost in all of this, and I don’t know who to blame. It’s frustrating; I haven’t been raised in the culture, not truly. There were also those who claimed that it is problematic that individuals who belong to the community try to hide their ethnicity and culture in more general terms. Morgan, for example, argued that one consequence of this concealment is that younger individuals have lost their culture and identity as Roma. During our discussion, he told us that: It isn’t good when they try to hide it. They stop speaking our language and then they are not Roma anymore. Thus, the fact that the group uses the strategy of concealment to a varying degree seems to have a profound effect on both individuals’ ability to practise their culture and their feelings of cultural identity.
As was noted earlier, some of the study participants told us that there is a taboo about being open with their ethnicity to outsiders. Some participants explained that this is a consequence of the fact that a ‘silent culture’ has developed in some of the Roma communities as a result of stigmatization. According to some, individuals who do not uphold this ‘agreement’ to keep the Roma culture protected from outsiders may be punished. Some individuals who participated in this study had been activists for Roma issues, and they stated that it was relatively common for them to have been discriminated against by other Roma, as many Roma do not want their culture to be shown to outsiders. These study participants argued that they did not engage in politics, because they believed that they would be discriminated against both by other Roma and by members of the majority society. One study participant, Morgan, criticized those who engage in the public debate relating to ‘Roma issues’: I find it immoral to go out and talk about our culture and problems with outsiders. They put us all at risk. We have never needed the government to help us keep our language or identity. It’s better that we keep quiet as we always have done.
Discussion
A liberal democratic society must guarantee individuals both safety and the opportunity to express, practise and develop their cultural, sexual or religious identity in the public sphere. This study has described the prevalence and impact of victimization among a sample of the Roma minority in Sweden. The results of this study contribute to our collective knowledge of the Roma community’s vulnerability to victimization. In this study, 36% of the respondents reported having experienced at least one form of victimization during the last 12 months and about half of these incidents (52%) were perceived as racial bias crimes committed with an anti-Roma motive. In the majority of cases, the crimes reported by the respondents were different forms of discrimination and verbal forms of harassment. Compared to the general Swedish population, the prevalence of the respondents’ victimization is high. However, the results of this study are in line with previous studies concerning the victimization experiences of Swedish Roma (Wallengren and Mellgren, 2015a), indicating that the group indeed is vulnerable to victimization and highlighting the importance of conducting self-report studies regarding the group’s victimization experiences.
One way of summarizing the study’s results would be that the degree of visibility and the expression of cultural manifestations that an individual carries with her seem to play an important role in shaping individuals’ victimization exposure risk, lives and opportunities. In line with current theoretical developments, we hypothesized that visibility would be related to bias victimization (Chakraborti and Garland, 2012; Goffman, 1963; Perry, 2015). We did find a positive relationship between our measurements of visibility and bias victimization (taking gender and age into account). However, based on this study’s data, it is not possible to determine whether visibility is an independent risk factor for experiencing bias victimization. It is possible that people who are more visible have different routine activities and encounter more risky situations than individuals who are less visible (Cohen and Felson, 1979; Hindelang et al., 1978; Wallengren and Mellgren, 2015a). As both the study’s survey respondents and interviewed study participants stated that they mainly were victimized in their living area, this could indicate that lifestyle-related variables indeed are of importance. A further explanation of the differences in levels of victimization between the visible and the less visible respondents may be that the more visible are more aware of (or sensitive to) perceiving different acts as bias-motivated, while less visible individuals do not. In the study’s qualitative data, it was argued that the main visibility risk factor is others knowing about the respondent’s ethnicity, not the group’s physical appearance. This corresponds well with the quantitative analysis where ‘perceptional visibility’ was found to be the strongest factor associated with bias victimization in comparison to ‘symbolic visibility’ and the strategy of concealment. The reason that physical visibility, according to the study participants, is not associated with victimization might be that non-Roma lack knowledge of the Roma community’s symbols, that the group’s physical appearance is not notably different from that of mainstream society, and also that individuals who belong to the Roma community are concealing their ethnicity.
This study also points to the problems of living with a stigmatized identity. A strikingly high proportion of the respondents in this study (55%) reported that they chose to conceal their ethnicity due to fear of victimization. Some of the study participants did not view this as problematic. Others, however, believed that the strategy had caused several forms of harm. In line with previous research, the study participants argued that, at the individual level, concealment caused feelings of dehumanization, shame, self-hatred, inferiority, fear and anxiety, and produced a lack of trust (Goffman, 1963). In addition to these individual-level effects, however, this study highlights the negative community effects of concealment. The study participants argued that the concealment strategy had in some cases limited individuals’ access to their cultural identity and that some individuals felt isolated in their communities. This study’s results also support the assumption that victimization and stigmatization have a disempowering effect on vulnerable populations and limit their ability to improve their societal position (Goffman, 1963). Several study participants argued that their stigmatization had affected their ability to live the life they would have wanted. Actual and perceived victimization directed towards marginalized communities could thus be viewed as a democratic problem that intensifies inequalities between different populations.
A number of limitations associated with the study must be acknowledged. First of all, since we lack population-level data on the Roma in Sweden, it is not possible to draw a random sample of the Roma population and thus generalize results. A subpopulation of Roma, the Travellers, were overrepresented in the current sample. Approximately 70% of the sample consisted of this subgroup, which is estimated to be about half of the Roma population in Sweden. This group is often believed to have a stronger socio-economic status compared to other Roma subpopulations (SOU, 2010: 55), limiting the validity of the study. Another limitation was that, for ethical reasons, we were unable to include background variables in the analysis related to the respondents’ lifestyles. In addition, the following two political developments occurred in Sweden during the planning phase of the study, which strongly prevented us including some of these background variables. One incident was the growing support for the populist party the Swedish Democrats (Sverigedemokraterna) and the polarizing debate that surrounded their growing support that scared many Roma living in Sweden at the time. The second incident contributing to the group’s unwillingness to respond to such variables was that the Swedish police in the autumn of 2013 had an illegal database of Roma consisting of 4000 individuals. It is likely that this incident has heavily damaged the Roma community’s trust in the authorities (Wigerfelt and Wigerfelt, 2015a) and by extension the research community. Finally, visibility is a somewhat problematic measure. The meaning of visibility is dependent on different individuals’ knowledge and perceptions, and it may vary between different historical periods and contexts. Our measurements for visibility are also, in reality, overlapping with one another and with behavioural strategies often used by victims of crime to minimize the risk of being exposed to victimization. However, we do believe that our use of a mixed approach made it possible to overcome some of these limitations. The methodological choice of using a mixed methodology approach enabled the participants to reflect on and explain various difficult concepts relating to their victimization experiences and consequences of victimization. It also enabled the research team to capture the study participants’ experiences and perceptions of different forms of social problems that were perceived as too sensitive to gather during the quantitative phase of the study. We would argue that our use of a mixed methodology approach, allowing the survey and interview data to inform one another, strengthens the study’s validity and provides us with a deeper understanding of the group’s experiences and the relationship between visibility and victimization.
Further research and policy implications
The study’s finding that the Roma are experiencing a high prevalence of victimization, and that visibility seems to be an important risk factor in explaining this pattern, calls for action. We do not claim that the current study provides any significant answers to many of the difficult questions facing those who are interested in developing policies to support vulnerable populations in relation to victimization. However, we would argue that some implications might be drawn from the study’s results.
Firstly, we believe that members of the Roma community may be experiencing problems associated with the acknowledgment of their Roma identity. The so-called Roma have a shifting view of their ethnicity, and some are critical of the use of the Roma label. This is problematic. It is possible that such individuals will not seek support or help if their self-proclaimed identity is not acknowledged. It is also possible that different forms of messages from mainstream society that are intended to show support towards the ‘Roma’ may have the opposite effect on those individuals who do not identify with the community. It is important that Swedish society develops an understanding of the complexities of the inner lives of those living in this community and respects their self-proclaimed identities. Also, we would argue that the study highlights a number of criticisms that may be directed at the hypothesis that bias victimization is more damaging than non-bias victimization due to the fact that bias incidents are intended to damage the victim’s ‘self’ (Iganski, 2008; Perry, 2001). As has been highlighted by Andersson (2018), the object that is targeted in a bias incident is not the self of the victim, but rather a negative stereotype. The participants in this study suffered both victimization and fear of being victimized as a result of their ‘Roma’ ethnicity, irrespective of whether or not they identified with this particular label or group. We would argue that further research should consider bias incidents as a violation of the victims’ opportunities for self-representation, but not necessarily of their self and their identity.
Secondly, it is clear from the study’s findings that there are some Roma who fear the ‘coming-out process’. There is, therefore, a need to develop strategies to support these individuals. We would like to highlight the fact that, according to the results of the current study, there appear to be control mechanisms within the Roma community which mean that those Roma who question the concealment strategy may be discriminated against by their community. This is problematic since there is evidence that the negative consequences of victimization may be more severe if one is victimized by individuals with whom one identifies (Herman, 2015). Also, those Roma who become involved in politics appear to be most at risk. Future research should further investigate this issue. It may be particularly important to gather data on those Roma who are engaged in the political debate on Roma issues.
Finally, being visible in a given society is not in itself inherently disempowering. Being invisible in the political sphere may also cause powerlessness (Perry, 2015). This study shows the importance of gathering and having access to data on different vulnerable populations in society. As a result of a relatively recent wave of migration to Sweden, Swedish society is not as homogenous today as it was a century ago. There are also indications that certain ethnic groups are faring a great deal worse than the ethnic Swedish population in several social aspects. However, due to Sweden not collecting demographic statistics on minorities, it is difficult to draw any conclusions about the situation of different groups regarding, for example, victimization, health or employment. We would argue that Sweden should review the possibility of developing equality data as a means of supporting its minority populations. Some minorities would no doubt be critical of the collection of such data, including the Roma. However, if such data were to be collected, it would also provide the community in question with the opportunity to use this information to support their community more effectively. Until such data are available, researchers should devote their attention to developing strategies for obtaining access to the difficult research field of vulnerable populations. Providing support to society’s marginalized and stigmatized populations is both necessary and important, and as this study has shown, the Roma is one such population.

World Jewish Congress President Ronald Lauder denounced it as a 'horrific racist act.'2 The Union for Reform Judaism issued a statement that read, 'Black Lives Matter Is a Jewish Value.'3 The Orthodox Jewish Union (OU) declared, 'Racism is not a thing of the past or simply a political issue. It is a real and present danger that must be met head-on.'4Boycott Divestment Sanctions (BDS) organizations have ratcheted up racial tensions and anti-Semitic agitation by accusing Israel of complicity in the Floyd murder.5 The BDS strategy is not new. The Jewish State has, for some years, been recast as an illegitimate 'white oppressor' state.Ongoing demonstrations across the United States have reenergized the intersectional solidarity between those protesting anti-Black racism in America and BDS organizations' demands to 'Free Palestine from the [Jordan] River to the [Mediterranean] Sea' - a clarion call to dismantle the State of Israel.The BDS-BLM convergence, then, as it relates to the Palestinian issue, has removed the Palestinian-Israeli conflict from its territorial framework and has recast the Jewish nation-state as a racial issue - 'apartheid' and illegitimate by definition.Israel adversary Linda Sarsour applauded longtime Israel critic Peter Beinart's recent disavowal of Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people. 
She praised Beinart for legitimizing Palestinian rejectionism of Jewish sovereignty, saying, 'Maybe Zionists will listen to one of their own. Peter has evolved over the years, and I welcome his evolution.'This new radical discourse demands that American Jews be neither liberal nor progressive. Those affiliations accept the existence of the Jewish State, yet are deemed unacceptable according to the 'virtues' of a more drastic American dialogue.The blatant anti-Semitism of Bill de Blasio[2] Those targeting Jews were other minorities, mainly black and Hispanic New Yorkers. De Blasio did not push back against the dangerous new bail-reform law, which essentially gave a slap on the wrist for criminals and those who did end up in jail ended up being released shortly after committing crimes. He did nothing to protect his Jewish residents.When the Iranian-backed, terrorist-in-nature Al-Quds Day event was held last year in Times Square, the anti-Israel groups participating had to get a permit; that was allowed. Not even a few weeks ago, a ""Day of Rage"" protest/march was held in Brooklyn, these events explicitly target Israel which directly is an attack on Jews and often times leads to anti-Semitic incidents. Yet were there any neo-Nazi marches in New York City? Not that those should ever be encouraged, of course, but de Blasio would not give such an easy permit to white supremacists, as he does to every other Jew-hater.When New York was in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic, only the Hassidic Jewish community was the target of de Blasio's ire. Yet there were overcrowding issues in the Bronx and house parties in Harlem. Being vigilant was all in the name of beating the virus, so most Jews did not say much. However, when a legitimate Chassidic funeral on April 28 was planned not only with the approval of the New York Police Department but with pre-approval of the Mayor's Office, de Blasio showed up, ""shocked"" at the crowd size, and immediately fired off an anti-Semitic tweet directed at the Jewish community. The Jewish community in New York is not cohesive; dozens of vibrant groups make up the proud fabric of Jewry in New York, so to blame ""all Jews"" due to one pre-arranged funeral, while ignoring other groups who were gathering in large numbers, was absolutely anti-Semitic.One would think that letting Hassidic children play in neighborhood playgrounds would be far less a crime than thousands marching, many without face masks, but no. De Blasio ordered the police to fine parents whose children went without masks. This behavior towards the religious Jewish community was an injustice when such hypocrisy was on full display during the height of the BLM protests and interwoven riots.De Blasio's anti-Semitic culture extends beyond himself. Earlier this year, Democrat Councilman Kalman Yeger pointed out the poison of anti-Semitism permeating within the City Council. And mere days ago, a City of New York tweet reminded residents to fill out the 2020 Census. It included a ""Palestinian"" flag among other flags representing the homelands of the city's residents, but omitted the Israeli flag, despite nearly 2 million Jews living in New York City. To not call out de Blasio as a dangerous anti-Semite is a farce.Former NYPD commissioner warns US Jews: Protect your communities[3] Jewish communities in America should follow the example of those in Europe and put security measures in place in synagogues, Former NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly has said in an interview, as he warned that 'we are in a dangerous place in history.'Budget cuts due to the coronavirus lockdown and an erosion of respect for police officers are creating a perfect storm that will see safety decline in New York and elsewhere, Kelly told Matthew Bronfman, chair of the International Steering Committee of Limmud FSU during an online interview.'In the US the Jewish community needs to be more alert about who is entering community premises,' Kelly said, warning that in today's environment, synagogues cannot be fully open environments.Kelly, who now heads the Anti-Semitism Accountability Project (ASAP), has visited ten European countries to meet with government and faith leaders to examine how antisemitism is being tackled on the Continent in comparison with the US, he said.'Antisemitism there is not new. Neo-Nazis have never gone away, and populism is helping them flex their muscles,' Kelly noted. He acknowledged that the threat was slightly different in the two areas - in France, for example, antisemitism is driven by the left's support for the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement and the Muslim community, combined with a government which, thanks to a national culture of secularism, is slow to recognize the religious rights of minorities. Consequently, people can walk around with openly antisemitic messages on their t-shirts without consequence, he said. Hen Mazzig: How Jewish Twitter users and celebrities took down a virtual anti-Semitic mob[4] When I saw ""#JewishPrivilege"" was trending on Twitter last week, I cringed. White nationalists had created the hashtag to spread anti-Semitic conspiracies about Jews being ""privileged"" - that we control the media, the banks and the world. Seemingly progressive Twitter users soon piled on with false claims that Jews don't face any discrimination, while also suggesting they are responsible for the discrimination and other ills many minorities face. This felt like an organized attack - as if everyone was in agreement that Jewish people are to be blamed for all that is wrong in the world.The virtual mob of anti-Semites sparked flashbacks to my Iraqi grandma retelling stories of surviving the Farhud, a massacre in which a real-life mob of Iraqis murdered all the Jews they could in Baghdad back in 1941. So I urged Jews on Twitter to share their personal stories to refute the #JewishPrivilege falsehood. In a matter of hours, Jews shared their experiences of discrimination, violence, exile and mass murder.The notion that Jews of any background are the oppressors rather than the oppressed erases our history - including the Holocaust and pogroms of many decades past, as well as more recent chapters, like the plight of the Ethiopian Jews who escaped persecution in Ethiopia by airlifts to Israel in the 1980s and '90s. Seeking to deny the entire Jewish people's generational struggles and erase us from the collective of minority groups denies our humanity and identity, and is thereby an act of deep-seated anti-Semitism.https://www.mrdrybones.com/blog/D20629_1.png Honest Reporting: Bari Weiss Leaves NYT: HonestReporting Responds[5] Journalism vs. activismSome journalists will argue that no one can be truly objective, and this is true. However, that's like saying that a doctor cannot possibly save every patient. That is also true, but a doctor can try. And therein lies the difference: a journalist can always try to be objective and enlightening, to put their own opinions to the side and to inform people in a way that enriches our society, rather than trying to dominate it. Many journalists do the opposite: they try to be activists, and even act abusively toward their colleagues who do otherwise. And if Weiss' resignation is any indication, those activists are winning.Certainly there is a place for activism: many people and groups do excellent work lobbying for specific, worthy causes, and even unworthy causes. However, to call yourself a 'journalist,' and yet behave as an activist, is simply dishonest: you are declaring to the world that you are a source of reliable, unbiased information, even as you work with specific intent to do the opposite. OptimismDespite it all, we at HonestReporting remain optimistic. Bari Weiss eloquently captured the source of our optimism in this statement: 'Even now, I am confident that most people at The Times do not hold these views. Yet they are cowed by those who do.'This is, apparently, the state of journalism today: an industry made up of many thoughtful, competent people who work in fear of a minority who are the loudest, most hateful, and most driven by cynical agenda. These are dark times for professional journalism, but not devoid of hope. We see that hope every time HonestReporting achieves a correction, adds context or changes and informs the background that guides a journalist's story. We see it every time a journalist thanks us for our help: for teaching them something new or for giving them the solid support they need in order to speak truthfully in the face of pressure. We even see this hope when some journalists, who are intractably infected by agenda or antisemitism, find they have no viable choice but to issue retractions and corrections or simply step back and remain silent. Most of all, we see hope when we issue a 'call to action,' and thousands of readers like you jump in to help: like this week when you spoke up, and then YouTube removed Louis Farrakhan's antisemitic 4th of July speech from their platform.On behalf of HonestReporting, I commend Bari Weiss for her courage and diligence, and cannot wait to see where she ends up next.She, and journalists like her, are a source of inspiration and hope - for all of us. I don't know how else to put it. Lots of media outlets find Iranian butcher Qasem Soleimani more sympathetic than Bari Weiss. THREADWe'll start with @CNN[6]. Soleimani was 'revered and powerful' where Weiss was 'controversial' for criticizing progressive culture. pic.twitter .com/a3jInSUp80[7] — Drew Holden (@DrewHolden360) July 15, 2020[8] ;Noah Rothman: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Epistemic Closure[9] The resignations of New York Times opinion editor Bari Weiss and New York Magazine writer Andrew Sullivan effectively punctuated a week in which the center-left press went to war with itself over the notion that the atmosphere they'd cultivated might not be the most conducive to free and open debate.Both writers—centrist but heterodox insofar as they wrote for liberal publications while being sharply critical of the identitarian excesses and groupthink to which the left has succumbed—are frequent objects of abuse. Their views, which remain well represented within the Democratic coalition, are regularly anathematized by their 'very online' colleagues in opinion journalism as 'controversial,' 'bigoted,' 'racist' 'reactionary'—even targets of the left's 'hate.' As Vanity Fair's Joe Pompeo revealingly wrote, Weiss's conventionally liberal 'commentary often appeals to conservatives'—an unforgivable sin.Criticism of their work bordered on (and regularly veered into) ad hominem. The suppression of their work within their institutions and the internal harassment to which they were subjected simply became too much. So, they will be taking their considerable talents elsewhere.This mounting pile of dead canaries within the liberal coal mine has inspired not introspection but withering mockery and derision. You see, goes this response, there really is no such thing as 'cancel culture.' These voices are free to go wherever they want, just so long as it's somewhere they can be easily ignored.There is a sickness settling over the center-left intellectual landscape. It is one the left could recognize when its symptoms were observed in their political rivals: the plague of 'epistemic closure.' Bruce Bartlett described it as the condition in which an intellectual movement abstains from the necessary work of questioning itself. Rachel Maddow blamed the Republican Party's 2012 losses on the 'factual bubble' in which the conservative movement was cocooned. As the right's more self-critical voices became 'marginalized, even self-marginalizing,' Marc Armbinder observed, it would only settle deeper into a self-reinforcing feedback loop that would foreclose on the prospect of representing a majority constituency.A funny thing has happened as the right has progressed down this intellectual cul-de-sac. Even in the age of Trump, amid the standard pressures on the White House's allies to comport with the party line compounded by this president's unique insecurities, it's been the right that has nurtured an environment of wildly dynamic discourse and philosophical exploration.Seven Unanswered Questions About Bari Weiss' New York Times Exit[10] The public resignation of Bari Weiss from her job as an editor and writer at The New York Times editorial page leaves many questions unanswered. Among them: 4. Will the Times take any action to improve its workplace climate? Doing so would concede that Weiss is correct and accurate in diagnosing the problems there, but failing to do so would be a signal that the paper's leadership is indifferent to the bullying she describes. In a Times news article about the resignation, a Times spokeswoman, Eileen Murphy, said, 'We're committed to fostering an environment of honest, searching and empathetic dialogue between colleagues, one where mutual respect is required of all.' But the Times news article provided no specifics about what the company would do differently to foster that environment, or why and how it has fallen short of that.5. Will the Times bring in another centrist or Zionist voice to replace Weiss to try to combat her claim that the organization couldn't tolerate her views? The same Times news article quoted the acting editorial page editor, Kathleen Kingsbury, as saying, 'I'm personally committed to ensuring that The Times continues to publish voices, experiences and viewpoints from across the political spectrum in the Opinion report.' The question is whether the Kingsbury definition of 'across the political spectrum' is the spectrum between Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar, or between Peter Beinart and Mohammad Javad Zarif, or whether it extends further than that. The Times is already under pressure to fill Weiss' spot with someone of similar ideological ilk. An editor at The Washington Free Beacon, Stephen Gutowski, tweeted, 'If Bari Weiss is wrong and The New York Times opinion section is still committed to intellectual diversity then they will soon hire a center-right columnist who is respected among their ideological cohorts to replace her, yes?'6. Who uttered the Bari's 'writing about the Jews again' comments? Weiss's resignation letter said, 'I have learned to brush off comments about how I'm 'writing about the Jews again.'' Who at the Times made those comments and what do they have to say for themselves?ZOA Sets Up Antisemitism Hotline for New York Times Staffers[11] The Zionist Organization of America (ZOA), the nation's oldest pro-Israel organization, has set up a special antisemitism hotline for Jewish staffers at the New York Times and other outlets who are victims of antisemitism from their colleagues.The ZOA was reacting to the resignation of Times opinion editor Bari Weiss on Tuesday, who left the Times over what she alleged was an increasingly intolerant environment, including antisemitism directed toward her: 'My own forays into Wrongthink have made me the subject of constant bullying by colleagues who disagree with my views. They have called me a Nazi and a racist; I have learned to brush off comments about how I'm 'writing about the Jews again,' she wrote.In response, the ZOA has set up a phone number and email account to receive complaints about media antisemitism.In a statement, ZOA President Morton A. Klein and Chair Mark Levenson said Wednesday:ZOA condemns the hostile antisemitic work environment now on full and public display at the NY Times. Bari Weiss's decision to resign from her position as a writer and editor at the Times highlights the problems of journalists who call out antisemitism on the right and the left, and stand up for Israel.No journalist should pay a price for expressing these views. In her resignation letter, Weiss revealed that her Times colleagues called her 'a Nazi and a racist.' They criticized her for 'writing about the Jews again.'To all journalists: We are with you and we are here to help you. ZOA has a long and proud record of effectively fighting antisemitism and standing up for the rights of Jews and those that support Israel. We do it in the courts, in Congress, in the media, in schools, and on college campuses. Rest assured, ZOA will stand up for you, too.Anti-Racism Erases Anti-Semitism[12] Political conspiracism has its roots in the low religion of the European middle ages. In those terrible times of disease, deprivation, and war, the peasants and townsfolk, and their representatives in the lesser clergy and laity, sought relief by identifying the influence of Satan and his earthly agents: witches and Jews. Contemporary conspiracy theories are often shorn of content that is explicitly paranormal, but the medieval contours remain: They constitute a kind of secular magic that seeks to expose the devil and his collaborators. The oppressed, both perceived and actual, use them to deflect pain and misery from themselves to a scapegoat. And that scapegoat is us.In February, the American Studies Department at Vassar College sponsored a talk about Israel and the Palestinians by the prominent queer theorist Jasbir Puar of Rutgers University. She was introduced by a professor who admonished the assembly against recording her remarks. When Puar took the podium, she congratulated Students for Justice in Palestine, which had helped publicize her appearance, for introducing a Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions resolution at Vassar. The crowd reciprocated with cheers and cries of 'Free, free Palestine!'It became quiet again. Puar began her talk, claiming that the recent spate of stabbings by Palestinians, which she quaintly called a 'people's rumble,' had served as a pretext for Israel to stage 120 'field executions' of young Palestinian boys. Seventeen of these boys' bodies were held, she said, for two months without explanation. Then a convoy of 17 ambulances, one for each body, suddenly left a morgue in West Jerusalem and unfurled along a 'convoluted' route towards Bethlehem. 'Some speculate that the bodies were mined for organs for scientific research,' Puar said.What kind of state would do this? One that claims 'the right to maim and debilitate Palestinian bodies and environments as a form of biopolitical control.' Israel is the apex of predatory imperialism, Puar explained: It controls 'infrastructure' so it can 'modulate calories to provide a bare minimum for survival.' And to what end? To transform the Palestinians into a population of half-fed zombies whose 'dismantled and dismembered bodies' can be subjected to 'gendering,' 'ungendering,' and 'epigenetic deterioration' through biological 'hacking.' This not only enables the extraction of Palestinian resources right down to their very flesh, but it nourishes the Jewish privilege conferred by the Holocaust: '[Israelis] need the Palestinians alive in order to keep the kind of rationalization [sic] for their victimhood and their militarized economy.'I think any Jewish resident of medieval Cologne or Worms would recognize this scene for exactly what it is: In this occulted room, Puar chanted an abracadabra of quasi-religious jargon and blood libels that must have struck her audience as wondrous. Some philosophers important in Puar's field rely on a concept of jouissance, which might adequately be translated as transgressive rapture. Traducing the ideas of Freud, Marx, and Foucault in order to drape medieval Jew-hatred in a sumptuous fabric of critical theory is certainly not what Derrida and Lacan had in mind.It's not enough for the wretched of the earth to identify their oppressors. The people of darkness must be rooted out. They have earned the undying contempt of the children of light. Today the witches are gone, but the Jews remain.The rise of part-time antisemitism blurs traditional definitions[13] There is much debate about whether some people are antisemitic. While many write about antisemitism, very few who do so understand its current complexities. One of the issues many observers have to come to grips with is that much of contemporary Jew-hatred can best be called part-time antisemitism. These are people who commit antisemitic acts or make such statements intermittently. On other occasions, some may even make positive remarks about Jews and/or Israel.Until the Second World War, antisemitism had a limited number of core motifs. These recurred over the centuries. Gradually there were also new mutations of these motifs, while occasionally a new motif appeared. Since the Holocaust, further new expressions of hatred have emerged.One of these is Holocaust inversion: 'Israel behaves toward the Palestinians like the Nazis did toward the Jews.' Yet one can also consider this a mutation of an almost 2,000-year-old core motif: 'Jews are absolute evil.' In our days, being a Nazi is often considered the greatest evil in Western society.There are other changes in expressions of antisemitism taking place. These are often related to general culture. Living in post-modern societies means that many themes have fragmented.That is also the case with antisemitism. This makes the analysis of contemporary antisemitism far more difficult than that of historic antisemitism. Even the widely accepted antisemitism definition of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) covers only part of what Jew- or Israel-haters say or do.The foremost antisemite in the United States is probably Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam. He has called Judaism a 'gutter religion' and a 'religion of Satan.' Farrakhan has also used the word 'termite' to describe certain Jews. He has called Hitler a 'great man.' Farrakhan joined students in Tehran in 2018 shouting 'Death to Israel,' and 'Death to America.'Nevertheless, Farrakhan has on occasions said that he doesn't attack all Jews. He, albeit marginally, doesn't qualify as a full-time antisemite.One cannot describe former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn as a full-time antisemite either. He regularly states that antisemitism is vile and may not even hold any of the anti-Jewish prejudices that the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) used in its global survey. It is, however, clear that he is a part-time antisemite. The Louis Farrakhan problem[14] This admiration of Farrakhan by popular cultural figures gives him the kosher stamp of approval. Millions of Americans take what he says seriously. This is an obvious problem which people do not want to discuss for obvious reasons. It's a deadly problem. Last year, the machete-wielding psycho who went on a murderous rampage in a New York rabbi's home was apparently an avid fan of Farrakhan. During the past few years, Orthodox Jews in New York have been the target of numerous attacks by black perpetrators. How many of them were influenced by Farrakhan?It's no wonder the official Black Lives Matter statement of principles includes condemnation of only one foreign country: Israel. Black Lives Matter rallies have desecrated synagogues and chanted anti-Israel slurs.Where are the black leaders and politicians calling out Farrakhan and his malign influence in their community? Where are the Obamas? Where is Eric Holder? Where is Kamala Harris? Where is Stacy Abrams? Where is Lebron James? Where is Don Lemon? For that matter, where are the Jewish leaders? Besides the Zionist Organization of America's Mort Klein and a few others, there's been silence. Should anti-Semitism only be condemned when it can be blamed on white supremacists?An obscure food brand is undergoing a massive boycott because its Latino owner expressed support for Trump. Will any of Farrakhan's supporters be boycotted?We must condemn all intolerance. There cannot be a double standard. If being perceived as someone who supports racism is enough to get you ""canceled,"" then supporting the country's most popular and dangerous anti-Semite should, as well.In this time of skyrocketing anti-Semitism around the world - and with knowledge of what Jew-hatred has led to in the past - the Jewish community does not have the luxury of remaining silent about anti-Semitism for fear of being politically incorrect or somehow distracting from the Black Lives Matter movement. History is not kind to societies that ignore or excuse hatred towards Jews.Ice Cube Appears To Compare Kareem Abdul-Jabbar To Judas For Condemning Anti-Semitism[15] On Wednesday, rapper Ice Cube appeared to liken NBA Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to the Biblical Judas after Abdul-Jabbar wrote a column published in The Hollywood Reporter in which he criticized Ice Cube and other black celebrities for promoting anti-Semitism.Ice Cube tweeted, 'Shame on the Hollywood Reporter who obviously gave my brother Kareem 30 pieces of silver to cut us down without even a phone call.' On June 11, The Daily Beast noted Ice Cube's recent and not-so-recent forays into anti-Semitism, reporting that he 'offered up a dog-whistle to his 5.3 million Twitter followers: a Star of David enveloping a black cube. He posted the image above a quadriptych of similar black cubes in four places around the world: California, New York, Denmark, and Australia The image in question, what those with vivid imaginations have come to call the 'Black Cube of Saturn,' has ties to the occult—the entirely unsubstantiated idea being that it's a sign of chaos. Further, placing it inside a Star of David heavily implies that the Jewish people are stoking the flames.'Just prior to the Star of David post, Ice Cube posted a meme showing a mural by the graffiti artist Mear One that the Daily Beast said was 'clearly intended to be anti-Semitic.''Some of the older white Jewish folk in the local community had an issue with me portraying their beloved #Rothschild or #Warburg etc as the demons they are,' Mear One said of his mural.Young Israel praises ViacomCBS over Nick Cannon, asks FOX to follow suit[16] The National Council of Young Israel (NCYI) praised American television network ViacomCBS for firing celebrity and TV personality Nick Cannon after he released an antisemetic podcast that also propagated conspiracy theories, yet the group is still calling FOX, which airs another one of Cannon's shows, to follow suit.""We have spoken with Nick Cannon about an episode of his podcast 'Cannon's Class' on YouTube, which promoted hateful speech and spread antisemitic conspiracy theories,"" The New York Times quoted a ViacomCBS statement as saying.'While we support ongoing education and dialogue in the fight against bigotry, we are deeply troubled that Nick has failed to acknowledge or apologize for perpetuating antisemitism, and we are terminating our relationship with him.'NCYI is a synagogue-based Orthodox Judaism organization in the United States. Cannon released his podcasts on YouTube in June, which earlier this week, sparked the organization to ask the question of why his offensive podcast continued to remain on YouTube's platform if it violates their guidelines for hate speech, as YouTube's guidelines state that '[h]ate speech is not allowed on YouTube' and that YouTube will 'remove content promoting violence or hatred against individuals or groups based on religion.'In his ""Cannon's Class"" video podcast, Cannon interviewed ""Professor Griff"" Griffon, known for having been fired from the rap group Public Enemy in 1989 for making antisemetic remarks in an interview with The Washington Post. In the interview he reportedly said that Jews were responsible 'for the majority of wickedness that goes on across the globe.'#8216;We Are For Our People First': Diddy Defends Nick Cannon, Invites Him To Join 'Truly Black Owned' Revolt TV[17] It seems that some prominent media figures with mega-platforms have come out in defense of television host Nick Cannon after ViacomCBS fired him in response to blatantly anti-Semitic/anti-white comments.In a tweet on Wednesday, rapper and all-around music icon Diddy said that black people need to stand with Cannon and invited him to join the 'truly black-owned' Revolt TV.'[Nick Cannon] come home to [Revolt TV] truly BLACK OWNED!!!' tweeted Diddy. 'We got your back and love you and what you have done for the culture. We are for our people first!!! For us! By US! Let's go!!!'Many followers of Diddy agreed with his sentiments about Nick Cannon, who called white people 'true savages' and who suggested that black people are the 'true Hebrews.''This is finally the year for all BLACK OWNED businesses,' tweeted one follower.Charlamagne Tha God: Nick Cannon Getting Fired For Anti-Semitic Remarks Proves Jews 'Have The Power'[18] Left-wing radio host Charlamagne tha God suggested on Wednesday that ViacomCBS terminating its relationship with Nick Cannon following remarks by Cannon that were viewed as anti-Semitic and anti-white was proof that Jewish people 'have the power.''Listen, Nick is my guy,' Charlamagne tha God said. 'I hate it had to be him, but that's what you can do when you have the power. And if there's one thing Jewish people have showed us, it's they have the power.''I can't wait until the day black people are able to fire people for saying things about us that we deem racist,' he continued. 'We can barely get cops fired for actually killing us. They fired Nick for referencing a theory written by a psychologist on racism.'Right-wing pundit Candace Owens responded to Charlamagne tha God's comments by tweeting: 'I respect @cthagod, but his comment that Nick Cannon's firing proves 'Jews have the power' is off base. Did the hundreds of white people who have been fired over these past few months for disagreeing with the radical goals of black lives matter prove that we have the power?''Thousands of blacks promoted to comply with BLM,' Owens continued. 'Thousands of whites fired for disagreeing, and everyone pretended it was cool. ONE black man gets fired and now it's 'the Jews have power'? Nope.'Dwyane Wade Tells Nick Cannon To 'Keep Leading' After Cannon Fired For Racist Remarks; Wade Later Tries To 'Clarify'[19] Former NBA star Dwyane Wade voiced support for Nick Cannon on Wednesday afternoon after Cannon was terminated by ViacomCBS for making remarks that were widely deemed as anti-Semitic.Wade tweeted, '@NickCannon We are with you??? Keep leading!'Seattle-based conservative radio host Jason Rantz tweeted out a screenshot of Wade's tweet after Wade deleted the tweet a couple of hours after posting it.'After Nick Cannon was fired for his disturbing anti-Semitic vitriol, Dwayne Wade tweeted his support but then deleted the tweet,' Rantz said. 'I screenshot it below. What leadership was @DwyaneWade supporting?'Wade later claimed in a tweet that he was not expressing support or condoning Cannon's remarks.'I want to clarify my now deleted tweet,' Wade tweeted. 'I was not supporting or condoning what Nick Cannon specifically said, but I had expressed my support of him owning the content and brand he helped create.' Youtube deleted this video holding Farrakhan, and his defender Cornel West, to account. (I'm ""glorifying or inciting violence against,"" apparently, the Jews, @YouTube[20] tells me.)

I hope this sends shivers down the spines of anonymous Twitter trolls.If you don't want to be sued, don't harass or libel.

A few students recently created multiple Instagram pages, inviting fellow students and faculty to post stories about incidents of bias on campus. Those who share their stories are permitted to remain anonymous, but the students and professors accused of perpetrating bias are freely and fully identified—and targeted.One of the pages has warned their viewers to look out for 'openly Zionist' professors on campus, naming one professor in particular and attacking students who support the faculty member.Miriam F. Elman, who teaches about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, isn't the only Jewish professor who works at Syracuse, but she is openly Zionist and isn't afraid to say so. Despite being on leave for the past year, she is being singled out by a malicious and libelous smear campaign on one Instagram page that is demanding that she be fired because of her Zionism and former service in the Israeli Defense Forces. A screenshot of a tweet targeting Syracuse Professor Miriam Elman.The message for Jewish students is clear: Shed your identity or get canceled. It reeks of pure McCarthyism. The Instagram pages, ironically touting an 'inclusive' agenda with words such as 'unity,' will tolerate only those Jews who disavow Israel and shed their Zionism, which for most Jews is a major component of their faith.Adding to the irony is that the Instagram pages have inspired hardcore anti-Semites outside of their group to send hate emails to Elman's university account. Inexplicably, while the university administration has engaged in public-relations calisthenics for months to show its sensitivity to campus discrimination, they have been silent on this particular brand of hate.Brazilian hospital suspends doctor for comparing COVID-19 to Holocaust[42] A prominent Brazilian physician was suspended by Latin America's leading Jewish hospital after comparing the fear of the coronavirus pandemic to the Holocaust.Nise Yamaguchi, an oncologist and immunologist at Sao Paulo's Albert Einstein Israelite Hospital, made the comparison in an appearance on the 'Impressoes' television show on July 5. She was suspended by the hospital on Saturday after working there for 35 years.'Fear is harmful to everything,' Yamaguchi said. 'First, it paralyzes you. It makes you easy to manipulate. Anyone. Do you think that a few Nazi soldiers would be able to control the hungry Jewish herd if they did not subject them to that daily humiliation?'The suspension drew massive media coverage in Brazil. The Albert Einstein hospital is one of Brazil's strongest Jewish institutions and is considered by many to be the best hospital in all of Latin America.Yamaguchi's remarks were 'unfortunate and an unfounded analogy,' Sidney Klajner, the hospital's president, told the Correio Brasiliense newspaper. 'The Holocaust is an extremely important moment for us, where 6 million Jews were killed, and many survivors contributed to the foundation of our hospital.'The Sao Paulo Jewish federation also condemned Yamaguchi, saying she her remarks 'minimize the horrors of Nazism and offend the memory of victims, survivors and their families.'Yamaguchi apologized on Sunday, saying her comments were not never anti-Semitic, paying tribute to her late Jewish mentor, and recalling her support for her sister's conversion to Judaism.Two synagogues vandalized on same day in Sarasota, Florida[43] Two Reform synagogues in Sarasota, Florida, were vandalized with swastikas and other unspecified hateful messages.The incidents at Temple Sinai and Temple Emanu-El reportedly took place early on Wednesday morning, the Sarasota Herald-Tribune reported.The Temple Sinai campus was extensively vandalized, including many walls made of porous Jerusalem stone, making the removal of the messages difficult. It is the second time that Temple Emanu-El has been attacked in the last four months. In April, swastikas were spray-painted on the doors of the synagogue.The Sarasota Sheriff's office told the newspaper that a man was seen on surveillance video on the grounds of Temple Emanu-El at around 2 a.m. Video shows the same man on the grounds of Temple Sinai later on the same morning.PLEASE RT: Help us identify the suspect who spray-painting swastikas on two Jewish temples overnight in Sarasota. He was seen wearing a blue cap, dark shirt, jeans with red bandana covering his face. Have info? Call detectives at 941.861.4900. https://t.co/bgAtpcPFX2 — SarasotaSheriff (@SarasotaSheriff) July 15, 2020The two temples issued a joint letter on Wednesday to their memberships to inform them of the vandalism.'We will be ever vigilant in looking after the safety and security of our members and our children. But we will not allow hate to distract us from the holy work that defines our temple missions,' the letter said.'Death to Jews' and swastikas drawn on gravestones in southern France[44] About 20 gravestones in a cemetery in southern France were vandalized with swastikas and the words 'Death to Jews' and 'Death to the French.'The graffiti was discovered in the Gruissan municipal cemetery in the Aude region on Sunday.The gravestones appear to have been chosen at random and were not broken or toppled, France 3 television reported.The cemetery has been closed to the public. No suspects have been identified in the attack.The National Bureau for Vigilance Against Antisemitism, or BNVCA, in a statement condemned the desecration of the cemetery. The statement noted that the town of Gruissan is 'usually rather calm, rather peaceful, and this aggression surprises and scandalizes us.'Jews in German City of Cologne Angered by Defacing of Holocaust Memorial by Animal Rights Extremists[45] The Jewish community in the German city of Cologne was locked in a battle with animal rights activists this week, following a demonstration last weekend in which a Holocaust memorial fountain was vandalized with red dye to simulate blood, alongside slogans protesting cruelty to animals.Abraham Lehrer — the deputy chairman of the Central Council of Jews in Germany and a leader of the community in Cologne — declared in a statement that the defacement of the Löwenbrunnen children's memorial was 'an act of boundless tastelessness and a mockery of the victims of the Holocaust, especially children and young people and their surviving relatives.'Designed in 1997 by artist Hermann Gurfinkel, the memorial is located on the former site of Jawne, a Jewish school, in the center of the city. An exhibition on the history of the school is also based there.The fountain commemorates more than 1,100 Jewish children who were deported from Cologne to concentration camps during the period of Nazi rule in Germany. The names of the children are recorded on eight bronze plates at the base of the fountain.Activists associated with the 'Animal Rebellion' organization which staged the protests angrily denied that the fountain had been targeted for antisemitic reasons.

As the Holocaust worsened there, he offered to protect Jews of Spanish origin and bring them Spanish passports. He received the consent of the Hungarian authorities to enable 200 Spanish Jews to receive them, but he turned that into 200 families, and kept increasing the number, according to Yad Vashem, the Israeli Holocaust museum that recognized him as Righteous Among the Nations in 1966.It is believed that in the last seven months of 1944, Briz issued forged Spanish documents to 5,200 Jews.Thursday's tribute, which was hosted by the chief Sephardic rabbi of Buenos Aires, Isaac Sacca, was organized by Menora, an Argentine Sephardic institution, with the support of the Center Sefarad Israel in Spain, the Argentine Jewish political umbrella group DAIA and the Federation of Jewish Communities in Spain, or FCJE.Among those on hand were Sanz Briz's daughter Angela; a Holocaust survivor, Eva Bohrer; and Spain's ambassador to Argentina, Javier Sandomingo.'My father thought that what he had done in Budapest was the most important and rewarding thing in his life,' Angela Sanz Briz said after the event. 'He also considered that he had simply done his duty, that he could not look the other way. And he used all the means at his disposal to do so.''He never expected recognition or thought he had to have it.'Sanz Briz died in 1980 at 69 years old.UK-Jewish spy's pivotal role in French espionage ring revealed after 95 years[58] Just a week after the Locarno Treaties — a peace pact between Germany, Belgium, France, Great Britain, and Italy — were signed in London in 1925, the French secret police very publicly broke up a British espionage ring in the heart of Paris engaged in stealing French military secrets.Among the uncovered spies was William 'Wolf' Fisher. The details of his role in the espionage case have been secreted in British intelligence archives for nearly a century — until now. (Full disclosure: The author of this article is related to Fisher and was raised hearing tales about him.)On December 8, 1925, the French secret police arrested three British citizens, John Leather, Oliver Phillips, and Fisher, along with two young French women. The Brits were accused of, and later convicted for, recruiting the two women to spy on various naval and aviation installations.Publicly, the British government denied all knowledge of the ring; privately the British ambassador to France, Robert Crewe-Milnes, wrote that the evidence implicating the men as British spies was 'absolutely damning.'The espionage ring collapsed when one of the two French accomplices, Marthe Moreuil, was arrested and confessed to her role in stealing secrets on behalf of Great Britain.Moreuil had infiltrated French air force and naval facilities, even qualifying as a parachutist to gain access. It also emerged in court that Moreuil was Fisher's lover. The press referred to her as 'Mademoiselle Foxtrot,' claiming that she secreted documents out of French bases in her corsets. Do some cisterns in the Negev date back to the time of Abraham?[59] For many years, researchers have been puzzled by the question of how the Negev desert was home to settlements and communities in ancient times, in spite of its inhospitality and aridity. Now a group of researchers from Ben-Gurion University has, for the first time, devoted attention to the ancient cisterns scattered around the highlands of the desert - its driest region - which might hold the key to understanding some of the secrets of human life in the area several thousand years ago.As explained in a paper recently published in the Journal of Archaeological Science, among the findings of the study was that some of the simplest structures might not, as has been assumed, date back only to the Iron Age beginning around 1200 BCE, but to the previous Bronze Age, which covered over two millennia between 3500 and 1200 BCE. According to the prevalent biblical interpretation, the second millennia BCE also marked the time of the life of the Jewish patriarch Abraham, who according to the Bible journeyed through the desert on more than one occasion.'In ancient times, the combination of a semi-desert or desert climate and the presence of natural water sources encouraged populations to settle in those areas, as we see in the cases of Egypt, Mesopotamia and the Jordan Valley. However, settlement sites in the heart of a region lacking water sources like the Negev, and especially its highlands, is very surprising,' Gabriel Ore, the leading author of the paper, explained to The Jerusalem Post.'The question is, why develop methods of collecting runoff water in an environment with so few rain events in a year?' he asked. 'Why did those ancient populations invest a lot of resources in quarrying and digging water cisterns in a sparse area without natural vegetation?' The researchers analyzed different types of structures uncovered in the desert: open cisterns dug in soft clay marl and bell-shaped, small-bowl-shaped and roofed cisterns excavated in hard limestone or chalk.First Jewish kosher service launches in UAE, making Gulf food history [60] A member of the UAE's Jewish community has made culinary history with the launch of the first kosher food service in the Gulf region.As prominent Jewish leaders from around the world arrived in the UAE for interfaith events during the official Year of Tolerance last year, they sought kosher meals - food that follows traditional Jewish dietary laws.Longtime Dubai resident Elli Kriel, who provided kosher food to Jewish travelers informally over the years, noticed an increase in requests in the run-up to the Year of Tolerance and saw an opportunity.Kriel started 'Elli's Kosher Kitchen' a food delivery and catering service offering certified kosher food in February 2019, two months after the Year of Tolerance was announced.'I realized there was an opportunity to do more and in a very adventurous moment, I decided to take the plunge,' Kriel said in an interview with Al Arabiya English.'The simultaneous recognition of our community also bolstered my confidence. I don't think I would have done it before then,' she added.Two more events affirmed Elli's decision. In May, Rabbi Yehuda Sarna, a chaplain at New York University, was appointed by the Jewish Community of the Emirates as its first Chief Rabbi. In September, the UAE announced the construction of an interfaith complex in the capital Abu Dhabi that will house a Jewish synagogue, Christian church, and Islamic mosque.Mike Vigoda, founder of the legendary Mike's Place, dies[61] His many friends and musicians around the country and beyond were shocked on Wednesday to learn that Mike Vigoda, the founder of the legendary, North American-style music bar known as Mike's Place had died by committing suicide the previous evening.Born in Toronto, where he became a photojournalist, Vigoda arrived in Jerusalem in the early 1990s after covering the civil war in what was then Yugoslavia.Seeking a calmer yet soul-elevating form of income, he opened a music bar on Horkanos Street in the capital's Russian Compound, where he conducted nightly jam sessions.The place was tiny, and many of the customers were under the impression that this was Vigoda's private living room, which in a sense made it even more attractive. It was packed every night. Vigoda was not much of a businessman, and therefore chose Assaf Ganzman, who was born in Haifa but raised in Jerusalem, to be his business partner.Although he took over the business, he didn't change the name. However, he did expand, and took in his brother Gil as a partner.In 2000 Ganzman opened Mike's Place in Tel Aviv, which in April 2003 made international headlines in the aftermath of a terrorist attack that had taken place during a late-night jam session. Three people were killed and more than 50 wounded.In response to the thousands of goodwill messages and condolences from Israel and abroad, Ganzman decided to carry on.Branches of Mike's Place, which have experienced changes in venue but not in name, can now be found in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Herzliya and Eilat. Jason Alexander to host Israel Cancer Research Fund August 5 virtual gala[62] The Israel Cancer Research Fund (ICRF) will host a star-studded virtual gala on August 5 to support efforts to fund Israel's leading cancer researchers.Titled Ribbons of Hope, the gala will be hosted by American actor and comedian Jason Alexander, famous for his iconic role as George Costsanza in the TV series Seinfeld.'They say laughter is the best medicine. But you know who says that? Comedians,' Alexander said in a statement. 'The best medicine is actually the product of brilliant cancer researchers working diligently and tirelessly in labs in Israel and across the world. That's why I am so honored to contribute in some small way to this important cause.'Alexander has a history of promoting Israeli medical research. In October 2018, he hosted a gala in Los Angeles in honor of Sheba Medical Center.Other noted individuals attending the gala are famous longtime NBC broadcaster Tom Brokaw, Israeli Nobel laureate Prof. Aaron Ciechanover, musician Benji Pasek, actress Bonnie Hunt and Canadian actor Eugene Levy, among others.Israeli Singer-Songwriter Noy Merison Finds Stardom Among the CongolesePlay Video[63] Play Video[64] We have lots of ideas, but we need more resources to be even more effective.

50,/content/Bias_Incident_Lexis_1.DOCX,Newstex Blogs,2020-11-07,1407 words,,news,,JOE BIDEN WINS: 1st Syracuse University alumnus to be elected president,False,"Nov 07, 2020( The Daily Orange: http://www.dailyorange.com Delivered by Newstex) The Daily Orange is a nonprofit newsroom that receives no funding from Syracuse University. Considerdonating[1]today to support our mission. J oe Biden will become the first Syracuse University alumnus to serve as president of the United States. The former vice president defeated President Donald Trump after obtaining at least 273electoral votes with victories in battlegroundstates, including Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. 
Biden graduated from SU's College of Law in 1968 and has maintained connections[2] with the university throughout his political career. His running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-California) will be the first woman and the first person of color to serve as vice president. Biden's victory came four daysafter Election Day, as the country waited for several keystates to count a massivevolume of mail-in ballots. Almost 60 million voters opted to vote by mail in this election after states expanded mail-in and early voting options due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Associated Press, CNN and NBC News have projected Biden as the winner of the 2020 election after he secured a lead in Pennsylvania, winning the state's 20 electoral votes. Arizona, Nevada and Georgia remain too close to call, but Biden currently holds a lead in those states. The former vice president won despite the Trump campaignfiling longshot lawsuits in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia to dispute, without any evidence, the legitimacy of the ballot-counting process. Since Election Day, Trump and his campaign pushed a false narrative claiming that Democrats were 'stealing' the election — haphazardly calling forvote counts to continuein some states and to stop in others. Biden served as a Delaware senator for 36 years before he was elected in 2008 to serve as the 44th vice president alongside former President Barack Obama. He served another term as vice president to Obama in 2012.Throughout the race, Biden has based his campaign around a promise to 'build back better,' which includes restoring the economy following the coronavirus pandemic and healing political division in the country. His victory comes as COVID-19 has killed over 235,000 Americans and after protestersacross the country swept the streets this summer in the wake of thekilling of George Floyd in May. Trump has faced criticism over his response to the coronavirus, but Biden plans to expand rapid COVID-19 testing across the country and implement a national mask mandate. Biden also pledged toprovide 'clear guidance' for how schools and businesses should operate during the pandemic and a plan for an equitable distribution of vaccines. While Biden has firmly rejected calls to defund police departments, he plans to spend an additional $300 million a year on community policing initiatives and other reforms. He would also seek to decriminalize recreational marijuana but would not attempt nationwide legalization. Republicans are likely to hold on to the Senate and Democrats to the House.Biden will inherit a divided Congress, further challenging his ability to transform campaign promises into legislative actionas the country fails to overcomethe pandemic. Joe Biden visited SU in 2015 as part of his speaking tour for 'It's On Us,' a campaign to prevent sexual assault on college campuses. Daily Orange File PhotoFollowing his graduation from SU, the president-elect made several visits to the university and delivered three commencement addresses. He was the commencement speaker for the College of Law in 2006 and the keynote speaker during SU's 2009 commencement ceremony. During his second address, which came a little over a year into his term as vice president, he reflected on his experiences at SU and how they contributed to his political career. 'Since I've been in public life, there has never been a graduating class that is graduating into a moment where they actually have a chance to make more than incremental change,' Biden said in the speech. 'That's why Barack and I ran. That's why I believe so passionately we have a shot like hasn't occurred in the lifetime of anyone in this Dome. And now we're here. Imagine what we can do.' Biden visited campus again in 2015, towardthe end of his second term as vice president. During the visit, Biden spoke about preventing sexual assault and domestic violence on college campuses as part of the 'It's On Us' campaign. Biden and Obama created the campaign in 2014. The president-elect made his most recent visit to SU in 2016, when he delivered another commencement address[3] to the College of Law. During this speech, he spoke about his son Beau Biden, who died of brain cancer in May 2015. Beau Biden graduated from SU's College of Law in 1994 and delivered the college's commencement address in 2011. In November 2019, Biden said he was 'deeply disturbed'[4] by a series of racist incidents that occurred on and near campus last fall. Biden's first presidentialcampaigncollapsedin 1987 after he admitted to plagiarism, including a law review article for an essay in his first year of law school at SU.The president-elect told The New York Times in 1987 that while he made a mistake by plagiarizing, he had just misunderstood the assignment's citing requirements. Shortly after the scandal, Biden dropped out of the presidential race. Joe Biden spoke at the 2016 commencement for SU's College of Law, where both he and his late son Beau Biden earned law degrees. Daily Orange File PhotoBiden also dated and married his first wife, Neilia Hunter, during his time at SU. They lived together about three miles from SU's campus before moving to Delaware after Biden graduated. Neilia died in a car crash in 1972 that also killed the couple's infant daughter, Naomi Biden, and severely injured his two sons, Hunter and Beau Biden. During his first commencement speech at SU, Biden discussed how his life experiences taught him how to handle adversity. His victory represents a shift from Trump on many key issues, including climate change, immigration and health care. The president-elect plans to support an active federal role in reducing greenhouse gases and has introduced a $2 trillion plan to fight climate change by eliminating carbon emissions from the electric sector by 2035. Trump, however, has dismissed the science behind climate change and withdrew the country from the Paris agreement among the United Nations, which aims to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees. Biden has said he will rejoin the agreement and urge other nations to increase their commitments to the climate. Trump and Biden also significantly diverge on immigration. While Trump had built nearly 321 miles of barriers on the U.S.-Mexico border as of September, Biden has said he would immediately stop the construction of the border wall and focus his immigration policy on improving screening systems across the border. The former vice president has also said he would work to raise the limit of refugees allowed in the country. Trump limited the number to 15,000 in October, the lowest it has ever been. Biden supports the Affordable Care Act, a comprehensive health care reform law passed while Biden was serving as vice president under Obama. Trump has opposed the ACA but has yet to produce an alternative plan. The president-elect has also endorsed Dana Balter, the Democratic candidate for New York's 24th Congressional District and a former professor in SU's Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs. Balter's platform focused on progressive policies such as strengthening the Affordable Care Act and raising the minimum wage. The race between Katko and Balter remains undecided, as Balter refuses to concede until the district's nearly 70,000 absentee ballots are counted next week. https://donate.dailyorange.com/ The post JOE BIDEN WINS: 1st Syracuse University alumnus to be elected president[5] appeared first on The Daily Orange[6].

51,/content/Bias_Incident_Lexis_1.DOCX,Fair Observer,2020-08-25,954 words,,Leonard Weinberg,,Donald Trump and the 'Kung Flu',False,"Over the course of his 2016 campaign and his subsequent presidential term, Donald Trump has sought to exploit popular fears of foreigners and certain American ethnicities to his political advantage. His verbal attacks have been selective. Irish, Italian and Polish Americans, for example, have proved immune to his insults (at least in his public utterances). Trump's favorite targets for public abuse have been Hispanics, especially individuals seeking to enter the country clandestinely along the border with Mexico. He has also complained bitterly and profanely, in a semi-public setting, about immigrants from Haiti and sub-Saharan African countries.
This is hardly the end of things. Early on in his administration, Trump imposed a ban, which was overturned by courts, on all Muslims seeking to enter the United States based on popular fears of terrorism. Very much unlike his two predecessors, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, who were careful to distinguish between terrorists and the followers of Islam, Trump sought to equate Muslims in general with terrorism, thereby inflaming existing popular fears.
Classic Demagoguery
Then came COVID-19, a disease that has taken the lives of nearly 168,000 of Americans to date. After some initial hesitation, Trump labeled it ""kung flu."" To cheers and wild laughter at mass rallies and other public events, the president has sought to deflect widespread criticism of his handling of the pandemic by blaming the Chinese-not merely the government but the people in general -conflating the Chinese martial art of kung fu with influenza to the delight of his followers.
All this, of course, is classic demagoguery intended to mobilize Trump's base of whites with less than a college education and win him their renewed support at the polls in November. The fact that he actually appears to believe what he is saying adds to the appeal of his message.
Trump's demagogic appeals have consequences for those targeted by his abuse. Using data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Report and the Bureau of Justice Statistics' National Crime Victimization Survey, researchers have reported a substantial decline in hate crimes committed against Asian Americans over the periods 2003-07 and 2014-18. Asian Americans appeared to be well on their way to acceptance by their fellow citizens. The arrival of COVID-19 arrested this development and turned it around. So that, for example, in the three months ending on July 1, another source reported over 800 discrimination and harassment incidents, including 81 assaults, aimed at Asian Americans in California alone.

The situation of American Muslims is somewhat different. For members of this religious minority, there was no reversal of the trend toward greater acceptance, simply a continuation of widespread animus. Illustratively, as reported in The Daily Beast, in the two months following the murder of 51 Muslim worshippers at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, on March 15, 2019, by Brenton Tarrant, a young Australian man who reported being a ""fan"" of Trump, mosques in San Diego, California, New Haven, Connecticut, and Queens, New York, became the targets of arson attacks.
These crimes were simply the most menacing of some hundreds of anti-Muslim hate crimes in the United States that followed upon the Christchurch killings. Abbas Barzegar, the director of a national watchdog organization that tracks anti-Muslim bias incidents, told The Daily Beast in 2019, ""We've already reported over 500 incidences of anti-Muslim bias or harassment just this year so far."" Barzegar went on to say that the uptick in anti-Muslim events began in 2015 and continued unabated thereafter.
Poisonous Atmosphere
For how much of this is Trump responsible? The answer is not easily quantifiable, but at a minimum, we can say Trump has done little to qualm the poisonous atmosphere in the country. At a maximum, we can claim he has sought to promote a politics of inter-group hatred to advance his career and improve his chances of reelection.
There is a striking contradiction in this situation. As Trump and his base insult or, in some cases, physically assault Chinese Americans and Muslims, holding the Chinese responsible for COVID-19, individual members of such now stigmatized groups have been busy trying to save Americans from the disease. A long list of Chinese American epidemiologists, emergency room physicians and virologists, led perhaps by Dr. David Ho (director of the Aaron Diamond Research Center at Columbia University) and Dr. Thomas Tsai (Brigham and Women's Hospital), have been playing vital roles in fighting the disease, often at the risk of their own lives.
About the same applies to America Muslims from both the Middle East and South Asia. The list here would have to include Dr. Ashish Jha (director of Harvard Global Health Institute), Mahrokh Irani (Harvard Global Health Institute), Dr. Najy Masai and Dr. Imran Siddiqui. Of course, the list could be extended.
Will these performances by Chinese American and American Muslim physicians and scientists have any impact on Trump's campaign rhetoric and the bigoted perceptions of his base? Probably not. To do so would require Trump voters to link the physicians' backgrounds to the groups to which they belong and modify their attitudes accordingly - not an easy feat. Further, the president and his campaign operatives have too much invested in his crowd-pleasing rhetoric to change at this late date.",Bias Incident
52,/content/Bias_Incident_Lexis_1.DOCX,States News Service,2020-09-16,8880 words,,States News Service,,TRANSCRIPT: MAYOR DE BLASIO HOLDS MEDIA AVAILABILITY 09/16/2020,False,"The following information was released by the office of the Mayor of New York:
September 16, 2020
Mayor Bill de Blasio : Good morning, everybody. Well, we all know the last six months we've been through so much in this city. Coronavirus has touched every single family and has, in so many ways, upended lives. And we talk every day here about the health reality about fighting back against this disease, making this city safer and healthier all the time, helping to bring us back in a way that emphasizes health and safety. So, let's talk today about the people we're depending on the people who have been heroes throughout this process, our City workforce, our public servants, the people who have stood up for this city through thick and thin, put us in a position now to be the envy of the nation in terms of the battle against the coronavirus. One of the lowest infection rates anywhere in America and our public workers have led the way. And our public workforce is crucial to restarting the city and moving us forward. We have so much to do, and yet we are also facing an unprecedented budget challenge. Literally unprecedented.
Now, I have to tell you, here we are in the middle of September, I couldn't have imagined no action by Washington, D. C. up to this point. I could not have imagined. Honestly, if you go back to May, June, July, I thought it was an article of faith that there would be a federal stimulus. There hasn't been, and I see no indication there will be for the remainder of this year. I truly believe that our colleagues in Albany would have acted by now on long-term borrowing. I still believe that can happen and hopefully very soon. But right now, we don't have that support and we have to keep making tough choices to move the city forward, to keep our budget balanced. That's the law, something we have to do, but also protect our workforce at the same time.
Now, I'll tell you something over the last seven years, we've proven that you can be fiscally responsible and make investments in this city that reach working people, that reach every neighborhood, all five boroughs; can invest in the public workforce and you get so much back for that investment. And there's so many indicators of that. Look, at the investments in our Health + Hospital system. Look how crucial that was when this crisis came in terms of protecting New Yorkers and then allowing us to come back. Look at the investments we've made in our children through initiatives like pre-K, 3-K. Look at how much that has yielded for this city. The investments that we have made consistently to improve life in the city, also before this pandemic gave us the strongest economy we've ever had and helped us to keep moving forward. So, we've got to protect our investments while at the same time being fiscally responsible, that's the balance we've always struck.
And we decided to create record reserves, put aside money constantly to prepare for a crisis. We never knew this would be that crisis, but we were ready with huge unprecedented fiscal reserves. We created a new Capital Stabilization Reserve to give us further protection. We found billions of dollars in savings every year, including health care savings, working with our partners in labor. All this work happened years and years before the pandemic and all this work continues right now and will continue in the future. So, in the worst days of this pandemic also was the time we have to put together the budget for the year we're in now. We achieved the largest savings plan in the history of this administration. We continued to find billions and billions of dollars in new savings. This current fiscal year budget is $7 billion less than what had been projected in February. And, look, even with the crisis we saw in the years leading up that New York City was regarded by the larger financial community as a very smart bet. In fact, our bond rating was increased last year, upgraded. So, we have to remember that all those strengths have been historic, and we will continue to build on them. In fact, we find new ways continually. We actually created a rainy-day fund, something no previous administration had ever done. So, we keep layering year after year, these additional protections.
But now dealing with the biggest jolt to our lives, to our families, to our neighborhoods, to our economy, to our budget that we have seen in generations. We lost $9 billion in revenue. And that's why, as I said, it led to a $7 billion cut in this year's budget. And a constant focus on finding additional savings and efficiencies, and we will be talking about this constantly from now until the last day of this administration. Now, look, we've already had to make some tough cuts that have affected the city and the services we provide. We're trying to do everything we can to stop from those cuts becoming worse. We do not want to take away jobs from public employees. We do not want to take away services from communities that need it. We're going to try and do everything we can and keep fighting for that stimulus from Washington, keep fighting for that long-term borrowing from Albany, but also keep making additional moves here. So, the Mayor's Office has focused my office directly, the people who worked directly for me here in City Hall and in the offices that make up the Mayor's Office, we focused on savings. And over the previous budgets, we found $12 million in savings within our budgets. We've had a hiring freeze, we've had constant focus on downsizing teams, wherever appropriate. And today is a day where we have to take another step. So, I'm announcing that as of October 1st every Mayor's Office employee will be taking a furlough. And that obviously it includes myself.
This is something I want to be clear about. Everyone will be taking a week's furlough. This is a step you never want to see for good hardworking people. The folks who work here throughout this crisis, they have not been working 35- or 40-hour weeks, they've been working 80-hour weeks, 90-hour weeks, 100-hour weeks because they believe in this city and they've been fighting for all of you. So, it is with pain that I say they and their families will lose a week's pay, but it's something we have to do. It's something I have to do. And with these furloughs and with the additional savings and cuts that we achieved in the June budget, the Mayor's Office budget will now be 12 percent less this fiscal year than it was last fiscal year. So, we're showing that at the very top of the operation more important actions are being taken every day and that we will make the choices we have to, to keep this city going forward. But, again, I want to thank all of the folks who do this work, and it was not a decision I made lightly to have to do this, it is painful for them and their families, but it is the right thing to do at this moment in history. Now, we'll keep fighting for those bigger changes. And I want to ask every New Yorker to join in that fight, pushing your federal representatives to help us get that stimulus, pushing your representatives in Albany for that long-term borrowing. We need to find bigger solutions, but this is another step today to find every answer we can right here within the City government.
Let me talk today about another challenge that we have faced. And as I said, this crisis, the coronavirus has affected every neighborhood, every person, every family, and it's had a lot of different impacts, health, first and foremost, the people we've lost, the families who have gone through pain, but it's not just the horrible losses within families or the people who have lost jobs, it's also that we've seen something very ugly, very negative throughout this crisis. And that's discrimination, hatred, bias directed at our Asian American communities. And so wrongly, so unfairly. These are communities that contribute so much to this city. Our Asian American communities are part of what make New York City great. In fact, sadly communities in this city in places like Chinatown, Flushing, Queens, and Southern Brooklyn, were feeling the effects of this crisis even before many other New Yorkers were because they were suffering discrimination.
People wouldn't go to their stores or the restaurants, that was painfully wrong. And I tried to show through my own actions that that kind of discrimination was wrong and wasn't acceptable and wasn't consistent with the values of the city, but we still see, unfortunately, hate crimes directed towards Asian Americans. We see verbal attacks, physical attacks. We see people blaming a community here for a virus that originated far away, and that people here had nothing to do with at all. And yet, somehow, they're being blamed and that's unacceptable. We will not allow it and we'll fight back against it. So, that's why the NYPD has created a permanent Asian Hate Crimes Task Force. That's dedicated to working with the community to make sure every attack, every incident of bias is reported, and acted on. The best way to stop these things, besides educating people and leading by example, is to show that there will be consequences, and how the NYPD is devoted to this work. And I want you to hear about the details from the leader of the Asian Hate Crime Task Force, NYPD Deputy Inspector Stewart Loo.
Deputy Inspector Stewart Loo, NYPD : Thank you, Mayor de Blasio. Good morning. I'm Deputy Inspector Stewart Loo of the NYPD's newly formed Asian Hate Crime Task Force. It's an honor for me to be here today to talk about something and announce something that I find very special and positive. If I may, I'd like to start with a quick quote from Martin Luther King that I found relevant to current events and today's topic. ""Darkness cannot drive out darkness. Only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate. Only love can do that."" And yet too often today's times we see actions and rhetoric filled with hate and discrimination only to be [inaudible] with using more hate and more discrimination. I think we all stand to benefit by reflecting on the wisdom and the work of Martin Luther King, Jr. To touch on what the Mayor said, COVID-19 has had a tremendous impact on all of us. It's affected our health. It's affected our finances. It's affected our overall well-being. Some of us have even lost loved ones, but it's been a little worse for the Asian American community. Since the pandemic, Asians have faced a concerning increase in unprovoked racist, verbal attacks, some of them leading to physical assaults. They have become victims of crimes for no reason other than the fact that they are of a certain race. This is the impetus for the formation of the Asian Hate Crime Task Force.
There are many unique obstacles in helping an Asian crime victim, whether it's language barrier, cultural differences, fear of retaliations, general reluctance of making a report, or distrust of the police. This task force will bridge that gap. And we have already done so successfully on a number of occasions. Just to be clear, this task force is a support unit under the overall Hate Crimes Task Force Commander Mark Molinari, which investigates all hate crimes. Underneath him, the Asian Hate Crime Task Force is myself, two captains, two sergeants, and 25 of the world's greatest detectives, skilled and dedicated Asian American investigators who are fluent in a variety of languages, including Mandarin, Cantonese, Korean, [inaudible] Tagalog. Okay. And more important, to help solve these crimes, the task force serves two purposes. The first one is it brings awareness to the problem awareness leads to education, which I believe ultimately will lead to prevention. And the second one, it sends a clear message, a clear message from the leadership of this city and that messages that we support justice. We know the hardship you're going through. We care and we are doing something about it. So, I encourage anyone who is a victim, or knows someone who's a victim of a hate crime or any crime for that matter to come forward so we can help prevent this from happening again. The only thing right now, that's more contagious than COVID is hate. So, I ask everyone to do their part and stop the spread. Thank you.
Mayor : Thank you so much, Deputy Inspector. I want to thank you and the whole team you're working with for the great work you're doing, it's such an important work. And Deputy Inspector, you heard the passion with which he spoke about this work, but he also in describing the members of his team and all the languages they speak, the rich heritage they bring to this work, it's a reminder of today's NYPD that represents every community of this city. That is a more and more diverse force reaching deep into communities with a strategy of neighborhood policing. And this fits perfectly the strategy. We want to be shoulder to shoulder with Asian American communities fighting hate, and the NYPD is leading the way. So, Deputy Inspector, thank you for your great work and thank you for invoking the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. because that's one of his most powerful quotes, because it reminds us, as angry as we get, when we see hatred and bias, we have to overcome it with something more positive, and we do need to educate, we do need to change hearts and minds. So, another important initiative to fight against prejudice, to fight against racism, to fight against bias is being created by our Office for the Prevention of Hate Crimes.
This is another part of the Mayor's Office that does such important work, working with communities, working at the grass roots to help educate everyone, but particularly our young people. And so a new contest, and it's a beautiful one, it's called Heart Work Against Hate. And the idea is to invite young people, to submit positive messages, positive images, ideas that will help us create respect and unity in this city. It's the most diverse place on earth, where there is a lot of sense of common cause especially now, as we fight this virus. We've got to keep showing those positive messages, messages of love will win the day. And so we're inviting these young people to submit their best ideas, their messages, and then we'll choose some that will be showcased on the office's website. And we'll use social media to spread the word all over the city. We're going to let the youth of this city speak to the future. We want to let them speak about the city they want to create, in a city that works for everyone.
Okay, let me switch gears now a couple of things I want to say that relate to again, our public workforce and the important work they do. So, we have more work to do, even with huge budget constraints, we have more work to do to keep working on the quality of life every day in this city. And we know with a tight budget that it's been tough in terms of what we've seen in some of our streets and parks. And, we want to improve the cleanliness level. So, we will be restoring approximately 65 litter basket pickup trucks through the Sanitation Department every week. That'll be a 24 percent increase over current levels. And that Sanitation the Economic Development Corporation they'll restart a great initiative, it's called Clean NYC, working with the DOE Fund. A lot of you have seen out there, good, good men and women out there turning their own lives around, but doing great work, helping communities to be clean. We're going to be extending that effort in a number of neighborhoods and parks around the city. So, those efforts, and we've found some additional changes that we've made in our budget to allow for those. But we're also recognizing there's a lot of people beyond the City government, a lot of community-based organizations, elected officials, a lot of folks in the private sector are sponsoring their own cleanup efforts with their own employees or with volunteers from the community. And that's fantastic. I'm seeing that happen more and more all over the city. Want to thank everyone who's doing community cleanups. We need your help. We're going to keep doing everything we can to get the most done from the public sector, but everyone else who is contributing, it makes a huge difference. And, of course, I want to thank all the good men and women at the Sanitation Department who do this work every day for us. No matter what the situation they're always there for us. I remember after Sandy, the heroic role they played bringing back the city. I remember what has happened in snowstorm after snowstorm. Whatever's thrown at the Sanitation Department, they respond and they're going to help us through this crisis as well.
And while I'm thanking and appreciating public workers, these folks don't work for the City of New York, but they sure do serve every one of us, our postal workers, everyone who's part of the United States Postal Service. Thank you. You know what? We need you more than ever. You, in fact, are not only our lifelines for so many people, you bring medicines, you bring the resources that people will wait on regularly when they need help. You bring information. You keep families united. The work you do is absolutely precious. And dare I say, you are also guardians of democracy because more and more people are going to be casting their votes through you. So, to all of you, thank you. Thank you for everyone who works for the postal service. There may be all sorts of debates and controversies in Washington, but here on the ground in New York City, we just appreciate all of you and we need you, and we're going to do everything we can to help you be strong.
Okay, let's go to our daily indicators. Number one, daily number of people admitted to New York City hospitals for suspected COVID-19 that threshold is 200 patients, and today's report is 75, with a confirmed positive rate for COVID amongst those patients of 11.54 percent. Number two, new reported cases on a seven-day average, that threshold 550, today's report 277 cases. And number three, percentage of people testing citywide positive for COVID-19, threshold is five percent, today's report 0.87 percent. A good number thanks to all of you. Few words now in Spanish
[Mayor de Blasio speaks in Spanish]
With that, we'll turn to our colleagues and the media. Please let me know the name and outlet of each journalist.
Moderator: Hey guys, we'll now begin our Q-and-A. As a reminder, we're joined today by Deputy Mayor Laura Anglin, Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza, OLR Commissioner Renee Campion, Deputy Inspector Mark Molinari, Deputy Inspector Stewart Loo, and Senior Advisor Dr. Jay Varma. With that, our first question today goes to Hazel from WCBS.
Question: Good morning, Mr. Mayor. How are you?
Mayor: How's it going, Hazel?
Question: Good, good. I have a question for you and for Chancellor Carranza. We were at P.S. 63 on the Lower East Side yesterday, where we found classrooms with broken windows, others that wouldn't open more than maybe three inches or the windows were screwed shut, and they had very poor ventilation. Now, these are classrooms that teachers tell me they reported for poor air circulation years ago, issues before a COVID-19, yet these classrooms were given a passing grade by the ventilation action team and students will be in these classrooms on Monday. Now, we've received similar complaints from several other schools. We had a teacher literally in tears yesterday, worried about students and teachers getting sick and getting a family sick. So, my question is, will the City go back to P.S. 63 and other schools and fix these issues in classrooms where teachers feel the inspections were flawed?
Mayor: Hazel, I appreciate you telling me about this. I don't want to see any classroom online that shouldn't be. If a classroom isn't ready for our kids and our educators, it shouldn't be used. So, we will absolutely send the team back to P.S. 63 today to see exactly what happened. And if any classroom is not up to snuff, it'll be taken out of circulation immediately. And it will not be used until it is fixed. So, I welcome any reports, anything that needs to be fixed we will either be able to fix it immediately in time for Monday or we will not use that room until it is fixed. It's as simple as that. Go ahead.
Question: My second question that's the principal's union still saying 2,000 additional teachers is not enough. Some teachers are now concerned that they're being assigned to teach subjects they've never taught before. For example, teachers finding out PE teachers finding out they're now teaching math, and they just have a few days before school starts and little time to prepare. How do you respond to the critics that say, this won't be the best education for New York City public school students?
Mayor: Look, Hazel, I've been around our public schools a long time as a parent, as a public servant, and I can tell you that there's constantly adjustments that have to be made, but this year more than ever, because we're in a pandemic. And we're asking everyone to use their skills, their talents to help our kids. Of course, people are only going to be asked to do things they can do. We're not going to ask people to do things they can't do, but we are going to ask everyone to dig down deep to serve our children. Our children are hurting, Hazel. They have missed months and months of in-person instruction last year, they've been through a lot of trauma, they need the support of educators, they need positive adult role models, they need people to help them. And I have not met a single person in our labor unions or anywhere else who says that we can serve our children as well remotely as we do in-person. And we're not starting from, you know, scratch here. We're talking about kids who already have been set back months and months. So, we're only going to ask people to do what they can do, but we're going to ask them to do a lot, because our kids deserve it. Chancellor, would you like to add?
Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza: Mr. Mayor, I think you covered that right on.
Mayor: Okay. Thank you. Go ahead.
Moderator: For our next question, we'll go to Andrew from WNBC.
Mayor: Good morning, everyone. Mayor, for weeks, you've been saying that there were going to be enough educators, but our understanding and maybe we'll get the Chancellor to weigh in on this as well is that late last night, the DOE concluded there will not be enough to guarantee live instruction on the blended remote days. So, I'm wondering what you say to parents who have been told you'll get live instruction every single day and have now been told, maybe not.
Mayor: I'll start and turn to the Chancellor. Andrew, look, we are starting up a huge endeavor to serve our children and our parents. From the very beginning, parents of this city spoken said they wanted their kids back in school. And we've heard this from parents of all backgrounds, every neighborhood, every walk of life, but we've particularly heard this from parents who are less privileged, whose kids need more help, whose kids are dealing with a lot of challenges and desperately want the positive environment of the classroom again. So, we're starting on Monday. We've said repeatedly, it will not be a perfect start, we'll be making a lot of adjustments in the weeks after we begin to continue to improve things. But the important reality here is to say, we're going to start by providing the best education possible in-person, the best education possible remotely. We're going to keep making improvements as we go along, we're going to keep adjusting and figuring out what we need in terms of staffing. We've come this far. We're going to keep doing what we have to do to make it better every single day. It's not static, Andrew. It's not like what happens on the first day by the way, this is true in a typical school year what happens the first day is not the same as how things are two weeks or three weeks or four weeks later after a lot of things have been worked through. Even in a regular school year without a pandemic, they're adding staff into schools even a few weeks into the school year. So, we're going to make adjustments, but, over time, we're going to be continuing to improve the quality both in classroom and remote. Go ahead, Chancellor.
Chancellor Carranza: Yes, sir. What I would add is I would amplify what you just said. This is the start of the school year. We're going to continue to make adjustments. But also, all of the variables keep adjusting as well. How many students are in-person? How many students have chosen remote? How many of our staff members are seeking medical accommodations and what does that look like? And then, the space issue. So, there are constant variables at play here. And what we've chosen to do is be honest and transparent with the public and say to folks our goal has always been synchronous instruction every single day. But as we look at the first day and know that we're working through some of these staffing challenges, we're being honest with the public, nobody's hiding anything here. So, you're almost darned if you do and darned if you don't. But we're going to be transparent with families and let them know that this will be some of your education remotely will be asynchronous. And that can still be very rigorous assignments, very rigorous lessons that students complete. And as we continue to ramp up, as you've said, Mr. Mayor, we're going to continue to add capacity to provide and meet our goal, which has synchronous instruction every single day.
Mayor: Go ahead, Andrew.
Question: Yes, on a totally different topic. As we speak, at this moment, Former Mayor Rudy Giuliani is holding a news conference, outlining what he views to be the way to bring back the city from some difficulties right now. And specifically, what he's calling for is the hiring of 9,000 additional police officers to help deal with the rise in shootings and the homeless problem. I wonder what your reaction to that is.
Mayor: I think he has amnesia. I think he's out of touch with reality. I think we've seen more and more Rudy Giuliani become unhinged, and I'm just not waiting around to hear what he thinks. We have the greatest police force in the country. Up to this pandemic, this police force had driven down crime year after year after year. They've been dealing with a perfect storm and yet they're fighting back really valiantly. But, unlike in Giuliani's time, this police force works with the people in New York City, works with the neighborhoods, listens to people and tries to create unity and common cause with the people in the neighborhoods of the city. And that's what's going to work in the long haul.
Moderator: Next up is Michael Gartland from the Daily News.
Question: Hey, Mr. Mayor. How are you doing?
Mayor: Hey, Michael. How are you?
Question: I'm alright. So, on these furloughs you talked about at the top of the press conference, why why now? I mean, you've been talking about borrowing for months now and, you know, the fiscal hawks and, you know, some of the State lawmakers we've talked to said, you know, we need to find more savings before we take that step. So, I mean, why wait until now? Why not why not kind of take this step earlier on in the process?
Mayor: Michael, look, first of all, as I said, for months, I think many, many people, including folks who are pretty objective about politics and government thought there would be a stimulus. I think we're all shocked that hasn't happened. Based on lots of conversations with leaders in Albany and members of the Legislature, I thought they were going to move forward long-term borrowing. They did it after 9/11, they should do it now. But since it hasn't happened, were looking for every possible way to make the moves that we can make while continuing the conversations with long-term borrowing, while continue conversations with labor over savings. But, Michael, I don't think you would like it if your boss said, hey, Michael, you're going to lose a week's pay. I don't think it's something that we want to do to anyone, especially people have been working so hard. These folks have worked nonstop. A lot of the people in this building have worked every single day since the pandemic began. I don't want to take money away from them and their families, but it's at the point where we have to show that we're going to do anything and everything to get through this. Go ahead. Michael Michael?
Moderator: Do you have a second question?
Question: Can you hear me?
Mayor: There you go.
Question: Yeah. I'm sorry about that. Does it give you some leverage, moving forward? Have you gotten any feedback on that? As far as the borrowing in Albany, and as far as you know, the negotiations, I know you you've been in with labor leaders as far as, you know, figuring out some things there to find savings?
Mayor: Look, the work we're doing with labor has been going on nonstop and they've been, you know, productive and respectful conversations. I think a lot of the folks who lead our municipal unions understand this is about saving the city and our future. But we're taking this action because it's the thing we have to do now. I certainly think it says to people, you know, everyone's trying to do what they can, everyone sacrificing in some way. Let's all keep working together. I mean, I hope it does send some of that message.
Moderator: Next up is Henry from Bloomberg.
Question: Hello, Mr. Mayor. I'd like to ask you
Mayor: Go ahead.
Question: How are you doing?
Mayor: How are you doing, man?
Question: Okay. So, I'd like to ask you a couple of questions about this furlough program. Do you think you'd extend it citywide to the entire workforce? What the intent of this action today and how much money will you really save doing this?
Mayor: The amount we save by this action is somewhere in the neighborhood of a million dollars, combined with the other actions we've taken. As I said, the Mayor's Office budget is now 12 percent less this year, this fiscal year we're in now compared to the fiscal year that ended in June. I think everything's on the table to your original question, everything's on the table, Henry. We're talking to labor about any and all ways to save money. We're going to be looking at all options at this point, because, again, the things that we needed the stimulus, the long-term borrowing, they're not here. And times a-wasting, we're going to look at every option to address the situation. Go ahead.
Question: I'm wondering why you have gone this route instead of any several other ways that you could raise money that are, you know, just as draconian, perhaps, but would raise a lot more money. A one percent property tax increase, which the City has power over would raise about $750 million. It would cost the average homeowner about $75 a year. Why not look at other possibilities?
Mayor: I just don't believe a property tax increases the right thing and I won't do it. And I just won't do a property tax increase. That's off the table, period. People in this city are hurting in a way that is unprecedented. The only thing that compares, you have to go back to the great depression. The last thing we're going to ask people to do is to have to pay more working people, middle class people, struggling to keep it together and over a million people have lost their jobs. We're not going to ask them to pay more in property taxes off the table. Go ahead.
Moderator: Next up is Reema, from Chalkbeat.
Question: Hi, everyone. Good morning. I have a couple of questions. My first one is about the budget. So, obviously we know that with schools, there are new costs the City is shouldering while reopening. For example, the PPE, the cleaning supplies, but with the 20 percent of school aid being withheld from, you know, the recurring payments from the State, we know that districts outside of New York are already cutting staff and making other cuts. So, I'm wondering how is New York City able to pay for these new costs with essentially 20 percent less in payments coming in?
Mayor: Well, Reema, obviously what we get from the State is one part of the resources to go to schools. And again, our fight is going to be to make sure we do get that money, eventually. But the bigger answer to you is the team at Office of Management and Budget manages our money very carefully. A lot of other parts of the state are in a really horrible situation, and I feel for them, and they don't have a lot of flexibility. We at least have some flexibility, because our team manages our client cashflow well and we have resources that continue to come in. That's not true of a lot of other places, the way that they get their revenue is just different. But the bottom line here is, we're going to keep doing everything it takes to serve our kids well over half-a-million kids who need our help and deserve it, and parents are demanding that we serve them. And we're going to keep fighting for the long-term borrowing, we're going to keep fighting for the stimulus and all of the things that would make things right. But, in the meantime, we have to serve these kids. Go ahead, Reema.
Question: Okay. My second question is about the protocol for when somebody tests positive for the coronavirus, like a school staffer or a student or someone. So, the teachers union and the principals union both brought up [inaudible] delays in informing schools about positive tests. We know last night we got a list from the DOE about which schools so far have staffers who've tested positive. But the City's protocol says the City needs to confirm a self-reported positive case. And in the spring, we know this meant getting confirmation from DOH, which slowed down the process of closing schools at first. So, could you explain or, can somebody maybe from the Health Department explain exactly how the City is confirming tests? Like, we've heard it can take as little as minutes, but how does that confirmation process work and how is it being done any more quickly than this spring?
Mayor: I appreciate it, Reema. It is being done a lot more quickly, a lot more effectively, because we have the situation what I'd like to do, if the team here thinks we can pull it off, is get Commissioner Melanie La Rocca on the line and have Reema come back as soon as Melanie joins us, because she can give you a very precise answer to how the process is working and why it's so much quicker. I've talked it through with her, but I want you to hear it from her. It is a very different situation than March. March was horrible for everyone. We didn't even know in February that the pandemic was already spreading in the city because we didn't have testing. By the time we got into March, we had a much bigger problem than anyone knew, and we were all trying to do our best. This is a situation today where we've had six months to prepare. We have a situation room that's able within minutes to verify those tests, but I want make sure you hear it directly from Melanie. So, we'll take a timeout on Reema, get Melanie, and we'll go to the next question in the meantime.
Moderator: So, next up is Brigid from WNYC.
Question: Good morning, everybody. My first question is for the Chancellor. Chancellor Carranza, can you talk more specifically about what the DOE has done to close the digital divide over the summer to ensure that all school families will have access to internet for reliable remote learning today?
Chancellor Carranza: Sure. So, Brigid, what we've done is we've distributed over 340,000 Wi-Fi-enabled devices. We've also worked with the internet providers, and they were very helpful in March by providing free Wi-Fi service for students in temporary housing, low-income students, etcetera. We are working with them to continue that service to our city during this academic year as well. But in addition, we've also purchased some hotspots a good number of hotspots. I believe that number we'll verify it, but it's over 40,000 of these hotspots that we are also assigning to students that we know don't have internet connectivity as well. We've also set up on our website, a place where students or families can go and indicate that they need a device or they need internet connectivity. Also, they can call 3-1-1. And then, I know that our schools, as they're preparing for the start of the school year, have reached out to families and students to make sure that they do have a device, they do have kind connectivity. And if they don't, then we're in communication with them to provide them those either devices or connectivity.
Mayor: Just a quick follow-up on that Brigid. This is, you know, we've been through a horrible crisis, but even in the midst of crisis something striking happened where everyone pulled together. DOE did an amazing job mounting this effort to get devices and internet service to hundreds of thousands of kids that didn't have it. They did that within a matter of weeks. A lot of companies really stepped up and helped us in that. It was an extraordinary effort in the midst of crisis, but it also ended up being one of the biggest efforts in New York City history to address the digital divide. And really one of the most profound actions that's ever been taken to address the digital divide. So even in the midst of crisis, something positive happened and I really want to credit the Chancellor's team for what they did to pull that together. Go ahead, Brigid.
Question: And for the Mayor and the Chancellor. I know we've talked some about this this morning, but of course we're still hearing from schools that they haven't gotten the additional staff that they need despite, you know, this thing 2,000 teachers are arriving. We know it's the beginning and things will evolve, but I'm wondering where some of these are [inaudible] when they're were arriving and how are you keeping track of the schools that have these needs?
Mayor: I'll start and turn to the Chancellor. One thing that this Chancellor did and I give him a lot of credit for it. He created a much stronger system. First Deputy Chancellor, Executive Superintendent, superintendents, a really smart system for having leadership that connects down to the grassroots and backup to the Chancellor. So that system is working every day, determining exactly what each school needs. Again as the Chancellor said, as you get different numbers coming in about which students will be where et cetera. As I said yesterday, we have hundreds of schools that now are reporting that they do have what they need. We have others that definitely need at least a handful, more teachers. Those teachers are being assigned. They're arriving today, tomorrow, the next day, some will arrive even on Monday, but honestly that happens even in a regular school year. But that's going to be constant. And if we identify greater needs, I've said it before. I'll say it again really clearly. If we need to go beyond those 2,000, if it turns out there are additional needs and we've gotten all the folks that we have in the DOE who are classroom ready and they're all out in their assignments. If we need to go deeper into our substitute pool, we will. There's thousands and thousands of substitutes ready to go and we can bring them on and we can bring them on in a longer term manner. So whatever that true number is, as we keep working school by school to define the final need, they will get what they need. Go ahead, Chancellor.
Chancellor Carranza: I would only add sir, that the superintendents are working very closely with schools. So we are monitoring what the actual needs are of schools in terms of staffing as they're putting their models together. And I mentioned earlier in another response about all of the changing variables that principals are having to juggle with right now from enrollment to accommodations, et cetera. So superintendents are really the vehicle by which they're communicating that up to us from a human capital perspective. And then as you said, we're assigning licensed personnel to be in schools. And that's a process that's been going on this week. We've narrowed the list of schools that have some really difficult staffing challenges, and we're obviously concentrating on them. But as was also mentioned one of the variables is that teachers have to be teaching in their area of expertise. So all of those things are happening as we speak and will continue to happen even after the first day as the new school year gets started.
Mayor: Excellent.
Moderator: Next up is Luis from New York [Inaudible].
Mayor: Luis? Luis, can you hear me?
Moderator: Luis, we are waiting for you?
Mayor: I'm not sure he can hear us. Do we have, in the meantime, do we have Melanie La Rocca on?
Moderator: We do not have Commissioner La Rocca, almost. In the interim
Mayor: Okay. We're getting all these pieces will come together like a ballet. Okay. Luis, can you hear me? Why don't we go to the next person and bring back Luis as well?
Moderator: In the interim, we'll go to Abu from Bangla Patrika.
Mayor: Abu, can you hear me?
Question: Yes.
Mayor: There you go. How are you doing? How's it going?
Question: Good. How are you?
Mayor: Good.
Question: Okay. My question is as you mentioned, the hate crime and all this stuff going on, as you know, the highest office of the nation and the [inaudible] the United States is telling this disease, Chinese disease he's calling again a Chinese disease and you are telling about the discrimination And stop the discrimination. What is your comment on it? And do you talk too many times to the president I know we know it's a strained relation between you and the president, but did you ever tell him to stop Chinese disease, calling it Chinese disease?
Mayor: You know Abu, the times I've talked to the president, honestly, were in the very height of the crisis and I was trying to get us medical supplies and PPE and testing. So that was the focus then. I also think, unfortunately, this president is making a very conscious choice. When he says something as awful as that Abu, it's a purposeful effort to divide. It is part of a political strategy. There's been a lot of demagogues over time who have tried to divide people ethnically and racially and by religion. And it's unfortunately a very, very old part of human life that there are people who will do that, no matter how painful it is, no matter how wrong it is. So no, I don't think anyone's going convince him this is a guy who remember back in the 1980's called for the execution of the Central Park Five. Even though they were innocent, he wanted these young men executed. Thank God they are alive and well today and out of prison. In fact, it was this administration that settled that case once and for all. But no, he's not going to change. And he just has to be defeated. Go ahead.
Question: Also, my question is since coronavirus happened the [inaudible] ICE, you know, they paused deportation, but they announced again, aggressively deporting people. Catching the people and deporting. And New York City is a sanctuary city, what kind of assistance you are going to provide the people who need you know the help?
Mayor: Yeah. I'll tell you Abu, it's a great question. And I do think despite the bluster, and we see this pattern constantly coming from the president and from Washington of all the horrible things they're going to do to us, that never happened. Of all, you know, they're going to have massive raids, all these things they threatened that they don't do. And thank God they don't do them because they're wrong and they're counterproductive. And they would hurt people. It would be bad for this city in this country. But what we've seen in reality is that people in our immigrant communities, I really believe have heard the message that New York City is a place that respects all immigrants, regardless of documentation status. That our police department, our school system, our public hospitals, none of them will allow ICE agents on their property. The NYPD will not ask documentation status. We provide the legal support for free to folks who are immigrants who are endangered. We want to keep families together. We hate when families are separated as part of what again, ICE has become a political wing of the Trump administration in so many ways. So I do think that message has spread deeply in our immigrant communities. And people know they will get help and respect. And even things like the way we provide support, we've been providing free food to everyone, regardless of documentation status. We provide free health care. Our guaranteed health care initiative is for all New Yorkers, regardless of documentation status. Hundreds of thousands of people who legally are not allowed to have health insurance, they still can get health care for free through Health + Hospitals. I think a lot of folks feel that, and they know they are respected and protected here. Okay, let's go back and see, who do we have now?
Moderator: Do we have Commissioner La Rocca on? We're going to go shortly to Luis from New York Gold.
Question: Can you hear me?
Mayor: There you go. It's all working.
Question: Okay, great. Thank you. Hey there, Mr. Mayor. Regarding street fairs, I spoke with one of the city's largest organizers the other day, and he backed up that what you said to me a month ago. That is these folks are mostly interested in what's best for New York City. And that's a good thing, right? So Mr. Mayor, even though you haven't specifically referenced it lately, I figured the regular street fairs are a no go at this point? But as any thought been given to the holiday fairs and markets?
Mayor: It's a very good question, Luis. Basically I think you're right and I'll check on the latest in terms of our announcements, but in general, as every month has passed we've made the decision not to extend the kind of permits that existed in the past, because we can't have those kinds of gatherings. We need to keep streets clear for a lot of other things that are happening. So, and I think what we've seen overwhelmingly is folks who used to do different events, prefer themselves to do something different, something virtual or something alternative, or just to cancel for a year. The vast majority of organizations, their focus is coming back next year, hopefully in a much better environment. So we will say more on those kinds of holiday markets soon, but I think what's fair to say is everything is going to be decided based on the data and the science and, you know, health and safety first. And we got to be really careful with anything like that. Go ahead.
Question: Okay. So about keeping the streets clear, you mandated that city space be prioritized for outdoor dining and Open Streets, just as you said. And yet you've stated that outdoor dining would be taking place again next year. So, sir, I asked you as long as our health metrics are just as good, if not better than those of today, can you assure the street fair organizers and the thousands of participating merchants that your administration will work towards helping them get up and running in 2021?
Mayor: I can say this, what we've learned from this whole crisis is to make decisions based on the data and the science. That's going to be what determines everything. I do believe as you indicated that we should have Open Restaurants next year. That's the plan, that's were we are going. I think it should be made permanent. I think Open Streets has been a great success. We should be doing that every summer. And combining them has been an extraordinary success. We should do that every summer. I think that's the future of New York City. In terms of the street fairs, we've got to just make sure the time is right. So my hope is that you'll see a vaccine by spring and it is, you know, distributed and people are vaccinated by a late point in the spring, hopefully at the latest maybe even sooner. And then that season, when you see a lot of the big events in the summer, that we will be back to normal. That's my hope, but I don't want to assure anything until we get a lot closer. But I certainly want folks who have those street fairs to understand, like all the folks who have the great events in this city, our goal is to see them back next summer. Go ahead.
Moderator: For our final question, we're going to go back to Reema because we're now joined by Commissioner La Rocca.
Mayor: Do we have Reema? Reema can you hear me?
Question: Yes, I can. Thank you.
Mayor: Why don't you restate your question and then we'll have Commissioner La Rocca answer it.
Question: Okay, great. Sorry. My internet is spotty. So if I go out, just let me know. Okay. Commissioner, thanks so much for coming on. So my question was, you know, the teachers union and principals union have brought up concerns about delays in informing schools about positive coronavirus tests. The City's protocol says the City needs to confirm a self-reported positive case, but we know in the spring, this meant getting confirmation from DOH, which slowed down the process of closing schools. So can you explain how exactly the City is confirming tests this time around? Like, we've heard it can take as little as a minutes. And just how is it being done any more quickly this time around?
Commissioner Melanie E. La Rocca, Department of Buildings: Sure thing. Thank you for the question. So we put together an actual literal space. So we have DOHMH, our Test and Trace colleagues, DOE in a space. We're doing inputting calls from principals. So we want to get principals on the phone with us. So we're talking with them, understanding exactly the scenario. And then once we've got the basics of the information, we're passing that along in the system to DOHMH. DOHMH actually has a team that they've assembled, who are doing nothing but verifying the cases we're sending to them. So this team is dedicated. They're onsite and they are doing this all day throughout our hours. So we're open 5:30 to 9:30, Monday through Friday. And 11:00 AM to 9:00 PM on Sundays. That's all that team is doing. So we are putting ourselves in a place where we are ensuring that we have faster turnaround from our colleagues in DOHMH.
Mayor: Let's stay there for a second Commissioner, 5:30 AM to 9:30 PM, correct?
Commissioner La Rocca: That's correct. Monday through Friday and 11:00 AM to 9:30 PM on Sunday. And so we, again, we very much encourage our principals to contact us. They've -- we've shared the information on how to reach this room. This is really a tool that is meant explicitly for principals to help guide them through the process. Now, we know that principals have lots of questions. That's why our team is there. We want to get them the answer. And the answer may not always be that the case is a verified case. But that's what our job is. We're going to get them answers to the questions they have.
Mayor: And you had nine confirmed cases yesterday?
Commissioner La Rocco: Correct.
Mayor: Okay. And just one more to finish up on Reema's question. I think the original question was about the turnaround time? How long it takes Department of Health to confirm when you've been sent the documentation on a test? How long does it take for that situation room and the people in the situation room to confirm a positive test?
Commissioner La Rocca: Sure. So, we know for New York City residents, the turnaround time is quick. It can be a matter of you know, tens of minutes. So, we know this is a very quick turnaround and we know that the dedicated team they've put in place is ensuring that.
Mayor: So Reema, the answer to your question is minutes. The whole system is predicated on the verification of the test being as quickly as humanly possible, in many cases, just a few minutes. And then immediately taking the next steps. And we need that to go very fast. And that's why we have a situation room that's supposed to make those decisions immediately, act on them. And we have one person in charge and that's Commissioner La Rocca, who is someone who knows how to make decisions quickly to her great credit.
Okay. Everyone, as we close up, look, I just want to say you see a lot of people pulling together. You see a lot of people doing whatever it takes. You heard just then that situation room, making sure that there's action to keep our students safe and our educators, our school staff safe. That's an operation going from 5:30 in the morning to 9:30 at night. Folks are there nonstop to make sure that you're safe, your family's safe. The folks who worked for the City are sacrificing all the time because they believe in this city. The folks here at City Hall, I've been amazed. People worked again every single day since the crisis began. Our first responders, our health care heroes, our educators, the selflessness, the sacrifice that you see among our public workers is outstanding. We're going to be making some other sacrifices here at City Hall as I announced earlier. But this is what we all do. We are here to serve the public. We're going to do whatever it takes. And that's how we're going to see ourselves through this crisis. That's the spirit of this city. We're going to do what it takes to bring this city back. And I guarantee you, this city is coming back and coming back strong. Thank you, everyone.",Bias Incident

ALBERTVILLE, France — Armed with assault rifles and wearing balaclavas, dozens of police officers raided four apartments recently in a sprawling complex in Albertville, a city in the French Alps. They confiscated computers and cellphones, searched under mattresses and inside drawers, and took photos of books and wall ornaments with Quranic verses.
Before the stunned families, the officers escorted away four suspects for “defending terrorism.”
“That’s impossible,” Aysegul Polat recalled telling an officer who left with her son. “This child is 10 years old.”
Her son — along with two other boys and one girl, all 10 years old — was accused of defending terrorism in a classroom discussion on the freedom of expression at a local public school. Officers held the children in custody for about 10 hours at police stations while interrogating their parents about the families’ religious practices and the recent republication of the caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad in the magazine Charlie Hebdo.
The fifth-grade classmates are among at least 14 children and teenagers investigated by the police in recent weeks on accusations of making inappropriate comments during a commemoration for a teacher who was beheaded last month after showing the cartoons in a class on freedom of expression.
As France grapples with a wave of Islamist attacks following the republication of the Charlie Hebdo caricatures, the case in Albertville and similar ones elsewhere have again raised questions about the nature of the government’s response. It has already been criticized, inside and outside France, for actions and statements that have risked conflating ordinary French Muslims with people accused of extremism.
President Emmanuel Macron has fiercely rejected this criticism, blaming some Muslim and Western nations for failing to understand France’s deep-rooted secularism, known as laïcité. In an interview with a media columnist for The New York Times, Mr. Macron complained about what he saw as the world’s lack of support for France amid recent attacks and accused the American news media, including the Times, of “legitimizing this violence.”
To dispel misunderstanding, he invited journalists with questions on France to “call me. Call my team, call the ministers.’’ But after initially agreeing to an interview request for this article, the education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, declined Friday through a spokeswoman to speak, saying that he had already talked publicly about laïcité and considered The Times’s coverage biased.
The incidents in Albertville and elsewhere underscored the breadth of the government’s strong security response to the attacks, which has extended into the classroom and has drawn the criticism of organizations like the Human Rights League, one of the nation’s oldest rights groups. Calling the response disproportionate, the group asked, “Do children still have the right to speak?”
Sophie Legrand, a juvenile court judge and union official, said that France was going through a “complex period” during which law enforcement would be severely blamed for “missing a sign and failing to carry out an investigation.”
“But it could prove to be counterproductive if it’s really only repression, right away,” she said.
Still reeling from the beheading, teachers were given strict instructions to report the slightest inappropriate comment, and the police to investigate, according to interviews with teachers, union representatives, and police and judicial officials.
“We’re completely in a context where the instructions are to not overlook anything, even the most trivial fact,” said Emmanuel De Souza, a police commander who investigated the case of an 11-year-old in Saumur, in western France.
While the four children in Albertville are now back in school, the experience has left them traumatized, the parents said. The children are expected to follow an educational program under the justice ministry’s youth protection division, likely to focus on issues of citizenship.
One of the boys, Sohib Harid, wetted himself in his sleep after the raid and said he was now afraid to talk in school. “If I talk,” he said, “there will be the police.”
The children and teenagers got into trouble for speaking during classroom commemorations and discussions of Samuel Paty, the middle school teacher who was beheaded last month in a crime that shocked France and reopened the psychological wounds of attacks by Islamist terrorists that have left more than 250 dead in recent years.
In a nation with millions of public school students, the commemorations and discussions went well over all. But afterward, according to the education ministry, 400 incidents were reported, including 150 cases related to “defending terrorism.”
A justice ministry spokeswoman said that 14 minors had been held in custody or interrogated in police stations, though she added that the figure might not include reports from all local prosecutors. Cases involving the investigation of at least 17 minors have been reported in the French news media.
If convicted on charges of “defending terrorism,” minors would typically have to take a class on citizenship or follow a social program, though the sentences could be harsher for older teenagers and depending on the infraction.
In a Paris suburb, a 17-year-old who repeatedly expressed support for the slain teacher’s killer is expected to appear before an investigating judge. Near Marseille, two 16-year-old boys were arrested — one for endorsing the beheading, the other for refusing to stop listening to music with headphones during the minute of silence.
Of 17 cases that resulted in police investigations, seven involved Muslim students and one a Roman Catholic, according to interviews by The Times and the local news media; one had no religion, and the religion of the others could not be determined. In at least 14 of these cases, students were held in police custody, with most being accused of “defending terrorism.”
In France, public schools have played a central role in instilling national values, including laïcité, the strict secularism that separates religion from the state. So when Mr. Paty was decapitated, the killing was regarded as an attack on France and left a lasting trauma among teachers.
The education minister, Mr. Blanquer, asked all public schools to observe a minute of silence in tribute to the slain teacher on Nov. 2. A fierce advocate of laïcité, the minister warned that he would not tolerate disrespect.
“We are going to strengthen moral and civic education so that the stakes of the freedom of expression are explicit,” he said in a radio interview a few days later.
Beyond the minute of silence, teachers were given little guidance on how to discuss the killing in class, leading to confusion, according to several teachers and union officials.
“Everything was done in a rush without any real time for educational preparation,” said Sophie Vénétitay, a teacher and union official. She added that teachers were given little opportunity to resolve the incidents within the schools and with the parents, and that a judicial response prevailed.
In a middle school near Nice, a 14-year-old girl was arrested, held in custody for eight hours and subjected to a full-body search after questioning the tribute to the teacher and then, during a following debate, saying that “he had asked for it.” The girl, who is not affiliated with any religion, apologized, said her mother, who asked to be identified only by her first name, Magali.
The mother said she disapproved of her daughter’s comments, but described them as “a teenager’s blunder.” Her daughter is now seeing a psychiatrist and refuses to go back to school.
The teenage girl has been summoned to appear before a prosecutor in January on a charge of “defending acts of terrorism,” according to court files obtained by The Times. She is expected to be sentenced to a multiday class on citizenship.
Lilia Parisot, an official at the Nice regional education authority who confirmed the incident, said that she had received clear guidelines from the education ministry to report any incident. “The orders were to overlook nothing,” she said.
In Albertville, the four 10-year-olds belong to families — three of Turkish and one of Algerian descent — who have lived in the city for years. Some have older siblings who attended the same small primary school, Louis Pasteur. 
In the classroom discussion, the teacher asked the pupils whether he, too, could be beheaded if he showed caricatures of Muhammad, according to interviews with two of the children, four mothers and two fathers.
Nathalie Reveyaz, an education official focusing on secularism in the region that includes Albertville, confirmed that the teacher had asked that question, placing it in the context of caricatures during the reign of Charlemagne.
The boys answered that the teacher could be beheaded, their parents said, but meant it as a statement of fact, not as a threat.
“The teacher said, ‘If I draw the prophet, what would you do?’” recalled Sohib, the boy now afraid to talk in class. “Well, I said, ‘There are other people who will come to kill you, like Samuel Paty.’”
Another boy, Yunus-Emre Akdag, said that in “Islam, we don’t have the right to kill. It’s God who can give life, and it’s God who can take it,” according to his mother, Mukaddes Akdag. Her son added in class, “If people show caricatures of our prophet, they will burn in the other world.”
The girl, Emira Yildirim, said she had expressed regret for the slain teacher, but added that “if he had not shown the caricatures, it wouldn’t have happened.”
The parents said that their children’s remarks contained no threat, but simply did not fit with what education officials wanted to hear in the current politicized climate.
“The children said what they thought,” said Emira’s mother, Zulbiye Yildirim.
Ms. Reveyaz, the education official, said, “The teacher was shocked, shaken,” adding that the comments could reflect “what the children were hearing within their families.”
The next day, the teacher became alarmed after finding an anonymous letter whose author remains unknown, she said. “T mort,” it read, “You’re dead.” The local prosecutor, Pierre-Yves Michau, was unavailable for an interview, his office said.
After the raid, while the children were in custody, the police asked the parents a series of questions: What did they think of the caricatures? Did they pray? Did they go to the mosque? Did they observe Ramadan? Did their husbands force them to wear veils?
“Strange questions,” Fatima Harid, Sohib’s mother, said, asking why questions about their religious practices were relevant. An officer told her that her son, who described himself as Muslim during questioning, should say “French Muslim” instead, she said.
But the incident has left the parents wondering whether they will ever be considered French.
The mother of Emira, Ms. Yildirim, 46, said she had lived in France since age 6 and had attended its public schools. Hers was an “integrated family,” she said. Residents of Albertville for 19 years, she and her husband, a builder, run a family construction business. She was active at the school, regularly volunteering on field trips. The couple even sent their oldest daughter and son, now in their 20s, to a private high school — a Catholic institution — for the quality of the education.
“I’m worried,” she said, dropping off Emira in front of the primary school the other morning. “I told my daughter, ‘You don’t say anything. When you’re asked a question in class, you say nothing.’”

55,/content/Bias_Incident_Lexis_1.DOCX,Arutz Sheva,2020-12-10,956 words,,Moshe Phillips,,Why Black conservatives in academia have supported Israel for decades,False,"Contrasting Dr. Walter E. Williams with Israel-hater Dr. Lamont Hill is a stark reminder of what so much of academia has become. Opinion..
The death of Dr. Walter E. Williams (1936-2020) at age 84 in early December presents an opportunity to examine why so many Black conservatives in academia and media have supported Israel for decades compared to Israel-haters like Marc Lamont Hill. 
Williams was Professor of Economics at George Mason University, as well as a syndicated columnist. 
From 1973 to 1980 Williams was an economics professor at Temple University. He promoted free market ideas and in its December 2 obituary, the Wall Street Journal noted that ""America has lost &#111ne of its greatest economists and public intellectuals."" 
By contrast Lamont Hill, age 41, says he is ""Present Assistant Professor of Urban Education & American Studies (at) Temple University (Affiliated Professor of Anthropology) (Affiliated Professor of American Studies)"" &#111n the CV &#111n his website. 
That is a stark reminder of what Temple and so much of academia has become. A change from Economics taught to understand the destructive nature of socialism has become to. ""Urban Education & American Studies"" taught to denigrate America at every turn. 
But, there is more. Much more. 
You see, while Williams supported Israel and wanted to see a strong U.S.-Israel relationship, Lamont Hill demanded at the UN two years ago ""a free Palestine from the river to the sea."" Clearly calling for the elimination of Israel. 
Lamont Hill has long defended his relationship with Farrakhan and has been a very vocal advocate of the conspiracy theory that convicted cop killer Mumia Abu-Jamal is wrongly imprisoned. 
Conversely, some snapshots of Dr. Williams's opinions &#111n Israel from his columns are well worth sharing: 
From 2014: 
""Anti-Semitic attacks have skyrocketed in Europe in the wake of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It's not just a criticism of Israel's foreign policy it's an attack &#111n Jews."" 
""Israel is the &#111nly democratic nation in the Middle East. It has respect for relatively free markets, personal liberty and private property rights."" 
""It has to be heart-rending to any decent person to witness the suffering of the Palestinians, who're experiencing a major tragedy both in casualties and in property destruction. Though it is Hamas firing rockets into Israel, the ordinary Palestinian is not to be held blameless. Palestinians know that Hamas is storing rockets and building tunnels in civilian areas and that if Israel tries to take out these rockets and tunnels, civilian casualties will be part of the collateral damage. Their silence and acceptance implies support for the tactics of Hamas. Gen. William T. Sherman told the 1879 graduating class of the Michigan Military Academy, ""War is hell."" There's no nice war, and that's why war should be a last alternative. Those Westerners who criticize Israel's response to close to 3,000 rocket attacks might tell us what Israel should do in response &mdash just take the rockets, surrender or leave the Middle East?"" 
From 2019: 
""The Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum also includes gross anti-Israel bias and teaches about a Palestinian-led anti-Israel initiative called Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions. The curriculum also has students study issues of police brutality and asks teachers to find incidents of bias by police in their own communities. According to an article by Shelby Talcott in The Stream, California""s proposed curriculum called for students to study lawmakers such as Democratic Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar and Democratic Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, both of whom have supported the BDS movement and have been accused of anti-Semitic rhetoric."" 
Rashida Tlaib (who just days before used the murderous slogan ""From the River to the Sea"" &#111n Twitter) and Lamont Hill will appear &#111n a December 15, 2020 panel organized by several BDS and anti-Israel groups called, ""Dismantling Antisemitism, Winning Justice."" 
Dr. Williams and Lamont Hill both graduated from Philadelphia public schools. Both taught at Temple. Both commented &#111n Israel. And that""s where their similarities end. 
CAMERA has said that organizers ""seek the demise of the Jewish state, in order to redefine antisemitism."" Also, Bari Weiss, former New York Times columnist, tweeted that the event seemed to actually be focused &#111n ""dismantling accusations of antisemitism."" 
Dr. Williams and Lamont Hill both graduated from Philadelphia public schools. Both taught at Temple. Both commented &#111n Israel. And that""s where their similarities end. 
One embraced the truth about Israel and &#111ne embraces hate and endorses terrorism. 
It is long past the time for Temple to correct its sin and dismiss Lamont Hill as CNN did in 2018 after his UN hate speech. He has no business being in front of a classroom indoctrinating students with his vile hatred. It's just a shame he never sat in Dr. Williams""s classroom. He would be better for it as would the rest of us who did not have the honor and privilege. 
And the reason is not just as Dr. Thomas Sowell wrote in his amazing memorial tribute to his ""best friend for half a century"" -- ""Walter Williams loved teaching. Unlike too many other teachers today, he made it a point never to impose his opinions &#111n his students. (...) We may not see his like again. And that is our loss.""

CT lawmakers can’t correct justice issues in a short session
The Connecticut Post
July 9
Exactly when did all that chatter in Hartford about tolls fade so far back in the rear-view mirror?
Remember those heady summer days of 2019 when Gov. Ned Lamont kept alluding to a special session dedicated to a deep dive into the tolls issue? That never happened, and the issue that hogged the road in the first half of the year stalled out by Christmas.
Here we are, back in July anticipating a special session, and there’s a lot more traffic for legislators to negotiate.
Lamont sounds adamant about limiting the goals of the session for the week of July 20 to one or two.
“I’m pretty cautious what you can do on a two- or three-day special session,” he said. “I like what we’re focused on right now, which is voting and voting rights and absentee (ballots) as well as police accountability.”
The absentee ballot issue is probably the only sure thing, but even that faces considerable opposition. To us, it sounds like a no-brainer — even without a pandemic — to expand the use of absentee ballots on Election Day beyond those who are ill. The number of eligible voters who traditionally participate in this most cherished of rights is painfully low, and every effort should be made to ease the process.
One remedy is to revise state law to also open absentee ballots to anyone who fears being exposed to illness, a certainty this November when they would enter indoor polling places surrounded by strangers in masks.
But there is stark division on the issue, as the minority Republicans are following the party script that absentee ballots invite voter fraud.
While the voter issue is motivated by this once-in-a-lifetime pandemic, the Black Lives Matter movement is driving the call for enhancing police transparency.
Members of the Black and Puerto Rican Caucus are understandably trying to seize the moment to drive deeper change. At a news conference Tuesday, they unveiled an outline of interests they hope could lead to systemic reforms, reaching beyond voting rights and police accountability to education and housing equity and economic and environmental justice.
Generations of racial injustices can’t be course-corrected in a special session that will last no longer than a holiday weekend. We’d like lawmakers to agree on an absentee ballot solution and stand united on assuring police accountability.
Lawmakers are floating the idea of a September session to catch up on more mundane matters, and there will likely be issues related to the pandemic that cry for immediate action. By that time, legislators trying to enhance their Election Day profiles will surely float distracting pet causes as well.
Lamont hinted that bigger issues requiring a public hearing should wait until such gatherings can be held beneath the gold dome, which at best means 2021.
Transformative reform calls for bold action, but will take months and years of refinement. These are issues that must not fade in the rear-view mirror.

An irrational assault on higher education
The Boston Globe
July 8
“When foreigners attend our great colleges & want to stay in the U.S., they should not be thrown out of our country.”
Those are the words of the president of the United States, Donald Trump. He tweeted them nearly five years ago. Trump, at that point, seemingly agreed with the most basic notion that foreign students enrich America.
Yet the Trump administration went out of its way to disrupt life for international students Monday, when US Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced new guidance for student visa holders. International students enrolled in the upcoming fall semester in colleges and universities that move classes completely online because of the coronavirus outbreak won’t be allowed in, or will have to leave the country or transfer to a different university if they are already in the country. Even if the school has a hybrid model, offering some classes online and some in-person, a foreign student won’t be allowed by this policy to enroll in just online classes while staying in the United States.
Such a policy was in place before the pandemic, and then it might have made some amount of sense — a student wouldn’t need a visa to be physically present in the United States if all classes are taught online anyway. But the new guidance is a departure from the more recent federal waiver policy set up to deal with the pandemic: As colleges shifted to online classes, their foreign students were allowed to stay in the United States. Considering the still-raging pandemic, it would make sense to keep those waivers in place.
But now, under the new rule, many foreigners are simply going to drop out, rather than face the prospect of taking virtual classes from their home countries. There are about a million international students in the United States, with half of them coming just from two countries: China and India. Massachusetts ranks in the top five states with the most foreign students with 77,000.
“Time zones are going to be a huge problem,” said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy counsel at the American Immigration Council. “Indian and Chinese students will have to attend classes from 9 p.m. to 3 a.m. And there are countries where access to the right technology is going to be an issue, as well.”
The thinly veiled reason for the policy is to pressure universities to reopen for in-person instruction, using their foreign students (most of whom pay the full tuition price) as hostages. The administration has pretty much admitted that — on the record. “This is now setting the rules for one semester, which we’ll finalize later this month, that will, again, encourage schools to reopen,” said Ken Cuccinelli, the acting deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, on CNN.
But rather than relenting to the pressure, the reaction from universities to Trump’s new policy has been swift. Barely two days passed before Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology filed suit in US District Court in Boston challenging Trump’s move. The schools allege that the “directive is arbitrary and capricious because it fails to offer any reasoned basis that could justify the policy.”
With the lawsuit, Harvard and MIT are seeking a temporary injunction on the policy. “ICE’s decision reflects a naked effort by the federal government to force universities to reopen all in-person classes notwithstanding their informed judgment that it is neither safe nor advisable to do so. The effect — perhaps even the goal — is to create chaos for schools and international students alike.”
Foreigners are yet again being used as pawns by the Trump administration. But a move like this one will have far-reaching consequences. In 2018, foreign students spent nearly $45 billion on tuition, living expenses, books, and other costs. Chinese students alone were responsible for $15 billion of that expenditure. At a time when the higher education market is struggling economically due to the pandemic, the potential loss of foreign students could be a huge financial blow.
More importantly, foreign students are a critical source of talent and job-creation. If the policy prevails, it would be a textbook example of the United States shooting itself in the foot. Here’s hoping that the pushback from higher education institutions leads the Trump Administration to come to its senses and leave this group of foreigners in place.

MAINE
A vote for Question 1 is a vote for the future of rural Maine
Kennebec Journal
July 5
The internet is integrated into everything we do. It’s no longer something you log onto here and there, but a constant feature — a portal through which nearly every part of our lives is organized and operated.
As such, it’s not a luxury — in fact, it’s hard to see it as anything but a necessity anymore. For doing business. For staying in touch with friends and family. For receiving health care and an education. For participating in democracy.
That’s why we support a “yes” vote on Question 1 on the July 14 statewide ballot, which sets aside $15 million to invest in high-speed internet in areas of the state where it is unavailable.
That’s also why the state should continue to help fund these projects beyond this bond until fast, affordable internet is available in each corner of the state, and to every resident.
THREAT TO SURVIVAL
The problem is indisputable. By one estimate, more than 83,000 Maine households have a low-speed internet connection or no connection at all. The households are located almost solely throughout the most rural parts of the state, where the loss of people and jobs over the last few decades has stunted economic growth.
Where there is no high-speed connection, businesses can’t send or receive large files easily, or connect with customers or vendors. Health care providers forced to cover large areas in rural Maine have trouble connecting with patients. Students can’t participate in remote learning, and don’t have immediate access to all the resources their peers do. Residents can’t work remotely, or stream the meetings of their local government, or even their favorite shows.
All of it combines to make rural Maine a more difficult place to live and work. It forces people born there to consider moving to areas with more opportunity, and it makes the areas less attractive to prospective businesses, residents and visitors.
In short, it is a threat to their survival.
Maine’s rural communities know it, too. But they’ve got little help from the private sector. Because there are too few potential customers, it doesn’t make financial sense for private internet providers to build the necessary infrastructure in these areas.
PLANS READY
In response, many communities have come up with plans of their own, typically using a combination of funding — local, state, federal, nonprofit and private — to give their residents access to high-speed internet.
The ConnectMaine Authority, the state entity charged with increasing broadband access, was created to provide funding and support to these communities. In the last 12 years, the group has awarded around $12 million in grants to 144 projects, extending internet access to nearly 40,000 households.
They’ve also issued planning grants totaling nearly half a million dollars to communities who want to figure out what they need when it comes to internet service, and the best way to get it.
According to ConnectMaine, more than 50 communities have already done this work and are ready to move forward with a project.
There are also communities throughout the state where providers are trying to fill in smaller gaps where fast internet is not available.
However, both kinds of projects need funding.
FUNDING NEEDED
The $15 million bond would leverage up to an estimated $30 million in other funds, which would help make those small and large projects a reality. Every dollar spent from this bond will make a difference in Maine communities.
But it’s just the one step in an ongoing effort. A much larger investment — spread out over years — is needed to make sure all of Maine has high-speed internet.
ConnectMaine says it will take an investment of at least $600 million total to extend a high-speed fiber network to all unserved roads. In its action plan released in January, the group recommends a state investment of $40 million a year for the next five years.
That may sound like a lot. But Maine voters have approved a bond for highway improvements for more than twice that amount in each of the last five years, and will likely approve another $105 million for that purpose on July 14.
Increasingly, living without the internet is like living without a phone or electricity — or without a road leading to your front door. Maybe you can get by, but you’ll miss out on a lot, and you’ll be way behind everyone else.
That’s not the future we should want for rural Maine.

VERMONT
Strange or dangerous?
Times Argus
July 6
It’s hard to know whether we are living in strange or dangerous times.
While there is a lot of heated debating about key issues facing Americans – race, social justice, police brutality and immigration, to name a few – we are seeing an uptick, even here in Vermont, in the number of incidents of vandalism done under the guise of free speech and political statements.
Last week, there was an incident in which Vermont State Police stated they had identified white supremacist graffiti found at Waterbury Reservoir.
A worker found the graffiti painted on the east side of the dam — a location that has little visibility to the public and is not viewable from the water.
According to troopers: “The graffiti was identified as coming from the hate group Patriot Front and was applied using a stencil, allowing ... the offender to apply the images quickly then leave. There is no video of the site on the dam where the graffiti was applied, and there are no known witnesses or suspects.”
Previously, after a Black Lives Matter mural was painted along a length of State Street in Montpelier, an individual – in full view of surveillance cameras – defaced the mural to state, “Black Lies Matter,” and then proceeded to deface the granite sidewalk leading to the State House. Within that same week, individuals in vehicles as large as loaded tractor trailer trucks squealed tires or braked hard enough to leave large tire marks across the giant mural.
Yesterday, state police announced they were investigating “potential bias-related incidents in Jericho and Underhill in which unknown subjects damaged Black Lives Matter artwork painted on three roads in the communities.”
All three incidents were discovered by a trooper on patrol Monday morning, and involved evidence that vehicles had burned out tires over the artwork. Two of the locations, on Browns Trace and Pleasant Valley roads, had “Black Lives Matter” painted in the roadway. At the third location, on Irish Settlement Road, “Black Trans Lives Matter” was displayed. At the Browns Trace Road location, white and brown paint had been poured on the artwork.
Reports of all of these cases have been sent to the Attorney General’s Office under the Bias Incident Reporting System.
But bold statements are being made elsewhere, as well.
Less than an hour after it was finished this past Saturday afternoon, vandals came for a Black Lives Matter street slogan in Martinez, California.
In broad daylight, with witnesses recording on phones, a woman in flip-flops and a patriotic shirt splattered a can of black paint over the bright yellow “L” in “Black” heaving her paint roller over the letters outside the Contra Costa County courthouse in California. Her companion, a man in a red “Four More Years” shirt from President Trump’s campaign and red “Make America Great Again” hat, told onlookers, “No one wants Black Lives Matter here.”
“What is wrong with you?” someone asked the unidentified vandals from off-camera, in a viral video of the incident also shared by police. “We’re sick of this narrative, that’s what’s wrong,” the man responded. “The narrative of police brutality, the narrative of oppression, the narrative of racism. It’s a lie.” The woman scrubbed away with her black paint roller, looking up to say, “Keep this s- — in f--- — New York. This is not happening in my town.”
The Martinez Police Department is searching for the suspects in this high-profile incident of vandalism targeting. Incidents also have been reported in Cleveland and several other communities nationwide.
Across the nation, consensus is growing about the existence of systemic racism in American policing and other facets of American life, and longtime organizers of the Black Lives Matter movement are trying to extend its momentum beyond the popularization of a phrase.
Activists are sensing a once-in-a-generation opportunity to demand policy changes that once seemed far-fetched, including sharp cuts to police budgets in favor of social programs, and greater accountability for officers who kill residents.
But activists’ demands to “defund” police departments already have become a point of division politically, with some prominent people who have expressed support for the movement saying they do not support what they see as an extreme policy position.
Looking at the massive social media response to the graffiti at Waterbury Reservoir, which accused both the police and this newspaper’s staff of propagating lies and attempting to incite fear and divisiveness among citizens, we are leaning more toward “dangerous” over “strange.”

F. Kennedy Elementary School in Winooski is translated into Nepali, Somali, Arabic, Vietnamese and Burmese. Photo by Bob LoCicero/VT Digger Current and former students in Winooski, Vermont's only majority-minority school district, are demanding[1] their schools enact sweeping racial justice reforms including changing the district's hiring and curriculum to better reflect the school's demographics. The group, who call themselves Winooski Students for Anti-Racism, are also asking the district to create a Racial Truth and Reconciliation Commission to collect testimonials from students and families about instances of bias and racism in the district. And they want a permanent anti-racism committee where students can report incidents of bias and discrimination. 
Student organizers presented a list of eight demands[2] to the school board on Wednesday evening during a meeting held over Zoom, and told board members that white district leaders had repeatedly failed to meet the racially diverse student body's needs and ignored the covert -and overt - racism students had endured. Indra Acharya, a 2014 graduate of the district, said he had been racially profiled by administrators and subjected to daily bag and body checks in the principal's office while in high school. 'For 30 days, you all searched my body,' he said. Abdikhafar Yussuf, another alumni, said he had no one to turn to - save Acharya - when, at an away game in 2013, a player on the opposing soccer team had called him and his teammates 'monkeys doing tricks.' In the chat running alongside the video call, Acharya chimed in: 'Brother, we talked about these in our track field runs. That's what we had to endure.' So, too, did Hiba Laaroussi, a student representative on Winooski's school board who plays soccer. ' We were called brownies,' she wrote. Yussuf said he didn't begrudge white educators and administrators for being ill-equipped to understand his experiences. But he said it was still incumbent on them to do better. 'Because of your skin color you will never have to go through this trauma. And I don't blame you - you're born with this. But I will blame you if you don't take action right now,' he said.Winooski is a refugee resettlement site, and about 55% of the district's students are non-white. A little under 900 students attend Winooski schools, and a significant portion of the student body originally hail from Somalia, Nepal, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The nationwide Black Lives Matter movement has once again put the spotlight on police, and the officers who are regularly posted inside the country's hallways are also coming under scrutiny[3]. The group in Winooski also wants administrators to get rid of the district's school resource officers and replace them with trauma specialists. The students also want a fully-funded ethnic studies program in place by the beginning of 2022-23 school year, and demand that the district commit to a teaching staff where at least 15% of educators are people of color within three years. Andy Siki, who graduated this spring from the high school, echoed several peers when he told the school board a nearly all-white teaching staff meant students had few role models to identify with. 'We can't look forward to becoming successful if we have an old white guy teaching us or if we have someone that doesn't look like us so we can picture ourselves,' he said. A growing body of evidence indicates that teachers of color can significantly boost outcomes for non-white students. One recent Johns Hopkins study[4] found that the chances of low-income Black boys dropping out of high school fell by 39% if they were assigned at least one Black teacher between grades 3 and 5. Another showed[5] that non-Black teachers have significantly lower expectations of Black students than do Black teachers. 'It cannot be overstated how important it is. And I see that every day,' Mugabo Thierry Uwilingiyimana, the lone teacher of color at Winooski's middle and high school, said in an interview before the school board meeting. The former Rwandan refugee, who grew up in upstate New York, said the all-white spaces in which he had gone to school - and later work - had often required him to erase those parts of himself that didn't conform to the dominant culture. When his students are policed in the same way now, they know he can relate. 'Students look to me sort of with the expectation that surely I understand,' he said. 'This one Congolese girl saying 'Why don't they want us to be African? You know that we're loud.''The group also wants the district to hire a consultant or expert to host biannual workshops educating parents and students about their rights under special education and civil rights laws. And they are asking the schools to establish a mentorship program for English-language learners that would match students with community mentors. The board ultimately voted unanimously to recognize the demands, and promised to address them one-by-one at a meeting scheduled for next Wednesday. One school board member, Alex Yin, even offered that the board issue a formal apology to students, and particularly Acharya. Mike Decarreau, the board's chair, said he had lived in Winooski his entire life and was 'struck' by the student's testimony. 'This was probably one of the most powerful evenings to understand the viewpoint from the students who have just come out of our system -or are still in,' he said. But Margaret Bass, another school board member, urged her peers to make firm commitments as quickly as possible. 'The testimony tonight has spoken to years and years of longstanding abuse and racism,' she said. 'The fact that nothing, nothing has happened in all this time is stunning to me. So I would not trust to do anything more than to give lip service. I would not trust us. They have no reason to trust us.'Read the story on VTDigger here: Winooski students demand sweeping anti-racist reforms[6].

58,/content/Bias_Incident_Lexis_1.DOCX,EFE Newswire - Americas in Focus,2020-08-18,823 words,,at/ssa/pd/tw,,Michelle Obama slams Trump on opening night of Democratic convention; US ELECTIONS,False,"By Albert Traver
Washington DC, Aug 18 (EFE).- Former United States first lady Michelle Obama made a powerful call for the defeat of President Donald Trump in her keynote speech on Monday on the opening night of the 2020 Democratic National Convention, which is being held in a virtual format on account of the coronavirus pandemic.
""Let me be as honest and clear as I possibly can. Donald Trump is the wrong president for our country. He has had more than enough time to prove that he can do the job but he is clearly in over his head. He cannot meet this moment. He simply cannot be who we need him to be for us. It is what it is,"" Obama said.
She also spoke about the divisions in the country in her pre-recorded speech.
""Now, I understand that my message won't be heard by some people. We live in a nation that is deeply divided, and I am a Black woman speaking at the Democratic convention,"" she said.
""But enough of you know me by now. You know that I tell you exactly what I'm feeling. You know I hate politics. But you also know that I care about this nation. You know how much I care about all of our children.""
She also warned those watching the convention that if there was one message they should walk away with, it was that the situation could get worse.
""So if you take one thing from my words tonight, it is this: if you think things cannot possibly get worse, trust me, they can, and they will if we don't make a change in this election,"" added Obama, who urged people to ""vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it.""
Obama's speech was the star address of the first day of the convention, which lasted for barely two hours, much shorter than previous editions.
Very few of the other participants, who also mostly made pre-recorded speeches, stood out nor caught the attention of the media or social media like the former first lady.
The exception was perhaps Senator Bernie Sanders, who ended his campaign and threw his support behind Joe Biden in the face of the ""path of authoritarianism"" that, in his view, the Trump administration has taken.
""Let me take this opportunity to say a word to the millions who supported my campaign this year and in 2016,"" said Sanders.
""Many of the ideas we fought for, that just a few years ago were considered 'radical,' are now mainstream. But, let us be clear, if Donald Trump is re-elected, all the progress we have made will be in jeopardy,"" added the senator, who received 10 million votes in the primaries in which he faced Biden.
Sanders emphasized that the upcoming Nov. 3 elections will be ""the most important in the modern history of this country,"" saying that, under Trump's administration, ""authoritarianism has taken root in our country.""
Sanders, who leads the party's left wing, called on progressives, moderates and conservatives to work together to fight a president who, he added, ""is not only incapable of addressing these crises but is leading us down the path of authoritarianism.""
""Nero fiddled while Rome burned. Trump golfs,"" he said.
The Democrats had also invited victims of the two crises that have rocked the country in recent months and which Trump has been accused of failing to manage: the COVID-19 epidemic and police violence.
Philonise Floyd, brother of George Floyd, whose death in May in the custody of a white police officer in Minneapolis sparked a wave of racial justice protests across the country, took part in the convention.
""George should be alive today. Breonna Taylor should be alive today. Ahmaud Arbery should be alive today. Eric Garner should be alive today. Stephon Clark, Atatiana Jefferson, Sandra Bland - they should all be alive today,"" he said, listing those also killed in alleged racially biased incidents and for whom he led a moment of silence.
The other speaker was Kristin Urquiza, who lost her father in June to COVID-19, which has already claimed 170,000 lives in the US, more than in any other country.
""I'm one of the many who have lost a loved one to COVID. My dad, Mark Anthony Urquiza, should be here today, but he isn't,"" she said.
""My dad was a healthy 65-year-old. His only pre-existing condition was trusting Donald Trump - and for that he paid with his life.""
Trump was very active on Twitter during the first day of the Democratic convention although he completely ignored Biden and directed his anger against New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who slammed the White House for its handling of the pandemic.
The US president fired off a dozen tweets and retweets against Cuomo, blaming him for the more than 32,000 coronavirus deaths in his state.
In a statement on Monday night, the Trump 2020 campaign's national press secretary Hogan Gidley said ""if Joe Biden had been president, the coronavirus crisis would be dramatically worse.""
""Democrats can try to conceal the dangerous truth with a Hollywood-produced infomercial, but they can't hide the fact that the radical socialist leftist takeover of Joe Biden is complete,"" he added. EFE",Bias Incident

MERIP recently decided to re-publish Aïdi's piece on the Save Darfur movement. In this post, Aïdi compares the current Black Lives Matter protests to the Darfur mobilisation.
In hindsight, June 16 2015 was a turning point, a date critical to understanding today's political tumult. That was the day Donald Trump announced his candidacy for president, theatrically descending the escalator at Trump Tower, then giving a rambling speech that linked illegal immigration, terrorism, and the offshoring of American jobs. 
It was the moment when he introduced the phrase ""Make America Great Again"" and vowed to build a ""great, great wall on our southern border."" The media would focus on his derogatory remarks about Mexicans ""bringing drugs, bringing crime."" Trump's candidacy would cause an immediate spike in hate crimes and send political groups scrambling to join forces with-or distance themselves from-whichever group he targeted next. His following surged as he rode the wave of white nationalist backlash to immigration, failed wars and a black incumbent.
Among the more intriguing developments in the wake of Trump's candidacy was the rise in anti-Muslim speech from Hispanic celebrities and public figures. Conservative Hispanic politicians had long argued that immigration reform was stalling because of Muslim terrorists slipping through the southern border. For example, New Mexico Governor Susan Martinez had called for more security at the US-Mexico border in 2013, after Border Patrol agents found candy wrappers with Arabic writing. 
But Trump's brutal joining of the question of Hispanic migration with terrorism, of Islamophobia, and Hispanophobia (long linked in French and English colonial thought, but not in the American imaginary) would unleash a torrent of anti-Muslim speech on Spanish talk radio and social media. Miss Puerto Rico Destiny Vélez tweeted that Muslims ""terrorise innocent Americans,"" adding that, ""Mexicans, Arabs, Jews and anything in between aren't the same thing."" 
In August 2015, Ramon Escobar, a youngish Hispanic American diplomat who had handled State Department engagement with the Muslim world, ranted to a handful of journalists about his tour in Saudi Arabia, saying that in the Gulf's failed societies ""it's always the will of Allah"" and expressed outrage that Latinos were being associated with terrorism. 
As the campaign unfolded, more prominent Hispanic politicians sounded off: Texas Senator Ted Cruz called for law enforcement to patrol Muslim neighborhoods while Florida Senator Marco Rubio denigrated President Barack Obama for visiting a mosque in Baltimore. This rhetoric was aimed at distancing Latinos from Muslims, to signal that Latinos were not a national security issue.
Trump's candidacy and rise to office ultimately proved as politically cataclysmic as the events of September 11, 2001, generating unexpected animosities, alliances, and bizarre new discourses. Thirty percent of Latinos ended up voting for Trump, while Hindu nationalists rallied behind his stances on terrorism and immigration. But Trump's ascent also precipitated much solidarity on the left, as groups mobilised against the Muslim ban and to defend DACA. 
Resistance to Trump also coalesced to produce wins for progressive candidates nationwide, including four women of color (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib) elected to Congress in 2018 who became known as The Squad. These victories occurred alongside a surge of hate crimes against Jews, Muslims, and Hispanics, with a terrible mass shooting of Hispanics at a Walmart in Texas in November 2019. As groups integrate into the American political process, they often reflect the country's deep rifts, frequently manifesting in a split between those wanting to express solidarity or opposition to the Muslim other. 
Unsurprisingly, the Trump years have been characterised by a rise in Hispanic Islamophobia, including the tragic high-profile murders of Muslims by young Hispanics, most prominently of Nadra Hassanen in Washington, DC and Imam Maulana Akonjee and Thara Uddin at a mosque in Ozone Park, Queens.
In early 2005, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the David C. Driskell Center for the Study of the African Diaspora at the University of Maryland, trying to understand a social movement that was spreading rapidly across US campuses and cities, and eventually to France and Britain. The Save Darfur movement took off in early 2004-in circumstances not unlike the present moment-as a buffoonish, flailing Republican president ran for a second term against a lackluster Democratic candidate in a war on terror context. 
I subsequently published an essay in Middle East Report titled ""Slavery, Genocide and the Politics of Outrage: Understanding the New Racial Olympics"" that sought to explain why of all the civil wars in Africa and humanitarian crises in the world, it was the mass violence in western Sudan that had gripped the American imagination. The answer, I argued, lay in the post-September 11 domestic political scene:
The Save Darfur movement started on college campuses to counter pro-Palestinian agitation. When Students for Justice in Palestine would bring Israeli refuseniks to speak, the American Anti-Slavery Group founded by Charles Jacobs-who would also launch Save Darfur-would respond by bringing Sudanese ""lost boys"" to speak about Arab racism. Jacobs was also the founder of The David Project, which monitored Middle East Studies departments for alleged anti-Israel prejudice and funded the film Columbia UnBecoming, which claims to document incidents of bias in that university's Department of Middle East and Asian Languages and Cultures.
To show how these three American nationalisms - evangelical, Jewish and black - overlapped in Sudan, I highlighted three frontiers: the colonial and Huntingtonian so-called faultline between Africa and the Arab world that ran through Sudan; the urban periphery where competing conceptions of the Middle East co-existed uneasily and where Latino immigration was leading to fears of ethnic succession; and finally the US-Mexico border where Hispanic migration had led to Minuteman vigilantism and to Samuel Huntington's warning of a ""demographic Reconquista"" and a backlash from whites fearing ""replacement.""
The current protest movement against police brutality-unfolding during a horrific pandemic crisis that has exposed and deepened societal fissures-clearly differs from the Save Darfur movement. For starters, the current protest is against American state violence, specifically the recurring spectacle of police cruelty against black men. Black Lives Matter is not calling for military intervention, and in fact has an anti-colonial facet. Save Darfur activists, on the other hand, would often chant ""Out of Iraq, Into Sudan.""
Since the Covid-19 crisis began in February, the global war on terror seems to have faded away; the war on the new ""invisible enemy""-and the Trump administration's hapless response-have dominated headlines. The absence of a Muslim bogeyman seems to have created space for new alliances and coalitions, as the establishment foreign policy hawks have receded from view. Another difference is that while, in 2005, some older Afrocentrists (like the late comedian Dick Gregory) supported Save Darfur, the majority of black (and minority) leaders steered clear of the movement. 
Save Darfur ended up being a largely white movement led by a Jewish-Christian coalition. Jewish organisations, which agitated on campuses in the mid-2000s, have been relatively silent in recent years, perhaps because their policy objectives have been achieved. The Department of Education has moved to sanction and deny Title VI funding to a number of Middle East Studies programs deemed biased, the US embassy has been relocated to Jerusalem and Israel is moving to annex additional Palestinian territories.
The current movement, under the aegis of Black Lives Matter, is multi-ethnic and multi-racial, and while it has inspired protests globally, it is focused domestically on police violence and reparations. If Trumpism was a response to the humiliation of failed wars in Afghanistan and Iraq (it is no coincidence that the Minuteman Project began patrolling the southern border days after the Abu Ghraib story broke) then Black Lives Matter is protesting the militarisation of urban policing resulting from those same unending wars. 
The decades of counterinsurgency abroad have boomeranged back home with the expansion of mass surveillance under Obama and the continuation of the Pentagon's 1033 program that has transferred $7.4-billion of surplus military equipment (such as armored vehicles and rifles) to law enforcement departments nationwide.
In February 2015, The Guardian broke a story about a ""black site"" operated by domestic law enforcement in Chicago, echoing the secret detention facilities used by US defense and intelligence agencies to interrogate and torture prisoners overseas. The militarisation of policing may have been newsworthy in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014 after the death of Michael Brown at the hands of the police, but it barely registered in 2012 when then-Mayor Pete Buttigieg shared a New York Times article titled ""With Green Beret Tactics, Combating Gang Warfare"" with the comment: ""Interesting use of counter-insurgency tactics to address gang violence."" Nor was much made of Minnesota Governor Tom Waltz's recent claim that the unrest made American cities look like Baghdad or Mogadishu.
Now, 15 years after Save Darfur, American power and prestige are vastly diminished. In 2005, the neo-cons calling for intervention in Sudan were in part vexed by China's access to Sudan's oil, as well as Beijing's refusal to isolate the regime of former Sudanese President Omar Al-Bashir. (Stephen Spielberg famously withdrew as adviser to the Beijing Olympics because of China's Darfur policy.) Today as Chinese-American relations are in free-fall, China has surpassed the United States as Africa's biggest trade partner and Trump allegedly appealed to Chinese President Xi Jinping for help in the upcoming election.
But the parallels and continuities between Save Darfur and the current movement are striking-the three frontiers are still politically relevant. At his inaugural speech, Trump warned that ""places like Afghanistan are safer than our inner cities."" The president is still intrigued by comparisons of Islam's ""bloody borders"" with the southern US border and continues to link the two, as when he threatened to designate Mexican drug cartels terrorist organisations, or when he placed Venezuela on the updated Muslim ban list because the Maduro government was allegedly granting Venezuelan passports to Hezbollah militants.
Prima facie, the president's fascination with the inner city may appear less comprehensible than his obsession with the southern border; but these two frontiers are critical to understanding his persona. Trump's America First worldview, we are told, is rooted in Jacksonian nationalism, which harks back to Andrew Jackson, the notorious slave-owning and slave-selling president and architect of the Indian Removal Act, whose portrait currently hangs in the Oval Office. 
In his well-regarded Special Providence: American Foreign Policy and How It Changed the World (2002), Walter Russell Mead describes the Jacksonian tradition as the honor-based, Scotch-Irish ethno-nationalism of the American frontier, a folk community hostile to elites, immigration, and international law, which believes the US should deploy ruthless military power whenever threatened. In an aside, Mead argues that despite their white supremacist roots, Jacksonian values had a major influence on African American culture in the South and also in the gang culture of inner cities which have re-created ""the atmosphere and practices of American frontier life.""
Few would think of Trump as a blend of hip hop and Jacksonian swag, but a case could be made. Trump was an icon in hip hop culture for decades, a symbol of ostentatious wealth, his name mentioned in some 300 rap lyrics. As Charles Blow of The New York Times wrote, the Queens-born real estate magnate rose alongside the genre in 1970s New York watching ""the moguls it made, the bravado it brandished. He liked it, envied it, aped it."" And for all his disdain for poor minorities, soon learned ""how to assert white privilege and emulate black power."" 
In fact, Trump weaponised New York city's hip hop culture, appropriating - in Blow's words - the ""coarser side"" of black culture to build a blustering populist brand that propelled him to the country's highest political office. It is ironic that as gangsta rap declined in the mid-2000s (making way for a gentler, more up-lifting Kendrick-Drake sound), its echoes can still be seen in the Oval Office and among populist strongmen elsewhere. Consider Brazilian leader Jair Bolsonaro, who has a coterie of MAGA-hat-wearing rappers who compose lyrics in support of his reactionary platform. Still, it is worth emphasising that in the US (and Brazil) the hip hop community turned overwhelmingly against Trump once he was in the White House.
As during the Darfur crisis, the Muslim grocer in the inner city is still a source of contention. In November 2005, liquor stores in Oakland owned by Muslim immigrants were vandalised (one store burnt down, and an employee kidnapped.) In 2015, following the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson outside a store owned by an Indian immigrant, a boycott was organised of immigrant-owned stores. Anger at the figure of the Muslim grocer has surfaced again since the death of George Floyd, when it emerged that the call to the police was made by an employee of a Palestinian-owned grocery, prompting more calls for boycotts as well as attacks against Middle Eastern and South Asian-owned businesses in a range of cities. The debate continues among African Americans on the merits of solidarity with Arab/Muslim organisations. 
In 2005, Arab and Muslim activists were focused on lobbying the US Census Bureau to add a new MENA (Middle Eastern and North Africa) minority status category that would allow Americans from the region to claim non-white identity, and thus qualify for various civil rights protections (including special status as potential hate crime victims) as well as benefit from affirmative action policies. An energised black-Palestinian left emerged in 2014 speaking of a Gaza-Ferguson nexus, but a self-described school of Afropessimism continues to be wary of forming solidarities, especially with the Arab world where these critics say ""anti-blackness"" is ""foundational.""
Given that the Trump White House has flatly opposed the census request, these young anti-racism activists from Arab and Muslim backgrounds have turned their energy to countering police violence and surveillance as well as addressing the image of the anti-black Muslim shop-owner. 
Multiple initiatives have been launched by Middle Eastern and North African Americans - scholars and activists - most recently ""Arabs For Black Lives"" that attempt to mediate between Muslim grocers and their patrons by providing training in cultural difference, de-escalation, and support for these merchants to ""go green"" and carry produce in lieu of liquor and junk food. The generation that was in high school during the Darfur crisis has now come of age. 
But there remains a political gulf between this younger generation of woke Muslim activists, who are eager for acceptance into BLM and similar coalitions, and who are harshly critical of the much-maligned grocer - sometimes speaking of them as settlers and exploitative colonists-and the older generation (among them the shop-owners) who do not understand the difference between a Becky and a Karen, and do not see why they should be criticised for selling the alcohol and tobacco products their customers demand. 
Ironically, some of this local opposition leads Muslim grocers to relocate to Hispanic neighborhoods, where immigrant merchants selling such products have been less likely to draw criticism. Despite the Islamophobic rhetoric from political hopefuls, a recent poll shows that among whites, blacks and Hispanics, Hispanic Americans score the lowest on the Islamophobia Index, with Hispanic Americans five times more likely to hold favorable opinions of Muslims than negative ones (51% versus 10%).
In my 2005 essay, I concluded by observing that the topic of racism in North Africa and the Middle East has long been dominated by external interests and actors and marked by official suppression of all discussions of the region's legacies of slavery and racism. But even in the mid-2000s, one could see the emergence of an anti-racism discourse in the Middle East, enabled by the internet. That process has accelerated. The final sentence called for a celebration and mobilisation of Afro-Arab identity against tired Arab nationalist narratives and colonial separations.
Since the 2011 uprisings in the Middle East, and especially with the passage of Tunisia's anti-racism law in October 2018, social media abounds with Afro-Arab activists and new collectives. These black Arab voices run the gamut from socialist pan-Africanist feminists who quote Angela Davis to Afrocentrists who quote John Henry Clarke and his theory of Arabs overrunning Africa, a discourse last heard during the Save Darfur moment. The past is preface.
Geopolitically, much has changed-and not changed. The Sudanese strongman Omar Al-Bashir was toppled by a protest movement and is in prison awaiting an International Criminal Court trial for war crimes committed in Darfur. Yet Sudan is still in America's crosshairs. The mass violence in South Sudan has not resonated with the American public, but the new Sudanese regime is still under heavy pressure from Washington to recognise Israel in exchange for a lifting of sanctions-coercion that could derail Sudan's transition. Brand activism continues as well. 
Save Darfur drew celebrities and corporate actors, as companies began selling Darfur underwear, video games, and Timberland boots. Today retail companies are scrambling to capitalise on Black Lives Matter. Walmart has pledged to stop locking up so-called multicultural hair products in display cases and BAND-AID has released new bandages in different skin tones.
In conclusion, it is worth recalling that before America's grand ""awokening"" of 2020, there were protest movements in Sudan, Lebanon, Chile, Algeria, France, and Spain centered on exclusion and state violence. It is exhilarating to watch a protest movement against state brutality, white supremacy, colonial memory, and Trump-inspired racist contagion spread around the world. But it is not clear that an American-style anti-racism can counter racism in societies elsewhere, with their own race regimes and constructs. More importantly, it is worth noting that a backlash to the current protests is in the offing. 
This counter-movement could easily attempt to unify a polarised nation with time-honored tactics of division and distraction: by smashing current links of solidarity and directing the collective anger and bereavement caused by American policy failures toward a domestic or international other, be that Iran, Venezuela, Sudan, or mosques in America, as happened in 2005.

This study gathered 197 participants, interviewed within 48 hours of being victims of Hate Crime. This immediate follow-up should ensure accurate responses. The responses of the victims were compared to that of 113 Welsh front-line staff who respond to and support such victims. The barriers to reporting are found to be broadly similar with the findings of other UK studies. A considerable difference in understanding of the barriers to reporting hate crime was found between the victims and support services. The main reason given for non-reporting was common: the poor service, attitude and treatment from the police.
FULL TEXT
Introduction
This article will compare the findings of a study in Wales using Victim Support data with others from across the UK and will attempt to compare and contrast the findings, specifically looking at barriers to reporting identified by both victims of Hate Crime and frontline service providers across Wales. Service providers contributing to the research are from local authorities, the NHS, the police, housing associations, the probation service, the Crown Prosecution Service and third-sector organisations such as race equality councils, Citizens Advice and voluntary groups. This comparison will be contextualised within the regional and national policies adopted to prevent and support victims of hate crime and the Seven Key Decision Points in recognising and reporting hate crime, established by McDevitt et al. (2000). Hate Crime, Hate Incident, Bias Crime and Prejudicial Discrimination are all phrases associated with the classification of acts that target a victim for an aspect of their identity. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in England and Wales (2018) have outlined that race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity and disability are the protected characteristics for hate crime. 
There are two main aspects required in the legislation: first, that the act was a criminal offence, regardless of the motivation of the offender; second, that the act must have in part been committed and motivated out of prejudice towards the victim as a result of their protected characteristic. However, the hostility expressed by the perpetrator can be in many forms and the CPS and courts do not define this but ‘use the everyday understanding of the word which includes ill-will, spite, contempt, prejudice, unfriendliness, antagonism, resentment and dislike’ (CPS, 2018: 1). Thus the total definition of such an act is complex, subjective and potentially confusing, including establishing if the incident is a crime or not in its own right without the perceived hate elements.
The Welsh context
The Welsh Government established a Framework for Action to eliminate hostility and prejudice and to focus on early prevention to stop incidents escalating into crimes. This is supported by three strategies, prevention, supporting victims and improving multi-agency response, each with specific deliverables such as tackling hate-related bullying and promoting respect and delivering training and awareness in service delivery, for example specifying teacher education within this area within Wales and improving reporting rates (Welsh Government, 2018). As will be seen throughout this article the need for a fuller awareness by both victims and within the support services is crucial. The Welsh Government also works with the UK Government’s action plan Challenge It, Report It, Stop It! in non-devolved areas (Welsh Government, 2018). Following both national policy and the Welsh focus on multiagency working, third-party reporting schemes are used. Online systems are in place to report hate crime, that are heavily promoted by lobbying, and community interest groups through the internet and social media, such as Tell Mama, Stonewall, Stop Hate UK, Victim Support, in addition to the Home Office scheme True Vision and in Wales Victim Support Cymru.
The indicator most utilised for understanding rates of hate crime are the incidents reported to the police, who then refer them on to various other agencies for information and action. The situation within Wales is that victims of hate crime can report the occurrences directly to the police primarily using the 101 or 999 telephone numbers or other methods. Victims have the option of submitting a report online directly to the police through ‘True Vision’, the England and Wales third-party reporting website. Victims may also report directly to Victim Support Cymru, commissioned by the Welsh Government to support victims of hate within Wales and comprise the National Hate Crime Report and Support Centre Wales. The recording system in use in Wales means that when an incident is reported to the police, victim crime data is transferred automatically from the four Welsh police services using a data sharing agreement which is confidential, and involves anonymised data being analysed by the Welsh National Hate Crime Report and Support Centre.
The Welsh Government framework recognises that hate crime is underreported and aims to encourage increased reporting. This is in line with the UK in general, for example True Vision (2016), shows that in Wales there has been an increase of online reports of hate crime through the online mechanism, rising from 31 reports made in 2012/2013 to 120 reports made in 2015/2016. However, Torfaen People First (2012) documented that third-party reporting centres are effective in raising awareness of the issue, but are primarily based in settings, where opportunities to report such incidents already exist: For example, day opportunity centres, community education establishments or services focused upon protection of vulnerable adults. Consequently, the general community continues to have limited knowledge that the third party reporting centres exist. Despite the provision of online reporting, this lack of awareness is a national phenomenon as shown by Police Scotland who on the 17 March 2018 launched a major campaign to increase the awareness amongst potential perpetrators on the impact hate crime has upon victims and consider the damage caused by abuse related to hatred. This campaign was launched as a result of an increase of online reports of hate crime received by Scotland police. Assistant Chief Constable Gillian MacDonald states that, ‘We are aware that hate crime is often under-reported, however, Police Scotland is committed to reviewing and fully investigating all reports of hate.’ What then causes hate crime to be under-reported?
This article is part of an ongoing study into the reporting behaviour of victims in Wales that seeks to understand the complexities faced by victims when choosing to report a hate crime. Having a greater understanding of what motivates a victim of hate crime in Wales to report it, and their rationale for doing so or not reporting, will have a significant impact on the way the police in Wales coordinate activities to improve reporting and target interventions and crime reduction activities.
Barriers to reporting
Accurate identification of hate crimes and overcoming barriers that exist can be analysed using the Seven Key Decision Points (SKDP) as outlined by McDevitt et al. (2000). First, the victim needs to acknowledge that a crime has been committed, and second, the victim must have some perception that the crime may have been motivated by a bias towards them. Third, the matter must be reported to the police by the victim or another party, and fourth, the motivation behind the crime must be brought to the police’s attention. Fifth, the police need to acknowledge and recognise that a bias may have contributed to the motivation, and a sixth potential barrier is that the crime must be documented as a hate crime during the investigation. The last is that the hate crime when finalised must be accurately recorded as such. This section will explore some of the factors influencing each of these decision points and outline the ways in which actions and perceptions at these decision points may erect a barrier to reporting hate crimes and recording them accurately.
Victim perceptions and steps one to four in the SKDP
Victim perception is an important element in the SKDP process: whether the victim sees an incident as a crime, how serious a crime it is and whether they are aware of the hate element within the crime. It may be that victims are subjective when considering if they are victims and this may influence reporting rates. Gottfredson and Gottfredson (1988) identified the role of the victim in reporting based on the victim choices, and Bachman and Coker (1995) demonstrated that reporting behaviours can be linked to how serious the victim perceives the crime to be, with perceived lower-level crimes not being reported. This prompts the question as to where on a scale a victim would place the behaviour before they report as outlined with Allport (1979) considering the idea of ‘extermination’ compared to ‘spoken abuse’ on a five-scale basis. Christmann and Wong (2010) considered individual decision making on the reporting of hate crime based on what resources were available to influence these decisions. These findings demonstrated that victims had a lesser likelihood of making a full report to the police if the incident was non-criminal, as they perceived that the response would not be taken as seriously by the police. With this in mind, David (2000) concluded that if the victim’s perspectives were amended so that self-awareness was increased regarding the issue and the understanding of their needs was highlighted, then reporting behaviour would be increased. Williams and Tregidga (2013) in a study in Wales also found that victims prioritised reporting based on a perception of severity and, furthermore, it extended the decision-making rationale to include if the problem was an isolated incident or an escalating issue. An additional factor highlighted by Wickes et al. (2016) amongst the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) community, is that for some victims, they do not view themselves as a victim of hate crime, merely a victim of crime. Chakraborti et al. (2014) suggests that this lack of awareness of the victim as to what a hate crime is reduces reporting behaviour and that only the more violent acts are reported, such as assaults. This assessment was also documented by Williams and Tregidga (2013), where less serious crimes were seen to go unreported or, as Harlow (2005) suggests, that the matter had been dealt with in another way. Browne et al. (2011) found that avoidance, and remaining in shared social circles, were some responses employed by victims, because of abuse becoming normalised, suggesting that front-line service provision have failed.
A second important victim perception is how the police respond to reporting a hate crime. Balboni and McDevitt (2001) found that where confidence was high between minority groups and the police, hate crime reporting would be increased from these groups, especially where the police had a diverse workforce representing different strands of the community to which they serve. This idea conforms to the concept of ‘procedural justice’ wherein communities engage with the police if they think that they are fair, equitable and respectful (Sunshine and Tyler, 2003).
 Marshall and Webb (1995) considered reported crime rates amongst minority communities and have outlined that minority communities are less likely to consider reporting crime to the police. Terrill et al. (2003) claim this to be a result of negative perceptions of interactions with the police. These perceptions are emphasised through police approaches to arrests and stop-searches when drugs are a factor (Beckett et al., 2006), whereby it is felt that racial minorities are unfairly targeted and are dealt with more vigorously.
 Zaykowski (2010) found that generally minority victims reported less and Harlow (2005) has attempted to link reporting rates to the relationship of the victim and offender and makes the point that over half of crimes committed against victims are carried out by unknown offenders. Herek et al. (1999) demonstrated, despite suggestions that gay victims being more likely to report hate crimes, that overall reporting rates for crimes against gay victims are lower than for non-gay victims. This, they claim, is based on a perception regarding police treatment and the response they would receive based on their sexual orientation. Furthermore, Herek et al. (1999) found when gay victims have a low perception of police response, this reduces the likelihood of reporting the matter. This type of barrier has been coined ‘secondary victimisation’ by Nolan and Akiyama (1999), who believe that victims of anti-gay crime fear citing examples of insensitivity and abuse by police (NYCGL Anti-Violence Project, 1995). Miles-Johnson (2013) considered the Theory of Planned Behaviour (Ajzen, 1985), which is used to link attitudes and beliefs to intention and behaviour, and applied it to measure the willingness of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) victims or persons to report crime to the police in comparison to the wider community. The research showed that LGBTI participants are less likely to report crime to the police because of having a belief that the police are homophobic (Wickes et al., 2016), and reporting rates amongst that group will not improve until these perceptions are positively altered.
An additional factor that hinders reporting is that the victim may fear being stigmatised. Wickes et al. (2016) highlighted that some LGBTI victims, having not identified their sexuality or identity to family, therefore do not have the option available to report a hate crime. These negative perceptions and low confidence in the police have inevitably resulted in an under-reporting of LGBTI crimes to the police (Chakraborti, 2009).
 Saxton et al. (2001) found people with disabilities felt that the police will not believe them and not investigate the matter fully, resulting in greater burdens of stress upon the victim with a disability. Milliner (2014) found in South Wales that some people with learning difficulties were afraid of the uniform and could not approach officers as it was too daunting, and that some would prefer to report via a support worker. She found that others would not even report to their social worker in case they were deemed to be unable to cope and might be further institutionalised. Whereas Sobsey (1994) believes that language and communication barriers exist when people with a disability look to report crimes, which result in less detail being obtained about an incident, which would reduce the likelihood of a remedy being enforced. Milliner (2014) found cases where the victims stated that they were ‘told off’ for reporting incidents. Wickes et al. (2016) looked at language barriers that existed from the authority’s perspective and found that there was a greater need for more inclusive and enabling language around hate crime, to assist in the increasing of hate crime reporting levels, which has also been documented by Langton and Planty (2011).
In a study carried out by the Leicester University Hate Crime Project Chakraborti et al. (2014) participants predominantly outlined that they would not report the matter due to a perception in that the police would not take it seriously or not do anything to resolve the issue. This was also evidenced in an all-Wales-based study (Williams and Tregidga, 2013), which highlighted the same victim perceptions regarding not reporting.
Similarly, Saxton et al. (2001) and Milliner (2014) found that people with disabilities also believed that the police will not believe them and not investigate the matter fully, resulting in greater burdens of stress upon the victim with a disability. This lack of action by the police may also lead to more exposure to retaliation by the criminal. The victim may also hold a perception that rather than dealing with the matter as a criminal investigation, that the police would notify social services. Child et al. (2010) states that previous experiences have influenced the reporting rationale and behaviour of a victim with a disability negatively, and suggested that other victims have not reported, as they do not want to be viewed socially as having a disability. A further barrier may be that some people with a disability believe that to report such abuse is a negative trait and that it is more acceptable for the victim to ignore crimes against them rather than be viewed as a complainer by society (Carlson, 1997).
If victims do not feel that support services can resolve the matter and protect them then they are unlikely to report hate crime. Cantos (2006) documents how victims with a disability feel powerless as victims in a hate crime situation and misperceive that suffering violent encounters are their fault. It could be considered that the more socially isolated the victim living with a disability is, the more likely they are to have a feeling of personal powerlessness, which increases their fear that to report the matter may lead to retaliation by the offender (Petersilia et al., 2001). Fear of retaliation may in some circumstances have a greater meaning, where a victim living with a disability relies upon the offender for care or support due to a disability. This fear may manifest itself as losing independence, or day-to-day functions such as personal hygiene and money management (Petersilia et al., 2001, Andrews and Veronen, 1993). Several studies demonstrated that for some victims, the fear or retaliation hinders the decision to report a hate crime (Chakraborti et al., 2014; Wickes et al., 2016; Wong and Christmann, 2008).
It is therefore clear that fair treatment of victims is required whereby the police validate the victim experiences, which in turn allows victims to feel empowered and able to gain some closure over the incident (Bradford et al., 2013), and by doing so increase reporting behaviour (Sargeant et al., 2014). This is the main element of procedural justice, but more is needed. The victim must have confidence that some meaningful action will be taken and that this will result in fewer hate incidents if victims report more. So, contrary to Hough et al. (2010), efficiency and effectiveness are important factors to increase a victim’s engagement, reporting and support for the police and criminal justice service. This perception may have increased since the Welsh survey following a media campaign in late 2018 (e.g., Wild West Britain out of Control, Daily Mail headline, 2 November 2018) exposing the higher demand on the police service coupled with the reduced number of police officers following 10 years of austerity (Daily Express, 2018). A survey in November 2018 found that 55% of respondents were more concerned about being a victim of crime than they were a year ago (Survation, 2018).
Accurate police identification steps five to seven in the SKDP
 Wickes et al. (2016) states that the police are not always able to identify accurately when a hate crime is taking place. The misidentification of hate crimes by police has been raised previously by McDevitt (1987) and Levin (1992), with some examples citing an unwillingness by the police to raise the profile of a minor case through labelling it as a hate crime, as the investigation may become too burdensome or sensationalise the crime reported. There is also the issue that hate crimes require an assessment of all factors that contribute to the crime to be weighed up and at times this can be subjective, in turn leading to a unique set of issues when attempting to accurately record them (Nolan and Akiyama, 1999), whereas other examples suggested that police officers held the opinion that all crimes of a similar level of severity should be treated equally, and not on the basis of motive (Nolan and Akiyama, 1999). It is this ‘organisational conditioning’ outlined by Levin (1992) that seeks to inhibit the understanding and importance of hate crimes from a community-wide perspective. Assessing the issues that lead to classification errors is particularly important as it ultimately influences the accuracy of National Crime Figures as far as hate crimes are concerned (Nolan et al., 2011). Nolan et al. (2015) demonstrates that the under-counting of hate crimes within official figures was the largest barrier surrounding the accurate picture of hate crime. This has been exacerbated through a plethora of interpretations of the definition of hate crime and how it should be applied not only by victims, but predominantly by different police force areas and organisations and the officers responsible for investigating them.
A focus on the agenda appears to be key also, as Clayton et al. (2016) found that levels of reporting of hate crimes had reduced in line with reduced prioritisation and resourcing. The retrenchment from reduction in resourcing and different typologies of neighbourhood policing (Higgins, 2017) suggests that police officers are more likely to be ‘strangers in uniform’ (Milliner, 2014) and have less time to build up a picture of minor incidents escalating to serious hate crimes. The Welsh government is committed to the continuation of Community Support Officers via ring-fenced funding to maintain CSO numbers within neighbourhood policing teams. Unfortunately, a discussion on the future of neighbourhood policing, which the authors feel to be a major element in recognising and supporting victims, is beyond the scope of this article. However, the balance between reactive and preventative policing is a major question for the police service, as is whether the recent signal from the UK government to increase policing budgets (Knowles, 2018) will be sufficient to halt the retrenchment away from neighbourhood policing.
The Welsh study
Service providers survey
As part of the Welsh government’s framework for action on hate crime, training sessions were delivered to 24 groups with 113 participants from across service providers operating in Wales, between November 2014 and March 2015, which included housing, local authorities, police services, Crown Prosecution Service, the probation service, the National Health Service, Citizens Advice and the voluntary sector. Although all service providers were experienced practitioners, a one-hour awareness session on hate crime to ensure that each participant was fully aware of the term and its legal definition (an overview of s. 145 and 146 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003) was given immediately before the focus groups, including an explanation of each of the five protected characteristics covered by the definition of hate crime, in addition to a hate crime case study for each of the five protected characteristics. These comprised: Brent Martin targeted for having a disability, Jonny Delany targeted and murdered for being a Gypsy Traveller, Lee Rigby murdered by al Qaeda-influenced individuals, Jodi Dobrowski murdered for being perceived as gay and Dee Jenkins targeted for gender transitioning from male to female. Participants also received five case studies, anonymised referrals into the National Hate Crime Report and Support Centre Wales (one per protected characteristic covered by the hate crime definition).
This provided potential respondents for a study with a consistent level of knowledge. From this, 24 focus groups were coordinated, with 113 participants providing consent to utilise their responses, to identify how front-line services within Wales perceived the way in which victims report hate crime and use their experience as a front-line service to suggest why victims do not report. Essentially this data represents the Welsh front-line service position on perceived barriers of reporting hate and suggestions on how to remove such barriers.
Participants had 10 minutes to discuss with other participants within the focus group what barriers they believe may exist that prevent a victim of hate crime reporting the occurrence to a front-line or emergency service. The participants were then asked to provide their responses verbally; these were written on a flipchart visible to the participants at the front of the room. Once all of the responses were clearly displayed on the flipchart, the participants were given a further 10 minutes to discuss ways in which these barriers could be removed or mitigated to enable a victim to report a hate crime. Participants then gave their responses verbally when prompted against each barrier previously identified, and these were recorded on the flipchart accordingly. An independent person (GC) ran the focus groups as All Wales Hate Crime Manager to try to remove any fear of any individual’s comments or attitudes being fed back into their organisation. The aim was for open discussion, but the authors acknowledge that focus groups may limit individuals’ truthfulness and full participation by all members.
Victims survey
Victim Support Cymru (VSC) collects data routinely, and a victim’s data and experience are transferred automatically between the four police forces in Wales and VSC. There is a clear service-level agreement in place for the process, and it is inclusive of implied consent for the victim to be contacted. The victim is therefore automatically opted in, both to be contacted for an offer of support services and for this research to be carried out using their data, unless they request to opt out.
Under this arrangement a series of seven questions were formulated to identify the reporting rationale of victims of hate crime. To ensure the most immediate response from the victim to encapsulate the raw emotion and feelings, thereby generating a more genuine emotional response, the questions were asked at the point of initial contact with the victim, which is within 48 hours of reporting the crime. Asking at initial contact also ensures the welfare of the victim, as they are provided with immediate emotional support to help them overcome the crime and a needs assessment is carried out to see what additional support they may require. The operators whom carry out the initial contact are trained in hate crime and only contact such victims. The questions were fully explained to the staff and they were supervised during the calls to ensure data quality and consistency was maintained. Victims were informed that they can opt out at any time and a unique reference number was created to ensure that the responses recorded were anonymous. The responses were entered into an Excel document and grouped into categories with the most appropriate heading.
This is a sensitive issue, and victims contacted within 48 hours of an incident may not want to reveal fully all their thoughts and feelings. Thus it may be that some victims did not fully engage in their responses. Furthermore, this data is from those who have reported, as this methodology does not reach non-reporting victims. Nonetheless, lessons can be learned from these respondents. The short time-lapse between incident and interview should provide a fuller, richer and more accurate recall and hence should remove some memory/recall inaccuracies that might be associated with annual surveys such as the CSEW.
A comparison of motivating factors between England and Wales
The distribution of reasons for hate crimes in Wales is different to that in England: Table 1 shows a higher percentage based upon the protected characteristics of both sexual orientation and disability and lower percentages for both race and religion. As discussed above, reporting barriers may be different for each of these categories. Disability hate crime is particularly more frequent in the Welsh survey, and in all surveys racial hate crime is dominant.

3047 hate-motivating factors in Wales driving the 2941 recorded offences. *England excludes BTP which covers a wider area. Prevalence is indeterminate as the population numbers of different categories is unknown. Home Office (2017).
 Cuerden and Rogers (2015) found that males are almost twice as likely to report hate crime. In terms of age profile, the ages that range between 16 and 45 have the highest levels of reporting, accounting for 64% of the sample, with the greatest concentration stemming from the 26 to 35 age range (24.3%).
It is worth noting that the 16 to 25 age range has the second highest level of reporting (18.1%). This, Cuerden and Rogers (2015) suggest, may be due to awareness-type education in schools and colleges, which has been commonly seen across Wales since the implementation of the Welsh Government Hate Crime Framework. A recent ‘Resilience’ intervention, funded by the Welsh government, has started to further promote diversity and ethics within Welsh schools. Alternatively, this age group may experience higher rates of hate crimes, with 90% of Scottish children with learning difficulties experiencing bullying at school (Enable Scotland, 2017).
Comparisons of victims and service providers perceptions
Data obtained from VSC between 18 August 2015 and 26 September 2016 gathered 197 consenting victims of hate crime. Due to some participants providing multiple responses, it should be noted that there was a total of 209 victim responses within Table 2 and 206 victim responses in Table 3. Tables 2 and 3 contrast the views of the 113 service providers with those of hate crime reporting victims.

This mapping is based upon the authors’ understanding of the sentiments expressed by the two groups.
The seriousness of the crime may also affect the reporting rate. Corcoran et al. (2015) found that overall, 48% of hate crime incidents were reported to the police, and that this was similar to the proportion of hate crimes in previous CSEW surveys. This is a higher figure than for overall CSEW crime in the same time periods, which was 40%. Corcoran et al. (2015) suggest that this is due to different patterns of seriousness of hate crimes compared to crime overall; for example, violent crime in general has higher reporting rates and this is a higher proportion of hate crimes reported (49% of hate compared 19% of overall CSEW crime). Supporting this relationship, it is found that reporting to the police for theft incidents overall is a lower figure (40%). A very similar pattern was found in this Welsh survey of victims where, Assault Occasioning Bodily Harm was experienced in 48% of the crimes, followed by harassment (29%) and public order offences (16%). These higher reported rates of hate violence may reflect the earlier findings that violent crime is more likely to be reported or that victims of hate crime are more likely to suffer violence within hate crimes. Until the reporting rate for hate crime improves, this question cannot be determined.
As can be seen clearly in Table 2, the main barrier for victims is the ‘police’ which makes up 33.5% of the total responses. This category encapsulated feelings that to report an issue would be ‘a waste of police time’; that the ‘Police won’t do anything’; ‘the police do not take the matter seriously’; ‘a poor police service has been received previously’; that ‘nothing will get done’ and that there are ‘bad relations with the police’. This can be compared with other studies in Table 2, which also show this category to be the main barrier to reporting in other UK studies.
 Corcoran et al. (2015) found from the combined 2012/13 to 2014/15 CSEW surveys, that 52% of hate crime victims were very or fairly satisfied with how the police handled their report, a lower rate than for victims of crime overall (73% very or fairly satisfied). Conversely, hate crime victims had a higher rate of being very dissatisfied (35%) with the police handling their case than the overall victim response in the CSEW (14%). This may again be partially related to a different pattern of crimes committed to hate crime victims, as discussed above. Corcoran et al. (2015) compared satisfaction of victims of violent hate crime with the police (46% were very or fairly satisfied) to that of victims of overall violent crime incidents (68%), showing a considerably lower level of satisfaction. However, they do point out that the violent hate crime responses are from a relatively small dataset.
 Corcoran et al. (2015: 22) also found from the combined 2012/13 to 2014/15 surveys that: victims of hate crime were less likely to think the police had treated them fairly or with respect, compared with victims of CSEW crime overall. For example, in 59 per cent of hate crime incidents the victims thought the police treated them fairly, compared with 81 per cent of incidents of CSEW crime overall. Similarly, in 79 per cent of incidents of hate crime, victims thought the police treated them with respect, compared with 89 per cent of incidents of CSEW crime overall. Thus the findings in this study agree with those of previous studies that show that hate crime victims find that the police response is poor and in need of major improvement.
Equally worryingly, 14.8% of the victims feel that hate crimes have become a normalised part of life and that, as such, to report them would mean nothing, as they occur so frequently. Again, the comparisons show that this is an important factor in the other UK studies. The Suffolk Hate Crime Survey in 2012 found a very similar rate, and these are both considerably higher than that found in the earlier CSEW (Table 2). This increase may be due to time, a motivating factor of regional/cultural differences.
Furthermore, hate crime victims have been found to be more negatively affected by the crime experienced than is generally the case, with Corcoran et al. (2015) reporting that victims of hate crime more frequently stated that they were emotionally affected by the incident (92% and 81% respectively) and also responded as ‘very much’ affected at a considerably higher rate (36% and 13% respectively). This analysis also suggests that this higher level of emotional impact is not due to the type of hate crimes experienced, as victims of violent crime tend to be less likely to say they were emotionally affected than victims of other crime types.
Fear of reprisal may be increasing over time, with response rates of 3.6% in 2009–2011 (CSEW) 9.9% in 2012 (Suffolk) and 17.7% in 2016 (Wales), unless the crime type mapping proposed within Table 2 is too compartmentalised, with ‘Afraid’ and ‘Private issue dealt with ourselves’ also being to avoid reprisal and hence overlapping with ‘Repercussions’. If this is the case, the trend is fairly constant across time. with values of 17.1% in 2009–2011 (CSEW) 15.5% in 2012 (Suffolk) but 33.5% in 2016 (Wales) perhaps showing a regional or motivating factor (particular type of hate) variation in the Welsh response.
Other factors, such as fear of reporting itself, continue to present themselves as barriers. However, there are more intricate examples provided, such as a ‘fuelling of the issue by the media’ and that the process from reporting to desired outcome seems ‘too slow’, perhaps an indicator of changes in standards expected or a torch-light on an ever-criticised area of policing. As discussed above, the level of police funding and changing emphasis on preventive policing may be important factors in supporting victims and reporting rates. In a recent Survation survey, 81% of respondents favoured increasing police officer numbers, reflecting the greater fear of crime found in the survey. This in turn may lead to lower reporting rates as the media emphasises the lack of police capacity to attend all reported crime.
A small percentage (2.4%) state that feelings of being ashamed are causing an inhibition to report, prompting questions as to whether social change is what is really needed to facilitate true cohesion and understanding to the complexities contained within crimes of bias and prejudice. This factor was not revealed within the earlier studies, although inhibitions due to cultural norms in specific groups such as the Gypsy and Traveller community, the Chinese community and the Polish community have been identified (Wong et al., 2013).
Welsh service providers gave the same main reason for non-reporting by victims of hate crime – that of poor police response, including all the factors mentioned earlier, such as not being believed, poor relations and lack of trust with the police, lack of action by the police etc. However, Welsh service providers had a much higher belief that ‘fear’ and ‘shame’ were barriers than the victims’ responses (e.g. Fear 27.5% vs 15.8%). Furthermore, they had a response of 7.4% around communication barriers and not knowing how to report, a level which is not revealed in any of the other three victim surveys in Table 2. Furthermore, despite the higher frequency of disability hate crime within the Welsh sample, only 1% of the victims gave this reason. This may be because those with communication barriers under-report, relative to those not experiencing such a barrier, or that service providers are out of tune with victims’ feelings. Overall, there is a considerable mismatch between victims’ and providers’ beliefs within Wales.
When Welsh service providers were asked how such perceived barriers may be removed, as shown in Table 3, providers suggest that to ‘market support’ and to ‘make staff aware of procedures’ are the most prevalent concepts. A further suggestion, to ‘explain confidentiality’, was voiced, despite the need for the victim to attend court when pursuing a criminal complaint; perhaps this response was referring to the need to improve ‘trust’ and to demonstrate that organisations are listening to victims’ needs and taking the topic seriously. ‘Build trust’ only represented 10.7% of the service providers’ responses, which seems very low if service providers were seeking to provide procedural justice for the victims.
How, then, do the victim responses differ from service providers’ responses and perceptions? Table 3 highlights that victims see the need for a more ‘open door’ approach by the police, so that the public is better able to see how the police respond in these matters and the different aspects of policing involved in dealing with the matter (39.7%), versus the service providers’ main response of marketing support (39.3%), which would appear to be expressing similar sentiments. Second from the victims’ perspective is the need for action to be taken promptly and effectively when a matter is reported (17.5%), suggesting that the victims sampled have considered the response received following reporting the hate crime to be less than they would expect. Support also features in victim (12.1%) responses, and these two aspects map against service providers’ response of ‘Staff aware of procedures’ (26.2%), to maximise the response and support given to victims. However, it is notable that victims require more swift and harsher punitive action to be taken against offenders (10.2%), coupled with feelings that the current mechanisms to report hate are not considered safe during and following a report being made (6.8%), yet these issues are not found in the service providers’ feedback. There is also an aspect of ownership of reporting, with victims feeling that more should be done surrounding empowerment, so that victims can help themselves, and service providers thought that more education would reduce barriers reflecting this issue. Such a response could be an indicator that as a result of policing processes and perceived inadequate timescales and punishments for the problem, that the public have lost faith in the system and are seeking to regain control. To facilitate empowerment and help stem repeat hate incidents, perhaps restorative justice should be used alongside punishment of perpetrators.
A sample of five responses taken from the victim responses will enrich the meaning behind the data: ‘Have a campaign so that everyone can report these things together to try and encourage people. Let them know that they are not alone. Better media portrayal of police as the media show they are dropping in standards and procedures.’‘For the police to have a solid procedure that they adhere to with every case of hate crime. Not to brush it under the carpet like it’s nothing and to protect the victim and not to sympathise with the offender. For the police to show impartiality and to not show any tendencies of discrimination themselves. Police to build a rapport with victims. Victims knowing that organisations are going to help them when they promise them support and help, rather than promising and not doing anything – it creates mistrust.’‘To be reassured that if they report it that it would be taken seriously. For the police to realise that hate crime can be very distressing for victims and for them to show the same compassion as VSC towards victims, by seeing their side of the argument and sympathising with them. Just because it’s a verbal altercation doesn’t mean it can’t have the same negative effects on victims as larger and more “serious” crimes.’‘Make sure that victims know that they are safe when they report and that something is going to be done about it – more than just a warning. Police do a good job currently but historically people don’t have much faith in them, particularly the groups of people that are victims of hate crime as the police have also discriminated against them in the past.’‘Improve society’s views on different ethnic cultures to improve people’s ignorance and understandings of others, it is narrowmindedness that causes hate crime and racism and that needs to be changed as we currently live in a very hostile country for any ethnicity other than British.’
The victim’s responses suggest a lack of confidence in the Criminal Justice Service to serve and protect the victim, i.e. a lack of procedural justice and police legitimacy. Considering the Seven Key Decision Points (McDevitt et al., 2000), in this study steps one and two have been taken by the victims of hate crime who reported (the sample). Step three is a major barrier to respondents, with victims perceiving that reporting a hate incident to the police is not going to help them and may make matters worse. This latter aspect – a lack of efficiency – appears to be an equally important aspect to fair treatment and is runs counter to some proponents of procedural justice, who claim that this is not an important factor.
Furthermore, with regard to steps five to seven, improved understanding, sensitivity and empathy are required by the police and other service providers to support the victim in their time of need. This may be a severe challenge to retrain and find time to fully support victims when front-line providers are dealing with ever-increasing demands and static or decreasing resources.
Conclusion
There is a clear endorsement looking at the data that ‘procedural justice’ as outlined by Sunshine and Tyler (2003) needs improvement within Wales to ensure communities engage with the police and other agencies when considering reporting hate incidents. Herek et al. (1999) support this study’s findings that there is low perception of a positive and successful police response leading to a reduced likelihood of reporting. It is interesting that victims feel that a greater transparency of the police response is needed, which further endorses this sentiment.
Additional data in this study supports the following notions: that for some, behaviours are being normalised (Browne et al., 2011); that fear is also documented in the data as a barrier experienced in reporting, either as fear of repercussions or because of what reporting means to them (Chakraborti et al., 2014; Wickes et al., 2016; Wong and Christmann, 2008); and that there is a lack of awareness among some victims of what a hate crime is (Chakraborti et al., 2014).
The research demonstrate that victims perceive that social change is required and that the justice system is unsympathetic, too slow and inefficient in dealing with the issue, with harsher and swifter punishments being required to effect trust in the system.
There is also an obvious difference between the victim perspective and the service provider perspective on the matter of reporting barriers and solutions, emphasising that more should be done to bridge the gap between the two cohorts.
Although the data presented is only an early interrogation of the data, it does bring new learning and reinforces literature from within the field. A full analysis of the data obtained and the new perspectives it brings will be published in due course. For now, however, there is a definitive need for police to validate victim experiences in which empowerment and trust are gained (Bradford et al., 2013).

RICHMOND, Va. - Twelve people were arrested and charged with participating in an unlawful assembly after police said they refused orders to disperse from in front of Richmond City Hall.
Police arrived around midnight Monday to address the occupation of protesters, who had been distributing flyers indicating they planned to stay in place for the long term, the department said in a statement Tuesday afternoon.
The protesters threw traffic cones, barricades and concrete trash cans into the street, used vehicles to block off the street, set up tents in front of the entrances to city hall and threw rocks and other objects at the officers, the department said.
Officers used tear gas, pepper spray and flash bangs to disperse the crowd. The department did not address those measures in its statement and didn't immediately respond to an inquiry from The Associated Press.
One of the protesters was charged with four counts of assault on a law enforcement officer, according to the department.
The gathering had started forming after state officials announced the grounds of a monument to Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee would be indefinitely closed from sunset until sunrise every night.

YPSILANTI, Mich. - A Michigan mayor resigned Tuesday, a week after she said she supported the appointment of a human relations commissioner only because she would be ""crucified"" if she voted against a Black person.
Former Ypsilanti Mayor Beth Bashert said she was ""deeply sorry"" to have her tenure end on that note. She said as a result of her actions ""there is healing to do to ensure that all residents, including Black, Indigenous, and people of colour, enjoy full equity"" in the city.
The controversy began last week when the city council was voting on the reappointment of Ka'Ron Gaines to a commission that advises the council on eliminating prejudice and discrimination. Gaines' inconsistent attendance record was raised by some council members. Bashert, who is white, voted in favour of his appointment but the others voted no, including three who are Black.
Basher said that ""since I will be crucified if I vote against any Black person on any commission, I'm going to vote 'yes.'""
Bashert subsequently apologized and said she was ""deeply ashamed and saddened"" by her remarks.

CINCINNATI -- The University of Cincinnati is removing Marge Schott's name from its baseball stadium and a library archive in light of her racist comments while owner of the Cincinnati Reds.
The school's board of trustees unanimously approved the move Tuesday. It comes 12 days after a Catholic high school also decided to remove references to Schott from its facilities.

FORT WAYNE, Ind. - An Indiana county councilman has resigned days after he sparked outrage by saying during a council meeting that Black Lives Matter protesters were ""uneducated"" and lamented that they ""breed.""
Republican Allen County councilman Larry Brown resigned Monday, according to the county party chairman.
Numerous groups had demanded Brown's resignation after he made the comments last Thursday during a council meeting where members discussed whether they should issue a statement regarding the protests. His remarks were captured on video cameras and broadcast on Facebook.
Brown later apologized for his remarks, but he declined an email request for comment from The Associated Press on Tuesday, stating, ""Everything I say is being taken out of context and used against my family and me.""

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. - The St. Augustine City Commission will relocate a Confederate memorial that's been in its central plaza for 140 years.
The commission voted 3-2 Monday night. The decision came after weeks of demonstrations across the country against police brutality and racism.
""I don't think that memorial represents who we are as a community we aspire to be,"" said Mayor Tracy Upchurch, a former state legislator who also teaches law and history.
The memorial obelisk bears the names of Confederate soldiers. It's been a focus of protests in St. Augustine, a city of 15,000 that traces its origins to 1565, when Spanish explorers established an outpost along the northern Atlantic coast of what is now Florida.
Upchurch says George Floyd's death is more than a conversation about police misconduct and Confederate monuments.
""It is a call to us to face with open hearts the racism that's existed in our country since its founding. African slaves have been here from the very beginning, and we're still struggling with these issues,"" she said. ""The plaza is literally our heart and soul -- and that's where this obelisk stands -- in the centre of our community.""
The monument is located in the Plaza de la Constitucion, near the Catholic cathedral and a government building.

SEATTLE - Police in Seattle are investigating another shooting near the city's ""occupied"" protest zone.
A spokesperson at Harborview Medical Center says the man's wounds were not life-threatening. The shooting happened around 5 a.m. Tuesday in the Capitol Hill neighbourhood east of downtown.
It's the third recent shooting near the protest zone. Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan said Monday the city will move to wind down the protest zone. The mayor said the violence was distracting from changes sought by thousands of peaceful protesters opposing racial inequity and police brutality.
Durkan also said police will soon return to a police station that the department largely abandoned in the area after clashes with protesters following George Floyd's death at the hands of Minneapolis police.

JUNEAU, Alaska - Petitioners have called for the removal of a statue in Alaska of the U.S. cabinet secretary who arranged the purchase of the state's land from Russia.
The Juneau Empire reports Jennifer LaRoe launched the Change.org petition to remove the William H. Seward statue. So far, it has 1,300 signatures.
The $250,000 statue unveiled in 2017 shows Seward holding the 1867 Treaty of Cession authorizing the Alaska Territory sale to the U.S. from the Russian Empire.
LaRoe acknowledged Seward's role as an abolitionist in President Abraham Lincoln's administration but says the statue is a symbol of white, patriarchal authority and the disenfranchisement of Alaska Natives.

MINNEAPOLIS - Minneapolis police union president Bob Kroll called the bystander video of the death of George Floyd ""horrific"" while cautioning the public not to rush to judgment.
The union has been mostly silent about Floyd's death since issuing a statement soon after he died on May 25 after a police officer kneeled on his neck for nearly eight minutes. Kroll said Tuesday on ""CBS This Morning"" he thinks union members are being scapegoated for incompetent department leadership.
Kroll says the union has been denied its right to review officer body-camera video. Union director Rich Walker says ""any human being"" watching the video knows Floyd's arrest ""should not have ended the way it did."" But Walker questioned statements that Floyd didn't resist officers because the union hasn't seen footage of the minutes leading up to the bystander video showed.
Police chief Medaria Arradondo said after Floyd's death that he's pausing contract negotiations with the union to consider major changes. Anna Hedberg, another union director, says the union had been having ""great conversations"" with city leaders and Arradondo before Floyd's death.
She says it's ""dumbfounding to me that one incident, we become the scapegoat to having a bad officer.""
Ex-officer Derek Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder. Three other officers at the scene are charged with aiding and abetting.

WASHINGTON - Americans overwhelmingly want clear standards for police on when officers may use force and consequences imposed on officers who do so excessively.
That's according to a new poll from the The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research that finds Americans favour significant changes to the country's criminal justice system. Americans are largely united behind the idea that action is required: 40% say it needs ""major changes;"" 29% think the criminal justice system needs ""a complete overhaul"" and 25% say it needs ""minor changes."" Just 5% believe no changes are necessary.
The poll also finds there is strong support for penalizing officers who engage in racially biased policing. Americans are more likely now than five years ago to say that police violence against the public is a very serious problem and that officers who cause injury or death on the job are treated too leniently.
The survey of American adults took place after weeks of mass demonstrations against police violence and calls from some politicians and activists to ""defund"" police departments in response to the death of George Floyd.

DES MOINES, Iowa -The Des Moines City Council unanimously approved an anti-racial profiling ordinance that prohibits biased policing and requires city employees to report violations by officers.
Some supporters say the vote Monday night was only a first step and officials need to take additional actions.
The ordinance prohibits discriminatory pretextual stops, in which drivers are stopped for one infraction but charged with a different infraction. Many residents who spoke before the council voted wanted all pretextual stops banned.
The ordinance also mandates additional officer training, requires city employees to report incidents of biased policing they witness and creates a board with community members that helps the city manager review data and make policy recommendations.
Daniel Zeno, policy and advocacy director at the American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa, says passage of the measure was a good step. He'd also like to see a citizen oversight committee.
For years, advocates have been calling for the council to approve such an ordinance. Officials began working on the new rules following protests of George Floyd's death at the hands of police in Minneapolis.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. - Authorities in North Carolina say a shooting at an impromptu block party has left two people dead and seven others wounded.
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Deputy Chief Johnny Jennings told reporters early Monday the shooting happened around midnight at a block party that was a continuation of Juneteenth celebrations. Jennings said police responding to a pedestrian call found hundreds of people in the streets.
After authorities arrived, several shots were fired and the crowd scattered. Jennings said five people were hit by cars while running away from the shooting. He said there was evidence of multiple shooters.
Further details weren't immediately available.

SEATTLE - Police in Seattle say one person has been wounded in the second shooting in Seattle's protest zone in less than 48 hours.
The shooting happened late Sunday night in the area near Seattle's downtown area known as CHOP, for ""Capitol Hill Occupied Protest."" Police tweeted that one person was at a hospital with a gunshot wound. A hospital spokesperson says the person was in serious condition.
A pre-dawn shooting Saturday had left a 19-year-old man dead and another person critically injured. No arrests in that shooting had been made as of Sunday.
The CHOP zone is a several-block area cordoned off by protesters near a police station in the city's Capitol Hill neighbourhood that evolved after weeks of protests in the city over police brutality and racism, sparked by the police killing of George Floyd, a Black man, in Minneapolis.

NEW YORK - A New York City police officer was suspended without pay Sunday after he was recorded putting his arm around a man's neck in what the police commissioner called an ""apparent chokehold.""
The department's action to suspend the officer was stunning in its swiftness, occurring just hours after the morning confrontation on a beach boardwalk in the Rockaway section of Queens.
A video shot by one of the men involved showed a group of officers tackling a Black man, with one of them putting his arm around his neck as he lay face-down on the boardwalk.
In the video, someone yells, ""Stop choking him, bro!"" The officer relaxes his grip after a fellow officer taps him and pulls on his shirt.
It was unclear whether the man who was tackled suffered more than superficial injuries. He stood under his own power after he got off the ground and refused to let medics examine him after the incident.
The NYPD has long banned chokeholds. Their use has been especially fraught since the 2014 death of Eric Garner after an officer put him in a chokehold while trying to arrest him.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo recently signed into law a sweeping package of police accountability measures including a ban on chokeholds following protests over George Floyd's killing.",Bias Incident

RICHMOND, Va. — Twelve people were arrested and charged with participating in an unlawful assembly after police said they refused orders to disperse from in front of Richmond City Hall.
Police arrived around midnight Monday to address the occupation of protesters, who had been distributing flyers indicating they planned to stay in place for the long term, the department said in a statement Tuesday afternoon.
The protesters threw traffic cones, barricades and concrete trash cans into the street, used vehicles to block off the street, set up tents in front of the entrances to city hall and threw rocks and other objects at the officers, the department said.
Officers used tear gas, pepper spray and flash bangs to disperse the crowd. The department did not address those measures in its statement and didn’t immediately respond to an inquiry from The Associated Press.
One of the protesters was charged with four counts of assault on a law enforcement officer, according to the department.
The gathering had started forming after state officials announced the grounds of a monument to Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee would be indefinitely closed from sunset until sunrise every night.

YPSILANTI, Mich. — A Michigan mayor resigned Tuesday, a week after she said she supported the appointment of a human relations commissioner only because she would be “crucified” if she voted against a Black person.
Former Ypsilanti Mayor Beth Bashert said she was “deeply sorry” to have her tenure end on that note. She said as a result of her actions “there is healing to do to ensure that all residents, including Black, Indigenous, and people of color, enjoy full equity” in the city.
The controversy began last week when the city council was voting on the reappointment of Ka’Ron Gaines to a commission that advises the council on eliminating prejudice and discrimination. Gaines’ inconsistent attendance record was raised by some council members. Bashert, who is white, voted in favor of his appointment but the others voted no, including three who are Black.
Basher said that “since I will be crucified if I vote against any Black person on any commission, I’m going to vote ‘yes.’”
Bashert subsequently apologized and said she was “deeply ashamed and saddened” by her remarks.

This article sets out how a critical hate studies perspective can explain and illuminate the hate harms experienced by Gypsies and Travellers in the UK. In doing so, it directly responds to the question of how criminological theory can move beyond existing debates in studies of race and ethnicity and engage more effectively with the wider social sciences. The critical hate studies perspective provides a comprehensive theoretical approach to appreciating the harms of hate in late modernity. This framework challenges existing explanations for bias-motivated violence in society and proposes an approach that acknowledges the overarching role of neoliberal capitalism on individual subjectivity and subsequently the lived experience. By utilising this perspective, it is possible here to discuss the range and depth of hate experienced by Gypsies and Travellers and thus consider its genesis and the potential for positive praxis.
FULL TEXT
Introduction
Studies of bias-motivated offending in criminology, termed as ‘hate studies’, have given rise to a plethora of research on the parameters of such crimes (see Hall, 2013; Perry, 2001) and their symbolic capacity within criminal justice processes (Mason, 2013). Further, hate studies have provided the opportunity for criminology to consider the boundaries of its project (Jenness and Grattet, 2001), identifying the necessity for criminology to re-engage with issues of racism (Dixon and Ray, 2007), and the social harms engendered by bias-motivated behaviours that are not defined as crimes (Tombs, 2018). With the intention of furthering discussion in this area, this article identifies the harms of hate experienced by Gypsies and Travellers that are multiple and varied, normalized and complex. By utilizing a critical hate studies approach (James and McBride, 2018) and drawing on empirical data gathered in a rural area of England, the article considers explanations for the hate experienced by Gypsies and Travellers. The harms of hate discussed here constitute subjective harms that manifest as crimes, systemic harms that are inherent within processes and structures of governance, and symbolic harms expressed via speech and language (Žižek, 2008). The article is therefore able to present a critical analysis of hate harms that recognizes the human need to flourish, rather than simply to survive, in late modernity.
The article will initially set out the existing ‘problem’ presented by Gypsies and Travellers, wherein their experiences of criminalization and victimization overlap and must be considered within the context of the tensions between (and misunderstandings of) sedentarism and nomadism. The article specifically deals with issues of race, crime and victimization by virtue of discussing the diverse communities represented by the limiting moniker of ‘Gypsies and Travellers’. Further, the article acknowledges and challenges hierarchies of difference that exist within legislation, policies and practice, and considers how a more nuanced approach, informed by the perspectives of Gypsies and Travellers themselves serves better to appreciate their lived experience (Phillips and Bowling, 2008). The article then goes on to provide a framework for analysis that is informed by ultra-realist criminology (Hall and Winlow, 2015).1 In doing so, the article responds to a call for critical thinking within hate studies (Perry, 2006).
The harms of hate are elaborated in this article in relation to the realms of recognition human subjects require to flourish, that are love, esteem and respect (Yar, 2012). By approaching the harms of hate in this way, it is possible to identify and draw out the omnipresence of neoliberal capitalism on the lived experiences of Gypsies and Travellers as its vagaries serve to block access to true recognition of human needs (Honneth, 1996). The article, therefore, identifies how criminological theory can move beyond existing debates in studies of race and ethnicity and engage more effectively with the wider social sciences, specifically psychology and sociology. In doing so, the article intends to identify a nuanced approach that acknowledges the unique nature of Gypsies’ and Travellers’ experiences as a specific minority perspective. However, the article also makes a universal point about the nature of human subjectivities based on a consideration of the fundamental formation of the human self.
Methodology
The theoretical approach here is based on a comprehensive reading of literature in the areas of identity, hate studies, criminology and Romani studies. In order to illuminate the theoretical framework the article draws on evidence gathered in 2015 on the harms of hate experienced by Gypsies and Travellers that was part of a wider research study on the accommodation needs of Gypsies and Travellers in the south-west of England (Southern et al., 2015). In agreement with the study funders,2 that research incorporated a small survey of Gypsies’ and Travellers’ experiences of hate behaviours, including both hate incidents and hate crimes. The survey gathered data on what had happened and whether Gypsies and Travellers had reported the hate they had experienced to any formal or community reporting agencies, and if not, why not. The survey data incorporated closed and open questions on numbers of hate behaviours, as well as their locations, reporting, responses of agencies reported to and perceptions of hate victimization. A Gypsy and Traveller support organization carried out the survey alongside the wider accommodation needs assessment. Respondents completed the survey themselves or received support to complete the survey so that all those sampled could contribute to the research, no matter their levels of literacy (McCaffery, 2009).
The Gypsy and Traveller accommodation assessment was completed by 187 people who lived in a range of accommodation including those who normally resided on approved sites as well as those who lived in illegal spaces. Because there is no existing sampling frame for this population, a snowball sample was utilized which targeted groups in known sites in the first instance and used their contacts to access other, harder to reach, Gypsies and Travellers. Although snowball sampling can be considered unrepresentative, it is a reasonably valid strategy that was sensitive to the shifting population and enabled access to be gained to people living on authorized sites, unauthorized spaces, transit spaces and in bricks and mortar accommodation that tend to be the hardest groups to access (Sturgis, 2008). Of the 187 people that completed the accommodation needs assessment, 79 chose to answer the hate crime questions. Given the high number of questions in the accommodation needs assessment (54 questions) and thus the time taken to complete it, it was surprising and actually gratifying that 79 people were additionally prepared to answer the hate crime questions. It should also be noted that on two incomplete surveys notes were found stating, ‘fearful of repercussion’. Those people who chose to answer the questions self-identified as Romany Gypsies (41%), New Travellers (53%) and others, including Show people (6%), reflecting the proportions of the wider sample of Gypsies and Travellers in the accommodation needs assessment.
In addition to the survey, the research team followed up the hate crime survey with a small number of requests for interviews with respondents. Subsequently, three in-depth interviews with Romany Gypsy and New Travellers were completed. These telephone interviews each lasted for at least an hour and addressed a range of issues highlighted by the survey component of the research.
The ‘problem’ of Gypsies and Travellers
Gypsies, Travellers and Roma constitute the largest minority in Europe (Council of Europe, 2011) and Gypsies and Travellers in the UK have been approximated to comprise 1.5% of the UK population (Greenfields and Smith, 2009). Defining the population of Gypsies and Travellers in the UK has been notoriously problematic. Although in the 2011 census space was provided for those of Romany Gypsy and Irish Traveller status to self-identify, research suggests that those 63,000 people who completed the survey does not equate to their population in full (Cromarty, 2018). Indeed, one of the controversial, and arguably divisive, issues within Gypsy and Traveller studies is the determination of who qualifies as having Gypsy or Traveller identity and thus status. Policy and planning in this regard have served to confuse discussion and identification, and consequently the statistics. Race relations legislation acknowledges Romany Gypsies, Irish Travellers and Scottish Travellers as deserving protection as specific ethnic groups.3 New Travellers and other Travellers, such as Show people, are not protected by this legislation, despite their inter-generational cultural nomadism4 and their ethnicity in the case of Show people (LeedsGATE, 2019). Further, planning policy determines ‘travellers’ [sic] as only those people that are mobile and thus has negated the status of many Gypsies and Travellers, including those recognized as ethnic groups, for planning purposes if they stop travelling on a permanent basis. As noted by James and Southern (2019), this policy has potentially damaging consequences for the most vulnerable Gypsies and Travellers in England and Wales. The old and very young, disabled or infirm, are the least likely Gypsies and Travellers to be mobile and are thus the most likely to have their homes placed at risk within the planning policy framework, unless they are assimilated into bricks and mortar accommodation that is often culturally anathema.5 Overall then, the identity and status of Gypsies and Travellers in the UK is contradictory in policy and legislation. While Gypsies and Travellers themselves, and the civil society organizations that support them, are confident and proud in their cultures, common histories and differences, the state has failed to provide an overarching protective environment for them. Nor has it appropriately accommodated those communities, who have suffered what has been described as an ‘accommodation crisis’ (Cemlyn et al., 2009) throughout the latter part of the 20th century and into the 21st century.
Multiple research studies and articles have evidenced the marginalized position of Gypsies and Travellers in late modernity (Brearley, 2001; Frazer and Marlier, 2011; Greenfields and Brindley, 2016), including the negation of their ‘cultural nomadism’ (James and Southern, 2019: 324; Kabachnik, 2009). Research has also identified the ways in which Gypsies and Travellers have been criminalized as a consequence of planning policy and practice. Indeed, Ellis and McWhirter (2008: 82) refer to the planning process as the ‘critical interface’ between Gypsies and Travellers and the state. The failure to accommodate Gypsies and Travellers has often resulted in them stopping and staying in places that are deemed illegitimate and public order legislation used to move them on via formal eviction or the threat of such eviction. In association with this criminalizing process, the localism agenda of recent coalition and conservative governments has facilitated settled communities’ negative (and often racist) perceptions of Gypsies and Travellers to inform planning processes and thus prevent site provision. The implications of this are multiple as all Gypsies and Travellers, whether living in bricks and mortar accommodation, legal or illegal sites are vilified and the application of racist tropes are applied to them, no matter their ethnicity. Sibley (1988) uses the work of Douglas (1966) to explain the application of societal notions of ‘purity and danger’ to Gypsies and Travellers, and in doing so he notes how they are stigmatized as ‘a threat to the integrity of the collective’ (Sibley, 1988: 410). Thus, the public consciousness reduces Gypsies and Travellers to a negative, racialized ‘other’.
Within the European policy environment lobbying by civil society organizations led to comprehensive EU-wide level policies for Roma6 inclusion that was intended to guide states towards effective inclusionary policy and practice. However, the capacity of these policies to be impactful on the lived experience of Gypsies and Travellers has been questioned (James and Smith, 2017) and UK implementation of the EU Framework for Roma Inclusion has been ‘exceptionally slow’ (National Federation of Gypsy Liaison Groups et al., 2014: 13). In addition, the United Nations International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination periodic report (2016: 6) found that Gypsies, Travellers and Roma in the UK ‘continue to face exclusion and discrimination’. Further, recent research has identified that Gypsy, Traveller and Roma children in England and Wales experience deprivation in relation to their standard of living, education and/or health (Battaglini et al., 2018; EHRC, 2019).
Increasingly, a ‘hate crime’ agenda has provided policy and legislative vehicles for challenging the ill-treatment of Gypsies and Travellers in the UK. Redress for people victimized on the basis of their identity, and associated reporting mechanisms, have been developed that illuminate the extent of such victimization. Based on and informed by the recommendations made by Macpherson (1999) following an enquiry into the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence, the hate crime agenda has developed similarly to other western jurisdictions, most notably the USA (Hall, 2015). Identifying offences motivated by hostility towards a person’s identity, and associated policy frameworks, has functioned symbolically within states to ‘punish, deter and denounce’ hate behaviours (Mason, 2015). Notwithstanding critiques of the hate crime concept (see Jacobs and Potter (1998) for example), the hate crime agenda has rarely been comprehensive in its capacity to challenge all hate as outlined by Wickes et al. (2016), and specifically hate against Gypsies and Travellers for two specific reasons. First, despite the fact that policy encourages the reporting of hate incidents, as well as crimes, it is highly unlikely that they will be reported to agencies due to their regularity and the resilience this engenders (Williams and Tregidga, 2014) and their minor nature and victims’ perceptions of likelihood for redress (Christmann and Wong, 2010). As Iganski (2008) notes and the research below identifies and discusses, many incidents of hate are petty and banal, akin to the everyday racism previously discussed by Essed (1991). Further, Gypsies and Travellers tend to conflate their experiences of hate incidents with discrimination and thus are unlikely to report to agencies that they perceive as prejudiced towards them, including those set up as third parties (James, 2014). This is despite the policy intention for third party reporting mechanisms to breach the gap between socially excluded communities and support agencies. Gypsy and Traveller support agencies’ anecdotal evidence, as well as the evidence presented in the research below, suggest that Gypsies and Travellers are loath to report hate behaviours (House of Commons, 2019). This is troubling, given the cumulative impact of such events and the likelihood of their seriousness increasing (Bowling, 1999).
Second, the complexity of policy and legislation defining Gypsy and Traveller identities means that they are not necessarily, and/or they do not perceive themselves to be, protected by hate crime policy and legislation. Some Gypsies and Travellers are able to report race hate behaviours, as per their protected ethnic identity (such as Romany Gypsies and Irish Travellers). However, those Gypsies and Travellers not recognized within legislation as a specific ethnic group (such as Show people and New Travellers) are thus not incorporated within the race hate protections, despite their cultural, and often ethnic, similarities. This can result in some Gypsies’ and Travellers’ experiences going unrecorded, subsequently not investigated nor supported by the police and other agencies that the flagging of an incident as hate behaviour would otherwise trigger. While some policing agencies do record hate behaviours beyond the five protected categories in legislation that might provide some additional support for all Gypsies and Travellers in those areas, this is not common (Traveller Movement, 2018).
Critical hate studies
‘Critical hate studies’ (James and McBride, 2018) developed as a response to a call by Perry (2006) for greater critical theorizing in hate studies. Further, the perspective grew out of a specific concern that existing critical theorizing (Perry, 2001) was unable to explain the breadth of hate behaviours in society that were both extreme and ‘everyday’ (Essed, 1991; Iganski, 2008) and have been exacerbated by the failure of agencies to implement joined-up, effective responses to bias-motivated behaviours (Chakraborti, 2018; HMICFRS, 2018). Perry’s (2001) work within hate studies has been seminal and has arguably provided the critical backbone to research in this area (Hall, 2015). Perry (2001) argues that hate behaviours serve to reinforce structural boundaries in society that sustain privilege according to race, gender and sexuality. In her analysis, Perry uses Messerschmidt’s (1997) structured-action approach to explain how human subjectivity is informed by hegemonic norms. Critical hate studies acknowledges the need to provide a critical analysis of hate in late modernity underpinned by a nuanced account of human subjectivity, drawing on ultra-realist theorizing (see Hall and Winlow, 2015) to meet that aim.
The critical hate studies perspective acknowledges that the overriding condition of late modern society is the neoliberal capitalist political economy, as identified by critical theorists (Davies, 2017; Harvey, 2005). Neoliberal capitalism has seen a shift in the logic of social organization, from an environment ordered according to political judgement to one ordered by economic evaluation. Structures of power based on race, gender, class and sexuality have therefore increasingly been co-opted to serve the needs of capital in a society that equates value with fiscal success, rather than political prowess. Neoliberal capitalism encourages and engenders flexibility and adaptability, individualism and competitiveness, while ensuring adherence to market principles in delivery of services, and reduction of costs in provision of welfare. Thus, the neoliberal capitalist political economy embraces the power of the individual within the confines of meeting market needs. This shift in the logic ordering the social world (while more complex and nuanced than I am able to give credit to here), has created an environment within which individual identity characteristics are not core determinants of success or failure in life. The power of elites, and thus the power of white propertied men, has been retained within neoliberalism as wealth, production and ownership has been held in the hands of the few as a consequence of the industrial revolution and the colonial project, and their inherent racism and sexism (Cain and Hopkins, 2001). However, within the competitive individualism of neoliberalism, status provided by race, gender or even class or sexuality does not always assure privilege as it can be subverted by the ‘special liberty’ provided by neoliberal ideology (Hall and Winlow, 2015: 120). Thus, it behoves critical hate studies scholars to consider how and why hate manifests within these conditions. In order to do this, it is necessary to consider the impact of neoliberalism on human subjectivity and consequently how we think about other people within society as hateful subjects.
According to a transcendental materialist model of subjectivity (Johnston, 2008; Žižek, 2006), the self is realized via interaction within the social world and is indeed reliant on that environment for its formation, as per Perry’s (2001) analysis. However, the distinction here is the use of Lacan’s (1977) work in identifying the infinitely malleable nature of the human psyche that requires an ordering mechanism to make sense of the world. Lacan’s approach to the development of subjectivity identifies the human psyche as in search of a symbolic order that can direct and provide capacity for the complex range of emotions and drives that manifest in the neurological system; Lacan therefore suggests that the natural drives and desires of the human subject require channelling. Within a neoliberal environment, that channelling symbolic order is weak as neoliberal capitalism relies on a flexible human condition wherein natural drives and desires are channelled into the market, rather than any sense of collectivity as might manifest in culture and thus create boundaries to capital accumulation (Winlow and Hall, 2016). The human subject then is left wanting, lost within a quagmire of neurological triggers and ontological insecurity (Hall, 2012) that are pacified only by collectivity that is oriented around individualized, competitive identities, rather than notions of community and/or culture (Hall and Winlow, 2015).
Having established that neoliberalism creates the conditions within which we live, and our subjective identity is formed via interaction within the conditions of neoliberalism, we can understand and explain why hate manifests in multiple aspects of social life. Extreme acts of bias-motivated offending are explained as individuals in search of an ordering mechanism in their lives embrace religious dogma, ideological systems based on hierarchical notions of race, gender, sexuality and/or other defined ideologies. Everyday acts of bias-motivated violence are explained as without any effective symbolic order individuals experience a sense of ‘objectless anxiety’ wherein competition and individualism means that ‘everyone is automatically a potential real threat to anyone else’s livelihood, status and identity’ (Hall and Winlow, 2015: 114; see also Hall et al., 2008).
Critical hate studies then provides a theoretical backdrop to understand why hate harms happen as identified here. Furthermore, it goes on to suggest that in order to appreciate the lived experience of hate victimization within neoliberalism it is necessary to use a framework that incorporates all the harms of hate that are subjective, systemic and symbolic (Žižek, 2008). In order to do this critical hate studies utilizes the theory of recognition as developed by Yar (2012) using Honneth (1996) that sets out the necessity for humans to be respected, esteemed and loved in their lives in order to flourish. Although critiques of theories of recognition pose relevant and useful questions (Fraser, 2001; Toniolatti, 2015), the purpose of the theory here is to provide one way of unpacking the harms of hate within neoliberalism that acknowledge the development of human subjectivity. Recognition of the human need to flourish facilitates appreciation of the harms caused by its negation. Critical race theory identifies the symbolic violence of negating human experiences, be that within for example, policy discourse, legislation or historical narrative (Bell, 1980). The critical hate studies perspective argues that negation of recognition occurs throughout society, but is particularly felt within the precariat wherein marginalized people exist at the bottom of social hierarchies (Standing, 2014). As noted above, some Gypsies and Travellers are not ethnic groups; Gypsies’ and Travellers’ lived experience of hate exemplifies the limitations of critical race theory in this regard. To suggest that ethnicity does not determine all Gypsy and Traveller identities does not, in turn, intend to negate the rich, varied and strong ethnic experiences of the majority of Gypsies and Travellers. Indeed, to do so would be to fail to recognize the history of suffering that Gypsies and Travellers have experienced as a result of racism, not least the Pořajmos7 (Huttenbach, 1991). Rather, the point here is to provide an inclusive approach that recognizes all Gypsies’ and Travellers’ experiences of hate in the contemporary era, including, but not limited to, their experiences of racism.
The harms of hate
The theory of recognition (Yar, 2012) provides a useful framework to illustrate the harms of hate. In the first instance, it is necessary to consider the denial of recognition of the need for respect for Gypsies and Travellers. Lobbying by academics, policy makers, civil society and practitioners has meant that, of all the realms of recognition, there has been most recognition of Gypsies’ and Travellers’ needs in this area. As noted above, policy and legislation on both race hate behaviours and racially aggravated offending have recognized many Gypsies and Travellers as victims. Indeed, the acknowledgement of Gypsies and Travellers as marginalized communities has imbued contemporary reports and policy documents as noted above (and see, for example, Cemlyn et al., 2009; Lammy, 2017). The implementation of policies for Gypsy and Traveller inclusion has been slower in materializing, however (James and Smith, 2017), similar to the slow implementation of hate crime legislation generally (Mason, 2015). At the same time, the criminalization of Gypsies and Travellers continues unabated, as evidenced in the failure of local authorities to provide accommodation to Gypsies and Travellers at the same time as the Home Office announcement of proposed new powers for police to ‘crack down on illegal traveller sites’ (sic) (Home Office, 2019). While these new powers are couched within the language of accommodation provision, historically similar intentions have not been realized (Taylor, 2014). Hence, we see in practice the paradox for Gypsies and Travellers in England and Wales, wherein their needs are recognized via multiple policy and legislative mechanisms while also negated within that same arena via criminalization of their cultural nomadism. In addition, as noted above, the complexity of and inherent contradictions within definitions of Gypsy and Traveller identities in policy and legislation means that all Gypsies and Travellers are vulnerable in this context.
It is apparent from the above that two key issues arise. First, there has been a failure by policy makers to appreciate the multiplicity of Gypsy and Traveller cultures and communities in the UK and hence there is a lack of ‘joined up’ thinking regarding provision of statute. Second, essentialized notions of race and mobility have informed those statutes and thus exacerbated those misunderstandings. It has been argued elsewhere that the application of a ‘sedentarist binary’ (James and Southern, 2019: 324) definition of nomadism within contemporary policy has failed to appreciate the cultural nomadism of Gypsies and Travellers, but rather has reduced their cultures8 to their mobility. Gypsies and Travellers are racialized and experience racism in their everyday lives (Clark, 2006). However, to reduce Gypsy and Traveller identities to race and/or ethnicity, not only excludes significant populations, but also serves to augment essentialist perceptions of Gypsies and Travellers as the mythical Romany (Holloway, 2005) that excludes other ethnic groups of Gypsy and Traveller.
Here, it is important to note the way in which neoliberalism ‘has assembled its projects and interests from the field of issues saturated with race, with gender, with sex, with religion, with ethnicity and nationality’ (Duggan, 2012: xvi; see also Brown, 2015). Thus, the racialized mechanisms used to project hate on to Gypsies and Travellers, such as racist speech and language, exclusion from premises and criminalization, reflect those experienced by other minority communities (see Goldberg and Solomos, 2002). Respondents to the hate crime project referred to their experiences of racism in a number of ways: I don’t think they would have taken me to court if I wasn’t a gypsy girl.(Res 2.7)Been called a pikey.(Res 3.9)I am victimised because racism is tolerated.(Res 4.29)Gippo.(Res 2.1)
In addition, references to Gypsies and Travellers as analogous with ‘dirt’ (Sibley, 1988) were also evident in the research: Rubbish thrown at property.(Res 4.6)Called mud people.(Res 1.4)Bars of soap left [outside trailer].(Res 3.2)
Gypsies and Travellers interviewed were pertinently aware of the lack of respect given to them by those in authority. For example, respondents stated: We don’t matter to the authorities.(Res 4.3)When I deal with any kind of office, they reject me/turn me down.(Res 3.7)The government still seem to think its OK to treat me as a 3rd class citizen. . . I think they would love to complete their ‘ethnic cleansing’ plans.(Res 4.7, quotation marks in original)
It was unsurprising therefore, that the Gypsies and Travellers in the research had only reported 28% of the hate crimes they said they had experienced, compared to a national average of 51% for hate crime generally (Flately, 2018). Interestingly, those reports that had been made were to the police, rather than to third parties as might have been expected. The provision of 24 hour, third party reporting centres has served as a central plank of the hate crime agenda in the post-Macpherson era that acknowledged marginalized communities’ lack of confidence in police services (Macpherson, 1999). However, none of the Gypsies and Travellers in this research had reported any incidents or crimes to a third party, potentially suggesting the lack of faith in authorities’ reaches beyond the police for Gypsies and Travellers as evidenced in this research, noted above, by some reticence to complete the hate crime survey. Research has previously shown that Gypsies and Travellers lack trust in authorities generally due to the multi-agency approach used to manage them historically as a problem community (James and Richardson, 2006). This may explain their unwillingness to engage with third party reporting mechanisms. A hate crime reporting mechanism specifically for Gypsies and Travellers has been set up since the completion of this research study that has seen some significant reporting over the last two years (Thompson and Woodger, 2018).
Despite their occasional willingness to report hate incidents and crimes to the police, Gypsies and Travellers generally lacked confidence in the police, similar to other marginalized communities (Phillips and Bowling, 2017). Interactions with police constituted negative encounters as described by the Gypsies and Travellers in the research: Told by a policeman that people like us should be put against a wall and shot as there was no place for people like us in society.(Res 4.5)I suffered post-traumatic stress after an incident where the police raided a site I was living peacefully on. . .. The use of force to innocent people and children was shocking.(Res 3.3)
Overall then, the recognition of Gypsies’ and Travellers’ needs within policy and legislation evidences a positive step forward in delivering respect to those communities. However, a failure to embed a comprehensive appreciation of the variety of Gypsy and Traveller ethnicities and cultures has meant that their experiences overall are not recognized and they thus experience social harms that are systemic as policing authorities practise badly and lack legitimacy for Gypsies and Travellers. The hate crime agenda has a symbolic function to challenge prejudice through legislative means (Mason, 2013), but it fails in this regard by being exclusive in protecting some groups more than others and subsequently augmenting the hierarchy of deserving victims (Chakraborti and Garland, 2012). As such, the current hate crime agenda actually produces a symbolic social harm as Gypsies and Travellers are either placed at the bottom of the hierarchy of provision or are left out of its protective mechanisms.
Mason (2013) argues that hate crime legislation is reliant on victim communities’ capacity to elicit some form of compassion from wider society for its symbolic function to be realized. Given the extensive and historic racism faced by many Gypsies and Travellers, their ability to stimulate concern from the wider social world is highly unlikely in the first instance (Pew Research Center, 2014). Further, the contemporary neoliberal milieu of competitive individualism facilitates detachment, rather than empathy. Gypsies and Travellers then, exist within the precariat, wherein they must fight for access to resources among numerous other socially excluded (and disliked) people who are likewise trying to ascend the ladder of status hierarchy. The competition between Gypsies and Travellers and other minority communities was evident within the hate research project, as one respondent encapsulates here: ‘[There was] a petition in a shop nearby transit site. Racist in my view but, apparently not in the eyes of the police. I’m sure if it had been against Black/Asian minorities action would have been taken’ (Res 2.3).
In addition, competition between Gypsy and Traveller communities has previously been noted in research (Bhopal and Myers, 2008), with specific references to the problematization of New Travellers as illegitimate, despite having lived culturally nomadic lifestyles for generations (Clark, 1997). Beyond this, other Gypsies and Travellers have also competed for status within the hierarchies of provision and legitimacy. Greenfields (2006: 55) says, when there is significant pressure over sites, land usage and the level of discrimination and bad publicity that Travellers commonly experience, it is human nature that individuals will have a tendency to express the opinion that ‘it’s not Travellers like X, its Travellers of Y ethnicity who behave in this manner’. Accordingly a perceived hierarchy of ‘acceptable Travelling communities’ may be said to exist in the minds of the media, the public and, to some extent, of Gypsies and Travellers themselves.
The ‘human nature’ Greenfields refers to here, I would argue, relates to the subjective identity developed within the competitive and individualized norms of neoliberal capitalism. Indeed, the lack of site provision for Gypsies and Travellers, augmented by the closure of their traditional stopping places since the 1960s (Taylor, 2014), has meant that competition for spaces to stop and stay on has proliferated and been amplified by the cultural nomadism of New Travellers. Subsequent stigmatization of Gypsies and Travellers, alongside existing racism, has manifested within media and public perceptions, as well as within Gypsy and Traveller cultures themselves. Within this research, some Gypsies and Travellers referred to internal tensions between cultures: The problems I have had is from people on site. Prejudice from people on site.(Res 4.1)They want me off the site.(Res 2.42)
The lack of solidarity between people and communities that status hierarchies create (as noted by Hall et al., 1978), results in a failure of recognition of the human need for esteem. With no effective symbolic order for humans to acknowledge each other within, that is respectful of their similarities and differences, the capacity for human flourishing is diminished. This research evidenced the low esteem that Gypsies and Travellers are held in by wider society. The 79 people who completed the survey reported a total of 225 hate incidents or crimes committed against them on the basis of their identity as a Gypsy or Traveller. Bias-motivated incidents they experienced included hate speech through name calling (81% of respondents), general bullying (71% of respondents) and serious threats and intimidation (29% of respondents), including sexualized intimidation, harassment and unwanted photography and filming. Bias-motivated crimes they experienced included minor damage to property (30% of respondents), serious damage to property (20% of respondents), minor physical assault (20% of respondents) and serious physical assault (15% of respondents). Other offences experienced were, burglary, theft, stone throwing, brick throwing, being shot at and arson (overall 19% of respondents).
One interview from the research reveals Gypsies’ and Travellers’ lived experience of fear and insecurity, the difficulty to find a space to stop and stay on and their inability to rely on others for help or support: In the past Sandra* has experienced extensive bullying and abuse due to being a Traveller. She has been banned from launderettes, pubs and shops and her living vehicles have been subject to criminal damage. Most recently, she was invited to occupy a particular place by a landowner, which appeared an opportunity to provide space for herself and other Travellers to settle for a period. She had not been to the locality before and there were no available legitimate stopping sites in the vicinity. She felt that this invitation to occupy farmland equated to a safe place to stop. One afternoon, not long after their arrival, around 30 local farmers, armed with shotguns, turned up at the site telling the Travellers to move on and threatening that if they had not left by the end of the day, they would return at night. Given that the Travellers felt they had been given the right to stay on the land by the landowner, that it was a group of four families with a total of nine young children aged 5 to 9, and they were unfamiliar with anywhere else to go, the Travellers stayed on the site. The threat of the farmers returning meant that the Travellers were fearful for their children. These fears were made worse by their previous negative experiences of ill-treatment by gorgers (non-Gypsies). The Travellers were so fearful that they arranged escape routes from the site and hiding places for the children in case the farmers should return. This involved placing sheepskin rugs over barbed wire fences and placing duvets, torches and food in secluded hiding spots nearby.(Int notes S, *pseudonym)
In this circumstance, it transpired that the landowner had an ulterior motive for the Travellers’ occupation of his land, as he was using their presence to place pressure on the local authority to agree a previously refused planning application for a building on his land. Not only then are Gypsies and Travellers perceived as problematic within communities, they are also in this instance considered to serve a purpose as a consequence of the lack of esteem held for them by sedentary communities and authorities alike. Suggestions that this simply represents a clash between nomadism and sedentarism (Levinson and Sparkes, 2004) would be to reduce appreciations of nomadism to mobility, and would negate the fact that mobility has been largely embraced in contemporary society, when it has served the interests of profit (James and Channing, 2019). Indeed, the caravanning industry, that serves the seasonal use of caravans and parks for people to holiday, has burgeoned in the late 20th century and caravan sites for holidaymakers cover the countryside where this research was completed.
The extensive subjective, systemic and symbolic harms detailed above place Gypsies and Travellers in fear of their and their families’ safety. The insecurity of everyday life in contemporary neoliberal society manifests acutely within, and is exacerbated by, the precarity of Gypsies’ and Travellers’ lived experience. Within such circumstances it is unsurprising that Gypsies and Travellers commonly hide their identity from those in authority and others outside of their community (James, 2007). In doing so, however, they risk further harms to themselves and the primary interpersonal relationships they have. Recognition of the human need for love is essential for human beings to thrive and thus its negation is highly problematic. Within the hate research project, a number of parents noted the trouble caused to their children when they identified them as from Gypsy and Traveller homes: School said they had a vacancy for our youngest daughter until I said where we lived and was then told they made a mistake and didn’t have any vacancies.(Res 2.8)I did take my daughter out of Year 7 because of bullying related to her living in vehicles.(Res 3.7)
The failure to recognize a loved one’s identity is to negate their cultural inheritance and their sense of self, causing harm to them as they develop their subjectivity in relation to those that care for them most. This symbolic harm is augmented by wider society’s exclusion of Gypsies and Travellers and essentialism of their cultures, as noted above. Powell (2008) suggests that Gypsies and Travellers utilize their limited agency through tactically circumventing social controls placed on them. Indeed, within this research, some participants evidenced their resilience to hateful behaviours through averting their impact: [I don’t report] because I don’t identify as a victim.(Res 4.53)[Victimization is] just general assumptions based on stereotypes, easily turned around via the provision of info in response to ignorance, always a positive game changer .(Res 5.6)
This is not to suggest that Gypsies and Travellers are not subject to social forces, but rather that they retain their cultural integrity through tactics of aversion that have resulted in resilience, similar to participants in research by Williams and Tregidga (2014). This means that Gypsies and Travellers live separately from wider society of their own volition, as well as as a consequence of their exclusion. While their laudable attempts to resist the oppression of others means that they can occasionally exist beyond the reach of control agencies, this also means that they can exist beyond the reach of other, supportive agencies. Further, it results in the amplification of the cultural essentialism imposed upon them. This means that effective resolution of domestic and community problems is not facilitated, as Gypsies and Travellers lack confidence to report such matters and support agencies are fearful to broach them. Apart from progressive work carried out by civil society organizations, there is barely any research on domestic violence, homophobia, transphobia or inter-community anti-Gypsyism within Gypsy and Traveller communities. Given the rates of such issues in wider society, it behoves us to consider how to breach this gap to ensure that Gypsies and Travellers attain recognition of their need for love.
Conclusion
This article has identified the breadth of hate harms Gypsies and Travellers experience within contemporary neoliberal capitalism. By using a critical hate studies approach, it has been possible to provide an inclusive analysis that recognizes the lived experience of hate for all Gypsies and Travellers. The article has therefore set out how critically informed scholarship on hate can inform knowledge in two ways. First, it can facilitate criminology to move beyond existing debates in studies of race and ethnicity via the inclusion of Gypsies and Travellers within discussion where they have previously been negated (see, for example, Spalek, 2008). Second, it enables criminological engagement with the wider social sciences, specifically psychology and sociology, to examine the impact of neoliberal capitalism on human relations generally, while ensuring acknowledgement of the nuanced experiences of minority communities. Notwithstanding existing research on microaggressions (see, for example, Hughey et al., 2017; Sue, 2010), a key area of concern within hate studies has been the apparent inability of critical theory to explain the everyday nature of hate, as well as extreme hate behaviours committed against multiple communities. Scholarship in this area has vacillated around the concept of hate itself, whom to protect within policy and legislation, and how to challenge increased levels of hatefulness in contemporary society. This article proposes a rehabilitation of the notion of hate through the lens of social harm. It has been evidenced here that Gypsies and Travellers experience hostility towards them on the basis of their identity and thus, the necessity to examine and theorize hate is important and relevant, as is the development and implementation of statute to challenge hateful behaviours. Indeed, some protections against race hate are in place, however existing protective frameworks simply serve as silos that can be breached but commonly are not, due to a lack of solidarity between and within marginalized communities and wider society. While the capacity of this article does not allow a full consideration of policy development, and further research is required, it is worth noting the need for more than piecemeal policy and legislative changes that only have the capacity to address specific hateful behaviours (Brown, 2015). A critical hate studies perspective suggests that hate studies could expedite a comprehensive and effective approach to positive praxis through recognition of the human need to flourish. In doing so, a positive discourse would develop that focused on what should, rather than should not, be experienced (Hall and Winlow, 2015). It would then be possible to create a policy and practice environment that effectively acknowledges that race matters, but which also acknowledges the intersectional nature of our identities and the harmful subjectivities engendered within contemporary neoliberal society.

In collaboration with the journalism company Clear Health Costs. There is a recent study that found nearly one in eight people with commercial insurance who had a screening colonoscopy were hit with hundreds or even thousands of dollars in unexpected charges. Now there is new legislation signed by President Trump that may resolve the problem for Medicare patients, but a lot of our viewers with private health insurance tell us they`ve been stuck with such bills and simply cannot understand why. Consumer investigative correspondent Anna Werner has been digging into this. Anna, this is so interesting. Good morning.
ANNA WERNER (CBS THIS MORNING Consumer Investigative Correspondent): Good morning, David. You know, everyone over fifty should get a baseline screening colonoscopy. And federal guidelines say insurance company should pay for it. So, why do we keep hearing from viewers who say they got stuck with the bill?
(Begin VT)
ANNA WERNER: Tammy Garrisi-Duncan turned fifty in January. And along with her birthday came an order from her doctor for her first screening colonoscopy. Recommended for everyone turning fifty and supposed to be given at no cost to patients once every ten years under the Affordable Care Act. She called her insurance company to confirm they`d pay.
And what response back did you get from Blue Cross Blue Shield?
TAMMY GARRISI-DUNCAN (Patient): The procedure was a hundred percent covered as a screening. The facility was a hundred percent covered and the doctor was a hundred percent covered, all within network.
ANNA WERNER: At the clinic she says a staff member asked if any family members had had colonoscopies, which they had.
TAMMY GARRISI-DUNCAN: I said, well, my mom had a few polyps back years ago, my dad had a few polyps.
ANNA WERNER: After the test, she says, the doctor told her everything looked good.
TAMMY GARRISI-DUNCAN: And that was it. And-- and when I went home, everything was well. And then I started getting the bills.
ANNA WERNER: And those bills for a colonoscopy that was supposed to be covered, some six hundred twenty-five dollars for the facility, over three hundred for the doctor`s services and another three hundred twenty-five dollars for the anesthesiologist. In total, over twelve hundred dollars her insurance company refused to pay. The reason? She says the clinic had decided that because of her parents` polyps, she was now a high-risk patient. So then her insurance company said it was no longer a free screening colonoscopy, but a diagnostic colonoscopy she`d have to pay for.
TAMMY GARRISI-DUNCAN: I said, am I on candid camera somewhere? I don`t understand this at all. It seems utterly ridiculous. And I just wonder how many people this is happening to, which is why I contacted CBS when I heard about, you know, kind of the unveiling of this type of problem.
ANNA WERNER: She is not the only one who`s contacted us. We`ve had dozens of complaints from people who say their free screening colonoscopies turned into large unexpected bills, particularly if they had precancerous polyps removed, an integral part of those screenings.
REPRESENTATIVE DONALD PAYNE JUNIOR: Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in America.
ANNA WERNER: New Jersey Democratic Congressman Donald Payne Junior has been trying to fix those billing issues. His father, long-time Congressman Donald Payne Senior, died of colon cancer in 2012.
REPRESENTATIVE DONALD PAYNE JUNIOR: Unfortunately, my father would not get checked and subsequently succumbed to the disease. And there`s no reason that he shouldn`t-- he shouldn`t be here now other than he wasn`t screened.
ANNA WERNER: Payne sponsored legislation to close the billing loophole for Medicare patients so that if polyps are removed, that part of the colonoscopy will also be paid for.
REPRESENTATIVE DONALD PAYNE JUNIOR: People should not have to be worried if and when they go to sleep before a procedure what the bill is going to be on the other side.
ANNA WERNER: His bill passed Congress last week, but it doesn`t apply to private insurance patients, many of whom told us they still received bills for colonoscopies they thought were covered. That`s despite the fact the Department of Health and Human Services says screening colonoscopies should be covered for private insurance patients, even if polyps are removed.
Is this the way you wanted it to work?
DR. MARK FENDRICK (University of Michigan Medicine and Public Health Professor): No. That patient who goes into an office to get a screening colonoscopy should not have to pay anything when they wake up.
ANNA WERNER: Doctor Mark Fendrick is a professor of medicine and public health at the University of Michigan, who helped write that section of the ACA.
DR. MARK FENDRICK: The fact that you`re still getting your viewers sending in these complaints suggest we have not implemented what I believe is the spirit of the regulation.
ANNA WERNER: Doctor Fendrick says the ultimate goal should be for the entire screening process to be covered for everyone. But in the meantime, Garrisi-Duncan still owes over twelve hundred dollars, a debt she says she has no plans to pay.
TAMMY GARRISI-DUNCAN: I have already instructed my family members if I were to die unfortunately in some tragic accident, do not pay this bill.
(End VT)
ANNA WERNER: Well, she has an appeal pending with her insurance company, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois. The company would not comment on her individual case, but told us that doctors are the ones who code the colonoscopies as either a routine free screening or a diagnostic colonoscopy. If it`s a routine screening, they said that they are free to members if they are in network. Now if you have private insurance and you had problems with this or any other medical pricing problem out there, we`d like to hear from you. You can e-mail me at healthcosts@cbsnews.com Jericka.
JERICKA DUNCAN: Anna, thank you so much.
Ahead, Jamie Yuccas will bring us What to Watch.
But first, it`s seven forty-three, it`s time to check your local weather.
(LOCAL WEATHER BREAK)
(ANNOUNCEMENTS)
JERICKA DUNCAN: Time now for What to Watch with Jamie Yuccas who is filling in for Vlad Duthiers. But no worries, she`s got your play-by-play of the top stories today. You like that, Jamie?
JAMIE YUCCAS: It`s like a little rhyme.
JERICKA DUNCAN: And I love your outfit, you look stunning.
JAMIE YUCCAS: Thank you. I-- you all look fabulous this morning. Should we just keep complimenting each other?
DAVID BEGNAUD: Hey, why not?
ADRIANA DIAZ: No, you are.
JAMIE YUCCAS: Well, I hope you`re all having a good morning. We do have an update on a story we told you about yesterday that we want to get to. Police have identified the woman in a viral video accusing a black teenager of stealing her cell phone at a Manhattan hotel.
WOMAN (Keyon Harrold; internet video): Take the case off, that`s mine. Literally, get it back please.
KEYON HARROLD SENIOR (internet video): Are you kidding me? You feel like there`s only one-- one iPhone made in the world?
WOMAN (Keyon Harrold; internet video): No. Okay. Then show me this. Show me--
KEYON HARROLD SENIOR (internet video): No. Get-- get a life.
JAMIE YUCCAS: Police have not released the woman`s name. They are investigating, but not as a bias incident. The teenager`s father, Keyon Harrold, took this video of the incident in a New York City hotel lobby. Harrold, who`s a Grammy Award-winning musician, said the woman tackled his son demanding to see his phone. Officials say she actually left the phone in an Uber car and the driver returned it just a short time later on the same day.
DAVID BEGNAUD: Wow.
JAMIE YUCCAS: New York Mayor Bill de Blasio called the incident racism, pure and simple. And what struck me about this one is that the father and son had come down from their room to go to breakfast. This woman had checked out of the hotel a couple days prior. And the hotel manager steps in and tries to rectify the situation, and it looks like in the video is asking to see the cell phone from the son, the guests of the hotel.
JERICKA DUNCAN: I see there`s-- there`s also even a press conference, Jamie, later today where they are calling for charges of assault and battery, the family. And so far, they started a petition. They are looking for a hundred thousand people to sign on. And so far, over fifty-eight thousand. So, a lot of people are-- are not happy with this story.
ADRIANA DIAZ: You know what I love about the father? He wants people to make sure that there`s proof before trying to identify the woman themselves. And on Instagram he also said, you know, let`s not jump to conclusions, everyone is innocent until proven guilty. Still, trying to make sure that, you know, that-- that-- that right is protected.
DAVID BEGNAUD: I don`t understand what--
JAMIE YUCCAS: Still-- still a tough situation--
ADRIANA DIAZ: Yeah.
JAMIE YUCCAS: --for the fourteen-year-old boy, though.
JERICKA DUNCAN: Oh, yeah.
JAMIE YUCCAS: Come on.
DAVID BEGNAUD: I don`t understand what he did to make the lady think you stole it.
JERICKA DUNCAN: Right.
DAVID BEGNAUD: Like, how did that even come about? Maybe you lost-- I-- I don`t know how that`s the first thing she meant to--
JERICKA DUNCAN: Well, I`m sure it`s only a matter of time before--
DAVID BEGNAUD: Yeah.
JERICKA DUNCAN: --we actually know.
JAMIE YUCCAS: Good question, David.
JERICKA DUNCAN: To hear from her.
JAMIE YUCCAS: Well, onto this next one, a park ranger in New Mexico was caught on video repeatedly using a Taser on a Native American man who the ranger said had left a hiking trail on protected parkland. We want to warn you, this video is disturbing.
WOMAN (Instagram/Chief House; internet video): Excuse me, what are you doing? Stop.
JAMIE YUCCAS: The ranger keeps telling Native American Darrell House to put his hands behind his back. House refuses saying he did nothing wrong and only went off trail to keep his distance from another group of hikers. When another ranger arrived, House is placed in handcuffs and is told he is being detained for failing to identify himself. The National Park Service released a statement saying it will conduct a thorough investigation and will review the officer`s bodycam footage and this social media video that has gone viral. I can tell you the park service is releasing some of the lapel video. The ranger does ask for his identification numerous times. But as you can see, he`s tased a second time while he`s already on the ground.
DAVID BEGNAUD: So what`s interesting here, I watched all four minutes of the video, right? Yes, he`s told to sit on the ground, he doesn`t do it, he doesn`t identify himself. But, Jamie, that`s a use of force against a man who simply is not listening to you. But he never advances toward the officer, he never advances on anyone else, he`s in the middle of the desert. I mean, he shows his hands the entire times, but-- but yet this force is used on him by the Taser. And I asked the park service, was he right to use force? And they said we`re looking into it.
JAMIE YUCCAS: Yep. Investigating, of course.
Okay, you`ve seen these robots help doctors and remind folks to social distance in public parks. We could do a little bit of the robot--
DAVID BEGNAUD: A smile.
JAMIE YUCCAS: --maybe.
ADRIANA DIAZ: Yeah.
JAMIE YUCCAS: They are better dancers, take a look.
(Robots performing; Boston Dynamics)
JAMIE YUCCAS: ""Watch me now."" They are getting-- there they are getting down to ""Do You Love Me"" by The Contours. The robots maker Boston Dynamics released this video to ring in the New Year. It features their two signature machines Atlas and Spot. If you want to buy Spot, it`s seventy- five thousand dollars.
JERICKA DUNCAN: All right, Jamie.
We`ll be right back with Senator Chris Coons.

*************************************************************************** ** (8:00 AM, EDT)
ADRIANA DIAZ: It`s Wednesday, December 30, 2020. Welcome back to CBS THIS MORNING. I am Adriana Diaz with Jericka Duncan and David Begnaud.
A threatening new coronavirus strain is found in the U.S. for the first time. Plus, we`ll ask Democratic Senator Chris Coons about a stalled plan to increase COVID relief payments.
DAVID BEGNAUD: The newest threat in this pandemic could be New Year`s Eve, how private parties may become superspreader events.
JERICKA DUNCAN: And looking forward to travel in 2021. Americans are itching to go somewhere. We`ll look at when it might be safe.
But first, here`s today`s Eye Opener @ 8.
CHARLIE D`AGATA: It has been hailed as a vaccine that will transform the fight against COVID, a global game-changer.
MEG OLIVER: Here in the one-time epicenter of the outbreak, hospitalizations have more than doubled since the beginning of the month, as Doctor Anthony Fauci warns the pandemic is out of control.
DAVID BEGNAUD: President-elect Joe Biden blames the Trump administration for the slow pace of vaccinating Americans. And yesterday, Mister Biden made a promise--vaccinate one hundred million Americans in the first one hundred days of his term.
LARRY HOGAN: There`s a lot of moving parts. And I think nobody is quite performing at the top capacity and we`ve all got to work together to ramp it up.
JERICKA DUNCAN: Louisville is close to firing two police detectives for their roles in the Breonna Taylor case. Detective Joshua Jaynes obtained the search warrant. Detective Myles Cosgrove fired the shot.
MAN #1: Through the (INDISTINCT), Johnson stays up.
MAN #2: Oh, my--
MAN #1: That is absolutely insane.
MAN #3: Colorado facing Texas in the Alamo Bowl. This one was all Texas.
MAN #4: Getting off, it`s great.
MAN #1: Oh, no, he did not.
MAN #5: Caught Johnson.
MAN #6: Have you ever seen a three-hundred-pound man fly like that?
MAN #7: Texas beat up on Colorado 55-23.
MAN #8: Here we go.
MAN #9: Oh, yes. Oh, they got him really good.
ADRIANA DIAZ: They got him good. Welcome back, everyone. Gayle, Tony and Anthony are off this morning.
British regulators have given the go-ahead to another new coronavirus vaccine. Officials say the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot could be given to patients there starting next week. U.S. approval is still pending. Meanwhile, a Colorado man in his twenties with no travel history in Britain has been identified as the first American with the newly identified strain of COVID first seen in the U.K. British officials think this variant of the virus spreads much more easily. That patient is in isolation.
JERICKA DUNCAN: The effort to increase COVID relief payments from six hundred dollars to two thousand dollars is on hold this morning. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell turned away two attempts to vote on it yesterday. He and other Republicans say the increase requested by the President is too costly. Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware joins us now. He`s a close friend and advisor to President-elect Biden. Senator, good morning.
SENATOR CHRIS COONS (D-Delaware): Good morning. Great to be on with you.
JERICKA DUNCAN: Yeah, I want to start with the stimulus bill. As you know, the House supported this, two seventy-five to one thirty-four. It had bipartisan support. We know that you`re known for reaching across the aisle and have good relationships with your Republican colleagues. What are they thinking right now? And is this likely to pass the Senate?
SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Frankly, for the last six months Democrats have tried to deliver broader, stronger relief to the American people as the pandemic has gotten worse and worse. And the votes that we`re going to see this week in Congress are just a repeat of that pattern. The-- the House Democrats led by Speaker Pelosi quickly took up and passed an additional bill that would raise the stimulus payments from six hundred per person to two thousand. That was shot down by the Senate Republican majority leader last night. I suspect we`ll be fighting over this for the rest of the week. We are now just three weeks from Joe Biden`s inauguration as the next President of the United States. That will give us a chance to reset and to show that we can work together again and deliver the relief the American people need. The results of the election in Georgia where there are two Senate seats at stake next week may well determine whether we can deliver more relief to the American people next year.
DAVID BEGNAUD: Senator, good morning. It`s David Begnaud. Let me press you on that if I may. So if Republican senators won`t do it with a Republican President saying he wants it, how is Joe Biden--
SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Right.
DAVID BEGNAUD: --a Democrat, going to make that happen when he comes into office. I mean, I get that he`ll try and work across the aisle, he`s work with McConnell in the past, but how is this actually going to happen with him as president?
SENATOR CHRIS COONS: David, it`s going to be very difficult. Frankly, President Trump has been absent for weeks. Ever since losing the election, he`s mostly been spending his time golfing and tweeting and indulging himself in conspiracy theories about how he actually won the election. President-elect Joe Biden is already preparing to put on the floor of the House and the Senate to move forward together with Congress a package of urgently needed relief. We are in the very worst phase of this public health crisis, this pandemic which has taken more than three hundred thousand American lives. I am hoping and praying that Republicans once we get to the New Year will recognize we have to deliver more relief to the American people. But I`m clear-eyed and so is Joe Biden. This will be very difficult.
JERICKA DUNCAN: And, Senator Coons, to that point about the pandemic, you have twenty million Americans that were supposed to get this first dose of the COVID vaccine and we`re only even half at that point, about two million. And then just last week, COVID became the leading cause of death in this country. What`s happening behind the scenes? And are you satisfied with this rollout?
SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Absolutely not. Jericka, look, first, to celebrate the news that you just shared, the AstraZeneca vaccine has been approved in the United Kingdom. We do have vaccines that will be effective and safe and we need a massive campaign to get Americans access to this vaccine. But frankly, if you look at Joe Biden`s agenda for the first hundred days that he`s President, it includes making sure that we get the basics done, that we`ve never done under President Trump`s failed leadership. We don`t have PPE for every single front-line essential health care worker. We don`t have tests for COVID-19 that are rapid and effective available to every American. So, a lot of the work we still have to do is to get personal protective equipment and testing and vaccines out to the American people in the middle of a pandemic that`s gotten worse than ever. We have a lot of work ahead of us a key piece of that is strengthening the ability of our strained and tired public health infrastructure across the country to deliver vaccines to the American people.
DAVID BEGNAUD: Senator, I`ve got forty-five seconds left. Let me try this if I can. Do you know who Joe Biden will name attorney general?
SENATOR CHRIS COONS: No, I don`t. I am hoping that he will choose my colleague, Doug Jones. But there are a number of very capable and talented folks he is seriously considering. He has assembled an amazing team for his cabinet. A team that is experienced, that is ready to work together on day one and that reflects the diverse nature of our country. He`s put together a great Cabinet.
JERICKA DUNCAN: All right. Senator Chris Coons out of Delaware for us. Thank you so much for your time.
SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Thank you.
JERICKA DUNCAN: Ahead, New Year`s Eve revelers will not be allowed in iconic locations like Times Square to ring in 2021. We`ll show you why health experts worry celebrations elsewhere could make the pandemic even worse.
But first, it`s eight-oh-seven, time to check your local weather.

And when November's election now less than four months away. President Trump doubling down, using race to appeal to his base, especially when it comes to the confederate flag, will it work? We are going to talk about it in the hour ahead. Joining me now is CNN's White House correspondent John Harwood. John good evening to you, thank you so much. Coronavirus, the cases are really spiking all over the U.S. but that is not why the president is changing his mind on masks and task force briefings, give me the real reason.
JOHN HARWOOD, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, we know the real reason, it's because we have had two polls in the last five days or so, that show him down 15 points to Joe Biden. When you are an incumbent president seeking re-election, and you are getting hammered that badly, the only thing you can do is change course.
He fired his campaign manager a few days ago and now he is reinstituting the coronavirus briefings. And he tweeted out a picture of himself wearing a mask, and sort of, kind of, embraced mask wearing as something that patriotic Americans should do.
He put it in the mouths of other people, and many people say that is what you should do. But, I think you have to look at both of those developments and say, whatever the motivation, and Donald Trump's motivation is always what is good for Donald Trump, as opposed to other people, these are positive steps forward for the effort to contain the coronavirus to the extent that some people in the country will take their cues from President Trump and react accordingly. That is something that every American can be grateful for.
LEMON: OK, so, he, you know, you heard him earlier saying, it's a great time slot, and you know, the ratings are through the roof and so on. Can we --
HARWOOD: Right.
LEMON: You know, can we actually -- can we expect to actually hear from medical experts at this briefing tomorrow or will it be more lying and sugar coating from the president, and it this will be just about Donald Trump and re-election?
HARWOOD: Well, I think it will be both. I think, Donald Trump as he indicated, enjoys the showmanship, enjoys the time slot, enjoys the eyeballs looking at him. He may imagine that it's good for re- election, but of course, we know, that his performance since usually if he talks for an extended period in front of a camera, and gets serious questions, the results don't make him look very good as we saw with Chris Wallace over the weekend.
And so, those briefings actually hurt his re-election chances and that's why they stopped doing it. Nevertheless, they are going to start doing them and I think that because they are starting, and because there's so much pressure from states around the country, including some Republican politicians who has typically supported the president, I think there's going to be some expert testimony and expert discussion, Deborah Birx, Tony Fauci, Robert Redfield, people like that, I don't know which of those individually will speak, but I do think they can't afford to start this and just have President Trump get up there and deliver the nonsense about testing and cases being harmless and all that that he has been doing for several weeks.
LEMON: Yes, the sniffles, you know, let me ask you, you brought up the Chris Wallace interviews, I don't know if you are hearing anything -- are you hearing anything from the White House, or do they actually think that was a good look for the president, because -- not so much.
HARWOOD: Nobody thinks that was a good look for the president. He -- his answers were often incoherent. He didn't always track the questions. He would, Chris would ask him a question and he would repeat something back and say, well, you said this. Well, that's not what Chris said actually.
[23:05:10]
And calling on aids to provide information to refute Chris when there actually was no information to refute Chris, it was, it, may have been somebody's idea of how you turn the president around, put him out there on Fox News with their most, one of the most capable interviewers, but the results were not pretty for the president.
LEMON: No, not at all. And Chris did a great job on that, I have to say.
Also, tonight, the president said that he will, he will send federal law enforcement to cities run by liberal Democrats. He claims this is about law and order, but David Axelrod, who I talked to in just in the last hour, he thinks this is a 2020 version of his caravan, or his wall. What do you think?
HARWOOD: I think David's exactly right. The president is clearly in the case of Portland, escalating rather than deescalating the situation. This president imagines that he can recreate the silent majority of 50 years ago, in the same way that Richard Nixon and conservatives did at that time. Appeals to racism, among whites, and imagining the forceful put downs of protests, billy clubs and tear gas are going to galvanize, galvanize the silent majority.
That is not the America we live in anymore. We ran that experiment just out front of the White House some weeks ago when the president set federal troops or federal officers to rough up peaceful protesters and move them out so the president could walk and wave a bible in front of the church.
That was a signal event in his political decline. That was, that was an event that damaged the president. Nevertheless, he has a fantasy in his mind that this kind of old school political formula, is going to work for him. And there's no evidence in the polling to suggest that it will.
LEMON: It's this, John, I'm so glad that you bringing up the caravan, remember that whole thing that the hoard, the caravans are coming to get you and then -- that was a promise in 2016 or whatever, that was the tactics in 2016 and then the wall -- hardly any of the wall has been built, it's just been dilapidated wall that they are replacing. But I'm glad you reminded our viewers of the caravan and the wall -- thank you -- that Mexico was supposed to pay for by the way. Thank you, John, I appreciate it. I'll see you soon.
HARWOOD: Exactly.
LEMON: I want to bring in now, Andy Slavitt, he is the former acting administrator at the Centers for Medicate and Medicaid Services. Andy, good evening to you. Some Republicans are pushing back on the White House proposal to cut out funding for coronavirus testing and tracing. Why would anyone support this plan?
ANDY SLAVITT, FORMER ACTING HEAD OF THE HEALTH CARE FOR THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, HOST, IN THE BUBBLE: Well, it's crazy. I think, you know, just to keep recap on what is going on. There's, we are now testing a -- only fraction, the CDC estimates maybe about 10 percent of the people that have cases. That means that it is growing by asymptomatic spreaders all over the country. And until that's under control, we cannot stop anything. So, the Congress is proposing and the House passed the bill asking that we pass pressures to give us more testing capability, the ability to do contact testing and the president has said that he doesn't want any money for that. I think he thinks it is going to make him look bad and I think he feels that he wants America to turn another direction. I'm not sure which direction would be that will go away. And Republican governors -- Democratic Governors are sitting with the problem in their hands, saying that is going to lead to more death.
LEMON: Yes. We are learning that test results are lagging by up to two weeks in some cases, Andy. How is testing still a problem this many months in to this pandemic?
SLAVITT: Well, the original sin in this case, not to take a phrase that belongs somewhere else of course is, that you have a White House who decided to not accept responsibility. And the White House essentially said from the beginning, that it was the states that were going to have to take care of testing and that is because the president or the White House knew they were going to run out of supplies, the whole swabs and reagents.
So, here we sit in July with the exact same problem we had in March. Which is we don't have enough PPE for people in hospitals and we don't have the ability to test because they have not taken accountability. And so this is just going to mean we are going to have less visibility, we are going to lose more people, if things are going to spread out of control and of course, the economy won't be able to kickback up again.
LEMON: And it didn't have to be this way.
The president tweeting about masks. That's encouraging, but you say, you know, so much for, so much more, I should say, is needed than just tweeting about a mask and that he wore it at a hospital, by the way, which was, we are told, that they created you know, a space for him to have to wear this mask.
[23:10:15]
SLAVITT: It's been in negotiation with his staff. I talked to the staffer today that persuaded him to make that tweet. And my comment to him was, you got one day in a row. And he laughed. Because the truth is, that you know, you can kind of out of bad moment or a good moment persuade the president to do something that is against his judgment because he thinks it's good for him or because you convince him.
And he does it in kind of a way that sort of demeans it as he does it by saying some people say. And then see the next day, he will run the other direction. I think that's exactly what happened when they put out a plan on how to reopen the country and of course the very next day, the president tweeted, liberate Michigan, liberate Minnesota, and essentially winking at everybody.
LEMON: Yes. So, let's talk about this early results from the Oxford vaccine. It shows both safe and induced as an immune response. Induce immune response. Reduce I should say immune response. What does it mean for the race to find a coronavirus vaccine?
SLAVITT: Well, I talked to a number of the people who have seen the data, both that data and the Moderna data and indeed, you know, creating a response is what you want to see. Now, what we don't know, is that how long will that response last? And we don't know if that response will reduce the severity of coronavirus or eliminate it entirely.
Nevertheless, its good news and I think we should treat it as part of a coming arsenal of things. Including convalescent plasma, including vaccines that will be here, I think in the U.S. probably sometime in 2021. But certainly our scientists are to be applauded for the job that they've done already.
And so, you know, it's going to be two steps forward, one step back. I think we should make sure to get too excited every time we see good data, but I think we are going to get there.
LEMON: Yes. I should say, I want to make sure that it's clear, that it's safe and induced an immune response. You understood what I was saying, right?
SLAVITT: I did.
LEMON: Thank you, Andy, I appreciate it, thank you so much. Now, I want to go to Nick Watt with the latest on the dire situation in Florida.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A better option, because --
NICK WATT, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: In Florida -- the Governor was heckled today. Florida's average death toll doubled these past two weeks. Monete Hicks lost two of her children to COVID-19. Brian Francis and McKayla, in the space of 11 days.
MONETE HICKS, LOST SON AND DAUGHTER TO CORONAVIRUS: I honestly can't say where they got this virus from because they basically was home bound. I mean the only thing we went to Orlando for a vacation. And all of a sudden, they came home sick. Wear your mask. If you don't have to come out. Stay home.
WATT: But the Governor still won't mandate masks. So in Miami, the city will find those with uncovered faces.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's bizarre that we have turned mask wearing in to something political. Imagine you were an alien coming to the planet earth. You would be totally astounded, puzzled and amazed, you wonder what is going on here.
WATT: Nationally we are now seeing three times the number of new cases every day compared to mid-June, and nearly 60,000 Americans are right now, hospitalized with COVID-19. Getting close to the grim record set back in April. ADM. BRETT GIROIR, HHS ASSISTANT SECRETARY: There's no question that we are having a surge right now, it really is all hands on deck. This is serious. But we know how to stop this.
WATT: And in this graph, there might be some optimism, average new case counts are flattening just a little in our hot spots, California, Arizona, Florida, and Texas. Let's hope that holds a possible reason?
DR. ALISON HADDOCK, EMERGENCY ROOM PHYSICIAN, PUBLIC HEALTH DISASTER: Since the mask order went in to place, I have seen more people in my community who are wearing masks, who are doing more social distancing. I think some of this individual behavior changes are driving some of the improvement that we are seeing.
WATT: As New York City moves in to phase four opening today, Governor Andrew Cuomo has a message aimed at young party goers.
GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): I'm telling you in plain New York speak, as a born and bred New Yorker, it's stupid what you are doing. It is stupid. Don't be stupid. What they are doing is stupid. And reckless, for themselves and for other people and it has to stop.
WATT: And he has a message for police departments. Make people wear masks.
CUOMO: They have to enforce the law. That is the only line between anarchy and civilization.
WATT: Nick Watt, CNN, Los Angeles.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
LEMON: All right, Nick, thank you very much for that. Next, answers to questions about kids, and the coronavirus.
[23:15:00]
How can we make our schools safe? I will ask an expert.
LEMON: Florida teachers, suing to overturn Governor Ron DeSantis' emergency order forcing schools in that state to reopen. That as we learn more about what role kids play in the spread of the coronavirus. Let's discuss now, from former Harvard Medical School Professor, William Haseltine. He is the author of the new e-book.
It's called ""A Family Guide to COVID."" And it is much needed so, doctor, thank you. Professor, I should say, thank you so much for joining. You talked in the e-book about how virus transmits in children.
The virus transmit in children, now researchers in South Korea have found that children between the ages of 10 and 19 can transmit the virus just as much as adults and that children nine and under transmit the virus at a lower rate. What does that mean though for reopening schools?
[23:20:10]
DR. WILLIAM HASELTINE, CHAIR AND PRESIDENT ACCESS HEALTH INTERNATIONAL: Well, I think that every parent knows about cold viruses. And this is a cold virus for the very bad habit. We know, if you send your kids to school, they come back with colds and they give those colds to you? That is exactly what happens with this virus too.
And what the Korean study shows, is yes, kids nine to 19, spread the virus like adults, but kids a little bit younger, don't spread it so rapidly, but the catch there is they have three times as many contacts as the older people.
So it averages it out the spread about the same. And as you've heard earlier in your program today and reread across the country, young children are getting severely ill and unfortunately some are dying.
LEMON: I want to play this for you. This is Missouri's governor, what he said today about the kids going back to school. Watch this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GOV. MIKE PARSON (R-MO): These kids have got to get back to school, they are at the lowest risk possible. And if they do get COVID-19, which they will, and they will when they go to school. They are not going to the hospitals. They are not going to have to set in doctor offices. They are going to go home and they are going to get over it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
LEMON: What do you think of that, is that message dangerous--
HASELTINE: I think he should talk to the mother who just lost her children. I have friends whose son, grandson barely made it. Just barely made it. They rushed him to the hospital, he needed six people to attend him, to get him back alive. And he was in the hospital for weeks and he will have heart damage for the rest of his life. This is not a joke.
So, let me say, there's a very thorough study that everybody should take look at. Our national academy of sciences which includes medicine, science and engineering put out a detailed report on the question of should kids go back to school? And I have to say, the most unsettling part of that is it admits outright, we don't know the answers.
And therefore, if you don't know the answers you don't proceed blindly. There's something else I would like to say that I talked about in the book a lot. And that is a hierarchy of risk. People when they considering to send their kids back to school should think, first of all, what is the risk? How many people around me are infected? You can find that out by looking at your zip code or your county? How many people are there, if it's more than one or two per zip code, you could be in trouble? The second thing is, do I have a risk? Am I sick? Is my kids sick? Does he have diabetes? Is he over weight, does he have asthma or does anybody in my family have that that is at higher risk? Then you start to look at the schools. And I can tell you, that there is no guidance and the national academy of reports said the same thing. There is no federal guidance. There's a very vague rules and some very vague questions. And it's driving teachers and parents completely nuts.
They don't know, we have some answers in our book. And I'm writing a new book on the topic of how you decide what to do for your kids in school. For both your k-6 and your k-12, which are two different kinds of problems. But it is a huge problem that I think this is going to be the tipping point where people don't think mostly about politics, they think about their kids. Is this world safe for my kids and who has made it safe and who has made it more dangerous?
LEMON: Professor, thank you for your time, I appreciate it.
HASELTINE: Thank you.
LEMON: Protests by professional athletes against racial injustice is spreading tonight. Several players and coaches for the San Francisco Giants including their new manager Gabe Kapler, taking a knee during a national anthem before the team's exhibition game tonight against the rival Oakland A's. Kapler has spoken out about racial issues and athletes roles in sparking change.
President Trump doubling down on divisive rhetoric, stirring up culture wars as the election nears. But is he stereotyping his own supporters?
[23:25:00]
LEMON: Need to report some breaking news to you right now. President Trump's former attorney, Michael Cohen, is suing Attorney General Bill Barr. Cohen is alleging that Barr's sent him back to prison as retaliation for a tell-all-book he is writing about his years as Trump's fixer.
Cohen calls it a violation of his free speech right and he is seeking his immediate release from prison. President's former attorney, Michael Cohen, suing Attorney General Bill Barr over free speech according to Cohen, about a book that he is writing.
We will continue to follow that story and give you updates as we get it. Now I want to turn to the 2020 presidential election. Less than four months away. Can you believe it? The president doubling down on a tactic that has work for him so far and that promoting divisive or racist rhetoric in an effort to appeal to his base. Like for instance, going on Fox News to appeal to southern voters who he claims love their confederate flag. Here it is.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: When people proudly have their confederate flag, they are not talking about racism, they love their flags, it represents the south. They like the south. People right now, like the south. I say, it's freedom of many things, but its freedom of speech.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
[23:30:00]
LEMON: So let's discuss now. Liam Donovan is a Republican strategist and a former National Republican Senatorial Committee aide. And Mitch Landrieu is here, as well. He is a CNN political commentator and former mayor of New Orleans, of course. Gentlemen, thank you so much for joining.
So, Mayor Landrieu, I'm going to start with you. People right now like the south, he says, you know, what does the south mean to this president?
MITCH LANDRIEU, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, FORMER NEW ORLEANS MAYOR: Well, the president has a misunderstanding of what the south is, what people believe, where they came from, and what we revere. People from the south are patriotic. We can certainly tell the difference between people that are trying to rip the United States of America apart for the cause of preserving slavery and those that are not.
I'm a white guy, I'm from the south, and I don't remember the confederacy well at all. I don't think that represents who we are in the south. What he is doing is, again, trying to recapture the southern strategy that was implemented by President Nixon. There's a long sorted history about it.
I think people in America can see through this really, really clearly. I don't think they are going to buy it this time. I think people understand what the confederacy was about. And this is not about the First Amendment. This is about what America is, who we are as people, what we trust, what we believe in, and what we think is good for the country.
LEMON: Listen. It's your personal business. If you want to fly a confederate flag at your home, that's your business, right? If you want to carry it around, you want to wear -- that is your own personal business. The difference is people are saying it shouldn't be affront in businesses and federal buildings and that's the difference, right?
LANDRIEU: Well, there's a clear difference. I mean, everybody has got a First Amendment right to say what they want, when they want, so long as the reach of your fist does not meet my nose in terms of your personal behavior.
But in terms of the government, putting monuments on public property in reverence of the confederacy, it is a completely different story, or having the names of army or marine or navy bases named after confederate soldier who sought to destroy the country. The public can tell the difference between two. The president is doing what the president does. We know who he is. The question is who are we? That's what this -- that's not what this election is going to be about.
LEMON: Liam, I want to bring you in now because you've quoted in The New York Times, The New York Times article titled ""Trump Promotes Caricature of What Conservatives Want.""
Here is what you said. ""His intimate connection with the base is one of shared grievance, but when it comes to what they're for, it inevitably comes off like a cartoon version of what a New York billionaire would think conservatives believe.""
Are you saying that he is stereotyping his own base, Liam?
LIAM DONOVAN, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST, FORMER NATIONAL REPUBLICAN SENATORIAL COMMITTEE AIDE: Well, I think when he makes these sorts of comments, whether it's about the confederate flag, whether it's about how we should treat, you know, abortion, he says things that come across both as instancy and as tone deaf.
He doesn't quite -- you know, he hasn't thought through these issues. He doesn't have any sense of sort of nuance. He just comes in there with this sort of hand-fisted lines that don't connect in the same way that it does when he is, you know, throwing haymakers at enemies that Republicans share.
So, I think that is where he is on shakier ground. It's showing in an environment like this where you need more than just harnessing anger because people are scared, people are concerned about their jobs, they are concerned about their health and their safety.
And so I think, you know, this is something that worked in 2016, a time of relative peace and prosperity against someone who can project all these negative feelings on. It's a lot harder in this environment where the fundamentals are turned upside down. We are in a profound state of disruption. He is running against somebody who is a relatively, you know, sort of vanilla figure that is much harder to turn into a super villain.
LEMON: Mayor, from the start, Trump has uttered some of the most blatantly racist sentiments. Listen to this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
D. TRUMP: When Mexico sends its people, they are not sending their best. They are bringing drugs. They are bringing crime. They are rapists.
They didn't put themselves down as neo-Nazis, and you had some very bad people in that group. But you also had people that were very fine people on both sides.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over): Why do you keep calling this the Chinese virus? There are reports of dozens of incidents of bias against Chinese Americans in the country. D. TRUMP: Because it comes from China.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over): So what you're saying is racist.
D. TRUMP: It's not racist at all.
CATHERINE HERRIDGE, CBS NEWS SENIOR INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT: Why are African Americans still dying at the hands of law enforcement in this country?
D. TRUMP: And so are white people. So are white people. What a terrible question to ask. So are white people. More white people, by the way. More white people.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
LEMON: So, listen. People think it's a strategy. I mean, could it -- isn't it that the president is just really racist?
LANDRIEU: I think that there's no question that he is. And this is really simple. This is not hard. When you judge people not based on their behavior, individual behavior, but you judge them based on the color of their skin, you judge them based on their religion, you make broad characterizations of them because of immutable characteristics.
[23:35:06]
LANDRIEU: That is the very essence of racism. It all comes from the same fruit of the poison, the tree of hatred. People know what that's like. Americans are not foolish, notwithstanding this very difficult time that way. And I have a great faith in the American people, that when called into this moment, they are going to do what they have been called to do.
We have sorted events in our history based on race and it really is it's troubling to have that amount of vitriol coming from the most powerful person in the world. It is clear that President Trump issues the power of the presidency to divide us. That is not what the power is supposed to be used for.
And I think the people of America are going to turn away from that. I don't think they are going to be susceptible to it although there are certain elements of our community that are susceptible to it. But I don't think it's going to work this time.
LEMON: Liam, listen. I am up against the wall because I have the breaking news here. But quickly, what is he going to have to do to turn these poll numbers around? It's hitting like -- quit doing things that he is doing now?
DONOVAN: Well, it's an approach of just trying to sit, tweet law and order, and beat Joe Biden up as, you know, the second coming of, you know, the sort of arch leftist. It is not just convincing. I think he needs to stand up and try to convince people that he is serious about getting this virus under control, keeping them safe, and trying to turn things back around for this country.
LEMON: All right. Thank you, Liam. Thank you, mayor. I appreciate it. President Trump is threatening to send federal law enforcement to cities of democratic leadership, including Chicago. Is it an abuse of power? Former DNI James Clapper is going to weigh in, next.
[23:40:00]
LEMON: President Trump is addressing the deployment of federal forces to Portland and saying more could be on the way.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
D. TRUMP: We are looking at Chicago, too. We are looking at New York. Look at what is going on. All run by Democrats. This is worse than Afghanistan by far. This is worse than anything anyone has ever seen.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
LEMON: So Chicago's mayor, Lori Lightfoot, responding tonight, saying on Twitter, ""Mr. President or not, I don't care one bit what your name is. I will not allow troops in Chicago, and I will do everything in my power to stop you.""
Let's talk to CNN National Security Analyst James Clapper now, the former director of National Intelligence. Director, thank you so much for coming on to discuss this topic. It's very important. It appears that President Trump may already be ramping up this campaign.
CNN is reporting that DHS is preparing to send 150 agents to Chicago for up to 60 days. And this new deployment really has you worried about what is happening in America, doesn't it?
JAMES CLAPPER, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST, FORMER DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: It absolutely does, Don. I think this is scary. It's chilling. And you know, I watched the earlier segment when you interviewed Mayor Wheeler of Portland. And some of the images there kind of reminded me of John Lewis, you know, a great icon that we just lost in his struggle on the bridge in Selma.
I read a New York Times report tonight about United States Naval Academy commission officer graduate who had previously kind of ignored the demonstrations and saw fit to show up because he was so concerned about it, confronted one of the toy soldiers and said, ask them about his compliance with the Constitution.
And the response was, he got struck in his right hand with a baton and he got peppered sprayed. This is the sort of thing that goes on in banana republics or, you know, Hitler's SS or something. This is really scary.
And the nightmare scenario that concerns me is if -- let's just for the sake of discussion, not that I, you know, suggesting or know that it's going to happen -- is suppose Governor Pritzker, for example, in Illinois, decides to call out the National Guard, his own Illinois National Guard to protect the citizens of Chicago against these federal marauders, this is I guess the president's own version of martial law since the real military is kind of pushed back from doing that.
To me, it is a great concern.
LEMON: When you talk about third world countries and you mentioned Hitler tactics, you mean the tactics, not the beliefs, right?
CLAPPER: Yes, that's what I'm talking about.
LEMON: Yeah.
CLAPPER: The tactics. This is just not supposed to happen in this country.
LEMON: Yeah.
CLAPPER: And, you know, think about the legacy of John Lewis and what he was striving for, and then here we are in 2020, we haven't got there yet.
LEMON: Yeah. Listen. And some of the tactics that we are seeing from federal forces in Portland, I mean, quite honestly, they are brutally violent. Look at this. We are also seeing protesters snatched up by unidentified officers. Keep in mind that this is all being done on American soil to people exercising their right to protest.
And this administration is saying let's do more of this in more places. As you said, this isn't supposed to happen in America, but they are saying let's do more in more places.
[23:45:00]
CLAPPER: Well, yeah, but it's only going to be in democratic- controlled places. You know, we are not going to interfere with any of the Republican governors who are mismanaging the response to the pandemic. That's OK. We lost needlessly thousands of lives.
But in this case, you know, once again, play to the base, and use these extraordinary tactics. To me, it's just -- just speaking as a private citizen, it's a great concern.
LEMON: Yeah. Hey, listen, the incident that you mentioned earlier, director of the man wearing the navy shirt, we have it. We can discuss that. Let's play it.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey! Hey! Hey!
LEMON (voice-over): Yeah, wow. I mean, when you look at that, are these federal officers abusing their oaths of office?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CLAPPER: Well, I certainly believe they are. And I also think this reflects -- these people have not been trained for this kind of a mission. They are dressing up like soldiers but they are not behaving that way. And in my view, they are violating their oath when they behave like that. I think it is absolutely reprehensible.
LEMON: Director, thank you so much. I will see you soon.
CLAPPER: Thanks, Don.
LEMON: Thank you. Oregon's attorney general, while suing several federal agencies over the actions taken against protesters in Portland, she joins me, next.
[23:50:00]
LEMON: Federal forces are continuing to respond to protests with extreme violence this weekend. But President Trump says his officers are trying to help Portland, not hurt it.
Joining me now is Ellen Rosenblum, the attorney general of the state of Oregon. Thank you, attorney general. I appreciate you joining. You said that the president is getting bad intelligence if he thinks the presence of federal officers is not making things worse in Portland.
ELLEN ROSENBLUM, OREGON ATTORNEY GENERAL: Correct. You know, Don, every American needs to be concerned about what's happening here in Portland. As has already been noted, we're not the first city where this is going to happen.
This -- by bringing these troops into Portland and that's basically what they are, they're untrained troops, they don't know how to deescalate tense situations. We certainly have had some of that over the past couple of months.
Instead, they are escalating the problems here. And whatever intelligence the president is getting is just absolutely wrong. He needs to take these guys out of here, send them back home.
Don't send them anywhere else because I wouldn't wish that upon any other city in this country. This is all a political ploy and it is not only not doing good, it is doing harm, doing harm to the people of my state and my inner city.
LEMON: Attorney general, I have to say you've actually filed a lawsuit against DHS, the Marshal Service, CBP, and the Federal Protection Service. You say their actions --
ROSENBLUM: Yeah.
LEMON: -- violate the civil rights of Oregonians. Explain why you felt this lawsuit was necessary.
ROSENBLUM: Well, they are violating the United States Constitution. You know, the Constitution has not been suspended for federal agents any more than it is for anyone else. They are violating the First Amendment. This is a prior restraint on our peaceful protesters' ability to get out at night and to protest police brutality, to protest racial injustice.
They are also violating the Fourth and the Fifth Amendment of the United States constitution. So we had to bring this lawsuit for the reason that the people of Oregon are being harmed. And I'm the attorney general and it's my job as the top legal officer of the state to ensure the safety and also the legal rights of our citizens.
But also to send a message to Mr. Trump and to these federal agencies that they need to stop thinking that they can come and do good here. In fact, what they're doing is not only violating the Constitution by these acts of, you know, jumping out of vehicles, unmarked, rental vans, and grabbing people off the streets, but they are also causing physical harm.
They're actually causing physical harm. You just showed a video. And that particular gentleman, that case has now been included in a criminal investigation that I have opened here in Oregon.
LEMON: Yeah. In your suit, you specifically mentioned an instance where unidentified federal law officers arrest an individual, whisked him away in an unmarked van, similar to the one that we are showing on the screen now. Is the lack of transparency with these detainments part of the reason you think there is such a problem?
ROSENBLUM: Well, certainly a problem in that these federal agents haven't even indicated who they are. And, here, in Oregon, we've had some issues with some right-wing folks who come dressed similar to what these agents look like.
So Mr. Pettibone didn't even know -- that is the gentleman you're referring to -- he didn't even know who they were and he was whisked away. This beanie he was wearing was pulled over his face. He was taken away. He didn't even know where he was being taken to. And then he was released about an hour or two later after asserting his right to remain silent.
LEMON: Are there any other legal options that you have to get them out of your state?
[23:55:04]
ROSENBLUM: Well, of course, our governor and our Portland mayor have tried to do that. They have asked them to leave politely and firmly. They have simply refused to leave. So I would say that, you know, our lawsuit is not about forcing them to leave the state. It is about forcing them to comply with the law, to comply with the Constitution.
We also are going to make -- bring them to account by investigating them criminally to see whether these actions that they have taken including striking an individual so severely with a projectile that he has been in hospital for a week and only now looks like he is going to recover but has had surgery, has had brain bleed, has had reconstructive facial surgery.
This is not -- this is not a situation where federal agents are coming in to help. They are harming. They are escalating. And apparently, they're untrained, according to a memo that --
LEMON: Yeah.
ROSENBLUM: -- has been received by the homeland security head. But apparently, he is denying it. So I haven't seen it myself. But apparently, these agents have not received the kind of training that you to have in order to come into a situation like Portland and do good.
LEMON: Attorney general, thank you for your time. Unfortunately, we are out of time. Come back and update us. Thank you so much.
ROSENBLUM: Thank you very much for having me.
LEMON: And thanks for watching, everyone. Our coverage continues.",Bias Incident
66,/content/Bias_Incident_Lexis_1.DOCX,South China Morning Post.com,2020-07-04,7516 words,LIF,by Eric Fish,,How strained US-China relations are playing out in American universities,False,"As bilateral ties between the two superpowers deteriorate, hundreds of thousands of mainland Chinese students at universities in the United States are caught in the middle. And as witnessed at New York's University of Rochester, political discourse can often turn ugly 
Last November, in the dead of night, dozens of paint-wielding students descended into a concrete tunnel. They were decked out all in black, faces hidden behind surgical masks. Everyone had been advised to remove any identifying markers, tell a trusted friend where they were headed, and leave their phones behind to avoid being tracked. 
They scrawled messages such as ""Re-education camps are prisons"", ""We are all Hongkongers"", and ""Save Tibet, our people are burning"". Then, in the red and yellow of the Chinese flag on the tunnel entrance, ""CENSOR THIS"". 
It was the third such paint job in as many days at the University of Rochester, in New York state. Much of what appeared had been there earlier in the week, but hours after the originals were put up, a group assembled by a Chinese student organisation covered them with their own messages, to counteract those critical of China with ""positive energy"", they said.

The university tunnels were built to allow warm passage between buildings during frigid winters, but for nearly half a century, one stretch has been open to paint on, providing a focal point for campus political discourse, and over the preceding few months the discourse had been ugly. The ""tunnel wars"", as they came to be known, were the culmination of an acrimonious semester. 
As the coronavirus outbreak has spread, already abysmal United States-China relations have been thrown into a tailspin. Caught in the middle are nearly 370,000 Chinese students enrolled in American universities, 2,300 of whom attend the University of Rochester, 19 per cent of its student body. 
The Trump administration recently barred Chinese graduate students with links to universities with ill-defined connec­tions to the Chinese military from entering the US. Republican Senator Tom Cotton suggested one policy response to make China ""pay the consequences"" for Covid-19 could be to ""stop allowing hundreds of thousands of Chinese students to come to our universities, many of which are the children of Communist Party officials"". 
But even before the pandemic, Chinese students were becoming an increasingly fraught political issue. 
As their numbers have swollen at campuses across the US, so have clashes over events and discourse thought to be at odds with Beijing's political sensibilities. From a Dalai Lama com­mence­­ment speech at the University of California, San Diego, to a Columbia University human-rights dialogue, some Chinese students have protested such events, sometimes demanding they be cancelled. Others have reported fear of expressing politically taboo viewpoints, lest they be reported by classmates to authorities. 
This has raised concerns that some students have become conduits of ""the watchful eyes and occasionally heavy hand of the Chinese government"", as The New York Times put it, be it via direct guidance from consular officials, self-motivated careerism or sincere nationalist sentiment. Some of these concerns have spilled over into outright hostility. 
""It's disgusting to see that all this is happening in America as Chinese students come here to take technology and acquire skills to use against us, and then openly display their loathing for democracy and freedom in return,"" declared an article in conservative online magazine American Thinker. 
But others say most Chinese students involved in campus politics are exercising, not suppressing free speech, and doing so in ways hardly alien to American colleges. 
Last spring, the University of Rochester College Republicans - a student political club - hosted an event about religious extremism in the Middle East. Featuring a controversial speaker and falling six days after the Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand, it drew claims of insensitivity and Islamophobia. More than 270 students signed an online petition calling, unsuccess­fully, for it to be cancelled. 
Controversial events and subsequent protests were nothing new for the College Republicans on the largely liberal campus. But for the autumn semester, the club decided it would turn down the heat and focus on topics its leadership thought would be less contentious: human rights abuses in Tibet and Xinjiang. 
""I thought it was non-controversial,"" says Anthony Pericolo, then a senior student and president of the College Republicans. ""Basically, we would highlight democratic values, how the Dalai Lama supports them, and how he's a huge proponent of the US Constitution, which Republicans are governed by."" 
Two separate public talks featuring, respectively, Dalai Lama representatives and a Uygur human rights advocate were announced. But Sampson Hao, a junior and president of the university's Chinese Students' Association (CSA), a social and cultural group comprised mostly of undergraduates from mainland China, ""received concerns from a lot of Chinese students saying that [the events] could threaten the public image and reputation of the Chinese students on campus"". 
Two weeks before the Tibet event, Hao met with the College Republicans to discuss these concerns, saying he just wanted more information so CSA could determine whether the events might jeopardise the safety or ""feelings"" of Chinese students, who could then be informed accordingly. Pericolo said he wanted to stress that the event wasn't anti-China or directed against Chinese students, but felt the CSA became ""pushy"" over documents and specific questions that would be asked, which he wasn't able or willing to give. 
Hao also sent an email to university administrators: ""The speaker is here to talk about a controversial topic that belittles the Chinese government and the people. How would audiences with limited under­standing about China view the Chinese community after listening to the speech? Imagine: your understanding of the culture and the history of the United States is a blank sheet of paper, and someone gives an agitative speech on the holding camp of Japanese by US in California during World War II."" 
One week before the Tibet event in September, an unrelated open dialogue was held to discuss the ongoing demonstrations in Hong Kong, which the CSA co-organised with the university's Hong Kong Students Association. Protests had been raging in Hong Kong for more than three months over a litany of grievances with Beijing. Hong Kong students around the world voiced support for peers demonstrating for their city's autonomy back home, but were increasingly being confronted by mainland counter protesters - sometimes violently. 
""Their motivation, I think, is that they'd read about uglier incidents between main­land [Chinese] and Hong Kong students at other universities,"" says John Osburg, associate professor of anthropology at the University of Rochester, who was asked to moderate the event. ""I think they wanted to avoid those kinds of incidents and present the Chinese students on campus as a little more open-minded."" 
Osburg says not one mainland Chinese student at the dialogue expressed sympathy for the protests. ""That's something I wonder about a lot - if they would even feel comfortable articulating those kinds of views,"" he says, noting that in his course on Chinese society, mainland students are often critical of Chinese policies when speaking privately. ""Occasionally they are in class as well, but it seems increasingly like they are a little more reluctant to express critical views."" 
He is right. One mainland Chinese under­graduate in the audience found some points his compatriots made to be ridiculous. ""Some of those arguments were so funny and so easy to debate against - I really wanted to go up and talk, but I couldn't,"" he recalls, speaking anonymously for fear of retaliation, using the pseudonym Tingting. ""Peer pressure is one thing and safety is another, because I'm a Chinese citizen."" 
In the end, those who did speak up mostly just talked past one another, Osburg says. ""So as a dialogue, to be honest, I didn't think it was particularly successful. But at the very least, there was some civility. People weren't shouting at each other."" 
One of the main debaters at the event, a Chinese sophomore and political science major named Xu Yifan, regarded it as a success. ""I felt like we had a very good example during the Hong Kong dialogue,"" he says. ""We [mainland and Hong Kong students] had a better relationship after that event."" 
When Xu found out about the College Republicans' Tibet event, he was upset by its ""one-sidedness"" for including only speakers affiliated with the Dalai Lama, despite being advertised as a dialogue. ""That's not a dialogue,"" he says. ""It's kind of political propaganda - trying to spread how the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] treats Tibetans so badly."" 
Xu was born in rural Anhui province and saw the fruits of China's rapid, authori­tarian-directed growth first hand as living standards in his hometown improved. His father started a successful business, making enough to give Xu an American college education. So the way Xu sees it, extensive individual rights are a worthy goal for the future, but they should take a back seat to development - particularly in poorer regions such as Tibet. 
""When you find people like farmers in China and ask about freedom of speech, democracy, the right to vote, they only care if they can raise their children,"" he says. 
Xu claims there are aspects to the Tibet situation glossed over in Western media and prevailing American understandings of the region - namely, that the Communist Party's hardline policies stem from concerns of terrorism. ""[Americans] do have freedom of speech,"" he says. ""But you definitely need to consider how Chinese students consider the events."" 
Xu found five other Chinese students to help crystallise his arguments and asked the event's organiser, College Republican member Se Hoon Kim, if they could give a rebuttal at the event. Kim offered five minutes during the Q&A and thought that had settled the matter. But over the next few days, he began hearing of an unauthorised event flier posted by Xu's group around campus. ""'Freedom' or Terrorism: Truth Behind Tibet"", it read, accompanied by photos that would create more controversy. 
Gongyal, a Tibetan sophomore, was furious when he saw the flier. He had fled Tibet with his family to India when he was 12 years old - a 27-day journey he said involved hiding in a furniture truck, walking through snow-covered mountains, and going days without food. But it allowed him to study at a Tibetan school and learn his native language and religion without suppression from Chinese authorities. 
The two photos on Xu's flier came from violent protests that rocked the Tibetan capital of Lhasa in 2008, and Gongyal took special exception to one of them. ""There are thousands of pictures out there but he chose to use this one, and I believe he has a target for doing that,"" he says. ""They put up a picture that depicts a person self-immolating in the street of Lhasa, burning themself alive, and he's putting that picture as 'freedom or terrorism'."" 
Most of the campus, the student news­paper, the College Republicans and even Xu accepted this characterisation of the photo. ""After the event, we realised the picture was self-immolating and we felt a little bit terrible,"" Xu says. ""For Tibetan students, that matters, that's a sensitive thing and we respect that. So I apologised, but after that, the College Republicans said that we inten­tionally used the self-immolation picture, and that's not true."" 
But unbeknown to Xu and everyone else involved, the photo wasn't what it appear­ed. It was the first of many misunderstand­ings that would exacerbate tensions. 
Four days before the Tibet dialogue, College Republicans representatives met with the dean of students, Matthew Burns, to discuss the event. ""You strike fear in the hearts of some of the Chinese students,"" Burns said at the meeting, as confirmed by a recording. ""Do you understand why?"" 
He mentioned the University of Calgary, in Alberta, Canada, which awarded the Dalai Lama an honorary degree in 2009, followed soon thereafter by the Chinese government taking it off its list of accredit­ed foreign uni­versities. The move reported­ly prompted some Chinese students at the institution to transfer for fear they wouldn't be able to get jobs in China, though the accreditation was restored in 2011. 
Burns also cited the Dalai Lama's 2017 commencement address at the University of California, San Diego, which was followed by a Chinese Ministry of Edu­cation scholarship council ceasing funding for new scholars to attend the college. 
""Your being here does not mean I don't want you to have this programme,"" Burns assured the College Republicans' representatives. ""I will not shut down your programme, I'm not going to tell you what to do - never have, never will [...] But I also want you to walk into this wide-awake. Our Chinese students are fearful not because you're having pro­grammes about China, they're fearful that their government is watching what they do, and if they attend your programme, their degree might be meaningless in their country."" 
Erich Spaker, the College Republicans' vice-president, says he walked away further convinced the school would rather the events did not happen. ""Administration has gone out of their way to not say any­thing that can be construed as interfering with us,"" he says. ""But it has also been clear from some of our interactions with them that they really aren't happy about these events."" 
Burns denies this. ""I can see them saying that,"" he says. ""But I don't think I'm known on campus for saying something I don't mean. If I thought they should cancel the event, I would have said I think you should cancel the event. I would never tell them they had to."" 
Burns acknowledges Chinese students have become important to the university financially, but denies being intimidated by the prospect of the Chinese government trying to diminish enrolment. ""I think it was a thought in my mind,"" he recalls. ""But as soon as it comes in my mind, I think, 'But this isn't a Chinese institution. If this happens, it happens. American education ought not be influenced by what the Chinese government mandates.'"" 
Later, in a meeting with the College Republicans, Burns added one more note of caution, saying they should account for the possibility that some Chinese students protesting their event might benefit from it. ""Whether or not they agree with it, many of them are government sponsored and looking for positions in the [Communist] Party. That'll look good for them."" 
The Tibet event was attended by only a few dozen people. Xu and his group handed out 13-page pamphlets they had compiled to counter what they described as ""one-sided political propaganda"". Several conclusions it drew were dubious, though the preface acknowledged it was thrown together quickly and ""may not be perfect"". 
Xu says he never wanted the event cancelled and was happy to see discussion of sensitive Tibet issues - something he thought his Chinese classmates should be exposed to. He doesn't necessarily even think what the Dalai Lama representatives said was wrong. ""There's definitely some subjective opinions, but I think that's OK,"" he says. ""We have freedom of speech here. We're in the United States, but like, try to hear another side."" 
He rushed through his five-minute rebuttal, flipping through the pamphlet as the audience jeered. Afterwards, Kim held up one of the controversial posters and excoriated Xu for what he said was ""grounds for defamation"" in mis­representing the event and using a self-immolation picture. 
In fact, the flier did not depict a self-immolation - something nobody involved seemed aware of until the reporting of this story. One photo showed wreckage of a burned-out motorcycle at the Lhasa protests, and the other, debris being burned by protesters. 
Regardless, few appeared swayed by Xu's arguments. ""There wasn't a single person in the audience that bought a single word from that packet,"" says Spaker. ""I think the fact that they did that gave an idea of the political landscape in China [...] it indicates a level of propaganda, state control, lack of freedom of ideas and the brainwashing that goes on."" 
But Spaker doesn't necessarily think Xu and the others have been brainwashed. ""I think they know exactly what they're doing,"" he says. ""Chinese students in the United States, by and large, the way they get here is they're children of somewhat powerful party members. I think it might be more along the lines of like, they're playing the game, they're trying to win points back in the mainland."" 
There exists, however, no data on what proportion of Chinese students in the US have Communist Party family members (much less ""powerful"" party members). A 2018 survey of Chinese students at Purdue University, in Indiana, found 13 per cent were themselves party members, though membership isn't necessarily an indicator of ideological belief or government ties. 
Many join simply as a curriculum vitae booster, and plenty among China's emergent middle and upper classes can afford a foreign education without the benefit of political connections. Xu laughs at the idea he is trying to win points with the party, saying his only connection is that his grandfather was a member (along with 90 million other Chinese). 
He did try to join while at the University of Rochester out of a patriotic desire to somehow help China, but when he emailed the consulate, he received a terse reply saying it doesn't offer this service. Just as well. ""Joining the CCP brings nothing good for me now,"" he says. ""If I pursue a further degree, or try to get a job with a PhD in the United States later, it could bring problems."" 
After the Tibet event, Kim and Xu shook hands and it seemed to mark the end of a minor conflict. Then something happened that would elevate tensions into a campuswide controversy. 
Two days after the Tibet dialogue, Kim, Gongyal, and a few other Tibetan students met three Buddhist monks at a student union Starbucks, where they discussed Buddhism and meditation. But then, according to Kim's account, a Chinese student set up a chair with a printout that said, ""Tibet is part of China"". 
Kim says things escalated, with two other Chinese students joining and trying to instigate a conflict. He and the monks, feeling threatened and confused, got up to leave. ""As we walked towards the exit, they were coming so aggressively that, honestly, we basically got chased out."" 
None of the Chinese students involved could be reached for comment. 
Word of the incident spread quickly, with several different versions of what had happened, including some demon­strably false rumours. Some Chinese students without Facebook accounts joined the social media platform speci­fically to air their views; some expressed regret and stressed those involved didn't represent them, while others argued over Tibet, Communist Party rule and what constitutes ""terrorism"". 
In what would become a recurring theme, students making arguments on both sides frequently made exaggerated or unsubstantiated claims and shared links from dubious sources to bolster their points, ranging from the Falun Gong-backed Epoch Times to the Communist Party's Xinhua news agency. 
Antipathy was intensifying beyond Facebook. The University of Rochester allows students to report ""bias-related incidents"" of discrimination based on ethnicity or national origin. In the weeks after the Starbucks incident, more than 50 such reports were submitted. 
According to the student newspaper, Campus Times, some students - Tibetan, Chinese and others - were ""beginning to feel unsafe, targeted. Some had stopped going to class. Others were having nightmares"". Gongyal says he felt neglected by the university. ""They never mentioned anything about us [Tibetan students], how we feel unsafe being a minority on campus - just five students."" 
Many Chinese students also felt uncomfortable. On an anonymous Facebook message board, one complained of wide­spread discrimination. ""Most of us are pretty simple, focusing on study, willing to make friends and step out of our comfort zones,"" the post said. ""But now I may be grabbed by someone in the Starbucks, asked to take a side, forced to comment on incidents that I have no idea [about] at all, and regarded as 'brainwashed' and 'spy'."" 
Efua Agyare-Kumi, a student reporter who covered the events for Campus Times, says one thing exacerbating tensions was that Chinese students were already rela­tively isolated on campus. ""So I think some people were struggling to find a sense of empathy,"" she says. ""When this happened, people found it so easy to villainise. You can't attach a face to the Chinese students here if you've never gotten to know any."" 
Making matters more contentious was the College Republicans' second upcoming event, on the large-scale detention of Muslim Uygurs in Xinjiang. Hao, the CSA president, says that after the Starbucks incident, a shadow was cast over Chinese students at the university, and many were starting to ""feel threatened emotionally and even physically"". So he submitted a letter to the All-Campus Judicial Council, a student body that addresses alleged violations of the student conduct standard. 
""Given the significant biases within such events, we request the school to cancel the upcoming Uyghur event to avoid potential conflicts,"" it read. ""Moreover, for the future, we would like the school to investigate into events that are potentially political to see whether there are perceived biases."" 
Hao later claimed he never wanted the event to be cancelled; his main grievance was that the College Republicans weren't being transparent or sensitive to how Chinese students were being treated. ""It has nothing to do with politics, nothing about freedom of speech,"" he says. ""It's simply about harassment and bullying."" 
When Pericolo saw the letter, he was mortified that the CSA was trying to shut down his event, and it implied to him a connec­tion with incidents of the preceding weeks. He posted his own letter on Face­book calling for a conduct investigation into the CSA. 
The opposing letters spread on social media and, in a development rare for the College Republicans, campus sentiment overwhelmingly shifted to their side. Even the College Democrats issued a statement of support for them. 
Over the following days, students again clashed on Facebook. Memes aimed at the CSA were created, including one suggesting the group was wilfully blind to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and crack­down, even though it had never been an issue in the disputes. That week, Campus Times published an editorial criticising the widespread monolithic treatment of Chinese students, as well as the ""racist and stupid"" Tiananmen Square meme. Discourse is important, it concluded, ""but you need to be civil, open-minded, and humble. Not being racist helps."" 
Agyare-Kumi says some Chinese students she spoke to felt any opinion that wasn't a full-throated defence of democracy or condemnation of the Communist Party would be written off. ""There wasn't really any room for people to flesh out the complexities of their opinions,"" she says. 
""On the side of [students] who were for Western ideals, there was little attempt to [try to understand the other side]. But I did genuinely feel when I talked to Chinese students that they wanted me to under­stand where they were coming from and why. But that was always interpreted as, 'Oh, you're just going to say everything you've been brainwashed into by the Chinese government.'"" 
In recent times, anti-American rhetoric in China has increased under the nationalistic rule of Xi Jinping, and efforts to tighten the Communist Party's ideological grip have included overseas initiatives. One 2016 Ministry of Education document called for a network linking ""the motherland, embassies and consulates, overseas student groups, and the broad number of students abroad"" to harness ""patriotic energy"". 
Communist Party organs have all but incentivised students abroad to speak up on behalf of CCP-friendly viewpoints, praising them publicly when they do so, and some­times retaliating against those voicing criticism. After a graduating Chinese student at the University of Maryland gave a commencement speech in 2017 praising American freedom of speech and clean air (tacitly impugning China's lack thereof), she was vilified in state media and had to go into hiding. One Chinese student at the University of Minnesota was even sentenced to six months in prison on returning to China after posting tweets mocking Xi. 
Many Chinese students on American campuses say they are caught uncomfort­ably in the middle of the US-China conflict - afraid to air views that might rile any side. But others have found new strength in numbers. Coupled with the feeling that many Americans are ignorant or biased when it comes to China, some feel greater solidarity with compatriots and an instinctive need to speak up. 
This comes as ""culture wars"" have been intensifying on US campuses. Controversial speakers have routinely encountered cancellation attempts - from Senator John Cornyn at Texas Southern University to a former Immigration and Customs Enforcement official at the University of Pennsylvania - and some professors have been put on ideological ""watch lists"". 
Chinese students protesting over speakers critical of Beijing have grown to occupy a unique niche, sometimes invoking the language of liberal causes. When the Dalai Lama gave the commencement speech at the University of California, San Diego, some Chinese students and alumni protested on the grounds it violated ""diversity and inclusiveness"". Some adopted the hashtag #ChineseStudentsMatter. 
Prominent Republicans have drawn a connection. When Chinese students at Johns Hopkins University, in Maryland, started an online petition to cancel or reformat a talk with Hong Kong activists, Senator Cotton tweeted, ""CCP stooges are adopting tactics of the 'woke' left in an attempt to shut down free speech on American college campuses"". 
Hao says he has noticed that more Chinese students at the University of Rochester have become willing to speak out on a variety of issues in the past two or three years. ""And I see that totally as a good thing,"" he says. ""What's the norm? Chinese students being quiet, studious, good at math. It defeats the norm and that's good. We need diversification among Chinese students."" 
But attempts to align Hao with the American ""left"" are complicated by some of his other political views. He first moved to the US when he was 15 years old to attend a high school near Chicago that was ""extreme­ly liberal"" and the political correctness could seem obnoxious. ""I was tired of that BS,"" he says. ""We had a meeting every week talking about microaggressions or cultural appropriation - every week, a meeting for hours."" 
Going to the University of Rochester pushed him further to the right and increased his annoyance with liberal causes. ""A lot of people think it's hilarious to claim you're an American conservative while being a Chinese citizen, but I am. I can tell you with a straight face. Obviously, I also disagree with what Trump does, but I'm definitely not a current Democrat,"" he says. 
He describes Pericolo as a ""good kid"" with moderate conservative beliefs whom he respects. He says it was only their respective roles under the circumstances that led them to clash. ""We're basically like Hitler and Stalin,"" he jokes. ""They could have been great friends."" 
The CSA and College Republicans ultimately dropped their formal complaints and were encouraged to attend a ""restorative circle"" to resolve their conflict. But Pericolo was disappointed the university never made a public statement affirming students' freedom of speech, condemned the alleged harass­ment during the Starbucks incident, or punished Xu for making misleading event posters. He specu­lates that the fees derived from Chinese students enabled the alleged inaction. 
""Free speech was being jeopar­dised and there was potentially something more insidious happening on campus,"" he says. ""You know they want to minimise negative attention to the univer­sity, even if it means not clearly standing up for our rights."" But he was also disturbed by people throw­ing around terms like ""brainwashed"" to describe Chinese students. 
""I think that's very hurtful because that implies the Chinese here on campus are a monolith, which they're not,"" he says, noting some had privately expressed support for his events. ""And that also plays into what Xi Jinping is trying to do. He wants China to be a one-party communist monolith where people take what the party says as truth."" 
Hao is less bothered by the term. ""I don't think all Chinese people are not brain­washed,"" he says. ""A lot of Chinese are brainwashed by the Chinese govern­ment, just like a lot of Americans are brainwashed by Donald Trump."" 
The Uygur event that sparked so much conflict ultimately went off without a hitch, and the controversy seemed to bolster atten­dance - hundreds packed the audi­torium, compared with the few dozen at the Tibet event. The conflicts seemed to reach a detente, but it was short-lived. Another University of Rochester organisa­tion, the Chinese Students and Scholars Association (CSSA), had stayed uncharac­teristically quiet up to this point, but that was about to change. 
For 25 years, a University of Rochester lounge had displayed flags reflecting the student body's various nationalities. For International Education Week last November, they were updated to reflect the new cohort, but there was a new policy: regions not recognised as countries by the United Nations were moved to a separate space. The only two flags moved were those of Taiwan and Hong Kong, while Kosovo, also not recognised, remained in the main display. 
The change had been planned since the previous semester, but many students regarded the timing as suspect. ""This is yet another example of our spineless administration sacrificing campus unity to appease the loudest voices,"" wrote one on a university Facebook forum. ""Let's waste more time and university money skirting around the problem rather than stand up to China,"" wrote another. ""But China is university money,"" responded a third. 
A Reddit post with more than 2,100 upvotes falsely claimed the flags had been moved ""after several protests on campus were disrupted by Chinese national students"". There was no indication any sort of physical protest related to China had occurred at the university that semester, much less any disrupted by Chinese students. 
But for junior Warish Orko, the implied marginalisation of Taiwanese and Hong Kong students was bad enough. He had also been following the protests in Hong Kong and sympathised with its students at the university. ""I do care about making this campus feel like a welcoming space,"" he says. ""We're insulated and safe here."" 
After the flags were moved, Orko and others organised about a dozen students to paint murals of support in the tunnels. 
The mood was light as students from around the world painted flags of Taiwan and Tibet, along with yellow umbrellas to symbolise Hong Kong's democracy move­ment. There were messages in multiple languages saying such things as ""Stand with Muslims"", ""Free Tibet"", ""Free Hong Kong"", ""I love Dalai Lama"" and ""June 4, 1989"". 
""Music from all over the world played,"" Orko recounted in Campus Times, ""and while the words were lost on me, I didn't need to know the language to comprehend the spirit of solidarity."" 
Twenty-four hours later, it was all gone. 
The murals angered many Chinese students, some of whom felt phrases like ""Free Hong Kong"" and ""Free Tibet"" promoted independence from China; and that supporting Hong Kong protesters implied condoning violence against police and mainland Chinese. Some claimed the anti-Communist Party messages incited hatred against Chinese students. 
""Many of us have a connection to the CCP somehow,"" says one mainland student, who wishes to remain anonymous. ""If you can blatantly depict the CCP as evil on campus, how will that make us feel? Are you saying that all communists are evil? That my grandparents are evil? That I'm evil? Are we going to feel welcomed and safe? 
""Compare this to painting that Islam is evil after 9/11,"" he says. ""How will that make Muslim students feel?"" 
But not all Chinese students were angry. ""I thought the pictures were cool,"" says Tingting, the pseudonymous mainland undergraduate who had held his tongue at the earlier Hong Kong dialogue. ""I feel like it's a very weird nationalism [some main­land students displayed]. They didn't really want to hear what the other group was saying."" 
But few expressed sentiments like that in the WeChat groups that lit up after the painting spree. Some even floated the idea (perhaps jokingly) of fighting whoever painted the murals. Tingting recalls a student in one group suggesting calm and consideration on both sides, then being accused of not loving her country. 
""Someone said, 'If you don't want to participate in our movement, then remain silent, don't say a word,'"" Tingting says. ""I couldn't believe it. When we're hanging out or studying with friends, everyone seems normal and cool. But when this stuff was coming out, you suddenly felt like your friends became someone else."" 
Soon after the murals were painted, a CSSA executive board member posted a message on an open WeChat group. ""The CSSA has expressed fury and strongly condemned any anti-China messages that aim to split China and any actions that threaten Chinese students' safety,"" it read. ""We have already contacted the university and will reach out to the New York Consulate to take action."" 
The CSSA (which is entirely separate from the CSA) has chapters at hundreds of universities internationally that primarily facilitate social events, career networking and practical assistance to Chinese students navigating life abroad. Most chapters have contact with their regional Chinese consulate and receive some fund­ing - enough to cover activities such as an annual party - and help with practical issues such as student safety. But there have been documented instances of more politically charged coordination. 
The WeChat message said students must ""act rationally and cautiously"", and could help by filing bias reports or ""at 10:00pm today, we are going to paint words that promote positive energy in the tunnel. CSSA has prepared paint and brushes"". 
The CSSA didn't respond to a request for comment through its official email. But according to one CSSA leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, the intention was only to paint on one section adjacent to the original murals to present different views and ""positive messages"". 
""That was our original plan,"" the person says. ""But things went totally out of control."" 
Another CSSA member, also speaking on condition of anonymity, recalls that people were very emotional at this point, and there was little dissent about the proposal to paint in the tunnels. ""Most people were so worked up, so if I explicitly said you shouldn't go, or I won't go, that'll make it look like I'm betraying my country. It's peer pressure. The only thing I can do is not advocate that event in my circles or encourage anyone else to go."" 
Tingting says some friends went to the tunnels unenthusiastically. ""Lots of people didn't have a very strong reason. They don't think either side is completely right. They just felt, emotionally, they should go."" 
Dozens heeded the call, but an argument broke out when they arrived. A few were angry to the point of shouting, insisting all the murals should be painted over. Others tried to talk them down. ""But those people were very strong-willed,"" the CSSA leader says. ""Some students brought their own paint and brushes, so they just started painting over and we couldn't do anything about it. We just made sure they didn't paint anything too extreme."" 
Large animals were drawn to obscure previous images. ""I love Pandas"", ""Peace and Love"", ""Stop Violence"" and ""I love China. I'm from Xinjiang"" were among the messages written. A picture of a masked Hong Kong protester was altered in a way some later interpreted as a mocking caricature of a Muslim Uygur - though most Chinese students interviewed say it's unlikely that's what was intended. At one point, a man belted out a patriotic song in a loud operatic voice, and within two hours, most of the original murals were gone. 
The backlash was immediate. Orko and several other students posted an online petition titled ""Condemn Censorship at University of Rochester"", which garnered 630 signatures. ""The painting of racist caricatures is a hate crime. The silencing of refugees is a hate crime,"" it said. ""Hate groups such as the Chinese Students and Scholars Association must be barred from campus."" It went on to accuse the CSSA of creating an unsafe environment for Chinese students by passing information to Beijing about student activities. 
The CSSA leader acknowledges the group contacted the Chinese consulate after the original murals were painted, as well as the university's intercultural centre and a faculty adviser, but says it did so out of concern for students' well-being after seeing so many ""bad things"" painted about China. 
""We think this is putting risk to our safety, and these departments are all we can think of to support us,"" the person says. ""But the only thing the consulate told us is that this isn't hurting anyone's safety, so they can't do anything. They just said something like 'calm down and keep safe'."" 
The leader denied informing the consulate about other political events on campus, saying the CSSA would never report students for expressing taboo views. 
There is only a vague set of university guidelines as to what can be painted (or painted over) in the tunnels, none of which the CSSA or any other students violated that night. Nevertheless, some called for those students to be expelled and deported. 
Detractors began to appear in WeChat groups, saying those who had painted over murals had gone too far. Hao was among them. ""It doesn't matter what you paint, but you just shouldn't paint over others,"" he says. ""The CSSA is being so dumb. Once the Chinese [student] reputation gets ruined, it takes so much time and effort to rebound."" 
The CSSA leader argues that it was Hao who had hurt Chinese students' reputation earlier in the semester: ""Many Chinese students were angry, and thought what [the CSA] did made other students think we're so stupid. I think the majority of Chinese students don't support them sending that letter [calling for the Uygur event to be cancelled]. Just don't go to the event if you don't like it."" 
Soon after the CSSA's paint-over, others planned to replace what had been covered. An organiser published a list of guidelines regarding what to paint, how to maintain anonymity and a warning not to target Chinese students. More than 50 showed up, and after the murals were repainted, most remained into the following semester. Eventually, the univer­sity announced the flag display, which had sparked the tunnel wars, would be scrapped. 
Days later though, several new messages appeared on the tunnel walls. ""Thanks Trump"" and ""Support Hong Kong, build the wall"" appeared, as did pejorative Taiwanese and Cantonese idioms aimed at mainland Chinese, along with the phrase ""Mainland students, go back to the mainland"". 
This sparked another brief round of argu­ments and illustrated to some that unam­bigu­ous racism was present. Others speculated it was the work of a troll stirring up conflict. Turns out it was the latter. 
""I just wanted to poke fun and make my life more colourful,"" says Zhao Junyi, a University of Rochester student from Beijing who admitted painting the messages. ""If tension goes down, I just help boost it back up and make it more dramatic. I don't do drugs or substances, so it's the most inter­esting thing I can feel here in Rochester."" 
Zhao says he was ""really liberal"" during high school in Beijing, cared about human rights issues, and studied events such as the 1989 Tiananmen crack­down. A desire to learn more and broaden his horizons was one motivation to study in the US. ""I used to use a VPN, but I [couldn't] get over the firewall,"" he says. ""So I chose to go over the physical wall and go abroad."" 
In the US, he continued to disdain nationalistic Chinese classmates who jumped at the slightest whiff of China's ""national dignity"" being insulted. Gradually though, he was just as turned off by many of his classmates from the US and elsewhere, and the conflicts of the previous months had exacerbated that. 
""Those progressive guys and girls just think they're pioneers of democracy, advocators of human rights,"" he says. ""They're trying to make it all binary, to make it easy for their low intelligence to understand, so they can take sides and show off how righteous they are. 
""For me, it's brainwashed versus brainwashed. But Chinese students here can't win the propaganda war. No one will listen to them."" 
In February, the College Republicans hosted yet another event on the Uygur detention camps, but it encountered no opposition. The same week, a white student was photographed in a mocking pose with a painting depicting police violence against unarmed African-Americans, and the cycle started anew: bias reports were filed, social media clashes ensued, a community dia­logue was held, and the school admini­stration and student government were accused of not responding adequately. 
Dean Burns says he never saw a need for the administration to intervene in any of the China-related controversies. ""As diffi­cult as those conversations were, there were no [conduct] violations in any of it,"" he says. ""That's kind of what you're supposed to be doing in college, figuring out how to have these conversations."" 
On the possibility of more nefarious contact between students and Chinese authorities, Burns says there haven't been any investigations that he knows of. ""But it's in the open - the CSSA is associated with the Chinese consulate,"" he says. ""It's even fairly widely known that we've got members of the Chinese Communist Party among our students, or their family members. That is what it is. China is China. We're either going to do educational business with them or we're not."" 
He notes that problems associated with having nearly one-fifth of the university's student body from China are emerging, but they aren't political. By late February, the coronavirus had been tearing through China for two months and was working its way into the US, creating logistical and emotional challenges for the university's Chinese students. Like many around the world, some began to report discrimination related to the out­break. In the university's tunnels, someone painted, ""Xenophobia is the real virus here."" 
But it affected some students in more abstract ways. Xu mentions Li Wenliang - the Wuhan doctor threatened by police after warning of the outbreak early on, and who died from the disease. Li became a national hero, with online praise of his whistle-blowing becoming one of the most widespread rebukes of Chinese authorities in years. The incident left an impression on Xu, and he strikes a slightly different tone from the one he did a few months earlier. 
""People realised media and speech freedom are so important; that it can affect everybody's life,"" he says. ""We may have some institutional change after coronavirus [...] I think if we had freedom of press, Dr Li would have [had] more voice."" 
In early March, the coronavirus out­break forced the university to close its campus and initiate online classes, a near universal experience for American colleges that left many wondering if their Chinese student populations would ever recover. One of the last murals painted in the university tunnels before the campus closed was one memorialising Li. It was drawn by Kim, along with several students from mainland China and Taiwan. 
""My opinion changes very often,"" Xu says, with a chuckle. ""But I think it changes based on facts.""

67,/content/Bias_Incident_Lexis_1.DOCX,States News Service,2020-10-09,839 words,,States News Service,,ADL REPORT: ANTI-ASIAN HOSTILITY SPIKES ON TWITTER AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S COVID DIAGNOSIS,False,"The following information was released by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL):
ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today issued a new study showing a dramatic spike in anti-Asian sentiment and conspiracy theories about the spread of coronavirus in conversations on Twitter in the days immediately following the president's first tweet about his positive diagnosis on October 2.
The new study of Twitter conversations and activity, conducted by ADL's Center for Technology and Society, found that in the 12 hours after the president's initial tweet about his and the first lady's COVID-19 diagnosis, there was an 85 percent increase in anti-Asian language and conspiracy theories tracked on the platform. Similarly, the rate of discussions about various conspiracy theories increased 41 percent, with some of those conversations also taking on antisemitic overtones. From October 2-5, the percentage of anti-Asian language on Twitter remained higher than usual.
ADL unveiled the new findings this morning in a virtual press conference hosted by Congresswoman Judy Chu (CA-27), Chairwoman of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus. Also joining were Reps. Grace Meng (NY-06) and Brad Schneider (IL-10), and John Yang, President and Executive Director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice (AAJC).
""The level of hatred and vitriol that was aimed at Asian Americans and Chinese people on social media is simply staggering,"" said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO. ""The hate speech and stereotyping are irresponsible and can spillover into real world violence. With the alarming increase in physical attacks and hate crimes against Asian Americans in recent months, it is clear that all leaders, including our president, need to stop blaming others for spreading the virus.""
The data was gathered with the ADL Online Hate Index (OHI), a new tool that uses state of the art technologies such as machine learning to investigate the prevalence of hate speech on social media platforms. This language was also analyzed with help from tools developed by The Alan Turing Institute.
ADL also found that one of the most common beliefs expressed by conspiracy theories was that a ""New World Order"" or ""NWO"" would be implemented supposedly run by secretive actors who either gave President Trump the virus or plan to assassinate him under cover of his illness. Other common online conspiracy theories suggest the virus is a bioweapon created by the Chinese government, that Bill Gates caused the virus, and that the virus was ""engineered"" by humans.
These Twitter discussions also mention elements of the QAnon conspiracy theories, calling on ""patriqts"" deliberately misspelled to signal fellow believers in Q, to rescue the president. Some tweets made antisemitic claims such as President Trump is a ""crypto Jew"" or a ""Zionist agent,"" or that he is a pawn caught up in the machinations of Jewish interests.
""Misinformation and xenophobia are dangerous. That is why the CDC and WHO have both warned not to associate COVID-19 with a specific people or country because of the stigma it causes. And now, thanks to the ADL's report, we are able to see that harmful impact in real time,"" said Rep. Judy Chu. ""As the ADL's report shows, the alarming anti-Asian hate incidents we have witnessed in recent months are not an accident. They are the result of an atmosphere of xenophobia and bigotry that is thriving on Twitter and other online platforms.""
The findings are based on an analysis of more than 2.7 million tweets between 8 p.m. UTC on Oct. 2 through 9 p.m. UTC on Oct. 5. Some of the tweets analyzed harkened back to remarks made by the president on September 29 in the first presidential debate, when he suggested that the pandemic was ""China's fault,"" and referred to the virus as the ""China plague,"" the latest in a pattern of inflammatory remarks over many months.
Global anxiety about the outbreak of the coronavirus has spawned misinformation and scapegoating. Since the spread of the virus in the U.S., there has been a surge of incidents of bias, harassment, and violence against Asian Americans, immigrants, and Orthodox Jewish communities.
Building on ADL's century of experience working toward a world without hate, the Center for Technology and Society (CTS) serves as a resource to tech platforms and develops proactive solutions to fight hate both online and offline. CTS works at the intersection of technology and civil rights through education, research and advocacy.
ADL is the world's leading anti-hate organization. Founded in 1913 in response to an escalating climate of anti-Semitism and bigotry, its timeless mission is to protect the Jewish people and to secure justice and fair treatment for all. Today, ADL continues to fight all forms of hate with the same vigor and passion. A global leader in exposing extremism, delivering anti-bias education, and fighting hate online, ADL is the first call when acts of anti-Semitism occur. ADL's ultimate goal is a world in which no group or individual suffers from bias, discrimination or hate.",Bias Incident

Singh, manager of senior policy and advocacy at the Sikh Coalition, New York, and Raman Dhillon, CEO of the North American Punjabi Trucking Association, Fresno, California, have issued a public comment on the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration proposed rule entitled ""Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs"". The comment was written on Nov. 9, 2020, and posted on Nov. 12, 2020:
* * *
INTRODUCTION
The Sikh Coalition and the North American Punjabi Trucking Association (""NAPTA"") jointly submit these comments in response to the Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs, the notice published by the Department of Health and Human Services (""HHS""), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (""SAMHSA"" or ""Agency""), soliciting comments in Docket No. SAMHSA-2020-000 regarding the Agency's notification of mandatory guidelines.
By way of introduction, the Sikh Coalition is the nation's largest Sikh American legal and civil rights organization. The Sikh Coalition owes its existence in large part to the effort to combat bias against Sikh-Americans after September 11, 2001, including hate crimes, police profiling, employment discrimination, and other forms of discrimination. For over a decade, Sikhs in commercial trucking, medical, information technology, and other industries have contacted our organization for legal assistance requesting religious accommodations to employment-based hair testing. In addition, Sikh commercial truck drivers have contacted our organization for legal help in relation to bias incidents and hate crimes, including assaults.
NAPTA is an organization advocating to improve business and safety standards for all of its members. NAPTA's more than 1,100 members represent a number of diverse religious communities within the South Asian diaspora, including Sikhs. At present, Sikhs represent tens of thousands of drivers within the trucking industry. In 2018, a report cited that 30,000 Sikh American drivers had entered the industry within the last two years alone./1
The Sikh Coalition and NAPTA appreciate the safety concerns that the proposed policy seeks to address; indeed, NAPTA has a vested interest in ensuring that America's roads remain safe for commercial drivers. Notwithstanding, our organizations remain concerned about privacy as it relates to hair testing, and impacts on equal employment opportunity for federal employees, federal contractors and other individuals subject to the proposed regulations including, but not limited to, commercial drivers. These equal employment opportunity concerns include both 1) the disparate impact that false positives may have Punjabis, South Asians and Sikhs who overwhelmingly have brown or black hair, and 2) ramifications of faith-based exemption requests to hair testing by observant Sikhs who maintain unshorn hair. For these reasons, our organizations unequivocally do not support hair testing in the governmental or private sector.
ABOUT SIKHS, SIKHISM & UNSHORN HAIR
Observant Sikhs are currently employed in federal workplaces such as the U.S. Military, Federal Bureau of Investigations, Secret Service, Customs Border Protection, Department of Justice, among many others. They are also integral parts of the private sector, working as government contractors, and in federally regulated industries in which drug testing is an employment requirement. For example, Sikhs represent a disproportionately large demographic/2 of the federally regulated commercial trucking industry./3
Virtually every job Sikhs and other religious minorities participate in could be impacted as a result of drug hair testing policies and procedures.
Sikhism is the fifth largest world religion, with over 25 million followers. Sikhism was founded in Punjab, India in 1469 by Guru Nanak, who rejected the caste system and declared all human beings equal. The Sikh religion is monotheistic, believing in one God that is all eternal, all-pervading, and all equal. It is estimated that approximately half a million Sikhs reside within the United States.
Observant Sikhs are required to wear a religious uniform consisting of a dastaar (turban) and articles of faith, including but not limited to kesh (uncut hair, including an unshorn beard). Sikhs wear these articles of faith as part of their external uniform to unify and bind them to the beliefs of the religion and to remind them of their commitment to Sikh teachings at all times. The articles of faith distinguish a Sikh and have deep spiritual significance. For example, a Sikh turban is not simply a piece of cloth, but rather a commitment to upholding freedom, justice, and dignity for all people. The dastaar can be worn by both men and women.
Maintaining unshorn kesh is one of the primary means through which most Sikhs practice their faith. This religious mandate includes not only hair on the head, but all body hair for men and women. Maintaining kesh unshorn is rooted in the Sikh belief that hair is a divine gift; thus, maintaining it unshorn is considered living in harmony with the will of God. The Sikh religious code of conduct (the Rehat Maryada) explicitly forbids the removal or cutting of any hair, and doing so weakens a Sikh's connection to God and to the Sikh religious community. In short, maintaining uncut hair is an essential part of the Sikh way of life.
Uncut hair and turbans historically have been central features of the Sikh identity. In the 18th century, Sikhs in South Asia were persecuted and subject to forcible conversion. The method of conversion was to remove a Sikh's turban and cut off his hair. Since then, denying a Sikh the right to wear a turban and maintain unshorn hair has symbolized denying that person the right to belong to the Sikh faith; it is perceived by adherents as the most humiliating and hurtful physical injury that can be inflicted upon a Sikh.
RACE & ETHNICITY-BASED DISPARATE IMPACT OF HAIR TESTING
The Sikh Coalition and NAPTA understand that the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (""FAST"") Act mandated that HHS promulgate scientific and technical guidance for hair-based drug testing for the transportation industry, and that private employers across a variety sectors routinely use hair-based drug testing to ostensibly advance safety in their industries. Notwithstanding, neither organization supports the use of hair for drug testing given privacy and equal employment opportunity concerns.
As the agency discussed at its proposed guidelines (see sec. CITE), black and brown hair submitted for testing is subject to a higher rate of false positives. This translates to real adverse employment action towards the unfortunate employees who submitted the samples, as evidenced by the Jones case./4
Sikhs, Punjabis, and other South Asians, typically have brown or black hair, and are already disproportionately subject to high rates of bias such as employment discrimination and hate crimes. For example, the FBI's most recent hate crime statistics indicate that Sikhs were the third most targeted faith group in 2018 and saw an increase of hate crimes of 200% from 2017 to 2018. Our organizations cannot support initiatives that potentially subject our already vulnerable communities to a greater likelihood of discrimination - particularly given that so many Sikhs and South Asians derive their livelihood from commercial trucking, the industry that will foremost be subject to federally regulated hair testing. The harm is unjustifiably high when compared to oral fluids and urine testing, are far more reliable to detect recent drug ingestion and rationally related to workplace safety. Indeed, drug hair testing is unable to detect immediate drug use to keep workplaces and industries safe. Accordingly, we do not agree that hair testing should be added to the matrix of the Federal Workplace Drug Testing Program. Notwithstanding, Congress, through the FAST Act, has mandated the opposite. We thus appreciate any and all safeguards that narrowly tailor usage of hair testing and mitigate false positives and corresponding race and ethnicity-based disparities - despite the higher cost and logistical complexity these safeguards may pose. SAMHSA has outlined several of these safeguards in the proposed regulations, for example:
1) Limiting the use of hair testing to only pre-employment and random collections.
2) Using a two-test method, i.e., collecting and testing an authorized alternate specimen (urine or oral fluids) if a donor cannot explain a positive hair testing result, and notifying the agency of a positive hair test only if this corroborating evidence (i.e., admission of illicit drug use) is obtained.
We agree that the inclusion of these specific safeguards are necessary and request that the Agency take additional actions that minimize false positives in hair testing and/or mitigate the disparate impact on racial and ethnic minorities.
FAITH-BASED EXEMPTIONS TO HAIR TESTING
Consistent with the mandate of the FAST Act, the proposed regulation provides an exemption to hair testing for individuals who cannot provide hair samples for religious reasons. Hair tests pose a grave problem for observant Sikhs given that they are religiously mandated to maintain unshorn hair, i.e., cannot remove or cut any hair on their person. Each year the Sikh Coalition fields inquiries from observant Sikh employees across the transportation, medical, pharmaceutical, technology and other sectors who require assistance obtaining religious accommodations to hair-based drug testing.
In addition, the Sikh Coalition represented three observant Sikh truck drivers who were wrongfully terminated from transportation logistics giant J.B. Hunt for refusing to submit hair samples for drug testing./5
The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission brokered a settlement between the parties in 2016, after a seven-year federal investigation during which it concluded that JB Hunt had, in fact, discriminated against the Sikh truck drivers in violation of federal anti-discrimination law by failing to provide religious accommodations./6
During the course of the investigation, J.B. Hunt revised its written policies and procedures regarding discrimination and religious accommodations, and established an alternative to drug testing by hair sample for those who require religious accommodations.
The Religious Freedom Restoration Act (""RFRA"") compels the faith-based exemption to hair testing articulated in both the FAST Act and proposed regulation. Both Congress and HHS are bound by RFRA, which provides that the
""[g]overnment shall not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion"" unless it ""demonstrates that application of the burden to the person (1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.""
42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000bb-1(a), (b). RFRA's substantial burden prong is ""clearly"" and ""easily"" satisfied when the government directly penalizes religious exercise,/7 as it would if it required observant Sikhs (and other religious minorities who maintain unshorn hair for religious reasons)/8 to cut their hair and submit samples for testing.
For example, if the federal workplace drug testing program did not provide an exemption to hair testing then an observant Sikh individual would be required to cut their hair and provide a hair sample in order to obtain or maintain employment. The government would substantially burden the Sikh's religious exercise by placing the individual in the untenable position of choosing between gainful employment and their sacred religious beliefs. This action would likewise bar the Sikh's ability to obtain gainful employment on the basis of religion, and chill their free exercise rights.
In this hypothetical, the government would clearly violate the individual Sikh's rights under RFRA. While the burden may be ""in furtherance of a compelling government interest"" - namely safety - it is not ""the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling government interest."" This is because more narrowly tailored forms of advancing the government's interest in safety exist, namely, alternative forms of testing (e.g., urine and oral fluids testing).
It is imperative that the proposed regulation include an exemption because employers routinely fail to provide religious accommodations to drug tests. Many managers who make hiring and related employment decisions are simply ignorant of their obligations under federal and state anti-discrimination laws. While employers are generally knowledgeable of their duty not to discriminate on the basis of race or sex, the duty to accommodate religious beliefs or practices/9 is often completely unknown and therefore overlooked by employers.
Even when employers are aware of their obligations under anti-discrimination law, the standard under Title VII (and analogous state law) is fairly weak and thus often ignored. Employers must provide religious accommodations absent ""undue hardship,"" which the Supreme Court has defined as a ""minimal cost or burden."" It is too easy for employers to argue that perceived safety risks trump any duty to accommodate. Employers have argued that safety is paramount such that they must conduct hair sample testing in addition to DOT-mandated urine testing, and that providing any alternative to hair sample testing is logistically burdensome.
Moreover, employers often fail to accommodate requests for religious accommodation because drug testing (particularly pre-employment) is normally outsourced to third-party laboratories. Third-party techs administering drug testing often fail to recognize that they are acting as agents of the employer, and are normally untrained to respond to requests for religious accommodation.
Notwithstanding, we do not believe that RFRA's strict mandate ends simply with the creation of the exemption to hair testing. Religious minorities like Sikhs may still be subject to adverse employment actions and possible disparate impact discrimination given that the proposed regulation provides only cursory information about faith-based exemptions. We also have good reason to worry that federal agencies and private employers may make adverse inferences or take adverse employment action when individuals assert their religious right to refuse hair testing for faith-based reasons. Agencies and employers could subject applicants/employees to direct retaliation or view them as ""less safe"" choices for failing to provide hair samples - resulting in failures to hire or termination.
The Agency must provide more specific guidance of implementation of the faith-based exemption to comply with RFRA's requirement that the government use the least restrictive means to further its compelling governmental interest. Specifically, the Agency should provide the following:
1) Detailed guidance around how third-party laboratories communicate faith-based refusals to test to federal agencies in and outside of the Federal CCF form so that those refusals are not mistakenly communicated or misclassified as general refusals to test. (In addition, creation of a record is imperative in the event of employment discrimination or RFRA-based legal challenge.)
2) Guidance that ensures neither regulating federal agencies nor private employers can make adverse inferences or take adverse employment actions simply because individuals assert their religious (or medical or other legal) right to accommodation in the form of an alternate testing method -- whether in direct retaliation or because those applicants/employees are viewed as ""less safe"" choices for not providing a hair sample.
3) Training and instruction of collectors, MROs, and certified laboratories that specifically addresses faith-based objections and the diverse religious populations which may request them, RFRA, employment discrimination law, and equal employment opportunity best practices vis a vis hair testing refusals for religious (and medical) reasons.
4) Certification and recertification of laboratories should depend, in part, upon their appropriate classification, communication and handling of religious (and medical) accommodation requests to hair testing.
ACCOMMODATION OF RELIGIOUS HEADWEAR/ATTIRE
RFRA mandates that the Agency clarify Section 8.3(d) of the proposed regulation to ensure that collectors provide faith-based exemptions to the request that donors remove any unnecessary outer garments such as a coat or jacket and any hat or hood. Specifically, the proposed regulation should provide for an exemption for religious headwear, religious clothing and related articles of faith. Moreover, consistent with RFRA's mandate the agency should provide analogous training to collectors to ensure that they do not mandate that donors remove religious attire during collection.
As detailed earlier, the Sikh Coalition represented three observant Sikhs who were terminated by JB Hunt for refusing to provide hair samples for drug tests. It must be noted that the Coalition additionally represented a fourth client who was terminated by JB Hunt for refusing to remove his religiously-mandated turban - a purported extraneous garment - for a urinalysis drug test. For observant Sikhs, mandating that a turban be removed is akin to demanding a strip search - and would force the donor to choose between their job and their faith. In other instances, some individuals may wear a hat but do not want to remove their head covering due to religious observances.
Under the current proposed guidelines, a collector could make the same illegal demand of a Sikh,/10 Muslim, Jew or other donor who wears religious clothing or headwear. As discussed previously, employers and collectors often have limited knowledge and expertise to appropriately respond to faith-based objections to drug testing requirements. Misunderstandings may be compounded if donors are limited English proficient. Thus, the Agency should revise Subpart D to include an explicit exemption to religious (and medical) attire/headwear; in addition, the proposed regulation should provide for specific training for collectors on cultural competency and appropriately responding to these types of faith-based objections.
VAGUENESS IN COLLECTION PROCEDURES WHEN DONOR IS UNABLE TO PROVIDE A HAIR SAMPLE
SAMHSA must also ensure that federal agencies that adopt drug hair testing do not establish collection procedures for alternate specimens or other follow-up procedures that create disparate, adverse, or other discriminatory impacts on religious or racial/ethnic minorities. For example, we believe that section 8.6 of the proposed guidelines is unreasonably vague and provides too much discretion to agencies to promulgate differing procedures for the provision of alternate specimens. There is a distinct lack of standardization within the post-collection procedures, and an expectation that agencies create their own, different procedures for providing alternate specimens. While it is unclear, there appears to be room for federal agencies to create additional and/or onerous screening requirements (such as additional or more frequent drug testing) because a donor has requested a faith-based (or medical or other) exemption to hair testing. We worry that the discretion in such open-ended guidance will allow for discrimination against religious minorities and others who require exemptions to hair testing. As such, the Agency must ensure that donors submitting to hair testing have a clear understanding of the limits to alternate specimen collection procedures established by federal agencies in order to reduce the likelihood of discrimination.
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, the Sikh Coalition and NAPTA appreciates the opportunity to comment on this matter. We do not support the inclusion of drug hair testing in the Federal Workplace Drug Testing Program when urinalysis and oral fluids are far more reliable and reasonable in relation to workplace safety requirements. Hair testing has raised concerns by the Agency that selective drug binding with the wide variation of color pigments distributed amongst the population may introduce bias in drug test results. The proposed incorporation of hair testing creates challenges for racial and religious minorities that are not adequately mitigated with the two-test approach. As such, the Agency must address the concerns we have raised to remain consistent with federal protections on the free exercise of religion and equal employment opportunities. The Sikh Coalition is available to share resources and provide additional information to the Agency in ensuring that Sikhs are afforded the appropriate and necessary accommodations in a non-discriminatory manner.

See Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison, 432 U.S. 63,74, n. 9; Philbrook, 479 U.S. at 67. Courts generally find that documented health and safety objections qualify as a ""de minimus cost or burden"" on an employer in the face of a request for religious accommodation - particularly where the employer provides evidence that the proposed accommodation would either cause or increase safety risks or the risk of legal liability for the employer.

DON LEMON, CNN HOST: I had to check my math more than once because it seemed impossible but it's true. The equivalent of 140 to 9/11.
This virus is killing us, killing us by the thousands and thousands. And the hard truth is, we aren't vaccinating nearly enough people to stop this tragedy. More than 2.7 million Americans have gotten shots in the arm so far. That works out to a daily rate of 53 shots per 100,000 people. But we're getting vaccinated by countries like Israel, with 608 per 100,000. Bahrain with 263, the UK with 60. Our vaccine effort is just not good enough. And Americans are paying the price right now.
Look at the line at this food bank in Austin, Texas this morning, all those people waiting and waiting to get two boxes of food just to feed their families. And those $2,000 stimulus checks that could help them. Bear a casualty of the standoff on Capitol Hill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell making it clear his priority is to placate the President, while doing everything he can to ensure the measure doesn't actually come up for a vote.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): The Senate is not going to split apart the three issues that President Trump linked together.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
LEMON: So, never mind, those desperately needed checks. We'll just tack on the President's grudge match with Twitter and his false claims of voter fraud, false claims of voter fraud. And we'll just let the bill die. And what is the President doing? What is he doing? Well, Americans are suffering.
There, there you go. Right there. Exactly what you knew he'd be doing and that is golfing, spending his 313th day at one of his golf clubs since he took office. Trump supporters how do you justify that? Republican lawmakers how do you justify that? Come on. While he is playing his allies are hard at work, the Senate Senator Josh Hawley announcing he is going to object to the electoral college results next week, signing on to the President's doomed last ditch attempt to at a coup really. It's nothing but a big dumb show. That's all it is a big reality TV show for all of them. They think it's a game because again, no game. Big reality TV show for an audience of one at the White House or on a golf course I should say.
The proof we're learning tonight the current President is returning to Washington. He's going to do it early. Which means he'll be in town for that big dumb show. Trump now expected to leave Palm Beach before his annual New Year's Eve party, even though guests had already gathered at Mar-a-Lago and were told Trump would be partying with them, partying. That's according to three sources. Looks like he can't resist passing up a ritzy party filled with sycophants for is even bigger show.
Conservative lawyer George Conway, former White House counselor, Kellyanne Conway's husband, outraged tonight, by the game playing on Capitol Hill. And warning, it is very dangerous to our democracy.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GEORGE CONWAY, CONSERVATIVE LAWYER: What we're seeing here is a never ending downward spiral into delusion and unreality and into just lies about the integrity of our democracy. And that is profoundly dangerous. These individuals are seeking to advance their own political careers. And do so at the at the expense of trust in our democracy. They're fomenting these lies fomenting these fears of an illegitimate election, and they're doing so for their own political benefit. And it's destructive of democracy. It's horrible. And nobody's ever done this before.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
LEMON: All right. So it's obvious right? That it's Senator Hawley's motives are pretty transparent. He's perfectly willing to ride the President's Crazy Train all the way to the end of the line. If it means he can appeal to loyal Trump fans, positioning himself for a White House run. Good luck with that.
But the fact is, all these people think that they can go on Fox News and all of a sudden that they're like, famous or whatever, come on, people. But really. The fact is, for all this President's rantings and ravings about voter fraud, he and his team of clowns have turned up absolutely nothing. nada, zilch, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing. Again and again and again. It's just -- it's maddening.
[22:05:02]
Members of the President's own party, the White House insiders, the courts, they've all said it is over. There was no fraud that Joe Biden won. So let's remember this, OK. This president's handpick now former Attorney General, said that there was no evidence of fraud that would have changed the election results. Refuse the President's or loser demands for special counsel.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAM BARR, FMR ATTORNEY GENERAL: If I thought a special counsel at this stage was the right tool, and was appropriate I would do I would name one, but I haven't and I'm not going to.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
LEMON: So Mitch McConnell waited six weeks but finally acknowledged, Biden's win.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MCCONNELL: The Electoral College has spoken. So today, I want to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
LEMON: The Supreme Court throughout election cases twice, twice in one week. The agencies charged with protecting our election called it the most secure in American history. Judges all across this country have thrown out cases, case after case after case. A Trump appointed federal appeals court judge throwing out a case in Pennsylvania writing this, charges requires specific allegations and then proof. We have neither here. Calling an election unfair does not make it so. Wow. Logic. It's crazy.
Well, this is a president who piled crazy on top of crazy, on top of crazy, on top of crazy. If you got the first three years of his term were bad. This year, really took the cake reach new lows, a defeated, impeached, one term President still refusing to admit that he's a loser. That he lost. Still pretending that he can just tweet away his loss to Joe Biden. And with 2020, just about in the rearview mirror, let's look back at some of the best of the worst moments of the insane reality show of the final year of this President's disastrous term. I should say that in all of the insane people who are part of the Insane Clown Posse. Because there were so many of them, we actually need reminding, reminding. This is a president who is whose dereliction of duty left Americans unprotected from a deadly pandemic.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP (R) PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES: When you have 15 people, and the 15, within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero. That's a pretty good job.
We've done every one of these doctors that have you know so much about this. Maybe I have a natural ability, maybe I shouldn't have done that instead of running for president.
I said, supposing you brought the light inside the body you can which you can do either through the skin or in some other way. And I think you said you're going to test that too. Sounds interesting.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE).
TRUMP: Right? And then I see the disinfectant but knocks it out in a minute, one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or, or almost a cleaning because you see it gets in the lungs?
So I said to my people slow the testing down, please.
They are dying. That's true. And you have -- it is what it is.
That's all I had turned on television, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID. A plane goes down. Five hundred people that they don't talk about it. COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID. By the way, on November 4, you won't hear about it anyway.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
LEMON: Hindsight is 2020. Right? 2020 minutes. Think all that you just heard that was rearview mirror in liquid turned up? Nothing. That one thing he said there was accurate. Not one thing. Not one thing. Trump supporters, whether you're watching now you're going to see this on spread on social media online. Just looking at the tape, not one thing. You got 15 people soon it's going to be over that going to talk about it after November 4. You could inject it. They said no, that's not what he said. That's what he said. Play the sound bite. None of it was accurate. None of it was intelligent. Just dumb, making up stuff. So he can pull a grift con you. Did you fall for it? This is a president who had peaceful protesters gassed. So he could hold up -- hold a photoshoot up and shoot whatever on the steps of a church.
(voice-over): There it is Bible. I don't know. Maybe upside down? Who knows? Brand new.
[22:10:02]
President who, on the debate stage refused to condemn the far right wing proud boys.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: What do you want to call them? Give me a name, give me a name --
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: White supremacist and white --
(CROSSTALK)
TRUMP: Proud boys, stand back and stand by.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
LEMON: A president who refuse to commit to a peaceful transfer of power.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Will you commit to making sure that there is a peaceful transfer of power after the election. TRUMP: Go and have to see what happens. Get rid of the ballots, and you'll have a very transfer -- have a very peaceful, there won't be transferred. Frankly, there'll be a continuation.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
LEMON: Get rid of the ballots. Now, that sounds like election fraud, because that's what it is. Projection. Who's committing the fraud, or trying to?
A president who on election night wanted ballots to go uncounted and insisted against all the facts and evidence that he'd won.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: We want all voting to stop. We don't want them to find any ballots at 4:00 in the morning and add them to the list. OK. It's a very sad, it's a very sad moment. To me, there's a very sad moment. And we will win this. And as far as I'm concerned, we already have one.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
LEMON: Done, yes, you won. Believe -- keep believing that? Yes. See the moving trucks outside of the house and what are you going to do? Got to go.
President who defended his mental fitness to hold office by praising his own ability to recall five words.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: So it's person, woman, man, camera, TV. OK, that's very good. If you get it in order, you get extra points. If you're -- OK, they're always asking you other questions. Other questions? And then 10 minutes, 15, 20 minutes later say, remember the first question, not the first but the 10th question. Give us that again. Can you do that again, and you go person, woman, man, camera TV. If you get it in order, you get extra points. He said, nobody gets in an order. But then when you go back about 20, 25 minutes later, and they say go back to that, but they don't tell you this. Go back to that question. And repeat them. Can you do it and you go, person, woman, man, camera TV. They say? That's amazing. How did you do that? I do because I have like, a good memory because I'm cognitively there.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
LEMON: So cringey. Now that would be Netflix. There you go. That's a great comedy. You could imagine all the program you could have with just that. Yes, cognitively there. What a year. It is my last show of the -- of this year for what I'm doing now. No, we'll see you on New Year's Eve. But seriously, there's a lot of terrible things happening but what a year. Think about what this man has done in the last year since we've been in this pandemic. What a presidency the last four years. What a presidency. One that ends in just 21 days. We'll talk about all the rest after the break.
[22:17:01]
LEMON: So, the coronavirus pandemic is spiraling out of control in this country. Tonight more than 125,000 Americans are hospitalized with a virus that's unfortunately a new record. The CDC is now predicting another 82,000 COVID deaths in just the next few weeks. So I want you to keep in mind, we've already lost more than 342,000 people since the pandemic began. And we are learning that the new highly contagious COVID variant has been identified in California and in Colorado.
So let's go to Colorado right now and talk to (INAUDIBLE) Democratic Governor Jared Polis. Good evening, sir. Good to see you. How are you and your and your husband doing since this? Because you both get down with it right.
GOV. JARED POLIS (D-CO): Thanks, Don. Yes, we're fully recovered. I had an easier time of it. Marlon spent two nights in the hospital but we're all fully recovered. We have the blessing of health. And like everybody, I think we're all ready to move on to the next year. But 2020 still wants to leave us with a new potentially more contagious variant.
LEMON: And that's what I want to talk to you about. So I'm glad we got that out of the way because I know you're now you're looking to protect the people so that they don't end up getting the virus if it, you know, if it can be prevented. So, this new coronavirus variant in your state is even more contagious. How are you going to handle a potential surge? Because hot surge because hospitals already packed haven't even seen the Christmas bike yet, Governor?
POLIS: Well, look, this very unlikely exists in many states, particularly states that had a lot of travel with England, like in Mid-Atlantic New England region. Colorado, scientists were the first to find the variant in somebody in Colorado. We know it's not widespread yet here, because we've looked through a number of different RNA sets. And this is the only case we found. But what happened in England, Don is because this variant appears to be more contagious and essentially overtook the other variants of the virus and became the predominant strain in southwest England.
And so, that's what we're, you know, any it's all contagious on any version is viruses contagious. So, it's really the same precautions, avoid socializing with people outside your home, wear a mask, keep six feet from others.
LEMON: So, Governor, Colorado isn't getting all the vaccine doses that you were promised. What's your reaction to President Trump blaming you, your fellow governors for the lagging distribution?
POLIS: Well, what if you give us more we're happy to distribute more. We set down the rule in Colorado, every provider hospital Community Health Clinic we work with has to use and deploy into folks arms within 72 hours every day we give them when we reassign it to someone who will. So yes, we're ready to deploy more. Go please send it, we're ready to go.
LEMON: The most important thing you need from the incoming Biden administration to help you handle this worsening crisis,
POLIS: I would say the proper use of the soapbox rather than a president that disregards public health advice, a president who encouraged our fellow Americans to save lives by wearing a mask and avoiding socializing with others outside your household. And of course, we'd love assistance with continued work around vaccine delivery and assistance for the states to successfully continue our testing programs and our vaccination programs.
[22:20:18]
LEMON: So, the people in your state as I understand infected with this COVID strain. Our National Guard members who were helping at a nursing home. Should -- Governor should service members assisting with the COVID crisis be a priority for vaccines?
POLIS: Absolutely. I think I speak for all the governors when I express intense appreciation for the work of our guardsmen and guards, women. I mean, they've done an amazing job standing up testing centers, logistical support. In Colorado, we even had our three largest wildfires in the history of our state this summer, the guardsmen helped with evacuations and other work supporting the firemen and first responders. So, they're -- we're very grateful for the work that they do every day. And yes, it was a member of the National Guard that had that first case of that variant.
To be clear, the variant is not more dangerous to one's health. It is what everything we know about it from the UK, same hospitalization rates and fatality rates. It is more contagious wishes if it spreads, the more people could lead to more hospitalizations and deaths.
LEMON: I've got to get your take on what's happening in Washington with this the stimulus drama that's going on right now. Leader McConnell was basically he's basically closed the door for increasing checks to $2,000. What does this mean for all the people who are struggling all over the country, but in your state, you're the governor of Colorado, what does this mean for folks?
POLIS: It's a great shame. I hope they find a way and if they want to, you know, narrow the group a little do it for anybody who lost employment or lost income, and last year, that's fine, get the price tag down compromise. That's what we do come up with something. So we can get out that $2,000 for the people who need it the most, the people who cut their hours, lost their jobs, the $600, which is arriving soon as appreciated, of course, it helps our state did $375 on top of that, but there's a lot of folks across the entire country that can really use that help right now. And I really call upon Mitch McConnell to seek a compromise with his Republican and Democratic colleagues.
LEMON: We know it's a very busy time, and you're dealing with the folks in your state and trying to handle the business of the people in your state. So we appreciate you joining taking the time to join us. Thank you so much. Happy New Year to you.
POLIS: Always a pleasure, Don, happy New Year.
LEMON: The President has lost every argument so far. He's proved -- he's provided no proof for anything. But he just won't stop shouting fraud, and it is dividing his own party.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look, the one thing you learn now is, loyalty is one way with President Trump. You know if you have these leaders that have done a lot for Donald Trump, and they don't follow through on this, then he'll throw him under the bus.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
[22:26:18]
LEMON: So, President Trump getting some help with his latest bogus attempt to overturn the election that he lost fair and square for considered Josh Hawley says that he'll challenge the President's re- election results next week in Congress. But contrary to what the President may tweet. The stop won't prevent Joe Biden from becoming the next president on January 20th.
So, joining me now CNN's White House correspondent Mr. John Harwood, and former adviser to George W. Bush and John McCain is Mark McKinnon. Thank you, sir. He's such gentlemen. Tipping your hat. Good to see you.
John, no tip of the hat. What do you -- no, oh. Well, next time?
JOHN HARWOOD, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: I got no hat.
LEMON: I know, I looked at this screen -- monitor. You don't have it. So let's get to it. So, we're hearing the President Trump John is changing his travel plans because of this last ditch effort to overturn the election results? What do you know about it?
HARWOOD: Look, President Trump is pretty badly wounded right now. He's lost the election. That was a huge blow to him psychologically. He is having difficulty accepting that. So he's holding on to this delusion that he can somehow with the complicity of Republican politicians overturn the results of the election. Can't feel good for him to be having been embarrassed by Joe Biden the election to host that New Year's Eve party. So he's not going to his New Year's Eve party. He's not even happy about the renovations that Melania Trump has overseen to Mar-a-Lago. So, he's getting out of town. White House hasn't officially announced that he could change his mind. But we believe our reporting tells us that he's going to come back tomorrow and try to see what he can get going heading into January 6, when the Electoral College results are going to be certified. That's not in doubt. But the only question is how much of a ruckus and a circus can be kicked up before that happens? LEMON: I got to ask you, because I just getting I just got some stuff regarding another appeal possible appeal to the Supreme Court here. What is it? What are you hearing about that another appeal to Supreme Court this time about Wisconsin's election results contesting trying to get them to overturn Wisconsin's result?
HARWOOD: This is crazy stuff. It's not going anywhere Supreme Court said what they're going to say about this election. They can keep throwing out pieces of paper and challenge different states. But you can tell the way some of the crazier Trump advocates Linwood, the attorney in Georgia is wildly attacking John Roberts, the chief justice and Supreme Court. You can tell that they understand what the what the odds are against them with the Supreme Court, this thing is now going to the Congress on January the 6th, Trump is going to lose again.
Mike Pence is either going to perform that ministerial duty of certifying those results or somebody else will. And Donald Trump's going to leave in three weeks, but he's going to be doing a lot of yelling and kicking and screaming between now and then.
LEMON: Mark what is -- what was Trump's obsession, his supporter's obsession and not just the lawmakers? What's your obsession with using the courts to get to end to be so aggrieved and what is this? I've never seen anything like it --
MARK MCKINNON, FMR ADVISER TO GEORGE W. BUSH & JOHN MCCAIN: Well, it's likely. Well Don, one of the things that -- is first of all, he can't accept losing. It's just not in a psychology. So, he thinks he was robbed and he's thought all along with that the courts all over men including and especially the Supreme Court, are supposed to bend to his political will. He thought that the reason that he got to a point all these people is that they would do what he wanted to under any circumstances. And they didn't have to actually look at the law. They just had to look at Donald Trump and see what he wanted to do, see which way the wind would blow, and that they would respond to genuflect and they didn't.
[22:30:19]
And, you know, to their credit, as I've said before, you know, a lot of Democrats don't like the idea of the Federalist Society, but at least they appointed experienced judges, if they hadn't been there given Donald Trump a list, we'd have Mayor Giuliani and, you know, others on the Supreme Court who would do job Trump's doing a bidding on these court actions to change overturn an election, a poorly held election. So, it really just down it's just a reflection of the notion that he thinks that the court should bend to his will.
LEMON: It's really I mean, when they -- it's really projection in Mark when they talk about snowflakes. Who are the real snowflakes, and all of this? They are the real snowflakes. Because there's so agree they're so put upon it's oh my gosh, I'm so heard of so -- it's really a weird, weird thing that that is happening in this country right now.
After Mark after senator Hawley announced that he's going to object during the Electoral College certification. Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger tweeted this. He says, internal monologue. I want to be president. So I decided to try to get POTUS tweets, POTUS tweets saying I'm great, even though I know this isn't going anywhere. But hey, I'll blame someone else when it fails.
Clearly, this spectacle Mark is all about 2024. But I mean, do you expect other Republicans to follow in Senator Hawley's footsteps?
MCKINNON: Oh, I do. Don. And I think that it's clear and I projected well before the election that if Donald Trump lost, he would run immediately or say he was running for President 2024. Because we know from reporting that Donald Trump never thought he was going to be president. He ran because it because if you want media attention, that's the hottest spotlight in the world run for president. Now, if he's not going to be president, and Joe Biden becomes president, which is going to happen, the next best thing is to run for president and to maintain his stranglehold on the Republican Party and maintain a spotlight when he's attacking Joe Biden everyday, which he will. And so, he's going to maintain that political control of the Republican Party.
Now he may ultimately not run in 2024. So anybody else who's interested in it like Josh Hawley should go make sure genuflect before King Donald to make sure they understand that they pass the loyalty tests away. If and when Don, pulls down the flag and hands and hands it over to somebody else hands up a ton of somebody else's Josh Hawley's first in line.
LEMON: Yes, listen, they're not enough people in this, this big international zoom call that we're having something to bring someone else in. That's former Clinton White House press secretary, Joe Lockhart. He's here too. Joe, good to see you. Welcome. Welcome to the party.
So, Vice President Pence --
JOE LOCKHART, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Thank you, thank you.
LEMON: -- will preside over the joint session of Congress next week. Do you think that he'll actually do his job? Or will he do the President's bidding?
LOCKHART: Well, I think he'll do his ceremonial job which is which is only ceremonial which is he'll open the envelope and look at the Oscar say the, you know, the one of the Oscar goes to Joe Biden. That's his only role. Now he may duck out of it because it's politically difficult for him to have someone from the Senate do it. But I think this whole thing is an effort by Donald Trump to delegitimize the presidency of Joe Biden. He's doing everything he can to try to make Joe Biden's job harder. Everything from COVID to, you know, this stuff about voter fraud. And, you know, he just doesn't seem to care. what the consequences of these, you know, of his vindictive, (INAUDIBLE).
LEMON: Yes. Does he think though, it's so transparent. I mean, it makes him -- it makes him look small and petty, Joe and, I mean, it's, he's going out on a bad note, and it's like it I'm embarrassed. I think most people are embarrassed for him, even if he has no shame.
LOCKHART: Well, I think he has a different inner monologue going on, then a lot of the rest of us say --
LEMON: People are laughing at him. Openly laughing at him and mocking him, Joe for this.
LOCKHART: Yes. And there are a lot of people out there who are worshipping him, and that's who he's listening to. You know, he got 74 million votes. You know, he's a classic con man. He doesn't need to con everyone. He just needs to con enough people to get to the next con. And he's done it for the entire administration. Every promise he's made. He didn't build a wall Mexico hasn't paid for. He didn't replace Obamacare, and he didn't deal with COVID. And now we know the vaccine is not getting out. And he's just trying to stay one con ahead.
LEMON: John, Trump clearly views January 6 as a loyalty test for all Republicans, but as we have seen with Georgia's governor, Brian Kemp recently and countless others over the years, it's a one way street for Trump. These people have carried so much water for him. And as soon as you say, one critical word, or you try to stand by the law or do what you're supposed to do, rather than listen to his wackiness, his delusions, he's three turns right on you.
[22:35:28]
HARWOOD: Donald Trump is a an emotional, psychological black hole, he pulls everything in to him. He demands people to do things that ultimately are going to embarrass them, but he's only thinking about what's in it for him. And so, the idea of him sacrificing something to help another person who's been loyal to him, that's not part of his psychological makeup. So yes, Donald Trump goes moment to moment, looking for gratification for himself, and is looking for people who will give it to him. And if they stop giving it to him, he's got no more use for them.
And as a result of that, look at what's happening with Mitch McConnell. Mitch McConnell, deign to recognize reality and say that Joe Biden was the president-elect, Donald Trump is now taking a series of actions from attacking McConnell on Twitter, to this nonsensical 11th hour attempt to get these $2,000 checks. He is doing everything he can to make Mitch McConnell and the Republicans in the Senate look bad. Don't know if that's going to tilt the results of these very, very close runoff elections in Georgia. But because they're very, very close -- very, very close. Just a little bit will help but he's now teed up the framing of the contest. So the Democrats can credibly say, the only reason why you're not getting $2,000 is Mitch McConnell. Mitch McConnell, having struck a deal with Nancy Pelosi and the administration for a $900 billion COVID relief package. Thought he had done what he needed to do to both respond to some degree to the pandemic and take care of the Georgia Senate races. Donald Trump has decided because he's angry at Mitch McConnell to make Mitch McConnell look bad and he's doing it.
LEMON: Well, I mean, look at Bill Barr, what Bill Barr did for him. I mean, he completely spun what was in the Mueller report to help this president. I mean, if we got him out of that hot water, and look what happened.
Mark, I want to play this for you.
MCKINNON: Right.
LEMON: I'm going to get to this the critical race that's happening in Georgia, Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff use an impromptu live interview with Fox News today to make his case. They think they tried to -- they thought they were ambushing him in some way. A pulled a Jedi mind trick and turned it right on and watch this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JON OSSOFF (D-GA) SENATE CANDIDATE: Since we're live on Fox, let me take this opportunity to address directly the Fox audience. We have two United States senators in Georgia, who have blatantly used their offices to enrich themselves. This is beyond partisanship.
We've lost nine rural hospitals in Georgia in 10 years, we can reopen them. We can invest in infrastructure, to build jobs, revitalize our communities, create opportunity, raise the minimum wage so that people doing an honest week's work can not just survive, but can thrive.
I humbly and respectfully request the support of everyone who has tuned in on Fox right now.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
LEMON: And then he went on to talk about it, according to him that Kelly Loeffler was campaigning with a former member of the Ku Klux Klan live on Fox News. They tried to again say, you know, what about your experience with it? And then I was like, oh, that hurt. What do you think of that move, Mark?
MCKINNON: Oh, man, big kudos to Ossoff for going into the lion's den and backing the lines down. I mean, that's kind of out of the playbook of Mayor Pete. And I love this. I love this from a -- you know, just from a political strategist point of view, Joe, I think you would probably agree. There's a lot of, you know, you may not get a lot of boats going into Fox for a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate. But man, you get points across the board from people watching all over, just for having the courage to go in and speak the truth in a very tough audience. And I think that that says a lot about Ossoff and I think is going to help him in the in the final days here.
LEMON: All right, gentlemen, good to have you on. I really do mean it this time that you know, John, I've told you Happy New Year like 25 times. So I keep thinking I'm not going to see you again. Well happy new year to you gentlemen. You take care of be safe out there. OK. Let's hope 2021 is a lot better.
A black teen accused of stealing a woman's phone. But the thing is, he didn't. And now the DEA is investigating.
[22:42:43]
LEMON: I just want you to sit and watch this next story. It's disturbing video shows a confrontation, conversation between a woman and a black family inside an upscale New York City hotel happened on Saturday. The woman falsely accused a 14-year-old black teen of stealing her iPhone but the teen's family and the hotel well they call the end result and assault. In a moment I'm going to speak live with the teen's parents and their lawyer. But first I want to bring in Brynn Gingras tonight and she's going to walk us through the video. The accusations in the investigation. She spoke with the woman at the center of the controversy. Brynn?
BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hey Don. Yes, Harrold, a fame trumpeter and jazz musician using his music to show his outrage about what happened to him and his son in the Arlo Hotel in New York City last weekend. Kat Rodriguez, the teens mother says this is a racial and justice issue and how much more terrifying she says this could have been if her son had been alone. The family says the hotel and its manager could have acted faster to stop what they call an assault.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KAT RODRIGUEZ, MOTHER OF FALSELY ACCUSED TEEN: He empowered that woman to assault my son and is equally to blame for this injustice.
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKERS: That's right, that's right.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Come on Kat.
RODRIGUEZ: He chose to try and prove that he was innocent instead of using his hospitality tools (INAUDIBLE) his side of the story.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GINGRAS: The hotel said it could have done more to deescalate the situation and said in a statement to CNN quote, we're deeply disheartened about the recent incident of baseless accusations prejudice and assault against an innocent guest of Arlo Hotel.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Show me this is my phone.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Show me.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You don't have to explain (INAUDIBE).
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE) that's mine (INAUDIBLE).
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you kidding me? You feel like there's only one iPhone made in the world?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, OK then show me that.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. You get a life over there --
(CROSSTALK)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You better go use fine Find My iPhone. Go do that.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, Find My iPhone is on that iPhone.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, no, you can't No.
(CROSSTALK)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't care. This is my son.
(CROSSTALK)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm trying to help.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, but you're not helping. Men, I am disrespectful.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, I'm trying to set up (INAUDIBLE).
(END VIDEOTAPE)
GINGRAS: A CNN was the first to speak to this woman seen on the now viral cell phone video accusing the teenager of stealing her cell phone. And then the 20 minute phone interview, she denies attacking anyone and make claims that she was assaulted herself an accusation the family denies.
[22:45:04]
The 22-year-old woman also told me before the incident with the Harrolds, she confronted someone else and insisted they quote empty their pockets. She claims she also demanded the hotel show her the security video. The Harrolds, their attorney and Reverend Al Sharpton planned to meet with the Manhattan district attorney who is investigating the case. And the family demands that charges be filed. The NYPD says as of now the case is not being looked at as a bias incident and detectives are working to speak with the woman.
A top NYPD brass as they are considering this crime as a possible assault or grand larceny or attempted robbery. And when I asked the woman the possibility of facing charges how she feels about that, she said quote, that's not who I am. I actually tried very hard to make sure that I'm always doing the right thing. Now, it is important to note Don that when I spoke to her she did speak at times a radically but she did say she was willing to talk to the family about what happened. Don.
LEMON: We'll see. Thank you, Brynn. I appreciate that.
With me now as Keyon Harrold to -- excuse me Keyon Harold Jr.'s parents, Keyon Sr. and Kat Rodriguez. Also their lawyer, civil rights attorney, Benjamin Crump.
Thank you guys for doing this. I'm so sorry that this happened to your son. 14 years old, 14 years old. How are you doing? How is he doing?
RODRIGUEZ: We were very, we're very hurt. We are disappointed. He is he traumatized and confused about why this happened to him. And speechless sometimes like --
KEYON HARROLD, FATHER OF FALSELY ACCUSED TEEN: We're trying to make sense of it, because it should never happen. From which I, I tried to. I literally tried every form of communication to get to them, you know. I let him know that this is not your phone is not your property. You know, I tried to literally walk away, I tried everything, but it was, you know, just relentless. Unfortunately --
LEMON: What was going through your head because, you know, this happens to not the exact same thing, but similar situations, to people of color all the time? And people don't understand why didn't you just show me for one? Why do I have to show you my phone because you have an issue. I don't have an issue. What was the entitlement of it all? What were you thinking as this was happening Keyon?
HARROLD: What I was thinking was, it's the same thing has been going on for centuries. Just the idea of Show me your papers, show me your papers, boy. And that's just not OK. I wanted to stay in a nice place with my son and wanted to just go down and enjoy some lunch. But the idea that someone felt that they had authority over me, over my son, that they can tell him what to do, even though they didn't pay for his property. I look at it like -- you can't just walk up to someone and say, give me your bank account because I lost mine. It's just ridiculous.
LEMON: But the NYPD Keyon says they're not looking at this as a bias incident.
HARROLD: Well, I mean, perspective, I mean, ultimately, perspective. Like I said, the idea the idea of somebody believing somebody else, just because it's not OK. And the idea of the manager, believing. First of all, this person wasn't even a guest. We were guests, and my son was literally just trying to be a kid and was assaulted, and was --
RODRIGEUZ: Tackled.
HARROLD: -- tackled and just the whole nine (ph). I mean --
LEMON: She's saying that she was assaulted yelling that, you know, what do you say to that?
HARROLD: That's unfortunately, you know --
LEMON: Denying your son. That tonight his attack is not saying that she was assaulted.
HARROLD: That's not true. And, I don't have the full video, the hotel has the full video. And I'll just say that my version of the video is probably the very, very, very GGG, PG version of what happened.
LEMON: Well. Ben, I can see you want to get in. What did you want to say?
BENJAMIN CRUMP, FAMILY'S ATTORNEY: Yes, this is racial profiling one on one Don. These Karen's falsely accuse young black people of heinous things that are not true. By the way Don, her phone was returned by the Uber driver to the hotel. So it was a complete false accusation. And the fact that the hotel manager did not condemn the racial profiling, in many ways, became part of it when he said, well give me your phone as if we're guilty until we're proven innocent and that is not acceptable.
[22:50:01]
And the Manhattan district attorney told us today that the video is way worse on the hotel security that she attacked this kid. She tackled him. She scratched and clawed and fought with his father and say, you are not going to leave this hotel until you give me that phone.
LEMON: Well, Keyon, she said she did it to other people too. Is that did you see that Keyon?
HARROLD: I did. She said -- she did it to other people -- when I walk down stairs --
LEMON: (INAUDIBLE) of other people?
RODRIGUEZ: Well, no, well, but no --
HARROLD: I'm trying --
RODRIGUEZ: Sorry.
HARROLD: What the woman --
LEMON: The woman said that she wasn't just your son that she was, you know, she did it to other people as well. So, I don't know if you happen to see that.
RODRIGUEZ: If that's the case, I'm not sure why the hotel and escort or deescalate the situation then.
HARROLD: And that's the problem. The --
RODRIGUEZ: That's ridiculous.
HARROLD: -- we walk downstairs, there was a guy, I'm not going to say what he looked like. But there was a guy who was basically had been told to -- basically empty his bags, empty his pockets. We walked in, but when my son and I came out of the elevator, literally, it was like, she saw blood and she, you know, sank right into him and told him give me that phone. That's, you know, that's my phone. You know, take off the case, you'll see that it's mine. It's like just ridiculous.
LEMON: So Kat, you obviously thought that they should have handled this different the hotel? HARROLD: If she says she was doing it to other guests, and this kind of establishment something's severely wrong with --
RODRIGUEZ: With the hotel.
HARROLD: -- the management with the security. And you know, I mean, it just wasn't OK.
LEMON: Well, let me (INAUDIBLE) about you. Because I think they should know Keyon about you and your family and not, you know, not that this should but about the people who are on your screen right now. Keyon is a prominent jazz musician. Work with some of the biggest names out there (INAUDIBLE), Jay-Z, Beyonce, Mary J. Blige. His wife is just as successful. I don't have to read your resume. Successful black folks. Do you -- were you -- obviously be surprised by this? But was it shocking to you thinking considering what happened? I mean, I don't really know the question to ask you right now.
HARROLD: Don, I'm still in shock. I mean, what these last couple of days and been like, you know, I'm still in shock. Because it's not supposed to happen. You know, as, as black people as black men, we see it happen all the time. And it's and -- the easy, the easy question that people ask is why didn't you just short up your cell phone. But the issue is that if I were a white guy, nobody would be asking me to show my cell phone, people would just believe that, you know, oh, I must have the wrong guy. But with me with my son, oh, that might mine or show me your papers. And the fact that it just really is at the core of dignity (INAUDIBLE) for my son.
LEMON: (INAUDIBLE) I'm sorry.
HARROLD: I want my son to be a home man. I want him to have his dignity. I don't want people to just anytime they get ready, be able to just, you know, shut him down and make him do things he deserves respect as well. And he got nothing from the management or the young lady who basically should have been dealt with by the management if she was a problem. They should have been able to take care of that.
LEMON: Yes. Many times people who say that they're victims aren't the victims. And we know that.
RODRIGUEZ: Right.
LEMON: Listen, Kat, I got to go. I know you want to weigh in, but I have to run it. Obviously, we have a time limit.
RODRIGUEZ: No worries.
LEMON: I know you want to weigh in. Look. So Mike Walker's uses up those are my glasses and you know that yours? Do you really have to give it to them? Or walks up to your car and says you drive in my car? Do you really have to show them proof? That is your car? I mean, where does this stuff? Come on y'all? You know, stop saying, why didn't you show the phone? We don't -- come on. Happy New Year. I hope that's possible. All right. And my regards to your son you guys be well, thanks. We'll be right back.
HARROLD: Thank you Don.
[23:00:00]",Bias Incident
70,/content/Bias_Incident_Lexis_1.DOCX,Newstex Blogs,2020-12-29,4317 words,,,,2020's most defining stories in Syracuse,False,"Dec 29, 2020( The Daily Orange: http://www.dailyorange.com Delivered by Newstex) The Daily Orange is a nonprofit newsroom that receives no funding from Syracuse University. Considerdonating[1]today to support our mission. In a year with a never-ending news cycle, it can be hard to recall the important moments that defined Syracuse in 2020. COVID-19 made its way onto campus and into Onondaga County. Protests expanded on and around Syracuse University's campus to advocate against racial inequality. An SU alumnus was even elected to the White House. Those are the big ones. But what else impacted Syracuse in a year of uncertainty and unrest? The Daily Orange highlighted some of the most important stories of 2020, chronicled by the writers and editors who covered them. Here are our picks. 
http://s3.amazonaws.com/dailyorange/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/28212020/BIDEN-WINS-FINAL.png Nabeeha Anwar | Presentation DirectorSyracuse University alumnus Joe Biden elected as president[2]President-elect Joe Biden is set to become the first SU alumnus to serve as president of the United States. The former vice president's win came four days after Election Day as the country waited for states to count massive volumes of mail-in ballots. Biden eventually prevailed over President Donald Trump with over 300 electoral votes and victories in key battleground states, including Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. Biden's running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), will be the first woman, first Black person and first Asian American to serve as vice president. While Biden graduated from SU's College of Law in 1968, he's still maintained connections with the university and has visited campus several times throughout his political career. He delivered a commencement address to the College of Law in 2006 and 2016. He also served as a keynote speaker at SU's 2009 commencement ceremony. Biden's late son, Beau Biden, who died of brain cancer in May 2015, also graduated from SU's College of Law in 1994 and delivered the college's commencement address in 2011. Maggie Hicks http://s3.amazonaws.com/dailyorange/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11155447/3.10.20_filephotos_ElizabethBillman_APE-15-1.jpghttp://s3.amazonaws.com/dailyorange/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/17214404/EmilySteinberger_PE_Campus_11.jpg Emily Steinberger | Photo EditorCampus shuts down due to COVID-19, twice[3]March 9 was the first true day of spring at SU. Students packed the Quad, throwing footballs and gathering in groups, because a nice day in early March is almost unheard of in Syracuse. A week later, that same Quad would be deserted, the quiet center of a campus evacuated in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. While unprecedented, the news of SU's transition to online classes didn't arrive without warning. After an initial announcement by Chancellor Kent Syverud that SU would transition to online classes until at least March 30, faculty began speculating that SU would soon follow other colleges and move courses online indefinitely. The decision came a few days later. Eight months after that, a near-identical story occurred again as SU's in-person fall semester crumbled in its final stretch. That time, though, the announcement was prompted by ever-increasing case numbers and swelling quarantine totals on campus and across Onondaga County. As for the spring semester, SU has not yet made a final decision on whether it will hold in-person classes. 'We have to be ready to change course depending on the conditions at the time,' Syverud said on Dec. 9[4]. 'Our goal does remain to begin the spring semester on Jan. 25.' Chris Hippensteel http://s3.amazonaws.com/dailyorange/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/28212500/111619_MBBvsSeattle_CoreyHenry_PE_06.jpg Corey Henry | Senior Staff PhotographerMen's basketball coach Jim Boeheim contracts COVID-19[5]COVID-19's grasp on college sports has only strengthened throughout this winter as the virus rages on. At Syracuse, the football team played its full schedule in the fall without any real hiccups, but the men's basketball season got off to quite the rocky start when one of the most famous people in central New York tested positive. Head coach Jim Boeheim, 76, experienced mild symptoms, completed his isolation period at home and coached SU in its season-opener versus Bryant. His positive test foreshadowed how fragile Syracuse's season is. Since Boeheim tested positive, a walk-on was diagnosed with COVID-19 and Buddy Boeheim missed multiple games due to contact tracing. Most recently, SU has had its final two games of 2020 postponed due to COVID-19 protocol after Buffalo players tested positive a day after playing the Orange in the Carrier Dome. Boeheim's view on COVID-19 remains the same as before he contracted the virus: He thinks college basketball should be played through the pandemic with necessary precautions in place. He believes his team is safer with regimented practice schedules, thrice-weekly testing and team doctors on hand than with canceling the 2020-21 season. Danny Emerman http://s3.amazonaws.com/dailyorange/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/28212633/1.23.20_dom.jpg Katie Getman | Senior Staff DesignerAfter almost two dozen reports of hate crimes and bias incidents, 100+ students react[6]Between the final weeks of 2019's fall semester and the beginning of the spring around a two-month span at least 21 hate crimes or bias-related incidents were reported on or near SU's campus. What began as racist graffiti[7] reported on Nov. 7, 2019 within two floors in Day Hall turned into more and more incidents[8]. The incidents sparked student protests at the Barnes Center at The Arch in November 2019 and Crouse-Hinds Hall in the spring from students who demanded change from SU's administration. In between the two sit-ins[9], The D.O. asked more than 100 SU students if they felt safe on campus after winter break and if the university could do more to remedy issues of transparency and safety. In January, students varied in how safe they felt at SU, but many were unsure whether campus-wide change had been made. KJ Edelman http://s3.amazonaws.com/dailyorange/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/28212741/hendricks.jpg Daily Orange File PhotoLarge gathering on Quad becomes national story[10]Less than a week before the start of classes this fall, more than 100 SU students gathered on the Quad, many not wearing masks or practicing social distancing. Department of Public Safety officers, whose Sims Hall headquarters is just feet from the Quad, cleared the area about 45 minutes after the gathering began. SU eventually suspended 23 students in connection to the incident. 'Make no mistake, there was not a single student who gathered on the Quad last night who did not know and understand that it was wrong to do so,' said Mike Haynie, vice chancellor for strategic initiatives and innovation, in an email the day after the gathering. 'Instead, those students knowingly ignored New York State public health law and the provisions of the Syracuse University Stay Safe Pledge.' Michael Sessa http://s3.amazonaws.com/dailyorange/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/28212837/EmmaFolts_ManagingEditor_DOM.jpg Emma Folts | Managing EditorLast Chance for Change organizes to make lasting impact[11]Protests against racism and police brutality erupted across the United States as news of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor's deaths shook the nation in June. Faced again with painful loss and political momentum, organizers in Syracuse rallied in honor of Floyd, Taylor and several others who had died and were part of the local community. The spectrum of both political organization and emotion ranged widely this summer. Syracuse was no exception to this variation and the all-too familiar cases of police brutality. Fifteen local groups, including Last Chance for Change, came together to discuss, plan and protest. Last Chance for Change members marched throughout Syracuse for 40 days. The activists collaborated to present Mayor Ben Walsh with the People's Agenda for Police Reform, a list of demands for police reform Walsh partially agreed to[12] in July. But beyond the hours of chanting and walking, Last Chance for Change organizers devoted time to creating community spaces and events for Syracuse natives. Most protests and public attention for police brutality and racism faded as summer ended, but for many in Syracuse's Black community, the losses and scars remain fresh. Nevertheless, Last Chance for Change's conversation on justice and healing hasn't stopped. Charged with solidarity, the group's organizers are determined to keep the movement and its name in the minds of Syracuse's leaders and community members, they said. Marnie Muñoz http://s3.amazonaws.com/dailyorange/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/28213009/031220_ACC_JordanPhelps_SP_09.jpg Jordan Phelps | Staff PhotographerSyracuse season canceled during ACC tournament, sports cancellationsbegin[13]March 12 will certainly be a date people remember when lookingback on2020. That's when the sports industry halted. But the path to that day when every college conference scrapped all of their winter tournaments and spring seasons started days prior. The College Basketball Invitational and the Ivy League basketball tournaments were both canceled. Syracuse's men's lacrosse game against Rutgers, if it had happened, would've been played without fans in attendance. And everything culminated on March 11 in Greensboro, North Carolina, as Syracuse blew out North Carolina by 28 points in the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament's first round. The bigger picture, though, contained uncertainty about whether there would even be a second round if all those added hand sanitizer stations, extra surface wipe-downs and restricted media protocols could hold off the looming coronavirus threat. They couldn't. Fans flocked to the Greensboro Coliseum on March 11, but by the next afternoon, the ACC tournament had been upended. Hotel pivots and flight adjustments followed for travelers. Canceled tournaments turned into canceled seasons, canceled seasons into canceled offseason workouts. Suddenly, there was no timeline of when sports, collegiate or professional, would return. Andrew Crane http://s3.amazonaws.com/dailyorange/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/28213031/200217_CrouseHinds_CoreyHenry_PE_18_1.jpg Corey Henry | Senior Staff PhotographerSU initially suspends 30 #NotAgainSU organizers during Crouse-Hinds sit-in[14]#NotAgainSU, a movement led by Black students, began occupying Crouse-Hinds Hall on Feb. 17 to further protest the university's response to a series of hate incidents on and near campus. Crouse-Hinds houses the offices of Chancellor Kent Syverud and other university administrators. There were about 50 organizers in the building's lobby when it closed at 9 p.m. At that time, Rob Hradsky, vice president for the student experience, threatened the organizers with interim suspension for violating SU's Code of Student Conduct by remaining inside past closing. About 30 organizers chose to stay inside Crouse-Hinds. As of 12:50 a.m., a DPS officer gave the students letters stating that they were suspended, effective immediately. The movement first held a sit-in at the Barnes Center at The Arch for eight days in November 2019. SU officials did not issue[15] conduct sanctions to the organizers for staying in the facility overnight. Hradsky told an organizer in Crouse-Hinds that the university suspended the rules in that situation. By the morning of Feb. 18, DPS had sealed off Crouse-Hinds, preventing[16] outside food, medicine and resources from entering until the following afternoon. DPS officers at the building's entrances also exhibited hostility[17]to students who wanted to deliver supplies inside. At one point, DPS Deputy Chief John Sardino physically struggled with protesters outside Crouse-Hinds and touched his gun holster. Two days after the start of #NotAgainSU's occupation, Syverud announced that he had lifted[18] the organizer's interim suspensions. SU also misidentified four students who were not[19] at Crouse-Hinds and placed them under interim suspension, prompting accusations of racial profiling[20]. The university rescinded the four conduct charges. Crouse-Hinds reopened Feb. 20. The movement would continue it's occupation for a total of 31 days, becoming one of the longest-running student protests in SU's recent history.

Photo EditorGreek life during COVID-19: No parties, social events at chapter houses[21]SU has been consistently ranked[22] as a top party school[23] by The Princeton Review. During the pandemic, however, fraternity and sorority members at SU returned to campus for a semester devoid of parties and many other social events.Students had to limit gatherings to 25 people and practice social distancing, according to SU's Stay Safe Pledge. Fraternities and sororities also couldn't host registered social events at chapter houses, and access to chapter houses was limited. Prior to the start of the fall semester, members of fraternities and sororities shared their hopes, fears and expectations for what was to come. One student hoped that Greek organizations would learn fromthe Zeta Beta Tau fraternity'ssuspension[24]for allegedly violating public health guidelines at a gathering in April. Another worried that students would still host parties instead of abiding by health guidelines. 'I've heard that a lot of people are very intent on keeping people safe and keeping to themselves, which is very promising to me,' said Adrianne Morales, a member of Delta Delta Delta. 'But at the same time, that doesn't speak for everyone and ultimately, people's actions will speak volumes more than their words.'

Jon Zubieta, a chemistry professor in SU's College of Arts and Sciences, referred to COVID-19 as 'Wuhan Flu' and 'Chinese Communist Party Virus.' While Zubieta did not respond to The D.O.'s request for comment, he later claimed that his use of such language was intended to mock 'PC culture,' and he began working with a free speech group to reinstate himself at SU. Chinese students at SU, some from Wuhan, spoke out against Zubieta's language. Meanwhile, those calling for Zubieta's reinstatement argued that SU's temporary removal of Zubieta was a violation of free speech. 'We will not allow any member of our community to violate the University's commitment to a safe, inclusive and welcoming learning and living environment,' said Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences Karin Ruhlandt and Interim Provost John Liu in a campus-wide email that announced his leave.

The idea for a collective mostly containing former Syracuse athletes stemmed from conversations Tarrant and other founders had following the killings of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd in late spring. Protests over police brutality and systemic racism had started across the country, and Black Oranges' goal was to outline steps for creating change in local communities while fighting for social justice within SU Athletics and the larger university. As of September, Black Oranges had expanded to over 350 members. It's now part of a new task force within SU's athletic departments, one implemented by Salatha Willis, associate athletic director for diversity, culture and climate, after he was hired in July. The collective has also coordinated a social media campaign, conducted a webinar highlighting the importance of voting and organized town halls with #NotAgainSU and DPSChief Bobby Maldonado. 'If we do these movements and we get these things in people's minds to start, to research and to look at themselves and how they can better themselves, it's going to improve their community,' said Monica Belk, a Black Oranges founder. 'It's going to improve the country.'

Cohen, who was arrested in his Ohio home in December, faces charges of rape in the first degree, burglary in the second degree, attempted sexual abuse in the first degree and forcible touching. The Syracuse Police Department, along with DPSand the Onondaga County District Attorney's Office, launched an investigation after DPS responded to an assault complaint from Cohenin August. DPS later found that Cohen was involved in a physical confrontation with another student that may have started when the student learned Cohen had allegedly sexually assaulted two classmates. Several posts also began circulating on social media at the time accusing Cohen and encouraging the university to take action.

Hawkins, a retired UPS employee who currently lives in Syracuse, was the Green Party's nominee for the 2020 presidential election after receiving 210 out of 355 votes on the first ballot in July. Hawkins, a co-founder of the Green Party, was one of the few candidates in his party with the experience to run a large-scale campaign. His presidential run came after 24 campaigns and 24 losses for public office. Apart from co-founding the Green Party in the early 1980s, Hawkins has also protested the Vietnam War and co-founded an organization that opposed nuclear power. Along with his former running mate Angela Walker, he advocated a federal plan to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat economic inequality. More than winning the presidency, the main goal of Hawkins' campaign was to encourage more Green Party candidates to run for local office and to put issues on the public agenda that Democratic and Republican candidates usually ignore. 'There are issues that need real solutions, and the Green Party offers them,' he said. 'It's important to build a party and a movement around those issues and those policies,' Hawkins said.

Jaleel Campbell graduated from SUNY Purchase into a world of uncertainty. Shortly after receiving his Masters of Fine Arts degree, he began setting up a creative space for himself[30] out of an Otisco Street apartment, where he displays his work. Campbell wants to make Jaleel Campbell Studios a dedicated space for Black artists to come together. 'In an ideal world where COVID isn't happening, I want to have this be the center of all Black art creativity going on here in Syracuse,' Campbell said. 'I want this to be the central hub where all of the Black creatives that are working here can meet each other and network and grow with one another.' Indigenous artist and graphic designer Ikerson Hopper has focused on art since his childhood[31]. He's picked up new mediums over the years, including graphic design, carvings and quillwork. Recently, he made shirts bringing awareness to the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women movement in the U.S.and Canada and donated a large portion of the proceeds to the Native Women's Shelter of Montreal. Lauren McComber, the owner of Lotus + Sage Holistics, loves how Hopper's artwork depicts Haudenosaunee culture and said she's never met an artist involved in social causes, building community and giving back quite like Hopper. Cuban immigrant Jos Miguel Hernndez Hurtado founded the La Joven Guardia del Teatro Latino in 1999 to enrich and educate disadvantaged youth through theater[32]. Since some children in Syracuse don't have a support system, he put together a group to help them increase their self-esteem. He serves as a mentor for his students inside and outside of the theater. '(La Joven Guardia del Teatro Latino) literally changed my whole life,' said Yanetsy Meriño Bacallao, one of his former students and the current president of La Joven Guardia.

The Waiting for Normalproject challenged photographers to turn the camera on themselves and their families while isolated from the rest of the world. In addition to photographs that illustrated their experiences, each photographer chose one all-encompassing word, supplemented by a journal entry, to describe their quarantine: how they felt, what they saw, how they changed. Fifteen photographers volunteered to take this challenge, and together, they created a quarantine memoir woven out of each of their distinct stories. They chronicled how they reunited with family, how they felt lost in between, how they adapted and grew.

[Editor's Note: This is the third and final installment of articles covering The Gatepost's 2020 political survey. The other two articles covered student views on the election and current political topics. You can read the other two articles on fsugatepost.com.]
In an unscientific survey conducted by The Gatepost from Oct. 5 to Oct. 15, students said they supported the Black Lives Matter Movement and were concerned about police misconduct and white supremacy movements.
Three-hundred students participated in the survey.
Approximately 92% percent of Gatepost student survey respondents said they support the Black Lives Matter Movement.
Approximately 93% of Gatepost survey respondents said they were concerned about instances of police misconduct. Additionally, 66% of respondents said they support redirecting police funding to social services programs.
Approximately 82% of survey respondents said they were worried about the rise of white supremacy movements in the U.S.
Approximately 92% of survey respondents said systemic racism impacts the United States.
Rep. Jack Lewis, a Democrat representing Ashland and a portion of the City of Framingham, said, ""I'm very impressed that the great majority - nearly 92% - of Framingham State students support the Black Lives Matter Movement.
""In a perfect world, this would be 100%,"" he added. ""But as we are reminded - and as shown on our TVs every evening on the nightly news - while we have made great progress in civil rights and great progress toward true racial justice and equity, the work continues.""
Constanza Cabello, vice president of diversity, inclusion, and community engagement, said, ""As a campus, we've said Black lives matter. We've affirmed that systemic racism is a reality.""
Cabello added Framingham State has made anti-racism ""mission critical,"" and said, ""That's central to our values.""
She added that nationally, people are viewing this year as a ""twin-demic. COVID-19 and the ongoing killing of black and brown bodies, and that's really impacted everything,"" she said.
Cabello said one of the most important actions the community can take to confront racism is to ""meet free speech with more free speech.""
Lorretta Holloway, vice president for enrollment and student development, said of all the information gathered in the 2020 Gatepost survey, she was least surprised that most of the student respondents support the Black Lives Matter Movement.
Holloway specifically referenced the racist acts of 2017 as an example of bias incidents that have occurred on campus.
""It [the racist incidents on campus] hits home in many ways for people,"" she added.
Black Lives Matter Movement
Of the 300 Gatepost student survey respondents, 275, 91.7%, said they support the Black Lives Matter Movement, and 25, 8.3%, do not.
Many FSU students shared why they support the Black Lives Matter Movement.
Some survey respondents replied by saying, ""Black Lives Matter,"" but did not provide any more of an explanation.
One survey respondent said, ""No lives matter until Black lives matter. I agree very strongly with the movement, and I think the police in America need to be defunded and have the funds go to other problems.""
Taylor Anderson, a senior English major, said, ""People need to stop ignoring what makes them uncomfortable. BLM should not just be a trend where people post a black square one week and forget about it the next.
""Movements require constant action. People need to vote, stand up for others, educate themselves, advocate for reform,"" she added.
Co-president of M.I.S.S. Mariah Farris said she thinks the Black Lives Matter Movement has received more attention due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
""It was the one thing I think COVID made a thing because everybody was trapped in their house,"" she said. ""Everybody had the news. It was on TV and on every channel. It was on social media. There was no getting away from it.""
Farris added, ""I think for the first time in a long time, or first time ever in my opinion, white people are actually seeing firsthand on the screen something that they haven't come to terms with or haven't seen before.""
Samantha Collette, president of the class of 2022, said, ""I do think students care about the BLM Movement, as reflected in The Gatepost survey results. Those responses further show that when racial incidents occur on our campus, they come from a very specific group of people and it does not reflect how the community feels toward people of color.""
Collette added, ""It also seems like the general University response is reactive and not preventative, as if they send out emails to reach out but it's only because bad things happened.""
Phoenix Harris, president of the Black Student Union , said, ""I think that everybody, no matter how vocal or active they are, can always do more.""
Harris said the Sociology and Psychology departments have been very vocal and supportive in the movement, but others not as much. ""They [other departments] could do a lot more to bring attention to what we feel is important.""
Cameron Duffy, a junior psychology major, said, ""I am surprised about the number of people who don't support the BLM Movement just because of the demographics that are present at Framingham State.""
However, some survey respondents said they were hesitant to support the Black Lives Matter Movement.
One Gatepost survey respondent said, ""Being a Black individual myself, I agree with the BLM statement, but not what they are trying to achieve through the movement.
""It counteracts that Black lives matter, and they pick and choose what they are for,"" they added.
Another survey respondent said, ""I support the message BLM is trying to send, but disagree with the organization's approach.""
Additionally, another Gatepost survey respondent said the Black Lives Matter Movement is no longer representing its original mission.
""I feel that the Black Lives Matter Movement has been corrupted and people are no longer vouching for the improvement of Black lives in this country, but instead are politicizing the movement to further their own interests,"" they said.
Ariana Nunez, vice president of Brother to Brother (B2B), said sometimes, she is worried about discussing her support for the Black Lives Matter Movement. ""If I want to bring it up to someone I don't know, it's scary because I don't know how they're going to react.
""I feel like I have to keep my guard up because I don't know everybody here - I'm meeting new people every day,"" she added.
Tara Donovan, a junior English major, said she supports the Black Lives Matter Movement, but is concerned with its portrayal in the media.
""I'm worried about how they're reporting on that stuff,"" she said. ""A lot of people will get the wrong idea of what Black Lives Matter means. I think people are getting the idea that young kids are rioting.""
Another Gatepost survey respondent said, ""I support Black lives and know they're in danger, but I refuse to support a movement that condones violence toward businesses and innocent people.""
Sociology Professor Virginia Rutter said people who are less informed about these issues are likely to be more hesitant about supporting the Black Lives Matter Movement.
""This [hesitation to support the BLM Movement] has to do with a lack of information, a lack of the provision of enough support for understanding that Black Lives Matter is a simple and core premise that takes nothing from anyone else and only gives us all the best that's possible,"" she said.
Criminology Professor Xavier Guadalupe-Diaz said, ""What we're experiencing right now with the movement for Black lives is a culmination of centuries of systemic white supremacist marginalization in the U.S., which was compounded by layers of crises happening here and around the world.""
He noted the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as ""a crippled economy, the erosion of democratic norms in U.S. institutions, and the rise of populist authoritarianism,"" as crises.
Police Misconduct
The Gatepost survey also found 279 students, 93%, were concerned about incidents of police brutality, while 21, 7%, were not.
Several Gatepost survey respondents stated they were dissatisfied with President Donald J. Trump's approach to the recent incidents of police misconduct.
One survey respondent said, ""It is highly concerning to me the way Trump has handled racial injustice and police brutality situations recently.""
This survey respondent added, ""I can't in good conscience vote for a racist president.""
Another Gatepost survey respondent said, ""I understand 'All lives matter' or 'Not all police officers are bad,' but we need to care for Black lives because they do not choose to be the race they are.
""They are born being Black, while police officers put themselves in these situations,"" they said. ""We must care for all lives, but most importantly, Black lives right now!""
Lidia Flores, co-president of Latinos Unidos N' Accion , said, ""Everything is based off the color of your skin. My parents every day have to worry about being pulled over because of the color of their skin.
""Not only is it the white police officers - it's your fellow Hispanics and African Americans, too,"" she said. ""It's sad someone has to fear when they see a cop. One shouldn't have to fear those who are there to protect us.""
Another survey respondent said, ""I believe that police brutality is a thing and that POC [people of color] have become targeted victims of police brutality because of the systemic racism in our country.""
BSU president Harris said the police and justice system's actions are going to be difficult to fix and what the nation is currently doing is not enough.
""We are going to have to figure out something else to do, because what we're doing is not working,"" she said.
Spencer Lezin, a junior business management major, said, ""It's honestly really sad how we cannot fully trust people who are supposed to protect us.""
M.I.S.S. co-president Ewine Fedna said people of color's fear of police is not new.
""Before Trump's presidency, the fear of cops was there, but it was never every day when you got into the car and prayed that you got home,"" she said.
B2B Vice President Nunez said, ""Obviously, police brutality has been a thing for ages, but I feel like now, after COVID, things are really being brought to light.""
While many of the survey respondents said they supported at least some funding from police departments being redirected to support social services programs, a small number said they were against the idea.
One Gatepost survey respondent said, ""I'm concerned about police brutality, but a whole group of people should not be condemned for a few bad apples. That goes for any party, race, job, or group.""
Brad Medeiros, chief of the Framingham State University Police Department , said while they are not allowed to comment on political activity, FSUPD remains committed to supporting diversity within the community.
He said in the past year, FSUPD officers have received extensive diversity training in areas such as preventing and responding to hate crimes, managing bias, diversity and inclusion in the modern workplace, mental health first aid (including police interactions), criminal justice reform, de-escalation training, fair and impartial policing, and First Amendment rights.
Medeiros added, ""The University Police Department is committed to continuous improvement, to ensuring that our training reflects best practices.
""We will continue to review recommendations - both nationally and locally - to identify areas for enhancing our policies and training,"" he added.
Police Funding
Of the 300 Gatepost survey respondents, 229 students, 76.3%, said they support some police funding being redirected to support social services programs, 36, 12%, said they do not, and 35, 11.7%, said they were unsure.
Rep. Lewis said, ""I'm optimistic that we, as a local community, but also as a nation, are going to find a way to move forward in a way that ensures that our communities are [not only] safe, but that those of us with family members of color and friends of color don't have to worry about the possibility that a speeding ticket for our Black sons could lead to a death sentence.""
Several Gatepost survey respondents said they support the national movement for defunding the police.
Undeclared freshman Gustavo Pazi said, ""Too much strength is being given to them in the form of new high-end equipment, and leniency in rules against them has made it so they have free rein to do whatever they want to the citizens that they're supposed to protect.
""Defunding the police is definitely the correct course we should take, but I also feel it wouldn't be enough in the long run,"" he added. ""We should be defunding the police and the military at the same time.""
LUNA co-president Flores said, ""Defunding the police can help the community and help each other, because the police are not helping us.
""Being from a low-income city myself, it is the best solution to help our community grow and get better,"" she said.
Eddy Olu, a junior computer science major, said, ""Recently, my city has poured money into new police squad cars, but there are some potholes that have been on certain streets that have been there since I was a child.""
He added, ""Putting money into fixing streets and actually progressing cities would be a nice first step.""
Tadiwa Chitongo, a junior biochemistry major, said, ""The police need to be defunded. The money needs to be going to extracurricular activities and making sure that children have places to spend their time and go for help in case they need it.""
He recommended art programs, shelters, and orphanages as other places to reallocate funding.
Elizabeth Dollard, a sophomore elementary education major, said, ""I do believe that some of the excessive funding could be reallocated to different parts of the community. My main belief is that education could desperately use some of these funds.
""Otherwise, I think some of the funds the law enforcement profession have could be used instead to fund training to further enforce how to avoid excessive force,"" Dollard added.
Another Gatepost survey respondent said, ""While I believe in the Black Lives Matter Movement, I do not believe the police should be defunded in hopes that it will stop police brutality.
""I believe that instead, the funds should be used to buy nondeadly weapons to replace guns and [fund] training in ways to bring in a suspect safely so that way everyone feels safe,"" they added.
FSU President F. Javier Cevallos said, ""One thing that we have to be more nuanced about is what defunding the police means.
""You do need to have, obviously, police security. Not everybody is a good citizen and not everybody is going to behave,"" he added. ""So, that word 'defunding' tends to be misinterpreted.""
Cevallos said the police should invest in social programs, training, and different kinds of activities, ""especially community policing.
""That is different than just taking money away from the police. And I think that people react strongly one way or [another] for the police. If somebody tries to break into my house, I want to have a police officer around,"" Cevallos added.
History Professor Jon Huibregtse compared the United States' police force funding to that of other countries.
""It is my understanding that in countries where they have redirected money into social services and into kinds of preventative programming, crime has declined,"" he said.
Vice President Holloway said she encourages people to talk about why police have become militarized instead of putting that money toward more intense training programs.
Holloway said the question that should be asked is why police funds are going toward ""excess military supplies"" rather than services such as mental health and community policing.
She also acknowledged police forces often receive a larger portion of the budget than public schools, community aid programs, and in some cases, fire departments.
She said she believes ""defund the police"" is ""a fear-inducing term.""
White Supremacy Movements
Of the Gatepost survey respondents, 245 students, 81.7%, said they were concerned about the rise of white supremacy movements in the U.S., and 55, 18.3%, said they were not.
Student Trustee McKenzie Ward said she was surprised to see 18.3% of respondents were not worried about the rise of white supremacy groups.
""In recent years, we have seen more hate crimes occurring and we have seen literal Nazi parades occur in our country,"" she said. ""It makes me worried that people are not paying enough attention to what is going on in the world.""
Rep. Lewis said the rise of white supremacy ""should be a concern to everyone.""
He added, ""We have a moral obligation to make sure that everyone, regardless of their political affiliation, from law enforcement all the way through to the elected leaders - from local mayors all the way up to the president - denounce these movements.""
Lewis referenced President Trump's remarks at the first presidential debate.
""Hearing the president during the first presidential debate this year telling the Proud Boys group to 'stand by' was alarming and concerning, and, for those who paid attention, a clear sign of where his heart truly is as it relates to justice and equity,"" he said.
According to The New York Times, the Proud Boys is a far-right group that is known for endorsing violence. The group describes itself as a ""pro-western fraternal organization for men,"" and has been tied to violent incidents at protests.
Mia Ihegie, a junior political science major and president of Justice, Unity, Inclusion, Community, Equity (J.U.I.C.E.), said, ""I learned that no matter how many visuals you can give, or facts you can put in people's faces, ignorance is something that can't be healed.
""I personally feel that ignorance is a disease that no one is looking for a cure. The ignorant will stay ignorant until they are ready to learn,"" she added.
Nicholas Miranda, a junior marketing major, said, ""I absolutely think that white supremacy needs to be addressed. With the number of people supporting the All Lives Matter Movement, it's clear that there are plenty of people who have white supremacist mindsets ingrained within themselves.""
One survey respondent said they find it very troubling to see the rise of white supremacy movements in the U.S.
""I feel like our country is in a huge battle with ourselves,"" they said.
Carmen McLaughlin, a senior history major, said, ""This is something that should have been addressed way before today."" She added it's not right that in 2020, people still have to be afraid of ""far-right groups like the KKK.""
One Gatepost survey respondent said, ""I think racism and white supremacy have always been in this country. I think that Trump's position as president has made racists and white supremacists more vocal.""
Vice President Holloway said white supremacy movements have been around since ""at least the birth of the KKK.
""The current political climate has allowed them [white supremacist groups] to have more of a voice and more influence.""
She added, ""The joining of forces between many of these groups with armed militia groups should cause concern for everyone, not just BIPOC [Black, Indigenous, and people of color] who live here.""
Professor Guadalupe-Diaz said the most troubling part about the rise of white supremacy to him is that they [hate groups] have become increasingly ""emboldened and normalized.
""What we are seeing now is this growing militia movement that has, historically, facilitated major acts of domestic terrorism and mass violence,"" he added.
He said people need to be more ""vigilant"" about how authority figures normalize white supremacy.
Education and Faculty-led Initiatives
Many Gatepost survey respondents, as well as students, professors, and administrators interviewed by The Gatepost, discussed the need for more education within the FSU community to address incidents of racial bias.
Vice President Cabello said education is essential to combating racial injustice.
""It's really up to us to create opportunities for education, but also opportunities for multiple voices to be heard,"" she said.
Cabello said the Bias Education Response Team (B.E.R.T.) is one of those on-campus resources for bias education.
She said, ""A lot of times, people think we're [B.E.R.T.] just a response team.
""But, we have been doing prevention and education, too,"" she added.
Cabello said while she feels good about the work the University has undertaken, the biggest challenge it faces is that it is going to take ""a lot of time"" to undo systemic racism.
Several students said they were dissatisfied with certain offices' approaches to educating the community about racial inequality.
President of J.U.I.C.E. Ihegie said she believes FSU should employ professors who are willing to teach what is happening in the ""current political climate.
""Not everyone is going to see the survey. Not everyone is going to hear about a Black Lives Matter event. Not everyone is going to hear the things they [Framingham State administrators] are promoting,"" she added.
Ihegie said one way the FSU community can promote anti-racism education is for the University to hold more programs - in the classroom and out - to educate students.
SGA Secretary Lexi Kays said she believes the University ""should be talking more.
""I feel as though individual departments are handling it well on social media, but the University as a whole sent a couple of emails back at the height of everything in June but hasn't mentioned much since,"" said Kays.
She said she wants all students to feel safe and comfortable on campus regardless of their race or ethnicity.
Senior English major Taylor Anderson said, ""In addition to protests, we should definitely educate ourselves more on these issues.""
Class of 2022 President Samantha Collette said, ""On campus, it seems like some departments and offices care more than others.""
Collette specifically said she sees the Dean's Office, New Student and Family Programs, and Residence Life using social media to provide material and resources about racial bias and equity.
She added she does not see this kind of action being taken by other offices on campus.
Professor Huibregtse said he believes FSU has done a lot to combat racism, but knows there is still work to be done.
""From a faculty perspective, I know we're trying,"" he said. ""Is that to say we've solved the issue? Absolutely not. Can we do more? Absolutely yes! People are trying, and we probably need to try harder in some instances.""
English Professor Kelly Matthews said, ""Students are really leading in terms of advocacy against racism.""
She added the Faculty Against Hate group was inspired by the students who protested in 2017 after racial incidents in residence halls and said there needs to be an ongoing conversation between students and professors to address racial issues.
""We, as professors, need to share power across that student-professor division, and we need to open up to examining, acknowledging, and addressing those power disparities - especially the ways in which they show up around racism and ethnicity,"" Matthews said.
She encouraged students to ""keep speaking out and speaking up"" about racial inequity.

There's a new announcement: (whispers) You're basic.DB: From Business Insider and Stitcher this is Household Name. Brands you know, stories you don't. I'm Dan Bobkoff. Today:YOUTUBE: The PSL!JOHN OLIVER: The coffee that tastes like a candle.DB: The icon of being basic: the Starbucks' Pumpkin Spice Latte. How did that happen?YOUTUBE: It's definitely not the worst thing I've ever had.YOUTUBE: Pumpkin Spice Latte! Does it deserve the hype?DB: Stay with us.ACT IDB: Can you introduce yourself please?KATE TAYLOR: I'm Kate Taylor. And there are three things you should know about me relevant to our discussion today. Number one: I cover retail and fast food here at Business Insider. Number two: Sometimes I get my coffee at Starbucks. And number three: I consider myself to be a little bit basic, or as some people might say, a bit of a basic bitch.DB: Well then, it's like your Christmas!KT: Yes, it is! It's Pumpkin Spice Latte season!DB: I have so many questions.KT: And I am here for you.DB: OK, first of all Why is Starbucks basic?KT: I will explain.DB: And why of all things in the world, is the Starbucks pumpkin spice latte the ultimate symbol of being basic?KT: Ok, I can get you these answers. But you're going to have to come with me to a place called the Liquid Lab.PETER DUKES: And to kind of help set the mood, we actually set up the lab so it kind of felt like Thanksgiving, if you will, with leaves and pumpkins and everyone brought in pumpkin pies.DB: What's happening?KT: This is Peter Dukes, in a Starbucks lab in 2003. And watch. He's about to invent something that will change the course of history.PD: People brought in pumpkin pies and everybody has a different pumpkin pie recipe that comes from their family and some are high pumpkin, low spice; high pumpkin, high spice; low pumpkin, low spice.KT: He's been a product manager at Starbucks for almost two decades.PD: There's all these different variations and what we did is we poured shots of espresso on them, mixed them up and actually eat them with our fork.KT: Peter and the rest of his team are basically combining all of these different things together. A little bit of pumpkin pie, a little bit of espresso, and really just like making a Frankenstein combination of the two.PD: And it was through that process that you start to discover or realize that pumpkin pie, there's a heavier body that comes with it.KT: They kind of realize that it's hard to combine them exactly, so they're going to have to create kind of a syrup that captures the flavor of spicy pumpkin pie without just dumping pumpkin into a bunch of coffee. And that's basically how they created the pumpkin spice latte.PD: A recipe that would be high in pumpkin and high in spice.KT: There you go. Date of birth: 2003. First name: Pumpkin. Middle Name: Spice. Last name: Latte. For short: PSL.DB: What happened next?KT: Peter brought it to a focus group. And people are telling him 'well, we're not sure if we want to buy this thing, but it sure is...something. 'PD: I don't want to say off the charts but it was one of the higher beverages in terms of how it scored in terms of uniqueness.KT: Uniqueness. What's funny about that is, we're in 2003 and people think this drink, the pumpkin spice latte is completely unique!DB: It's a liquid pie with espresso.KT: Right, but let's fast forward a few years and the pumpkin spice latte — the PSL — is now the symbol of the exact opposite of unique. It's defined a movement. It's the poster child of being, and i'm going to use the full term here a basic bitch...which is liking things that everyone likes, even if you don't realize your taste is painfully mainstream.DB: So, Peter Dukes is the father of being basic?KT: (laughs) Not quite. Starbucks didn't mean for the PSL to become the symbol of a certain kind of person. In fact, I'm not sure if Peter Dukes knows what basic means, or maybe he's just pretending to be ignorant.KT: As the inventor of the PSL, how do you define basic? PD: You know...as you were talking, I was going to, if i'm allowed to pivot the question: What's your definition of basic?DB: well funny he should ask...FOCUS GROUP:Only getting coffee from Starbucks. Uggs. Rose Iced coffee. Avocado toast. Lily Pulitzer Denim jackets. Green smoothies. Brunch. Bean boots. DB: Kate, as you can tell I've been doing some research of my own. I focused group-ed our office.DB: Are you all basic?FOCUS GROUP: I've been told so, and I guess I agree? I'm extremely basic. I think I might be. I think it's just embracing what's popular but thinking it's special. I think it's just doing what the majority of the rest of the world is doing and you thinking you're cool because you're following that. If I were to post a picture, they'd be like 'oh, she's so basic. Of course she'd post this picture.'DB: OK, but what I don't understand is why the PSL of all drinks the most basic of them all. I mean, why is Starbucks in general basic? And how did it get that way? Because I remember not that long ago when the knock was that it was making coffee expensive!JIMMY KIMMEL: A seven dollar cup of coffee? I feel like this is a test to find out just how stupid we are.DB: And complicated.YOU'VE GOT MAIL: The whole purpose of places like Starbucks is for people with no decision-making ability whatsoever to make six decisions just to buy one cup of coffee.DB: And elitist.ANTI-HOWARD DEAN AD: Take you tax-hiking, government-expanding, latte-drinking, sushi-eating, Volvo-driving, New York Times-readingDB: How did Starbucks go from all that to painfully mainstream?KT: Okay, let's do some quick time travel. Because to know the PSL, you need to know where it came from.Imagine: It's the early 1970s, and a shop in Seattle opens calls Starbucks. It doesn't even serve hot drinks. Just coffee beans.And come with me through the '70s and '80s and '90s, and America's mainstream coffee culture was counter coffee, or cuppa joe — it's the kind of coffee that you just order it at a diner or corner store and they'd hand it to you immediately from a big batch that had already been made. I mean, it only cost a buck, so it didn't have to be fancy.Then as the corporate lore goes, a guy named Howard Schultz takes a trip to Italy in 1983 and is taken with the country's coffee culture. He liked dropping in for an espresso and hanging out.Schultz then comes back and buys the six Starbucks stores in Seattle and he transforms them into the coffee chain we know today — into the mainstream coffee culture we know today.He decided the person behind the counter would get an Italian title: barista. The baristas would make the drinks with fancy names like lattes and cappuccinos and macchiatos. Not many people in the US had even heard of these drinks before.In fact, in a 1992 article about Starbucks expanding, the New York Times had to tell readers how to pronounce the word 'latte.'DB: What were people saying before they knew how to say it?KT: Maybe late-ee?? But—DB: I'd like a lat-ey, please.KT: One lay-tay. Um, no it's literally the New York Times has to say how to pronounce it.And there wouldn't be a big batch of espressos behind the counter; the baristas took time to make each drink individually and then they would call you buy your name when your drink was ready.BRYANT SIMON: At the outset, much of it was kind of brilliant for Starbucks. One, it gave Starbucks this kind of veneer of European-ness, right?DB: Who's this?KT: This is Bryant Simon. He's going to join us for our journey for a bit. He's a historian at Temple University, and he's also kind of obsessed with Starbucks. It started at a New Years party.BS: We bought a bottle of French champagne and everybody kind of stopped drinking it and once was open, it would go bad if I didn't stop and so I finished the bottle and then woke up the next morning feeling predictably crappy and got in the car because no one else was up and where did I find myself? I found myself at a Starbucks in a strip mall in suburban Atlanta.KT: He's hungover and bleary-eyed. And he starts coming back to life and observing the people around him, like a good academic.BS: They were chatting, there was a kind of buzz to the place. I began to think there was something going on there and it wasn't just about selling coffee.KT: And this morning starts him on an odyssey. He went on to visit 400 Starbucks locations and then wrote a book called Everything But The Coffee: Learning about America From Starbucks.So, we're still in the 90s now and Starbucks is becoming a national chain. Americans are starting to get to know these strange sounding words like venti and grande and cappuccino.BS: You know, language and names are a way to create insider and outsider groups. Right, teenagers do this all the time create a language that their parents can't understand. And Starbucks created a language that you had to master in order to belong.Now it wasn't that hard. But it did create insiders and outsiders and I think part of the reason why people paid for Starbucks was this kind of belonging they got with it. The way that the kind of hyper-detail to the orders to those outsiders was easy to mock, now when I talk to a lot of people who worked at Starbucks they said the customers who needed belonging the most often had the most kind of difficult to say drinks.DB: Wait, 'the customers who needed belonging had the hardest to say drinks.' That's almost kind of touchingKT: Yeah, and maybe a little sad.DB: it's also like really personal I mean they are making these custom drinks for individuals. It feels like a far cry from the idea of being basic.KT: Totally. There's also a kind of cool factor, some cachet, in being a Starbucks person. It's saying that you're in the know and you're also not afraid to drop multiple dollars on a single cup of coffee.BS: When I was doing my research, a young Madison Avenue executive told me that in the mid 1990s, he got a job at an advertising firm right out of college, he wasn't making very much money, and on Mondays he would go buy a cup of Starbucks. And he'd take the sleeve off and he would walk into the office with kind of the logo first. And then when he was finished the coffee, he would put it back in his bag and fill it up at home the next day. So people thought he was buying Starbucks every day.DB: That's a disgusting way to have status.KT: I know, I do not think that would fly today...but in the '90s, Starbucks is like the BMW of beverages.BS: One of the people I talked to for my book said, 'people can't see me everyday in my BMW but they can see me carrying a cup of Starbucks.' And so the very overspending of coffee, one said like that you had money. Second, the fact that you could tell the difference between Starbucks or at least appear to an ordinary coffee made you look like you had taste and culture and refinement. And so what it became was kind of an affordable form of luxury.KT: And it's becoming an available luxury. At this point, Starbucks has 3,500 stores.NEWS: 4, 3, 2, 1, Happy 2000!DB: Oh wow, it's the new millennium. I remember this.KT: Yes, happy new year. And Howard Schultz says he has a resolution: In this brand new century, he's saying he wants to go from 3,500 stores to more than 20,000.FIGHT CLUB: Planet Starbucks.DB: After the break, we'll find out how that expansion collided with the concept of Basic, in hip hop, and then YouTube.ACT IIDB: Alright Kate, so when we left off, Howard Shultz was planning a massive expansion from 3500 to 20,000 stores. Which is a lot.KT: Yes. So many! And now Americans are getting used to the fancy coffee names, and they're starting to see Starbucks everywhere.ELLEN DEGENERES: So this morning I went to Starbucks. You know Starbucks, you've heard of Starbucks. There's one on the corner, next to the Starbucks, across from the Starbucks.THE SIMPSONS: ""Can I help you?"" ""I'd like to get my ear pierced"" ""Well, better make it quick, kiddo, in 5 minutes this place is becoming a Starbucks.""KT: So as you can hear Starbucks is popping up everywhere and people are getting a little bit annoyed. So let's kind jump ahead to around 2006.BS: Starbucks itself is beginning to lose some of its popularity, it's beginning to lose some of its kind of customer base. It has to sort of struggle with this, and which it will do for the next 10 or so years.KT: Starbucks no longer like a BMW. Starbucks is now more like a Toyota Camry. It's still selling a ton, but Bryant notices around now it's becoming more ubiquitous and maybe forgettable.BS: In some ways, it was just the kind of ordinariness and sameness of it kind of overwhelmed me. And I remember while I was doing my research, it was in the period where they kept playing Alanis Morissette over and over again and it seemed like wherever I went I got that acoustic version of the Alanis Morissette record that drove me crazy. It was that first record, Jagged Little Pill. [laughter]I don't even remember the name of that song. I think I've tried to repress that memory. And that was my own personal pain. It also spoke to just how ordinary and the same a lot of Starbucks were.[IRONIC CLIP]DB: Isn't it ironic that Starbucks is becoming basic?KT: No comment. But you're getting it. Starbucks is becoming mainstream. And then just when fate seems doomed to everyman ubiquitous ordinariness...Peter Dukes has his mad scientist moment in a lab with some nutmeg, cinnamon and ginger.DB: And there's the Pumpkin Spice Latte! On the menu!KT: And yes, people are buying it.PD: I'll never forget coming in and pulling the numbers and looking at the numbers and how well it sold and then you just knew you had a winner and you picked up the phone, you talked to some store managers directly, and the excitement in their voice and how they talked about how much their customers enjoyed it, how much our partners, our baristas loved this beverage, you just knew that you had a beverage that was going to resonate.KT: It's not resonating with those ad executive-types who used to show off their Starbucks coffee cups in the office. But it starts to build a fanbase.DB: So, in this period, does drinking a PSL at Starbucks say anything about you as a person?KT: Not at first, maybe it just means you really love fall. But it wasn't an icon of being basic at first. In fact, the term basic bitch wasn't really used that much until around 2009.DB: Ok, I found someone who I think can help us understand all this. Noreen Malone is a features editor at New York Magazine. She wrote one of the seminal pieces analyzing basicness back in 2014, and she has a good sense of how the idea of being ""basic"" came to define the kind of person who might buy a Pumpkin Spice Latte.NOREEN MALONE: We should be clear that the term basic was totally appropriated from hip hop culture by white women to describe other white women which is you know sort of a basic thing to do if you want to frame it that way.DB: Around 2009, the Black comedian Lil Duval used it in a rap.[LIL DUVAL CLIP]KT: Yeah, that's about the time that ""basic bitch"" first shows up online, on Urban Dictionary in 2009NM: I think it sort of crossed over via a couple of things. There was this rapper Kreayshawn. She was a white rapper around 2010 2011 who was sort of a figure of ridicule but she had a song where she was shouting out luxury brands and saying basic bitches love these things.[KREAYSHAWN CLIP]NM: And then there was a viral YouTube star, a young sort of pre-adolescent boy named Lohanthony who had a very charming video where he said calling all the basic bitches and that went viral.LOHANTHONY: Calling all the basic bitches, calling all the basic bitches. There's a new announcement. (whispers) You're basic.NM: And so it came to a wider audience and then it basically became sort of white woman on white woman crime right. That these that some women were using it to describe other women who they didn't think had interesting taste. And you know of course men can be described as basic too. I think it's really context dependent. It does tend to mean this you know sort of stereotypically sorority girl thing.KT: And so now we're in 2013.DB: The PSL is ten years old!KT: About as old as LohanthonyDB: And you have a smartphone now.KT: Yes, and by now the PSL is a tradition. And it's no coincidence that the rise of the PSL charts pretty evenly with the rise of smartphones.PD: Over time, you had these PSL fanatics who are so looking forward to the return of PSL and then it arrives and they announce that it's arrived and there's so much excitement and that marker of fall and then you know obviously when it goes away, they lament the fact that it's, they can't get it anymore and you know wait another year before it returns.KT: So Starbucks is encouraging a lot of this. They have ads and special cups and a special twitter account for the PSL, though they would not call the customers ""basic"".But the difference is now it's 2013. I have Instagram and Snapchat on my phone. And I want to tell all my friends just how excited I am that it's pumpkin spice latte season. So I take a picture. And let's see hashtag PSL.And so do all my friends.Now people who write for the internet — so, people like me — are noticing. That the PSL— hashtag PSL—is a thing. And you can see a whole bunch of articles appear online around this time.DB: And so basically, this is this the moment that the Pumpkin Spice Latte and basicness, these two absurd concepts, converge in the world.KT: Basically, yes.COLLEGEHUMOR: It's gonna be fine, no matter what happens, babe. I got your results back, and, um, you're a basic bitch. You've been tweeting about Starbucks. Hashtag caffeine. Where did you come up with that?KT: That CollegeHumor video has more than 13 million views. And now we get this Taylor Swift parodyTAYLOR SWIFT PARODY: It's that time of year. Pumpkin spice is here. I can't wait to drink...KT: This anthropological offering from Hoodwinked Films.HOODWINKED: The changing of the seasons and the leaves falling marks a very important part of year for the basic bitch. That means that it's pumpkin spice latte season down at the Starbucks.KT: And then — we're almost back to 2018 — Martha Stewart goes on Watch What Happens with Andy Cohen and puts any mystery that's left to rest.ANDY COHEN: Pumpkin spice everything delicious, or for basic bitches only?MARTHA STEWART: It's the latter.AC: Oh, for basic bitches? Martha Stewart says pumpkin spice is for basic bitches, you guys? I love it this is the greatest moment of this show ever!DB: But I still want to know: is calling someone ""basic"" an insult?FOCUS GROUP: I wouldn't say it's a bad thing. I'm basic and I'm proud. (laughs)DB: This is that group of self-described basics from our office you heard earlier.FOCUS GROUP:I'd say I try not to be basic, but then I love all of the things that are basic, and so there's no point in being ashamed of that. I mean, It's just my lifestyle (laughs)I think it's an insult if you're like generally basic but you're trying not to be and then someone accuses you of it.Yeah, I think that if somebody posts a photo of like a sunset on Instagram, and they might really think that's beautiful and want to share that with the world, but then somebody just comes in and undercuts that with 'that's basic' because they see a lot of sunset pictures on Instagramit's an insult. You know, so for sure. It's changed everything. Because you know how it might be perceived. And—Do you think you post predictable things?Well, I mean, yeah, maybe.Like what?Well, like a sunset, for instance.You only post sunsets?No, Lauren. (laughs) I don't only post sunsets.What about coffee??NM: And a lot of what people are criticizing is that you know these women, mostly women, have the wrong taste and brands that they like these mass market things, they you know are buying whatever people are selling them.DB: And remember those brands that exude basicnessFOCUS GROUP: Only getting coffee from Starbucks. Uggs. Rose Iced coffee. Avocado toast. Lily Pulitzer Denim jackets. Green smoothies. Brunch. Bean boots.DB: Noreen thinks that list is getting a bit dated.NM: We should probably update our definition of basic and I'm not exactly sure what those brands are. You know again it's so contingent like I think if you're in San Francisco wearing Allbirds is probably a pretty basic thing to do. But like avocado toast and Uggs have been a punchline for a really long time now. I think we could stand to update it.KT: Some new punchlines might come as a relief to Peter Dukes, the guy who invented the PSL. This poor guy has been developing espresso drinks for years and the one thing everyone always wants to talk to him about is the PSL.PD: I am now comfortable with when my daughter's friends come up and say 'oh you worked on the PSL.' I'm like, 'yeah it was a fun experience, I worked with a great team on it and you know, you never know when you take risks, you never know what's going to happen with it.' So I'm to the point fine where I'm comfortable with that.KT: Was that a process for you?PD: Yes, that was definitely a process.KT: But as much as Peter Dukes and Starbucks don't like to talk about it, if the basics move on to some other coffee place, that could be bad for the chain.DB: Yeah, Noreen talked about that.DB: Do you think Starbucks will always be basic?NM: You know, I don't know. I think again there is a little bit of an aspirational element to basic consumption patterns. So if Starbucks ceases to be aspirational for that group of people then it might not. You know Starbucks is a huge corporation with shareholders that it has to satisfy. I think that they probably are going to work very hard to keep their sort of market penetration really really high. And if that means appealing to a certain group of people I think they will continue to try to do it.DB: So our main question is: How did Starbucks and the PSL become the symbol of basicness? And it seems that it's this convergence of the rise of Instagram culture and SnapChat at the same time as you have youtube stars coming out, at the same time that you have online media writing think pieces about everything happening in culture, and then there's this one event every fall where people go to the local starbucks and there are now thousands and thousands of them so it's ubiquitous and everywhere and they have to Instagram their first PSL of the year, hashtag PSL, and therefore a cultural phenomenon is born.KT: At the center of the idea of what the PSL is and at the center of what being a basic bitch means is a force between something being mainstream and something being unique or cool. So starbucks started as really unique and cool and then as it became mainstream, that's when it became basic. And the PSL kind of embodies that where it's just a really sweet drink that comes across once a year and it's not really that creative if everyone can get it. But because everyone's talking about it, every basic bitch needs to have one.DB: And so if Starbucks hadn't opened so many stores, stores across the street from other stores, they never would have been able to have something that was so ubiquitous that it could be crowned as basic.KT: Totally. If Starbucks was still kind of this indielittle coffee chain that people were going to to feel special and artsy, then there's no way something out of there would have been the crown jewel in the basic bitch kind of repertoire.DB: Kate, so you report on Starbucks a lot, where is the company going now?KT: It's going in a lot of different directions. On the one hand, it's opening these new fancy stores called Roasteries that have a fancy pourover type drinks and all these rare kind of different blends and different beans that coffee aficionados have come to love - and that they're willing to pay $10 for.And then at the same time, 80% of new Starbucks locations are drive-throughsHoward Schultz left and is rumored to be thinking of running for public office. While that happens, the company is grappling with a very high profile racial bias incident in Philadelphia that led to the chain closing all of its stores in the US for hours while the employees had racial bias sensitivity training.So, Starbucks is having some trouble being all things to all people — including the ""basic"" crowd that's become a huge part of its customer base.DB: And what's next for the pumpkin spice latte?KT: Well it's definitely not just a starbucks thing anymore. There's literally pumpkin spice deodorant now, like—DB: Ugh!KT: It's, i think we might have hit peak PSL and now we're kind of going from being the symbol of being basic to just everywhere. And when something's everywhere, it loses some of that symbolic momentum.DB: huh it's like losing its basicness but becoming more basic?Kate: Exactly. (laughs)DB: Kate. Early on you told us that the guy who created the PSL, Peter Dukes, doesn't really know what basic means.KT: I actually think he does, but he was a little careful when we were talking.Here's the rest of his answer when I asked him about the PSL being basic being the height of unoriginalPD: Yeah I don't I wish I could answer that question, but I just I don't. I don't know how to answer that one, about the basicPeople like to customize their beverages here so even with the PSL, people discover their own unique way to make their PSL so whether that's adding a shot of espresso or using almond milk or soy milk to create their own PSL experience. If that's basic, ok!KT: Are you ok with it kind of having that reputation, or is that something you think about? Or not at all?PD: It's not something I think too much about. Again, I guess I link that back to as we were talking about earlier, people seem to have fun with the PSL. And you know, that marker of fall. And you know having fun with this beverage and if that's basic so be it.KT: (laughs)DB: Noreen put it a little more bluntly.NM: Wouldn't you be like embarrassed if like this thing that you thought was so cool and innovative became like this stand in for all that's wrong with the tastes of a certain kind of American? I would. (laughs) But you know like laughing all the way to the bank probably.DB: So Kate Taylor, you told us at the beginning that you are a self described basic. You also cover starbucks extensively for Business Insider. How do you feel about all this now?KT: I feel excited. I'm excited for basicness to evolve and I'm excited for starbucks to evolve. Like, I like avocado toast, I like PSL, I'm excited what basic thing will be bestowed on me next. And as a reporter, it's such a cool time to cover Starbucks where they could kind of plunge off a cliff and not be able to continue being everything to everyone but they're kind of throwing a ton of things at the wall and seeing what sticks. So it's an interesting time for both being a basic bitch and a Starbucks reporter.DB: Are you ready for your 2018 pumpkin spice latte?KT: Oh I am so ready. I will be there the first day possible.DB: I think I'll pass.KT: #PSL.DB: (laughs) Coming up. How the reviewers on Amazon's top rated sweatpants made one person feel less alone.ACT IIIDB: It's time for Product Misplacement. This is the part of the show where we hear how brands have played a part in our listeners' lives — for better or worse. My friend Jean Hannah Edelstein tells the story of how the top-rated sweatpants on Amazon made her feel less alone.JEAN HANNAH EDELSTEIN: About two and a half years ago I think, it was January of 2016, and I had just gotten dumped by someone who I was very into, let's say. (laughs) Having a relationship was the, which was the kind of relationship that all the red flags were there, that it wasn't going to go anywhere good, but nonetheless I had really put my heart into it.I was first diagnosed with depression when I was 14. Most of the time it feels, you know I've had a lot of experience with it and a lot of treatment so it feels pretty well managed but certain life events can definitely kind of send me spinning and in this case, I was really low or as I like to describe to people, it feels like I'm wearing a hat made out of cement so everything that I'm trying to do feels just heavy and difficult, so it meant that it was very hard for me to get up in the morning, hard to go to work, hard to see friends, all I really wanted to do was like, stay inside and sit on my couch and eat soup.But I did have one problem which is that I had a dog. The dog is a totally delightful dog but the problem was that I had to take her out twice a day and that really went in opposition to my ideal situation of never leaving my house again. Um, so anyway, it was January, it was super cold and I was like 'I need to get some sweatpants.' (laughs) Because I needed, you know, clothes to wear when I was taking the dog out.Um I wanted them to be something that was just like, I was so depressed I was really struggling to get up in the morning anyway so I was like, 'I need something that I can just put on without thinking about it.' I had some leggings, the leggings were too much effort like if that's a measure of how bad I felt. (laughs) So I was like, 'ok, I'm gonna buy some sweatpants.' And then I was like, 'well, I'm too depressed to go to the store, I don't want to think about what sweatpants to buy.' So I was like, 'ok, I'm going to go on Amazon and I'm gonna buy the top-rated sweatpants on Amazon.'DB: What were the top-rated sweatpants on Amazon in the winter of 2016?JHE: They were men's Champion, charcoal gray heather sweatpants, crucially with an open bottom. You know like you get the sweatpants with the elastic bottom? These had an open bottom.DB: Sorry, open bottom?JHE: Yeah.DB: That sounds like a hospital gown.JHE: Around the ankle, yeah.DB: Oh ok, not that kind of bottom! [laughter]JHE: So let's re-record this: Champion, men's, charcoal gray heather sweatpants with an open hem, so not the elastic around the ankle, they were open around the ankle which made them easy to pull on and off, even if you were wearing shoes, which was an important detail.So I saw that those were the top-rated sweatpants and I thought, 'ok I'm just gonna read some reviews of these sweatpants to see, how did people feel about them?' And there was, I think, over 2,000 reviews of the sweatpants. And I was really amazed to find that people had really strong opinions about these sweatpants, like people had really invested in the sweatpants. And what really struck me was that a lot of the people who were reviewing the sweatpants positively were also going through hard times in their lives. And actually I just felt kind of really heartened, despite myself, that like here were all these other people who were struggling a bit in life, but we were united by a sweatpant. Each of us putting one charcoal gray heather leg in front of the other.DB: Sweatpant nation.JHE: It was a sweatpant nation. I started thinking of them as my sweatpant brothers and sisters. So yeah, I ordered the sweatpants and they came and I think one person, one review said something like 'so...they're sweatpants.' And it was quite satisfying that that's exactly what I received. They were just a pair of sweatpants, they weren't fashionable, they weren't unfashionable, they weren't trying to be anything special. And that's what I needed at that sort of blank time in my life.So yeah, I started wearing them when I walked the dog and I pretty much wore them all the time when I wasn't going to work, and over time you know, it got warmer, I got over the relationship, things in my life improved and um, I didn't need the sweatpants as much anymore. (laughs)DB: Where are they now?JHE: I still have them. They're definitely like still in my drawer but they're no longer you know such an essential part of my wardrobe. But every time I see them I think of my sweatpants brothers and sisters and what a special time we had together.DB: Are they still the top-rated sweatpants on Amazon?JHE: No. They have sunk in the ratings.DB: What happened?JHE: I don't even know. But I think last time I looked they were around maybe number 60 or something like that. So—DB: To you, they're always number one.JHE: They'll always be number one. And I feel like it was kind of, you know, maybe they were only number one for five minutes on the day that I bought them, but that was when I needed them.DB: Did you end up leaving a review?JHE: Well Dan, of course I did.DB: What's your review?JHE: I'm happy to read it to you from the Amazon site where it's still posted: ""I bought these sweatpants as a defense against the time in my life when I was suffering from cold, of the literal and figurative kind. These sweatpants are shapeless. They're good for trudging. I wore them for some weeks to walk a dog. One morning I woke up and felt happier, and then I didn't need to wear the sweatpants every day anymore. But the time the sweatpants and I spent together was meaningful and important.DB: A version of Jean's story first appeared on the website Racked.Jean's also the author of the great new memoir, This Really Isn't About You.If you have a story about how a brand played a role in your life, call us at 7-3-1-3 BRANDS or email us at household name at businessinsider.com.CREDITSDB: To hear Household Name without ads, sign up for Stitcher Premium at stitcherpremium.com/householdname and use promo code HOUSEHOLD for your first month free.Please leave us a review and rating at Apple Podcasts.

73,/content/Bias_Incident_Lexis_1.DOCX,Newstex Blogs,2020-07-29,6025 words,,Financial Press,,Why are 'Karens' so angry? Videos of white women losing their cool and confronting Black people have taken social media by storm,False,"Jul 29, 2020( Financial Press: https://financialpress.com/ Delivered by Newstex) About four months ago, Terence Fitzgerald, and his two sons, who are 5 and 3 years old, were on a weekend bike ride in his neighborhood, a quiet suburb in Southern California with picturesque houses situated amid generous lawns.'My oldest loves nature and stopped all of a sudden,' Fitzgerald said. 'It forced us all to hit the brakes because he was leading us on our little adventure. He saw a cardinal and wanted to show me. The bird sat on a branch on the edge of someone's property.' 
It was one of those occasions a parent remembers: an ordinary moment when he and his family got to escape the rat race, pause and take a breath to enjoy the simple gifts of nature and fleeting childhood. Blink and that 5-year-old will be 15. Blink again, he'll be 25. ' 'All of a sudden a truck stopped. A white woman rolled down her window, and said, 'What's going on here? What are you looking at?'' ' — Terence Fitzgerald, who had stopped to observe a cardinal in a tree while cycling with his 5- and 3-year-old sons Alas, Fitzgerald remembers that day for another reason. 'All of a sudden, a truck stopped. A white woman rolled down her window and said, 'What's going on here? What are you looking at?' I felt this surge of anger rise within me,' he recalled. Fitzgerald, a clinical associate professor of social work at the University of Southern California and the author of 'Black Males and Racism: Improving the Schooling and Life Chances of African Americans,' said he was ready to use a tone of voice his children had never heard before. 'But I looked at my boys and realized that I am their role model and knew I had to control myself,' he says. 'I simply said in the smartest-ass way possible, 'A bird,'' he said. 'I gave them the death stare and the husband said, 'Well, all right then,' as if he was giving me permission to continue on my day. He rolled up their window and drove on. This neighborhood is my neighborhood.' For a moment, he wondered if he had made the wrong decision in moving there. 'There are maybe two other families of color here,' Fitzgerald said. 'I told my wife we should have never moved into a development with 'Plantation' in the name.' This is an all-too-familiar story of a white person 'policing' Black neighbors. 'Karens' and 'Kens' have been filmed on smartphones challenging people of color with increasing regularity: 'Why are you in this building? Do you live here?' Or even, 'You're not allowed to sell lemonade on this street!' Many say these videos, whether featuring Karens or Kens, shed light on racism and ongoing harassment of people of color by white people, sometimes even their neighbors. Meanwhile, some white feminists argue that the Karen video meme has gone too far, smacks of misogyny and aggressively shames women who are merely having a bad day. Research suggests Black people are mistreated based on their race more than white people. Some 65% of Black adults say they've been in situations where people acted suspicious of them, compared to just 25% of white adults, according to the Pew Research Center.[1] The Karen phenomenon can be roughly split into two groups: white people who confront and question people of color, and white people who show antipathy or rage toward authority — retail and restaurant workers who ask them to abide by social-distancing rules and wear face masks, for example — or ask to see the manager. A recent prominent example of the first category is Amy Cooper[2], who called the cops on May 25 — the same day George Floyd died in police custody, sparking Black Lives Matter protests — after Christian Cooper (no relation) asked her to put her dog on a leash in New York's Central Park. They are the neighborhood busybody who has a problem with their Black neighbors: Earlier this summer, Fareed Nassor Hayat and Norrinda Brown Hayat's neighbor in Montclair, N.J., called the police[3] demanding to see a permit because Hayat and her husband were building a patio in their backyard. 'This isn't just an argument between neighbors when she's using the power of the state. She's calling on the power of the state to say, 'Hey, I can have a knee on your neck if you don't submit to me,'' Fareed Hayat said after the incident. Several white neighbors came to the couple's defense, and the next day there was a protest in the neighborhood in support of the Hayats. Some harassment runs the gamut from legal residency and ethnicity to sexuality. Earlier this month, this woman[4] harassed a Latino gardener in California and, when he asked her to step back because she is not wearing a mask, she repeatedly said, 'Can you show me your papers?' She called him 'Mariposa,' Spanish slang for homosexual. He told her, 'I'm Mexican! I'm Filipino! I'm Chinese! You're funny. You made my day.' The other group of Karens and Kens featured in these viral memes and videos gets upset in public places when the rules don't bend to their will. They refuse to wear a face mask, charge store staff at the entrance[5], cough on other patrons, yank masks off the rack, or throw their baskets on the floor[6] or groceries out of their cart. In one particularly bizarre case, 'Costco Karen' COST, -0.28%[7] sat on the floor [8]of a Costco in Hillsboro, Ore., after declining to wear a mask. 'I'm an American. I have constitutional rights,' she said. After requesting to speak to the manager, she sat on the floor. A staff member politely asked her if she would like a chair. White women also call other white women 'Karen.' Take this recent trip to a hairdressers on Madison Avenue, as recounted by Gail, who asked to have her last name withheld. As she was paying her bill, Gail stood at the cash register next to a woman and her dog, who had been running around the salon without a leash. (The salon had a 'No Dogs' sign outside.) When asked to use her credit card, the woman refused to put it into the machine herself. 'I couldn't possibly do that! I have four assistants,' she said, according to Gail's account. 'My assistants do that for me.' The woman also complained about having to social distance and wear a mask. But Gail seemed excited tell the story. 'Is she a Karen? I think I met a Karen!' Racial animosity and economic disenfranchisementWhile white women have been filmed for vehemently refusing to wear masks during the pandemic, Black men have even been targeted in stores for wearing them. In May, Kam Buckner, a member of the Illinois state legislature, was stopped by police after leaving a store while wearing a mask. Buckner told a local news station[9]: When it was clear he had bought the items in his possession, the uniformed officer in question told him, 'People are using the coronavirus to do bad things. I couldn't see your face, man. You looked like you were up to something.' It was ironic, given the resistance among some white people to wearing face coverings. 'I have been programmed to show as much of my face as possible and use certain cues to disarm anyone who might have a learned inclination to be suspicious of my very presence,' Buckner said. ' 'People are using the coronavirus to do bad things. I couldn't see your face, man. You looked like you were up to something.' ' — Kam Buckner, a member of the state legislature in Illinois, recounting what a police officer reportedly told him when he walked out of a store wearing a face mask 'It is an indictment on the whole of society for creating a climate where this is normal and this is OK,' he added. 'I can't help but think of the dangers that are inherent for a number of Black men who are just adhering to the mask rule and, by doing so, look like they are 'up to something.'' In a paper published in the Michigan Journal of Race &#38; Law last year, Chan Tov McNamarah documented a 'legion' of white people calling the police on Black people 'engaged in mundane activities' during the summer of 2018. The article[10], 'White Caller Crime: Racialized Police Communication and Existing While Black,' chronicles a litany of such instances ranging from sitting in Starbucks[11] SBUX, +4.91%[12] and playing golf to eating in university classrooms. But explaining why a Karen or Ken questions Black people who are simply trying to go about their day is an attempt to rationalize the irrational, said Linda Clemons[13], the CEO of Sisterpreneur, an organization aimed at empowering female entrepreneurs. 'Children are not born that way,' she said. 'It doesn't come from their core being. It comes from someone who is racist or biased.' These divisions go back generations, she adds: 'They are coming out of the woodwork. They were already there.' Clemons says she tells white-women friends to use their voices to speak up against Karens, Kens and white supremacy: 'Use your white privilege to form a human barrier.' That has worked in the past, albeit fleetingly, and with mixed results. Black and white farmworkers fought side-by-side for better working conditions and pay in the 1930s, with the help of the Southern Tenant Farmers' Union, a federation of tenant farmers, to push for reform of the rights, and the working conditions and pay of sharecroppers and tenant farmers. 'Women played a critical role in its organization and administration,' according to the Central Arkansas Library System Encyclopedia of Arkansas. But politics and government policies got in the way. Laws and practices in the former Confederate states — such as poll taxes, literacy tests and 'grandfather clauses' — were introduced to prevent Black people from voting, creating a two-tiered system among the Black and white workers. Clemons sees the current social climate in the broader historical context of Black workers being scapegoated for white Americans' economic ills and personal misfortunes, after being exploited as free labor for generations. 'The White House was built off [the labor of] slavery and [on] Native Americans' stolen land,' she said. White allies have always been there too — perhaps not in the numbers seen so publicly since the civil-rights protests of 1968, Clemons said. But the most recent Black Lives Matter protests spurred by the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor[14] and many other unarmed Black people at the hands of police have galvanized a new generation of white allies, she added. The most recent spate of videos featuring white people confronting African Americans for innocuous reasons comes at a particularly polarizing time in American life, as Black Lives Matter protests sweep the country.

President Donald Trump has long identified his white, blue-collar base as 'the forgotten people,' those who feel they've been left behind. Globalization and technological advancement have hit manufacturing jobs in many of the pivotal states won by Trump in 2016. 'The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer,' Trump said in his election-night victory speech. The president-elect may have been paying uncredited homage to a 1932 speech by President Franklin D. Roosevelt that vowed help for 'the forgotten man at the bottom of the economic pyramid.' Given the resentments aired in Karen and Ken videos, they appear to be divided along political lines. FDR's New Deal in 1933 provided federal support to African-Americans and, by the mid-1930s, most had cut historical ties with Republican Party. ' Furloughs, layoffs, the stress of lockdowns and re-emergence of Black Lives Matter has left many Karens and Kens feeling insecure and threatened. ' Facing discriminatory labor laws and practices, they threw their support behind Roosevelt and joined with labor unions, farmers and progressives. FDR's 1936 reelection in a landslide shifted the balance of power in the Democratic Party from its Southern bloc of white conservatives to a more diverse field. The most recent spate of videos featuring white people confronting Black people for the most innocuous reasons — and seeing red when they're asked to socially distance by a store employee — comes at another polarizing time in American life, as Black Lives Matter protests sweep the country. Lillian Glass, a Los Angeles-based communications and body-language expert and author of 'Toxic People: 10 Ways of Dealing With People Who Make Your Life Miserable,' says the rage displayed in these videos is displaced, and likely originates with a combination of multiple other personal and financial problems. Furloughs, layoffs, the stress of lockdowns and the re-emergence of the Black Lives Matter movement has left many Karens and Kens feeling insecure and threatened, Glass observes. 'It's like the perfect storm,' she said. Fitzgerald, the USC social-work professor, contends fear fuels their fire: 'People who have historically lived in a place of privilege and safety are being told a couple of jarring things that have shaken them to their core,' he said. 'They are not safe. There is a new social-justice power pushing them to look in the mirror.' 'They are being told that the supposed fake media and the misguided liberals are to blame for the current state of social and economic turmoil,' he adds. 'These in fact are the same people, along with people of color, who are challenging their long-held beliefs of white superiority.' To Aram Sinnreich, an associate professor of communication at American University in Washington, D.C., 'the more interesting dimension of this is the question of who is getting angry about masks.' Or put another way: Why are these people refusing to abide by store rules nearly always white? 'Let's assume that almost everyone is feeling an unusual level of anxiety with a pandemic, record unemployment, political and social instability, and climate change,' Sinnreich said. 'Why do some people feel empowered and entitled to act on this anxiety by publicly defying mask-wearing regulations?' 'White people in this country are less accustomed than people of color to having their public behavior subject to regulation, scrutiny and critique,' Sinnreich added. 'That's the purpose of whiteness, after all. So the enforcement of rules like this may come as more of a shock.' It's easier for some Americans than others to let loose, and break mandatory mask rules, he said. 'White people feel safer acting antisocially in public because there is less of a pervasive threat of injury or death as a result, he said, whereas 'a Black person can get killed for jogging[15] or for opening their front door[16].' Names have been used to refer to such individuals, mostly to allow for alliteration, #PermitPatti, who refused to accept that a Black family was allowed into a neighborhood pool, and #BBQBecky. Source: MarketWatch photo illustration/iStockphoto The cultural history behind the name 'Karen'The phenomenon has jumped from the social-media peanut gallery to the halls of power. Calling 911 to report a fabricated, racially-biased emergency would be illegal in San Francisco under a proposal introduced earlier this month called, appropriately enough, the CAREN Act. 'This is the CAREN we need. Caution Against Racially Exploitative Non-Emergencies,' San Francisco Supervisor Shamann Walton tweeted. You may wonder why these videos' subjects are called Karen. The name's popularity peaked in the mid-1960s, and given the demographics of the U.S. 60 years ago, one theory is that people named Karen are now mostly middle-aged and white. The apparent genesis of the name's pejoration was a low-key and, likely, sexist viral post some years back joking that there's no such thing as a youthful Karen — that Karens arrive on the scene fully formed, grasping onto anti-vax conspiracy theories and usually demanding to see the manager. There is some agreement that the name Karen is associated with white women. Karen Attiah wrote in the Washington Post[17] that, as a kid in South Dallas in the 1990s, she introduced herself to other Black kids at the mall. 'One of them raised an eyebrow and looked puzzled when I told him my name. 'You don't look like a Karen,' he said. 'That's a white lady's name.'' ' 'White people in this country are less accustomed than people of color to having their public behavior subject to regulation, scrutiny, and critique.' ' — Aram Sinnreich, an associate professor of communication at American University in Washington, D.C. 'My mother, who grew up in Nigeria, named me Karen precisely because she wanted me to blend into white American society and face fewer problems in life than I would have with a foreign or a 'black-sounding' name,' Attiah wrote. 'Being a Karen has probably given me some advantages.' This is not the first time arrogant white people have been given such sobriquets. In the 19th century, African Americans called condescending white men and women, as well as slave owners and their wives, Mister Charlies and Miss Anns. It was a covert and safer way of discussing their behavior. In fact, James Baldwin wrote a 1964 play titled 'Blues for Mister Charlie.' It was loosely based on the case of Emmett Till, the 14-year-old African-American from Chicago who was lynched in Mississippi in 1955 after he was accused of offending a white woman, Carolyn Bryant, in her parents' grocery store. Bryant recanted that accusation decades after Till's murder. Even some white suffragettes have been identified as having Karen-esque tendencies. 'In America, both the women's-rights movement and the black-rights movement had their roots in the abolitionist organizations of the early 1800s, and they shared many members, goals and methods,' according to 'On Account of Color and Sex,' a extensive analysis of that period by historian Whitney Sampson. That all changed. 'By the late 1860s, the leaders of the two movements disagreed completely on the relationship between their movement and the existing political structure, particularly the Republican Party,' she added. 'They also held divergent opinions on why other women or Black people need to vote, and when enfranchisement should occur.' Anna Howard Shaw, a white suffragette, turned her back on her Black compatriots in the movement. 'You have put the ballot in the hands of your black men, thus making them political superiors of white women,' she said. 'Never before in the history of the world have men made former slaves the political masters of their former mistresses.' In recent times, other names have been used to refer to such individuals, mostly to allow for alliteration — #PermitPatti, who refused to accept that a Black family was allowed into a neighborhood pool, and #BBQBecky, who called the police on a Black family having a barbecue. Pop culture has made some names stick: Sir-Mix-A-Lot's 'Baby Got Back' in 1992 featured a 'Becky' who sounded like a stereotypical Valley Girl, while 'Karen' surfaced in Dane Cook's 2005 stand-up routine 'The Friend Nobody Likes[18].' 'Every group has a Karen ' Cook said. (To be fair to Cook, he also said his friend group had such a person named Brian.) Whether they're called Karen and Ken or Becky and Brian, social commentators say the names provide a handle on behaviors born of entitlement, privilege or disenfranchisement and/or rage. Such run-ins with Karens and Kens are not always — explicitly, at least — related to race. Some social commentators say the virality of Karen videos ignores the reality that people of color deal with being policed by white women and men. Pictured: The Women's March Los Angeles in January 2018. Source: Getty Images Is the virality of Karen videos misogynistic?Karens and Kens are, one might assume, equally angry with their perception of the state of the world. But while videos of people losing their cool in stores and on airplanes feature both men and women, Karens make the news[19] more often than Kens. People also appear to choose to film and/or share Karens on Twitter, Facebook FB, +0.98%[20] and Instagram. These videos are disturbing and chilling, but also mesmerizing and fascinating — they can rack up tens of millions of views online. Fitzgerald says the virality of Karen videos ignores the reality that people of color deal with being policed by white women and men, and are effectively told they're occupying what they regard as their space. 'As people of color, we have equal negative experiences with both,' he said. So why do videos of Karens get more clicks than those featuring men? Because these scenes take place in clothing stores and supermarkets, places where women still go more than men? Is it related to the toxic myth of female hysteria[21] that still permeates society, whether at the workplace or the doctor's office? Or is it a twisted fascination with seeing women 'misbehave' in the context of 'good girl' and 'ladylike' patriarchal stereotypes? ' Karens, arguably, are no angrier than their male counterparts. On Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, we see their anger more than Kens because people choose to film and/or share them. ' 'Recently, the meaning of 'Karen' was said to refer specifically to middle-class, middle-aged white women who are so entitled they ask to speak to the manager when perturbed, but has since morphed into a specifically racist white woman, who 'weaponizes' white, female fragility against largely black men,' Meghan Murphy, the founder and editor of the Feminist Current magazine, wrote in a recent edition.[22] She believes that the Karen memes and videos have 'officially gone too far.' Murphy wrote: 'This connects to sexist tropes that claim women use their emotions, vulnerability, and tears to manipulate men.' '#8216;Becky,' which originated as a means to refer to basic white women — the Uggs-wearing, Starbucks-buying SBUX, +4.91%[23], pumpkin spice-loving kind — [is] probably young, probably blonde, probably not working class,' Murphy wrote. 'Like 'Karen,' I never found this to be particularly offensive, as I had little desire to defend boring people who love Starbucks, but what was once a joke has become something much more egregious.' She cites, as one of many examples, a male driver who identified a woman he described as a 'Karen' and 'then followed her home and filmed her as she melted down into hysterics, posting the video online.' Her 'crime'? She flipped him off. The man who filmed the video, who is Black and gay and in his 20s, describes himself on his own website as 'more than a viral video star.' The man included her license plate in his video. It has been viewed more than 11 million times, and he is now selling T-shirts online based on the incident. It makes for uncomfortable viewing. The woman tells him to leave her alone. She cowers at the back of her car, attempting to hide her license plate. She screams about what is perhaps now regarded as the ultimate way to bring instant infamy to a white woman who makes a mistake or loses her cool in public: 'He wants to call me a Karen and put me online!' In a statement, Twitter said it doesn't consider car license plates to be private information under its private-information policy and, while the apartment complex is visible in that video, there isn't a visible address, so it's not something it would take enforcement action on. The company declined to comment on the alleged harassment of this woman in the video. Many such videos lack context, and we often don't get to see what happened immediately before the video started, Murphy said. 'We all know social media leaves little room for nuance, and far too many people enjoy a rage reaction over asking questions or considering they may not know the full story,' she said. 'The truth is that, today, people's lives can be destroyed in an instant, via a viral post. And our culture is wielding that power with very little care.' ' 'This dual oppressor/oppressed identity often becomes a root of tension when white women are challenged to consider their white privilege by women of color.' ' — Mamta Motwani Accapadi, who works in higher-education administration, writing in her study, 'When White Women Cry' Some who see the Karen and Ken videos and memes as necessary and revealing do acknowledge the sexist element of focusing on white women over white men. 'We live in a sexist society, so of course any kind of public shaming will have a gendered element,' Sinnreich said. Men and women express violence differently, he added. 'Men may be more likely to start a physical altercation, to engage in domestic abuse[24] or to vandalize property. It may be that calling the perpetrators of these incidents by the gendered term Karen is a tacit acknowledgment that the form of 'acting out' they are engaging in is one that is more frequently designated as an appropriate or expected form of anti-sociality for women.' 'The locale may be part of that,' Sinnreich added, 'but so may be the nature of the acting out, such as disrupting normal business processes (checkout lines) and delegating violence by proxy to institutions (calling the cops on a bird-watcher who asks you to leash your dog).' In her seminal article, 'When White Women Cry[25],' semantics scholar Mamta Motwani Accapadi examined the complex relationship to social justice and diversity between white and Black women. She examined awkward moments between Black and white women at workplaces and educational institutions. What she found: 'This dual oppressor/oppressed identity often becomes a root of tension when white women are challenged to consider their white privilege by women of color.' That is to say, such conversations between white and Black colleagues about race don't always go so well. She cited a case study involving 'Anita,' a woman of color, who raised a concern about the lack of support offered to her community from an office where 'Susan' worked. Susan began to cry and said she 'felt attacked.' Anita reassured Susan that her comments were not directed at her personally. Instead of discussing the issue of support or lack of diversity programs, the group spent its time consoling Susan. Susan later reported Anita to both of their respective managers. Stephanie Younger, an 18-year-old activist, says the Karen phenomenon is not misogynistic or sexist. In her essay for the Black Feminist Collective, 'The Backlash Against 'Karen' Memes Is Peak White Feminism[26],' she wrote, 'While white women have the privilege of being called a 'Karen' for enforcing oppression against marginalized people, Black women and girls are labeled as 'angry'' because of their race. 'White women, before you get defensive when we hold you accountable for weaponizing your privilege,' Younger wrote, 'remember that Black girls are the ones who are being erased and marginalized.' The Pride and Black Lives Matter movements last month in Washington, DC. The larger official Pride events were canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic but people still showed up to lend their support for the Black Lives Matter movement. Getty Images 'A problem which is not named cannot be solved'Karens, Kens, Beckys and Brians allow people to see racism and white privilege run wild. It makes most folks feel better about themselves — 'Thank God I'm not like that!' — and laugh at the absurdity of people trying to assert their own perceived power in a very public setting. But the most ingrained kinds of racism and white supremacy are neither amusing, nor so obvious. For example, both white and minority communities are struggling with coronavirus-induced job loss and concerns of getting sick, but people of color frequently experience discrimination in jobs[27], health care[28] and housing[29], the kind of systemic racism not so easily captured in a four-minute video. Indeed, some encounters with Karens and Kens can be less public displays of emotion and more cat-and-mouse. Lisa Alexander, the CEO of LaFace Skincare and now known as 'San Francisco Karen,' and her partner, Robert Larkins, walked up to a neighbor James Juanillo in June. They were not happy. Juanillo, who describes himself as a 'proud Filipino,' was writing 'Black Lives Matter' in yellow chalk on a gray retaining wall in the Pacific Heights area of San Francisco. With a veneer of chilly politeness, they told him that he was breaking the law. ' 'Women are judged for being emotional. We're considered to be difficult when we get angry, whereas men are perceived as being tough and powerful.' ' — Denise Dudley, author and workplace consultant Alexander asked[30]. 'Hi, is this your property? I'm asking you if this is your property.' When Juanillo suggested that they didn't know who lived there, Alexander raised her index finger to her chin apologetically, and said, 'We actually do know. That's why we're asking. Because we know the person who does live here.' There was one not-insignificant problem: Alexander was lying. Juanillo had lived in the property since 2002, and clearly decided to let the absurd and cringeworthy scenario play out. 'She was scarier than the other ones,' said Denise Dudley, a San Luis Obispo, Calif.-based author and workplace consultant. It was not clear why Alexander or Larkins assumed he did not own the property, nor why they would pretend that they were friends with the owner. But one theory as to why Alexander and Larkins approached Juanillo is that in a predominantly white, wealthy neighborhood like Pacific Heights — where the median-priced home is valued at $2 million, according to Zillow Z, +0.56%[31] — they incorrectly assumed that he did not live there. Feeling secure in that assumption, they clearly felt confident enough to lie and say they did know who lived in Juanillo's large home. Alexander released a statement after Juanillo's video went viral on Twitter TWTR, +1.25%[32], where it was viewed more than 23 million times. 'I want to apologize directly to Mr. Juanillo,' she wrote. 'There are not enough words to describe how truly sorry I am for being disrespectful to him.' She added: 'I should have minded my own business. The last 48 hours has taught me that my actions were those of someone who is not aware of the damage caused by being ignorant and naive to racial inequalities.' Nowhere in her apology did Alexander use the word 'racist' or 'racism.' One factor that may contribute to the fascination with Karen videos: 'Emotional expressions by women tend to come under greater scrutiny than those by men,' wrote the authors of 'Constrained by Emotion: Women, Leadership, and Expressing Emotion in the Workplace,' a chapter in the 2016 'Handbook on Well-Being of Working Women.' Women incur social and economic penalties for expressing stereotypical 'masculine' emotions because they threaten society's patriarchal barriers, researchers Jacqueline Smith, Victoria Brescoll and Erin Thomas wrote. Dudley said women, whether they are white or Black, are encouraged by society to withhold their anger, while men are encouraged to withhold their tears. 'Women are judged for being emotional,' she said. 'We're considered to be difficult when we get angry, whereas men are perceived as being tough and powerful.' Research has actually suggested that men who get angry are perceived as strong and decisive, while women are more often seen as hysterical. That, Dudley said, could go some way in explaining why Karens seem to trigger more social-media viewers than Kens. Whatever the underlying reasons why some white women and men are captured on video raging against mask mandates and people of color they meet on the street, Dudley says the moniker serves a useful purpose: It allows people to call out entitled, unacceptable behavior. McNamarah agrees. 'A problem which is not named cannot be solved. Violence which is neither acknowledged nor understood cannot be prevented. Hidden pain and undiagnosed injuries cannot be healed,' she concluded in her Michigan Journal of Race &#38; Law paper. In the most fortunate cases, social media is a powerful enough tool to bring a reckoning to those who are a public nuisance and/or call the cops on Black neighbors. It provides an important record of the event and often leads to a public backlash, worldwide opprobrium for the Karen or Ken in the video, and financial and professional repercussions for the busybody. Juanillo, while filming the testy exchange with 'San Francisco Karen,' managed to keep his cool and his sense of humor. As she walked away, he told his millions of future viewers: 'And that, people, is why Black lives matter. That's Karen, and she's calling the cops, and this is going to be really funny because she knows the people who live here. Personally.'The post Why are 'Karens' so angry? Videos of white women losing their cool and confronting Black people have taken social media by storm[33] appeared first on Financial Press[34].

74,/content/Bias_Incident_Lexis_1.DOCX,Congressional Documents and Publications,2020-06-22,10419 words,U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES DOCUMENTS,,,"House Education and Labor Committee Hearing; ""Inequities Exposed: How COVID-19 Widened Racial Inequities in Education, Health, and the Workforce.""; Testimony by John King, President and CEO, The Education Trust, Washington , D.C.",False,"Chairman Scott, Ranking Member Foxx, and members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify on racial equity and COVID-19.
This hearing takes place in the shadow of massive global protests against police violence seeking to ensure that ""Black Lives Matter"" is more than just a hashtag. The murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and Rayshard Brooks remind us yet again that systemic racism, anti-Blackness, and the legacy of slavery still infect our institutions, public discourse, and daily interactions. Now is the time to transform the lofty rhetoric of statements about solidarity into concrete action toward achieving justice.
Our education system is fraught with racial inequities that existed before COVID-19. Far too few Black and Latino children have access to affordable, high-quality preschool. Black children, especially Black boys, are disproportionately suspended and expelled from early learning programs. The pandemic has pushed our early childhood education sector toward collapse, which could have dire consequences for families of color and an early childhood workforce disproportionately made up of women of color.
Over 65 years after Brown v. Board of Education, district lines and school assignment policies still segregate K-12 students by race and class. Districts with the most Black, Latino, and Native American students spend almost $2,000 less per student per year than districts with mostly White students. Students of color are less likely to be assigned to the strongest teachers, less likely to have access to school counselors, less likely to be enrolled in advanced coursework, and more likely to be subjected to exclusionary discipline. These opportunity gaps in turn generate gaps in learning, high school graduation, and college matriculation.
The higher education sector still doesn't reflect America's diversity: Not one state's public colleges enroll or graduate a representative share of Black and Latino students relative to the state population. Meanwhile, the burden of student debt falls disproportionately on Black students, who are more likely than their White peers to have to borrow and also more likely to default.
COVID-19 has exacerbated these educational disparities. During the necessary school closures, Black, Latino, and Native American students disproportionately had less access to devices and home internet service; teachers with less support to execute online learning; parents unable to telework and assist with schoolwork; and more socioemotional stressors. As noted in my recent Senate HELP Committee testimony: ""Our nation's students of color and their families find themselves enduring a pandemic that disproportionately impacts their health and safety, mired in an economic crisis that disproportionately affects their financial well-being, and living in a country that too often still struggles to recognize their humanity.""
In response, we urge Congress to take the following actions:
First: Congress must act boldly to support and strengthen P-12 education.
To address devastating budget shortfalls, over 70 stakeholders have called on Congress to allocate at least $500 billion for state and local governments, including at least $175 billion for K-12 education, and $50 billion for higher education. This federal stabilization funding must include a strong maintenance of effort provision, and add a maintenance of equity provision so states and districts can ensure that the most vulnerable students retain critical supports. Congress must allocate dedicated funding for broadband expansion to enable distance learning for millions of low-income students, for extended learning time to tackle the significant learning loss resulting from the pandemic, and for resources to address students' and educators' nutritional, social, emotional, and mental health needs. Congress should refrain from permitting blanket waivers to key civil rights laws like ESSA and IDEA, and protect the historic interpretation of the Title I equitable services provision in administering the CARES Act and future funds. Additionally, the federal government must promote diverse schools, require data to be disaggregated by race, and uphold students' civil rights.
Second: Congress must enact equitable reforms to higher education.
Congress should extend the student loan relief provisions included in the CARES Act into next year and offer equitable, targeted debt forgiveness in recognition that the recession will make repaying student debt impossible for millions of borrowers. To counter widespread losses of financial assistance and employment, which may keep millions of students from enrolling or staying enrolled, Congress should double the Pell Grant and simplify the FAFSA process.
Implementing those policies would increase enrollment and limit debt for students of color, but there is more Congress can do, including: expanding Pell access to incarcerated students and undocumented students, increasing investments in HBCUs and MSIs, supporting diversity in educator preparation programs, investing in evidence-based strategies to improve outcomes for low-income students and students of color, reigning in predatory for-profit institutions, and collecting better data to monitor progress. Finally, the federal government should never waver in its commitment to protect the civil rights and safety of all students.
The racial inequities we face in education are significant, but not insurmountable. The Education Trust stands ready to assist you in the work ahead.
Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today. I look forward to taking your questions.
Chairman Scott, Ranking Member Foxx, and members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify on the structural racial inequities in our nation's educational systems that are being exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and how best to address them going forward.
As I had the opportunity to share with the Senate HELP Committee earlier this month, this hearing takes place in the shadow of massive demonstrations across the globe by millions protesting the continued toll of systemic racism in America. The murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and Rayshard Brooks remind us that the legacies of slavery and Jim Crow, racial discrimination, and anti-Blackness still infect many of our institutions, our public discourse, and our daily interactions. Students of color, their families, and millions of others are risking their own lives amid an ongoing public health crisis to ensure that ""Black Lives Matter"" is more than just a hashtag. Now is the time to transform the lofty rhetoric of solidarity into concrete action toward achieving educational justice.
Our nation's education system is fraught with racial inequities, some of which manifest before students of color even enter kindergarten. Young children of color face particularly challenging barriers to high-quality early care and education, while disproportionately living in poverty. Infant care can cost up to 116% of a low-income family's total income, yet far too few families receive financial assistance to access it: for instance, Early Head Start provides access to only 7% of eligible infants and toddlers. Child care subsidies through the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) serve a very small portion of potentially federally eligible children of color: only 15% of Black children and 6% of Latino children. Accessing any type of child care is challenging for many families of color: 57% of Latino families and 60% of American Indian and Alaskan Native families live in child care deserts. And when states do fund high-quality preschool programs, access is often lower for Black and Latino children, who are underrepresented in several such programs. Young children of color who do have access to early childhood education are pushed out of the classroom at alarming rates: Black children, and especially Black boys, are disproportionately suspended and expelled from early learning settings. The COVID-19 crisis has compounded these inequities, and has pushed early care and learning toward collapse, which has potentially deleterious consequences for families of color with young children and an early childhood workforce disproportionately made up of women of color.
As students enter our K-12 systems, the inequities persist. School districts with the most Black, Latino, and Native American students receive roughly $1,800, or 13%, less per student in state and local funding than those serving mostly White students. Students of color and students from low-income backgrounds are less likely to have access to strong, consistent teaching than their White and higher-income peers. Furthermore, only 20 percent of teachers are teachers of color compared to half of all students in the United States being students of color. Beyond ensuring that the teacher workforce is representative of the country, there are proven benefits of having a diverse teacher workforce. Students of color who have had teachers of the same race do better academically and are more likely to graduate from high school and attend a four-year college. Research suggests that Black teachers are also more likely than White teachers to have high expectations for Black students, and less likely to use exclusionary discipline on them. Furthermore, schools staffed by leaders and teachers of color expose all students to positive role models of different races, and counteract negative stereotypes.
In 38 states, the schools that serve more students of color and students from low-income backgrounds have fewer counselors per student than schools that serve fewer of these students, which puts underrepresented students at a disadvantage when social, emotional, and academic supports are needed beyond the classroom. Additionally, despite studies showing that Black students do not misbehave more than other students, Black students are disproportionately suspended, expelled and arrested at school. According to the Civil Rights Data Collection, Black students comprise only 15% of school enrollment, but account for 40% of students who receive an out-of-school suspension, 35% of those expelled, and 36% of students who were arrested at school.
Racial disparities exist in relation to coursework, as well. Based on The Education Trust's analysis of data from the Civil Rights Data Collection and the Common Core of Data, Black and Latino students are locked out of advanced coursework at every critical stage of their education - they are denied these opportunities in elementary school, middle school and high school. We know students of color can be and are successful in eighth grade Algebra I courses, yet students who attend schools with the lowest percentages of students of color are about 1.5 times as likely to be enrolled in eighth grade algebra as students attending schools with the highest percentages of students of color.
Given these inequities in opportunity and access, it is not surprising that we see different outcomes when we look at measures of student learning and graduation rates. On the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), Black and Latino students are more likely to score at the basic and below basic levels than their White peers. For example, in 2019, 18% of students from low-income backgrounds, 14% of Black students, and 20% of Latino students scored at or above proficient on the eighth grade math assessment, compared to 48% and 44% of their non-low-income and White peers, respectively. We also see smaller percentages of students who are Black, Latino, Indigenous, or from low-income backgrounds, and students with disabilities graduating from high school compared to their peers. While the overall graduation rate for the class of 2017-18 was 85.3%, it was lower for Black students (79%), Native American students (73.5%), students from low-income backgrounds (79.5%), and students with disabilities (67.1%).
As students of color transition into postsecondary education, they move into a public college system that doesn't reflect America's diversity: Not one state's public colleges enroll or graduate a representative share of Black and Latino students relative to state population.
In fact, since 2000, the percentage of Black students has decreased at nearly 60% of the 101 most selective public colleges and universities in the United States. Fewer than 1 in 10 of these colleges (9%) enrolls a percentage of Black students on campus that is proportional to the Black population of the state in which they reside. Since 2000, the growth of Latino enrollment at 65% of these institutions failed to keep pace with the growth in the state's Latino population. And only 1 in 7 of these colleges (14%) has a percentage of Latino students that is representative of their state's Latino population.
Once enrolled, the chance of completing college also differs for White and Black students, even within the same income group. At four-year institutions, White students are at least 11 percentage points more likely to complete a college degree than their Black counterparts, regardless of income group. The completion gaps are wide among low, lower middle, and upper middle income groups, but this discrepancy was the largest in the lower middle income group. White students were 17 percentage points more likely to graduate than their Black counterparts (67% vs. 50%), while among students from families with the highest incomes, the completion gap was considerable but somewhat smaller (11 percentage points).
And the racial disparities don't end there. Black students are vastly underrepresented in higher education, yet those that do attend college often bear a disproportionate student debt burden. Black students are more likely to borrow and default on their loans than their White peers. For federal loans, default occurs after a borrower is 270 days late and it is the most disastrous financial outcome of student debt. Defaulting not only ruins a person's credit, but makes future borrowing more expensive and can make it harder to get a job, rent an apartment, or buy a house or a car. Half of Black borrowers who entered college in the 2003-04 academic year defaulted on their student loans within 12 years, a staggeringly high number when compared to the nationwide default rate of 10%. Protective factors like degree completion or high family income, which would normally shield borrowers from adverse debt outcomes, don't necessarily protect Black borrowers. A Black bachelor's degree recipient is more likely to default than a White college dropout, and Black students from high-income families default at rates that are seven times higher than their White peers. Higher default rates among Black borrowers are not the result of over-borrowing or poor decisions, but are caused by structural racism that harms Black people financially and perpetuates the racial wealth gap.
These inequities are compounded by racial disparities in the labor market, where the Black unemployment rate is consistently double that of their White counterparts. Regardless of education level, the same racial disparities in employment persist: In May 2020, White bachelor's degree holders had lower unemployment rates than Black, Hispanic or Latino, and Asian American bachelor's degree holders. This structural disadvantage is a key contributor to the overall financial insecurity and inability to build intergenerational wealth among communities of color: Today's median Black family has a net wealth of $3,600, while the median Latino family has a net wealth of $6,600, compared to $147,000 for the median White family. The racial wealth gap is a product of slavery, Jim Crow, and racist federal housing policy. Combined with ongoing discrimination in employment and lending, these systemic barriers have effectively prevented many Black families from building wealth through homeownership, leaving them with a fraction of the wealth of White people.
The grim reality is that COVID-19 has made the inequities present in our education system, like those detailed above, even worse.
From its onset, the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored that not all adults have the privilege of working from home in accordance with states' social distancing or stay-at-home orders, and that those who are deemed ""essential"" and are required to place themselves at risk are disproportionately individuals of color or those from working-class, low-income backgrounds. Only about 1 in 5 Black workers and 1 in 6 Latino workers are able to work from home, compared with about 1 in 3 White workers. Research shows that predominantly Black counties account for over half of coronavirus cases in the United States, and nearly 60% of total deaths. It also shows that social determinants -- including employment, access to health insurance and medical care, and poor air and water quality -- are more predictive of infection and death from COVID-19 than are underlying health conditions. In Chicago, while Black residents are about 30% of the city's population, they account for nearly 70% of COVID-19 deaths. Stunningly, as of June 10, 1 in every 1,625 Black Americans has died from COVID-19, compared to 1 in 3,800 White Americans. Even more recent Centers for Disease Control data shows that a disproportionate number of Latinos are suffering from COVID-19 relative to their share of the U.S. population. In nearby Anne
Arundel County, Maryland, Latino residents account for 38% of all cases, despite only making up 8% of that county's population.
The economic toll on communities of color has been substantial. A new Associated Press poll finds that over 60% of Hispanic Americans say they have experienced some form of household income loss as a result of the pandemic, including job losses, unpaid leave, cuts in pay, and fewer scheduled hours compared with 46% of Americans overall. While 37% of Hispanic Americans and 27% of Black Americans say they've been unable to pay at least one type of bill as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, only 17% of White Americans say the same. A recent poll indicated that Latino and Black workers were more likely to be laid off due to the pandemic than their White peers, and that people of color who remain employed are more worried about losing their jobs.
The inequities impacting how Americans of different races, ethnicities, and incomes are experiencing the pandemic translate to educational inequities as well. Across the nation, schools are struggling to move to distance learning, as are teachers and administrators who may not have familiarity with learning management technology tools. Parents and educators alike are searching for promising practices and online learning resources, and many schools and districts lack large-scale experience with education technology. This spring, we also saw many high school students take at-home versions of Advanced Placement tests, which are often a factor in college admissions, despite not every student having the same access to an AP course or test. Additionally, not every student has a compatible device or access to high-speed internet to make online learning viable. As a result, a recent survey of teachers noted that student learning since schools closed has dropped to three hours a day, from six previously, and that lower-income students were down to two hours a day. Earlier in the pandemic, Los Angeles reported that about a third of its high school students were not logging in for classes. In states where schools remain closed for months or even longer, learning loss among students, particularly those who are already vulnerable, may carry far into the future, unless directly addressed through expanded learning opportunities.
Confronted with the uncertainty about the nature of COVID-19 and how long it may prevent the full resumption of in-person learning, parents and families are understandably concerned not only about their children's health and well-being, but also about their children's education at this unprecedented time. The Education Trust just conducted polls of parents in New York, Washington, Texas, and California. These polls show that nearly 90% of parents are worried that their children will fall behind academically because of school closings. Equity concerns about distance education seem particularly valid when we know that before the pandemic, 79% of White households had broadband access, while only 66% of Black families and 61% of Hispanic families had broadband service at home.
The Education Trust is grateful that many educators across the country have made one important shift during this crisis -- showing their students even more clearly that they care by asking about students' well-being and connecting families with resources to provide some levity through fun virtual interactions with their students. This relationship-building between teachers and students was already happening in many places, but it was not happening nearly enough in places that serve a majority of students of color and students from low-income backgrounds. That connection is essential. In addition, Ed Trust's parent poll in New York revealed that 95% of parents want to have regular contact with or access to their child's teacher, but only 52% said their child's school has made that available. Our California poll revealed that Black parents were less likely than parents of all other racial groups to have been contacted by their child's teacher. We need to make sure this is something that is cherished in places where students face the most obstacles.
The pandemic also has had detrimental effects on college students forced to leave their campuses and return home to learn remotely, and especially on those who were working while enrolled and have lost income that's essential to continuing their education. The impact of the pandemic can also be seen in the disaggregated data showing which groups of students are worried about being able to graduate on time, and considering delaying or changing their education plans. Roughly three-quarters of undergraduate students have said they were worried about being able to stay on track and graduate, and those shares were higher among Black and Latino students. Another survey showed that 32% of Latino students, 24% of Black students, and 21% of Asian American students have canceled or delayed their education plans in light of the pandemic. College students are also impacted by the digital divide, as they return to homes that may not have reliable broadband access. Black and Latino students are also overrepresented within the population of students that were denied emergency financial aid by Secretary Betsy DeVos' interpretation of the CARES Act: undocumented students, incarcerated students, and students who have defaulted on their loans. All of these pressures take a toll on students' mental health: 80% said that the pandemic had negatively affected their mental health.
As noted in our Senate testimony earlier this month, our nation's students of color and their families find themselves enduring a pandemic that disproportionately impacts their health and safety, mired in an economic crisis that disproportionately affects their financial well-being, and living in a country that too often still struggles to recognize their humanity.
In response to these racial inequities, which have only grown in the wake of this pandemic, we urge Congress to take the following actions:
How Congress Can Act Boldly to Support and Strengthen P-12 Education in the Midst of COVID-19
Allocate Funds to Allow for Safe Reopening, Relief for Students, and Enable Learning to Continue
The first step toward making the system more equitable is to prevent the pandemic from making that task even harder. States and localities -- which provide the vast majority of K-12 education funding -- are bracing for major budget cuts as revenues continue to plummet. After the Great Recession of 2008, over 300,000 educators lost their jobs, and inflation adjusted state funding per pupil was still lower in 2017 than 2008. This time the cuts may be even larger. If we ignore the lessons of the last economic slowdown, students of color and students from low-income backgrounds will be hardest hit by these cuts. For example, while funding cuts to education were widespread following the Great Recession, an analysis of layoffs in Los Angeles found that Latino elementary students were 26% more likely than their White peers to have their teacher laid off; Black elementary students 72% more likely to have their teacher laid off.
The National Education Association projects that the United States could lose as many as 1.9 million education jobs if Congress doesn't extend financial relief to states and localities, and nearly half a million K-12 education jobs disappeared in April alone. The Learning Policy Institute estimates, based on projected state revenue losses for the end of this fiscal year and the next, that K-12 systems might need as much as $230 billion to stabilize their budgets. And those estimates are focused solely on making districts whole; they do not incorporate the additional costs that districts will face as a direct result of responding to COVID-19, including sanitizing schools, personal protective equipment, and providing devices and materials for distance/hybrid learning.
This is why over 70 education stakeholders have called on Congress to allocate at least $500 billion for state and local stabilization, and require that a proportional amount of these funds be directed toward K-12 spending. As K-12 education makes up, on average, 35% of state general funds, Congress should allocate at least $175 billion for K-12 education. An investment of this size is essential to, at minimum, prevent the K-12 education system in America from becoming more inequitable in the wake of the pandemic.
These targeted federal stabilization funds, as well as the additional provisions outlined below, are necessary to ensure that schools are able to reopen safely and that states and districts are able to provide all schools -- particularly underfunded, high-poverty schools that serve more students of color -- with the resources they need to implement the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) considerations and each local health authority's guidance for keeping students and staff safe (e.g., adequate testing and contact tracing, use of PPE, protections for at-risk staff and students, social distancing, etc.). The funds will also be essential to maintain the nation's education workforce and implement equitable policies to the benefit of all students.
Ensure States and Districts Do Not Walk Away From the Students Hit Hardest by This Crisis
While the federal government must provide financial assistance to address looming revenue shortfalls and budget cuts, states and school districts remain the primary actors in funding local education systems and deciding how equitably that funding is used. Federal stabilization money must be accompanied by strong requirements to ensure that states maintain their investments in education; to ensure that states and districts minimize cuts to their highest need districts and schools; and to prevent the U.S. Department of Education (ED) from steering funding away from low-income, public school students.
Specifically, the federal government must include maintenance of effort provisions that require state education spending levels to remain constant (i.e., at least at the same percentage of the state's total spending), even if the state's overall budget shrinks. Further, if spending cuts are necessary, the federal government must use a maintenance of equity provision to protect our highest-need schools by requiring both states and districts that receive additional federal funding to show that any necessary cuts are smaller per student in the highest-need districts and schools than the rest of the state or district.
Finally, we've already seen ED advise states and school districts to steer federal funding away from low-income, public school students into the hands of wealthier, Whiter private schools. Therefore, we urge Congress to prevent forthcoming regulations that would allow the Department of Education's recent misinterpretation of the Title I equitable services provision within the CARES Act to be used to direct over $1.35 billion in CARES Act financial assistance away from public Title I schools primarily serving
Black and Latino students to private schools that primarily serve White students, regardless of whether those schools are serving students from low-income backgrounds. Several states have already rejected this approach.
Ensure That Distance Learning is Possible for Every Student
Before the pandemic, 79% of White households had broadband access, while only 66% of Black families and 61 % of Hispanic families had broadband service at home. More than one-third of all households with school-age children and incomes of less than $30,000 annually lack high-speed internet access. Additionally, Microsoft estimates that as many as 163 million people do not use the internet at broadband speeds, burdening students even further.
It is likely that distance learning will continue through the summer, into the beginning of next year, and intermittently if new cases of the virus emerge. The data we have from this spring is alarming. For example, data from California showed that 38% of low-income families and 29% of families of color are concerned about access to distance learning because they don't have reliable internet at home. Therefore, states and districts must have a plan in place to ensure that all students, including students from low-income backgrounds, have access to reliable, high-speed internet and devices and IT support to connect to virtual learning opportunities, and that educators have the support they need to effectively teach, assess, and connect with their students remotely. The lack of equitable access to broadband is not only a distance learning issue, but also an emergency preparedness issue in the event of further widespread closures.
Congress must allocate at least $4 billion through an Emergency Connectivity Fund via the Federal Communications Commission's federal E-Rate program to expand access to broadband services, Wi-Fi hotspots, and devices to ensure that all students have the ability to access online learning at home in the event of continued disruptions, and Congress should encourage districts to implement multilingual digital learning platforms to be fully inclusive. Congress should also encourage private companies to enable home broadband access for the students in the communities they serve at no cost during the pandemic.
Beyond the emergency response to ensure access during the pandemic, Congress should be looking at what it would take to ensure that the homework gap that affects at least 8 million K-12 students annually is closed for good. The same racial inequities in high-speed home Internet access exacerbated by the crisis will be present beyond it. America needs a national policy that recognizes that the Internet is an essential tool in continuing education outside of the classroom, both formally and informally, and that it is increasingly obvious that part of solving the racial inequities in education is solving the homework gap.
Address Learning Loss Through Expanded Learning Opportunities
Students will likely return to classrooms with significant learning loss, which schools and teachers must be prepared to assess and address. Schools serving larger populations of students from low-income backgrounds are far less likely to be able to provide online learning opportunities for all students and, therefore, must find a way to make up for lost instructional time. In fact, an analysis done by McKinsey indicated that the average lost learning time for Black students due to the pandemic could be as much as 10 months; for Hispanic students, as much nine months; and for low-income students, over a year.
The stabilization funding described above -- meant to make districts and schools whole -- will not be sufficient to accelerate learning to make up for the billions of hours of instructional time that students lost this spring. That is why Congress should allocate dedicated funds to help schools facilitate expanded learning time, via summer school (online or in-person based on the most recent public health guidance available), extended day or year, intensive tutoring, or other evidence-based approaches to support students in completing unfinished learning and accelerating new learning.
This additional funding must be targeted to prioritize the equity gaps we know have been exacerbated by COVID-19 and to prioritize students, including students from low-income backgrounds, students with disabilities, English learners, and students experiencing homelessness or foster care, who have been most directly impacted by lost in-person instructional time. Additionally, educators will need sufficient time to prepare for the next school year and the substantially different work environment that they will be faced with, including altered or expanded school schedules, additional remote instruction, and curricular changes. This professional learning and planning time comes at a cost; Congress must allocate funding to cover it.
Address Students' and Educators' Social, Emotional, Mental, Nutritional, and Physical Needs
All students are experiencing stress, anxiety, and learning obstacles due to school closures and other COVID-19-related stressors. Many families are feeling the strain of ensuring students receive the care, attention, and educational resources they need to thrive. Parents and guardians are scrambling to maintain their own jobs, meet their families' basic needs, identify child care, and help engage their students in meaningful online learning. These challenges are even greater for some students and families, including students from low-income backgrounds and students of color, who already face steep economic and health inequities previously mentioned. Therefore, in addition to academic learning, schools must prioritize and center the social, emotional, mental, and physical health needs of these historically underserved students upon return to school.
At a minimum, Congress must ensure students' basic needs are met, including the more than 20 million students who depend on schools for their meals every day. In a national survey by Hunger Free America, 37% of parents reported cutting the size of meals or skipping meals for their children because they did not have enough money for food between mid-March and mid-April, when the survey was released. Congress can directly address the food insecurity of students and their families through the Pandemic Electronic Benefits Transfer (P-EBT) program, which can ensure that students' nutritional needs are met throughout this summer and into the next school year. The program must also be expanded to cover children under 5 who are not currently included in this program due to the structure of the free-and-reduced-price lunch program.
Beyond basic needs, we know that over 75% of students receiving mental health care receive that care at school. Schools must also provide a positive and welcoming school climate, as well as quality dropout prevention and re-engagement programs -- especially for the most vulnerable students. Therefore, it is critical that Congress allocate additional federal funding to support school counselors, mental health workers, psychologists, and social workers in the highest-need districts, and allocate resources to train teachers to understand and address the negative impacts of COVID-19 on students, especially those of color and from low-income backgrounds.
It is also critical to remember that we must ensure the safety and well-being of administrators, educators, and support personnel. Educators are experiencing greater stress and anxiety during COVID-19. When educators were asked in a recent survey conducted by the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence about the most frequent emotion they felt each day of remote learning, their top five responses were: ""anxious, fearful, worried, overwhelmed and sad,"" with anxiety being the most mentioned emotion. These emotions can often lead to teacher burnout. Therefore, we must support our educators by providing them with emotional support and mental health resources.
Congress Must Protect Students' Civil Rights
Finally, it is important to note that during this hectic and uncertain time, Congress must not abdicate its important role in protecting students' civil rights. Therefore, Congress must not provide blanket waivers of critical requirements under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) or the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) that protect all students' civil rights. ESSA and IDEA were designed to ensure all students have equitable access to a high-quality education. That goal has not changed even with the current crises this country faces. The existing waiver authority within ESSA provides sufficient authority for the U.S. Department of Education to meet states' needs. As ED has already acknowledged, the impact of COVID-19 will affect each state differently; therefore, case-by-case consideration of each state's needs remains the most appropriate path moving forward. Permitting blanket waivers to either law is dangerous and unnecessary.
The equity concerns exacerbated by COVID-19 must remain Congressional priorities beyond the pandemic. That means maintaining resources for expanding broadband access; extended, tailored learning time to accelerate learning; and keeping resources for students' and educators' nutritional, social, emotional, and mental health needs in place. This funding must be targeted towards the students that need it most. Additionally, the federal government must do more to promote diverse schools and classrooms, require data reported by schools, districts, and states to be disaggregated by race, and enforce students' civil rights during this uncertain time.
This is also the time to address the other structural inequities within our systems that have persisted for generations - long before COVID arrived. That means ensuring all students, but particularly students of color, have access to the critical resources they need to graduate ready for college and careers.
Congress must also support states and districts to advance equity in these areas:
Ensure Equitable Funding
As described above, districts serving large populations of students of color and students from low-income families receive far less funding than those serving White and more affluent students. Despite widespread attention to inequitable funding formulas -- and courts that have declared them unlawful-- too many states continue this unfair practice. Across the country, school districts with the most Black, Latino, and Native students receive roughly $1,800, or 13%, less per student in state and local funding than those serving mostly White students, and states and districts spend approximately $1,000 less per pupil on students educated in our nation's highest poverty districts than on those educated in the lowest poverty districts.
While money alone will not solve the deeply embedded systemic inequities our students face, it matters a great deal. Research shows that increased school spending leads to increases in graduation rates, higher wages, and a reduction in adult poverty, especially for students from low-income backgrounds. To ensure equitable funding systems, Congress must support states to: (1) provide funding according to student need; (2) provide more funding to districts with low property wealth; (3) ensure that dollars are used well to improve student learning experiences and outcomes; and (4) be transparent about the funding system's design and monitor funding to districts. In addition, since ESSA requires that all states and districts report school-level per pupil expenditure data on state and local report cards, Congress has an especially important role to support states in sharing clear and transparent data on the amount of funding that schools actually receive. For many states, 2020 is the first year that they will be sharing this critical data with the public; Congress must ensure that the U.S. Department of Education is providing support to states to meet this requirement and enforcing the law when states do not provide this information in a timely manner.
Access to Strong and Diverse Educators
Research shows that teachers are the single greatest in-school factor for student success. Students with the strongest teachers receive what amounts to months' worth of additional learning each year. We also know that all students benefit from having at least one teacher of color, and students of color are more likely to attend school regularly, perform higher on end-of-year assessments, be referred to a gifted program, graduate high school, and consider college when they have had a teacher of the same race or ethnicity. Unfortunately, thousands of Black and Latino students attend a school where they have no same-race teachers. Even larger percentages of White students attend a school without a Black teacher and/or Latino teacher.
To ensure all students have access to strong and diverse educators, Congress must support states to: (1) set - then meet - clear goals at the state and district levels to increase access to strong and diverse educators; (2) target resources to the districts and schools that struggle the most to provide students from low-income backgrounds and students of color with access to strong teachers; (3) target resources to diversify the teaching workforce; (4) set high standards for how teachers are prepared and licensed to improve teaching quality for students in high-need schools and in historically underserved groups; and (5) make educator quality and diversity data more visible and actionable.
In addition, Congress must increase funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs) and other Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs). These institutions prepare nearly 40% of Black teachers with bachelor's degrees in the United States. Congress should also fund the Augustus Hawkins Centers of Excellence Grant program for the first time since its creation in the bipartisan Higher Education Act of 2008. This program would provide critical funding to MSIs to provide increased and enhanced clinical experience and increased financial aid to prospective teachers of color, who, as detailed above, face higher burdens in college access and affordability than their White peers.
Access to and Success in Advanced Coursework
Research shows that when students are given access to advanced coursework opportunities, they work harder and engage more in school, and in turn have fewer absences and suspensions and higher graduation rates. And when these opportunities are provided to students of color, and their teachers receive training and supports, these students thrive alongside their peers. But, as shared earlier, too many Black, Latino, and low-income students, do not receive these opportunities.
To ensure all students have access to and success in advanced coursework, Congress must support states to: (1) use data to identify the barriers that prevent students of color and students from low-income families from enrolling in advanced courses and take action; (2) set clear and measurable goals for advancing access to and success in advanced coursework; (3) invest to expand advanced coursework opportunities -- both courses and seats; (4) require and support districts to expand eligibility for advanced courses; and (5) support Black, Latino, and low-income students' success in advanced courses. Congress can act now to close opportunity gaps in access to advanced coursework by creating and funding grants to states and districts that can be used to implement open enrollment, establish universal enrollment or universal screening for advanced courses and programs, support districts in launching additional courses and innovative models that allow all students to benefit, purchase materials; cover the costs of advanced coursework exams for students from low-income backgrounds; and prepare and support educators to teach these courses.
Equitable State Accountability, School Improvement, and Reporting Systems
Not too long ago, students from low-income backgrounds, students of color, English learners, and students with disabilities -- who had long gone underserved in our schools -- were invisible, hidden behind averages. In 2015, ESSA, building on earlier federal legislation, challenged states to refine their accountability systems to provide the right combination of pressure and support for school improvement. The law leaves many key decisions up to states -- decisions about what to measure, how to communicate how schools are doing on those measures, how to identify schools that need to take action to improve for any group of students, what to do to support school improvement efforts, and what to do if schools don't improve.
To ensure these systems are focused on supporting equity and achievement for all students, Congress must support states to: (1) only include indicators in state accountability systems that keep student learning front and center; (2) ensure that school ratings reflect how schools are doing for all groups of students; (3) establish criteria that honestly identify which schools need to take steps to improve overall or for one or more student groups; (4) provide meaningful support to schools that need to improve; and (5) report information that is understandable, easily accessible, and widely available. In particular, Congress must require states to administer statewide assessments during the 2020-21 school year. These assessments aligned to grade-level expectations are critical not only to helping families and educators understand how well students are learning, but also to supporting policymakers and leaders in identifying the places that are seeing promising results for all students so we can learn from those places.
Access to Equitable Learning Environments
Recognizing that school is where students spend the bulk of the time learning about themselves, their emotions and behaviors, and how to interact with others, over 90% of schools and districts report that they are working to support the social and emotional learning of students. Studies also show that social and emotional well-being is inextricably linked to the context in which students develop and the relationships they build over time. Too often, approaches to supporting social and emotional learning in schools ignore context, focusing solely on building specific skills (e.g., lessons on behavior). Ignoring context carries significant risks, especially for those students who are already underserved by our education system: students from low-income families, students of color, LGBT youth, students with disabilities, and English learners. Failing to acknowledge the influence of the learning environment, or failing to address the processes and structures in schools that disadvantage some students, may do more harm than good. Congress must support states and districts to provide all students with equitable learning environments that foster belonging, challenge students, and provide the supports students need to thrive. This means, for example, funding and providing meaningful professional development and coaching on topics such as reducing bias and anti-racist mindsets; improving working environments and conditions to retain educators of color; and ensuring equitable access to and supports for success in rigorous and culturally sustaining coursework.
In addition, we must recognize that for Black children, attending school is an act of racial justice. In early 2019, when the current administration rescinded school discipline guidance that was put in place explicitly to ensure that Black children were not pushed out of school buildings, it sent a loud and clear message that it is okay for educators and school leaders to exclude these students from opportunities to learn. Congress must renounce that message and instead proactively support states and districts in identifying and addressing disparate school discipline policies and practices.
Congress Needs to Enact Equitable Reforms to Higher Education
Allocate Funds to Allow for Safe Reopening, Relief for Students, and Enable Learning to Continue
In response to COVID-19, Congress took important steps in the CARES Act that should be maintained into next year. Congress should look to build on its initial higher education stabilization in CARES by allocating an additional $50 billion in aid to help keep students from suffering economic hardship and assist nonprofit colleges and universities to remain financially stable while preparing for a safe reopening. Those funds should also be allowed to assist students who are incarcerated, undocumented, or otherwise barred from federal financial aid under other circumstances.
Congress should also take direct action to enable postsecondary learning to continue. The pandemic necessitates a doubling of the Pell Grant in light of the increasing financial uncertainty facing students who may be forced to halt their studies due to a lack of funding. Additionally, in light of the FAFSA renewal rate dropping below prior years, Congress should work with the Department of Education, as seen recently in a bipartisan letter from four U.S. Senators, to figure out how best to streamline the filing process to remove financial obstacles for students and their families, especially those directly impacted by the pandemic. To enable home learning, Congress should include the Supporting Connectivity for Higher Education Students in Need Act in its next response package, which would direct $1 billion to institutions that are primarily serving students of color and students from low-income backgrounds to ensure that students at those institutions can get the home Internet access they need to continue their postsecondary education. Finally, Congress should provide dedicated funds to support student success and completion. This funding stream should support students' academic and social needs that have been impacted by the crisis, such as mental health services and supplemental academic support. This could take the form of bridge programs, co-requisite instruction, and/or supplemental academic support for Pell-eligible students to make up for lost learning and increase the number of available advisers and counselors.
The student loan relief provisions in CARES gave relief to millions of borrowers facing tremendous economic pressure in the face of the recession, and those should be extended into next year. Congress should build on that relief by extending equitable, targeted debt forgiveness to millions of borrowers who were already struggling and are facing a near insurmountable repayment burden in the wake of the recession.
Protect, Increase, and Expand Pell Grants
The Pell Grant program is the cornerstone of federal financial aid. Created in 1972 as the Basic Educational Opportunity Grant, the program benefits over 7 million students annually and continues to serve as the primary federal effort to open the door to college for students from low-income backgrounds. Over one-third of White students, two-thirds of Black students, and half of Latino students rely on Pell Grants every year. Pell Grant dollars are well-targeted to those in need: 83% of Pell recipients come from families with annual incomes at or below $40,000, including 44% with annual family incomes at or below $15,000.
The Pell Grant program's impact is shrinking as the maximum award has failed to keep pace with the rapidly rising cost of college. The purchasing power of the Pell Grant has dropped dramatically since the program's inception. In 1980, the maximum Pell Grant award covered 77% of the cost of attendance at a public university. Today, it covers just over 28%, the lowest portion in over 40 years. If the maximum award continues to stagnate, the grant will cover just one-fifth of college costs in 10 years.
Doubling the Pell Grant is a rational response to the enrollment downturn due to the pandemic and the steady erosion of the purchasing power of the award. After prioritizing that step, Congress should also make the following structural reforms: re-index it to inflation, as it was before 2017, move the program to the mandatory side of the budget to avoid potential discretionary cuts to a program that functions like a mandatory program, and expand it and other federal financial aid to students who are incarcerated and students who are undocumented to maximize education opportunity and help close equity gaps.
Increasing Equity Through Better Data and Funding Improvement Plans
Equity-focused accountability has the potential to refocus our higher education system on its most important purpose: successful outcomes for all groups of students. Congress must build upon current policy to create an accountability system that pushes institutions to serve students well, especially low-income students and students of color.
The first step in creating an equity-focused accountability system is maintaining and strengthening the protections we have in place currently. There is bipartisan support for closing the 90/10 loophole that sets up veterans as targets for predatory for-profits, and Congress should take that action, as well as moving the rule back to 85/15, per its original conception. Additionally, the recent gainful employment regulatory changes by the Department of Education removed the ability to hold accountable continuously poor-performing career education programs, and the recent borrower defense regulatory rewrite all but eliminated the right of defrauded or misled borrowers to get their federal loans discharged. Both of these changes should be reversed, and prior versions of the gainful employment rule and borrower defense rule restored.
In order to construct effective accountability and oversight systems, Congress must act to improve higher education data systems so they may provide reliable, consistent, and useable information. The bipartisan, bicameral College Transparency Act would overturn the ban on the creation of a student-level data system that would be immensely important in helping policymakers design systems that promote equity. Creating a student-level data system would make data on critical measures of student success like enrollment, persistence, retention, transfer, and completion, as well as post-enrollment outcomes such as earnings and employment, much easier to obtain and disaggregate by race, income, gender, ancestry, and other key criteria. The bill also contains privacy protections for sensitive student information essential to protecting the civil rights of all students.
In addition to maintaining and strengthening the accountability provisions currently in place, Congress must create pressure and provide support for the entire higher education system to improve, especially for the students from low-income backgrounds and students of color who are most likely to be underserved by today's system. Developing metrics that would establish minimum standards for institutions enrolling low-income students and students of color, and establish minimum standards for institutions regarding the performance, experiences, and outcomes for those low-income students and students of color are a prerequisite to holding institutions accountable for closing equity gaps in higher education.
However, any system that sets standards and walks away is one that is guaranteed to do damage to low-income students and students of color at institutions that need additional resources to respond to those standards. Investments in historically under-resourced institutions to support the implementation of evidence-based strategies that improve completion for students from low-income backgrounds and students of color are essential to making lasting, positive change for historically underserved students. In addition to investing more in Title III and Title V institutions, Congress should create a fund to support the development and scaling of interventions that improve completion.
Finally, take a rehabilitative approach to institutional improvement, not a punitive one. New standards that consider the reality that closing institutions can do tremendous damage to the students that are attending them should be implemented. This means consequences should be targeted at the programmatic level where possible, institutions should have time to adjust to new standards, continual growth and progress should allow for reduced consequences, and institutions that fail should be given support and the chance to submit improvement plans. However, when institutions are not meeting benchmarks, students, families, states and accreditors should be notified, and restrictions on enrollment and the elimination of Title IV eligibility must be on the table as eventual realities.
Investment in Student Success
Congress should invest in evidence-based policies to improve student success and close racial equity gaps. There is a growing body of evidence that wraparound support models like the City University New York's Accelerated Study in Associate Program (ASAP) are transformational for students. In New York City, ASAP nearly doubled three-year graduation rates for participants, up to 40% from 22%. While it required some upfront investment, due to the significant increase in graduation rates, CUNY ASAP drove down the cost per degree by 11%. These findings were replicated by three pilot programs in Ohio, which also nearly doubled three-year graduation rates and increased transfer rates to four-year colleges, and showed positive effects on enrollment, full-time enrollment, and credits earned. It also lowered the cost per degree. In order to scale these proven models, Congress should approve the Community College Student Success Act, which would provide grants to community colleges to scale ASAP-type programs. In addition to expanding ASAP, there are also promising practices around emergency student aid and microgrants that deserve further study, and Congress should support the development of these practices as well. Finally, students who are hungry cannot learn. Congress should make it easier for college students to enroll in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by eliminating the 20-hour work requirement that acts as a barrier for thousands of students.
Congress Must Protect Students' Civil Rights
The federal government has a vital historical role as the protector of civil rights and safety on college campuses. Colleges are venues for the exchange of ideas and the development and growth of students, not places where discrimination, hate crimes, or sexual assault are condoned. We support federal policies that encourage institutions to support a healthy campus racial climate, based on how accepted students feel on campus, how often they are able to engage across lines of difference, and how well the university supports diversity through events, clubs, and policies. Regular surveys of students and faculty on campus climate are essential practices to determine how to select and implement policies to ensure campus safety and equitable treatment. Federal, state, and institutional systems should include indicators that track and report incidents of bias or violence on campus. Federal requirements administered by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Offices of Civil Rights can also provide some of this data to help inform Congress as they look to address these issues.
Conclusion
In closing, we cannot underestimate the impact that this crisis will have -- and has already had -- on all of our students, but particularly our children of color and children from low-income backgrounds. They and their families are already bearing the brunt of the crisis.
More than 118,000 people in the United States have died of the coronavirus, and more than 33 million Americans have filed for unemployment during the pandemic. Both in terms of deaths and lost jobs, people of color are disproportionately affected.
When students do eventually return to brick-and-mortar buildings, there will be students at the K-12 and postsecondary levels sitting next to each other with very different levels of learning. Young students whose parents had the resources and flexibility to help them learn via high speed internet while school was closed, and those whose parents had to work, possibly on the front lines, to make ends meet and who had less reliable internet access during the crisis have had substantially different remote learning experiences. We must ensure that the latter receive the support necessary to get the quality education they deserve. College students who went home to comfortable surroundings and families that didn't require them to provide financial and/or caregiving support have structural advantages that students who must also juggle financial or caregiving responsibilities at home while trying to focus on their studies or are plagued by worries about how to pay for college and stay in school amid the pandemic do not. If there is a post-pandemic return to the old ""normal"" -- obscuring the inequities that we know exist -- we will have learned nothing. The old normal is no longer an acceptable option -- we must supply the resources and supports to ensure that equity gaps are closed for good.
If we fail to educate and protect students of color and students from low-income backgrounds, we have failed as a nation. We can choose to continue to shut out communities of color and low-income communities or we can make changes to allow for a more inclusive America -- one that protects the most underserved and allows everyone to reach their full potential.
The challenges facing us right now are significant, but they are not insurmountable. The Education Trust stands ready to assist and support you in the work ahead.
Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today. I look forward to taking your questions.

75,/content/Bias_Incident_Lexis_1.DOCX,Targeted News Service,2020-06-23,10435 words,,Targeted News Service,,House Education & Labor Committee Issues Testimony From The Education Trust,False,"The House Education and Labor Committee issued the following testimony by John B. King Jr., president and CEO of The Education Trust, for a remote hearing entitled ""Inequities Exposed: How COVID-19 Widened Racial Inequities in Education, Health, and the Workforce"" on June 22:
This hearing takes place in the shadow of massive global protests against police violence seeking to ensure that ""Black Lives Matter"" is more than just a hashtag. The murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and Rayshard Brooks remind us yet again that systemic racism, anti-Blackness, and the legacy of slavery still infect our institutions, public discourse, and daily interactions. Now is the time to transform the lofty rhetoric of statements about solidarity into concrete action toward achieving justice.
Our education system is fraught with racial inequities that existed before COVID-19. Far too few Black and Latino children have access to affordable, high-quality preschool. Black children, especially Black boys, are disproportionately suspended and expelled from early learning programs. The pandemic has pushed our early childhood education sector toward collapse, which could have dire consequences for families of color and an early childhood workforce disproportionately made up of women of color.
Over 65 years after Brown v. Board of Education, district lines and school assignment policies still segregate K-12 students by race and class. Districts with the most Black, Latino, and Native American students spend almost $2,000 less per student per year than districts with mostly White students. Students of color are less likely to be assigned to the strongest teachers, less likely to have access to school counselors, less likely to be enrolled in advanced coursework, and more likely to be subjected to exclusionary discipline. These opportunity gaps in turn generate gaps in learning, high school graduation, and college matriculation.
The higher education sector still doesn't reflect America's diversity: Not one state's public colleges enroll or graduate a representative share of Black and Latino students relative to the state population. Meanwhile, the burden of student debt falls disproportionately on Black students, who are more likely than their White peers to have to borrow and also more likely to default.
COVID-19 has exacerbated these educational disparities. During the necessary school closures, Black, Latino, and Native American students disproportionately had less access to devices and home internet service; teachers with less support to execute online learning; parents unable to telework and assist with schoolwork; and more socioemotional stressors. As noted in my recent Senate HELP Committee testimony: ""Our nation's students of color and their families find themselves enduring a pandemic that disproportionately impacts their health and safety, mired in an economic crisis that disproportionately affects their financial well-being, and living in a country that too often still struggles to recognize their humanity."" In response, we urge Congress to take the following actions:
First: Congress must act boldly to support and strengthen P-12 education.
To address devastating budget shortfalls, over 70 stakeholders have called on Congress to allocate at least $500 billion for state and local governments, including at least $175 billion for K-12 education, and $50 billion for higher education. This federal stabilization funding must include a strong maintenance of effort provision, and add a maintenance of equity provision so states and districts can ensure that the most vulnerable students retain critical supports. Congress must allocate dedicated funding for broadband expansion to enable distance learning for millions of low-income students, for extended learning time to tackle the significant learning loss resulting from the pandemic, and for resources to address students' and educators' nutritional, social, emotional, and mental health needs. Congress should refrain from permitting blanket waivers to key civil rights laws like ESSA and IDEA, and protect the historic interpretation of the Title I equitable services provision in administering the CARES Act and future funds. Additionally, the federal government must promote diverse schools, require data to be disaggregated by race, and uphold students' civil rights.
Second: Congress must enact equitable reforms to higher education.
Congress should extend the student loan relief provisions included in the CARES Act into next year and offer equitable, targeted debt forgiveness in recognition that the recession will make repaying student debt impossible for millions of borrowers. To counter widespread losses of financial assistance and employment, which may keep millions of students from enrolling or staying enrolled, Congress should double the Pell Grant and simplify the FAFSA process.
Implementing those policies would increase enrollment and limit debt for students of color, but there is more Congress can do, including: expanding Pell access to incarcerated students and undocumented students, increasing investments in HBCUs and MSIs, supporting diversity in educator preparation programs, investing in evidence-based strategies to improve outcomes for low-income students and students of color, reigning in predatory for-profit institutions, and collecting better data to monitor progress. Finally, the federal government should never waver in its commitment to protect the civil rights and safety of all students.
The racial inequities we face in education are significant, but not insurmountable. The Education Trust stands ready to assist you in the work ahead.
Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today. I look forward to taking your questions.
Chairman Scott, Ranking Member Foxx, and members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify on the structural racial inequities in our nation's educational systems that are being exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and how best to address them going forward.
As I had the opportunity to share with the Senate HELP Committee earlier this month, this hearing takes place in the shadow of massive demonstrations across the globe by millions protesting the continued toll of systemic racism in America. The murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and Rayshard Brooks remind us that the legacies of slavery and Jim Crow, racial discrimination, and anti-Blackness still infect many of our institutions, our public discourse, and our daily interactions. Students of color, their families, and millions of others are risking their own lives amid an ongoing public health crisis to ensure that ""Black Lives Matter"" is more than just a hashtag. Now is the time to transform the lofty rhetoric of solidarity into concrete action toward achieving educational justice.
Our nation's education system is fraught with racial inequities, some of which manifest before students of color even enter kindergarten. Young children of color face particularly challenging barriers to high-quality early care and education, while disproportionately living in poverty. Infant care can cost up to 116% of a low-income family's total income, yet far too few families receive financial assistance to access it: for instance, Early Head Start provides access to only 7% of eligible infants and toddlers. Child care subsidies through the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) serve a very small portion of potentially federally eligible children of color: only 15% of Black children and 6% of Latino children. Accessing any type of child care is challenging for many families of color: 57% of Latino families and 60% of American Indian and Alaskan Native families live in child care deserts. And when states do fund high-quality preschool programs, access is often lower for Black and Latino children, who are underrepresented in several such programs. Young children of color who do have access to early childhood education are pushed out of the classroom at alarming rates: Black children, and especially Black boys, are disproportionately suspended and expelled from early learning settings. The COVID-19 crisis has compounded these inequities, and has pushed early care and learning toward collapse, which has potentially deleterious consequences for families of color with young children and an early childhood workforce disproportionately made up of women of color.
As students enter our K-12 systems, the inequities persist. School districts with the most Black, Latino, and Native American students receive roughly $1,800, or 13%, less per student in state and local funding than those serving mostly White students. Students of color and students from low-income backgrounds are less likely to have access to strong, consistent teaching than their White and higher-income peers. Furthermore, only 20 percent of teachers are teachers of color compared to half of all students in the United States being students of color. Beyond ensuring that the teacher workforce is representative of the country, there are proven benefits of having a diverse teacher workforce. Students of color who have had teachers of the same race do better academically and are more likely to graduate from high school and attend a four-year college. Research suggests that Black teachers are also more likely than White teachers to have high expectations for Black students, and less likely to use exclusionary discipline on them. Furthermore, schools staffed by leaders and teachers of color expose all students to positive role models of different races, and counteract negative stereotypes.
In 38 states, the schools that serve more students of color and students from low-income backgrounds have fewer counselors per student than schools that serve fewer of these students, which puts underrepresented students at a disadvantage when social, emotional, and academic supports are needed beyond the classroom. Additionally, despite studies showing that Black students do not misbehave more than other students, Black students are disproportionately suspended, expelled and arrested at school. According to the Civil Rights Data Collection, Black students comprise only 15% of school enrollment, but account for 40% of students who receive an out-of-school suspension, 35% of those expelled, and 36% of students who were arrested at school. Racial disparities exist in relation to coursework, as well. Based on The Education Trust's analysis of data from the Civil Rights Data Collection and the Common Core of Data, Black and Latino students are locked out of advanced coursework at every critical stage of their education - they are denied these opportunities in elementary school, middle school and high school. We know students of color can be and are successful in eighth grade Algebra I courses, yet students who attend schools with the lowest percentages of students of color are about 1.5 times as likely to be enrolled in eighth grade algebra as students attending schools with the highest percentages of students of color.
Given these inequities in opportunity and access, it is not surprising that we see different outcomes when we look at measures of student learning and graduation rates. On the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), Black and Latino students are more likely to score at the basic and below basic levels than their White peers. For example, in 2019, 18% of students from low-income backgrounds, 14% of Black students, and 20% of Latino students scored at or above proficient on the eighth grade math assessment, compared to 48% and 44% of their non-low-income and White peers, respectively. We also see smaller percentages of students who are Black, Latino, Indigenous, or from low-income backgrounds, and students with disabilities graduating from high school compared to their peers. While the overall graduation rate for the class of 2017-18 was 85.3%, it was lower for Black students (79%), Native American students (73.5%), students from low-income backgrounds (79.5%), and students with disabilities (67.1%).
As students of color transition into postsecondary education, they move into a public college system that doesn't reflect America's diversity: Not one state's public colleges enroll or graduate a representative share of Black and Latino students relative to state population.
In fact, since 2000, the percentage of Black students has decreased at nearly 60% of the 101 most selective public colleges and universities in the United States. Fewer than 1 in 10 of these colleges (9%) enrolls a percentage of Black students on campus that is proportional to the Black population of the state in which they reside. Since 2000, the growth of Latino enrollment at 65% of these institutions failed to keep pace with the growth in the state's Latino population. And only 1 in 7 of these colleges (14%) has a percentage of Latino students that is representative of their state's Latino population.
Once enrolled, the chance of completing college also differs for White and Black students, even within the same income group. At four-year institutions, White students are at least 11 percentage points more likely to complete a college degree than their Black counterparts, regardless of income group. The completion gaps are wide among low, lower middle, and upper middle income groups, but this discrepancy was the largest in the lower middle income group. White students were 17 percentage points more likely to graduate than their Black counterparts (67% vs. 50%), while among students from families with the highest incomes, the completion gap was considerable but somewhat smaller (11 percentage points).
And the racial disparities don't end there. Black students are vastly underrepresented in higher education, yet those that do attend college often bear a disproportionate student debt burden. Black students are more likely to borrow and default on their loans than their White peers. For federal loans, default occurs after a borrower is 270 days late and it is the most disastrous financial outcome of student debt. Defaulting not only ruins a person's credit, but makes future borrowing more expensive and can make it harder to get a job, rent an apartment, or buy a house or a car. Half of Black borrowers who entered college in the 2003-04 academic year defaulted on their student loans within 12 years, a staggeringly high number when compared to the nationwide default rate of 10%. Protective factors like degree completion or high family income, which would normally shield borrowers from adverse debt outcomes, don't necessarily protect Black borrowers. A Black bachelor's degree recipient is more likely to default than a White college dropout, and Black students from high-income families default at rates that are seven times higher than their White peers. Higher default rates among Black borrowers are not the result of over-borrowing or poor decisions, but are caused by structural racism that harms Black people financially and perpetuates the racial wealth gap.
These inequities are compounded by racial disparities in the labor market, where the Black unemployment rate is consistently double that of their White counterparts. Regardless of education level, the same racial disparities in employment persist: In May 2020, White bachelor's degree holders had lower unemployment rates than Black, Hispanic or Latino, and Asian American bachelor's degree holders. This structural disadvantage is a key contributor to the overall financial insecurity and inability to build intergenerational wealth among communities of color: Today's median Black family has a net wealth of $3,600, while the median Latino family has a net wealth of $6,600, compared to $147,000 for the median White family. The racial wealth gap is a product of slavery, Jim Crow, and racist federal housing policy. Combined with ongoing discrimination in employment and lending, these systemic barriers have effectively prevented many Black families from building wealth through homeownership, leaving them with a fraction of the wealth of White people.
The grim reality is that COVID-19 has made the inequities present in our education system, like those detailed above, even worse.
From its onset, the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored that not all adults have the privilege of working from home in accordance with states' social distancing or stay-at-home orders, and that those who are deemed ""essential"" and are required to place themselves at risk are disproportionately individuals of color or those from working-class, low-income backgrounds. Only about 1 in 5 Black workers and 1 in 6 Latino workers are able to work from home, compared with about 1 in 3 White workers. Research shows that predominantly Black counties account for over half of coronavirus cases in the United States, and nearly 60% of total deaths. It also shows that social determinants -- including employment, access to health insurance and medical care, and poor air and water quality -- are more predictive of infection and death from COVID-19 than are underlying health conditions. In Chicago, while Black residents are about 30% of the city's population, they account for nearly 70% of COVID-19 deaths. Stunningly, as of June 10, 1 in every 1,625 Black Americans has died from COVID-19, compared to 1 in 3,800 White Americans. Even more recent Centers for Disease Control data shows that a disproportionate number of Latinos are suffering from COVID-19 relative to their share of the U.S. population. In nearby Anne Arundel County, Maryland, Latino residents account for 38% of all cases, despite only making up 8% of that county's population.
The economic toll on communities of color has been substantial. A new Associated Press poll finds that over 60% of Hispanic Americans say they have experienced some form of household income loss as a result of the pandemic, including job losses, unpaid leave, cuts in pay, and fewer scheduled hours compared with 46% of Americans overall. While 37% of Hispanic Americans and 27% of Black Americans say they've been unable to pay at least one type of bill as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, only 17% of White Americans say the same. A recent poll indicated that Latino and Black workers were more likely to be laid off due to the pandemic than their White peers, and that people of color who remain employed are more worried about losing their jobs.
The inequities impacting how Americans of different races, ethnicities, and incomes are experiencing the pandemic translate to educational inequities as well. Across the nation, schools are struggling to move to distance learning, as are teachers and administrators who may not have familiarity with learning management technology tools. Parents and educators alike are searching for promising practices and online learning resources, and many schools and districts lack large-scale experience with education technology. This spring, we also saw many high school students take at-home versions of Advanced Placement tests, which are often a factor in college admissions, despite not every student having the same access to an AP course or test. Additionally, not every student has a compatible device or access to high-speed internet to make online learning viable. As a result, a recent survey of teachers noted that student learning since schools closed has dropped to three hours a day, from six previously, and that lower-income students were down to two hours a day. Earlier in the pandemic, Los Angeles reported that about a third of its high school students were not logging in for classes. In states where schools remain closed for months or even longer, learning loss among students, particularly those who are already vulnerable, may carry far into the future, unless directly addressed through expanded learning opportunities.
Confronted with the uncertainty about the nature of COVID-19 and how long it may prevent the full resumption of in-person learning, parents and families are understandably concerned not only about their children's health and well-being, but also about their children's education at this unprecedented time. The Education Trust just conducted polls of parents in New York, Washington, Texas, and California. These polls show that nearly 90% of parents are worried that their children will fall behind academically because of school closings. Equity concerns about distance education seem particularly valid when we know that before the pandemic, 79% of White households had broadband access, while only 66% of Black families and 61% of Hispanic families had broadband service at home.
The Education Trust is grateful that many educators across the country have made one important shift during this crisis -- showing their students even more clearly that they care by asking about students' well-being and connecting families with resources to provide some levity through fun virtual interactions with their students. This relationship-building between teachers and students was already happening in many places, but it was not happening nearly enough in places that serve a majority of students of color and students from low-income backgrounds. That connection is essential. In addition, Ed Trust's parent poll in New York revealed that 95% of parents want to have regular contact with or access to their child's teacher, but only 52% said their child's school has made that available. Our California poll revealed that Black parents were less likely than parents of all other racial groups to have been contacted by their child's teacher. We need to make sure this is something that is cherished in places where students face the most obstacles.
The pandemic also has had detrimental effects on college students forced to leave their campuses and return home to learn remotely, and especially on those who were working while enrolled and have lost income that's essential to continuing their education. The impact of the pandemic can also be seen in the disaggregated data showing which groups of students are worried about being able to graduate on time, and considering delaying or changing their education plans. Roughly three-quarters of undergraduate students have said they were worried about being able to stay on track and graduate, and those shares were higher among Black and Latino students. Another survey showed that 32% of Latino students, 24% of Black students, and 21% of Asian American students have canceled or delayed their education plans in light of the pandemic. College students are also impacted by the digital divide, as they return to homes that may not have reliable broadband access. Black and Latino students are also overrepresented within the population of students that were denied emergency financial aid by Secretary Betsy DeVos' interpretation of the CARES Act: undocumented students, incarcerated students, and students who have defaulted on their loans. All of these pressures take a toll on students' mental health: 80% said that the pandemic had negatively affected their mental health.
As noted in our Senate testimony earlier this month, our nation's students of color and their families find themselves enduring a pandemic that disproportionately impacts their health and safety, mired in an economic crisis that disproportionately affects their financial well-being, and living in a country that too often still struggles to recognize their humanity.
In response to these racial inequities, which have only grown in the wake of this pandemic, we urge Congress to take the following actions:
How Congress Can Act Boldly to Support and Strengthen P-12 Education in the Midst of COVID-19
Allocate Funds to Allow for Safe Reopening, Relief for Students, and Enable Learning to Continue
The first step toward making the system more equitable is to prevent the pandemic from making that task even harder. States and localities -- which provide the vast majority of K-12 education funding -- are bracing for major budget cuts as revenues continue to plummet. After the Great Recession of 2008, over 300,000 educators lost their jobs, and inflation adjusted state funding per pupil was still lower in 2017 than 2008. This time the cuts may be even larger. If we ignore the lessons of the last economic slowdown, students of color and students from low-income backgrounds will be hardest hit by these cuts. For example, while funding cuts to education were widespread following the Great Recession, an analysis of layoffs in Los Angeles found that Latino elementary students were 26% more likely than their White peers to have their teacher laid off; Black elementary students 72% more likely to have their teacher laid off.
The National Education Association projects that the United States could lose as many as 1.9 million education jobs if Congress doesn't extend financial relief to states and localities, and nearly half a million K-12 education jobs disappeared in April alone. The Learning Policy Institute estimates, based on projected state revenue losses for the end of this fiscal year and the next, that K-12 systems might need as much as $230 billion to stabilize their budgets. And those estimates are focused solely on making districts whole; they do not incorporate the additional costs that districts will face as a direct result of responding to COVID-19, including sanitizing schools, personal protective equipment, and providing devices and materials for distance/hybrid learning.
This is why over 70 education stakeholders have called on Congress to allocate at least $500 billion for state and local stabilization, and require that a proportional amount of these funds be directed toward K-12 spending. As K-12 education makes up, on average, 35% of state general funds, Congress should allocate at least $175 billion for K-12 education. An investment of this size is essential to, at minimum, prevent the K-12 education system in America from becoming more inequitable in the wake of the pandemic.
These targeted federal stabilization funds, as well as the additional provisions outlined below, are necessary to ensure that schools are able to reopen safely and that states and districts are able to provide all schools -- particularly underfunded, high-poverty schools that serve more students of color -- with the resources they need to implement the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) considerations and each local health authority's guidance for keeping students and staff safe (e.g., adequate testing and contact tracing, use of PPE, protections for at-risk staff and students, social distancing, etc.). The funds will also be essential to maintain the nation's education workforce and implement equitable policies to the benefit of all students.
Ensure States and Districts Do Not Walk Away From the Students Hit Hardest by This Crisis
While the federal government must provide financial assistance to address looming revenue shortfalls and budget cuts, states and school districts remain the primary actors in funding local education systems and deciding how equitably that funding is used. Federal stabilization money must be accompanied by strong requirements to ensure that states maintain their investments in education; to ensure that states and districts minimize cuts to their highest need districts and schools; and to prevent the U.S. Department of Education (ED) from steering funding away from low-income, public school students.
Specifically, the federal government must include maintenance of effort provisions that require state education spending levels to remain constant (i.e., at least at the same percentage of the state's total spending), even if the state's overall budget shrinks. Further, if spending cuts are necessary, the federal government must use a maintenance of equity provision to protect our highest-need schools by requiring both states and districts that receive additional federal funding to show that any necessary cuts are smaller per student in the highest-need districts and schools than the rest of the state or district.
Finally, we've already seen ED advise states and school districts to steer federal funding away from low-income, public school students into the hands of wealthier, Whiter private schools. Therefore, we urge Congress to prevent forthcoming regulations that would allow the Department of Education's recent misinterpretation of the Title I equitable services provision within the CARES Act to be used to direct over $1.35 billion in CARES Act financial assistance away from public Title I schools primarily serving Black and Latino students to private schools that primarily serve White students, regardless of whether those schools are serving students from low-income backgrounds. Several states have already rejected this approach.
Ensure That Distance Learning is Possible for Every Student
Before the pandemic, 79% of White households had broadband access, while only 66% of Black families and 61 % of Hispanic families had broadband service at home. More than one-third of all households with school-age children and incomes of less than $30,000 annually lack high-speed internet access. Additionally, Microsoft estimates that as many as 163 million people do not use the internet at broadband speeds, burdening students even further.
It is likely that distance learning will continue through the summer, into the beginning of next year, and intermittently if new cases of the virus emerge. The data we have from this spring is alarming. For example, data from California showed that 38% of low-income families and 29% of families of color are concerned about access to distance learning because they don't have reliable internet at home. Therefore, states and districts must have a plan in place to ensure that all students, including students from low-income backgrounds, have access to reliable, high-speed internet and devices and IT support to connect to virtual learning opportunities, and that educators have the support they need to effectively teach, assess, and connect with their students remotely. The lack of equitable access to broadband is not only a distance learning issue, but also an emergency preparedness issue in the event of further widespread closures.
Congress must allocate at least $4 billion through an Emergency Connectivity Fund via the Federal Communications Commission's federal E-Rate program to expand access to broadband services, Wi-Fi hotspots, and devices to ensure that all students have the ability to access online learning at home in the event of continued disruptions, and Congress should encourage districts to implement multilingual digital learning platforms to be fully inclusive. Congress should also encourage private companies to enable home broadband access for the students in the communities they serve at no cost during the pandemic.
Beyond the emergency response to ensure access during the pandemic, Congress should be looking at what it would take to ensure that the homework gap that affects at least 8 million K-12 students annually is closed for good. The same racial inequities in high-speed home Internet access exacerbated by the crisis will be present beyond it. America needs a national policy that recognizes that the Internet is an essential tool in continuing education outside of the classroom, both formally and informally, and that it is increasingly obvious that part of solving the racial inequities in education is solving the homework gap.
Address Learning Loss Through Expanded Learning Opportunities
Students will likely return to classrooms with significant learning loss, which schools and teachers must be prepared to assess and address. Schools serving larger populations of students from low-income backgrounds are far less likely to be able to provide online learning opportunities for all students and, therefore, must find a way to make up for lost instructional time. In fact, an analysis done by McKinsey indicated that the average lost learning time for Black students due to the pandemic could be as much as 10 months; for Hispanic students, as much nine months; and for low-income students, over a year.
The stabilization funding described above -- meant to make districts and schools whole -- will not be sufficient to accelerate learning to make up for the billions of hours of instructional time that students lost this spring. That is why Congress should allocate dedicated funds to help schools facilitate expanded learning time, via summer school (online or in-person based on the most recent public health guidance available), extended day or year, intensive tutoring, or other evidence-based approaches to support students in completing unfinished learning and accelerating new learning.
This additional funding must be targeted to prioritize the equity gaps we know have been exacerbated by COVID-19 and to prioritize students, including students from low-income backgrounds, students with disabilities, English learners, and students experiencing homelessness or foster care, who have been most directly impacted by lost in-person instructional time. Additionally, educators will need sufficient time to prepare for the next school year and the substantially different work environment that they will be faced with, including altered or expanded school schedules, additional remote instruction, and curricular changes. This professional learning and planning time comes at a cost; Congress must allocate funding to cover it.
Address Students' and Educators' Social, Emotional, Mental, Nutritional, and Physical Needs
All students are experiencing stress, anxiety, and learning obstacles due to school closures and other COVID-19-related stressors. Many families are feeling the strain of ensuring students receive the care, attention, and educational resources they need to thrive. Parents and guardians are scrambling to maintain their own jobs, meet their families' basic needs, identify child care, and help engage their students in meaningful online learning. These challenges are even greater for some students and families, including students from low-income backgrounds and students of color, who already face steep economic and health inequities previously mentioned. Therefore, in addition to academic learning, schools must prioritize and center the social, emotional, mental, and physical health needs of these historically underserved students upon return to school.
At a minimum, Congress must ensure students' basic needs are met, including the more than 20 million students who depend on schools for their meals every day. In a national survey by Hunger Free America, 37% of parents reported cutting the size of meals or skipping meals for their children because they did not have enough money for food between mid-March and mid-April, when the survey was released. Congress can directly address the food insecurity of students and their families through the Pandemic Electronic Benefits Transfer (P-EBT) program, which can ensure that students' nutritional needs are met throughout this summer and into the next school year. The program must also be expanded to cover children under 5 who are not currently included in this program due to the structure of the free-and-reduced-price lunch program.
Beyond basic needs, we know that over 75% of students receiving mental health care receive that care at school. Schools must also provide a positive and welcoming school climate, as well as quality dropout prevention and re-engagement programs -- especially for the most vulnerable students. Therefore, it is critical that Congress allocate additional federal funding to support school counselors, mental health workers, psychologists, and social workers in the highest-need districts, and allocate resources to train teachers to understand and address the negative impacts of COVID-19 on students, especially those of color and from low-income backgrounds.
It is also critical to remember that we must ensure the safety and well-being of administrators, educators, and support personnel. Educators are experiencing greater stress and anxiety during COVID-19. When educators were asked in a recent survey conducted by the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence about the most frequent emotion they felt each day of remote learning, their top five responses were: ""anxious, fearful, worried, overwhelmed and sad,"" with anxiety being the most mentioned emotion. These emotions can often lead to teacher burnout. Therefore, we must support our educators by providing them with emotional support and mental health resources.
Congress Must Protect Students' Civil Rights
Finally, it is important to note that during this hectic and uncertain time, Congress must not abdicate its important role in protecting students' civil rights. Therefore, Congress must not provide blanket waivers of critical requirements under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) or the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) that protect all students' civil rights. ESSA and IDEA were designed to ensure all students have equitable access to a high-quality education. That goal has not changed even with the current crises this country faces. The existing waiver authority within ESSA provides sufficient authority for the U.S. Department of Education to meet states' needs. As ED has already acknowledged, the impact of COVID-19 will affect each state differently; therefore, case-by-case consideration of each state's needs remains the most appropriate path moving forward. Permitting blanket waivers to either law is dangerous and unnecessary.
The equity concerns exacerbated by COVID-19 must remain Congressional priorities beyond the pandemic. That means maintaining resources for expanding broadband access; extended, tailored learning time to accelerate learning; and keeping resources for students' and educators' nutritional, social, emotional, and mental health needs in place. This funding must be targeted towards the students that need it most. Additionally, the federal government must do more to promote diverse schools and classrooms, require data reported by schools, districts, and states to be disaggregated by race, and enforce students' civil rights during this uncertain time.
This is also the time to address the other structural inequities within our systems that have persisted for generations - long before COVID arrived. That means ensuring all students, but particularly students of color, have access to the critical resources they need to graduate ready for college and careers.
Congress must also support states and districts to advance equity in these areas:
Ensure Equitable Funding
As described above, districts serving large populations of students of color and students from low-income families receive far less funding than those serving White and more affluent students. Despite widespread attention to inequitable funding formulas -- and courts that have declared them unlawful-- too many states continue this unfair practice. Across the country, school districts with the most Black, Latino, and Native students receive roughly $1,800, or 13%, less per student in state and local funding than those serving mostly White students, and states and districts spend approximately $1,000 less per pupil on students educated in our nation's highest poverty districts than on those educated in the lowest poverty districts.
While money alone will not solve the deeply embedded systemic inequities our students face, it matters a great deal. Research shows that increased school spending leads to increases in graduation rates, higher wages, and a reduction in adult poverty, especially for students from low-income backgrounds. To ensure equitable funding systems, Congress must support states to: (1) provide funding according to student need; (2) provide more funding to districts with low property wealth; (3) ensure that dollars are used well to improve student learning experiences and outcomes; and (4) be transparent about the funding system's design and monitor funding to districts. In addition, since ESSA requires that all states and districts report school-level per pupil expenditure data on state and local report cards, Congress has an especially important role to support states in sharing clear and transparent data on the amount of funding that schools actually receive. For many states, 2020 is the first year that they will be sharing this critical data with the public; Congress must ensure that the U.S. Department of Education is providing support to states to meet this requirement and enforcing the law when states do not provide this information in a timely manner.
Access to Strong and Diverse Educators
Research shows that teachers are the single greatest in-school factor for student success. Students with the strongest teachers receive what amounts to months' worth of additional learning each year. We also know that all students benefit from having at least one teacher of color, and students of color are more likely to attend school regularly, perform higher on end-of-year assessments, be referred to a gifted program, graduate high school, and consider college when they have had a teacher of the same race or ethnicity. Unfortunately, thousands of Black and Latino students attend a school where they have no same-race teachers. Even larger percentages of White students attend a school without a Black teacher and/or Latino teacher.
To ensure all students have access to strong and diverse educators, Congress must support states to: (1) set - then meet - clear goals at the state and district levels to increase access to strong and diverse educators; (2) target resources to the districts and schools that struggle the most to provide students from low-income backgrounds and students of color with access to strong teachers; (3) target resources to diversify the teaching workforce; (4) set high standards for how teachers are prepared and licensed to improve teaching quality for students in high-need schools and in historically underserved groups; and (5) make educator quality and diversity data more visible and actionable.
In addition, Congress must increase funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs) and other Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs). These institutions prepare nearly 40% of Black teachers with bachelor's degrees in the United States. Congress should also fund the Augustus Hawkins Centers of Excellence Grant program for the first time since its creation in the bipartisan Higher Education Act of 2008. This program would provide critical funding to MSIs to provide increased and enhanced clinical experience and increased financial aid to prospective teachers of color, who, as detailed above, face higher burdens in college access and affordability than their White peers.
Access to and Success in Advanced Coursework
Research shows that when students are given access to advanced coursework opportunities, they work harder and engage more in school, and in turn have fewer absences and suspensions and higher graduation rates. And when these opportunities are provided to students of color, and their teachers receive training and supports, these students thrive alongside their peers. But, as shared earlier, too many Black, Latino, and low-income students, do not receive these opportunities.
To ensure all students have access to and success in advanced coursework, Congress must support states to: (1) use data to identify the barriers that prevent students of color and students from low-income families from enrolling in advanced courses and take action; (2) set clear and measurable goals for advancing access to and success in advanced coursework; (3) invest to expand advanced coursework opportunities -- both courses and seats; (4) require and support districts to expand eligibility for advanced courses; and (5) support Black, Latino, and low-income students' success in advanced courses. Congress can act now to close opportunity gaps in access to advanced coursework by creating and funding grants to states and districts that can be used to implement open enrollment, establish universal enrollment or universal screening for advanced courses and programs, support districts in launching additional courses and innovative models that allow all students to benefit, purchase materials; cover the costs of advanced coursework exams for students from low-income backgrounds; and prepare and support educators to teach these courses.
Equitable State Accountability, School Improvement, and Reporting Systems
Not too long ago, students from low-income backgrounds, students of color, English learners, and students with disabilities -- who had long gone underserved in our schools -- were invisible, hidden behind averages. In 2015, ESSA, building on earlier federal legislation, challenged states to refine their accountability systems to provide the right combination of pressure and support for school improvement. The law leaves many key decisions up to states -- decisions about what to measure, how to communicate how schools are doing on those measures, how to identify schools that need to take action to improve for any group of students, what to do to support school improvement efforts, and what to do if schools don't improve.
To ensure these systems are focused on supporting equity and achievement for all students, Congress must support states to: (1) only include indicators in state accountability systems that keep student learning front and center; (2) ensure that school ratings reflect how schools are doing for all groups of students; (3) establish criteria that honestly identify which schools need to take steps to improve overall or for one or more student groups; (4) provide meaningful support to schools that need to improve; and (5) report information that is understandable, easily accessible, and widely available. In particular, Congress must require states to administer statewide assessments during the 2020-21 school year. These assessments aligned to grade-level expectations are critical not only to helping families and educators understand how well students are learning, but also to supporting policymakers and leaders in identifying the places that are seeing promising results for all students so we can learn from those places.
Access to Equitable Learning Environments
Recognizing that school is where students spend the bulk of the time learning about themselves, their emotions and behaviors, and how to interact with others, over 90% of schools and districts report that they are working to support the social and emotional learning of students. Studies also show that social and emotional well-being is inextricably linked to the context in which students develop and the relationships they build over time. Too often, approaches to supporting social and emotional learning in schools ignore context, focusing solely on building specific skills (e.g., lessons on behavior). Ignoring context carries significant risks, especially for those students who are already underserved by our education system: students from low-income families, students of color, LGBT youth, students with disabilities, and English learners. Failing to acknowledge the influence of the learning environment, or failing to address the processes and structures in schools that disadvantage some students, may do more harm than good. Congress must support states and districts to provide all students with equitable learning environments that foster belonging, challenge students, and provide the supports students need to thrive. This means, for example, funding and providing meaningful professional development and coaching on topics such as reducing bias and anti-racist mindsets; improving working environments and conditions to retain educators of color; and ensuring equitable access to and supports for success in rigorous and culturally sustaining coursework.
In addition, we must recognize that for Black children, attending school is an act of racial justice. In early 2019, when the current administration rescinded school discipline guidance that was put in place explicitly to ensure that Black children were not pushed out of school buildings, it sent a loud and clear message that it is okay for educators and school leaders to exclude these students from opportunities to learn. Congress must renounce that message and instead proactively support states and districts in identifying and addressing disparate school discipline policies and practices.
Congress Needs to Enact Equitable Reforms to Higher Education
Allocate Funds to Allow for Safe Reopening, Relief for Students, and Enable Learning to Continue
In response to COVID-19, Congress took important steps in the CARES Act that should be maintained into next year. Congress should look to build on its initial higher education stabilization in CARES by allocating an additional $50 billion in aid to help keep students from suffering economic hardship and assist nonprofit colleges and universities to remain financially stable while preparing for a safe reopening. Those funds should also be allowed to assist students who are incarcerated, undocumented, or otherwise barred from federal financial aid under other circumstances.
Congress should also take direct action to enable postsecondary learning to continue. The pandemic necessitates a doubling of the Pell Grant in light of the increasing financial uncertainty facing students who may be forced to halt their studies due to a lack of funding. Additionally, in light of the FAFSA renewal rate dropping below prior years, Congress should work with the Department of Education, as seen recently in a bipartisan letter from four U.S. Senators, to figure out how best to streamline the filing process to remove financial obstacles for students and their families, especially those directly impacted by the pandemic. To enable home learning, Congress should include the Supporting Connectivity for Higher Education Students in Need Act in its next response package, which would direct $1 billion to institutions that are primarily serving students of color and students from low-income backgrounds to ensure that students at those institutions can get the home Internet access they need to continue their postsecondary education. Finally, Congress should provide dedicated funds to support student success and completion. This funding stream should support students' academic and social needs that have been impacted by the crisis, such as mental health services and supplemental academic support. This could take the form of bridge programs, co-requisite instruction, and/or supplemental academic support for Pell-eligible students to make up for lost learning and increase the number of available advisers and counselors.
The student loan relief provisions in CARES gave relief to millions of borrowers facing tremendous economic pressure in the face of the recession, and those should be extended into next year. Congress should build on that relief by extending equitable, targeted debt forgiveness to millions of borrowers who were already struggling and are facing a near insurmountable repayment burden in the wake of the recession.
Protect, Increase, and Expand Pell Grants
The Pell Grant program is the cornerstone of federal financial aid. Created in 1972 as the Basic Educational Opportunity Grant, the program benefits over 7 million students annually and continues to serve as the primary federal effort to open the door to college for students from low-income backgrounds. Over one-third of White students, two-thirds of Black students, and half of Latino students rely on Pell Grants every year. Pell Grant dollars are well-targeted to those in need: 83% of Pell recipients come from families with annual incomes at or below $40,000, including 44% with annual family incomes at or below $15,000.
The Pell Grant program's impact is shrinking as the maximum award has failed to keep pace with the rapidly rising cost of college. The purchasing power of the Pell Grant has dropped dramatically since the program's inception. In 1980, the maximum Pell Grant award covered 77% of the cost of attendance at a public university. Today, it covers just over 28%, the lowest portion in over 40 years. If the maximum award continues to stagnate, the grant will cover just one-fifth of college costs in 10 years.
Doubling the Pell Grant is a rational response to the enrollment downturn due to the pandemic and the steady erosion of the purchasing power of the award. After prioritizing that step, Congress should also make the following structural reforms: re-index it to inflation, as it was before 2017, move the program to the mandatory side of the budget to avoid potential discretionary cuts to a program that functions like a mandatory program, and expand it and other federal financial aid to students who are incarcerated and students who are undocumented to maximize education opportunity and help close equity gaps.
Increasing Equity Through Better Data and Funding Improvement Plans
Equity-focused accountability has the potential to refocus our higher education system on its most important purpose: successful outcomes for all groups of students. Congress must build upon current policy to create an accountability system that pushes institutions to serve students well, especially low-income students and students of color.
The first step in creating an equity-focused accountability system is maintaining and strengthening the protections we have in place currently. There is bipartisan support for closing the 90/10 loophole that sets up veterans as targets for predatory for-profits, and Congress should take that action, as well as moving the rule back to 85/15, per its original conception. Additionally, the recent gainful employment regulatory changes by the Department of Education removed the ability to hold accountable continuously poor-performing career education programs, and the recent borrower defense regulatory rewrite all but eliminated the right of defrauded or misled borrowers to get their federal loans discharged. Both of these changes should be reversed, and prior versions of the gainful employment rule and borrower defense rule restored.
In order to construct effective accountability and oversight systems, Congress must act to improve higher education data systems so they may provide reliable, consistent, and useable information. The bipartisan, bicameral College Transparency Act would overturn the ban on the creation of a student-level data system that would be immensely important in helping policymakers design systems that promote equity. Creating a student-level data system would make data on critical measures of student success like enrollment, persistence, retention, transfer, and completion, as well as post-enrollment outcomes such as earnings and employment, much easier to obtain and disaggregate by race, income, gender, ancestry, and other key criteria. The bill also contains privacy protections for sensitive student information essential to protecting the civil rights of all students.
In addition to maintaining and strengthening the accountability provisions currently in place, Congress must create pressure and provide support for the entire higher education system to improve, especially for the students from low-income backgrounds and students of color who are most likely to be underserved by today's system. Developing metrics that would establish minimum standards for institutions enrolling low-income students and students of color, and establish minimum standards for institutions regarding the performance, experiences, and outcomes for those low-income students and students of color are a prerequisite to holding institutions accountable for closing equity gaps in higher education.
However, any system that sets standards and walks away is one that is guaranteed to do damage to low-income students and students of color at institutions that need additional resources to respond to those standards. Investments in historically under-resourced institutions to support the implementation of evidence-based strategies that improve completion for students from low-income backgrounds and students of color are essential to making lasting, positive change for historically underserved students. In addition to investing more in Title III and Title V institutions, Congress should create a fund to support the development and scaling of interventions that improve completion.
Finally, take a rehabilitative approach to institutional improvement, not a punitive one. New standards that consider the reality that closing institutions can do tremendous damage to the students that are attending them should be implemented. This means consequences should be targeted at the programmatic level where possible, institutions should have time to adjust to new standards, continual growth and progress should allow for reduced consequences, and institutions that fail should be given support and the chance to submit improvement plans. However, when institutions are not meeting benchmarks, students, families, states and accreditors should be notified, and restrictions on enrollment and the elimination of Title IV eligibility must be on the table as eventual realities.
Investment in Student Success
Congress should invest in evidence-based policies to improve student success and close racial equity gaps. There is a growing body of evidence that wraparound support models like the City University New York's Accelerated Study in Associate Program (ASAP) are transformational for students. In New York City, ASAP nearly doubled three-year graduation rates for participants, up to 40% from 22%. While it required some upfront investment, due to the significant increase in graduation rates, CUNY ASAP drove down the cost per degree by 11%. These findings were replicated by three pilot programs in Ohio, which also nearly doubled three-year graduation rates and increased transfer rates to four-year colleges, and showed positive effects on enrollment, full-time enrollment, and credits earned. It also lowered the cost per degree. In order to scale these proven models, Congress should approve the Community College Student Success Act, which would provide grants to community colleges to scale ASAP-type programs. In addition to expanding ASAP, there are also promising practices around emergency student aid and microgrants that deserve further study, and Congress should support the development of these practices as well. Finally, students who are hungry cannot learn. Congress should make it easier for college students to enroll in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by eliminating the 20-hour work requirement that acts as a barrier for thousands of students.
Congress Must Protect Students' Civil Rights
The federal government has a vital historical role as the protector of civil rights and safety on college campuses. Colleges are venues for the exchange of ideas and the development and growth of students, not places where discrimination, hate crimes, or sexual assault are condoned. We support federal policies that encourage institutions to support a healthy campus racial climate, based on how accepted students feel on campus, how often they are able to engage across lines of difference, and how well the university supports diversity through events, clubs, and policies. Regular surveys of students and faculty on campus climate are essential practices to determine how to select and implement policies to ensure campus safety and equitable treatment. Federal, state, and institutional systems should include indicators that track and report incidents of bias or violence on campus. Federal requirements administered by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Offices of Civil Rights can also provide some of this data to help inform Congress as they look to address these issues.
In closing, we cannot underestimate the impact that this crisis will have -- and has already had -- on all of our students, but particularly our children of color and children from low-income backgrounds. They and their families are already bearing the brunt of the crisis.
More than 118,000 people in the United States have died of the coronavirus, and more than 33 million Americans have filed for unemployment during the pandemic. Both in terms of deaths and lost jobs, people of color are disproportionately affected.
When students do eventually return to brick-and-mortar buildings, there will be students at the K-12 and postsecondary levels sitting next to each other with very different levels of learning. Young students whose parents had the resources and flexibility to help them learn via high speed internet while school was closed, and those whose parents had to work, possibly on the front lines, to make ends meet and who had less reliable internet access during the crisis have had substantially different remote learning experiences. We must ensure that the latter receive the support necessary to get the quality education they deserve. College students who went home to comfortable surroundings and families that didn't require them to provide financial and/or caregiving support have structural advantages that students who must also juggle financial or caregiving responsibilities at home while trying to focus on their studies or are plagued by worries about how to pay for college and stay in school amid the pandemic do not. If there is a post-pandemic return to the old ""normal"" -- obscuring the inequities that we know exist -- we will have learned nothing. The old normal is no longer an acceptable option -- we must supply the resources and supports to ensure that equity gaps are closed for good.
If we fail to educate and protect students of color and students from low-income backgrounds, we have failed as a nation. We can choose to continue to shut out communities of color and low-income communities or we can make changes to allow for a more inclusive America -- one that protects the most underserved and allows everyone to reach their full potential.
The challenges facing us right now are significant, but they are not insurmountable. The Education Trust stands ready to assist and support you in the work ahead.
Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today. I look forward to taking your questions.
