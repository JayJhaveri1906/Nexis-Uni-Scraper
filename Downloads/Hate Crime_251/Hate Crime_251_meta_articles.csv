 The study, published in the European Economic Association, investigated how negative rhetoric about refugees on social media may have contributed to hate crimes against refugees in Germany between 2015 and 2017.
 ""We think our paper can only be a starting point for understanding how social media causes changes in our lives. Our findings on hate crime suggest that the stakes are high,"" said study author Karsten Müller from Princeton University in the US.
 In Germany, social media is among the main news sources of 18 to 25-year-olds. In the US, around half of all adults use social media to get news and two-thirds of Facebook users use it as a news source.
 In contrast to traditional media, social media platforms allow users to easily self-select into niche topics and extreme viewpoints. 
 This may limit the range of information people absorb and create online communities that reinforce similar ideas and viewpoints.
 The researchers measured anti-refugee sentiment on social media based on the Facebook page of the Alternative für Deutschland, a relatively new right-wing party that positions itself as anti-refugee and anti-immigration.
 The party is by far the most popular far-right political movement in Germany and with more than 300,000 followers, 175,000 posts, 290,000 comments, and 500,000 likes (as of early 2017), its Facebook page has a broader reach than that of any other German party.
 As the researchers show, the rhetoric about refugees on the Alternative für Deutschland Facebook page differs markedly from traditional news sources and in many cases contains language that prominent German non-governmental organisations have classified as hate speech.
 The researchers established that spikes in posts about refugees on social media are tightly linked to anti-refugee hate crimes, particularly in municipalities where people were more exposed to the Alternative für Deutschland page.
 This correlation was especially pronounced for violent incidents such as assault.
 Municipalities with Alternative für Deutschland users were three times more likely to experience an attack during the observation period.
 Out of the total 3,335 attacks on refugees in the same sample, 3,171 occurred in municipalities with Alternative für Deutschland Facebook page users.
 The authors found that, while anti-refugee attacks increased with anti-refugee posts, this relationship disappeared during the internet or Facebook outages.
 The researchers do not claim that social media itself causes crimes against refugees. Rather, the results suggest that social media can help propagate violent crimes by enabling people to spread extreme viewpoints.

However, two radical young lawyers may have handed the Trump Administration the perfect case to frame as domestic terrorism in the wake of the controversy over President Donald Trump declaring that he would designate Antifa a terrorist organization. I criticized such a designation as legally unfounded and constitutionally dangerous[2]. However, as we discussed yesterday[3], Colinford Mattis, 32, and Urooj Rahman, 31, may have supplied an alternative avenue in using ample federal laws to prosecute attacks as domestic terrorism without the need of any formal designation. The two defendants are expected to be released on bail today.[4]While many of us noted that a designation of a terrorist organization is generally a process handled by the State Department for 'foreign terrorist organizations,' commentary often ignored that such a designation is not needed to treat defendants as domestic terrorists (as opposed to trying to declare the amorphous Antifa movement as a terrorist organization).The case could be framed perfectly as a test case of the Administration treating defendants as domestic terrorists[5]under the definition insubsection 5 of 18 U.S.C. 2331:[6] The term 'domestic terrorism[7]' means activities that— (A)involve acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State; (B) appear to be intended—(i)to intimidate or coerce a civilian population;(ii)to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or(iii)to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and (C)occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States. 
Indeed, these attorneys may be accused of a terrorist trifecta under the governing law. They clearly acted in a way 'dangerous to human life [in] violation of the criminal law;' 'appear to be intended' to intimidate or coerce or to influence policy or affect conduct of mass destruction.' If the Justice Department is looking for a way to reframe cases as domestic terrorism this would seem the case that they are looking for. 18 U.S.C. 2332A also prohibits material support for acts of terrorism and the allegation that the two attorneys were attempting to hand out Molotov cocktails could be viewed as both as a case of direct terroristic acts as well as material support. The provision includes 57 different federal criminal statutes that the code calls 'federal crimes of terrorism.' Likewise, the Code of Federal Regulations at 28 C.F.R. 0.85 defines 'terrorism' as including 'the unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives.' The FBI has a long-standing policy [8]on handling such crimes as domestic terrorism and a policy to open parallel terrorism investigations in such cases. It guidelines include the following instructions thatThe FBI defines terrorism as an 'unlawful use of force or violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any element thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives.' The mission of the Domestic Terrorism Program (DTP) is to detect, deter, prevent, and respond to Domestic Terrorist Organizations (DTO) or individuals who threaten or conduct domestic terrorist activities within the United States. (See the forthcoming Counterterrorism Policy Implementation Guide.) (U) While HC investigations focus on crimes against a person or property and are motivated, in whole or in part, by the individual's prejudice against a race, religion, ethnicity, or national origin, DT investigations focus on crimes that are committed for political or social reasons by organized extremist groups. An example of a political agenda is an anarchist group carrying out activities to overthrow the government. Incidents related to a social agenda include criminal activities carried out by extremist groups in the animal rights or environmental movements. (U//FOLIO) When an HC occurs, and in an effort to bring consistency to classifying investigations that may be addressed under the CR and DT programs in which the subject has a nexus to any type of white supremacy extremist group, the investigation must have a dual captionThe Justice Department has previously declared defendants to be domestic terrorists, including members of white supremacist groups. There was no objection to that effort in the media or some commentators. Indeed, many encouraged the treating of such groups and cases as domestic terrorism. Many wanted the Charlottesville case treated as terrorism, as Attorney General Jeff Sessions referenced it in the same terms[9]. However, it was ultimately framed as a hate crime not terrorism in the prosecution and plea agreement of James Fields.[10] Likewise, the attack of Robert Bowers at the Pittsburgh Tree of Life synagogue was prosecuted largely under hate crime laws[11]. However, cases like the El Paso shooting were immediately framed as domestic terrorism investigations.[12] The case of two attorneys will likely appeal to the Justice Department as a demonstrative case for domestic terrorism. The defendants are less than appealing as lawyers who allegedly became law breakers. They had lives that many would relish. Mattis graduated from New York University School of Law in 2016 and received his bachelor's degree from Princeton University. He was also previously employed as an associate at Holland &#38; Knight. Rahman was just admitted to the New York bar in June 2019 after graduating from Fordham University School of Law. Rather than use their training to help others legally, they are accused of trying to distribute explosive or inflammable devices to attack police. In other words, from the perspective of the Administration, they walked right out of central casting for a domestic terrorism case highlighting such crimes as an attack on the very notion of the rule of law. As a criminal defense attorney, this would be a case that begged for a plea deal, but it is not clear that the prosecutors would be eager to bring the case to such an expedited closure. That is the particular irony here. These two young attorneys may have supplied the very case that the Administration was seeking at the very time it needed it was needed most.

JACKSON et al., 6:20-cv-14 Plaintiffs, (GLS/ATB) v. CITI TRENDS, INC., Defendant",FALSE,"Washington: UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT NORTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK has issued the following order:
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT NORTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ________________________________ DENISE J. JACKSON et al., 6:20-cv-14 Plaintiffs, (GLS/ATB) v. CITI TRENDS, INC., Defendant. ________________________________ SUMMARY ORDER Plaintiffs pro se Denise J. Jackson and Andre K. Jackson, Jr., mother and son, commenced this action against defendant Citi Trends, Inc. in New York State Supreme Court, Oneida County, (Compl., Dkt. No. 2), and Citi Trends subsequently removed the action to this court on the basis of federal question and diversity jurisdiction, (Dkt. No. 1). Plaintiffs alleged that Citi Trends violated their Fourth Amendment rights and “consumer rights,” and treated them with “bias[]” and “prejudic[e]. ” (Compl. at 2.) It was, and still is, difficult to discern exactly which claims plaintiffs brought against Citi Trends, as they merely wrote in generalities about the Fourth Amendment, “consumer rights,” and “hate crimes. ” (Id. at 1-3.) However, reading the complaint liberally given plaintiffs’ pro se status, the Case 6:20-cv-00014-GLS-ATB Document 35 Filed 11/09/20 Page 1 of 6 court assumed that plaintiffs attempted to allege the following claims: (1) a Fourth Amendment claim; (2) a claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C § 1981; (3) a claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C § 1983; (4) a New York State Human Rights Law claim; (5) a claim pursuant to Title II of the Civil Rights Act 1 ; and (6) an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim pursuant to New York State law. (Dkt. No. 22 at 4.) The court granted Citi Trends’ motion to dismiss in a June 5, 2020 Memorandum-Decision and Order (hereinafter “the June 2020 Order”). (Dkt. Nos. 12, 22.) However, “[g]iven their pro se status, and because, with the exception of the Title II claim, amendment may [have] cure[d] plaintiffs’ deficient claims,” the complaint was dismissed without prejudice and with leave to amend. (Dkt. No. 22 at 13.) Plaintiffs then filed a timely amended complaint, in which they, again, fail to specify the exact claims asserted against Citi Trends. (Am. Compl., Dkt. No. 23.) Now pending is Citi Trends’ motion to dismiss the amended complaint. (Dkt. No. 27.) The motion is granted, and plaintiffs’ amended complaint is dismissed for the same reasons explained in the June 2020 Order. (Dkt. No. 22.) Indeed, as argued by Citi Trends, (Dkt. No. 27, 1 See 42 U.S.C § 2000a. 2 Case 6:20-cv-00014-GLS-ATB Document 35 Filed 11/09/20 Page 2 of 6 Attach. 1 at 1), plaintiffs’ amended complaint does nothing to cure any of the defects that the court identified for them when dismissing their initial complaint. Plaintiffs do not allege that Citi Trends was a state actor or acted under color of state law, nor do they allege that they were prevented from purchasing items from Citi Trends. (See generally Am. Compl.) Rather, they merely renewed their request for an order compelling production of a certain video-recording of the incident in question,2 added an allegation that a Citi Trends employee used a racial slur towards them, and added new claims of “intentional tort” and “professional misconduct. ” (Id.) As noted in the June 2020 Order, plaintiffs’ claims pursuant to Section 1983, including the Fourth Amendment claim, must be dismissed because, viewing the amended complaint in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, Citi Trends, a private retail establishment, is not a state actor and 2 Plaintiffs, again, appear to claim that they will be able to prove their claims after discovery—specifically, after they are provided a video-recording of the relevant events. (Am. Compl.) But, as previously explained to plaintiffs on numerous occasions, “discovery is not for the purpose of finding a cause of action. ” See Perez v. Johnson, No. 07 Civ. 3761, 2008 WL 2876546, at *3 (S.D.N.Y July 23, 2008). Indeed, discovery is not needed at this phase of the litigation because the court accepts as true all allegations asserted in the amended complaint. See Goldstein v. Pataki, 516 F.3d 50, 56 (2d Cir. 2008). 3 Case 6:20-cv-00014-GLS-ATB Document 35 Filed 11/09/20 Page 3 of 6 was not acting under color of state law. (Dkt. No. 22 at 6-7); see Ciambriello v. County of Nassau, 292 F.3d 307, 323 (2d Cir. 2002) (“In order to state a claim under § 1983, a plaintiff must allege that [his federal statutory or constitutional rights were violated] by either a state actor or a private party acting under color of state law. ” (citation omitted)); White v. Monarch Pharm., Inc., 346 F. App’x 739, 740 (2d Cir. 2009) (“Private actors and institutions generally are not proper defendants to a 42 U.S.C § 1983 action, because they do not act under color of state law. ” (citation omitted)). Further, as explained in the June 2020 Order, to the extent plaintiffs assert a claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C § 1981, it must be dismissed because, accepting their allegations as true, plaintiffs were not prevented from purchasing anything from Citi Trends; rather, at most, their service was delayed. (Dkt. No. 22 at 8-10); see Benzinger v. NYSARC, Inc. N.Y.C Chapter, 385 F. Supp. 3d 224, 234 (S.D.N.Y 2019) (“Virtually all federal courts that have analyzed Section 1981 claims in the retail merchandise context have required the plaintiff to show that he was actually prevented from making a purchase. ” (quoting Rogers v. Elliott, 135 F. Supp. 2d 1312, 1315 (N.D Ga. 2001)); Hammond v. Kmart Corp., 733 F.3d 360, 362 (1st 4 Case 6:20-cv-00014-GLS-ATB Document 35 Filed 11/09/20 Page 4 of 6 Cir. 2013) (“[T]o satisfy the foundational pleading requirement for a [§ 1981] suit . . . a retail customer must allege that he was actually denied the ability either to make, perform, enforce, modify, or terminate a contract, or to enjoy the fruits of a contractual relationship, by reason of a race-based animus. ” (emphasis and citation omitted)). Finally, because all of the federal claims are dismissed by this Summary Order,3 and the court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over any state law claim due to the nascent nature of the action, such state law claims are dismissed as well. See Klein & Co. Futures, Inc. v. Bd. of Trade of City of N.Y , 464 F.3d 255, 262 (2d Cir. 2006) (“It is well settled that where, as here, the federal claims are eliminated in the early stages of litigation, courts should generally decline to exercise pendent jurisdiction over remaining state law claims. ” (citations omitted)). Accordingly, it is hereby 3 Plaintiffs continue to make general references to “hate crimes” in their amended complaint and in their response to Citi Trends’ motion to dismiss. (Am. Compl.; Dkt. No. 29 at 1-5.) Accordingly, the court will remind plaintiffs that “the federal criminal hate crime statute, 18 U.S.C § 249(a), does not create a private right of action. ” Pierce v. N.Y State Police (Troop D Lowville), No. 7:05-CV-1477, 2011 WL 1315485, at *7 (N.D.N.Y Apr. 4, 2011) (citations omitted). 5 Case 6:20-cv-00014-GLS-ATB Document 35 Filed 11/09/20 Page 5 of 6 ORDERED that Citi Trends’ motion to dismiss (Dkt. No. 27) is GRANTED; and it is further ORDERED that plaintiffs’ amended complaint (Dkt. No. 23) is DISMISSED; and it is further ORDERED that the Clerk close this case; and it is further ORDERED that the Clerk provide a copy of this Summary Order to the parties. IT IS SO ORDERED.

Mayor Bill De Blasio joined the community effort to paint the 'Black Lives Matter' road mural in bold yellow letters last Thursday but by noon Monday a man had defaced the area outside the President Trump's NYC residence, Trump Tower, Daily Mail reported.
The project carried out by young people wearing ""I Am Peace"" T-shirts last week, only last days before it was splattered in red paint.
Cops said the vandal was wearing a black shirt and black cap. The suspect dumped the paint then fled down 56th Street but it was smeared further - most of it across the letters ""K"", ""L"" and ""V"" - by passing vehicles.
The suspect reportedly escaped before law enforcement officers could catch up with him.
Police said they are reviewing surveillance footage and asked people to get in contact with any information. Crews were working to get rid of the damage on Monday afternoon.
The iconic skyscraper has been heavily-guarded since Trump delved into the world of politics. It has been the site of numerous protests, including one on Saturday where Trump supporters clashed with anti-racism protesters.
On Monday a man wearing and selling ""Dump Trump"" gear witnessed the property damage.
He was pictured standing nearby a man holding up a sign seemingly intended to gaslight people highlighting racial inequalities. It read, ""The only time black lives matter is when they are shot by a white policeman or an Oreo cookie. Defend all policemen"".
An ""Oreo"" is a derogatory term used against people of color, comparing them to the cookie which is classically brown on the outside and white on the inside.
The slur suggests the person exhibits behavior that the person judging aligns with being characteristically white.
The mural was one of five announced for New York City last month as part of an initiative to honor civil rights activists.
This month Trump expressed his opposition to the mural, saying it would denigrate the luxury shopping area. He also said it would ""further antagonize New York's finest"".
Before cops guarded the area while the mural was being painted, the president tweeted, ""Maybe our GREAT Police, who have been neutralized and scorned by a mayor who hates & disrespects them, won't let this symbol of hate be affixed to New York's greatest street.""
The decision came as Americans across the country expressed their hurt at statues and memorials to Confederate soldiers and slave-owners looming over public places for decades.
""When we say 'Black Lives Matter,' there is no more American statement, there is no more patriotic statement because there is no America without Black America,"" de Blasio said.
""We are acknowledging the truth of ourselves as Americans by saying 'Black Lives Matter.' We are righting a wrong,'"" he said.
Trump recently signed an executive order that would see anyone found to have tampered with a statue or monument face up to 10 years in prison.
It's unclear what the suspect's punishment could be. On Tuesday, the Contra Costa County District Attorney's Office charged David Nelson and Nicole Anderson with a hate crime after they destroyed a similar mural that was painted in Martinez, California on July 4.
""We must address the root and byproduct of systemic racism in our country. The Black Lives Matter movement is an important civil rights cause that deserves all of our attention,"" District Attorney Diana Becton said in a statement.
""The mural completed last weekend was a peaceful and powerful way to communicate the importance of Black lives in Contra Costa County and the country. We must continue to elevate discussions and actually listen to one another in an effort to heal our community and country,"" Becton added. - FNA"

When a good Samaritan tried to stop Saveljevs (inset), he responded, ""You f-king Black b--hes,"" according to prosecutors. Saveljevs also called Washington a ""Black b--h,"" before stabbing her, according to cops.

MARTIN SAVIDGE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It eclipses yesterday's record of 120. And now it is 125 today. Every single day it seems that there has been increased concern about the pandemic in this community.
But you wouldn't know it by anybody here. In fact, there are face masks that are for sale at some of these stalls, but it doesn't appear that anybody is taking them.
And the worry is by the Health Department and by the city officials you will have at least 20,000 people packing inside of the center. That's the venue for the president's rally.
Even though they will be handing our masks and sanitizer, it's expected that many people, those who support this protest are going to adhere to the policy, definitely not social distancing.
And so those packed inside for hours on end in the middle of a pandemic spike in this city, is just a recipe for disaster, according to medical officials, Brianna. And right, now they don't know how far it will spread after this event.
BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: Even the president admits that some people will get the virus from his event.
Martin, thank you, from Tulsa.
Across the country right now, marches, rallies and celebrations are under way marking the historic Juneteenth, which commemorates the end of slavery in America.
And it now comes amid growing demands for an end to systemic racism and police brutality.
CNN is on the scene coast to coast as people of all races, all ages, from all walks of life, are demanding change.
Let's go first to CNN's Pete Muntean at a rally in Washington.
Pete, tell us what you're seeing. PETE MUNTEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Brianna, this is just one of a dozen marches going on here in the District of Columbia today. This group is gathering in the shadow of the National Museum of African-American History and Culture.
They will march down Constitution Avenue, past the Washington Monument, all the way to the Lincoln Memorial. Of course, it was President Lincoln who signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
But it was two years before the slaves in Texas found out about their freedom.
This whole conversation about Juneteenth has really become a major part of this narrative about changing racial injustice in the country, changing police brutality in the country.
And we saw another march earlier with pro athletes, from the Wizards and the Mystics. We heard from Natasha Cloud, who is on that championship NBA, and she said that this is such an important time for the country, making a specific jab at President Trump, saying that folks here in the district need to get out and vote.
More pro athletes saying that they need to use their platform as players but really people first.
Cloud said they can remove her jersey, but she can't remove the fact that she is black. And she's trying to get more people involved in this conversation, more people out and marching.
This is the confluence of a weekend of events in Washington, D.C. They'll be marches on Saturday, marches on Sunday.
And one really powerful moment that happened, in that pervious march, everyone marched down to the Martin Luther King Jr memorial and said the names, said Breonna Taylor, said George Floyd, said Rayshard Brooks, in a somber moment, moment of silence that has really become crucially important in the center of power in the United States -- Brianna?
KEILAR: Pete, thank you so much. Pete Muntean.
I want to go now to Chicago and bring in CNN's Omar Jimenez.
You were at a Juneteenth rally there. Tell us good tell us about it, Omar.
OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Brianna. Yes, we're right on the scene of a Juneteenth rally her. I want to walk you up right to the front. You can see this line of the march that is about to happen right here.
As you see, right front and center, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, Senator Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth as well, all front and center for this march that is about to walk through downtown Chicago, right now, starting basically where the Columbus statue was, the one that was defaced over the course of the past few days. But again, this is a line for Juneteenth that the governor, J.B. Pritzker, just told me, moments ago, is going to -- we'll move off to the side here -- the governor said moments ago he wants to make Juneteenth a state holiday. As even we've seen many companies who have made Juneteenth a holiday over the over the course of this to give people the day off here in the city of Chicago.
But as we turn back around, again, I want to give you a glimpse of as they start marching, to the right, you see them. And if you turn the other way as well, you can see basically how far they are going to march. It will be about a long three or four block march through Chicago's Grant Park.
Again, people on the scene here, there are hundreds behind just the notable public figures that you see in front there.
And it is very clear, they wanted to make a statement both at the state level and at the city level that their leadership is very much in line with this movement, that their leadership very much cares about the issues at play right now.
And you look no further than the actual signs they are holding. George Floyd on one side, George Floyd on the other. His name is a spark point for what has been a movement generations in the making.
[13:35:06]
You look at the signs, ""No justice, not peace,"" ""Black Lives Matter."" Even white people showing up as well with signs that say, ""White silence is violence.""
It strikes me, in the words that Senator Tammy Duckworth said before this, it's one of the first times that we've seen people of all communities and colors acknowledging for the first time and agreeing that there's racism in this system. And we're seeing the manifestation of that now.
KEILAR: Thank you so much, Omar, for taking us there to this rally for Juneteenth in Chicago as it just gets under way there near Grant Park.
It was an innocent moment, white and black toddlers hugging each other. But now this beautiful moment has become politicized as the president shares a manipulated video of it. Hear the story behind this original video.
[13:40:56]
KEILAR: A presidential tweet running into trouble with Twitter for the third time in a month. This a portion of the Trump post that Twitter is labeling manipulated media. The video shows these two toddlers and presents it incorrectly as CNN coverage. It is not.
Going so far as to use a fake CNN graphic and misspelling, there as you see. It read, ""Terrified toddler runs from racist baby."" So the banner changes to racist baby probably a Trump voter.
Here is the thing, though, this was actually a really sweet beautiful story, two toddlers, best friends, one white, one black. Just so happy to see each other, hugging.
CNN and several media outlets covered the full version of the video last year. You can see for yourself.
Here is a version that CNN ran from our New York affiliate that originally aired the story, WPIX.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Twenty-six-month Maxwell and 27-month old Finnegan, pure joy at the sight of one another, running to hug each other much bigger than their size. The innocence of it all is why it is going viral.
MICHAEL CISNEROS, FATHER OF ONE OF THE BOYS: They just took off toward each other and I got my phone out as quickly as possible and I tried to record it. And they are just too cute together.
UNIDENTIFIED CNN CORRESPONDENT: Cute is an understatement. Michael Cisneros, Maxwell's dad, shot the video. He says he's not normally one to post private things but explains why he decided to in this case.
CISNEROS: With all the racism and hate going on, I just think that it is a beautiful video.
And the reason that it is getting attention, it is a little black boy and a little white boy. But if it can change someone's mind or just change their view on things, then it is totally worth it.
UNIDENTIFIED CNN CORRESPONDENT: At last check, it has gotten over 300 shares and 6500 views. The comments are mostly positive. But there are some naysayers.
CISNEROS: Definitely not staged. It was just a lucky moment that I got on camera. And now with all the attention, it will be a great story when he is older.
UNIDENTIFIED CNN CORRESPONDENT: The point-sized best friends have known each other for over a year now. It's a special relationship. And their parents are good friends as well.
(CROSSTALK)
CISNEROS: There's not anyone that comes close to Finnegan's status in Maxwell's eyes. Great to spread the love and show people that kind of love and beauty in the world.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KEILAR: And I want to discuss this now with CNN chief political analyst, Gloria Borger, who is with us.
It is such a sweet moment. I think especially as we need so many sweet moments right now during these hard times.
GLORIA BORGER, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST: Right.
KEILAR: It almost brings a sweet little tear to your eye.
And the president just took this and he made it so nasty. This is not the way the dad intended this. And he sort of stole this moment.
What do you think of this?
BORGER: Yes. Well, I think this is a president -- first of all, I think it is ridiculous and I think that it is sad actually because it was a sweet video of which the parents were so happy to present.
And this is a president who somehow finds it OK to retweet doctored videos without stopping to think, wait a minute, I'm the president of the United States here. Don't I have to confirm this? This is archived for example. Brianna, you know that.
And you know that he has retweeted doctored videos of Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden. And even though Twitter is now call willing him out on it, he doesn't seem to care.
KEILAR: And when I saw this, one of the things that I thought was it is not like he doesn't have someone very close to someone close to him talking about why this online nastiness is terrible.
Melania Trump has made this a cornerstone of her agenda as first lady. She said, at one point, let's face it, most children are more aware of the benefits and pitfalls of social media than some adults.
""In today's global society, social media is an inevitable part of our children's daily lives. It can be used in many positive ways but can also be harmful when used incorrectly.""
[13:45:08]
I mean, this is -she's saying this. She seems to get it. Her husband doesn't get it. They are parents of one boy together. He is the parent of -- and has grandkids who are little.
I mean, the idea that if something like this were used when it came to their kids in a justified way how much an uproar there would be. There seems to be no irony lost for the president.
BORGER: No, no irony lost.
Just this morning, OK, it is Juneteenth, just this morning the president is getting ready for his rally tomorrow. And what does he do? He delivers threats to people who intend to protest and says you won't be treated as gently as you were in New York or Seattle.
And what is that, Brianna? Telling people who -- you know, you said if you are looters or anarchists. But a lot of people there who want to protest peacefully, which is their constitutional right.
And instead of saying, you know, it is your constitutional right to protest, I hope you don't get violent, instead, he pours fuel on the entire situation and starts threatening them that they won't be treated well.
And that -- I don't know, is that bullying? What is that? Is that the kind of behavior you expect from a president?
KEILAR: No, no, it is not.
I will say, Gloria, I don't know how, but I totally miss that had video last year. So what I'm taking away from this, for the first time, I got to see this beautiful video of the two little boys and it warmed my heart.
BORGER: Exactly.
KEILAR: So that is what I'm walking away from this with.
BORGER: Me, too. Me, too.
KEILAR: Thank you for joining me.
Thanks, Gloria.
BORGER: Sure.
KEILAR: We have more on breaking news. Florida and Arizona setting records for the largest coronavirus surges. We'll take you there as the culture war over masks is boiling over.
Plus, the president reveals what he says is the greatest threat to his re-election.
[13:51:39]
KEILAR: Time is running out for Georgia state lawmakers to pass a hate crimes bill. There are bipartisan calls for the legislation. But a bill already passed in the House has stalled in the Senate.
Georgia is one of four states in the nation that does not have a hate crimes bill.
And the bipartisan calls come in the middle of the slaying of Ahmaud Arbery, a young black jogger in south Georgia, who was chased down by a trio of white men and shot to death.
The Arbery family attorney said they believe the killing was motivated by hate. All three men in the case have been criminally charged. And the DOJ is looking at a possible federal hate crime charge as well.
One of the loudest supporters of the law in Georgia is Republican state House speaker, David Ralston, and he's joining me now. Thank you, sir, for being with us.
STATE REP. DAVID RALSTON, (R-GA): Thank you, Brianna. Good to be with you.
KEILAR: As I mentioned, Georgia is one of just less than a handful of states that doesn't have a hate crime law. It used to have one, but then it was overturned by the state Supreme Court in 2004. Then there hasn't been one since.
Why has it been so difficult to move this along?
RALSTON: Well, I can't speak to that. I don't think there was a sufficiently strong effort made until 2019. And we decided at that point that, you know, this was really something we needed to join the rest of the nation in bringing into our law.
And I supported the efforts to pass a bipartisan bill. We passed that bill in March of 2019. And it's been in the state Senate now, for 469 days, hasn't had a committee hearing. We're running out of days.
But I'm still optimistic. I'm hopeful the Senate will choose to do the right thing and to pass this bill.
KEILAR: OK. So you're optimistic. And you're trying to get some of your Republican colleagues to move along on this, too. How can they still be opposing this when we've seen what's happened recently with George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery and other examples that show the need for something like this?
RALSTON: I can't speak for the state Senate. But I can tell you that many of the Republicans who were concerned about the bill in 2019 looked at it now in a much different light.
I expect that, you know, if we voted on that bill today in the House, that the Republican vote would be even stronger.
I think that, you know, no one can look at the Arbery video and to read the investigative reports of what happened in Brunswick that day and not come to the conclusion that this was hate when you have that kind of cold-blooded point-blank killing.
And then you have the shooter stand over the body of Ahmaud Arbery as he lay on the street dying and utter one of the most viral racial epithets you can imagine. And, to me, it's very, very clear that it's hate.
[13:55:04]
And that makes it very, very clear why we need to pass this bill.
KEILAR: I want to ask you about the upcoming election. The president said in an interview with ""Politico,"" out today, that mail-in voting would endanger his re-election and that it is the biggest threat to his candidacy. Back in April, you said, in reference to widespread absentee voting, quote, ""The president said it best. This will be extremely devastating to Republicans and conservatives in Georgia.""
I wonder now that you've seen what was really quite a debacle when it came to Georgia voting for the primary, and now you've seen the death toll from coronavirus and, obviously the, implications of that for standing in line for hours, if you've changed your mind?
RALSTON: Well, what I was getting at when I made those comments was the potential for fraud --
(CROSSTALK)
KEILAR: But what fraud?
RALSTON: Well, I'll give you an example. One of the employees in my law office got a ballot addressed to her address, but it had another person's name on it. You know, she could have voted that had she decided to.
KEILAR: Did she?
RALSTON: It's like -- excuse me?
KEILAR: I said did she. Because the reason I ask, and I take your point. But the Heritage Foundation, which is a conservative think tank, has done extensive voter fraud research. And what they found was just 10 cases of absentee ballot fraud in Georgia in the course of 22 years.
So there's really zero evidence of any sort of widespread voter fraud in this country like you say you're worried about.
RALSTON: Well, I don't know what they looked at. But I have heard anecdotally of many instances. That was one of them. She, by the way, did not vote that ballot. She did the right thing --
(CROSSTALK)
KEILAR: Well, they're looking at data, Mr. Speaker. So you're not looking at the data.
RALSTON: Well, you can make the data do anything you kind of want to.
I am concerned, I am still concerned about the potential for fraud with wide scale mail-in voting. And I'm going to remain that way until I'm convinced otherwise.
KEILAR: But you know that I'm citing a conservative think tank when I tell you about that data.
RALSTON: I know you're citing the Heritage Foundation. I don't disagree that their tradition has been conservative.
KEILAR: OK. But you don't believe their data? Is that fair? RALSTON: I have not reviewed their data. I have looked at other data. I can't tell you the exact sources of that today. But I also know what I hear from people in my community, and what I hear from people around the state of Georgia, who are concerned about this.
So it's not a partisan issue. I think it's more on issue of the possibility of fraud occurring and tainting our election process.
Now, you mentioned --
KEILAR: OK.
RALSTON: You mentioned the debacle in the primary. What we have done in the House of Representatives is I have instructed the Governmental Affairs Committee to conduct an independent investigation, not one that's run by the secretary of state or one that's run by the counties, to drill down in and bring back not finger pointing but facts.
Because there were many issues with that election, notwithstanding that we had a lot of mail-in voting, and there were problems with mail-in voting in that election.
And we have got to determine where they are. Frankly, at this point in time, you know, I'm not pre-judging where they are.
KEILAR: But we've heard accounts of people struggling to get absentee ballots, requesting them multiple times, for instance, in the Atlanta area, the Augusta area as well, not being able to get their absentee ballots.
I guess I just wonder. you saw the lines. You saw the lines of people waiting for hours. And we saw this in some predominantly black areas of Georgia.
I guess I wonder, because we have you on here talking about hate crimes. You talk convincingly about wanting to protect black Georgians from hate crimes. Why not want to protect them from the coronavirus, a disease that is disproportionately killing African-Americans?
RALSTON: Well, I do want to protect them from that. That's why we've taken measures during this session to do that. My desire to protect Georgians from the COVID-19 is not based on or influenced in any way by racial considerations.

The statement says that NRI Ambedkarites are “seething with rage, pain and sadness at the brutal caste hate crime against a 19-year-old girl from the scheduled caste community… We offer our condolences to the family of our sister from Hathras,” it stated.Citing reports of other heinous rape crimes again on Dalit girls in Balrampur and other places, the organisations have demanded “immediate prosecution of the criminals under the SC/ST Atrocities Act”. “As per the National Crime Records Bureau statistics, the crimes against dalits rose by 746% from 2006 to 2016. The caste motivated rapes and murders of dalit women form major proportion of such crimes. The cases pending investigations were up 99% and the police were half as likely to help,” the statement reads.They called on the government to take initiatives along with community leaders to eradicate caste hate, restore law and order in UP and the country and “create a safer space for women, and provide equal opportunities to all its citizens along with additional safeguards for the scheduled castes and tribes”.Mahesh Wasnick, coordinator of these protests, told TOI from the US that members have protested at several places in America and Europe.
“We are going to submit a memorandum to United Nations and New York. We are also organizing virtual protests. All Ambedkarite, Bahujan and Muslim and many local organizations are supporting us. It is not for the cause of any community but humanity itself,” he said.

Ricky Bellevue - whose arrest on a Rockaways boardwalk led to a cop facing criminal charges for violating the state's chokehold ban - was arrested Friday on robbery and other charges.
It's Bellevue's second new arrest in a month. On July 7, he was hit with hate-crime robbery and assault charges for attacking a gay couple in the Bronx, police said.
He was released on $8,000 cash bail July 22. On Thursday morning, he robbed a teenage girl on the A train at the Beach 44 St. station in Far Rockaway, police said.
Bellevue, 35, asked the victim for money, and when she refused, grabbed her backpack and warned ""I am going to shoot and cut you!"" according to a criminal complaint. Police later recovered her backpack, which contained her sneakers and iPad.
Cops caught up with Bellevue (inset) in a Bronx deli Friday, and charged him with the robbery and possession of stolen property in an unrelated credit card theft.
He was arraigned Sunday in Queens Criminal Court, and ordered held on $50,000 bond or $25,000 cash bail.

At around 9 p.m. on Sunday, the assailant, Osman Butt, allegedly grabbed an Israeli flag from outside the synagogue and smashed it through the synagogue's windows. He then reportedly broke in and vandalized the synagogue, while destroying several items and symbols marking the holiday of Sukkot. 
 The synagogue's director, Susan Altman, told the Brooklyn Paper that the attack is a disaster for the synagogue, which is experiencing financial difficulties as it is. 
""We're a poor shul. We don't have the funds to replace our glass. I don't know how we're going to get out of this,"" Altman said. 
The incident was reported to police by the building's custodian, who found the intruder wrapped up in the Israeli flag while trying to break the flagpole, throwing objects and shouting antisemitic slurs. 
The alarmed custodian rushed to call police, who arrived to the scene and comprehended Butt at 9:11 p.m. inside the synagogue.
Butt now faces six charges, including burglary, criminal mischief, and criminal trespassing, with three charges being classified as hate crimes - dramatically increasing the penalties that Butt faces. Butt's burglary charge for instance, which would typically be a Class D felony and carry a maximum of seven years in prison, has instead become a Class C felony, which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years.

But that doesn't change the impact that the attack has had on the local Jewish community, with many members afraid to go to the synagogue alone, Altman said. 
""A lot of our members are concerned, we're scared,"" Altman said. ""I'm here today, and I can't stop looking out the window.""
Altman noted that the area is usually peaceful, pointing at the fact that it will take some time until the shocked community returns to normal. 
""The temple is like a hidden secret, it's in the middle of a residential area. It's very quiet. There's never any crime around here,"" Altman said. 
Only two other suspects were arrested for antisemitic hate crimes in the area since the beginning of 2017, according to NYPD statistics.
Altman noted that efforts have already been taken in order to enhance the building's security and make members feel safe.

The Shore Parkway Jewish Center synagogue is located in Gravesend, Brooklyn, one of the many neighborhoods with large Orthodox Jewish populations that New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said would be forced to enter lockdown for the second time, in an effort to combat the spread of coronavirus. 
The mayor noted, however, that at this point houses of worship are not part of the closure plan and will be allowed to remain open.

The hate-fueled motorist slapped another firefighter's arm and blocked a firetruck inside the bays at Engine Company 211-Ladder Company 119 on Hooper St. in South Williamsburg during his rampage as the Bravest squared off with the unhinged man last Sunday, according to officials.
Jacob Deutsch, 55, allegedly hurled the racial epithet at the 42-year-old firefighter and threatened to ""go to war"" against the man's colleagues after he was threatened with a summons for pulling his brand new Acura in a spot reserved for FDNY vehicles.
But authorities said Deutsch did not go quietly.
""Hey a----, don't write a ticket!"" he screamed during the 10 a.m. confrontation, according to court papers. As he pulled out of the first spot, Deutsch then parked directly outside the firehouse's bay doors, blocking a fire truck that was pulled outside to be washed. He then allegedly exited the vehicle to threaten the firefighters.
""If you want to go to war we can go to war!"" Deutsch screamed, according to court papers. ""I can have 300 Hasidic men on the block in an hour!""
Deutsch slapped a firefighter's arm before climbing behind the wheel and opened the car door as he drove off, deliberately striking the firefighter in the leg, officials charged. The FDNY employee was briefly hospitalized with injuries to his knee, hamstring and thigh, officials said.
The suspect drove down the street, abandoned the vehicle and fled inside a nearby community center. Cops identified Deutsch through his license plate, and he surrendered Thursday with his lawyer at a downtown Brooklyn police precinct.
The suspect was charged with assault, menacing, obstructing government administration, leaving the scene of an accident and other offenses.
While he dropped an N-bomb during the clash, he was not arrested on hate crime charges because his actions were not motivated by racial hatred, a law enforcement source said. A Brooklyn Criminal Court judge ordered him held on $35,000 at his late Thursday arraignment.
Deutsch's wife insisted the entire incident was overblown and laid the blame on firefighters for instigating the argument.
""Those [firefighters] are acting very, very immature,"" she told the Daily News. ""They grew up to be what they wanted but they did not grow up in maturity.

Mark David Hutt was charged with criminal mischief after officials said he threw white paint over a section of the mural on Sunday morning.
The suspect began using his hands to smear the paint across the mural shortly after 10am, NYPD detective Carrie Reilly told CNN. 
The Black Lives Matter mural - a project Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered after a similar painting was unveiled on the streets leading up to the White House - has become a controversial flashpoint on the city's iconic Fifth Avenue. 
While some have celebrated the show of support for the Black Lives Matter movement amid nationwide anti-racism protests sparked by the death of George Floyd, others - including Black Lives Matter activists - have lambasted the project as performative, instead calling for critical police reform. 
President Donald Trump also described the painting as a ""symbol of hate"", drawing significant blowback from his critics.
There have been at least four reported incidents in which the New York mural was defaced in apparent acts of opposition to the project. The New York City police department has meanwhile paid officers overtime to protect the mural, according to reports. 
One man was seen dumping a can of red paint in the middle of the mural in mid-July, forcing the city's Department of Transportation to scrub the painting clean. 
The mayor condemned the vandalism in a statement that said the Black Lives Matter movement ""is more than words, and it can't be undone"".
Other Black Lives Matter murals across the country have faced similar vandalism as protests continued over the death of Mr Floyd, a 46-year-old unarmed black man who was killed after a white police officer was caught on camera kneeling on his neck.
Earlier this month, a man and woman seen painting over another Black Lives Matter mural in California were charged with a hate crime, as well as a violation of civil rights, vandalism, and possession of tools to commit vandalism, according to the Contra Costa County District Attorney's Office. "

Hate crimes in the United States reached the highest level in a decade in 2019",FALSE,"Hate crimes in the United States reached the highest level in more than a decade last year,while more hate killings were recorded than ever before, according to the FBI.
 The sharp increase in hate-driven killings - there were 51 last year, according to the FBI - was largely attributed to the mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, in August 2019. Authorities say that, in that attack, a 21-year-old boy driven by hate toward Latinos stormed a Walmart, killed 23 people and injured many more.
 The death toll of the El Paso bombing more than doubled that of Pittsburgh's deadliest hate crime of 2018, the mass shooting of Jews at Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue.
 In total, the FBI collected data from 7,314 criminal incidents motivated by race, ethnicity or gender identity bias in 2019. It was the third year in a row that this measurement exceeded 7,100 incidents and was the highest figure since the FBI recorded 7,783 incidents in 2008.
 Experts argue that FBI data is likely to underestimate the number of hate crimes in the United States, both because many victims do not report the incidents and because local agencies are not required to forward hate crimes data to the FBI.
 For example, last year only 2,172 agencies reported hate crimes data to the FBI, out of a total of more than 15,000 security agencies across the country, according to the FBI report. (Among the major omissions in the data of recent years is the death of a protester in 2017, during a concentration of white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia.) ""It's important to note that, due to the nature of the hate crimes report, the FBI's annual report greatly underestimates the actual levelof hate crimes in the country,"" said the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which tracks hate groups on Monday.
 The SPLC noted that the increase in hate crimes in recent years has occurred as white supremacist groups multiply. According to data collected by the centre, the number of white nationalist groups increased by 55% between 2017 and 2019.
 Last year's rise in war crimes highlighted the upward trend in prejudice-driven crimes during the Trump era,and the harsh rhetoric against Latino immigrants was seen as the motive that propelled the perpetrator of the El Paso shooting.
""Politics has a role,""said Brian Levin, a professor at California State University in San Bernardino (CSUSB) and director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at that study house.
 ""The president's speech has been identified in a series of attacks that have occurred,"" Levin added, ""but also the day-to-day growth of hate crimes recorded by the FBI shows that there are increases after sustained and fervent statements by the president entering an internet feedback circuit that also ends in other speeches, both in the workplace and on television.""
 The total increase was fueled by an increase in attacks in particular against Hispanics and Jews. The FBI reported 953 anti-Semitic hate crimes that occurred last year, representing a 14% increase over the previous year and the highest figure since 2008, according to a CSUSB report that analyzes the latest FBI report and was released Monday.
 Hate crimes against Latinos rose by nearly 9%, from 485 incidents in2018 to 527 last year. At the same time, hate crimes against black people fell to the lowest percentage of total hate crimes since the FBI began gathering such data, although blacks were still very overrepresented in statistics, according to Levin's report. Last year, hate crimes against black people fell slightly, less than 1%.
""Blacks remain the No. 1 target,with a level that doubles that they represent in the American population,"" the report specified.
In analyzing preliminary data from 2020, Levin observed general declines in hate crimes, a fact he explained as a result of social estating measures and the closure of shops due to the coronavirus pandemic, except in three cities: Los Angeles, Houston and San Antonio. And he also found this year increases in prejudice crimes against two particular groups, transgender people and Asian Americans; the latter, he said, have more likely been affected by anti-Asian sentiment caused by false claims about the pandemic.

He claims to be 6ft, which is curious because he seems to be shorter than me and I am definitely 5ft 8in. Not that size matters.
In the past, McCall, 36, usually looked after celebrities and the wealthy. Now, nervous New Yorkers of middling means are hiring personal security guards to escort them about their daily lives. I was intrigued to try the service myself.
It seems an extreme measure, but the Big Apple - where some shop fronts remain boarded up, three weeks after the presidential election - certainly feels rattled after a year of coronavirus devastation (there have been more than 24,000 deaths in the city so far), antipolice riots, chaos over the polls and an alarming spike in violent crime.
I live on the top floor of a tall apartment building, yet my flatmate recently woke at 1am, terrified, to find a man directly outside her bedroom window, ranting at the wind. Having climbed up the fire escape, seemingly high on drugs, he kept trying to clamber onto our rooftop.
With jangled nerves, we have been watching the Manhattan murder mystery The Undoing through our fingers, and shuddering as Nicole Kidman's character takes her solitary, late-night walks through the city.
The Sky Atlantic drama, which has its finale in the UK tomorrow, is not one to watch for those in the city who are currently too anxious to leave their apartments (something a friend's wife is enduring).
The idea that ""New York is over"", as one fabulously wealthy heiress recently told me, is ludicrous, but these days it seems everyone has a New York nightmare to share.
""New Yorkers used to need a shrink and meds; now it's a shrink, meds and a bodyguard,"" said a colleague born and bred in the city, who suggests security details are a new status symbol.
McCall, who runs the McCall Risk Group, tells me after-dark jobs typically involve escorting groups of female friends on nights out. The business in looking after ""average Joes"" has increased 80% in the past year, he said.
""It's everybody from corporate executives to tourists to housewives who want to go out and do some shopping but they're afraid,"" said McCall, who lives outside the city in Westhampton with his wife and four children.
The hourly rate is $50 (£38) and you can specify the type of bodyguard you are after: plainclothes or suited, male or female, imposing physique or someone who will blend in easily. Male clients will often request female security: ""Some guys are a little embarrassed - they're in pretty good shape and feel emasculated, so ask us to tone it down and send someone who's not intrusive.""
Many customers want to be chaperoned on their daily commute. Pasquale Cosenzo, a computer programmer, is accompanied by one of McCall's agents for the short walk between Penn station and his office in midtown Manhattan.
""It's not that I can't handle myself - I don't want to deal with it,"" said Cosenzo, 48. ""I can't risk my safety, my family's safety or my co-workers' safety because I get into an argument with some guy who's on drugs or mentally ill.""
He and two female colleagues hired protection after a friend of one of the women was assaulted in the neighbourhood.
Certainly, the homelessness crisis around Penn station is stark, but it seems more sad than scary. ""There's a lot of drug use, urinating, defecating - a lot of people running around with no clothes on, even in temperatures like this,"" said McCall. The thermometer now hits 5C at night.
He recalled a stabbing last weekend: ""The person appeared to be an EDP [emotionally disturbed person] and he went up and stabbed this person several times with a knife. Our client saw it, froze. We had to physically move him.""
According to New York police, murders are up 37% this year compared with the same period in 2019, and the number of shootings has more than doubled. However, robbery, assault and hate crimes are all down.
Criminologists dismiss the oftrepeated narrative that New York is slipping back into the crime-ridden hellhole it used to be. ""Total crime is down 82% from 1990, so we are certainly not backsliding into the lawlessness that people fear from the 1990s,"" said Christopher Herrmann, an assistant professor at the city's John Jay College of Criminal Justice. ""This isn't a numbers thing - it's a perception thing. If you can afford the personal security and want to feel 'safer', I'm glad to hear there are companies providing this service.""
McCall and his agents, many of whom have backgrounds in law-enforcement, provide reassurance in fractious times. ""We give clients peace of mind,"" said McCall. ""We want to keep them away from any bad elements, and from seeing any bad elements.""

 The number of homebuyers purchasing apartments in Manhattan has dropped by 46 per cent in the third quarter amid pandemic lockdowns and soaring crime, with many instead flocking to the New York suburbs and to Florida.According to data from Compass, some 10,000 homes are currently up for sale in Manhattan, a new record.Even before the pandemic, there was a glut of high-end apartments needing to be sold in the city. But the inventory of unsold apartments now continues to rise as new listings hit the market, CNBC reports. Current luxury apartments on the market would take nearly three years to sell, according to a report from Miller Samuel and Douglas Elliman. 'There is no shortage of apartments for sale, but there is a shortage of buyers,' said Jonathan Miller, CEO of Miller Samuel.There were only 1,375 total sales in the third quarter of the year. The number of sales is 44 per cent down from just a year prior. 
Signed contracts for September also fell 42 per cent in Manhattan from last year, according to Miller Samuel.Manhattan has been hit with high unemployment and growing problems with sanitation and public transit and has only had 10 per cent of workers return to their office buildings. The city has also been hit by a massive surge in crime. As a result, buyers are hesitant to purchase homes.As the city looks to possibly raise taxes in a bid to save budget holes impacting NYC and the state, more buyers are looking to spend their real estate dollars elsewhere. Contracts signed in the Hamptons have gone up 76 per cent in September, compared to last year. In Westchester County, New York, purchases have increased by 56 per cent while they have risen some 36 per cent in Fairfield County, Connecticut. Florida has also seen an increase surge in buying, with signed contracts going up 62 per cent in Palm Beach County and 21 per cent in Miami-Dade County.In addition to urban flight, Manhattan brokers have mislead the public by touting a 'buyer's market' in Manhattan for months. They've claimed that prices were going to drop and continue to do so, in a bid to entice those who have been looking to buy for a while. The average sale price in Manhattan rose 32 per cent in the third quarter to $2.18million. The median sale price also increased by seven per cent to $1.1million. Statistical flukes are responsible for the increase, according to analyst. 2019's city mansion tax depressed third quarter sales at the time. Hyper-priced deal closings at the new luxury condo tower at 220 Central Park South also contributed to the prices. Analyst say a more accurate reflection of price drop comes from the average discount between the asking price and sale price. Apartments in the third quarter sold an average discount of nine per cent, compared to five per cent before the pandemic. Average price-per-square foot in Manhattan did rise in the third quarter. This suggest that prices may drop further before buyers should rush in. 'If you look at 2009 and then Sept. 11, the sellers can take a few years to adjust,' Miller said.Miller added that he doesn't expect prices to fall more than about 10 per cent. Prior to the pandemic, prices had already gone down 15 per cent from the peak of 2015-2016. Buyers will hopefully be incentivized to purchase by the time the price is down from 25 per cent from that point. 'But that all depends on quality-of-life issues like policing, sanitation and public transportation,' he said. 'I don't see an improvement in the market in the fourth quarter. But I think we could see notable improvement in 2021.'Murders in New York City increased by 76% in September compared to last year and shootings skyrocketed by 127%, new crime statistics reveal
Murders in New York City rose 79 percent last month compared to last year, and shooting incidents soared 127 percent, according to new NYPD crime statistics.
The citywide crime stats released on Friday show that New York's summer crime wave continued into September, as the city continues to grapple with a disturbing rise in violence.
Tensions in the city remain high after months of coronavirus lockdowns, economic misery and unrest in the streets, causing petty disputes to frequently escalate quickly into violence. As well, police say that gang violence has been a major factor in the rise in shootings.
There were 152 shooting incidents across the city in September, compared to just 67 such incidents in the same month last year, a 127 percent rise, the data shows. Over the first nine months of 2020, shootings were up 91 percent.
Also last month, there were 51 murders in New York, compared to 29 in September of last year, an increase of 79 percent.
Through September 30, there were 344 murders in the city, compared to 246 murders in the first nine months of 2019, an increase of 40 percent.
Burglaries also rose an alarming 38 percent in September, and were up 42 percent for the year through September 30.
Overall, index crimes rose just 2 percent in September, with the rise in shootings and murders counter-balanced in part by declines in hate crimes (down 33 percent so far this year) and reported rapes (down 19 percent in September).
Police say that sex crimes continue to go under-reported, and urge victims to come forward by contacting the NYPD Special Victims Division. 
In a press release, the NYPD touted its strong enforcement efforts, saying that gun arrests rose 98 percent in September from the same month last year. 
'NYPD officers have achieved this record level of enforcement despite the approximately 2,500 officer reduction in manpower-from attrition and no new academy classes-as well as a 59 percent cut to the uniformed overtime budget,' the department said.
Previously, Police Commissioner Dermot Shea has directly blamed Mayor Bill de Blasio's $1 billion cut to the NYPD budget for the city's recent surge in crime.
The $1 billion budget cut resulted in policing funds being reallocated to education and social services over the next year. "

(AP) — Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday he was ""outraged"" by a violent assault on a 30-year-old transgender man in Rochester and was ordering the State Police Hate Crimes Task Force to aid in the investigation.
Samson Tequir, a local Black Lives Matter organizer, sustained a broken eye socket and multiple facial fractures in the attack last Friday, which he said may have been partially live streamed on social media.
Tequir was attacked around noon as he and his partner walked home from a corner store. Police released surveillance video showing two suspects, but no arrests have been made. The assailants made anti-gay remarks, he said.
“My story is not new,"" Tequir told the Democrat and Chronicle, citing a rise in gender-identity bias crimes. “It is not the last one, and I can look around the room I am in right now and find more of those stories just the same.”
Tequir faulted a slow police response for allowing the assailants to get away.
There was a 36-minute lag between the time a 911 call was placed and when officers were dispatched, which the police department said was because they were tied up on other jobs. It took another eight minutes for officers to arrive.
Rochester Police Chief La'Ron Singletary said in a statement Wednesday that the department was “utilizing every resource to investigate and apprehend the person(s) responsible for this heinous crime committed in our community.” He added that the police department has no tolerance for any crimes, “let alone a crime that is committed because of an individual's identity.”
Cuomo said in a statement that the state police task force will provide “any and all resources necessary to bring the assailants to justice.”
“I am outraged by reports of an assault against a 30-year-old black transgender man in Rochester,"" Cuomo said. “New York will never tolerate such rancorous acts of hate.”"

BERLIN — Prospective gun buyers in Germany would have to undergo background checks to ensure they have no ties to extremism and social media companies operating in the country would be required to report suspicious posts under a series of proposals advanced Wednesday by Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government. 
The legislation comes amid a recent spike in far-right crime. In June, a conservative politician, whose name had appeared on a neo-Nazi hit list circulated online, was fatally shot in the head in what officials believe was the country’s first far-right political assassination since the Nazi era. And just three weeks ago, a right-wing gunman killed two people after attacking a synagogue in Halle on Yom Kippur.
“The threat from far-right extremism and far-right terrorism, and with them anti-Semitism, is high in Germany and we can’t stress it often enough,” Horst Seehofer, Germany’s interior minister, said at a news conference. 
The bulk of far-right attacks in recent years have consisted of anti-Semitic crimes and hate crimes targeting foreigners and those who support them. The far right has scapegoated immigrants as dangerous and broken longstanding taboos about using language that echoes that of the Nazis. This has come despite more than a decade of German economic prosperity and the country’s persistent ranking as one of the safest in the world.
Alternative for Germany, a far-right party, has stoked public anxiety over the 2015 arrival of more than a million, mostly Muslim, refugees and closed ranks with neo-Nazis during street protests. After the synagogue attack, mainstream parties criticized the far right for contributing to the increase in violence by using aggressive language. 
The proposals must still be approved by Parliament, where Ms. Merkel’s government holds a majority. It is expected to pass.
The legislation would further toughen the country’s strict 2018 law against online hate speech. The law passed last year requires companies running social media platforms, including Facebook, Google and Twitter, to remove “obviously illegal” content within 24 hours, or face fines of up to 50 million euros, or about $56 million. 
Under the proposed legislation, just removing the posts would no longer be enough — companies would also be required to report any such content to the authorities. Germany’s federal police plan to establish a new department that would collect the reported content and the I.P. addresses — the numbered codes that differentiate individual internet connections — of those posts.
Spreading insults and hate-speech online would also carry stiffer sentences, reflecting the “unlimited reach” of such comments. 
“It cannot be that there is fertile ground in this country for hate and incitement,” said Christine Lambrecht, the country’s justice minister.
Germany already has strict gun laws that forbid the production of weapons and require extensive training and a permit to purchase a firearm. Nevertheless, authorities found last year that more than 790 people considered far-right extremists held a weapons permit. Under the proposed legislation, those permits could be revoked.
The proposed legislation would also make attacks on local politicians and first-responders or emergency medical personnel a separate crime. Along with police officers and fire fighters, both groups have increasingly become the target of violence — from both the left and the right — while trying to carry out their jobs.
Germany’s domestic intelligence agency considers an estimated 24,100 people in the country to be right-wing extremists. About half of them have the potential to become violent, authorities believe. 
Critics charge the proposals do not go far enough to prevent people from turning extremist in the first place, despite its pledge of 115 million euros annually through 2023 for projects promoting democracy. But the legislation, they said, would not have prevented the attack on the synagogue.
The man accused in the attack, Stephan Balliet, did not have a previous record and was not on authorities’ radar before he tried to carry out a massacre of Jews on Yom Kippur, the holiest day on their calendar. Authorities believe that he was radicalized online and built or printed on a 3D printer several of the weapons that he used in the attack — one of the reasons that authorities believe more people were not harmed. 
“I don’t want to imagine how things would have turned out with professionally made weapons,” Mr. Seehofer said of the attacker. “Nor do I want to think about how things would have turned out if we had American gun laws.”

David Peralta required emergency brain surgery following the 24 August (20) clash with Charles Harrison Streep, who reportedly chased down the 18 year old and his girlfriend and savagely assaulted him in the parking lot of a Chase Bank in East Hampton.
Peralta's attorney, Edmond Chakmakian, claims Streep ignored a stop sign and almost collided with the youngster's new red Ford Mustang, and then tried to place the blame on his client, before following the couple to the bank and confronting the driver.
""(Streep) said something to the effect of, 'What are you, 14 years old?'"" Chakmakian told the New York Post, alleging the 31 year old then spat offensive racial epithets at the American-born Ecuadorian and beat him up.
""After (Peralta) was unconscious, he lifted up his limp body and slammed it onto the ground,"" Chakmakian said. ""It was an absolutely obscene display of anger and violence.""
Police were called to the scene and the teen initially refused medical treatment, but ended up needing to be airlifted to hospital and rushed into surgery to relieve pressure on his brain due to a bleed.
According to Chakmakian, the college student received help just in time: ""If he was there 20 minutes later, he would not have made it or he would've been left in a vegetative state,"" the attorney stated, revealing the aspiring detective now has a long road to recovery. ""He's never going to be the same. He's lucky if he finishes college.""
""He was looking forward to starting his sophomore year,"" Chakmakian added. ""Instead, he's starting years of physical therapy, cognitive therapy. He's got medical bills hanging over his head in excess of $80,000.""
Chakmakian is currently appealing to the Suffolk County District Attorney to add hate crime charges to the felony case against Streep, who was arrested on second-degree assault and strangulation counts days after the incident.
He is also planning to file a civil suit against Streep on behalf of his client.
Streep is the son of the Mamma Mia! star's youngest brother, Dana Streep, and his wife Mary."

Chief Judge Janet DiFiore announced during her weekly update today that in areas outside of New York City, the court system has begun summoning grand jurors to report for service on July 13.
“This milestone development follows several weeks of careful planning and coordination with our justice partners, during which we have identified and retrofitted appropriate space and developed new protocols to ensure that grand jury proceedings will be safely conducted,” said DiFiore.
DiFiore also said she’s wasting no time in calling upon the expertise of their new Commission on the Future of New York’s Courts, led by NYSBA’s Immediate Past President Hank Greenberg, to fast-track a report with guidance and recommendations on how the state court system can safely restart jury trials.
“The right to a jury trial is one of the pillars of our justice system, and we have an obligation to be proactive and creative in order to restore this fundamental right as soon as it is safe to do so,” said DiFiore. “And I want to thank the Commission for turning their attention to this immediate challenge and concern.”
DiFiore also reported today that the court system has added 14 new virtual parts to their very busy New York City Family Court, which she said more than doubles their virtual capacity from 11 parts to 25, with most of those parts dedicated to hearing neglect and abuse, family offense and child support proceedings.
“These are urgent, time-sensitive matters that require immediate court intervention and critical services for children and families in crisis, and I want to thank Administrative Judge Jeanette Ruiz, and our Family Court judges and professional staff, for the dedication and ingenuity they have shown in meeting the justice needs of our families and children during this challenging time,” said DiFiore.

DiFiore confirmed that all candidates who successfully completed an application for New York’s September bar exam will be able to sit for it, provided that they follow up with timely proof of eligibility and that new public health concerns don’t preclude them from moving forward as planned.
“The task of securing appropriate and sufficient space to administer a two-day exam to upwards of 5,000 candidates, in multiple locations across the state, in the midst of a public health crisis, has been very challenging, to say the least,” said DiFiore. “And so, I want to thank and commend my Court of Appeals colleague, Michael Garcia, who led the working group that, together with the Board of Law Examiners, did an excellent job of making smart and responsible recommendations that balanced the complex logistics and public health concerns and put us in a good position, as of now, to safely administer the September bar exam.

Something feels broken that will take longer than a transition of power to fix.
We followed the American dream as the early settlers had done (without visas), expecting the natives to make room for them. We worked to become part of the fabric that binds, only to see the rips in it and feel the welcome mat pulled out. Even the ultimate prize of US citizenship is being whittled down by a president who rules by dividing.
Donald Trump came into office touting a border wall, and leaves yelling specious claims of voter fraud, still pointing the finger at minorities. In between he separated children from their parents at the border and caged them, banned people from Muslim countries and froze permanent residence visas. He's on his way out, but the intolerance and hatred unleashed in ordinary Americans will take longer to put back in the box. It targets Black Americans who had the audacity to protest police brutality. Trump accused them of ""treason"" and threw federal troops in their path. His message reached all the way to an Iowa high school baseball game where spectators yelled Trump's name while chanting that a Black player on the opposing team should have been a slave, or killed by police.
Hate crimes in the United States rose last year to their highest level in more than a decade. Between 2017 and 2019, the number of white nationalist groups more than doubled.
Last month, my great-nephew Elijah in Southern California turned 12 and aced most of his classes. His dad, Ishan, is my sister Amrita's son. Elijah's mother is half Jamaican and half African American. Ishan, who looks white, took him to some civil rights rallies this summer and felt it was time to give him ""the talk."" ""People might judge you because of your skin,"" he said. ""Police might judge you. Stay calm. Don't give them a reason to use violence.""
I hated that he had to do that but regret not having known to do it with my own sons (who share my complexion) before they faced racial profiling as children.
The American promise lured Elijah's white, Jewish great-great-grandparents from Eastern Europe when pogroms were being waged against Jews in the early 20th century. Arriving penniless in New York, they worked hard and prospered. Paul Kesselman, Elijah's great-grandpa, got an education, became an accountant and opened his own firm. He married a high school biology teacher whose parents had immigrated from Lithuania, and they settled into a middle-class life in the New York suburb of Peekskill. Their son Mark, my brother-in-law, made an illustrious career as a political science professor at Columbia University, marrying Amrita, a professor at Amherst College.
His father's satisfaction with America was only tempered, Mark told me, by the economic and racial inequalities and anti-Semitism they saw here. The latter has also trended upwards in recent years. The FBI reported 953 anti-Semitic hate crimes in 2019, up 14% from the previous year.
I think about parallels with Ebrahim and Shamim Jesani's journey to Atlanta. They're the parents of Sofia, the girlfriend of my younger son, Romen. The family, Indian Muslims, migrated to America from Mumbai in 1985 as newlyweds in search of better prospects than their parents had. New York, with its high crime rate, menial job offerings and struggles to communicate, was a tough adjustment. But they took what they got, later moving to Atlanta, where they had friends. Ebrahim worked as a cashier and, as Mark's father had done, studied accounting and opened up his own firm; 23 years later, it's still thriving.
But the last four years have marred the Jesanis' sense of well-being, inserting apprehension and fear into the mix. From the Muslim ban to the constant scapegoating rhetoric, they've felt the sting of religious intolerance, as the Kesselmans found toward Judaism a century earlier. The currents have pulled Sofia away from her advertising career path to social justice work and political campaigns, starting with organizing a forum on police brutality in 2016. Most recently she worked for Joe Biden's presidential campaign. Born here into US citizenship and grounded in US cultural trends, Sofia surprised me the other day by saying of her relationship to America, ""I still have impostor syndrome like most minorities tend to have here."" Much as I hate hearing it, I've been there myself.
My diverse extended family's experiences share much in common with those of other minorities and immigrants struggling to fully belong, especially now. So it fills me with pride to see them standing up for other groups. My own journey here from India was always meant to be temporary. My Indian parents were professionals at the United Nations in New York, where they intended to stay until the mandatory retirement age of 60. Then it was back to my mother's family home in New Delhi. But by the time they left, as I had planned to do with them, I had inconveniently fallen in love with an American of Italian origin.
Four hundred and twelve years after Columbus ""sailed the ocean blue,"" Guiseppe Borsellino and his two brothers departed Italy to seek their own American fortunes, leaving their parents and two sisters behind. Interestingly, the side that flourished most was the one that stayed in Sicily: 11 members became doctors and they live with great sophistication in beautiful homes.
In New York, meanwhile, Guiseppe had a son and a grandson they called Bobby. And while most on the US end made it out of the Bronx and into the suburbs, he grew up in public housing, raised by a single mother who worked as a seamstress in a garment factory after his father's early death.
Rob, as he was later known, put himself through college, became a journalist and by his late 20s, had hopscotched up the ranks of his first newspaper to become its editor — in time to hire me for my first reporting job.
I don't think the Borsellinos ever envisioned an Indian wife as part of their American dream. One uncle wondered aloud if we'd have zebras for kids. But dreams can shift with passing generations. 
Hope is my overriding emotion these days: for a vaccine, new leadership and in the generation behind mine, with its broader view and commitment to bringing everyone along. Hope that America will be dynamic enough to tap the best in each of them, and to claim all of us.

It’s Tuesday. 
Weather: Dangerously hot: A high in the mid-90s will seem closer to 100. Afternoon thunderstorms could bring strong gusts. 
Alternate-side parking: Suspended through Sunday. 
Nearly every week since “Black Lives Matter” was painted in front of Trump Tower in Manhattan, someone has unloaded a bucket of paint on the giant yellow letters.
In one incident, two women shouted “All Lives Matter” as they ran across the three words while pouring paint on them. Another time, a woman yelled, “Bill de Blasio doesn’t care about Black people!” as she smeared the street art with paint while on her hands and knees.
As of Monday night, the words had been defaced by paint at least five times. Most of the paint throwers were swiftly arrested, the police said, and city workers repainted the letters.
The defacing has come as many New Yorkers continue to protest against systemic racism and police brutality in the wake of the killing of George Floyd on May 25 in Minneapolis.
The details
The first incident happened just four days after the painting’s unveiling on July 9, the police said. A man walked to the street — the block of Fifth Avenue between 56th and 57th Streets — with a paper bag, took out a bucket of red paint and poured it mainly over the word “Lives.” Workers from the City Department of Transportation quickly cleaned and repainted the letters. No arrest has been made.
Four days later, the police said, two women and one man arrived with blue paint; a video showed one of the vandals wearing a shirt that read “All Lives Matter.”
The next day, a Times reporter saw a group of women throwing black paint on the words as they screamed phrases including “Refund the police” and “Jesus matters.”
The two most recent incidents occurred on Saturday and Sunday, when a man from Rochester cast paint over the street art, the police said.
The context
The street project has been seen as the latest dispute in a feud between Mayor Bill de Blasio and President Trump. The two have repeatedly clashed over New York prosecutors seeking the president’s financial records and the mayor’s presidential primary bid.
In one case last year, the president called Mr. de Blasio “the worst mayor in the United States.” A few months later, Mr. de Blasio told BuzzFeed that Mr. Trump would “not be welcome back in New York City” when he left the White House.
“The president is a disgrace to the values we cherish in New York City,” a spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio said in June. “Any time he wants to set foot in the place he claims is his hometown, he should be reminded Black Lives Matter.”
In response, the president — who has repeatedly disparaged protesters — wrote on Twitter that the project was a “symbol of hate.”
The precedent
Fifth Avenue isn’t the only city street painted with “Black Lives Matter.” The words have been placed at Foley Square in Lower Manhattan and on Fulton Street in Brooklyn, among other locations.
Across the country, other cities have embraced similar paintings. In Washington, Mayor Muriel Bowser had “Black Lives Matter” painted on a street leading to the White House in early June.
In Portland, Ore., and Cincinnati, the street art has also been vandalized. And this month in Martinez, Calif., two people were accused of defacing “Black Lives Matter” signage and charged with a hate crime.

And finally: A virtual field trip to Mars
NASA is about to send a 2,200-pound rover to Mars. The mission — the last of three spacecraft being launched to the red planet this summer — will help bring scientists closer to answering the longstanding questions about life on other planets and whether Mars could be a base camp for further exploration.
New Yorkers, stuck in their homes millions and millions of miles away, can follow along through MarsFest, a series of free online events being offered on Wednesday by the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan. (The museum is closed because of the coronavirus crisis.)
“We want to inspire wonder in this time when everything feels overwhelming and people feel shut in,” said Bella Desai, the director of the museum’s public programs. “Science pushes us forward, and there will be even more opportunities for exploration and discovery and hope on the other side of this pandemic.”
The rover, Perseverance, is expected to land on Mars in February and collect samples from the planet’s surface. A helicopter named Ingenuity is also part of the mission; NASA will be making its first attempt to fly a helicopter on another planet.
During MarsFest, a Facebook event at 10 a.m. will introduce Mars to children. At 1 p.m., scientists will lead a virtual field trip to the planet via YouTube. And at 8 p.m., a livestreamed “Space Comedy Jam” will feature stand-up acts, music performances and space-related games. Get more details about the day and register for the livestream comedy show on the museum’s website.
“What better way to escape quarantine than to take a virtual field trip to Mars?” Ms. Desai said.

Metropolitan Diary: Her rocker 
Dear Diary:
I drove to the Upper West Side on a sunny day last fall to deliver a rocking chair to a young friend who was in her last month of pregnancy. The chair was one my mother had given me decades ago when I was pregnant with my first child.
Because a rocking chair is awkward to carry, I hoped I would find a parking space near my friend’s building. Alas, no luck. The closest space I could find was on Riverside Drive near Grant’s Tomb about a dozen blocks from her apartment.
After some experimentation, I decided that the best way to carry the chair was to hold it by the arms, upside down, with the seat above my head and the rockers up in the air.
I felt a bit conspicuous as I headed off down the sidewalk along Riverside Park. The park was full of people, and I was a gray-haired woman carrying a rocking chair upside down over her head. I was sure I would get some strange looks, and maybe a comment or two.
I needn’t have worried. No one batted an eye.

I'm Dana Perino, along with Juan Williams, Greg Gutfeld, Jesse Watters, and Dagen McDowell. It is 5:00 in New York City, and this is THE FIVE. More chaos and unrest in major American cities, in Washington, D.C., the American flag going up in flames and protesters threatening to tear down the Lincoln Emancipation Memorial.
The National Guard now being called into protect statues in the nation's capital. Men with long guns gathered in Atlanta outside the Wendy's where Rayshard Brooks was killed, with some are saying cops are not allowed. And over in Wisconsin, things took a violent turn at the state capital, crowds toppling two statues, including one of colonel who fought on the Union's side in the Civil war.
A Democratic state senator also attacked. President Trump promising to stop the vandalism with an executive order, take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: I think many of the people that are knocking down these statues don't even have any idea what the statue is, what it means, who it is. They're looking at George Washington. They're looking at Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, not going to happen. Not going to happen, not as long as I'm here.
As far as Democrats are concerned, I think they could care less whether or not it happens. And I think the American people get it. So we're going to have a very strong executive order. And it will happen very quickly, before the end of the week.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: Jesse, the National Guard has been called in Washington, D.C. They'll be there. They will be unarmed. I'm not so sure that's the best idea, given that some of these have turned quite violent, as the state senator in Wisconsin found out. But at some point, in addition to an executive order, you have to have some order, and how are we going to get that, as this continues every single night.
JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Well, the mayors have to step up. But they won't, so the feds have to back them up. The Democrats really aligned themselves with a great movement, heck of a job, guys. Started off OK and then you have a bunch of looters, arsonists, homicidal maniacs, people that want to tear down Lincoln. I mean, for a second, maybe I guess the Republicans are on their heels.
Not anymore. I mean, you run against this in the fall? It's a lay-up. Kneeling for the anthem? Taking down Jefferson? Burning things, assaulting gay progressive politicians in swing states? No, no, no, no, no, the Democrats had a moment of unity and they destroyed it. If you listened to Tim Scott today on the Senate floor, he said listen.
The Democrats had 80 percent of what they wanted in this police reform bill. And instead of taking that and then trying to win back in November and then finishing up the last 20 percent, they tossed it all out because they just want to campaign on the issue. They don't want to solve the issue. So now, they have zero percent. And you think the Democrats take power, they're going to pass police reform now.
They are not even going to try. This was a part of time when you had everybody almost in agreement and they threw it away. If the Democrats had backed a movement that was non-violent and had done civil disobedience, maybe that would've persuaded some people. But I know a lot of people right now. They're looking around. They're not talking to pollsters.
They're not posting on social media. They're not going to say it. You think they're voting for Joe Biden after they see what's going on? They are absolutely not voting for Joe Biden when they see this. And if you look at the people tearing down the statues and assaulting police officers and burning things, do they even look like people that vote?
They don't look like the most civic-minded, responsible people, if you know what I mean. So I'd be careful if I tried to ride this wave to November.
PERINO: So I want to -- I do want to ask about the police reform bill because, Juan, there was this -- about for two weeks, bipartisan agreement, police reform is need and necessary. The House put forward a bill. The Senate put forward a bill. Senator Tim Scoot took direct language from Kamala Harris' bill, Cory Booker's bill, Gary Peters' bill, put it all into his.
And still they declined to allow it to go to vote. But then you had House Speaker Nancy Pelosi say this about the Republicans.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
NANCY PELOSI, HOUSE SPEAKER: For something to happen, they're going to have to face the reality of police brutality, the reality of the need for justice and policing, and the recognition that there are many, many good people in law enforcement, but not all. But so far, they were trying to get away with murder actually, the murder of George Floyd.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: How can anyone with a good conscience say that? But also, if you're the Speaker of the House, aren't you supposed to want to try to get legislation passed?
JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Yeah. I think she does want to try to get legislation passed. She doesn't want weak legislation that really would not take advantage of this moment where so many people are outraged by what happened with George Floyd. Ahmaud Arbery, you saw today some police officers were charged in that case, so I just -- I mean to me, there's --
(CROSSTALK)
PERINO: Not the police officers --
(CROSSTALK)
PERINO: -- the people that got indicted in Georgia --
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: Right.
PERINO: Yes. They were not on-duty officers. But what about the fact that Nancy Pelosi said that there were Republicans who universally agreed that what happened to George Floyd was a murder, was outrageous, and they wanted to do police reform. And she says that because -- she thinks it's a weak bill, that the murder of George Floyd is now on the Republicans?
WILLIAMS: No. She's saying that they are trying to move away from the power of this moment with a weak bill, Dana. And I think that she has a very good point. They didn't even ban this choke business. So to me, you want something that has significance that speaks to the power of the moment. To me, like, you know, when you pick -- cherry pick some of these instances of violence.
And violence is always bad. You have to keep in mind that it's not representative of the power of this moment. I mean, it reminds me, you know, of people here in Washington, D.C. Senators who said they did not want to have a march on Washington -- 63. They feared there would be violence where George Wallace who said I don't want a march across the Pettis Bridge because it will tie up traffic.
Those people are missing the power of this moment, which is black and white Americans coming together to address racism in this country.
PERINO: All right. But is it eclipsing the moment when you have situations like this, Greg? Take a look at what happened to Andrea Mitchell over at MSNBC and Eleanor Holmes Norton in Washington yesterday. What do you think, Greg?
GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Wow. I loved the hair. I have to say, Dana. I didn't know you were so fast. Look, Andrea Mitchell shows two sides of the media, right, the fake and the real. And so the fake side is there is an epidemic of police violence. That's the fake. The real -- help, I need the police. So you -- it is a perfect comparison.
The fake is, oh, liberals are the party of compassion. The real, they're destroying our country inside out. Private property, public property, people, they're beating them up. But we have this false belief. The fake, this is Trump's America. No, this is what happens when you let the insane take over the asylum. What kills is me is that ii -- the left no doubt commits an overwhelming bulk of violence.
Yet, their ideology gets a total pass historically. And even today, by the media, academia, entertainment, no one is talking about this stuff. They are too busy pointing at the Trump rally, at those thugs, who basically just wave flags, where these people burn flags. And I am sorry. I'm so -- I kind of over this like -- but you know, protesting is such an important part of America.
We get that. You need a new line, because this isn't protesting. Every day that you apologize for this stuff, Juan, you let the country suffer. And Democrats, you've got to understand. Liberals, you have to understand. This isn't the same left that you are used to. This is a different kind of left wing. The left before actually allowed for dialogue, conversations, debate.
The modern left now, they're not interested in opening your mind unless it's with a crowbar. And you're being false to your party and false to the people that are your friends by denying that this isn't a bad scene, a destructive scene, and something that's going to destroy this country. You've got to stop apologizing for this crap.
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: I'm not apologizing, by the way. That's not what I'm saying at all. But I know we need to move on. But just let me just say. That's not what I'm saying. It's a total distortion of what I'm trying to say here.
PERINO: All right. I do want to get Dagen in. Because, Dagen, all of this is happening while the country is trying to reopen, while you still have millions of -- tens of millions of people unemployed. Food bank lines are overwhelmed. And we are not focusing on trying to deal with that problem, because if you have violence, that is what it's going to be the headline of the day.
DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Violence made worse by feckless governors and particularly mayors of left-wing cities. I call it the left wing looniverse. Nancy Pelosi and her ilk in Washington are trying to blame President Trump for all of this and give cover and make excuses for all these people running these cities who are showing wilful blindness to murder and mayhem in lower income neighborhoods and minority neighborhoods.
They govern like they have a deep, abiding hatred of the people and their cities. It is disgusting. And it is going to give rise to vigilante justice, people taking up arms illegally and organize crime. Because you know what, small shop owners and individual citizens, they don't have -- they are not rich. They don't have security with them like Andrea Mitchell.
They have to fend for themselves. And they're going to wind up paying gangsters to protect them, because governors and mayors won't and don't.
PERINO: All right, good talk everybody. Coming up, a big legal win for Michael Flynn, I love how that rhymes, more on that next.
WILLIAMS: A major legal development for Michael Flynn, a federal appeals court ordering a judge to drop the criminal case against President Trump's former national security advisor. Here's reaction from President Trump.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: What happened to General Flynn should never happen again in our country. He was persecuted. And many other people were persecuted. The Obama administration spied in the campaign. This is just the first one. He's been exonerated. And I want to congratulate him. He's been through a lot. He's been through a lot. He had great courage, great fortitude.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAMS: Dagen, let me start with you. This is a very curious case to my mind. As I understand it, Mr. Flynn pleaded guilty for lying to the FBI. The president when he fired him said that Mr. Flynn had lied. But now, the president says Michael Flynn was persecuted. What do you make of this?
MCDOWELL: Yeah. Nobody lies when they are basically when the feds are trying to bankrupt them and destroy their family. Nobody would ever be coerced into a confession, right? The problem is there was not enough evidence to ever prove this in a court of law. You know who didn't think that Michael Flynn was lying, the two FBI agents who originally questioned him.
That's worth nothing. They also never advised him of his rights. A confession in a court of law would not have been admissible. My advice is if the feds ever come calling, I said this when Martha Stewart was on trial, don't you talk to them. Don't even belch in their presence.
WILLIAMS: Dana, today, you had an assistant prosecutor, actually one of the chief prosecutors in the Roger Stone case say that he was pressured by the Trump administration to go easy on Roger Stone. Over the weekend, we saw the U.S. attorney for the southern district of Manhattan who was investigating Trump associates fired.
And now this Flynn case. Is there a pattern of the Justice Department going easy on the president's friends and associates?
PERINO: Yeah. I think the Democrats are trying to establish a pattern, but each of those things that you talked about are separate. On Michael Flynn, I would say that his decision to fire his original lawyers and replace them with Sidney Powell of Texas is probably going to go down as one of the best moves that a defendant has ever made.
The original lawyers charged him $6.7 million. And now, you have this lawyer from Texas, she is a boss lady, comes in and she figures it out. And I think that it will be interesting to see how this all turns out. Because you still have two investigations into the origins of this, which doesn't have anything to do with what the whistleblower said today.
It's something separate. But I anxiously await that -- the conclusion of that investigation, because I think we need to hear that well before the election.
WILLIAMS: Yeah. So Jesse, we had a transcript released by the Trump administration in late May. And it showed Flynn talking with the Russian ambassador about sanctions on Russia. And of course, he denied that he had those conversations. So I'm -- again, it's just curious to me, isn't that evidence that he lied?
WATTERS: Nope, he never said that. He just said he couldn't remember if he talked about him or not. And if you look at the transcript, Juan, he actually never says the word sanctions. He just says reciprocal response, so nice try. It was a very interesting question that you asked about whether the Justice Department has taken it easy on Trump associates.
Where have you been, Juan, for the last three years? They've all been charged with a crime. I don't know where that came from. And by the way, if my children were threatened to be locked up if I didn't cop a plea, I'd copped the plea. You have sons. If they threaten to lock up your sons, you'd copped a plea. It's not a crime to change your plea.
Everybody knows it. But if you had a real reporter in this country, maybe next time they see Joe Biden. Because I'd be asking Joe Biden, hey, Joe, why did you bring up the Logan Act and then said you had no idea about the Flynn case? Or maybe ask Barack Obama, what did you mean when you told Comey that you wanted the right people to investigate Mike Flynn? Simple question, what did he mean?
WILLIAMS: OK.
WATTERS: Oh, wait.
WILLIAMS: So Greg, this wasn't the media. This wasn't the Democrats. This was President Trump saying that Mike Flynn is exonerated. Do you think that's right?
GUTFELD: Yeah, absolutely right. First of all, if they ever threatened to imprison my children, I would never have copped a plea because I hate children. This was a prolonged injustice. This was a prolonged injustice directed at a patriot who is simply trying to get ahead and do his job. I mean, get ahead on his new job and serve his country.
But he got singled out simply because the skittish little bureaucrats couldn't stand the new boss, and so they took it out on him. And the media were on to it like junkies. They -- vilification became their drug, and that blinded them from seeing exactly what was being done to an innocent man. There you go. That's my summary.
WILLIAMS: All right. All right, ahead, don't miss Greg's monologue on the media's coverage of the Bubba Wallace story. That's all for you next on THE FIVE.
GUTFELD: It's a story the media loves. What could be better than a noose to encourage a riot? But the rest of us knew.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This disgusting display of hatred that happened overnight, a noose was found hanging in Bubba Wallace's garage.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A disturbing and sadly telling discovery overnight.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A noose was found hanging in the garage of Bubba Wallace.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A noose was found.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: An ugly message of hate was placed in his garage.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it's incredibly upsetting and discouraging that this noose was found.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: So this prompted much support from NASCAR for Bubba, which was very nice. But then the real news came out. The noose was a garage door pull that had been around well before Bubba never arrived. So it's a misunderstanding. It wasn't Bubba's fault. He was told about it. So time to move on, media, except some can't, not when they've sunk so much effort into this, right, Al?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's clear what a noose represents, and then did someone know that it was in the stall when they did belatedly assign Bubba there. I do not think that we've seen closure in this particular inquiry.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: So how does Al still get a pass on this stuff? It's as if all the anchors who interview him wilfully forget Tawana Brawley. So even after FBI's 15 agents concluded Wallace wasn't a hate crime victim, the media still can't let it go. So what should end up as a tense mix up becomes media-driven race bait. As the story fades, the media tried to give it CPR to give the descent alive, which means egging the athlete on.
It's not fair to Bubba. The good news, a racist act turns out once again not be racist at all. The bad news, the race-baiters don't care. Because for the media, evidence of racism is a good thing, even if it's not real, it's their way of weaselling out of their role in unleashing the lie. People who said it was a garage door pull were called conspiratorial.
Yeah, people who saw the obvious explanation for a rope tied to a garage door, they were the whack jobs, versus those who saw it as a racist lie (ph). Turns out that half of the suburban homes in America are guilty of systemic racism. This, just days after nooses is discovered in a park turned out to be exercise rings installed by a black man. Again, it's the contrast.
The left commits genuine acts of deadly violence and it's called protest. Meanwhile, nonexistent crime is blamed on a law-abiding public. So who is hoping for hate? Look for the people with the press passes. All right, I want to read the statement from Bubba Wallace. It's actually a really good one, if they put it up on the prompter.
It's been an emotional a few days. First off, I want to say how relieved I am that the investigation revealed that this wasn't what we feared it was. I want to thank my team, NASCAR, and the FBI for acting swiftly and treating this as a real threat. I think we will gladly take a little embarrassment over what the alternatives could have been.
Make no mistake. Though some will try, this should not detract from the show of unity we had on Monday and the progress we've made as a sport to be a more welcoming environment for all. All right, Dana, you are the public relations maven. That was a great statement, I thought. Because he was able to admit that it's better off not having a hate crime and looking silly.
However, why did he have to go on Don Lemon and all these other shows and come off -- like, this would've been perfect, the best response.
PERINO: Well, I would -- I am not able to really put myself in his shoes because I have not lived his life. And I think when the news first broke that this was a possibility, it's important for the media to remember to use this really great adjective called alleged. It's like journalism class day one and then, every day after that.
But, you know, it moved quickly. And look, it wasn't without -- it wasn't outside the realm of possibility that it could have happened. And I think what Bubba Wallace was trying to say in that second statement is that look how swiftly everybody moved, because everyone was mortified that this might've happened, horrified that this would've happened. So for all of those that are out there protesting the racism in our police forces, and how we do policing, look at how quickly everyone came together. 15 FBI agents within a day handled it. And so there has been progress.
It doesn't mean that there doesn't need to be more reform we can -- we can and should do more reform. But I think that that is something that he was trying to say. And he's a young man, and he is thrust into a position of leadership. And I encouraged him to keep going.
GUTFELD: Dagen, you're a NASCAR expert, what the hell happened? Like where did it -- was it NASCAR that reported this or -- like, I'm still confused how this all happened.
MCDOWELL: My understanding is it was some people on Bubba Wallace's team who reported it to NASCAR. But I lay the blame on NASCAR right here. Because what they did, they released this statement, there is a hate crime investigation or news was found, no photo. If anybody had seen a photo, they would have known what it was. It's a garage door pull fashioned in the shape of a noose.
What NASCAR did was they -- the management set a fire in order to then put out the fire. Because this -- hate crime investigation, it dovetails really nicely with their recent P.R. push, doesn't it? And I could tell you, I know a lot of people who work in this sport. When they heard this, when they saw the statement, they immediately knew it was a misunderstanding.
They knew exactly what was going on. But see the people like the rest of this country who worked in NASCAR, they better shut up. They're not allowed to speak up because they will be called a racist and then they will be -- then they will be fired. And they're barely hanging on to their jobs as it is because most of them have gotten dramatic pay cuts. So shame on NASCAR, the management.
GUTFELD: Juan, what do you -- what do you make of this whole situation?
WILLIAMS: Well, I guess I have a question. It seems to me that media was right to report on an FBI investigation into an explosive incident potentially could have blown up. And it comes in a moment when NASCAR was banning the use of the Confederate flag, which made it all the more topical, it seems to me.
I mean, you think about the noose and the power of that symbol, it's not that Bubble Wallace put it -- put it there. Not at all. And he didn't even find it. But the noose represents -- is a symbol of hate and lynching in this country. That's a pretty powerful symbol. You can understand why people would want to talk about it and find out what was going on.
And, you know, I think NASCAR is to be saluted because they have taken a lot of grief over banning that confederate flag symbol, people flying airplanes with it over the raceway and the like. And I just think they are taking a stand and we all should be congratulating NASCAR.
GUTFELD: You know, Jesse, I think everybody I knew, knew how this was going to turn out. But nobody could say -- it's just like what happened in the playground, it happened with Jussie Smollett, everybody who is sensible and has a common sense and a good B.S. detector knew that what this was, but you're not allowed to say it. You can't say it.
WATTERS: No, you can't. It's better just to wait 48 hours and then usually the truth comes out. I don't know if it was a misunderstanding or something worse. We still don't even really know if it was a noose or not. The FBI says they're still trying to determine if it was an actual noose or if it was just a rope with the circle at the end that they use to pull the garage down.
It wasn't so much, Juan, that the media covered it, it was the way they covered it. To Dana's point, they were just saying, yes, there was a noose found and it was targeting this black driver. If you can just say a claim was made that alleged noose was found. I mean, that's the way you got to couch it. So it was couched irresponsibly.
I do understand why NASCAR kicked it up to the FBI, though, because they don't want to be in charge of saying no, it was just a misunderstanding and dismissing it. They want to make sure an official law enforcement agency locks this down definitively, and that's what they did.
GUTFELD: Yes. So it was basically a handle to pull down the garage door, otherwise known as fake news. Ahead, a battle of the presidents with Trump and Obama going after each other. That's next.
WATTERS: Former President Barack Obama is helping his buddy Sleepy Joe campaign from his basement and is going after Donald Trump.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We can't be complacent or smug or sense that somehow, it's so obvious that this president hasn't done a good job because look, he won once. And in one life, we didn't have a good clue as to how he was going to operate the last time. And obviously, we have more evidence that it's not working out real good.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: President Trump returning the favor mocking the both of them.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Today he's with Obama, President Obama. It only took them how long, a year and a half to endorse him. Even after he won, he didn't endorse him for a long time. And he's fighting -- he's fighting for Sleepy Joe. You know, he really feels strongly about it, so strongly that he was fighting. He wanted everybody to win, but Joe.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: All right, Dana, this is going to be fun to watch for the next couple of months.
PERINO: Yes. I have a feeling that if they're going to do more of these virtual fundraisers, they both might want to take a shot of espresso right beforehand just to pump it up a little bit. I was also so confused about the empty bookshelves behind President Obama. Greg, you might want to send him some of your new book, The Plus. He might really enjoy that.
GUTFELD: The Plus.
PERINO: I've always believed -- I've always believed that President Trump really wanted to run against Barack Obama and vice versa. These are two people that would have loved to have gone against each other in the campaign. But President Trump got the -- when you're dealt the cards, he got Hillary Clinton as his candidate, and that certainly helped propel him to a win.
But look, Obama and Biden, they raised $11 million last night. Obama will be a net plus for Biden on the campaign trail, no doubt.
WATTERS: No doubt about that. Greg, what do you think of Barack Obama's black on black gear? I liked it. He looks like you.
GUTFELD: I like -- what I like about him is he looks like he's from the future. Like, hello, America, I come to you with a very serious message from the future. You must elect this very old man to my left who can barely speak. Look, this is the plan. The interesting thing about this whole stuff, there were no specifics about Donald Trump's achievements because they're almost entirely positive.
So they operate in these generalities like, he's just not doing a good job. He's a bad guy. He's obnoxious. He brings terrible care -- he's a terrible character in the White House. They don't have the specifics. But they can't let Joe go up against Trump because it's like Bambi versus Godzilla, which is a great movie.
So he picked Obama versus Trump, because Obama's more relaxed and actually coherent, unlike Joe, which makes me think that there aren't going to be any debates, because I don't think Joe should be debating Trump. I think he should continue huddling in his closet with a case of ensure and you know, an old stack of National Geographics. Because I think the moment he gets on stage or anywhere near Trump, it's just going to be -- it's going to be an ugly, ugly scene.
WATTERS: OK, Dagen, follow that one up.
MCDOWELL: Vice President Joe Biden is clearly serious about wanting the presidency because he's got almost 20 years on President Obama. And among Biden, Obama, and President Trump, Joe Biden's face certainly is more taut than the other two. So his work says that he's very serious. And I speak from personal experience so I can say that.
WATTERS: All right, Juan.
WILLIAMS: You know, to me, I think that you know, you look at what President Obama is doing. I think he's saying to the Democratic base, don't be complacent. I don't think there's any mystery there. And the reason is as the New York Times poll out today has Biden up by 14 points, that follows a Fox poll had Biden up by 12, the CNN poll plus 14. Trump even tried to sue or wants to sue over the CNN poll.
So I think that, you know, when you hear President Trump going after Obama, it's like -- does anybody remember what happened to Obama gate? It's just a big nothing. Or, you know, hearing people at his rally shout locker up like they want to bring back and run against Hillary Clinton.
These are old reruns. These are summer reruns, and I think America doesn't like it, and I think that's what you're seeing. He's not doing so well, and he doesn't know how to deal with it.
WATTERS: I'm not so sure, Juan. And if I was a Trump supporter and the New York Times called me to ask me how I was going to vote, I don't know. That might explain some of the polling. The mullet making a big come back. Find out why next.
MCDOWELL: Welcome back. Lockdown weary drivers are now forgetting the rules of the road. A survey finds people are making simple mistakes like forgetting to turn on the ignition or being confused about what to do with all those pedals. Jesse, you look like a terrible driver.
WATTERS: Why would you say that, Dagen? I'm an excellent driver, and I take offense to that. And now I'm not talking to you anymore.
MCDOWELL: You're not talking to me? OK, Dana, you can talk to me.
WATTERS: No. I'm offended and I'm not talking. Go ahead. Go ahead.
MCDOWELL: Dana?
PERINO: Well, when we moved to New York City, I stopped driving really because I was too afraid to drive in the city. But because of the pandemic, I actually drove in the city. Now, it was like driving in downtown New Castle, Wyoming because there was nobody on the roads, but I actually have improved my driving skills during Coronavirus.
MCDOWELL: Excellent. Greg?
GUTFELD: This was a study of U.K. drivers. So they already drive on the wrong side of the road. So, actually, this means that they're driving poorly, they're actually driving better.
MCDOWELL: Juan?
WILLIAMS: Well, yes, that's picking up on it. It is a British study, so their number one problem was stalling because people are getting back into manual cars and they're not shifting properly. That's not a problem for us Americans. We drive automatic cars. Our problem is more what Dana was saying, you know, the streets are empty and there are people who are speeding. Too many people decide oh, I can fly down the road now.
MCDOWELL: Yes, or ride a scooter. I saw somebody take a big spill on a scooter earlier today. Moving on, somebody better tell Billy Ray Cyrus the Mullet is back, like it or not. The business in the front, party in the back hairdo making a big return during the lockdown, or the sho-lo, Greg, as I like to call it. Short in the front long in the back.
GUTFELD: Well, I Don't believe this. The Mullet isn't coming back. What happened is because we've been using smartphones all the time, we're like this and it's forced our heads into a permanent tilt and it's forcing our scalp backwards. So it appears to be a mullet when it's just that our face has moved. The hair hasn't changed, but the face has moved.
MCDOWELL: Dana?
PERINO: I encourage all men to really go for this look. I find it extremely attractive. The mullet is amazing.
MCDOWELL: Juan?
GUTFELD: Yes.
WILLIAMS: If it makes you happy, go for it. I don't know.
MCDOWELL: My favorite mullet is actually Carol Brady's mullet. Jesse?
GUTFELD: Oh, she was hot.
WATTERS: Do you think I got a little -- what do you think? Do you see anything? Look at that. Look at it.
PERINO: Yes, you got one.
WATTERS: I got a little action back there. I got a little bit. Look at that. Look at that.
PERINO: You're also getting a little thin on the side.
WATTERS: Don't say that. Now, I'm mad at both of you women.
MCDOWELL: Jesse has like tennis pro hair, like the country club hair.
GUTFELD: He does. I was going to -- he's got game show host hair from the 70s.
PERINO: We only make fun of your hair because it looks so good.
MCDOWELL: Yes, exactly. And by the way, I can create --
WATTERS: Thank you, everybody.
MCDOWELL: I can create a mullet, by the way. See, it kind of looks like it, right?
WATTERS: Nice.
MCDOWELL: ""ONE MORE THING"" is up next.
PERINO: It's time now for ""ONE MORE THING."" I'll go first. So, you know how you've heard that yawning is contagious. I'm just not sure that anyone is going to want to yawn like this dog named Barney. Take a listen.
I love how his eyes roll back in his head. He's the best, Barney. Also, if you don't want to yawn, you got to check out the new podcast. I'll tell you what. We talk a lot about the statues, the history of them, get a good little lesson there about Lafayette, if you will. Jesse?
WATTERS: Jesse's Shark News. Let's see it. Wow. Is that the outfit I would wear riding a shark? Not so sure, but I like it.
GUTFELD: Jesse? Hey, Jesse.
WATTERS: Yes.
GUTFELD: Jesse?
WATTERS: Yes.
GUTFELD: Jesse, somebody should tell CNN that this is photoshopped before they do a fact check.
WATTERS: Yes. This is a digitally altered image, CNN. All right, so you guys want to see some jaw-dropping video? Watch this.
GUTFELD: What is he doing?
MCDOWELL: Abusing that animal?
GUTFELD: What is he doing?
WATTERS: Yes. Look at this guy. He caught a shark. It had a little hook in its mouth. He just showed everybody its sharp teeth, took the hook out, and let it swim away. Greg, I think you're right. I think shark attacks, they're not that dangerous. I think it's overhyped by the mainstream media. And if you see a shark, just go right up and grab it and show everybody its teeth.
PERINO: Yes. These are --
GUTFELD: I'm pretty --
PERINO: These are alleged shark attacks. Greg, you're next.
WATTERS: Right.
GUTFELD: I'm pretty open-minded. I'm pretty open-minded about all kinds of relationships. But what that man and that shark were doing in public was sickening. And there were children around, take that stuff inside. All right, let's do this.

GUTFELD: Yes, they are. They're great. Today, I woke up and I asked myself, you know what I really want to see, Greg. I want to see a baby rhinoceros getting a sponge bath. So I demanded it and I got it. Here it is. Check out this horny little devil getting a little spongy body clean with a little broom. Look at that. He's got his own little stand that he can like lean against while he gets clean. Look at that. Adorable, much better than a dog yawning, that's for sure. I mean, seriously, Dana, way to mail it in.
PERINO: I don't know. I thought that was pretty cute Barney. All right, Juan.
WILLIAMS: Oh baby, get ready for some high wire thrills from the Swiss Alps. Take a look at these Daredevil folks in a suit and bow tie performing on the edge of a mountain. That's Ramon Kathriner. He's a seventh- generation circus performer who has broken several world records. But there was no audience for this circus.
No, this glacier 3000 airshow was put on to show support for circus performers around the globe who are out of work because of the Coronavirus. But even the virus couldn't stop them, couldn't stop that stunt. The show must go on.
PERINO: And that is not digitally altered. Wow, that gave me --
WILLIAMS: No, no, no.
PERINO: All right, Dagen, your next.
MCDOWELL: Am I wrong to say that just doesn't look that hard?
GUTFELD: Yes, I agree. I agree.
MCDOWELL: I was like, what's the big --
GUTFELD: I agree.
MCDOWELL: You know, go to the -- you know, if they just open the -- like the parks and whatnot, we get that on in New York City. So more animals. Take a look at this. A mob -- well, a small collection of kangaroos just bounded down the street in Western Australia. John Caldwell, they live on a nearby golf course. Apparently, he -- a local sanitation worker film the group hopping through the streets. Apparently, they're twice as many kangaroos in Australia as people. It makes me want to move there.
GUTFELD: Make rules.
PERINO: Yes, that could -- that could in New York. We could try that.
All right, that's it for us. ""SPECIAL REPORT"" is up next. We will see you tomorrow. Bye-bye."

Interestingly enough, the NYPD hate crimes statistics summary at this point included only one report of a hate crime directed towards Asians at this point, so as you can imagine, the numbers weren't really adding up and I was shocked to hear the statistics, to be honest. 
Underreporting has always been an ongoing issue within our community, but I also felt like if we didn't bring public attention to this issue, our experiences would be confined to these online spaces, and never be taken seriously unless we did the documenting ourselves. So let's look at some of the documenting. I know you've got a whole series of case studies. If we take a couple - Justin, for example. Tell me his story. Yes, so Justin Tsui is a registered nurse who was harassed by a man on his way home on the subway, and the man made a reference to ""chinks spreading all these sicknesses,"" and told him to go back to his country. He continued to be aggressive towards him until Justin feared he would fall onto the tracks. What was particularly heartbreaking about Justin's story was that this is one of many incidents that he had experienced, you know, while commuting daily to the hospital where he worked as a nurse. So essentially he's, you know, being exposed to all of this harassment while he is in scrubs on public transportation, right? And ironically, Justin also had experienced more harassment than perhaps the rest of us because he had made the conscientious choice to wake up every morning during this pandemic and to protect his community out on the front lines as an essential worker. And I think with other cases, there are examples of different kinds of prejudice or discrimination kind of layering themselves on top of one another. Ida Chen, for example. Right, so Ida Chen's story actually resonated with me the most. She was catcalled by a man who said something to the effect of, ""I would be into you if you didn't carry the virus."" Racial insults directed at Asian women are"

New York's state legislature is considering a police reform agenda that would make police disciplinary records more transparent and restrict police from using chokeholds during arrests, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Friday. The 'Say Their Name' reform agenda would also make race-based false 911 calls a hate crime and demand the attorney general act as an independent prosecutor when police officers face murder charges. Cuomo will pass the agenda sometime next week, he said at a press briefing. This agenda follows a week of worldwide protests in response to George Floyd's death on May 25 in the custody of Minneapolis police. Floyd died after a white officer knelt on his neck for several minutes. Derek Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd's neck, has been charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter for the killing of Floyd. Three other officers present during Floyd's killing have been charged with aiding and abetting murder. 'Mr. Floyd is just the last name on a very long list,' Cuomo said at a press briefing. 'People are saying enough is enough.' Police officers' prior disciplinary records should be public knowledge, Cuomo said. Civil Rights Law 50-a currently protects the performance reviews of police officers, firefighters and corrections officers in New York state. Cuomo has said previously he would support a reform of 50-a, and protesters in Syracuse have echoed statewide calls for repealing or reforming the law in several protests this past week. 'Reform works for everyone's interest here,' Cuomo said.

A Brooklyn man who was sitting in his car on Tuesday afternoon was shot twice execution-style from close range by a gunman before collapsing and succumbing to his wounds, according to police.
Ricardo Pena, 37, of East Williamsburg was in his gold Kia sedan on Bushwick Avenue near Powers Street in Williamsburg when he was shot in the face by a gunman just before 2:40pm, the New York Daily News reported.
A wounded Pena then got out of his car before the gunman fired another shot, investigators told the Daily News.
Pena, who had blood pouring from his face and neck, collapsed just outside of a local laundromat.
Blood stains were seen on a white car nearby as it appeared Pena tried to support himself as he stumbled in the final moments of his life.
First responders rushed him to Woodhull Hospital, but he eventually died of his wounds.
'There were two shots,' Dan Moran, 33, an eyewitness, told the Daily News.
'One, and then another 10 seconds later.
'He was rolling around on the ground in front of that white car. His blood is on it.'
Moran added: 'He was bleeding from his face and neck. He was gasping pretty hard for air.
'Then the police came and put him on a stretcher, and were trying to revive him with an oxygen bag.'
Pena's younger brother, Chris Pena, told the Daily News: 'He was my brother. He was always a good big brother.'
'He wanted me to learn from his mistakes.'
Chris Pena told the Daily News that his brother had a record of previous arrests.
'He was kind and had a big heart,' he said.
'We don't know who would do this to him.'
So far, no arrests have been made. Police are pouring through surveillance video in hopes of getting clues that may lead them to a suspect.
Locals who knew Ricardo Pena say he installed windows and glass doors. 
Violent crime has been on the upswing in New York City since the COVID-19 pandemic as well as racial tensions, triggered by police-involved deaths of black people in other parts of the country, have upended normal life this past spring.
Over the weekend, two people were fatally shot and 12 others were wounded in several incidents that took place in The Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, and Manhattan. 
Five shootings involving seven people took place on Saturday while another seven were injured from gun shot wounds on Sunday. 
Tyrell Williams, 26, was shot dead in a street fight on Sunday morning and left a trail of blood before he collapsed near a Citi Bike Station around 1.20am in the East Village, reports said.
 Police told DailyMail.com that two groups of men were embroiled in a dispute on the corner of E. 13 St. and Avenue A.
One group approached the other, and New York Daily News reports that it soon became a physical altercation. An unidentified suspect then reportedly pulled out a gun and opened fire into the crowd of men. 
Williams took a bullet to the chest. He was transported to Mount Sinai Beth Israel, where he was pronounced dead, authorities said.
Christopher Pastor told NYDN that he was grabbing a bite to eat Sunday morning when he heard a loud noise. He ran over to the scene and spotted a big pool of blood outside of a restaurant on Avenue A.
'He had blood all over his mouth. His eyes were open, not breathing,' Pastor told the publication. 'You could tell that he was deceased.'
'EMS started to give CPR. They checked for pulse. He had no pulse,' he added.
Authorities roped off the crime scene, where Williams' white sneakers were still strewn across the street corner, NYDN reports. 
Hours earlier around 11pm on Saturday, another 26-year-old man was shot in the head in Hudson Heights, Upper Manhattan. He was found unresponsive on Post Ave. and was pronounced dead at St. Barnabas Hospital. 
The weapon was recovered at the scene and a 28-year-old man was taken into custody, the New York Post reports. 
The violence began with a Friday shooting in the Bronx on 174th Street and Ward Ave and spilled into the weekend.
A 36-year-old man was shot in the leg during a dispute at Movie Star Cuts barbershop on Merrick Boulevard in Jamaica, Queens on Sunday around 12.45am. However police said he would not cooperate.
Around the same time in Brooklyn, a 25-year-old man was shot in the nose.
Around 1.50am on Sunday a man was shot in the lower back on Union Street in Brooklyn but police say the victim was 'highly uncooperative.'
Sunday after 5am a 27-year-old man was shot in the neck and chest while driving around 149th Street and Southern Boulevard.
On Sunday morning around 5.30am in the Bronx, a 29-year-old man was hit in the stomach during an incident in the lobby of 1985 Webster Avenue.
Crime in New York City continued to climb, according to the NYPD CompStat.
As of October 4, there has been a 36.2 per cent increase in murders in 2020 than in 2019. There have been 346 murders this year, compared to 254 recorded last year. 
Shootings have also soared from 729 in 2019 to 1,442 shootings to date in 2020. 
Murders in New York City rose 79 percent last month compared to last year, and shooting incidents soared 127 percent, according to new NYPD crime statistics.
The citywide crime stats released on Friday show that New York's summer crime wave continued into September, as the city continues to grapple with a disturbing rise in violence.
Tensions in the city remain high after months of coronavirus lockdowns, economic misery and unrest in the streets, causing petty disputes to frequently escalate quickly into violence. As well, police say that gang violence has been a major factor in the rise in shootings.
There were 152 shooting incidents across the city in September, compared to just 67 such incidents in the same month last year, a 127 percent rise, the data shows. Over the first nine months of 2020, shootings were up 91 percent. 
Also last month, there were 51 murders in New York, compared to 29 in September of last year, an increase of 79 percent.
Through September 30, there were 344 murders in the city, compared to 246 murders in the first nine months of 2019, an increase of 40 percent.
Burglaries also rose an alarming 38 percent in September, and were up 42 percent for the year through September 30.
Overall, index crimes rose just 2 percent in September, with the rise in shootings and murders counter-balanced in part by declines in hate crimes (down 33 percent so far this year) and reported rapes (down 19 percent in September).
Police say that sex crimes continue to go under-reported, and urge victims to come forward by contacting the NYPD Special Victims Division. 
Anyone with information can call the NYPD's Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA (74782). "

Jussie Smollett raised a fist in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement at a protest outside of the Trump Tower in New York. 
The 38-year-old actor, who was accused of staging a fake attack on himself and claimed his assailants called him racial and homophobic slurs in Chicago in January 2019, participated in a large protest in Manhattan on Saturday. 
Wearing a baseball cap and an orange face mask, the star who appeared in the series Empire gathered with other demonstrators outside Trump Tower to fight against systemic racism and police brutality. 
The tower has been an epicenter for protests in the city where Mayor Bill de Blasio helped paint a Black Lives Matter mural on Fifth Avenue facing Trump's building. 
Smollett wore a blue T-shirt and jean shorts for the protest and was recognized by his distinctive equal sign tattoo on his right arm. It's not clear what group he was protesting with. 
On Saturday from day to night protests unfolded outside Trump Tower demanding Donald Trump be removed from office. 
By nightfall a large group held a banner outside the Fifth Avenue tower saying 'Trump/Pence #OutNow', demanding that they resign, while a flag was raised that stated 'Revolution Now!'
The president has come under heat for his handling of the coronavirus crisis and the Black Lives Matter movement. 
Smollett invoked national protests for Black Lives Matter and demonstrations denouncing George Floyd's death at the hands of Minneapolis police officers in his ongoing legal battle with the city of Chicago. 
The actor's fighting a $130,000 lawsuit from the city, where authorities accuse of him of lying and setting up the hoax attack. 
The first set of charges against him were dropped last year but after reviewing the case, a special prosecutor brought fresh charges against him in February 2020, indicting him on six counts pertaining to making four false police reports. 
The city of Chicago is trying to recoup the cost of the investigation into the Smollett 'hoax' totaling $130,105.15, and he's fighting back demanding to see files related to the firing of former Police Chief Eddie Johnson.
Johnson was fired after he was caught drinking and kissing his female security guard during a night out in December 2019.
Citing the police killing of George Floyd - he's demanding the city expose the police misconduct.
'As we see millions across the country rise up to protest and expose police misconduct, the City, by its refusal to produce the requested documents, is choosing to actively resist a citizen's lawful efforts to reveal dishonesty, directly relating to the charges against him, throughout the department, including the police superintendent who oversaw and publicly commented on the investigation of Mr. Smollett's report of a vicious hate crime and assault,' Smollett's attorneys wrote in a filing on June 6th. 
Earlier this month a federal magistrate judge said he would not order the city to share records related to Johnson's firing with Smollett's lawyers.
US Magistrate Judge Sunil Harjani said the records from Johnson's firing late last year are irrelevant to Smollett's civil case.
'This case is only about whether Smollett faked a hate crime against himself and wrongly induced the CPD to expend time, money and resources to investigate that allegedly false claim,' Harjani wrote. 
'Information related to Johnson's termination 11 months after Smollett's attack for conduct related to Johnson being found asleep in his car is not relevant to the city's claims.' 
Jussie Smollett returned to Los Angeles in April, after his lawsuit against the City of Chicago was tossed by a judge.
Since his return to L.A., Smollett has been seen catching up with his Empire co-star Taraji P. Henson and attending a Black Lives Matter protest.
His show Empire wrapped up its six-season run in April, though he was not a part of the final season, after being removed from the show due to the controversy surrounding his purported attack in Chicago. 
He was last publicly seen in Los Angeles with his family in early July. "

Abdullah, who was hailed by Baldwin as one of the original members of BLM, called Trump ""theembodiment of white supremacistterrorism"" and the ""terrorist-in-chief.""Baldwin onlyinformed viewers that Abdullah was just expressing her ""freedom of opinion.""For Baldwin, Abdullah's presence on her show was required because Trump[1] tweeted, ""Maybe our GREAT Police, who have been neutralized and scorned by a mayor who hates disrespects them, won't let this symbol of hate be affixed to New York's greatest street."" Abdullah responded to the tweet by declaring, ""I think it's the height ofhypocrisy for Donald Trumpcall anything a symbol of hate.He is the embodiment of hate,and for him to say thataffirming the value of blacklife is somehow hate, again,reminds us of who he is.""Despite having the whole tweet thread on briefly on screen, Baldwin refused to verbally add context to Trump's tweetswhich also included, ""This will further antagonize New York's Finest, who LOVE New York vividly remember the horrible BLM chant, 'Pigs In A Blanket, Fry 'Em Like Bacon.''Instead, she toed the CNN linethat the tweet was just further evidence of Trump ""stoking the racial divide in this country."" 
Other examples cited by Baldwin were the previously deleted clip of someone yelling ""white power"" and retweeting ABC's[2] video of theMcCloskey family.[3]Baldwin wondered, ""The election is still four months away, so if, and quite frankly when the president does this again, howshould the country respond?""Abdullah's response was to call Trump""theembodiment of white supremacistterrorism,"" blame him for a raise in hate crimes, and that ""we need as a country to be willingto point to him and say that heis actually the terrorist-in-chief."" Instead of pushing back on this incendiary rhetoric, all Baldwin could offer was, ""Wow.Those are strong, strong words.Obviously, the White House woulddispute that, but you're allowedyour freedom of opinion, and thefact is that the president ishighly critical of Black LivesMatter.""But the segment did not end there. Baldwin wondered if that Trump's resistance to pulling down monuments proves Black Lives Matter is necessary.Abdullah responded by highlighting the fact that beyond the slogan, BLM's professional activists can be quite radical, ""We recognize that the foundationof this country is really onethat has been grounded in racism.

Steven Vogel, 31, of Grinnell, was arrested Tuesday in the death of 44-year-old Michael Williams of Grinnell, the Iowa Department of Public Safety said. He's charged with first-degree murder and abuse of a corpse.
Police acknowledged that the killing of Williams, who is Black, had led to fears that he may have been targeted because of his race. Grinnell College even canceled classes Monday based on that fear. But police said Williams and Vogel, who is white, were well acquainted.
""The investigation has revealed no evidence to show the acts against Michael Williams were motivated by his race nor that his death was the result of a hate crime,"" police said in a release.
It wasn't immediately known whether Vogel had a lawyer who could comment on his behalf.
Betty Andrews, president of the Iowa-Nebraska NAACP, said during a news conference with police Tuesday that based on the evidence, she also believes there is no indication that Williams was targeted because of his race. However, she said she will evaluate additional evidence as it becomes available.
""Given that the current climate where racial justice is on the front burner for so many... we understand the fear this kind of incident evokes,"" Andrews said.
Investigators said that they believe Vogel strangled Williams on Sept. 12, but a possible motive wasn't released. Willliams' body was wrapped and bound and dumped in a ditch near Kellogg on Sept. 16, where it was set on fire, police said. His body was found ablaze after authorities were called that evening about the fire.
The others arrested, who also are white, are Julia Cox, 55, Roy Lee Garner, 57, and Cody Johnson, 29, all of Grinnell. They're each charged with abuse of a corpse, destruction of evidence and accessory after the fact.
Online court records for Cox and Garner didn't yet list lawyers for them on Wednesday morning. Cases hadn't yet been logged as of Wednesday morning in the online court system for Vogel and Johnson.

When Facebook profits off of hate, it is letting its platform be used to dehumanize and demean, said Attorney General Becerra. The spread of hate and disinformation on social media puts our democracy and decades of advocacy work by Black Americans, Latinos, the LGBTQ community, people with disabilities, and many others at risk. If Facebook truly wants to be a place that brings people together, it must do more Mark Zuckerberg must do more. We urge Facebook to take affirmative steps to join us in the fight to better tackle hate in our society and disinformation in our democracy. It will take all of us working together to make a difference.
Although Facebook has committed to the public and its users that it will invest billions of dollars each year to keep Facebooks community safe and continuously work with outside experts to review and update Facebooks policies, the recent independent civil rights audit of the companys policies and practices reveals that the steps taken thus far have fallen short. Private parties, organized groups, and public officials continue to use Facebook to spread misinformation and project messages of hate against different groups of Americans. According to recent surveys, more than forty percent of Americans have experienced some form of online harassment, including criminal forms of harassment like cyberstalking, doxing, and swatting. Of those Americans who report having been harassed online, more than three-quarters have reported being harassed on Facebook. Much of that harassment is focused on characteristics protected by the civil rights laws that state attorneys general are charged with enforcing, including race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender and gender identity, and disability. Unfortunately, recourse is unavailable for too many of these victims due to limitations on the services that Facebook offers victims.
In the letter, the Attorneys General urge Facebook to:
Aggressively enforce the companys policies against hate speech and organized hate organizations;
Allow public, third-party audits of hate content and enforcement;
Commit to an ongoing, independent analysis of the platforms content population scheme and the prompt development of best practices guidance;
Expand policies limiting inflammatory advertisements that vilify minority groups;
Offer live real-time assistance to help users address harassment before damage becomes irreversible;
Make information about unlawful harassment and intimidation more readily available, within the bounds of privacy laws, to victims and law enforcement; and

Protections in Italy Spurs Rallies on Both Sides",FALSE,"Supporters frame the measure as a long-overdue means to provide basic human rights. Opponents depict it as an overreaching step that would suppress opinion.
ROME — Protesters turned out in force on Saturday for rival demonstrations on a bill that would make anti-L.G.B.T. violence a hate crime carrying harsher penalties than under current law, coming out by the hundreds in Rome despite a resurgence of coronavirus cases in the country.
Demonstrations were planned throughout the country ahead of a parliamentary vote planned for this coming week, with supporters framing the measure as a long-overdue means to provide basic human rights and protection from attack, and opponents depicting it as an overreaching step that would also suppress opinion and religious beliefs.
“We have been through centuries of discrimination,” said Marlon Landolfo, 21, who recounted a vicious homophobic attack on him and another man in northern Italy last month. “Now it’s 2020 and we are still discussing a law that protects us for what we are.”
The bill under debate would explicitly recognize anti-L.G.B.T. and anti-women hate crimes and hate speech by including those offenses under an existing law that makes discrimination, violence or incitement to violence based on someone’s race or religion a crime punishable by up to four years in prison.
Current law does not have a specific designation for such offenses against L.G.B.T. people, and as a result, homophobic or transphobic assaults are tried on lesser charges than racially motivated or anti-Semitic ones.
The bill, which appears to have the support of a parliamentary majority, makes discrimination based on sex, gender, sexual orientation or gender identity an aggravating circumstance, which could mean added time to sentences.
Decades of efforts and multiple attempts to extend protections to L.G.B.T people have failed in Italy, making the country an outlier among Western European democracies such as Britain, France and Spain. Italy approved same-sex civil unions in 2016 but does not allow same-sex marriage.
Within the European Union, it is joined by Poland, the Czech Republic and Bulgaria in not responding to European Parliament appeals for member states to prosecute hate crimes and hate speech motivated by homophobia and transphobia.
Supporters of the bill face resistance from traditional opponents such as conservatives and the Roman Catholic Church, but also from some less expected corners, such as one group of feminists.
Proponents say a change would allow the authorities to keep statistics on homophobic and transphobic attacks, provide a deterrent and send a clear message that these are hate crimes.
Mr. Landolfo, his ankle still sore after a beating last month in the city of Padua, said he felt disheartened by the debate around the new bill. He and another young man, Mattias Fascina, had held hands and exchanged a quick kiss during a date on a September night when a gang mocked them, then punched and kicked them while shouting homophobic slurs. Under Italian law, the pair cannot be considered victims of a hate crime.
The attack on Mr. Landolfo is not an isolated case. Arcigay, Italy’s leading L.G.B.T. association, records more than 100 episodes of violence, hate and discrimination every year. In September, in the northern city of Novara, a man kicked his lesbian neighbor and broke her nose. In the city of Bergamo, residents of an apartment complex insulted and threatened two homosexual neighbors, prompting them to temporarily move out of their apartment.
“These episodes rarely turn into official complaints,” said Francesca Rupalti, a lawyer with Rete Lenford, a network of lawyers for L.G.B.T. rights. “Without a specific law, it is hard to prove homophobic acts.”
Alessandro Zan, a member of Parliament with the center-left Democratic Party who proposed the bill, said its ratification would denote a significant cultural shift in a society with deep patriarchal and conservative roots.
“These people are particularly exposed to hate crimes,” he said. “This is why we particularly need to protect them.”
Unlike the United States, where speech is largely protected by the First Amendment, Italy and many other European countries scarred by fascism and Nazism have stricter laws against preaching racial or ethnic superiority. They have also outlawed blatantly discriminatory associations or groups.
“Laws need to balance freedom of expression and hatred,” Mr. Zan said. “This law says clearly that discriminating against L.G.B.T. people and inciting violence against them is not an opinion.”
Some opponents of the bill say it will cross the line into censorship. They have presented hundreds of amendments — including one that mockingly asked to extend protection to bald or white-haired people — in order to slow down the legislative process.
One objection is that the bill, which opponents have dubbed a “gag law,” could be used to suppress dissenting opinions about same-sex marriage or adoption by homosexual couples. A prominent opponent, Matteo Salvini, the leader of the nationalist League party, said the bill “puts ideas on trial” and has insisted that Italy does not discriminate anyway.
Supporters say the bill would not infringe on free speech or religious liberty. Groups or individuals, they say, will still be able to promote and discuss their values as long as they do not engage in violent behavior or incite violence and hatred.
The nationalist and conservative political opposition has been joined by Italy’s Catholic bishops. That has unnerved advocates for the bill who had been encouraged by tolerant remarks from Pope Francis. The pope told a gay man in 2018 that God had made him that way, and in 2013 famously said “Who am I to judge?” when asked about a priest said to be gay — a dramatic change of tone in Vatican comments on homosexuality.
But the Italian bishops conference, which is influential in domestic politics, has argued that the measure could criminalize expression of the church’s belief that marriage should be between a woman and a man, if it were interpreted as incitement to discrimination.
The bishops said in a statement that Italian law already has tools available to punish violent and discriminatory behavior, and that adding more “incriminatory norms” would threaten liberty.
Some opponents from the left have also joined the fight against the proposed law. Although many leading feminist groups in the Western world have expressed support for L.G.B.T. protections, a group of well-known Italian feminists has criticized the pending bill for embracing a broader definition of women by using the term “gender identity,” which would include transgender women.
In an open letter published on a notable feminist website, the 13 signatories argued that the progress made against sexual discrimination against women in Italy would be undercut if the broader concept of gender identity is applied.
Francesca Izzo, a former member of Parliament with the Democratic Party who signed the letter, said that while it was important to fight homophobia and transphobia, it was a separate issue from the overall rights of women.
Proponents of the law reject that argument.
Mr. Zan, the lawmaker, said that feminists and L.G.B.T. people were fighting the same battle. “Violence against L.G.B.T. people is just another consequence of sexism,” he said. “Anatomy is not a person’s destiny.”

Long before those infused with hatred of Jews became active on the internet and social media, some would use the walls of synagogues and other Jewish communal institutions as canvases to express their vile antisemitism. Scrawling or painting Nazi swastikas, salutes to Hitler, and other antisemitic words was a simple way to attack Jews anonymously.
Temple Sinai and Temple Emanu-El were the latest victims, assaulted in the middle of the night July 15 with painted swastikas and messages of hate.
When members of our community awoke to news of the dual attacks, and some delivered their young children to Temple Sinai, where the graffiti was still visible, it naturally prompted conversations and introspection that 75 years after the Holocaust the threat of antisemitism remains and is rising.
Only three months ago, Temple Emanu-El was the target of a similar attack. And in 2016, three swastikas were drawn on a Temple Sinai window. The hurt is a searing reminder -- as if we needed yet another warning -- that the most successful and secure Jewish diaspora in the world is still vulnerable.
Last October, on the anniversary of the Pittsburgh Tree of Life Congregation massacre, my organization, American Jewish Committee (AJC), released the findings of a national survey of Jews on their own perceptions of and experiences with antisemitism in the United States.
88% said antisemitism is a problem in the United States today, with more than a third (38%) calling it a very serious problem. 84% said it had increased 43% said it had increased a lot over the past five years.
Significantly, one-third said that the institutions they are affiliated with had been targets of antisemitic attacks, and 22% of them said those institutions were victims of graffiti.
Antisemitism is not a Jewish problem. It is a problem for the entire society. AJC has long believed that fighting hatred and discrimination of one group or people is to fight hatred and discrimination of all people. We were gratified when civic, ethnic, and faith leaders in Sarasota joined with the Jewish community in January in the ""No Hate. No Fear"" rally the same day that similar gatherings took place in New York and cities across the country to demonstrate solidarity in response to violent attacks on Jews in Brooklyn and Monsey, NY.
We look to our elected officials and law enforcement to not only express empathy with the Jewish community by condemning antisemitism, but to commit resources to take concrete actions to apprehend and bring to justice those responsible and to prevent future attacks.
The Sheriff's Office has concluded that the dual attacks were the work of a lone perpetrator, seen on security cameras, and is actively seeking him. Thankfully, this perpetrator struck in the middle of the night. But, as we know all too well from the fatal attacks in Pittsburgh and Poway, the line is thin from vandalism or verbal antisemitism to arriving armed during services with the intent to kill.
Hence, Jewish community vigilance alone is not enough. Increased municipal security, as well as education and stronger legislation, are essential.
In 2018, the U.S. Congress passed, and President Trump signed into law, the Protecting Religiously Affiliated Institutions Act, which provided new and strengthened measures to deter, as well as punish, perpetrators of attacks on religious institutions.
Also critical is ensuring that antisemitic incidents are properly recorded locally and then reported to the FBI. Currently, the annual FBI Hate Crimes Statistics report relies on voluntary submissions from local law enforcement agencies.
For the last report, covering the year 2018, more than 90% of Florida law-enforcement agencies told the FBI that no hate crimes occurred in their districts or ignored the request. The FBI reported only 141 hate crime incidents in Florida. In a separate report, the Florida Attorney General's office recorded 168 hate crimes statewide in 2018. In comparison, states with much smaller populations than Florida recorded more hate crime incidents. New Jersey, for example, had 561.
To correct inadequacies, the bipartisan National Opposition to Hate, Assaults, and Threats to Equality (NO HATE) Act, adopted by the U.S. House of Representatives and now under consideration in the Senate, would improve hate crimes reporting. Department of Justice grants would empower state and local governments to train law enforcement, create reporting hotlines, direct resources to minority communities, conduct public educational forums, and require submitting hate crimes data to the FBI.
Even as our nation confronts the COVID-19 pandemic and racial injustice, we must ensure that combating antisemitism and Jewish community security remain a top priority. Together, in concert with our neighbors and partners, we will assertively combat the cancer of antisemitism.

I'm Philippa Thomas and we are looking this week at virus and prejudice. Next, a young photographer in New York City sees a rise in abuse directed at Asian-American basis. So I was waiting in line to enter a grocery store a day after the shelter-in-place order was officially announced here in New York City, and there were clear signs for social distancing but the man behind me was hovering right behind me so close to the point where I could almost feel his breath, and he didn't have a mask on. I politely asked him for some space to which he responded, ""What did you say to me, chink?"" And proceeded to cut in front of me. At this point, I was already anticipating an increase in hate crimes against Asian-Americans since Trump had made his first reference to a Chinese virus about four days prior to my incident but I wanted to believe my experience was kind of an isolated incident since I live in such a racially and culturally diverse city like New York City. So Haruka, that happened to you, and then you start asking around and realise this isn't an isolated incident? Right, so I started to realise that there was a pattern of these incidents and I started to do some research, I found several Facebook groups where Asian-Americans were self-reporting incidents of racial aggression via text and video, and I also came across some advocacy organisations like Chinese for Affirmative Action that compiled a virtual map of aggravated incident reports from Asian-Americans who had experienced racial aggressions"

39,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_251/Files (250).DOCX","Associated Press State & Local",2020-07-02,"585 words","STATE AND REGIONAL","MARINA VILLENEUVE, Associated Press",NA,"Groups worry new law will land more New Yorkers behind bars",FALSE,"ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — A new state law in New York allows judges to set bail for more criminal charges than originally allowed under a sweeping 2019 reform that largely did away with cash bail for many people awaiting trial.
Several criminal justice reform groups and state lawmakers raised concern at a Thursday virtual news conference that the amended law, which goes into effect in July, will land more people behind bars amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
“Legislators rolled back bail reform knowing that it would put more people in jail,"" said Roger Clark, a community leader with the #HALTsolitary campaign and VOCAL-NY. “It’s unconscionable.”
Last year, the Democratic-led Legislature passed a landmark state law that ruled out money bail and pretrial detention for most misdemeanor and nonviolent felony charges.
Supporters pointed out that cash bail allows the wealthy to avoid jail while awaiting charges and hoped the reform would prevent others from repeating the fate of Bronx resident Kalief Browder, who was 16 when he was sent to Rikers after being accused of stealing a backpack. He spent three years there, nearly two in solitary confinement, before eventually being released without facing a trial. He later killed himself.
But when the law went into effect in January, law enforcement agencies across New York raised alarm about public safety as the state's jails and prisons began releasing individuals awaiting trial.
Republicans and other critics raised concern over individual cases of people committing new offenses after being released under the bail law.
In April, Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Democratic legislative leaders agreed to amend the law to allow judges to set bail for more crimes, including misdemeanor bail jumping.
The expanded list of non-violent felonies eligible for bail and remand now includes: certain hate crimes, leaving the scene of a fatal accident, knowingly participating in a criminal enterprise, first-degree criminal possession or sale of a controlled substance, vehicular assault, criminal possession of a weapon on school grounds, money laundering and criminally negligent homicide.
New York City saw 40% fewer people behind bars from April 2019 to March 2020 — a drop of close to 2,000 people, according to the Center for Court Innovation's May report on the bail law.
And the state's jails saw a 45% drop in pretrial detention from April 2019 to February 2020, according to the report.
It’s unclear what effect the newly amended law will have statewide.
But New York City alone could see a 16% increase in individuals eligible for bail, according to the New York-based Center for Court Innovation, which looked at 2019 cases where a city judge ordered bail or remand.
Cuomo has defended the amended law as an improvement.
“The facts are Gov. Cuomo has not only advocated for — but actually achieved — historic reforms to the criminal justice system,"" Cuomo spokesman Jason Conwall said. ""New York is the least incarcerative and safest large state in the nation and the Governor closed more prisons than any governor in state history, overseeing an unprecedented 37% decline in the incarcerated population.”
As the pandemic peaked in April, his top aide Melissa DeRosa said the change would not take effect for 90 days and would not necessarily “translate into more people” behind bars.
New York City has reported the deaths of three incarcerated individuals and eleven corrections staffers due to COVID-19, while 312 inmates and 1,418 corrections staffers have tested positive."

French judges have ruled that the two suspects accused of murdering Holocaust survivor Mireille Knoll will stand trial for the alleged antisemitic motivation of their heinous crime. The ruling comes after prosecutors announced in May their intention to add the account to the charges they were pursuing. Knoll, who escaped deportation to a Nazi death camp when French police rounded up Jews in Paris in 1942, was found in her burning apartment stabbed 11 times on March 23, 2018.
Representative Council of Jewish Institutions of France (CRIF) President and WJC Vice President Francis Kalifat welcomed the decision of the court and urged the judiciary to apply the same to the murderers of Sarah Halimi, a 65-year-old Jewish woman who was hurled to her death from her apartment window in 2017. Earlier this year, a Paris Appeals Court exonerated her murderer due to his prior consumption of cannabis. “There can be no right without justice,” Kalifat wrote on Twitter, in response to the ruling regarding Knoll’s murderers.
Mireille Knoll’s murder prompted widespread outrage across France, including from French President Emmanuel Macron, who described her killing as a 'dreadful crime' and reaffirmed his 'absolute determination to fight against antisemitism'. On the day of her funeral, which was attended by Macron, thousands of people from a diversity of backgrounds took part in silent marches to express solidarity with Knoll's family and the Jewish French community.
Following the murder, the WJC held a memorial at its headquarters in New York with the participation of French Consul General Anne-Claire Legendre. 'No human being should ever have to live in fear of being a target of such aggression because of race, religion or any other factor,” said WJC President Ronald S. Lauder. 'We have now had too many wake-up calls, in Europe and on other continents.”
In July 2018, WJC Jewish Diplomat Caroline Berdugo delivered a moving statement about Knoll’s murder on the floor of the United Nations Human Rights Council, saying “Mireille Knoll could have been my grandmother. Mireille Knoll is my grandmother. Mireille Knoll is our grandmother.”
The French Interior Ministry recently published a report finding that Jews in France were the target of a majority of hate crimes, despite being less than 1% of France’s population. Out of the 1,142 hate crimes recorded in the country last year, a staggering 687 (60.2%) were against Jewish individuals, a nearly 27% increase from 2018."

Stallard at a supermarket in Jeffersontown, Ky., in 2018 in a racially-motivated attack.
A white man who fatally shot two Black people at a Kroger supermarket in Jeffersontown, Ky., in 2018 in a racially-motivated attack was sentenced this week to life in prison without the possibility of parole. 
 At a court hearing on Tuesday, the gunman, Gregory Bush, pleaded guilty but mentally ill to the murders of Vickie Lee Jones and Maurice E. Stallard.
 Mr. Bush, 53, also pleaded guilty to criminal attempted murder and wanton endangerment in connection with the Oct. 24, 2018, shooting in the Louisville suburb. 
 He is also expected to plead guilty to federal hate crime charges in connection with the shootings, a move that will allow him to avoid the death penalty, according to court documents. 
 Mr. Stallard, 69, an Air Force veteran, had been shopping with his 12-year-old grandson to buy materials for a school project when Mr. Bush shot him several times inside the Kroger, according to the police. Mr. Bush then went out to the parking lot and killed Ms. Jones, 67, who had retired from a Department of Veterans Affairs hospital and had been caring for her ailing mother.
 Mr. Bush did not know either of the two victims, whose families spoke at his sentencing in Jefferson Circuit Court in Louisville. 
 ''You can't hate someone that much just for the color of their skin,'' said Charlotte Stallard, the widow of Mr. Stallard. ''You have ruined my life.''
 Mr. Stallard's daughter Kellie Watson, who had been the chief equity officer for the city of Louisville, also spoke at the hearing. 
 ''Our life has changed forever,'' she said, ''and the man's life that you took meant something.'' 
 Shortly before the shooting, Mr. Bush tried unsuccessfully to enter First Baptist Church of Jeffersontown, a predominantly Black church, officials said. 
 Just after the shootings, the son of a witness told a local television station that his father had heard the gunman make a racist remark during the episode, though the police said they could not confirm that account.
 Mr. Bush has a history of mental illness, according to the authorities. In 2019, he had been declared not competent to stand trial, but the determination was reversed after he underwent treatment. 
 In Kentucky, a person who pleads guilty but mentally ill is entitled to receive treatment and psychiatric care under the criminal statutes. 
 Angela Elleman, a lawyer for Mr. Bush, told the television station WDRB in a statement after the sentencing that his guilty plea hopefully shed light on Mr. Bush's mental state at the time of the killings.
 ''On the day of this tragedy, Mr. Bush's schizophrenia was not medicated, so he was tortured by voices that threatened to kill him and his family,'' she said. ''He acted out of his psychosis and his illness.''
 The prosecutor in the case, Thomas B. Wine, said in a statement that state legislators should remember the victims as they take up hate crime legislation in Kentucky. 
 ''Vickie Jones and Maurice Stallard were senselessly murdered because of the color of their skin,'' Mr. Wine said. ''Our entire community and commonwealth had suffered a loss because of racial enmity.''

Police and residents shared pictures online showing knotted ropes tied to the park's trees with plastic pipes hanging from them. These were promptly removedby city officials.Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf denounced the discovery on Wednesday and said police would begin investigating.The Oakland Police Department subsequently notified the FBI[2] about the nooses and asked for their assistance in the investigation, Schaaf confirmed.""The evidence has been turned over to the FBI and I want to be clear that regardless of the intentions of whoever put the nooses in our public trees, in our sacred public space here in Oakland intentions don't matter,"" Schaaf said. 
Some residents have come out in defense of the ropes, saying it was misinterpreted. Victor Sengbe toldSan Francisco ABC-affiliate, KGO-TV,[3]the ropes likely weren't nooses.'Out of the dozen and hundreds and thousands of people that walked by, no one has thought that it looked anywhere close to a noose,' Sengbe said.

These acts may send an unintended message,' police said in a statement. 'We recognize especially at this time, that any ropes on or attached to trees, limbs or other objects can be associated with hate crimes and racial violence.'The discovery comes nearly a week after the bodies of Robert Fuller, 24, and Malcolm Harsch, 38,[4] were found hanging from trees in Palmdaleand Victorville, respectively. Fuller's death was initially ruled a suicide by the Los Angeles County medical examiner while a ruling hasn't been issued on Harsch's death, but police said there were no signs of foul play.This prompted fierce backlash from relatives of both men and the Black Lives Matter movement, who called the deaths suspicious and said they believed the men may have been lynched. Subsequent protests have been held demanding police conduct thorough investigations into the deaths. Two teachers from a school in Long Island, New York, were fired and one teacher was suspended after they had a display of images depicting nooses in their classroom.

Social media companies have begun removing posts from people who photograph themselves kneeling on a friend's necks similar to the manner in which George Floyd died in police custody, according to news reports.
Facebook has removed photos associated with an online viral challenge called the “George Floyd Challenge,” The New York Post reported Wednesday.
The posts associated shows people with their knees on someone else's neck, according to The New York Post, similar to how Minneapolis, Minnesota police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for more than 8 minutes May 25, as shown a video recording of the incident.
Three teens have been arrested as part of hate crime investigations in the United Kingdom earlier for posting images as part of the challenge, The New York Post reported.

“We are aware, and are removing these posts for violating our Community Standards,” a Facebook spokesperson told The New York Post, adding that the accounts are “encouraging participation in a high-risk viral challenge.”
Twitter has also removed photos mimicking Floyd's death. (RELATED: George Floyd Autopsy Shows 'Fentanyl Intoxication' And 'Recent Methamphetamine Use')
“We're taking action [against] tweets encouraging or promoting this as well as tweets that condone or justify this behavior,” a Twitter spokesperson told Business Insider Wednesday, adding that the images violate the platform's policies against abusive behavior.
Twitter has also placed a label on tweets denouncing the online challenge, according to the spokesperson. Twitter confirmed to the Daily Caller News Foundation that the company has started removing the posts with the photos as part of the challenge.
Demonstrations sprang up following Floyd's death May 25 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Chauvin and three other police officers on the scene were immediately fired after the incident, and Chauvin faces charges of manslaughter and 2nd degree murder. The other three officers also face charges.
Facebook has not responded to the DCNF's request for comment about the posts.

They say the term, along with the phrases ""China virus,"" ""Wuhan virus,"" and ""Wu-flu,"" are racist, and draw attention away from the president's handling of the coronavirus.
Shirley Ng, co-founder of Concerned AsAm citizens of NYC, a grassroots organization, said during the group's ""Asians Are Not A Virus"" campaign in Manhattan Chinatown, Trump is using the trope of China to distract from his administration's record on COVID-19.
""He's always trying to deflect,"" Ng told UPI. ""It's not him, it's always somebody else.""
Since the outbreak of the global coronavirus pandemic, Ng has been active on social media but felt calling out anti-Asian racism online wasn't enough. In May, Ng and her co-organizers, with the help of nearly 50 volunteers, launched their first campaign, ""Don't Be Cruel,"" to inform Chinese American and other minority-owned businesses in New York to notify police if they encounter race-based harassment, or a hate crime.
CAAC NYC's campaign on Saturday drew curious looks from random passersby at the corner of a street adjacent to Columbus Park, where the members of the local Chinatown community gather to practice Tai Chi or play chess. Some people declined to sign the posters against racist speech, even as others jumped immediately at the opportunity.
Lillian Bit, a resident of Long Island, stopped by the group's table to sign posters, which Ng says will be sent to the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus in Washington.
Trump is ""inciting division"" among Americans, and using phrases like ""Kung Flu virus"" to divert from his own mishandling of the coronavirus, Bit, who is Chinese American, said.
Other people stopped by the table to speak to Ng and the other organizers, initially unsure about the campaign.
Nelson Wong, a businessman with an office in Chinatown, said he did not have problems with Trump associating the coronavirus with China.
""What's the problem with the 'Wuhan virus'?"" Wong said, referring to the origins of the disease.
Wong, who grew up in the neighborhood of Brownsville in Brooklyn in the '70s, said the outcry over recent anti-Asian racism may have deeper roots, and that Trump is not entirely to blame for the more than 2,200 reported anti-Asian hate incidents since the start of the pandemic.
""I was a bony Asian kid in Brownsville,"" said Wong. ""I had to literally fight my way through school, or I had to hide from people after school so I could get home.""
Wong also said the dynamics of anti-Asian or anti-Chinese racism is complex, the perpetrators are not always White, and experiences with racism like his are not always addressed in his community.
Other Asian Americans disagree the recent surge in anti-Asian hate crimes have only a tenuous connection to the coronavirus pandemic and its association with China.
Judy Ng, a CAAC NYC co-organizer, said she was walking to a grocery store when a pedestrian, a man, covered his face as he approached her.
The move felt ambiguously hostile, but enough to catch Ng's eye. As COVID-19 ran its course in New York, Ng, a single parent with a child, said she found herself staying indoors and hardly going outside.
Ng said she made her first major outing when meeting with Shirley at the end of May to prepare for the campaigns.
Shirley Ng said her campaign delivers a message of hope to Asian Americans who have opted to stay in for fear of hate attacks.
""I don't want them to live that way,"" Ng said. ""That's what the racists want you to do. They want you to live in fear."""

Both have been ruled suicides.
An investigation has confirmed that Robert Fuller, who was found hanging from a tree in a Southern California park on June 10, committed suicide, officials announced on Thursday.
The authorities ordered a further investigation into Mr. Fuller’s death following a public outcry after the initial ruling that it was a suicide. His hanging and that of another Black man in California, on May 31, drew scrutiny amid nationwide Black Lives Matter protests. The other hanging has also been ruled a suicide.
At a news conference on Thursday, Chris Marks, the department commander of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, said that a further investigation and a more-detailed autopsy revealed that Mr. Fuller, 24, had a history of mental health issues and committed suicide.
Records indicated that Mr. Fuller had suffered from mental illness and had previously expressed suicidal thoughts, Commander Marks said.
The authorities also said there was a May 14 purchase on Mr. Fuller’s debit card of a red rope consistent with the one used in the hanging.
There were no signs of a struggle or trauma visible on Mr. Fuller’s body, which was found hanging in a city park in Palmdale, north of Los Angeles, but there were several scars on his left wrist, Commander Marks said.
No witnesses were seen in the area, he added.
Mr. Fuller’s family cooperated with the investigation, the authorities said. Local authorities originally ruled his death a suicide in June, but were met with backlash from Mr. Fuller’s family and activists who wanted them to further investigate the death, including the possibility that the hanging was a hate crime.
Jamon R. Hicks, a lawyer for Mr. Fuller’s family, said on Friday that a private investigation that the family requested had not uncovered evidence of foul play or a struggle before Mr. Fuller’s death.
“There is nothing to indicate any threats; there’s nothing to indicate, again, any foul play,” he said. “There were no racist sentiments, no symbols or anything in the area. So we don’t have any information to suggest that it was a hate crime.”
He said that Mr. Fuller’s family was grieving after learning the results of the official investigation.
“The family just received the information yesterday,” Mr. Hicks said. “They’re processing the information. They trust our team. And they are listening to what we say about the fact that there’s been no evidence of foul play.”
Mr. Fuller’s death was the second oftwo hangings in Southern California that drew national attention amid the nationwide protests incited by the death of George Floyd. Malcolm Harsch, 38, was found hanging from a tree on May 31. After initially advocating a deeper investigation, Mr. Harsch’s family announced that they believed his hanging death was a suicide.

The president of San Francisco State University has defended her decision to allow a talk to go ahead featuring Palestinian militant, Leila Khaled, who was among those to hijack a flight to New York City in the 1970s. 
Khaled is scheduled to speak at a virtual class event hosted by the university next week despite outrage and objections from Jewish students and groups who have said they are 'deeply distressed' by her inclusion. 
The event, which is titled 'Whose Narratives? Gender, Justice and Resistance', has been organized by the university's Arab and Muslim Ethnicities and Diasporas Studies program. 
The talk has been billed as a 'historic roundtable conversation with Palestinian feminist, militant and leader', according to one of the advertisements. 
Khaled is a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which is a group designated by the US Department of State as a terror organization. 
The 76-year-old also took part in two plane hijackings in 1969 and 1970. She was arrested in London after the second flight, which was travelling from Amsterdam to New York City, was rerouted. 
The militant ended up being swapped in a prisoner exchange for civilian hostages that were taken by the terror group in a separate incident. 
After facing objections from Jewish students over Khaled's scheduled appearance, the university's president Lynn Mahoney defended her decision to allow the talk to go ahead. 
In an op-ed published by the Jewish News, Mahoney said she condemned hate but welcomed a diversity of opinions. 
'San Francisco State University is again at the center of a national discussion about the boundaries and consequences of freedom of expression, this time brought about because two faculty members have invited Leila Khaled to participate in a virtual class discussion,' Mahoney said. 
'Let me be clear: I condemn the glorification of terrorism and use of violence against unarmed civilians. I strongly condemn antisemitism and other hateful ideologies that marginalize people based on their identities, origins or beliefs. 
'At the same time, I represent a public university, which is committed to academic freedom and the ability of faculty to conduct their teaching and scholarship without censorship. 
'Our university is among the most diverse in the nation, where students frequently encounter divergent viewpoints and world views, which plays an essential role in the development of the burgeoning minds of our students. It is our obligation to utilize moments such as these to heap on more learning, engage in more debate, and challenge viewpoints and assumptions.
'Rather than stifle speech, we must encourage robust questioning and dissent, and ensure that our students and faculty are free from retaliation or censorship for doing so.'
She said a recent meeting she had with students had 'enhanced my appreciation for the deeply painful impact of this upcoming presenter, as well as past campus experiences'. 
In open letter to Mahoney, students affiliated with SF Hillel - a Jewish student life group associated with the school - said that while they appreciate academic freedom they also expect academic responsibility. 
They wrote that they are 'still deeply distressed by this blatant violation of that responsibility' by allowing Khaled to speak. 
'We are worried about the normalization of violent rhetoric. We live in a world with rising violent hate crime rates against Jews and other minority communities, where divisive rhetoric emboldens teenagers to take up arms and threaten acts of violence. 
'Seeing someone who engaged in terror be held up as a role model, we are worried about the potential for hateful or dangerous backlash.' 
Rabab Ibrahim Abdulhadi, one of the professors who organized the talk, penned a Facebook post last month saying she was honored to host Khaled, who she described as a 'revolutionary Palestinian militant and feminist icon'.
'I wanted to grow up to become another Leila Khaled,' the professor wrote. 'Her steadfastness, resilience and resistance has and continues to be a huge inspiration to me and to generations of Palestinian women.'
Abdulhadi acknowledged that 'Zionist groups will undoubtedly become bothered again'.
'They will ask the university to punish us for bringing the voices of marginalized communities to the fore and for shining a light on what oppression and resistance mean.' "

But the New York Times only gives a single answer: 'The only motive for these crimes is the origin, real or presumed, of these people; their Judaism,' Galina Elbaz, a lawyer representing the International League Against Racism and Anti-Semitism, said at the trial. 'It's the conspiracy-minded idea that originated with the far right, the idea that Jews have a grip on power,' she said.I cannot find Ms. Elbaz' full testimony at the trial, but the head of her organization, the Ligue Internationale Contre le Racisme et l'Antismitisme writes about the trial on their website, and what they have to say sounds nothing like the tiny part quoted by the NYT: My purpose was to remind people that LICRA stands alongside the victims of this anti-Semitic crime. The assassin Amedy Coulibaly had said during the attack 'You are the two things I hate the most in the world. You are Jewish and French.' Universalism wants all French people to be Jews when there is an anti-Semitic attack. When a Jew is affected, it is the Republic, the whole of France, which is damaged. This process must be a moment of awakening. I would like us to be able to say loud and clear: today we are all Jews and French. I also wanted to remind you that, from the experience we have acquired at LICRA since 1927, in particular at the Barbie, Touvier, Papon, and Merah trials, and at the trials of the Tutsi genocidaires, it is that hate crime is not based on small reasons. The hand of the anti-Semite who kills is supported by a multitude of complicit hands, a mechanism in which everyone has their share of responsibility in the final act that is committed or in the fact of not having prevented it. If one of the links is missing then the pursued victim is annihilated.Based on this and other articles on the LICRA website, it is clear that they understand that antisemitism is not strictly a right-wing phenomenon. In fact, it has nothing to do with Right or Left. Islamist antisemitism may have borrowed from the tropes of an all-powerful Jewish cabal running the world, but that is hardly only a far-Right idea. There is cross-pollination of antisemitic ideas between all antisemitic movements, whether they are Nation of Islam or Arab or Muslim or Black Hebrew or white nationalist or socialist. One of the founding documents of Soviet ""anti-Zionism,"" Yuri Ivanov's ""Beware: Zionism[2],"" is based on the exact same antisemitic lie of a cabal of rich Jews (mostly Rothschilds) who are pulling the strings of capitalism and the media. While Ivanov insists he has nothing against Jews, he sure spends a lot of time railing against the ""wealthy Jewish bourgeoisie"" who are behind Zionism. Clearly the idea of an all-powerful Jewish conspiracy that holds the reigns of power is not only a right-wing belief, and it animated Leftist ""anti-Zionism""from its inception. Assuming that Elbaz' testimony about the root causes of antisemitism was longer than one sentence, the New York Times chose to cherry pick her answer to the titular question to only blame the Right for antisemitism - even Islamist Jew-hatred.

On Friday he reached in New London Superior Court for his litigation and was served with new apprehension authorizations accusing him with placing bothering phone calls to Caldwell's attorney.
The felon got arrested after he and his 27-year-old girlfriend, Emily Orbay, reached at the courthouse for their first court lawsuit for cases that they assaulted Caldwell two times at the Quality Inn in Mystic as they were upset there was no hot water in their room. The felon is 39 year old Philip Sarner, of Brooklyn.
Sarner was supposed to give a $30,000 bail for the new case of second-degree bothering, which is in along with the $75,000 he issued after getting accused with second-degree attack, third-degree attack and bothering grounded on bigotry or bias.
The day after Stonington police recognized Sarner and Orbay as the couple shown hitting Caldwell in hotel surveillance video, Sarner called attorney M. John Strafaci's New London law firm five times between 8:41 a.m. and 8:50 a.m. on July 7. The longest call was of 34 seconds. The calls were not taped.
At one of the calls, Sarner said to a receptionist who answered the phone, ""John Strafaci, watch your back. You will be the next one,"" according to an apprehension authorization issued by Master Patrol Officer James Suarez of the New London Police Department.
The same person called back and left a message for Strafaci with Strafaci's son, lawyer M. Joseph Strafaci, in which he said, ""If he loves Blacks so much he can (perform a sexual act on her.).""
The other calls were hang-ups. The caller ID displayed ""anonymous,"" but after Stonington police did inspection on the number Sarner gave them after his apprehension, phone files from AT&T showed the calls started from Sarner's number.
Sarner used the number on the day of the hotel situation, to call New London police from Lawrence + Memorial Hospital to inform that he was getting warned by a group of people.
On Friday when Sarner and Orbay reached at the Huntington Street Courthouse, they walked by Caldwell, her attorney and about 40 supporters who wore ""Justice for Crystal"" and ""Black Lives Matter"" T-shirts, carried signs condemning racism, prayed together and shouted. Members of the groups Ray of Hope for Racial Equality and Peace and We Won't Stand Down stated it was important to stand with Caldwell and to send a message that racism won't be accepted in Connecticut.
Raeven Kelly-Dinwoodie of Stonington said, ""It is incumbent upon all of us to speak out when we see violent atrocities in our community, especially when they're motivated by hate.
At the hotel assault, Caldwell told Sarner called her ""an old monkey"" and told her, ""Your life doesn't matter.""
The situation took to protests and criticism of Stonington police for not immediately apprehending the couple after the situation. Sarner and Orbay went back to New York and could not be seen for over two weeks.
The first cases declared by Stonington police did not have the hate crime allegation, but State's Attorney Michael L. Regan stated the matter was getting probed and stated that the bigotry/bias charge. Tamara Lanier, vice president of the New London branch of the NAACP, talked with Regan about the hate crime charge.
Judge Hunchu Kwak went on with the issues to 9 October after issuing protective orders obstructing Sarner and Orbay from having contact with Caldwell and attorney Strafaci, and their family members, and from going to the Quality Inn and Strafaci's New London law firm.
Attorney Kevin Smith of the Pattis & Smith law firm stated before the court appearance that he couldn't talk a defense as he hadn't got all of the proofs. He stated the firm is representing both Sarner and Orbay and that he doesn't anticipate a conflict.
At the time debating for a lessened bail for Sarner, Smith said, ""We obviously would dispute the nature of the assault"" and he noted Sarner had showed up for court. Sarner, who was connected to the courtroom by video feed from the lockup, tried several times to cut in and speak to the judge, but then agreed to Smith's advice to remain silent.
Orbay is pregnant, and faced for sometime before the judge.
Senior Assistant State's Attorney David J. Smith (no relation to the defense attorney) is probing the matter, and Victim Services Advocate Johanna Krebs will be supporting Caldwell in the process.
Strafaci stated justice for Caldwell means detention of her assaulters and reimbursement for her medical expenses, which she is expected to receive through workers compensation. Caldwell is 59 and is retired and only worked part time at the hotel.
He said, ""We don't have plans for any civil lawsuits.
Strafaci stated Caldwell doesn't blame Stonington police for the attack.
He said, ""We're upset they didn't take it seriously, probably because she is a Black woman from Groton and not a white woman from Mystic.
Caldwell has post-traumatic stress disorder and had her first appointment with a therapist. It was on Thursday.
Her supporters reached in a circle around her and told Caldwell, one by one, how she has inspired them with her bravery and dignity from the assault outside the courthouse.
Caldwell said, ""You have no idea that my strength is coming from you. 2020 Legal Monitor Worldwide."

In late 2019, the first case of novel coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China. Since then, the world has seen more than 52 million cases and more than 1.2 million deaths.
COVID-19 has put all Americans in harm’s way, but it has made life particularly unsafe for the Asian American community. We need to do something about this.
Hate crimes and microaggressions against those in the Asian American community have increased since the beginning of the pandemic. More than 2,000 race-related hate incidents against Asian Americans were reported between March and June. That’s reported incidents. No one knows for sure how many incidents have gone unreported.
Asian Americans live in a constant loop of microaggressions and hate because of ignorance and racism. Incumbent President Donald J. Trump’s rhetoric has further incited anti-Asian sentiments.
When an Asian American reporter, Weijia Jiang of CBS News, asked Trump a question in May about his handling of the pandemic, he responded by blaming China: “Maybe that is a question you should ask China. Don’t ask me. Ask China that question.”
Trump continually relies on aggressive language when describing the virus. He has compared himself to a wartime president fighting an unseen enemy. His word choices villainize Chinese Americans as the enemy and encourage hatred toward them.
Calling COVID-19 the “Chinese virus” is a racist microaggression that directly hurts Asian Americans and it fuels mistrust and hatred.
Unfortunately, anti-Asian racism is not new in the United States, and history tends to repeat itself. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 prohibited the immigration of all Chinese laborers; that law wasn’t repealed until 1943.
In 2020, however, it’s abundantly clear that Asian Americans are fighting two pandemics: anti-Asian racism and a deadly virus.

On the fateful day, which turns 19-year-oldtoday, the terrorist group Al-Qaida launched a series of four coordinated attacks against the USA using four hijacked passenger airplanes. While the two of the planes crashed into the Twin Towers of New York City's World Trade Center, a third was flown into the Pentagon, the Department of Defense headquarters near Washington. Passengers on the fourth plane, likely bound for the White House, retook control of the aircraft and crashed it into a field in Pennsylvania.
The wounds inflicted in theSeptember 11terror attacks remain as freshtoday. Nearly 3,000 people died and about 25,000 were injured. And while everyone in the country has been affected negatively in some way as the securitization of everyday life that came in the wake of the crisis, the group that has suffered the most are the Arab immigrants and the American Muslims, because of the one thing they had in common with the terrorist group - their religion.
Muslims in America since then faced extraordinary rendition, interrogation, surveillance, random searches, acts of vandalism and hate crime and sometimes, even detentions and deportations. They were singled out and targeted by both the government and the public.
""I was made aware that I was not a full-Americanafter 9/11. It's like I went to sleep an American and woke up an Arab,"" said Dena Kuko, a student in California in an interview to an American television channel. She said that her loyalty and allegiance to America was questioned, even in the community she called home for decades.
An ongoing academic debate about Arab Muslims in America suggests that mass media have branded them as the inferior, hostile, and backward 'enemy within.' Yaqin and Morey state inFraming Muslims: Stereotyping and Representation After 9/11that Muslims in the United States have been unjustly stigmatized by the western media to exclude them from societal privileges.
The targeting of a specific group of people in a time of national emergency, based on a putative national or religious affiliation with the 'enemy,' seems to be embedded in the history of the US, the most prominent example being the Japanese Internment during World War II. According to Robert Asahina, Visiting Scholar at the Asian-Pacific-American Studies Institute at New York University, parallels can be drawn in comparing the Japanese Internment and the treatment of Muslims after the events of 9/11 with regards to some faultlines of American democracy.
These fissures are exacerbated in wartime: the tendency to diminish the civil liberties of certain groups of people, often marginalized, to guarantee national security.
In his Presidential campaign in 2016, Donald Trump commented that he has seen ""thousands of Muslims"" celebrating after the 9/11 attacks. ""I watched when the World Trade Center came tumbling down, and I watched in New Jersey where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down,"" he said. He further said ""hundreds to thousands across the world"" agreed and supported his ""truth.""
In September 2015, at a campaign rally, Trump nodded along as a supporter claimed ""we have a problem in this country; it's called Muslims."" Trump continued nodding, saying ""right,"" and ""we need this question!"" He also called for a ""complete and total ban of Muslims from entering the United States.""
""There is a lot of negative rhetoric,"" a Muslim businessman in the US quoted toThe New York Times. ""The negative rhetoric is causing the hate, and in turn, the hate is causing the violent acts.""
And that hatred for Muslims is common between India and the USA, Amnesty said. Ahead of Trump's visit to India in February, the human rights organization said ""anti-Muslim sentiment permeates"" in the policies of both the United States and Indian heads of the state. ""For decades, the US-India relationship was anchored by claims of shared values of human rights and human dignity. Now, those shared values are discrimination, bigotry, and hostility towards refugees and asylum seekers,"" it said.
Only time will tell whether Arab and Muslim Americans will ever achieve the goal of being equitably included as regular Americans, or as the history suggests, which group will replace them as the demons of tomorrow.

Recent incidents include a New York woman who called the police on a Black bird-watcher in Central Park[2]; an Alameda, Calif., Black man who was arrested after a woman reported him for dancing in the street[3]; and a San Francisco woman who called the police on a Filipino neighbor for writing 'Black Lives Matter' in chalk[4] in front of his house. The proposed San Francisco legislation would hold people liable for calling 911 to report something they know is false or exaggerated, and based on racial bias. Fellow San Francisco Supervisor Matt Haney co-authored the bill, and noted in a tweet[5]: 'Racist false reports put people in danger and waste resources.' In a statement, Walton said he aims to join a statewide effort by California State Assemblymember Rob Bonta of Oakland, who has introduced similar legislation. While it is already illegal to file a false police report, that legislation would add a hate-crime designation to reports based on racial bias. The bill 'will impose serious consequences on those who make 911 calls that are motivated by hate and bigotry; actions that inherently cause harm and pain to others,' Bonta said in a statement[6]. Bonta stressed that his proposal does not seek to discourage people from calling 911 to report real emergencies. However, 'racist and discriminatory 911 calls are dangerous, demeaning and demoralizing to the person falsely accused. They further deteriorate community-police relations and contribute to the inaccurate and harmful over-criminalization of black and brown communities,' Bonta said in a statement. 'If you are afraid of a black family barbecuing in the community park, a man dancing and doing his normal exercise routine in the bike lane, or someone who asks you to comply with dog leash laws in a park, and your immediate response is to call the police, the real problem is with your own personal prejudice.'

Serino: NY's 41st Senate district candidates on the issues",FALSE,"This November, local businesswoman Karen Smythe will face GOP State Senator Sue Serino in what will be her second attempt to flip District 41-the traditionally conservative stronghold in which Poughkeepsie is located-blue. Throughout her campaign, Smythe has focused her rhetoric on imperatives for racial justice reform, reproductive rights and the need for new leadership. Meanwhile, Serino has stuck to her small government instincts while criticizing New York State's unilaterally Democratic leadership and their pandemic response. Below are the candidates' views on some of this year's most pressing issues:
Racial Justice
Smythe has marched with and expressed strong support for the Black Lives Matter movement. She feels that the state should work to reinvest in mental health support, which the police should not be responsible for, and that racial disparities in minor drug convictions must be addressed. Smythe hopes to create a community fund to give low-income, predominantly residents of color capital to start businesses and acknowledges the need to flatten racial inequities in early education and housing.
Soon after the death of George Floyd, Serino spoke out in support of the movement for racial justice and took part in a peaceful prayer walk in the City of Poughkeepsie. Since then, she has voted in favor of bills requiring instruction on symbols of hate in grades 6-12, establishing a hate crimes training program for law enforcement and extending the definition of ""race"" and racial-based discrimiantion to hair texture and style. At the same time, Serino voted against S.8496, which authorizes disclosure of law enforcement disciplinary records, and S.6579, which limits penalties for marijuana possession.
Reproductive Rights
Smythe, who has been endorsed by Planned Parenthood, EMILY's List and the National Institute for Reproductive Rights, supports the Reproductive Health Act , which codified Roe v. Wade protections into New York State law. She has emphasized the need to protect reproductive health care access and says that this health care should not be tied to employment.
Serino, who opposed the RHA, insists that New York has ""never done anything to roll back the clock"" on Roe and, in 2018, said that she would oppose any measures restricting abortion access.
Sexual Violence
Smythe's platform prioritizes zero-tolerance for sexual harassment, and she supports the work of the Military Sexual Trauma Movement, which lobbies for a regulative authority that would allow victims of sexual assault to report incidents outside of their chain of command.
Serino has sponsored legislation to establish a sex trafficking awareness and prevention program, which prohibits sex offenders from being bus drivers and require sex offenders to verify their residence and registration on a biannual basis.
Gender Discrimination
Smythe supports equal pay for equal work policies as well as the strengthening of paid family and medical leave programs. She sharply opposes the GOP rollback of Obama-era protections for transgender Americans.
Serino voted against prohibiting discrimination based on gender identity and designating offenses regarding gender identity or expression as hate crimes.
Guns
Smythe supports the work of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, New Yorkers Against Gun Violence and various other groups advocating for gun control measures. She believes that ""protecting our kids from gun violence should not be a controversial or partisan issue"" and claims that Serino continues to block ""all"" gun safety measures.
Serino has co-sponsored legislation to repeal the 2013 SAFE Act, which the New York State Legislature passed after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting to increase penalties for illegal gun use and insists that the state should be focusing on mental health-related prevention. Serino also voted against S.8121, which ensures that convicted domestic abusers do not have access to firearms. In her most recent term, she opposed bills increasing penalties for improper gun storage, prohibiting firearms on school campuses and establishing 30-day waiting periods, while also voting to prohibit both bump stocks and 3D printed firearms and establish a firearm buyback program.
Environmental Policy
Smythe supports the 2019 Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, which sets binding goals for the state to achieve 85 percent emissions reduction by 2050 and ensures that at least 35-40 percent of climate infrastructure is directed to disadvantaged communities. Smythe also insists that we must invest in the region's drinking water infrastructure, encourage regenerative farming practices for local farms and create jobs in the emerging green technology sector.
Serino opposed the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act. She voted to establish a small business energy assistance program and prohibit offshore drilling.
Economic Infrastructure: Housing, Workforce and Broadband Infrastructure
Smythe has called for universal broadband access. In municipalities such as Poughkeepsie where many families cannot afford broadband, she suggests implementing a municipal broadband network. She asserts that while families and employers look to relocate outside of New York City, the Hudson Valley must leverage itself to attract emerging industries and make home ownership more accessible.
Serino hopes to expand broadband access by exempting high-needs communities from a fiber optic tax, which she says has disincentivized broadband development. She opposed a bill extending eviction protections for tenants during the emergency shutdown. This year she sponsored legislation requiring state economic development agencies to provide preference to small businesses in the programs that they administer.
Education
Smythe supports implementing anti-racist curricula in every level of K-12 education and building a more equitable tax system that will flatten the inequalities between wealthier and poorer school districts. Smythe believes that the Excelsior Scholarship, which grants certain New York students tuition-free attendance at CUNY and SUNY schools, should be more inclusive of part-time students and hopes to direct additional resources toward alternatives to four-year colleges.
Serino is a sharp critic of Common Core standards and is the creator of an Education Advisory Board that has proposed sweeping reforms to Common Core standards. She opposed granting undocumented immigrants access to higher education aid and establishing a school voter registration access program. Regarding the Excelsior Scholarship, Serino favors moving towards an ""enhanced,"" income based Tuition Assistance Program ."

""These hateful acts are a profound betrayal of our values as a university and a community,"" said school President Stuart Rabinowitz. ""We condemn discrimination, bias and prejudice in all its forms, and reaffirm our commitment to hold accountable any member of our community who fails to live up to Hofstra's core values of diversity and inclusion.""
 According to the report, the first incident occurred in mid-September and the second within the past week - both in the same dorm.
Hofstra journalism major Sarah Emily Baum discovered both instances and reported them to school officials, as well as to the Hofstra Clocktower - a student-run investigative reporting account.
In response, Rabinowitz said the school intends to run a multi-platform educational campaign to speak about university codes and values, reiterating that such acts are grounds for disciplinary action.
""There is no place for antisemitism or any other form of discrimination at Hofstra University,"" Rabinowitz said. ""Now more than ever, we must stand together against intolerance, bigotry and hate.""
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo condemned the incidents at Hofstra as well as a separate incident where a swastika was drawn into wet concrete before it dried.

""I am appalled and disgusted to learn of these heinous acts of hate in Merrick and at Hofstra University. The Jewish community is part of the New York family, and our state has zero tolerance for antisemitism,"" said Cuomo. 
""I want to assure the homeowner whose property was damaged and the Hofstra community that we will do everything in our power to bring the perpetrators to justice, which is why I am directing our Hate Crimes Task Force to assist the police in their investigations into these incidents,"" he added. ""Now more than ever - in the midst of the worst public health crisis in a century - we need to be united and show support for one another, and remember that love always conquers hate.""

Denouncing caught-on-video acts of police brutality, Cuomo said the state would also move to make police officers' disciplinary records public and declare the state attorney general as a prosecutor for police involved deaths.
""We want New York to be the progressive leader on these issues,"" he said.
He said the new measures would be taken up by legislators when they return to Albany.

""A bad police officer is the enemy of all good police officers,"" Cuomo said, shrugging off the possibility of a police exodus.
Cuomo spoke as the daily coronavirus death toll dipped again to just 35 people, the lowest total in two months. Hospitalization and infection rates also continued to drop.
""There is no state in the nation that went from where we were to where we are,"" he said.
The city is preparing to start the first stage of the reopening process on Monday. That will include manufacturing and construction, along with retail stores opening for pick up items only.
With more people expected back on the subways, the MTA has stockpiled 1 million masks and 500,000 two-ounce bottles of hand sanitizer to keep riders safe.
As the pandemic's impact continues to wane, Cuomo said houses of worship in upstate regions that are already in phase two of reopening can open faster than anticipated.
Churches, synagogues and mosques in those areas will be permitted to open immediately to 25% of their usual capacity.
Cuomo said some religious leaders are complaining to him that they would now have to deliver the same sermon four times to reach their flock."

Tropical Storm Fay edges north from off North Carolina coast
MIAMI - Tropical Storm Fay, the sixth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, began to edge away from the North Carolina coast Thursday evening, its sights set on the mid-Atlantic coast and southern New England.
The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said Fay was about 70 miles east of Cape Hatteras in its 8p.m. advisory, only hours after forecasters announced the storm's formation. The storm had top sustained winds of 45 mph and was moving to the north at 8 mph.
A tropical storm warning was issued Thursday afternoon from Cape May, N.J., to Watch Hill, R.I. The warning area includes Long Island and the Long Island Sound in New York, forecasters said.
El Paso shooting suspect faces more federal charges
EL PASO, Texas - A man accused of shooting scores of people at a Texas Walmart last summer was indicted Thursday on new federal hate crime and gun charges following the death of another person injured in the attack.
A grand jury returned a new indictment against Patrick Wood Crusius, who was already charged with 90 counts under federal hate crime and firearms laws for the shooting in the border city of El Paso. Authorities say Crusius aimed to scare Hispanics into leaving the United States.
The new charges stem from 36-year-old Guillermo ""Memo"" Garcia's death nine month after the August 3 massacre, making him its 23rd fatality. They mirror a similar move by county prosecutors in the state capital murder case against Crusius.

I am writing on behalf of the New York State Coalition Against Domestic Violence's (NYSCADV) response to the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) proposed rule change published in the Federal Register on July 24, 2020 (RIN 2506-AC53; HUD Docket No. FR-6152-P-01) entitled, ""Making Admission or Placement Determinations Based on Sex in Facilities Under Community Planning and Development Housing Programs."" We urge that this proposed rule change be withdrawn in its entirety.
NYSCADV was established 40 years ago as a statewide non-profit membership organization comprised of local domestic violence service providers and allied organizations that are committed to preventing and ending domestic violence. NYSCADV is designated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as the information clearinghouse, primary point of contact and resource center on domestic violence for the State of New York. NYSCADV is responsible for supporting the development of policies, protocols and procedures to enhance domestic violence intervention and prevention and also provides education and technical assistance to the network of primary-purpose domestic violence service providers statewide.
Since our inception, a primary focus of our work supports New York's local domestic violence service providers in the provision of trauma-informed, survivor-centered domestic violence services. NYSCADV has been engaged in a multi-year comprehensive umbrella project that supports local domestic violence service providers in their ongoing efforts to ensure that the services they provide meet the unique needs of all individuals and families who have been victimized by an abuser. This certainly includes efforts to ensure the accessibility of services to transgender individuals, a majority of whom experience some form of domestic violence during their lifetime. In fact, according to the 2015 National Transgender Discrimination Survey, more than half (54%) of respondents reported some form of intimate partner violence, and 47% had been sexually assaulted at some point in their lifetime./1
Federal and state government agencies and elected officials should be working in partnership with domestic violence advocacy organizations, victim services organizations, domestic violence survivors, transgender advocates, and other stakeholders to enhance the accessibility and availability of services for the transgender community, not restricting access and making it harder for transgender individuals to seek help. But HUD's proposal to amend the Equal Access Rule does the exact opposite. It seeks to roll back life-saving protections for transgender people seeking shelter. The New York State Coalition Against Domestic Violence and our member programs across New York State oppose any discriminatory barriers to services for transgender individuals and others.
New York State has taken great strides in protecting transgender individuals and others from all forms of discrimination. In October 2015, New York State became the first state in the nation to issue statewide regulations prohibiting harassment and discrimination on the basis of gender identity, transgender status or gender dysphoria. The regulations affirm that transgender individuals are protected under the State's Human Rights Law. As such, discrimination against transgender persons in New York State by housing providers, businesses, creditors and others is unlawful. Further, in 2019, Governor Andrew Cuomo signed into law the Gender Expression Non-Discrimination Act (GENDA) which added gender identity and gender expression to the state's human rights and hate crimes laws as protected classes, bans discrimination in employment, housing and public accommodations based on gender identity and gender expression, and provides enhanced penalties for bias-motivated crimes.
NYSCADV will continue advocating for the rights of transgender individuals in New York State and beyond. To that end, these comments reflect our commitment to ensuring that every survivor has access to shelter during a time of crisis, and from the deep knowledge from decades of experience that perpetuating discriminatory policies against any group or identity does not increase safety in shelter programs.
We urge the withdrawal of the rule.
Sincerely,
Connie Neal
Executive Director

Tanaka not sure he'll be ready for first week",FALSE,"Masahiro Tanaka is being cautious. The Yankees right hander said he would like to be ready for the opening week of the coronavirus-shortened MLB regular season. After taking a Giancarlo Stanton line drive off the top right-side of his head and suffering a mild concussion on July 4, it seems unlikely. 
""I'm not sure. ... I want to be optimistic and say yes. But obviously, the injuries, the injury is at the head,"" Tanaka said Tuesday through interpreter Shingo Horie. ""So, I think it's something that I need to be cautious about and, kind of, take it careful, more so than other injuries. So, as of now, I think it's just a step by step process. And that's all I can say for now.""
This whole strange season is about being cautious, particularly for the Japanese star, who fled Florida for his home country after baseball was shut down. At the time, via social media posts, Tanaka said that he was heading to Japan out of concern for his family and the spreading virus. He also indicated that there may have been another issue regarding his family's safety in the US during the pandemic. 
Tanaka declined to elaborate on what some translations of his social media posts called ""an incident,"" that created that fear for his safety. 
""I don't think I want to necessarily go into details about that. At this point. I think I said what I wanted to say through some social media at that time. It was more of like I said earlier: Considering what's best, always best for the family,"" Tanaka said. ""Obviously, there were some incidents, but someone had to make the decision of what we were going to do. And just considering everything, I thought that going back to Japan would make the most sense for our family. So that was the decision behind that.""
Since the coronavirus pandemic, which health experts believe originated in Wuhan, China, has hit our shores, a wave of anti-Asian hate crimes have been documented by law enforcement and activist organizations. In New York City alone, the NYPD has recorded 16 anti-Asian hate crimes which they connect to the pandemic. Asian Americans in New York have been kicked, pushed, assaulted and accosted on subways in emotional confrontations about COVID-19. 
The coronavirus pandemic has continued to ravage the U.S. On Tuesday 3.4 million cases of COVID-19 had been confirmed with over 138,000 Americans killed.
Japan, on the other hand, had a remarkably low death rate from the virus. The island nation was able to lift its COVID-19 national emergency restrictions back in May. 
So it was only after hard thought that Tanaka returned to New York to play in this season, which could be his last with the Yankees. 
""I did think it through. It wasn't like an instant, easy decision,"" Tanaka said. ""But I've decided to come back here and play. And now that I've made that decision, you know, I'm going to give it my best and give my hundred percent.""
Tanaka was the first pitcher to take the mound for live batting practice when the spring training reboot started. The third batter he faced was Stanton, who hit a 112 mile per hour line drive just above Tanaka's right temple. 
""It's a very unfortunate event, but I feel like I got very fortunate. I feel very lucky. Because it could have been something that's much worse,"" Tanaka said. ""Right now I have no symptoms at all. I'm able to get back, you know, in all the training menus and all that. So, yeah, I think I feel very fortunate in a very unfortunate event.""
Tanaka was diagnosed with a mild concussion, but said he has had no symptoms since being released from the hospital. He has been throwing on flat ground and doing workouts without issue and the next hurdle would be for him to throw a bullpen off the mound. Both Aaron Boone and Tanaka were very vague about when that might happen. 
""No details or any schedule, as of now, obviously the next step for me is to get on the mound for a side for a bullpen. I think we're taking the necessary steps to get there,"" Tanaka said. ""This whole thing is kind of a day-by-day process. But hopefully, I'm able to get back on the mound sooner rather than later and compete there."""

The antisemitic and racist graffiti was found after a resident who was cycling with his children discovered statements written in chalk on a sidewalk, which included lines such as ""Ann (sic) Frank should have worn a TAC mask,"" and the word ""Nigeria"" with the drawing of a penis. Black Lives Matter (BLM) signs were also stolen from a local church. 
 Police responded to calls from the local Presbyterian Church of Mount Kisco, where the BLM signs were stolen to investigate the incident. The case also comes following another incident earlier that month in which a BLM banner hung by the Chappaqua Quakers was set ablaze and vandalized. 
In response to the latest incident, the town's official Facebook page issued a statement, saying ""While it pains us to continue to report on these hate crimes, and we fear giving them oxygen, we will not allow antisemitic and racist incidents in our community to be swept under the rug or covered up."" 
""Not only will we continue to say 'Hate Has No Home Here,' 'Love thy Neighbor,' 'Black Lives Matter,' and 'All are Welcome Here,' but we will back up our words with actions.

[Update: Two people were charged with a hate crime in connection with the vandalism.] 
The police in Martinez, Calif., said on Sunday that they were seeking two white people who were seen vandalizing a Black Lives Matter mural less than an hour after it was painted in front of a local courthouse on Saturday.
“The community spent a considerable amount of time putting the mural together only to have it painted over in a hateful and senseless manner,” Chief Manjit Sappal of the Martinez Police Department said in a statement. “The city of Martinez values tolerance, and the damage to the mural was divisive and hurtful.”
Videos posted on social media show a white woman using a roller with black paint to cover the letters B and L in “Black Lives Matter,” while a white man records onlookers yelling for them to stop.
The mural, in yellow paint in the middle of a city street, spelled out “Black Lives Matter” in capital letters.
The man, who can be seen in a video wearing a red cap and a red shirt that reads “Trump” and “Four More Years,” can be heard saying: “We’re sick of this narrative” and “The narrative of police brutality, the narrative of oppression, the narrative of racism. It’s a lie. It’s a lie.”
The man was also recorded going to a car parked nearby to retrieve a can of black paint.
The woman, using two expletives, tells onlookers to “keep this” in New York, adding, “This is not happening in my town.”
At one point, the man in the red shirt tells onlookers: “Keep America great again, that’s right. Why don’t you guys learn about history, the Emancipation Proclamation Act?” and “You’re only free because of our forefathers.”
A woman can be heard off-camera telling the man he is not “from America” and that he is a “colonizer.”
“Your ancestors aren’t from here,” she says.
“You don’t know nothing,” the man in the red shirt replies.
That woman eventually takes the can of black paint from them.
The relationship between the two people who were seen defacing the mural was unknown, and it was unclear what charges they could face. Police officials were not immediately available to comment on Sunday night.
Justin Gomez, a local resident who got permission from the city to paint the mural, said of the vandalism on Sunday: “I’m not so surprised that it happened. I’m surprised at how bold they chose to be.”
The mural was painted on a one-block stretch of Court Street in Martinez, which is about 35 miles northeast of San Francisco. The city selected the location after Mr. Gomez, the lead organizer for Martizians for Black Lives, asked the city for permission to paint the message, he said.
“We asked to do it on our city’s main street,” Mr. Gomez said. The city, he said, offered the street in front of the Wakefield Taylor Courthouse instead.
“We immediately agreed to it,” he said, “and I feel it was a more powerful statement than what we had initially proposed.” 
Mr. Gomez and local residents started painting the mural at 7 a.m. on Saturday; by 2:30 p.m., with the paint still drying, he left.
By 3 p.m., Mr. Gomez said, he received messages saying the mural was being vandalized.
Mr. Gomez said that the mural had since been restored and that supporters were “maintaining a presence” to prevent further damage.
Similar murals have been painted in cities across the country, including Washington, New York, Dallas and Los Angeles.

A Chinese student at Fordham University is reportedly preparing to sue the New York School after the college demanded an apology for an Instagram post showing the student holding an AR-15 to show solidarity with the Tiananmen Square massacre anniversary.
Austin Tong, a Chinese immigrant, has been barred from the university campus and is required to do mandatory “implicit bias” training, the Washington Free Beacon reported. Administrators also demanded the student write a letter of apology as a consequence of his June 4 Instagram post, according to a disciplinary letter.
Tong held an AR-15 with the caption “Don't tread on me #198964” - a reference to the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989, in which communist Chinese authorities killed and arrested thousands who advocated for freedom from the state.

 A post shared by Austin Tong (@comrademeow) on Jun 4, 2020 at 2:38pm PDT
A refusal to apologize could mean expulsion from the New York college, according to the letter. Tong is instead preparing to sue the university, according to the Beacon.
“For a mere $50,000 a year in tuition, Fordham has smeared our client's reputation and permanently damaged his career prospects,” Tong's lawyer, Brett Josphe told the Free Beacon. “This behavior by the school and its officials shocks the conscience and there should be a heavy price to pay.”
Tong told the Free Beacon: “I will not apologize. I did nothing wrong and they did everything wrong. [Fordham is] a total disgrace.”
“I will not apologize, whatever consequence there may be,” he continued. “I don't think I'll even be able to finish college. This is a total bet on my part, but we'll see what happens.”
University officials showed up to the student's doorstep around 10 p.m. on the day of the post to inform him of his apparent conduct violation, according to the Beacon. The university accused him of a hate crime and “threats/intimidation,” according to the letter.

And in this case, rioters were rioting against the one state sanctioned force that could stop these exact sort of riots that people hate.Meanwhile, support for policies specifically protecting police officers has risen in the wake of this violence.According toRasmussen Reports[2]:Most voters believe there is a war on police in America today and want to make attacks on cops punishable as a hate crime. Blacks worry most that these attacks will make their communities less safe.Fifty-nine percent (59%) of Likely U.S. Voters think there is a war on police going on. 
That's up from 43% two years ago and up from a previous high of 58% in 2015.Fifty-nine percent (59%) also support the adoption of a Blue Lives Matter law in their state that would make attacks on police and first responders a hate crime and increase the penalties for such attacks. That's unchanged from 2016 when Louisiana became the first of more than a dozen states to adopt such a law.Sixty-eight percent (68%) of voters are concerned that deadly attacks on the police will lead to a shortage of police officers and reduce public safety where they live, with 44% who are Very Concerned. Whites (63%) are bigger supporters of Blue Lives Matter laws than blacks (52%) and other minority voters (49%). But blacks (84%) are a lot more concerned than whites (66%) and other minorities (70%) about a potential shortage of police officers in their community.According to past research fromRasmussen[3], defund the police is a fringe position that just two in ten believe in, which is down from when rioting began.66% of American Adults now oppose reducing the police budget in the community where they live to channel that money into more social services. That's up from 59% in early June when we first asked this question.Just 23% favor defunding the cops where they live, down from 27% in the previous survey. Eleven percent (11%) are undecided.Calls for defunding the police are being aggressively championed by the Black Lives Matter movement, but even among black Americans, 57% are opposed to defunding the police in their home community. Sixty-nine percent (69%) of whites and 62% of other minority adults share that view.Sixty-one percent (61%) of all Americans believe that violent crime is likely to go up in communities that defund the police. Only 12% think violent crime is more likely to go down, while 20% predict it will remain about the same....I have always seen the anti-police movement as unrealistic. It di no0t take long for Minneapolis to see an increase in crime when they reduced their police fore and defunded some of it. New York has also seen an increase in crime. Biden has already started backtracking on his ""reassigning"" of police funding.

Patrons tired of police harassment and shakedowns of their neighborhood gay bar fought back against police. Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera led the resistance over three nights of protest, resisting arrest and fighting back to reclaim their neighborhood gay bar, their safe space, and their civil rights. Pride was gifted to us by drag queens, trans women of color, and revolutionary spirit. 
Each year, we celebrate the anniversary of this riot and the movement it birthed. This year, we vow to better honor our intersectionality with, and debt to, the Black community by protesting, advocating, educating ourselves and others, and most importantly exercising our voting rights.This month and this day, June 26, contain many other anniversaries. Today marks the fifth anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision of Obergefell v. Hodges, which at long last legalized same-sex marriage in the United States. It is also the seventh anniversary of United States v. Windsor, which struck down the Defense of Marriage Act denying federal recognition to same-sex marriages. Today is the seventeenth anniversary of Lawrence v. Texas, which held that U.S. laws prohibiting private same-sex sexual activity between consenting adults are unconstitutional. June also marks the anniversary of Loving v. Virginia, which in 1967 struck down laws banning interracial marriages. The precedent of Loving was key to the decision in Obergefell.Earlier this month, in Bostock v. Clayton County, the Supreme Court gave us a new anniversary to celebrate in June. The highest Court in this country held that Title VII protects workers from being discriminated against for being gay or transgender. No longer can workers in 22 states get legally married to their same-sex spouse on a Tuesday and fired the next day for putting the wedding photo on their work desk. Each of these decisions is monumental, and each is amplified by virtue of being decided during Pride Month.This Pride Month also celebrates a first, as Mondaire Jones and Ritchie Torres make history as the first out Black Gay man and first African-Latinx Gay man to likely serve in the U.S. Congress. Both have insurmountable leads after this Tuesday's New York primaries.While these decisions are joyful, affirming, and important, our work is unfinished. In the words of Marsha P. Johnson, 'You never completely have your rights, one person, until you all have your rights.' No federal law prevents housing discrimination against LGBTQIA+ people. Thirty states still allow the damaging and hurtful practice of 'conversion therapy.' Thirty-seven states have not banned insurance exclusions for transgender health care. In the midst of Pride Month, the Trump Administration is trying to strip the anti-discrimination provisions of the Affordable Care Act from LGBTQIA+ people. Four states have no laws about hate crimes. Fifteen more have hate crime laws that fail to address gender identity or sexual orientation. LGBTQIA+ youth remain rejected by their families and comprise over 40% of homeless teens, the number for LGBTQIA+ youth of color is even higher.Today in America, trans folx—and particularly trans women of color—still face disproportionate violence at the hands of racists and homophobes. We remember and honor this year's victims: Riah Milton, Dominique 'Rem'mie' Fells, Tony McDade, Helle Jae O'Regan, Nina Pop, Penelope Daz Ramrez, Layla Pelaez Snchez, Selena Angelique Velzquez Ramos, Johanna Metzger, Lexi, Monika Diamond, Yampi Mndez Arocho, Neulisa Alexa Luciano Ruiz, Tete Gulley, Selena Reyes-Hernandez, and Dustin Parker.As protestors have been heard chanting across the nation, silence is violence. Schwabe stands in solidarity with the LGBTQIA+ community—each and every member. Black Lives Matter. Black Trans Lives Matter.Let this Pride Month be your call to action.To learn more about the history of Pride Month and the movement to end discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, please visit: The Human Rights Campaign[1] Lambda Legal[2] The Trevor Project[3] (resource on LGBTQIA+ homeless youth) The Marsha P.

The news comes as Smollett continues to face legal charges over allegations that he staged a hate crime against himself in 2019.
Last month, Smollett and his legal team requested that the charges -to which he pleaded not guilty -be dropped, but the request was turned down by a judge.
 B-Boy Blues is set to begin production on 17 October in New York City.
Hardy's novel, published in 1994, tells the story of a love affair between a journalist and a bike messenger, both of whom are black men.
Smollett, who was a regular on the Fox musical drama Empirebefore leaving the show in early 2019, has previously directed two episodes of the series, along with several music videos.
In January 2019, Smollett reported an alleged attack in Chicago, claiming that two men wearing masks had assaulted him and placed a noose around his neck.
He was initially charged with disorderly conduct when it was alleged that he had staged the incident himself. These charges were soon dropped.
However, in February of this year, Smollett was handed new charges, which amounted to six counts of filing false police reports.
He has always denied the charges and, in September, appeared in an Instagram Live video in which he maintained his innocence.

Today, the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) is launching its final video in a weekly series on Trump’s failure to keep LGBTQ people safe. Today’s installment highlights hate and anti-LGBTQ policies fueled by the Trump campaign and later the administration, threatening the safety and security of so many LGBTQ students. The video features Tuscon, Arizona mom Deborah Fernandez-Turner and her transgender child Ari, who talk about what the Trump administration’s rhetoric and actions have done to threaten Ari’s sense of safety at school.
“The safety and security of all students should be a top priority for any administration, but under Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and the Trump administration, the rollback of protections for LGBTQ people — especially protections for transgender students — has been unprecedented. In order to learn and develop, students must feel safe and welcome. Between an uptick in hate crimes, discriminatory policies, and a refusal to simply acknowledge the pain of and hate perpetrated against LGBTQ people, the Trump administration has failed to keep this community safe.

Smollett, who was fired from Fox TV show Empire after being accused of staging a hate crime against himself in early 2019, has repeatedly maintained his innocence and, in a new motion filed by his legal team, argues his second indictment is invalid.
In the motion, filed on 9 September and released on Tuesday (22Sep20), Smollettâ(EURO)(TM)s legal team argues the indictment was based on â(EURO)oeillegal and incompetent evidenceâ(EURO) gathered from Abel and Ola Osundairo during the initial investigation into Smollett, which was later ruled invalid.
The Osundairo brothers have long claimed they were paid by the actor to stage a hate crime against him because he was unhappy with his salary on the show.
He was indicted on 16 felony counts in March, including one for allegedly filing a false police report.
While criminal charges for disorderly conduct related to the hoax report allegations were dropped, six new felony counts were filed in February (20), after the special prosecutor was appointed to re-investigate the case.
However, it turns out the grand jury relied on testimony transcripts taken from the Osundairo brothers on 20 February, 2019 - which was previously invalidated by Judge Michael Toomin, Smollettâ(EURO)(TM)s lawyers argued.
â(EURO)oeThe OSP cannot have it both ways. It cannot convene a special grand jury based on Judge Toominâ(EURO)(TM)s Order but then rely on the transcripts from those â(EURO)~voidâ(EURO)(TM) proceedings to secure a new indictment,â(EURO) the motion states, reported the New York Post's gossip column Page Six.
""Based on the record available to the defense, the grand jurors were not aware that they could subpoena and question the Osundairo brothers instead of relying on their one-sided testimony presented by the OSP from proceedings which have been invalidated by the court,"" it adds.
â(EURO)oeThe OSPâ(EURO)(TM)s failure to inform the special grand jury at the commencement of the proceedings, before each witness testified, and before a true bill was requested, misled the grand jury and deprived Mr. Smollett of his right to the due process of law.â(EURO)

Heezy Yang, before coronavirus, do you think things were getting easier? When you talk about Pride gatherings and parades in Seoul, for example, was that possible, were those gatherings getting bigger before the virus? In general, things seemed to be going well, and going towards the right direction because Seoul Pride had been going to the festival for about 10 years now, and the first time I went there, the size of it was approximately 2,000 or 3,000 people but last year, they had over 120,000 people so the size of it has become really big, in general, and mainstream media, and K-pop even included, not, like, very out and loud more queer and LGBTQ factors and culture little by little, so things seemed to be going to the right direction but then this one outbreak happened and people had to face, they had to face the fact that things weren't actually as good as they seemed or there have always been problems.

I politely asked him for some space to which he responded, ""What did you say to me, chink?"" And proceeded to cut in front of me. At this point, I was already anticipating an increase in hate crimes against Asian-Americans to a Chinese virus about four days prior to my incident but I wanted to believe my experience was kind of an isolated incident since I live in such a racially and culturally diverse city like New York City.

Leader, Prosecutors Say",FALSE,"Harry H. Rogers drove into a group of demonstrators near Richmond, Va., on Sunday, the authorities said. The county prosecutor called him “an admitted leader of the Ku Klux Klan.”
A man drove a vehicle into a group of protesters outside Richmond, Va., on Sunday, the authorities said, and identified himself as a leader of the Ku Klux Klan. Prosecutors said they were investigating the episode as a possible hate crime.
The Henrico County Police Division said it received a call about the episode, which happened in Lakeside, just north of Richmond, shortly before 6. p.m.
“Several witnesses reported that a vehicle revved their engine and drove through the protesters occupying the roadway,” the police said in a statement. The driver, Harry H. Rogers, 36, of Hanover County, Va., was arrested and charged with assault and battery, the police said.
Across the United States, people have been gathering to protest police brutality after George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man from Minneapolis, died after a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck for nearly nine minutes.
There were no reports of serious injuries after the episode in Lakeside on Sunday, and the person who called the police was checked by emergency responders at the scene and refused further medical treatment, the police said.
A lawyer for Mr. Rogers could not immediately be reached for comment on Monday afternoon. It was unclear whether Mr. Rogers’s claims about his membership in the Ku Klux Klan were true. He is currently being held without bond.
“The accused, by his own admission and by a cursory glance at social media, is an admitted leader of the Ku Klux Klan and a propagandist for Confederate ideology,” said Shannon L. Taylor, the Commonwealth’s Attorney for Henrico County. “We are investigating whether hate crimes charges are appropriate.”
Studies indicate that membership in the Ku Klux Klan has been declining for decades, but that the overall number of hate groups in the United States has been growing in recent years. A report from the Southern Poverty Law Center found that the number of white supremacist groups has been rising since 2017, and data from the Anti-Defamation League shows that the use of white supremacist propaganda is growing across the country.
In a separate episode in Seattle on Sunday night, a man with a pistol drove a car through a crowd of protesters, the authorities said. Video footage from the scene showed a car moving on a crowded street toward an intersection where protesters were gathered near a Seattle Police Department station house in the city’s Capitol Hill neighborhood.
The reports from Seattle and Henrico County echoed a deadly episode in Charlottesville, Va., nearly three years ago, when a man plowed his car into a crowd of demonstrators protesting a white-supremacist rally, killing one woman and injuring at least 19 other people.
“Protesters acting peaceably, well within their constitutional rights of assembly, should not have to fear violence,” Ms. Taylor said. “We lived through this in Virginia in Charlottesville in 2017. I promise Henricoans that this egregious criminal act will not go unpunished. Hate has no place here under my watch.”

Truly shameful.pic .twitter.com/rBFzlg2WFu[3]; — Students For Trump (@TrumpStudents) August 21, 2020[4]Olivia Winslow and Camryn Amy, both 21, were indicted by a grand jury Tuesday on felony charges of robbery, conspiracy and hate crimes, as well as a misdemeanor charge of endangering the welfare of a child. Amy also was indicted on misdemeanor charges of assaulting a man who tried to recover the cap, attempting to assault the boy's mom and offensive touching of the child. The women are accused of committing the crimes 'for the purpose of interfering with the victim's free exercise or enjoyment of any right, privilege or immunity protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, or committed said crime because the victim had exercised or enjoyed said right or rights,' according to the indictment. 'Violence in any form is unacceptable, but harming another person - let alone a child - because of the expression of their views betrays the principles on which our country was founded,' said Delaware Attorney General Kathleen Jennings, a Democrat who has joined multiple lawsuits against the Trump administration. 'Free speech, free assembly, and free expression are sacred, no matter whether we agree with the opinions expressed, and especially when we don't,' Jennings added in a statement. Olivia Winslow and Camryn Amy: Wilmington Police The incident — which was captured on video that went viral — occurred outside a restaurant at the Wilmington Riverfront on Aug. 20, a few hundred feet from where Joe Biden gave his DNC acceptance speech.[5] The footage shows the two women damaging signs supporting Trump and taking a red MAGA cap. 'Get it Liv, get it,' Amy tells Winslow, who picks up the cap from the ground and tosses it. The boy chases after the women, saying, 'That's somebody else's hat,' before Amy picks it up again and walks away with it. 'Mom, call 911,' the boy says. The clip later shows Amy apparently slugging a man who tried to get the cap back before she throws it over a fence. Amy then approaches and confronts the woman shooting the video.

The man has been identified by police and local media as James Blight. Local Florida television network Spectrum Bay News 9 reported that Blight allegedly tore down Biden signs and also knocked over a speed limit sign with the bulldozer. Some local residents have described the incident as a ""hate crime,"" due to the demographics of the neighborhood.
Police have said that Blight claimed to be drunk and said he does not remember the incident. Newsweek reached out to Haines City Police Chief James Elensky for further comment, but he did not immediately respond.
""To come into our community and destroy property—it speaks to the dog whistles that Donald Trump has been putting out his whole campaign. 'Stand back and stand by' and we have guys in bulldozers doing this. What does the president have to say about that?"" former Vice Mayor Adam Burgess told Spectrum Bay News 9.
""There needs to be more punishment,"" Burgess said. ""This was a hate crime.""
Haines City, with a population of just over 13,000, is located in Polk County. In 2016, the county went for President Donald Trump by a wide margin of about 14 percentage points. Former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton won just 41.3 percent of the county's votes while Trump garnered 55.4 percent.
The state of Florida, where Trump officially transferred his residency in late 2019, went for Florida by a relatively narrow margin of 1.2 percentage points in the last presidential election. In 2008 and 2012, the southern state went for former Democratic President Barack Obama. The current Real Clear Politics average of Florida polls suggests Biden is narrowly favored to win the state—leading Trump by a small margin of 1.5 percentage points.
With tensions high ahead of Election Day on November 3—amid what is widely viewed as an exceptionally divisive campaign season—there have been numerous reports of Biden and Trump signs being stolen or vandalized in cities and towns across the country.
New York State Police reported last week that they had arrested 19-year-old Olivia Cinquinio of Amherst for allegedly stealing ""multiple"" campaign signs supporting Trump. Cinquinio confessed to the crime of petit larceny.
Earlier this month, a man in Trenton, Michigan, reported to police that his vehicle had been vandalized and that three of his Trump signs had been stolen from his yard, The News Herald reported. And Jacksonville, Florida, resident Myra Rubinstein told CBS News affiliate WJAX-TV in mid-October that she put up a Biden campaign sign and it was stolen the next day.

We hope you'll join us then. Tucker Carlson is coming up next from Washington. Good night, everybody.
TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.
We've spent an awful lot of time over the past few weeks trying to figure out and then explain what's happening to our country. At times, it's been depressing, but it seems important.
At this point, it is pretty clear that nothing is what we're told it is. These are not protests. This is not about George Floyd. It's not about systemic racism, whatever that is. America is not a racist country. You are not a bad person for living here.
These are definitely not protesters. They're not even rioters. They're the armed militia of the Democratic Party. They're working to overthrow our system of government. They're trying to put themselves in power.
That's all obvious now. It's genuinely sinister. We're worried about it. We've said that. We mean it.
But in the process of saying that, we may have missed something else that is also true as well as highly amusing. These people are idiots -- for real.
The angry children you watched set fire to Wendy's and toppled statues and scream at you on television day after day are truly and utterly stupid.
There's probably never been a dumber group gathered in one place in all of American history. They are mouth breathers. They know nothing. They couldn't tell you who George Washington was. They don't know when the Civil War was fought, probably not even to the century.
They say they oppose racism, and then they rip down monuments to abolitionists. They don't see the contradiction in that because they have no idea who the abolitionists were. They think it's a band from the 80s.
A lot of the very stupidest people, by the way, are quote, ""well educated."" They have all the worthless credentials we are told we should want for our children. They went to Duke. They work at some nonprofit. They hold a good paying job in digital marketing at Nike.
Yes, they're supposedly impressive, but they're not impressive at all. They're incredibly dumb. They fall for any lie, no matter how preposterous. The more preposterous, the more likely they are to fall for it.
And like small children, they're afraid of everything.
In California, a Hispanic utilities worker made the mistake of cracking his knuckles at a red light. The geniuses thought he was flashing a white supremacist gang sign, so they fired him. Poor guy.
In Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf who claims she went to college and law school -- wow -- mistook exercise equipment in a park for Ku Klux Klan nooses. Schaaf then held a press conference to hyperventilate about hate crimes.
Talk about textbook hysteria, but it was also hysterically funny.
For people this neurotic, life is one long horror movie. They squirm in their seats paralyzed by fear. Even the simplest and most obvious decisions become impossible to make. They're too afraid.
""The New York Times"" has profiled a group of people just like this, sympathetically, of course. This group lives in an affluent part of Minneapolis.
After watching hours of CNN, they pledged to stop calling the police. Calling the police, they decided was racist, so they didn't call police.
Almost immediately, hundreds of mentally ill homeless drug addict showed up and erected a tent camp in their park. Then prostitutes arrived. Then caravans of drug dealers showed up to service the addicts. People overdosed.
Meanwhile, neighbors cowered in their own homes unable to sleep. One resident, a man called Mitchell Erickson, found himself cornered by two thugs who put a gun into his stomach and demanded his car keys. So, Erickson finally broke down. He called police. And then he deeply regretted it, quote, ""I put those boys in danger of death by calling the cops,"" Erickson told the paper, apparently not joking.
For the rest of us, the question is, can people this damaged, this weak actually run a country? And the answer is no, of course not. And we definitely should not let them.
But in the meantime, we also should not pass up an opportunity to let them amuse us, because they do. And for that, we're joined tonight by our old friend, Mark Steyn.
Mark, it's great to see you tonight. Have you ever -- and you're a watcher of the passing parade and have been for decades -- have you ever seen a group of people this abjectly stupid?
MARK STEYN, AUTHOR AND COLUMNIST: No, and it's interesting, Tucker. There have been revolutions throughout history in which very evil persons have participated, but I'm not sure the march of the morons isn't actually more dangerous, because what happens, so you can be entirely arbitrary. You might just have too big a bow on your hair ribbon and it gets mistaken for a noose as happened a couple of years ago at, I think, it was the University of Wisconsin.
The President of that college rebuked two ladies who had gone and gotten a facial at a spa and then posted pictures of themselves in all of that gunk and goo and she had mistaken it for blackface and launched a full inquiry.
So, going and getting some exfoliating seaweed wrap can expose you if it's not racial discrimination, it is facial discrimination. And we know all of these people in seaweed wraps are just one step away from breaking out into a whole medley of mammy songs.
This is a lunatic, an actual march of the morons from coast to coast. It's actually tragic. What it is, I think, is a kind of civilizational regime change because when you actually tear people away, uproot them from their entire civilizational inheritance and they're completely unmoored, have nothing to cling to, are rooted in nothing, and so destroying this poor old Norwegian abolitionist's statue seems entirely reasonable to them.
CARLSON: I think that's exactly right. And it is a cliche, but in this case it's so true. The most fanatical, the most brainwashed, the dumbest in other words of these mobs tend to be the ones who went to Brown and Wesleyan and Duke. Duke. Why is that? I never see any HVAC repairman pulling statues down.
STEYN: Well, I think we have -- I think we live in an age of stupid elites. I mean, this is the kind of leisurely varsity six and a half years to finish a Bachelor's Degree in transgender in colonialism studies, but in the 19th Century, you would have to have been the seventh son of a minor European Grand Duke to enjoy.
And now, people have expanded it so that the upper middle class go to university essentially to learn the correct attitudes, and by the correct attitudes, they mean entirely insane attitudes. This is essentially an elite revolt against the masses.
CARLSON: That is exactly right. So, let's think through where we're going. So if city leaders and Republicans on Capitol Hill are not willing to protect the monuments we have, the statues we have, obviously, we're going to have to move at some point the next debate, what should we replace the toppled statues with?
So we thought this through for a second and here's some suggestion or two.
So, Abraham Lincoln freeing a slave is now racist. Everyone on the left is telling us that. What if you replace that with another landmark moment in race relations, Joe Biden defeating corn pop?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOE BIDEN (D), PRESUMPTIVE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Corn pop was a bad dude, and he ran a bunch of bad boys, and he cut off his six-foot length of chain. He folded up and he said, you walk out with that chain and you walk down to the car and say you may cut me man, but I'm going to wrap this chain around your head. I said, are you kidding me? He said no, if you don't, don't come back and he was right. So, I walked out with the chain.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: You can just picture this, Joe Biden holding corn pop's chain aloft in victory, like a heavyweight champion, like the fist in Detroit. Or what about of Christopher Columbus, obviously no longer allowed, we need to replace him because ethnic categories matter now with another famous Italian. We're nominating tonight the creepy porn lawyer, Michael Avenatti.
Instead of celebrating Aventatti though, his statue could offer the rest of us a warning. He could carry a massive clock symbolizing -- and this is true for all of us -- his fleeting 15 minutes of fame, obviously worth building a statue like this in every American city, but we put it outside CNN first.
Those are our suggestions. You're more creative. Do you have any ideas?
STEYN: Well, I would like to see -- because I think it gets to the heart of this moment. I love the fake hate crimes, everyone loves a fake hate crime. They're fun for one and all.
I would love to see a massive statue of Jussie Smollett being beaten up by the two Nigerian brothers he hired when he went out to get a meatball Sub at 2:30 in the morning during a polar vortex. And I won't want any money spent on the meatball Subs. I want a huge meatball Sub with giant stones representing the meatballs swirling around in the polar vortex, as he is clubbed by the Nigerian brothers that he hired to do it. I'd love that.
I would also like -- by the way that Teddy Roosevelt one in New York. Teddy should be gone, the two other guys should be gone. Most of the horse should be gone, but they should leave the hind legs and the horse's butt on top of it to represent the silence of conservative institutions during this great assault on Western civilization.
CARLSON: The horse's ass statue.
STEYN: We don't need a new statue, just leave the hind legs and the horse's butt representing all the conservative institutions you've given money to for the last three decades for all the good they've done in this situation.
CARLSON: Here's to you AEI, a bronze horse's butt as you lecture America about its racism as its institutions collapse. Mark Steyn, that is the best idea I have heard all week. God bless you for coming on tonight. Thank you.
STEYN: Thanks. Thanks a lot, Tucker.
CARLSON: Well, the NASCAR noose incident was yet another fake hate crime. The question is who was more disappointed by the outcome? Bubba Wallace, the NASCAR driver or the media figures who jumped in to tell us this was the next turning point in the march towards Civil Rights? We will tell you next.
CARLSON: The noose you heard so much about hanging in NASCAR driver, Bubba Wallace's garage turned out to be what almost every other recent news turned out to be, not a noose at all. In fact, it was a rope used to pull down a garage door. And even after we discovered this, last night on CNN, Bubba Wallace tried to keep the outrage going.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: Have you seen ropes like that hanging from garages? Is that -- is that typical?
BUBBA WALLACE, NASCAR DRIVER: Don, the image that I have and I have seen of what was hanging in my garage is not a -- is not a garage tool. From the evidence that we have, that I have, it's a straight up noose.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: Yes, it wasn't a straight up news. It was a straight up garage door pull. And today, Wallace sort of admitted that. He said the noose wasn't what we feared it was. He may have been deeply disappointed to learn that, he can no longer pose as a victim, a millionaire racecar driver.
The press is deeply disappointed, too. CNN immediately repeats every bogus hate crime allegation as fact, even before the investigation is done. That's Jussie Smollett, the Covington High School kids, you name it. And of course this was no exception.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOHN KING, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: NASCAR investigating a shocking incident, a noose found in the garage of driver, Bubba Wallace.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It could have been one of their own who did something like this, and that is what's most concerning to officials here.
JIM SCIUTTO, CNN ANCHOR: This happens the year 2020, it is just beyond belief.
ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: The racism directed to a star of NASCAR who has been helping in the drive against hate and the use of the Confederate flag there. Tonight, the questions about how someone was able to get inside Bubba Wallace's garage stall to leave a noose.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: Yes. We get it. So most NASCAR fans probably are not going to vote for Joe Biden. So we must, under the cover of news, crush, demean them and then send the F.B.I. down, 15 agents to put the fear of God into these people. Why aren't you voting for Joe Biden?
They really went all in on this story. Less than an hour before it was exposed as fake, MSNBC was telling you that anyone who was skeptical of this at all wasn't just wrong, but morally depraved.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You have a conservative reaction to Bubba Wallace, which says, well, this is obviously fabricated, it's obviously fantasy. Tell me a little bit about what you think about that and whether the same way that I found the support and the solidarity so moving, I find the reaction incredibly infuriating.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We always have to convince a certain segment of the population, that the hell that we're catching is actually real. And the reason why we have to do that is because we have to confront this world of make believe, this willful ignorance --
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: This world of make belief. Projection anyone? By the way, MSNBC anchor, Al Sharpton tonight is still claiming that it is real.
Deroy Murdock is contributing editor to National Review online, a frequent guest on the show. Happy to have him again tonight. Deroy, good to see you. Watch it. Look --
DEROY MURDOCK, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Hi. Good to see you.
CARLSON: Obviously, it's easy to say you were wrong, you should admit it, apologize. But maybe we're being too literal. I mean, listening to some of this stuff, it really feels like Radio Rwanda. It feels like the media trying to gin up -- I'm serious, like, why are they doing -- why are they doing this? Why is it so important to prove that America is a bad place and that NASCAR fans are racist?
MURDOCK: Well, a couple of things. If you're terrible, I guess you could say that they're -- they have -- they suffer from what I call a rush to misjudgment. They see something like this and they immediately assume the worst rather than waiting for the F.B.I. or the police or anybody else to do any kind of investigation. So they just rush to these terrible conclusions.
The other is, as you suggest that they are so deeply embedded, and almost enthralled by the notion that America is a completely racist society that we're just moments away from the return of Jim Crow, that the Ku Klux Klan is around every corner, and that we need to demonstrate to people that this terrible, terrible, systemic institutionalized racism is just erupting all around us.
And yet, you find with one example after another, this one, Covington, Jussie Smollett, there was a case of a student at Bowling Green State who said that she believed there's a Ku Klux Klan meeting happening in a classroom because she saw a sort of a white sheet -- somebody under a white sheet.
Well, it turns out they looked into it. It was actually a piece of lab equipment with the protective cloth over it. And so time and time and time again, these awful terrible racist stories turn out to be completely flimsy or phony or totally nonexistent.
And unfortunately, a lot of people who seem to be very invested in wishing that they were true.
CARLSON: They're always aimed at a certain group. It's the Catholic school in Kentucky. It's NASCAR fans. I've lived in rich liberal neighborhoods a lot of my life. At the height of the COVID hysteria, all the liberals in my neighborhood were totally fine with their gardeners and housekeepers putting themselves at moral risk to come serve them. No one ever called that racist, I noticed. Nobody ever calls out Democratic voters for what actually might be racism. Why is that?
MURDOCK: Well, yes, you don't see that -- you have these people just assuming the worst about their fellow Americans, and what I find amazing about this and really, very heartwarming is what the reaction was to this Bubba Wallace situation.
Even if somebody had put a noose in his garage. Look what the response was. It wasn't the racist NASCAR drivers and the bigoted NASCAR owner saying all right, get the message, get the hell out of our all white-sport, but exactly the opposite happened.
The NASCAR officials denounced this. They said, we agree with Bubba Wallace, no more Confederate flags at NASCAR events. And they had this very moving event, I think it was on Sunday or Monday where they pushed his car along, the drivers, owners, other luminaries in NASCAR marched behind his car.
You had Richard Petty, age 82 come out of retirement to go up and hug Bubba Wallace. This would be roughly equivalent, not exactly the same, but roughly equivalent to Babe Ruth going up and hugging Jackie Robinson after he broke the color line in baseball back in 1948.
You didn't see a racist response, you saw a massive anti-racist response by essentially an overwhelmingly white, overwhelmingly Southern and probably very conservative group of people. And that's what we ought to celebrate.
I mean, I think that the -- is the glass half full or half empty on racism. I think we're down the less swig, the last few drops of racism and you have people on the left behaving as if the glass of water were Old Faithful, the big geyser just gushing all night and all day long.
CARLSON: Nicely put. These are people of goodwill and decency and the left uses their goodwill and decency against them, which is the saddest part of all.
MURDOCK: Absolutely.
CARLSON: Deroy Murdock. Great to see you tonight.
MURDOCK: And for all -- and to win elections. That's the worst part of it. To help Democrats get elected and that's why they are doing this.
CARLSON: That's right. That's exactly right. This is transactional. It's an election year. We should remember that. Good to see you.
MURDOCK: Exactly. Correct. That's it. Good to see you.
CARLSON: Well, one of our conservative judicial appointees, so many are conservative, John Roberts, for example, just delivered a ruling enshrining transgender rights at the Federal level. You never voted on that. We'll never have a national referendum on that. But it has a lot of effects.
For example, what does that mean for women who want to play sports against other women and not be beaten by biological males? It's a real question. If you have daughters, you know that. We'll explore it after the break.
CARLSON: We spent some time on this show looking into the very tough spot many female athletes find themselves in. Increasingly, they find themselves forced to compete at a great disadvantage with biological men.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: You were in a race, two biological males were allowed to compete and you didn't make it by two slots. Is that correct?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, it is. I came eighth place and the top six qualify for the Regional New England meet, and if those two athletes weren't competing, then I would have been the sixth girl and I would have moved on and advanced.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: The girl you just saw has, along with two other women sued for the right to compete in women's sports against other biological women. But they are amazingly fighting an uphill battle. The judge in that case, Robert Chatigny has banned the girls' attorneys from describing biologically male athletes trying to compete in women's sports as males. He has also refused to recuse himself because he just doesn't care.
There's another problem. A Supreme Court decision last week written by Justice Neil Gorsuch massively expanded the scope of Federal law regulating transgender issues. So the question is, and it's particularly acute if you have daughters is will women's sports exist?
Kristen Waggoner is the General Counsel and Senior VP of the U.S. Legal Division for Alliance Defending Freedom. We're happy to have her on tonight. Kristen, thanks for coming on. So, what does this mean exactly?
KRISTEN WAGGONER, GENERAL COUNSEL AND SENIOR VP, U.S. LEGAL DIVISION FOR ALLIANCE DEFENDING FREEDOM: Thank you. Well, our clients have lost opportunities, podium spots, metals and other types of opportunities, because the Connecticut schools have allowed two male athletes to take 15 different state championships away from nine girls.
So you're right that we're deeply concerned about this and concerned that the law reflects reality that biology matters and recognizing that is not bigotry.
CARLSON: And girls matter. I mean, that's what we're told. Girls matter. Women matter. Their voices matter. Their experience matters. Their achievements matter. I mean, that's beaten into our heads and by the way, I agree with it, but now, we're told, ""Shut up. They don't matter at all."" What is going on?
WAGGONER: Well, we have been told that by some, but that's why we're fighting this case. It is again to recognize that biology matters and that the law should reflect biological distinctions.
As an athlete, myself who played in college and a daughter, who I anticipate will, I agree it very much matters because we know that, first of all science and commonsense tells us that men, boys who reach puberty, no matter what kind of hormones or testosterone suppressants they have, girls will never be able to compete at that level.
An interesting fact that I read just today was that 275 high school boys are able to score a faster time against the best female Olympic sprinter. So, we know that these differences matter and that girls deserve an equal playing field.
CARLSON: So, it's interesting. It's not just that biological men are competing against women. It's that they are winning, and that's really the most unfair part of it, and winning on a wide scale, correct? This is not you know, something that's happened three times.
WAGGONER: You're absolutely right. It is happening in different -- all kinds of different segments of our society. But I would say, the low hanging fruit right now for activists on the left is the athletic field, and we need to make sure that we protect that field, not only for the benefits that athletes can have through scholarships and advancements and opportunities, but also just what being able to compete produces.
Ninety six percent of all women CEOs were athletes. This type of competition is good, and if we want to have true diversity in our society, we should recognize that in terms of recognizing the differences between men and women. Those are good things.
CARLSON: It's inherently healthy to be outside competing athletically. It's better than being on Snapchat even. I mean, I don't want to blow your mind or anything.
So, obviously the having spent a lot of time around female athletes myself, I know that girls are into it. I mean, they're into it. And if you take away their opportunities, if you cheat them out of their victories, it hurts them. Is anyone listening to them? To their voices in this?
WAGGONER: They are listening to them. And we've been excited about some of the opportunities that have developed. First, these girls were three lone girls standing alone. Their co-teammates felt the same way, but didn't have the courage to speak. Others have said, I agree, but I don't have the courage to speak.
But thankfully, in this particular case, the Department of Justice has come in and filed briefs on their behalf. We've had the Department of Education issue findings in their favor.
We even have radical feminists and lesbians who are speaking out on their behalf, including J.K. Rowling, who came out in the last couple of weeks and said, I know I'm going to take hits for this, but you know what, this is about being a woman and no matter how any man feels, that man is not a woman and certainly not when it comes to issues of safety, of privacy and of female competition.
CARLSON: That's exactly right. If progress means crushing little girls, that's not progress. Actually, it's bullying. It is cruelty. It is disgusting and no society can ignore nature forever. Sorry, you can't. Kristen, thanks so much for your bravery. I know you take a lot of abuse for it.
WAGGONER: Well, thank you. I appreciate yours as well, Tucker.
CARLSON: Thank you. Well, the bestselling book in the country right now, in case you haven't checked the rankings is not a spy thriller. It's not a young adult fantasy novel. It's a short political book. It's called ""White Fragility.""
Soon, it may be required reading at your children's school. It may be already. So what does it say? We read it and we have a report after the break.
CARLSON: The bestselling book in America last week wasn't anything by J.K. Rowling, it was a tract called ""White Fragility"" by Robin DiAngelo. It's a hit and not a small hit. ""White Fragility"" has sold so many copies of the paperback edition, it is out of stock on Amazon.
Schools and companies across the country are ordering it in bulk. Deloitte is pushing it, so is NBC and Harvard Business School. The CEO of American Airlines was recently photographed reading the book.
This fall, ""White Fragility"" is likely to be required reading at your children's school. You may soon be told to study it on a corporate retreat. So, it's worth knowing what it is. What's it about exactly?
We read the book and we'll sum it up for you in four words -- white people are racist. Not just racist white people, all white people, whether they're six years old or a hundred years old, all of them are by definition racist.
They are racist because they are white. Only white people are racist. No one else is. Robin DiAngelo tells people this for a living. She's a professional anti-racist educator. She shuttles between schools and boardrooms telling people that their DNA make them evil. She makes big money doing this.
Last year, for example, the University of Kentucky, a publicly funded University paid DiAngelo $12,000.00 for two hours of this message. The school could have used that money to give poor black kids an education, but instead they handed the cash. That's more than a third of what the average American makes in a year to a not very bright white lady to tell them they're racist. In other words, Robin DiAngelo has a very good gig.
Of course not everyone likes her message, telling people they're racist is fine, if they actually are racists. But what if they're not racists and most people in this country are not?
Well, let's see. How would you like it if someone called you a child molester or a wife beater? You probably wouldn't like it very much. In fact, you could lose your job for that. You'd lose your friends. You can even lose your family. You might feel pretty threatened by that accusation.
Aha says Robin DiAngelo. That means you're guilty of racism. Feeling threatened is definitive proof that you're a racist. You are defensive. You've got white fragility, hence the title of the book.
By the way, if you're not threatened when someone publicly denounces you as racist, that is also proof that you're a racist. Either way, my friend, you are a racist.
Logic is clearly not Robin DiAngelo's speciality, neither is literate writing or clear thinking. She is a complete and total idiot. That's one thing you learn by the end of her book. And yet our leaders treat Robin DiAngelo with great respect. They think she's a genius. That tells you everything about them, and also the moment we're living in, the dumbest people suddenly have the most power.
In the book, DiAngelo goes on to make a number of other ridiculously false claims, laughably false. Some of them are so obviously the opposite of what is actually true. You've got to imagine she was grinning as she typed the manuscript. Will they believe this? Yes.
In America, DiAngelo writes, quote, ""We are socially penalized for challenging racism."" Really? Where and how? The country the rest of us live in, the United States of America hates racism. Hating racism is effectively our national religion.
Every organization we have is organized to stamp it out. Commit racism and the F.B.I. shows up. Come on. It's just too absurd to be real.
But Robin DiAngelo isn't really trying to convince anyone. The real point of her book is to defeat and demoralize you. DiAngelo claims that everything you really want, everything that people of every color really want in every society in the world is a sign of white racism.
You want to live in a safe neighborhood, you're racist for that. You want to send your kids to a decent school, you're a racist for that. All of your dreams are racism. And the only way to atone for this racism is to give up those dreams, to abandon your aspirations and make sure that your family lives a much worse life.
For white people, DiAngelo writes, quote, "" ... discomfort is necessary and important."" Needless to say, DiAngelo does not address the millions of white people in this country who already live in perpetual discomfort because they are impoverished. She doesn't mention the entire counties in rural America where virtually no adult man has a full time job, where there no dentists because no one could afford to go to the dentist.
Robin DiAngelo has never met people like that. No doubt she would hate them if she did. Instead DiAngelo's book is effectively addressed to entitled urban professionals as silly and frivolous and self-loathing as she is -- her friends.
In DiAngelo's world, economics play no role in anything. They don't matter. Everyone she knows has a high status job and a secure job. They're not worried about unemployment. They don't care about income inequality. They're on the right side of it. These aren't problems for them.
Remember, DiAngelo herself gets paid $6,000.00 an hour to talk. She's not concerned about paying the rent. And in fact, DiAngelo explains at one point, worrying about economic injustice is just another symptom of -- brace yourself here -- racism, of white fragility.
Get it? Maybe you're starting to understand why Corporate America absolutely loves this book. Why? Because Robin DiAngelo absolves them of their crimes. Apple and the health insurers and the credit card companies get off scot-free because the real problem, Robin D'Angelo tells them is white racism and what a relief that is for them to learn.
$6,000.00 an hour is a small indulgence to pay for that kind of forgiveness. Thank you, Reverend DiAngelo, we appreciate the house call.
In sum, ""White Fragility"" is an utterly ridiculous book. Its ironies are so profound, they make your head spin, a book about racism that is far more aggressively racist than anything Louis Farrakhan has ever written. A book that claims to side with black people, but instead patronizes them and demeans them, like they are children. A book about systemic injustice that is, in fact itself a sly defense of the very people perpetuating the worst injustices in our society.
Everything about ""White Fragility"" is poisonous garbage and it's not an overstatement, and that will be obvious to you the second your kids bring it home from school, or the moment the corporate HR Director in your office lays a copy of it on your desk and you should say so when that happens. Don't be passive. Speak up loudly. It is your right to disagree with Robin DiAngelo.
What she says is wrong. It's crazy. It's destructive and it foments hatred.
We are Americans, we're allowed to do that. The second we are forced to accept the premises of white fragility, we won't be Americans.
By the way, the main reason that a crackpot race tract like ""White Fragility"" and many books like it spread so rapidly in this country is because of American higher education. It is filled with rot and that rot spreads.
Even now, our public K through 12 schools are woke propaganda mills promoting racial division and hatred of the country that makes them possible.
Tomorrow, we'll have a guest on to explain just how deep the rot has gone. Not a segment you want to miss.
Well, up next, for weeks, rioters have targeted and destroyed statues and public art, almost all of them have avoided any punishment at all. It's not because the law is on their side, it is not; in fact, there are many laws criminalizing what we're watching them do.
So why is the Department of Justice using laws to protect the country they're sworn to protect? Interesting question. That's next.
And then, also not a small story, breaking news tonight about UFOs in America, which appear to be real. Straight ahead.
CARLSON: The rioters currently destroying your cities don't care about the Civil War. They don't know when it took place. They don't care about racism. They don't care about George Floyd. What they hate is very clear. They hate your country. They hate its past, its people, its culture, everything about it. They want to destroy it and they want to put themselves in charge of it.
Last night in Madison, Wisconsin, rioters went on a rampage in the state capital. The spark for the riot was the arrest of the young man who entered a restaurant and began berating people and threatening them.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You hate that you're a racist. You hate that you're a racist. Why are you a racist? Why are you a racist?
[Bleep] the police department. They know what time it is. You know what mother [bleep] time it is.
My name is Yeshua Musa and I am [bleep] disturbing the [bleep] out of their restaurant.
And I've got a [bleep] bat.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: I've got an effing bat. You would have called the police, too, at minimum and of course, the mob would denounce you as racist for doing it, but who cares? This is crazy. You have a right to dinner without being threatened with violence. Right? Right.
Well, as they rampage, the mob then toppled the statue of a man called Hans Christian Heg. He was an immigrant and a die-hard abolitionist who in fact died fighting against the Confederacy. They didn't know that because they're morons. Their leaders don't care. They just hate the country.
The statue was ripped down any way and dumped into a lake. The real problem, of course, was that it represented the past. The mob then turned and assaulted a Democratic State Senator who was walking by.
[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]
CARLSON: Oh, they went too far. They assaulted a Democrat. Oh, that's allowed. These are armed militias. What are you doing, guys? Pull it back.
Wisconsin's Governor is about to punish the people behind that assault. Finally.
Radio show host Jason Rantz joins us to discuss this and the latest from the breakaway nation of CHOP. He is our CHOP correspondent. Jason, good to see you tonight.
So, it does seem all these things are going unpunished. The people who call the police are themselves punished for doing that. People who try to protect statues are threatened with arrest. But here, you have a mob, accidentally beats up a Democrat and by the way, I couldn't be more against that to be totally clear, but that's the -- that's bridge too far?
JASON RANTZ, SEATTLE RADIO SHOW HOST: It is weird because, I mean, when you think about what they decided to do in Wisconsin, it is so ironic. Number one, State Senator Tim Carpenter is gay. He is a progressive. This is someone who has spoken out on the side of peaceful protesters and then all of a sudden, you see that this is the guy that gets taken down.
And then as you point out, Hans Christian Heg, I mean, this is a guy who is an immigrant, who fought against slavery, and simply because he is part of the past, they decide to decapitate the statue and throw it in a lake.
What is especially alarming is when you talk to some of the folks who are behind some of this activism, number one, they either say it's old. It doesn't represent progress, we're going to take it down, or simply don't know.
They just view all of these statues without any kind of context, and so they are just told we're supposed to be angry at this stuff. That looks like a white dude in a statue. That clearly means white supremacy. Let's go ahead and take down the statue. It's absolutely absurd.
CARLSON: And at this point, I don't care whose statue it is of. The statue of Marion Barry in Washington, D.C. a terrible mayor. I would defend it because it's not up to a bunch of morons from Antifa what our public art looks like and what our monuments are. That's the voters' decision. I don't care who that guy was like. Like this is insanity.
So, what's happening in CHOP?
RANTZ: A hundred percent. Yes, so when it comes to CHOP, we're now at a point where we seem we believe to see a slowdown of the activism. There is a smaller group that's still there. They're choosing to hang out and still try to keep this East Precinct, this police station under their control.
At the same time, we're now hearing a separate group, that's sort of within CHOP that wants to go down and potentially take over the space now.
So, we may be having a conversation in the next coming days of those same groups trying to take over a tourist destination for Seattle, that to be fair right now, no one is actually using because of the coronavirus.
I mean, we just had a weekend full of violence of four people shot, one person dead, including, by the way, not only a 19-year-old who was murdered, but a 17-year-old who was shot in the arm and no one seems to want to talk to detectives about what's going on.
And ask yourself why that is, are these the peaceful protesters that people are pretending aren't actually violent? Or is there maybe -- just maybe progressives a part this movement that we should not be backing?
There seems to be this move to pretend that everyone who is out there is perfectly peaceful because they don't want the peaceful protesters to be defined by the chaos and the instigators. You're not doing yourself any favor.
I'm in favor of all of the peaceful protesters. I'm okay with that. I may disagree with what they're saying, but peacefully protesting -- that is your right. What's going on whether it's in Wisconsin or here in Washington State is just one step too far or 10 steps too far.
CARLSON: Yes. Well, they're not for peaceful protests. Really, really quickly. I don't know how many of our viewers have been to Seattle. It's one of the prettiest cities in the world and a lot of normal nice people live there. Are they leaving?
RANTZ: There are a lot of people who have decided not just to leave Seattle, in some cases, they're leaving the State of Washington. They look to Idaho and they say, okay, that's a place that's family friendly. It's clean, it's sane. Let's maybe go there and raise our family.
We're also hearing from businesses that are talking about leaving as well.
CARLSON: That's also so sad. Jason Rantz, it's great to see you.
RANTZ: Thank you.
CARLSON: As we noted before, in rising frustration and total bewilderment, Republicans on Capitol Hill have remained silent as mobs around the country desecrating our monuments and destroying our history.
Finally, that seems to be changing a little bit. Congressman Jim Banks of Indiana is writing a Bill to protect monuments to our founders. The Bank's Bill would make it a Federal crime to destroy or deface statues of the men who signed the Declaration of Independence, or any former President. Good for him.
What's distressing to learn is that Federal law already protects our war memorials. No one is enforcing that law. That's why so many monuments to our fallen soldiers have been vandalized. We shouldn't be surprised that the law is not enforced because there are dozens upon dozens of Federal laws against what the Democratic Party's militias are now doing to our country.
There are Federal statutes against arson and rioting and criminal conspiracy all the way up to laws against terrorism, which this definitely is.
But the Justice Department has decided to ignore all of these laws and leave them unenforced.
Instead, D.O.J. has spent its time dispatching 15 F.B.I. agents to Talladega to investigate yet another meaningless noose hoax. So, at least you know where they stand.
Well, this may be the strangest year in the lifetime of anyone still breathing, 2020, but it could get even stranger.
It turns out that chaos here on Earth has not brought an end to unusual sights above us in the sky.
Last week in California, an eyewitness observed about a hundred small white orbs hovering above. Were they balloons? Birds? Something more? We don't know. We might know more if we had more information from The Pentagon, they've been studying UFOs carefully for more than a decade.
But even now, they are keeping what they are finding to themselves and themselves only. There appears to be no systematic sharing of intelligence between The Pentagon and our Intelligence Agencies and that's very odd.
At least conceivably, UFOs may not be from space. No one at The Pentagon believes this. They think they are from space, but at least within the realm of possibility, they could be from China, or another one of this country's enemies, so we should find out.
This week the Senate Intelligence Committee took a step toward fixing that. They voted to require the Defense Department to compile and release a detailed report explaining everything it knows about unexplained aerial phenomena. We hope that happens. We have no faith that it actually will, but we are rooting for it.
And of course, if and when that report does come out, you will hear about it here first.
For many years, you've heard people say, oh, it's just UFO craziness. That was our position, too. But it's not all craziness. There are things we don't know and we also know that our authorities enthusiastically lie to us, so it's worth pressing them, because it's not a small thing.
We're out of time. Amazingly, we are about 15 seconds from turning the show over to -- and this is our nightly quiz game to whom? You guessed it, the Great Sean Hannity who is standing by live in New York."

U.S Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Rob Portman (R-OH), Gary Peters (D-MI), James Lankford (R-OK), and Jacky Rosen (D-NV) sent a letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee today requesting that the Nonprofit Security Grant Program be adequately funded to meet the needs of at-risk organizations this fiscal year. The funding allocated by this program will support non-profit organizations most at risk of terror attacks through the acquisition and installation of physical target hardening measures, related preparedness and prevention planning, training, and exercises, and contracted security personnel so that religious and community-based organizations have the critical resources and tools they need to protect lives and property. According to a recent FBI report on hate crime statistics in 2019, 60.2 percent were victims of crimes motivated by offenders’ anti-Jewish bias.
“The rise in anti-semitic and hate-fueled crimes across New York is unconscionable. No community should have to live in fear due to who they are or how they worship,” said Senator Gillibrand. “The Nonprofit Security Grant Program is an initiative committed to keeping nonprofits deemed at risk of terrorist attacks safer through critical investments in their physical security. I will always fight to expand NSGP grants so that New Yorkers, and Americans across the country, can gather communally or worship freely and safely, against the threat of violence. ”
“FEMA’s Nonprofit Security Grant Program is vitally important to ensure nonprofits, particularly faith-based organizations, have the resources necessary to invest in physical security enhancements, training, and contract security personnel to protect against potential attacks. At a time when we have seen a rise in violence against communities of faith, we have a responsibility to ensure this program is appropriately funded to protect at-risk organizations and communities. I am proud to join my bipartisan colleagues to support this crucial program,” said Senator Portman.
“Places of worship should be a safe haven, and the Nonprofit Security Grant Program is a vital resource for synagogues, mosques and churches that are working to protect their congregations in light of tragic attacks,” said Senator Peters. “I have long championed this program, and I’m proud to join my colleagues to call for robust funding that will help ensure houses of worship, cultural institutions and nonprofit organizations in Michigan and across the country can use this important tool to improve their security and continue serving our communities. ”
“This grant program is vital to ensure faith- and community-based nonprofits and houses of worship can keep people safe as they engage with those they serve,” said Senator Lankford. “As anti-Semitism reached a frightening new high last year, we must continue to find ways to help prevent terrorist acts and also empower our nonprofits to proactively establish safeguards and security measures, which they sadly need to do but don’t necessarily have the funds to fully accomplish without these opportunities for federal assistance. ”
“Anti-Semitic violence in the U.S has grown at an alarming rate,” said Senator Rosen. “Whether it’s in Nevada or in any state across the country, we must stand up against hateful violence. I am proud to join my colleagues in demanding that we properly protect places of worship. I will continue working to ensure the security and safety for Nevadans and all Americans. ”
“Jewish communities worldwide have witnessed firsthand the rise of antisemitism and hate motivated violent attacks. In our schools, synagogues and community centers we have been targeted by hate and extremists and those looking to mimic their disgusting and deplorable tactics,” said Eric Fingerhut, President and CEO of the Jewish Federations of North America.“We know that eradicating antisemitism means addressing violent hate and extremism wherever it exits in partnership with our elected officials and law enforcement. For these reasons we thank Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, along with Senators Rob Portman, Gary Peters, James Lankford and Jackie Rosen, for their leadership on urging increased funding this year to meet the growing security needs of nonprofit faith- and community-based organizations. ”
Every year, Congress must specifically allocate funding for the NSGP. The Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP) helps nonprofits, deemed by the Department of Homeland Security to be at risk of attack, plan for and ready themselves against potential attacks. In addition to hardening facilities, this program has improved efforts to keep at-risk nonprofit organizations safe by promoting emergency preparedness coordination and collaboration activities between public and private community representatives, as well as with state and local government agencies.
For years, Senator Gillibrand has successfully pushed to include funding for the NSGP in the budget. In 2019, Gillibrand and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer successfully fought to secure $90 million in funding for the NSGP, a $30 million increase from 2018. The Jewish community remains the top target of faith-based hate crimes in the U.S for the 23rd consecutive year, and Senator Gillibrand will continue to prioritize the safety of these communities throughout New York State.
Read the text of the letter here or below:
Dear Chairmen Shelby and Capito, Vice Chairman Leahy, and Ranking Member Tester,
Thank you for your continued support for the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP) under the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) and the State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP). As you finalize the Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 Homeland Security Appropriations bill, we respectfully ask you to fund NSGP at the funding level that reflects increased risks to the nonprofit sector. Presently, the House and Senate drafts are far apart on recommended levels of funding for the program. The House top line is $360 million and the Senate’s $90 million. During conference, we urge you to ensure the NSGP is appropriately funded to meet the needs of at-risk populations. At a time of heightened threat to nonprofit faith- and community-based organizations, a bolstered NSGP will continue to provide our nonprofit partners with critical resources and tools they need to protect lives and property.
The NSGP provides for grants to nonprofits deemed at risk of terrorist (or violent extremist) attack, to acquire and install physical security enhancements, conduct preparedness planning, training and exercises, and contract security personnel. The program has improved efforts to keep at-risk nonprofit organizations safe by promoting emergency preparedness coordination and collaboration between public and private community representatives as well as state and local government agencies. Today’s quickly evolving threat environment provides a compelling public interest in protecting against attacks on the nonprofit sector that would disrupt the vital health, human, social, cultural, religious, and other humanitarian services and practices they provide to communities, and which threaten the lives and well-being of millions of Americans who operate, utilize, live, and work in proximity to them.
At the beginning of this year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Homeland Security and National Counterterrorism Center jointly assessed that Domestic Violent Extremists and Racially/Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremists (RMVEs) will continue to pose a lethal threat to faith-based communities, particularly the Jewish community, and remain concerned about the difficulty of detecting lone offenders due to the individualized nature of the radicalization process.[1] During a recent Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearing on threats to the Homeland, FBI Director Christopher Wray testified that the number one threat the nation faces from domestic violent extremists stems from RMVEs, who are considered the most lethal of all domestic extremists in the post-911 environment.[2] To illustrate his point, Director Wray recounted the arrest last November of Richard Holzer on federal domestic terrorism and hate crime charges for attempting to blow up a historic synagogue in Pueblo, Colorado and provoke “a racial holy war. ”[3]
Additionally, according to the latest FBI Hate Crime Statistics 2019 report,[4]which was released earlier this month, reported hate crimes motivated by religious bias increased by 100 to a total of 1,650 in 2019, of which more than 60 percent were anti-Jewish incidents (a more than 14% increase). Per this reporting, the Jewish community remains the top target of faith-based hate crimes for the 23rd consecutive year.
These assessments underscore the persistent threat of lethal violence and hate crimes against the Jewish community and other faith- and community-based institutions in the United States.
These groups have too frequently been the victim of many different types of violence. At this time of rising concern, FEMA has reported that on average only about one-third of nonprofits seeking critical security investments secure funding, annually.[5] The requests exceed the available resources every year. Yet, in today’s threat environment, demand for NSGP resources is expected to grow substantially more, further widening the needs gap.
Since its inception, the program has maintained bi-partisan, bicameral support as an efficient and effective means to accomplish a great deal of security enhancement and preparedness through modest grants.[6] With this support and for the reasons stated above, we respectfully encourage you to bolster the NSGP funding, so our nation can do all that it can to protect at-risk faith- and community- based nonprofits from increasing extremist and hate-motivated threats.
Thank you for your consideration of this request.
Sincerely,"

""But it's clear that the impact of the pandemic will be lengthy, and that Delta will need to be a smaller airline over the next few years.""
The packages include cash severance payments, continued health care benefits, enhanced travel privileges, and career-transition support.
""We hope to see enough participation in these programs to help us avoid the need for involuntary furloughs later this year,"" Bastian said.
The airline industry has been hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak, the steps taken to slow the spread of the disease, and the collapse of the travel industry.
On Wednesday, Delta said it expected to fall 90% from a year earlier due to the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.
Earlier this month, Delta and its working to avoid furloughs of roughly 2,300 pilots as the carrier contends with a drop in demand due to the coronavirus shutdown.
Separately, Bastian said Delta is partnering with the Mayo Clinic and Quest Diagnostics and will test all workers for covid-19. 
Bastian said Delta would be starting the program in Minneapolis next week, and then add Atlanta, Detroit and New York, ""which will evolve into a full testing program.""
Bastian also addressed the issue of racial unrest, which erupted when George Floyd, an African-American man, was killed while being arrested by Minneapolis police on May 25.
Georgia, Bastian said, is one of five states that currently doesn't have a hate-crime law. Delta joined other businesses in the state asking the Georgia General Assembly to quickly pass hate-crime legislation. "

This group is aiming to provide Asian students and the community the support and resources they need to thrive at Madison College.
Caitlyn Lee, the student who started the ball rolling for this initiative shared what brought her to get this group together. ""So I just started reading all these articles and learning about all these things that have been happening to the Asian community, and before I was hearing stuff from my friends and family about incidences that had affected their friends and family, and people they know. I always kept that at the back of my mind, but I wasn't really fully thinking about it as school was starting and approaching. I started to get more into it and how much it has really affected the Asian community.""
Lee saw news of an incident in Brooklyn, New York, where an 89-year-old Asian woman was set on fire. Suspects were arrested by NYPD, but the incident is not being classified as a hate crime and has generated a great deal of attention and action in the Asian-American community over the police not treating this as a hate incident. ""Struggling to find help and who did it and seeing a large part of the Asian community be silenced, or not be listened to. It has really spurred me into being like 'what are we doing now?' and 'what is the Madison College community doing?'""
""This is one of many, one of several incidences that have affected the Asian Community ... there are so many other incidences of discrimination and hate incidences and hate crimes that don't go reported. So, I just really wanted to focus on the community.""
""I was taking a look on the website and noticed there wasn't a statement supporting the Asian Community... for me it was really disappointing and demoralizing.""
Months and months after the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes, hate incidences, and discrimination due to COVID-19, there was still no public response from the college addressing these issues specifically. The college has made statements about anti-racism and provided resources to help the community work toward equity and inclusion, but nothing directly focused on this rise in issues affecting Asian students and people in Madison.
""I took the time to start researching what other schools were doing, and what other universities, how they were responding to the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes and discrimination. They were doing a lot more than we were,"" said Lee.
""We noticed these issues, we noticed a lack of structure... a lack of platform for the Asian student community to voice their opinion, or to even gather to be honest, to have a safe place,"" said Desia Xiong, another student at the college who is working to organize this initiative.
This group is focused on the Asian community, but it is also trying to centralize what resources they can get together to make it easier for people to report hate crimes, find support, and make it easier to take action against all types of discrimination. The meetings are intended to give Asian voices a chance to be heard and give people of all different backgrounds a chance to hear and understand the Asian community.
""Our discussion series, called Empower Our Asian Voices, we wanted to be a bi-monthly regular meeting, like a social platform where we can invite Asian-American members of the community, its not just exclusive to Madison College, but other Asian students to come and discuss the topics that are important to us. Mainly, we're going to start with talking about COVID and how it has affected our community, and then mental health... and then we will talk about the Asian-American experience.""
Other topics they want to go over are K-pop culture, disabilities in the Asian community, issues young Asian men are facing and what support systems they have, drinking culture in Asian communities, and interracial relationships.
""To be able to broaden the discussion series so that it enables us to kind of connect with each other too, which I think is a missing component at Madison college, is just being able to connect with other students. ASA is a club that is more focused on social activities ... this is hopefully to create a safe space to talk about topics that might sit at the back of our minds, but we're not sure if it's normal. I personally struggle a lot with my Asian-American identity, and I am super excited to have this discussion series because I have always wanted to talk to my Asian peers about these experiences,"" said Xiong.

Gillibrand (D-NY) News Release",FALSE,"U.S. Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Rob Portman (R-OH), Gary Peters (D-MI), James Lankford (R-OK), and Jacky Rosen (D-NV) sent a letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee today requesting that the Nonprofit Security Grant Program be adequately funded to meet the needs of at-risk organizations this fiscal year. The funding allocated by this program will support non-profit organizations most at risk of terror attacks through the acquisition and installation of physical target hardening measures, related preparedness and prevention planning, training, and exercises, and contracted security personnel so that religious and community-based organizations have the critical resources and tools they need to protect lives and property. According to a recent FBI report on hate crime statistics in 2019, 60.2 percent were victims of crimes motivated by offenders' anti-Jewish bias.
""The rise in anti-semitic and hate-fueled crimes across New York is unconscionable. No community should have to live in fear due to who they are or how they worship,"" said Senator Gillibrand. ""The Nonprofit Security Grant Program is an initiative committed to keeping nonprofits deemed at risk of terrorist attacks safer through critical investments in their physical security. I will always fight to expand NSGP grants so that New Yorkers, and Americans across the country, can gather communally or worship freely and safely, against the threat of violence.""
""FEMA's Nonprofit Security Grant Program is vitally important to ensure nonprofits, particularly faith-based organizations, have the resources necessary to invest in physical security enhancements, training, and contract security personnel to protect against potential attacks. At a time when we have seen a rise in violence against communities of faith, we have a responsibility to ensure this program is appropriately funded to protect at-risk organizations and communities. I am proud to join my bipartisan colleagues to support this crucial program,"" said Senator Portman.
""Places of worship should be a safe haven, and the Nonprofit Security Grant Program is a vital resource for synagogues, mosques and churches that are working to protect their congregations in light of tragic attacks,"" said Senator Peters. ""I have long championed this program, and I'm proud to join my colleagues to call for robust funding that will help ensure houses of worship, cultural institutions and nonprofit organizations in Michigan and across the country can use this important tool to improve their security and continue serving our communities.""
""This grant program is vital to ensure faith- and community-based nonprofits and houses of worship can keep people safe as they engage with those they serve,"" said Senator Lankford. ""As anti-Semitism reached a frightening new high last year, we must continue to find ways to help prevent terrorist acts and also empower our nonprofits to proactively establish safeguards and security measures, which they sadly need to do but don't necessarily have the funds to fully accomplish without these opportunities for federal assistance.""
""Anti-Semitic violence in the U.S. has grown at an alarming rate,"" said Senator RoSen. ""Whether it's in Nevada or in any state across the country, we must stand up against hateful violence. I am proud to join my colleagues in demanding that we properly protect places of worship. I will continue working to ensure the security and safety for Nevadans and all Americans.""
""Jewish communities worldwide have witnessed firsthand the rise of antisemitism and hate motivated violent attacks. In our schools, synagogues and community centers we have been targeted by hate and extremists and those looking to mimic their disgusting and deplorable tactics,"" said Eric Fingerhut, President and CEO of the Jewish Federations of North America.""We know that eradicating antisemitism means addressing violent hate and extremism wherever it exits in partnership with our elected officials and law enforcement. For these reasons we thank Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, along with Senators Rob Portman, Gary Peters, James Lankford and Jackie Rosen, for their leadership on urging increased funding this year to meet the growing security needs of nonprofit faith- and community-based organizations.""
Every year, Congress must specifically allocate funding for the NSGP. The Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP) helps nonprofits, deemed by the Department of Homeland Security to be at risk of attack, plan for and ready themselves against potential attacks. In addition to hardening facilities, this program has improved efforts to keep at-risk nonprofit organizations safe by promoting emergency preparedness coordination and collaboration activities between public and private community representatives, as well as with state and local government agencies.
For years, Senator Gillibrand has successfully pushed to include funding for the NSGP in the budget. In 2019, Gillibrand and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer successfully fought to secure $90 million in funding for the NSGP, a $30 million increase from 2018. The Jewish community remains the top target of faith-based hate crimes in the U.S. for the 23rd consecutive year, and Senator Gillibrand will continue to prioritize the safety of these communities throughout New York State.

Dear Chairmen Shelby and Capito, Vice Chairman Leahy, and Ranking Member Tester,
Thank you for your continued support for the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP) under the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) and the State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP). As you finalize the Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 Homeland Security Appropriations bill, we respectfully ask you to fund NSGP at the funding level that reflects increased risks to the nonprofit sector. Presently, the House and Senate drafts are far apart on recommended levels of funding for the program. The House top line is $360 million and the Senate's $90 million. During conference, we urge you to ensure the NSGP is appropriately funded to meet the needs of at-risk populations. At a time of heightened threat to nonprofit faith- and community-based organizations, a bolstered NSGP will continue to provide our nonprofit partners with critical resources and tools they need to protect lives and property.
The NSGP provides for grants to nonprofits deemed at risk of terrorist (or violent extremist) attack, to acquire and install physical security enhancements, conduct preparedness planning, training and exercises, and contract security personnel. The program has improved efforts to keep at-risk nonprofit organizations safe by promoting emergency preparedness coordination and collaboration between public and private community representatives as well as state and local government agencies. Today's quickly evolving threat environment provides a compelling public interest in protecting against attacks on the nonprofit sector that would disrupt the vital health, human, social, cultural, religious, and other humanitarian services and practices they provide to communities, and which threaten the lives and well-being of millions of Americans who operate, utilize, live, and work in proximity to them.
At the beginning of this year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Homeland Security and National Counterterrorism Center jointly assessed that Domestic Violent Extremists and Racially/Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremists (RMVEs) will continue to pose a lethal threat to faith-based communities, particularly the Jewish community, and remain concerned about the difficulty of detecting lone offenders due to the individualized nature of the radicalization process.[1] During a recent Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearing on threats to the Homeland, FBI Director Christopher Wray testified that the number one threat the nation faces from domestic violent extremists stems from RMVEs, who are considered the most lethal of all domestic extremists in the post-911 environment.[2] To illustrate his point, Director Wray recounted the arrest last November of Richard Holzer on federal domestic terrorism and hate crime charges for attempting to blow up a historic synagogue in Pueblo, Colorado and provoke ""a racial holy war.""[3]
Additionally, according to the latest FBI Hate Crime Statistics 2019 report,[4]which was released earlier this month, reported hate crimes motivated by religious bias increased by 100 to a total of 1,650 in 2019, of which more than 60 percent were anti-Jewish incidents (a more than 14% increase). Per this reporting, the Jewish community remains the top target of faith-based hate crimes for the 23rd consecutive year.
These assessments underscore the persistent threat of lethal violence and hate crimes against the Jewish community and other faith- and community-based institutions in the United States.
These groups have too frequently been the victim of many different types of violence. At this time of rising concern, FEMA has reported that on average only about one-third of nonprofits seeking critical security investments secure funding, annually.[5] The requests exceed the available resources every year. Yet, in today's threat environment, demand for NSGP resources is expected to grow substantially more, further widening the needs gap.
Since its inception, the program has maintained bi-partisan, bicameral support as an efficient and effective means to accomplish a great deal of security enhancement and preparedness through modest grants.[6] With this support and for the reasons stated above, we respectfully encourage you to bolster the NSGP funding, so our nation can do all that it can to protect at-risk faith- and community- based nonprofits from increasing extremist and hate-motivated threats.
Thank you for your consideration of this request.
Sincerely,

When a crime is committed by an individual of one race against an individual of another race, there is the possibility that the crime is a hate crime.

Legislation often mandates harsher penalties for perpetrators convicted of crimes determined to be hate crimes, yet this determination is difficult to make.

These results contribute to the understanding of how crimes in which the perpetrator's and victim's races differ are perceived. hate crimes violent crime racism discrimination rimes classified as hate crimes share common characteristics that distin- C guish them from other forms of violent crime. First, hate crimes are crimes that are committed against individuals because they are perceived to be members of a particular social group. Their perceived membership in that group, not anything idiosyncratic about them as individuals, makes them vul- nerable. Hate crimes are committed by perpetrators who wish to express ani- mosity toward that entire social group. The victims are thus virtually “interchangeable” and often are attacked by strangers (Levin & McDevitt, Authors' Note: Correspondence concerning this article should be addressed to Donald A. Saucier, Department of Psychology, Kansas State University, 468 Bluemont Hall, 1100 Mid- Campus Drive, Manhattan, KS 66506-5302; e-mail: saucier@ksu.edu 686 2002). Second, some authors have argued that hate crimes are particularly vicious (Levin & McDevitt, 2002). Hate crimes are more likely to be com- mitted by multiple perpetrators than are other violent crimes (Levin & McDevitt, 2002), and federal crime statistics suggest that hate crimes are more likely to consist of attacks against people, such as assault, rape, and murder, than attacks against property, such as property damage, vandalism, or arson (U.S. Department of Justice, 2005). When a crime is classified as a hate crime, legislation often mandates more severe penalties for that crime than for a similar crime that is not classified as a hate crime (Cramer, 1999; Levin, 2002; Wang, 2001). The rationale for this mandated penalty enhancement includes the argument that hate crimes are more severe, by definition, because they consist of attacks against social groups of which the individual crime victim is (or is perceived to be) a member, rather than against the individual himself or herself. That is, the con- sequences of hate crimes extend beyond the individual victim to the victim's social group (Noelle, 2002) and may therefore constitute a broader attack on society (Iganski, 2001) that, in the case of racist hate crimes, serves to assert the perpetrators' racial identity over that of the victims' (Perry, 2002). In addi- tion, the individual victims of hate crimes may suffer more extreme psycho- logical consequences from hate crime victimization compared to other types of crime victimization (D'Augelli & Grossman, 2001; Herek, Gillis, Cogan, & Glunt, 1997). Furthermore, penalty enhancement for hate crimes has been argued to be important in preventing future crimes by both deterring future hate crimes of similar type and rendering the need for retaliatory violence by the victim or the victim's group (Barnes & Ephross, 1994; Rayburn & Davison, 2002) unnecessary. Legislation that mandates penalty enhancement for hate crimes is con- troversial, however (Sullaway, 2004). Opponents of this legislation often argue that hate crimes are not different from or more severe than other crimes of similar type (i.e., “a crime is a crime”). Opponents further assert that the difference between hate crimes and crimes of similar type not con- sidered to be hate crimes are the perpetrators' motivations or thoughts prior to and while committing the crime. Thus, the penalty enhancements are essentially punishing the thoughts of perpetrators, which may be inappro- priate (Iganski, 2001). Another argument states that legislated penalty enhancements for hate crimes may offer another opportunity for minority group members to be discriminated against. This argument highlights the possibility that penalty enhancement may be more severe when the victim is a majority group member and the perpetrator is a minority group member (e.g., White victim, Black perpetrator) than when the victim is a minority 687 group member and the perpetrator is a majority group member (e.g., Black victim, White perpetrator) (Franklin, 2002). The validity of this argument is supported by critical race theory (e.g., Jones, 1998), which states that racial inequalities persist due to cultural views of racism as normal, racist myths, and perpetual White privilege. Another argument against hate crime legislation is that the legislation may be used primarily as a political tool that exaggerates intergroup tensions and allows politicians to ingratiate themselves to minority voters (Jacobs & Henry, 1996). Yet another argu- ment asserts that national crime statistics do not support the need for hate crime legislation (Bakken, 2002). Interestingly, even if there were no controversy regarding the need for hate crime penalty enhancement legislation, the implementation of such legisla- tion would still be problematic because of the difficulty in reliably classify- ing crimes as having been hate-motivated or not (Berk, 1990). The motivation of the perpetrator is the key component of a hate crime (Craig, 2002; Wang, 2001). While committing a hate crime, the perpetrator has attacked a repre- sentative of a social group, and the attack is therefore directed not at the indi- vidual but at that social group. However, perpetrators are not always willing to confess their guilt in a crime, much less their motivations when commit- ting a crime (Dunbar, 1999). Victims may not know why they were targeted (Jacobs & Henry, 1996) and may have to make inferences about the perpe- trators' motivations using the context in which the crime occurred (Herek, Cogan, & Gillis, 2002). Some argue that perpetrators' motivations and poten- tial prejudices may be impossible to measure, and a causal relationship between prejudice and crime may be impossible to show (Sullaway, 2004). One commonly used indicator that a crime was hate-motivated is whether the perpetrator used derogatory slurs to insult the (perceived) social group of the victim while committing the crime (Czajkowski, 1992; Herek et al., 2002). However, even this indicator may not universally distinguish between crimes that are and are not hate-motivated, and law enforcement officers may be unable (Franklin, 2002) or unwilling (Boyd, Berk, & Hamner, 1996) to accu- rately label a crime as a hate crime. The majority of crimes classified by law enforcement agencies as hate crimes are racially motivated (approximately 54% of more than 9,000 single- incident offenses), according to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports. Among racially motivated hate crimes, the most frequently targeted racial groups are Blacks and Whites. Approximately 68% of the victims in single-incident crimes were the victims of anti-Black bias, and approximately 20% were the victims of anti-White bias. Of known offenders in hate crimes, approx- imately 61% were White and approximately 20% were Black. The most 688 common combination of perpetrator and victim races was the situation in which White perpetrators committed crimes against Black victims (approx- imately 37% of racially motivated hate crimes). The second most common combination was the situation in which Black perpetrators committed crimes against White victims (approximately 10% of racially motivated hate crimes). Thus, in summary, in racially motivated hate crimes, Whites and Blacks are the two groups most likely to be involved as perpetrators and victims (U.S. Department of Justice, 2005). This is not to say that the prob- abilities indicate that White and Black individuals will be victims of racially motivated hate crimes at similar levels. The proportion of hate crimes committed as a result of anti-Black bias is much higher than would be expected if the risks for the groups were similar, given that Blacks are victims of hate crimes substantially more than Whites yet constitute a much lower percentage of the population than do Whites. Previous research has examined individuals' perceptions of what hate crimes are and of crimes in which members of one race have assaulted members of another race. Consistent with the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports (U.S. Department of Justice, 2005), individuals believed that hate crimes most often involve attacks against minority groups (Craig & Waldo, 1996; Saucier, Brown, Mitchell, & Cawman, 2006). Individuals also perceived crimes in which the races of perpetrators and victims differed as more severe crimes, per- ceiving more guilt in the perpetrators (Marcus-Newhall, Blake, & Baumann, 2002) and recommending (Marcus-Newhall et al., 2002; Saucier et al., 2006) or expecting (Craig & Waldo, 1996) longer sentences for perpetrators, espe- cially when perpetrators were White and victims were Black (versus when per- petrators were Black and victims were White) (Marcus-Newhall et al., 2002). However, not all evidence suggests that the involvement of hate motivation affects the perceptions of violent crimes (Craig, 1999). The purpose of this study was to examine White individuals' perceptions and recommended punishments of violent crimes. We created crime vignettes that described crimes in which the race of the perpetrator and victim differed, and we systematically varied aspects of the crime vignettes, including the severity of the assault, the races of the perpetrator and victim, and whether the perpetrator used a racial slur during the assault. Furthermore, we assessed participants' levels of racism against Blacks and evaluated the effects of racism on their perceptions and recommended punishments for the crimes. One study has examined the role of racism in perceptions of violent crime (Rayburn, Mendoza, & Davison, 2003). In that study, results showed that more prejudiced individuals saw victims in general (i.e., in both hate and nonhate crimes) as more culpable and perpetrators in general as less culpable. The authors of that study, however, used the Modern Racism Scale (McConahay, 1983) as their 689 measure of racial prejudice—which has been the target of challenges to its validity (Dunton & Fazio, 1997; Fazio, Jackson, Dunton, & Williams, 1995)—and used a median split to create high- and low-prejudiced groups. That analytic strategy creates artificial groups and sacrifices the precision of the participants' actual scores on the measures (Bissonnette, Ickes, Bernstein, & Knowles, 1990a, 1990b; Cohen, 1983). We intended to use a potentially more valid measure of racial prejudice, the Attitudes Toward Blacks Scale (ATB; Brigham, 1993), and to employ regression analyses to retain the variability in participants' scores on the prejudice measure, avoid the creation of artificial groups, and conduct hypothesis testing with more statistical power. Our dependent measures included recommended sen- tences for the crimes, the extents to which victims were blamed for the crimes, ratings of how justifiable the crimes were, and ratings of how well the crimes fit the definition of a hate crime. Method Participants Two hundred twenty-five participants voluntarily participated in this study to partially fulfill the research requirement for their general psychology course. One hundred seven participants were male and 118 were female. Participants' ages ranged from 18 to 43 with a mean of 19.40 (SD = 2.15), and more than 96% of the participants reported ages from 18 to 22. Two hundred one participants were White; 9 were Black; 8 were Latino/a; and 7 reported their race as Asian, Native American, or “Other.” Materials Crime vignettes. Participants read vignettes in which a crime was described. These crime vignettes were similar in structure and content to those used in a previous study (Saucier et al., 2006). In each vignette, a male perpe- trator assaulted a male victim after a brief verbal exchange that witnesses could not hear, and was found guilty at the subsequent trial. The type of assault was varied, with the perpetrator repeatedly hitting the victim in simple assault cases and repeatedly slashing the victim in aggravated assault cases. The perpetrator/victim races were varied so that vignettes reported either a crime by a White perpetrator against a Black victim or by a Black perpetrator against a White victim. Finally, the insult used by the perpetrator to deni- grate the victim during the assault was varied so that the perpetrator used 690 either a racial slur or profanity. In the racial slur conditions, the White per- petrator called the Black victim a “nigger” or the Black perpetrator called the White victim a “cracker.” In the profanity conditions, both the White and Black perpetrators called the Black and White victims, respectively, an “asshole.” This study employed a 2 (assault type) × 2 (perpetrator/victim races) × 2 (insult) between-groups design so that 8 different crime vignettes were used. The vignette for the simple assault, Black perpetrator/White vic- tim, racial slur condition is provided below for illustrative purposes. Case Brief: The State vs. Jeffrey Richards Imagine that you are the presiding judge in a criminal court case. You are trying a case in which a man is being tried on the charge of simple assault. Witnesses testified that the defendant, Jeffrey Richards, an African American male in his thirties, approached Don Anderson, a White male in his twenties, and after a brief verbal exchange, Mr. Richards repeatedly punched Mr. Anderson while calling him a “stupid cracker.” Based on the witnesses' testimonies, the jury did find Mr. Richards guilty on the charge of simple assault. Please answer the fol- lowing questions about this case as honestly as you can. Racism measure. Participants completed the ATB (Brigham, 1993) as the measure of their racial attitudes toward Blacks. This measure was chosen due to its widespread use as a self-report measure of anti-Black prejudice in the social psychological literature. Scores on the ATB have been shown to be associated with other self-report measures of the expression and control of prejudice (e.g., Plant & Devine, 1998; Saucier & Miller, 2003), with behavioral expressions of prejudice (e.g., Dovidio, Kawakami, & Gaertner, 2002), and with attitudes toward race-relevant legislation (e.g., Swim & Miller, 1999). Participants reported their agreement with each of 20 statements regarding their attitudes toward Blacks using 9-point Likert-type scales from 1 (not at all) to 9 (very much). Scores were calculated as the average response per item, with higher scores indicating more negative attitudes toward Blacks. A sample item is “Generally, Blacks are not as smart as Whites.” The internal consistency of the ATB was very good in this study, alpha = .86. For our sample, participants' scores ranged from 1.00 to 8.20 and approximated a normal distribution around the mean of 3.46 (SD = 1.26). This indicated that whereas the levels of racism reported by participants as a group were relatively low, there was meaningful variability in the responding. This pattern of responding is comparable to the pat- terns shown by other college student samples (e.g., Dovidio et al., 2002; Saucier & Miller, 2003). Social desirability measure. Participants completed the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (Crowne & Marlowe, 1964). This measure was 691 included because the possibility existed that participants' responses on the racism measure and on the dependent measures could have been influenced by social desirability concerns. This scale consisted of 33 true-false items con- sisting of statements that participants who are motivated to present themselves in socially desirable ways are likely to report as being true (e.g., “I'm always willing to admit it when I make a mistake”) or false (e.g., “I sometimes feel resentful when I don't get my way”) of themselves. Participants' scores on this measure consisted of the number of socially desirable responses they reported. The internal consistency of this scale was good in this study, alpha = .73. Procedure Participants completed randomly assigned questionnaire packets that each contained one of the eight crime vignettes as well as the measures of racism and social desirability. After reading the crime vignettes, participants responded to items that assessed several dependent measures, including what sentence they would recommend for the perpetrator if they were the judge presiding over the case after the guilty verdict had been handed down by the jury, how justifiable the crime was, how much to blame the victim was for the crime committed against him, and how much the crime fit the definition of a hate crime. Participants responded to the recommended sentence item using a Likert-type scale from 1 (minimum sentence) to 9 (maximum sentence). Although this did not allow for participants to recommend “no sentence” for the perpetrator, it did allow for participants to recommend sentences that were relatively low to relatively high for an individual found guilty of that particular crime. Participants responded to the other items using Likert-type scales from 1 (not at all) to 9 (very much). It should be noted that the partic- ipants were not asked to provide a rating of how guilty the perpetrator was. This is consistent with the procedure used by Saucier et al. (2006) and was used to avoid creating difficulties in responding to the other dependent mea- sures for participants who may have found the perpetrator “not guilty.” Participants completed the packets in groups of approximately 15 partici- pants, and their participation took approximately 35 minutes. Results Potential Social Desirability Effects The participants' scores on the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale were not significantly correlated with any of the dependent measures, 692 rs < .14, ps > .05, or with the participants' scores on the ATB, r = .03, p = .646. We therefore did not include participants' social desirability scores in any sub- sequent analyses and will not further discuss social desirability as a variable. Relationships Between Dependent Measures The sentences given to perpetrators by participants were positively cor- related with the extent to which they reported the crime fit the definition of a hate crime, r = .30, p < .001, and negatively correlated with the extent to which they reported the victim was to blame for the crime, r = –.13, p = .045. The sentences were not correlated with how justifiable they reported the crime to be, r = –.02, p = .770. Perceptions of the justifiability of the crime were positively correlated with the perceived extent to which the vic- tim was to blame, r = .37, p < .001, but uncorrelated with how well the crime fit the hate crime definition, r = .07, p = .320. How well the crime fit the hate crime definition was negatively correlated with the extent to which the victim was blamed, r = –.16, p = .018. Condition Effects Analytic strategy. We used 2 (assault type) × 2 (perpetrator/victim races) × 2 (insult) between-groups analyses of variance to assess differences on each of the dependent measures. Because the races of the perpetrator and victims were varied, only participants who reported that they were White were included in the analyses. These participants would share race with either the perpetrator or the victim in all conditions. The number of participants who were Black was not sufficient to provide an adequate comparison group, and the participants who were Latino/a, Asian, Native American, or “Other” did not share the race of the perpetrator or the victim in any condition. Sentence for the perpetrator. Significant main effects were found for assault type, F(1, 192) = 52.02, p < .001, and for perpetrator/victim races, F(1, 192) = 11.59, p = .001, regarding the sentences given to perpetrators by participants. Significantly longer sentences were given for aggravated assaults, M = 7.09, SD = 1.53, than for simple assaults, M = 5.19, SD = 2.20, unsurprisingly. Of greater interest, participants gave significantly longer sentences to White per- petrators who assaulted Black victims, M = 6.51, SD = 2.05, than to Black perpetrators who assaulted White victims, M = 5.65, SD = 2.13. The main effect for the insult and all interactions between the independent variables failed to reach significance, all Fs(1, 192) < 1.66, ps > .19. 693 Justifiability of the crime. For the ratings of how justifiable the crime was, only the main effect for perpetrator/victim races even approached sig- nificant levels, F(1, 192) = 3.22, p = .074. This suggested that participants tended slightly to report that crimes committed by Black perpetrators against White victims, M = 3.09, SD = 2.19, were more justifiable than crimes committed by White perpetrators against Black victims, M = 2.53, SD = 2.33. This interpretation is offered cautiously given that the effect failed to reach conventional levels of significance and the failure of the other variables to affect the justifiability ratings. The main effects for assault type and insult and all interactions between the independent vari- ables failed to reach to significance, Fs(1, 192) < 2.67, ps > .10. Blaming the crime on the victim. Significant main effects for assault type, F(1, 191) = 4.04, p = .046, and for perpetrator/victim races, F(1, 191) = 18.81, p < .001, emerged for the extent to which participants reported the victim was to blame for the crime. Participants reported that victims were more to blame for simple assaults than for aggravated assaults and that White vic- tims were more to blame for being assaulted by Black perpetrators than Black victims were to blame for being assaulted by White perpetrators. These main effects were qualified by a two-way interaction between assault type and perpetrator/victim races, F(1, 191) = 6.59, p = .011. Simple effects analyses indicated that this interaction was produced because the extent to which Black victims were blamed for being assaulted by White perpetra- tors was not different when the assault was simple, M = 2.49, SD = 1.65, versus aggravated, M = 2.65, SD = 1.78, F(1, 191) < 1; whereas the extent to which White victims were blamed for being assaulted by Black perpe- trators was greater when the assault was simple, M = 4.20, SD = 2.10, ver- sus aggravated, M = 3.09, SD = 1.38, F(1, 191) = 9.18, p < .005. The main effect for insult and all other interactions between the independent variables failed to reach significance, Fs(1, 191) < 2.23, ps > .13. Crime fit the definition of a hate crime. Significant main effects were found for assault type, F(1, 191) = 3.98, p = .047, and for insult, F(1, 191) = 41.81, p < .001, for the participants' ratings of how well the crime fit the definition of a hate crime. These results indicated that participants reported that aggravated assaults, M = 6.73, SD = 2.31, fit the hate crime definition better than did simple assaults, M = 6.08, SD = 2.44; and that crimes in which the perpetrator used a racial slur during the assault, M = 7.36, SD = 1.95, fit the hate crime definition better than crimes in which the perpetrator used profanity, M = 5.36, SD = 2.39. The main effect for perpetrator/victim races and all interactions 694 between the independent variables failed to reach significance, Fs(1, 191) < 2.70, ps > .10. Racism Effects Analytic strategy. We used hierarchical multiple regression to control for all possible condition effects described above for each of the dependent variables. After entering the terms for the main effects of and interactions between assault type, perpetrator/victim races, and insult, we entered the participants' scores on the ATB and the product terms carrying the two-, three-, and four-way interactions between ATB and the other independent variables in subsequent steps of the analysis. The participants' ATB scores individually and interactively were assessed for their ability to improve the predictive models for each of the dependent variables. Sentence for the perpetrator. The predictive model for the participants' rec- ommended sentences for the perpetrator was not improved when the partici- pants' ATB scores were added to the analysis, R2 change = .006, F(1, 186) = 1.64, p = .202. The model was improved when the two-way interactions between the ATB scores and the other independent variables were entered, R2 change = .055, F(3, 183) = 4.98, p = .002, with the interaction between ATB scores and perpetrator/victim races reaching significance, t = 3.66, p < .001. Simple slopes analyses revealed that participants' ATB scores were sig- nificantly negatively correlated with the sentences they recommended for White perpetrators who assaulted Black victims, β = –.337, p = .003, and were marginally positively correlated with the sentences they recommended for Black perpetrators who assaulted White victims, β = .206, p = .074. That is, higher levels of racism were associated with less severe sentencing for crimes by Whites against Blacks, and higher levels of racism tended to be associated with more severe sentencing for crimes by Blacks against Whites. No other two-way, three-way, or four-way interactions including ATB scores improved the predictive model or reached significance. Justifiability of the crime. The predictive model for the participants' rat- ings of the justifiability of the crime was improved by the addition of the participants' ATB scores, R2 change = .024, F(1, 186) = 4.75, p = .031, such that higher racism scores were associated with ratings that the crimes were more justifiable, β = .156. The addition of the two-way interactions includ- ing the ATB scores further improved the predictive model, R2 change = .042, F(3, 183) = 2.86, p = .038, with an interaction between ATB scores 695 and assault type reaching significance, t = 2.62, p = .010, and qualifying the main effect above. Simple slopes analyses revealed that ATB scores were positively correlated with the justifiability ratings of aggravated assaults, β = .424, p = .002, but were uncorrelated with justifiability ratings of simple assaults, β = –.099, p = .443. No other two-way, three-way, or four-way interactions including ATB scores improved the predictive model or reached significance. Blaming the crime on the victim. The predictive model for how much the participants reported that the victim was to blame for the assault was not improved by the addition of the participants' ATB scores as a main effect, R2 change = .004, F(1, 185) < 1, but was improved by the addition of the two- way interactions including the ATB scores, R2 change = .044, F(3, 182) = 3.32, p = .021, and later by the four-way interaction including all predictors, R2 change = .020, F(1, 178) = 4.73, p = .031. The addition of the four-way interaction including the ATB scores, the assault type, the perpetrator/ victim races, and insult qualified any two-way interactions, and we will therefore forgo discussion of the two-way interactions to focus on the four- way interaction. We used simple slopes analysis to probe the four-way interaction. This allowed us to assess the relationships between participants' ATB scores and the ratings of how much the victim was to blame in each of the conditions of the study. This analysis revealed that participants' levels of racism on the ATB were associated with their ratings of victim blame when a Black per- petrator committed a simple assault against a White victim and used a racial slur. In this condition, higher racism scores on the ATB were associated with lower ratings of victim blame, β = –.746, p < .001. The only other simple slope to approach significance was in the condition in which a Black perpetrator committed a simple assault against a White victim and used a profanity. In this condition, higher racism scores tended to be associated with higher ratings of victim blame, β = .389, p = .067. Taken together, these results suggest the individuals with higher levels of racism are espe- cially unlikely to place the blame for a crime on the victim when the victim is a member of their own race and when it is more clearly racially moti- vated. Individuals lower in racism blame the victim of their own race more in that situation. When the crime is not clearly racially motivated, those higher in racism tend to be more likely to blame the victim for the offense. All other simple slopes failed to show relationships between participants' ATB scores and their ratings of victim blame, βs < .31, ps > .09. These rela- tionships are illustrated in Figure 1. 696 Figure 1 Projected Means for Ratings of Victim Blame for the Assault by Individuals Scoring One Standard Deviation Above and Below the Mean on the Attitudes Toward Blacks Scale (ATB) in Each of the Experimental Conditions Note: Sim = simple assault; Agg = aggravated assault; WpBv = White perpetrator, Black victim; BpWv = Black perpetrator, White victim; Sl = slur; Pr = profanity. Crime fit the definition of a hate crime. The predictive model for how much participants reported that the crimes fit the definition of a hate crime was not improved significantly by the addition of participants' ATB scores or any interaction terms including participants' ATB scores. Discussion The purpose of this study was to investigate the factors that affect indi- viduals' perceptions and punishments of violent crimes involving perpetra- tors and victims of different races. Specifically, we assessed the contributions of the nature of the assault, the races of the perpetrators and victims, whether a racial slur was used during the assault, and White par- ticipants' levels of racism toward Blacks in their perceptions of an assault case in which the perpetrator was found guilty. Results indicated that the features of the assault case did affect the participants' perceptions of the crime. Participants recommended longer sentences for crimes involving aggravated assaults (versus simple assaults) and for White perpetrators who assaulted Black victims (versus Black perpetrators who assaulted White 697 victims). Participants indicated that crimes that were aggravated assaults and crimes during which the perpetrators used racial slurs were more fitting of the definition of a hate crime. Furthermore, (White) participants reported that White victims were more to blame when assaulted by Black victims in simple assault cases. In addition, White participants' levels of racism toward Blacks influenced their perceptions of the crimes. Results indicated that lower levels of racism were associated with higher ratings of blame for White victims who were assaulted by Black perpetrators in simple assault cases. Higher levels of racism were associated with less severe sentences recommended for White perpetrators who assaulted Black victims and were marginally associated with more severe sentences recommended for Black perpetrators who assaulted White victims. In summary, the characteristics of crimes committed by members of one race against members of another race, including the severity of the crime, the races of the perpetrators and the victims, and whether racial slurs were used by perpetrators, along with individuals' levels of racism, affected how individuals perceived and punished those crimes. The use of racial slurs during a crime by the perpetrator(s) is often used to indicate that the crime was hate-motivated (Czajkowski, 1992; Herek et al., 2002). Our results indicate that our participants did use this feature of the crime as an indicator of hate motivation. These results do not neces- sarily demonstrate the validity of distinguishing between hate- and non-hate- motivated crimes by ascertaining the use of racial slurs by the perpetrator(s). However, these results do provide empirical support that the use of racial slurs as an indicator of hate motivation is a common perception among those who review instances of violent crimes committed by a member of one race against a member of another race. That participants generally recommended longer sentences for crimes com- mitted by White perpetrators against Black victims than for crimes committed by Black perpetrators against White victims is consistent with the results of Marcus-Newhall et al. (2002) that showed this same pattern of results and with the results of Craig and Waldo (1996) that showed that individuals believed that hate crimes typically involve majority group perpetrators and minority group victims. This would tend to diminish the argument that penalty enhancement legislation for hate crimes could be misused to discriminate against minority group perpetrators who commit crimes against majority group victims compared to the reversed situation (Franklin, 2002). However, our findings for the relationships between participants' racism levels and rec- ommended sentences for White against Black versus Black against White assaults show that the discrimination in penalty enhancement speculated by Franklin (2002) is possible. Although it should be noted that our study used 698 college students who completed questionnaires and these results may or may not generalize to how judges and juries actually perceive and punish violent crimes, these results do indicate that is it possible (but not necessarily prob- able) that racism may be expressed through the implementation of penalty enhancement legislation. The relationships between participants' levels of racism and the extent to which they blamed the victims for the crime were inconsistent with previous research findings that showed that participants with higher levels of antigay atti- tudes were more negative to gay victims of hate crimes and more supportive of the perpetrators (Rayburn & Davison, 2002). This inconsistency may be due to our use of race as the characteristic targeted by the hate crime perpetrator ver- sus the use of sexual orientation in the previous study by Rayburn and Davison (2002). It is likely that there is greater concern among participants about appearing nonracist than about appearing nonprejudiced toward individuals on the basis of sexual orientation. It may be that sexual orientation is a character- istic that individuals view as a choice or preference, whereas race is obviously something outside an individual's control. This distinction may make the expression of sexual prejudice appear more appropriate and more normative (i.e., more socially acceptable) than the expression of racial prejudice (e.g., Crandall & Eshleman, 2003) and may contribute to this inconsistency. Regarding the perceptions of the crime vignettes, our participants' rec- ommended sentences for the perpetrators were positively correlated to their ratings of how much the crime fit the definition of a hate crime. These results are consistent with past research that showed similar findings (Saucier et al., 2006). This indicates that individuals may believe that hate motivated offenses are more severe and are thus more deserving of more severe penalties that non-hate-motivated offenses, providing empirical sup- port for the arguments made by advocates of hate crime penalty enhance- ment legislation. This pattern of results emerged despite the fact that our participants were not told that these crimes were, or might be, hate crimes or that hate crimes should be punished more severely. A major limitation of our study that warrants attention is that we exam- ined how participants perceived and recommended punishments for violent crimes using scenarios created for this study in a laboratory setting. Our participants were undergraduate students, not actual judges or prosecutors who would be in more realistic positions to recommend sentencing for per- petrators of violent crimes. Accordingly, we cannot generalize our results to actual sentencing outcomes. A second possible limitation is that we employed an explicit (i.e., conscious) measure of racism in this study. As noted earlier, scores on the ATB (Brigham, 1993) have correlated with other 699 self-report measures of the expression and control of prejudice (e.g., Plant & Devine, 1998; Saucier & Miller, 2003), with behavioral expressions of preju- dice (e.g., Dovidio et al., 2002), and with attitudes toward race-relevant legisla- tion (e.g., Swim & Miller, 1999). However, it is possible that implicit (i.e., unconscious) measures of racism may have showed different patterns of effects than those reported for this study. For instance, a study by Bridges and Steen (1998) demonstrated that more indirect measures (e.g., how much crimes were attributed to internal and external circumstances) were associated with less conscious biases in sentencing patterns of White and Black perpetrators. In addition, the Bridges and Steen (1998) study used individuals associated with the criminal justice system (e.g., probation officers), furthering the rationale for our earlier caution against generalizing our laboratory results to actual sentencing outcomes. In conclusion, our study examined the features that affected the perceptions and punishments of violent crimes in scenarios in which the races of the per- petrators and victims differed. Our results indicated that several features of the crime scenarios affected the perceptions and punishments of the crimes, including the races of the perpetrators and victims, whether the perpetrator used a racial slur during the commission of the crime, the severity of the assault, and the racism levels of the individuals who reported their perceptions and recommendations for punishments of the crimes. More empirical work is needed to further reveal the processes that affect the perception and punish- ment of violent crime. However, these findings contribute to the understand- ing of how crimes, in laboratory settings, are determined to be hate crimes; how hate crimes are perceived and punished; and how racism may affect these determinations, perceptions, and punishments.

Consider donating[1] today to support our mission. 
Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed police reform legislation Friday that will ban chokeholds by police officers, designate false race-based 911 calls as hate crimes and make police disciplinary records more transparent. The legislation will effectively end Civil Rights Law 50-a, which protects the disciplinary records of police officers in New York state, Cuomo said at a press briefing Friday. Cuomo will also issue an executive order mandating that local police departments develop reform plans to 'reinvent and modernize police strategies and programs.' Departments that do not adopt reform plans by April 1 will not receive state funding, Cuomo said. The legislation follows several weeks of protests in response to the killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by a Minneapolis police officer. Derek Chauvin, the officer who killed Floyd by kneeling on his neck for several minutes, faces charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter. The three other officers present during Floyd's killing face charges of aiding and abetting murder. 'The truth is police reform is long overdue,' Cuomo said. 'Mr. Floyd's murder is just the most recent murder.' The legislation will also make the state's attorney general the independent prosecutor in killings of unarmed civilians by police. Cuomo wants to restore trust between police and their communities, he said. Civil rights activist Rev. Al Sharpton, who sat beside Cuomo as he signed the legislation, commended the governor's plan to withhold state funding from police departments that don't propose reform measures. 'These bills mean some substantive change so that we won't be sitting here going over this after the next funeral,' Sharpton said. https://donate.dailyorange.com/ The post New York state bans police chokeholds, makes disciplinary records public[2] appeared first on The Daily Orange[3].

According to the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office[1], officers early Saturday morning responded to what they thought was a 'suicide by hanging' off an I-95 overpass on the city's Northside. 'Upon arrival, officers discovered it was actually a mannequin dressed in a [New York Police Department] uniform wearing a pig mask,' JSO said. 'We are thankful it was not a real person.' While no one was hurt by the action physically, the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office takes it very seriously, as the agency statement indicates. 'Our Crime Scene detectives are processing the scene and the mannequin will be processed for DNA,' the statement asserts. 'Our goal at this point is to identify persons of interest for the sake of, most importantly, the safety of the community and for officer safety.'

The story is developing, and will be updated. Effigy hangings such as this have become a trend, with symbolic violence perpetrated by protesters and counter-protesters against figures on both the left and the right of the current political spectrum. In Oakland, where an effigy was found hanging from a tree earlier this week, the action is being investigated as a hate crime, and local and state law enforcement is working closely with the FBI, according toCBS News Bay Area[2]. http://nickdiceglie.com/;In that context, it bears watching how this investigation develops, given the high-profile event headed to Jacksonville in August. Protests, by and large, have been peaceful in the last few weeks. But Jacksonville, as it prepares to host an incendiary President making what will be a series of call-to-action provocations, along with protesters from the left and right and potential destabilizing influences beyond that, will be under the microscope as it rushes to finalize logistics of the biggest political event in the city's history.

Issue threatens to further divide community already estranged over Trump-Biden battle",FALSE,"NEW YORK - Accusations of antisemitism against New York's Democratic leadership are threatening to drive a further wedge between the already wide gap between right-of-center Orthodox and left-of-center progressive Jews in the state.
Last week, conservative and right-of-center New Yorkers accused their state's Democratic leadership of implementing antisemitic policies, with one group calling Gov. Andrew Cuomo the ""most antisemitic governor in America.""
In one particularly sharp accusation, the New York Young Republican Club labeled Cuomo's director of Jewish affairs a ""court Jew,"" and tweeted that he was ""working for the most antisemitic governor in America.""
On December 1, according to the JTA, the club wrote on Twitter to Cuomo staffer Jake Adler, ""Imagine being Jewish and working for the most antisemitic governor in America. You are a disgrace and pathetic. Shouldn't you guys be arresting Orthodox Jews in BK [Brooklyn]? Keep being a good boy for your failed corrupt boss.""
When David Greenfield, an Orthodox Jew and CEO of the Met Council on Jewish Poverty, vouched for Adler in a tweet, the Young Republicans responded with the ""court Jew"" accusation. The reference was to Jews who once worked in royal courts in exchange for special privileges not afforded other Jews. It has become a slur, disparaging Jews who are seen as selling out communal interests to advance their own status.
""Court Jews defending the blatant antisemitism of Cuomo is so repugnant & vile it's almost too unreal to behold,"" the Young Republicans tweeted. ""Thankfully our club leadership is full of proud Jews who are happy to call a spade a spade and not cover up the systemic discrimination and persecution of hassidic Jews.""
In response, the Anti-Defamation League's regional office tweeted, ""Everyone has the right to disagree w/public policy & political positions, but resorting to tropes should be off limits.""
The Young Republicans then tweeted that the ADL was a ""sham"" and told the civil rights group to ""shut up.""
Progressive Jewish leaders fired back that the claims could lead to long-term repercussions for New York-Jewish community relations already frayed by the acrimonious political atmosphere surrounding President Donald Trump and his campaign against President-elect Joe Biden.
""My fear is that the use of the term 'antisemitism' to score political points could delegitimize the word,"" said Rabbi Joshua Stanton, who leads East End Temple, a Reform congregation in Manhattan. ""It could cause an inflation of use in the term to the point that it loses its great significance. I'm worried that when I call out for help, when I see real and true antisemitism, people will not pay attention.""
New York Young Republican Club president Gavin Wax, who is Jewish and identifies as religious but not Orthodox, defended the tweets to The Jerusalem Post.
""If you are going to be so offended by two Jews online trash-talking each other, then you should also be offended by the systemic antisemitism enacted by state government. It's ridiculous that so much attention got drawn to the tweets. The notion that anything in those tweets was antisemitic is just a way to deflect from what's really going on. A Twitter fight is not an issue. A Twitter fight doesn't lead to rabbis being killed in their home. A Twitter fight doesn't lead to communities being targeted and having their businesses closed,"" Wax said.
""The fact is, the consequences of the policies of New York leadership have been disastrous for religious Jewish communities. COVID has given the powers that be an excuse to exercise even more repressive and targeted policies. It all hearkens back to age-old antisemitic tropes that Jews are responsible for spreading disease.""
Wax, 26, said some of the issues predate the pandemic. He cited the New York State bail-reform law, which went into effect January 1, 2020 after being signed by Cuomo. It bars judges from setting bail on misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies, even when those charges are listed as hate crimes.
THE CASH-BAIL policy is part of a package of criminal-justice reform laws passed by the Democratic-controlled New York State Legislature in April 2019. The measure was criticized by some local Jewish leaders after people charged with antisemitic crimes, which spiked at the start of 2020, were released without bail before their trials.
""That was a policy that was disastrous for the security of religious Jews who suffered the biggest brunt of violence of rising crime with lack of bail,"" Wax continued. ""The [December 2019] Monsey stabbing of a prominent rabbi in his home was a horrific attack and was a direct consequence of some of the policies implemented by the Democrat-run state government.""
Nachman Mostofsky, executive director of Chovevei Zion, an organization that promotes Zionism to the American Jewish community through Torah, backed Wax's claim of antisemitism in New York State government.
He pointed to an October press conference at which Cuomo used a photo that was more than a decade old to criticize large ""gatherings, especially religious"" that broke COVID regulations. The photo showed the 2006 funeral of Satmar Rebbe Moshe Teitelbaum. A Cuomo spokesperson posted on Twitter, saying, ""This was a staff error.""
""A lot of Jews have jobs in Democrat systems. I think they need to ask themselves is it worth working for these people. [New York City] Mayor [Bill] de Blasio and Gov. Cuomo for months have blamed the Jewish community for the rise of coronavirus. I don't know a person in my community right now that has the virus, but it's spiking all around the state currently, so how come the black or Hispanic communities aren't being singled out?"" said Mostofsky, an Orthodox resident of Brooklyn's Midwood neighborhood.
""At what point do we get to call someone an antisemite? If we aren't allowed to call someone targeting our community an antisemite, then when is it OK to use the term? Where is this rulebook? Soft antisemitism leads to hard antisemitism,"" Mostofsky, 40, continued.
In an emailed statement to the Post, Cuomo spokesman Jack Sterne said, ""These claims are a tired tactic from Trump-supporting extremists to distract from the actual issue at hand: the failed federal response to COVID. Throughout this crisis, our policies have been guided by science and a desire to save lives, and anyone who says otherwise is lying. Gov. Cuomo has been a champion for Jewish New Yorkers throughout his career, and we will let his record speak for itself.
""The governor has always made clear that restrictions apply to everyone, regardless of their religion or belief,"" Sterne continued. He pointed to the governor's October 5 statement in which he said, ""Close the temples, close mosques, close schools, close Catholic churches... I want a person monitoring the attendance in a temple, in a black church, in a Catholic church.""
Sterne noted that Cuomo has traveled to Israel multiple times as governor, including trips in 2014, 2017 and 2019. In 2016, he signed a first-in-the-nation executive order directing state entities to divest all public funds supporting the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement.
Rabbi Diana Fersko, who leads The Village Temple, a Reform congregation in Manhattan, disagrees with Wax's claims of systemic antisemitism within New York's leaders. But she noted that it is important to understand where religious Jews are coming from emotionally.
""The context predates coronavirus. Jews in the US, and particularly Jews in New York, have had a horrific few years where antisemitism has been the worst it has been in maybe two decades,"" Fersko told the Post.
""It's Hanukkah time. Everyone is thinking about the Monsey stabbing that happened last Hanukkah. The hassidic community has faced the brunt of antisemitism in our community because they're easily identifiable. It's important to acknowledge the tension and fear that was there way before COVID restrictions.""
Fersko said an awareness of context helps explain the diversity of ways the Jewish community has responded to pandemic safety mandates.
""In my progressive Reform synagogue there is no discourse between what the state wants and how we want to worship,"" she said. ""We see observing COVID restrictions as part of our Jewish values. For us, there is no disconnect.
""There's such a broad range of interpretation on what are Jewish laws and values,"" Fersko continued. ""I think that's what we're dealing with here much more so than any [individual] or organization betraying Judaism.""

Video has emerged of a counter-protester splattering red paint over the Black Lives Matter mural outside Trump Tower in New York City. 
Witness Oscar Vela tweeted a clip which shows a man dressed in all black with a baseball cap, sunglasses and a face mask walking up to the mural on Fifth Avenue with a can of paint on Monday afternoon. 
The man, who has not been publicly identified, is then seen spilling globs of red paint on the word 'Lives' that was later smeared over the rest of the mural by passing cars. 
After emptying the can, the vandal picks up his things and begins running away as an onlooker calls out: 'What's your name?' and 'Run, bastard, run!' 
The defacement occurred just days after Mayor Bill de Blasio joined the community effort to paint the mural in large yellow letters last Thursday. 
De Blasio hit out at the person responsible on Monday night, tweeting: 'To whoever vandalized our mural on 5th Avenue: nice try @NYCDOT has already fixed it.'
'The #BlackLivesMatter movement is more than words, and it can't be undone,' the mayor added. 
Authorities said the man dumped the paint just after noon on Monday and then fled on East 56th Street before officers could catch up with him. 
Detectives are now reviewing surveillance footage and asked the public to contact them with any information about the vandal. 
Crews began repainting the mural hours later and managed to erase all signs of the red paint. 
Trump Tower has been the site of dozens of protests since Donald Trump was elected - including one on Saturday where anti-racism protests clashed with the president's supporters at the new mural. 
One of the witnesses to Monday's defacement was a man wearing and selling 'Dump Trump' gear on the street. 
He was pictured standing nearby a man holding up a sign seemingly intended to gaslight people highlighting racial inequalities. It read: 'The only time black lives matter is when they are shot by a white policeman or an Oreo cookie. Defend all policemen.'
An 'Oreo' is a derogatory term used against people of color, comparing them to the cookie which is classically brown on the outside and white on the inside. The slur suggests the person exhibits behavior that the person judging aligns with being characteristically white. 
The Black Lives Matter mural outside Trump Tower was one of five that de Blasio promised to paint across New York City last month as part of an initiative to honor civil rights activists.
'When we say ""Black Lives Matter"", there is no more American statement, there is no more patriotic statement because there is no America without Black America,' the mayor said at the time. 
'We are acknowledging the truth of ourselves as Americans by saying ""Black Lives Matter"". We are righting a wrong.' 
Trump expressed his opposition to the mural earlier this month, saying it would denigrate the luxury shopping area. He also said it would 'further antagonize New York's finest'. 
 'Maybe our GREAT Police, who have been neutralized and scorned by a mayor who hates & disrespects them, won't let this symbol of hate be affixed to New York's greatest street,' Trump tweeted on July 1. 
But police appeared to ignore the president's remarks and were seen protecting the people painting the mural from counter-protesters on Thursday. 
Black Lives Matter murals in other cities have been similarly defaced in recent weeks, including in Chicago, Milwaukee and Washington, DC. 
Last week a couple in Martinez, California, were charged with a hate crime after they destroyed a mural there. 
'We must address the root and byproduct of systemic racism in our country. The Black Lives Matter movement is an important civil rights cause that deserves all of our attention,' Contra Costa District Attorney Diana Becton said in a statement announcing the charges against David Nelson and Nicole Anderson. 
'The mural completed last weekend was a peaceful and powerful way to communicate the importance of Black lives in Contra Costa County and the country. We must continue to elevate discussions and actually listen to one another in an effort to heal our community and country.' 
The decision to paint the murals came as Americans across the country expressed their hurt at statues and memorials to Confederate soldiers and slave-owners that have loomed over public places for decades.

 As some U.S. politicians are bent on politicizing the pandemic and maliciously making China a scapegoat for their incompetence in containing the outbreak, the virus of racial discrimination against Asian Americans is also spreading across the country.
 Asian Americans are frequently humiliated and even attacked in public, and suffering continuous discrimination on social media platforms.
 The racial group faced a double whammy of unemployment and discrimination amid the outbreak, according to many reports recently released by American research institutions and civil society organizations.
 However, some U.S. officials have played dumb about the situation, which has fully revealed the hypocrisy and cruelty of the so-called American human rights.
 Relevant data have been rather dreadful. Racial discrimination against Asian Americans is becoming more common, pointed out a survey report from American think tank Pew Research Center.
 31 percent of Asian Americans said they have been subject to racist slurs or jokes since the pandemic began, while 26 percent said they’ve feared someone might physically attack them, the survey found.
 As the number of racist attacks against Asian Americans in various areas of New York has increased significantly, the New York City Police Department has even established an Asian Hate Crime Task Force recently, the first task force in the U.S. that is aimed at Asian hate crimes.
 Across the country, Asian American health-care workers have reported a rise in bigoted incidents, according to an article published on The Washington Post.
 The racial hostility has left Asian Americans, who represent 6 percent of the U.S. population but 18 percent of the country’s physicians and 10 percent of its nurse practitioners, in a painful position on the front lines of the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the article said.
 “Some COVID-19 patients refuse to be treated by them. And when doctors and nurses leave the hospital, they face increasing harassment in their daily lives, too,” it continued.
 What lies at the root of such pernicious consequences is certain U.S. politicians’ misdeed of spreading “political virus”.
 Some U.S. officials have taken every opportunity and played every trick they can to attack and stigmatize China, including calling the COVID-19 “Chinese virus” and “Wuhan virus”, which has fostered extremism and racism in the U.S. and become the main culprit of the dramatically increasing attacks and threats targeting Asian Americans.
 The attacks and smear campaign launched against China by some American politicians have ignited anti-Asian sentiment, according to an article published by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).
 “Yet public figures and politicians play a key role in promoting racial equality and non-discrimination principles. In this regards, it is dismaying to witness State officials adopting alternative named for the COVID-19 coronavirus,” said Tendayi Achiume, the United Nations (UN) Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.
 “Indeed, instead of using the internationally recognized name of the virus, these (U.S.) officials have adopted names with geographic references, typically referring to its emergence in China. This sort of calculated use of a geographic-based name for this virus is rooted in and fosters racism and xenophobia,” she pointed out in a recent statement.
 Systemic racism is a malady afflicting the American society.
 Color has obviously played a major role in determining the fate of many Americans, U.S. scholar Thomas Sowell wrote in his book Ethnic America: A History.
 In history, the notorious Chinese Exclusion Act and crimes against Asian Americans such as sending a large number of Asians to concentration camps during the World War II have startled the world.
 Asian Americans now still suffer continuous harassment, exclusion and structural discrimination in the U.S., arousing great concern among the international community and American people with breadth of vision.
 This year, the special procedures of the U.N. Human Rights Council have repeatedly condemned the U.S. for its racial discrimination and hate speech.
 Recent hate crimes and violent assaults against people of Asian descent should sound an alarm for America, said nearly 200 American foreign policy scholars and former diplomats in a joint statement issued on USA Today.
 They called upon U.S. leaders at every level and in every sector to take action against anti-Asian racism and express support for Asian diaspora and Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities.
 Only those who lack competence themselves would deliberately invent divisions and confrontations against others.
 The conflicts and antagonisms in the American society won’t stop worsening unless certain U.S. officials break off the political scheme to pass the buck to China for their misconduct in dealing with the epidemic.
 Otherwise, other groups of people, in addition to Asian Americans, may end up a new victim of some U.S. officials.
 In the U.S., a country that claims to be a “beacon of freedom”, some U.S. politicians, however, have ignored the international human rights law, openly incited and condoned racial discrimination, and violated the bottom line of human civilization by blatantly trampling on human rights, which is by no means tolerable.

The Senate on Wednesday unanimously passed a bill that would, for the first time, explicitly make lynching a federal crime.
“For over a century, members of Congress have attempted to pass some version of a bill that would recognize lynching for what it is: a bias-motivated act of terror,” Senator Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat who introduced the bill, said in a statement. “Today, we have righted that wrong and taken corrective action that recognizes this stain on our country’s history.”
More than 4,700 people, the vast majority of them black, were lynched in the United States between 1882 and 1968, according to the N.A.A.C.P. Perpetrators were rarely prosecuted. Congress has tried and failed some 200 times to pass similar anti-lynching legislation since 1882, according to the bill.
The bill, titled the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act of 2018, was introduced in June by the Senate’s three black members: Kamala Harris, a California Democrat; Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican; and Mr. Booker. A spokeswoman for Ms. Harris said her office was trying to get the House to schedule a vote on the bill before Congress adjourns this week.
“Lynchings were needless and horrendous acts of violence that were motivated by racism,” Ms. Harris said in a statement. “And we must acknowledge that fact, lest we repeat it.”
If the bill is enacted, it would explicitly add a section titled “lynching” to federal civil rights law, stating that if two or more people kill someone because of that person’s race or religion, they can be sentenced up to life in prison if convicted.
That addition is largely symbolic, said Brian Levin, director at the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. He said such violence could already be considered a federal or state-level hate crime, and the perpetrators could also face other charges, such as murder.
“The fact that the law would still even have the possibility of not fully addressing this is outrageous,” he said. “It should have been done a long time ago.”
Frank Pezzella, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said the bill’s passage also carries a message of deterrence — that lynching or actions similar to it will not be tolerated by society. Reported hate crimes rose for the third consecutive year in 2017, according to the F.B.I.
“It was taken for granted in the South that whites could use force against any African-Americans who became overbearing,” he said. “How do we connect that with hate crimes in the present? Hate offenders really want to kind of go back to that place.”
The bill comes as the country has increasingly confronted the history of lynching.
In 2005, the Senate agreed to apologize to the victims of lynching and their descendants for its failure to pass anti-lynching legislation.
A large memorial for lynching victims, the National Memorial for Peace and Justice, opened in April, in Montgomery, Ala. It features a walkway with 800 worn steel columns hanging from the roof, engraved with the names of people who were lynched.
Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith, Republican of Mississippi, received fierce criticism last month when she said at a campaign event, while praising a cattle rancher, that if he invited her to a “public hanging” she would be in the front row. Her Democratic opponent, Mike Espy, who is black, said the comments were “awful.”
Ms. Hyde-Smith happened to be the presiding officer in the Senate when the anti-lynching bill was passed on Wednesday.

Unfortunately for Cuomo, however, he ended up with egg on his face after the truth behind the noose later came out. It all started last Saturday when someone snapped a photo in Marcus Garvey Park in Harlem of what was quickly dubbed a 'noose' that appeared to be hanging from a tree near the historic Fire Watch Tower, according to WNBC-TV[1]. Without waiting to get the facts behind what the rope could be, Cuomo was quick to use the noose to fuel his radical anti-American agenda. 
More from Wayne Dupree'I am disgusted by the recent discovery of a noose — the epitome of hatred and an evil icon of our nation's racist past — in Harlem's Marcus Garvey Park,' Cuomo said in a statement released on Tuesday.

Darrell Wallace Jr. said he was relieved to hear the F.B.I. say he had not been the target of a hate crime at Talladega Superspeedway last weekend, after a noose hanging in his garage stall was found to have been there since at least last fall.
In a statement on Twitter on Wednesday, Wallace, known as Bubba, thanked NASCAR and the F.B.I. for taking the threat seriously. “We’ll gladly take a little embarrassment over what the alternatives could have been,” said Wallace, the sole black driver in NASCAR’s top series.
The national turmoil over race and serial injustice has complicated both Wallace’s reaction and the public’s response to the F.B.I.’s findings. With the government’s investigation closed and no charges filed, Wallace has found himself all but forced to defend himself from baseless speculation that he or his supporters staged the incident to garner publicity.
While NASCAR characterized the noose as a pull rope for a garage door that was “fashioned like a noose,” some people insisted the noose was just a rope with a handle, and that Wallace and stock-car racing executives had overreacted. Wallace said Wednesday on NBC’s “Today” show that he considered the knot to be a noose that someone took time to create at the end of a door pull. Though the noose was not functional, he said, the sight of it “makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up.”
The debate over the episode was hardly deterred by the timeline of the case, the Justice Department’s conclusions or the history of a sport that long has battled racism both inside and outside of the garage, including by fans who proudly flew the Confederate flag at competitions until Wallace called for NASCAR to ban it on June 8. NASCAR barred the battle flag two days later.
Wallace wasn’t the first person to notice the noose in his garage, or even the fourth. The accounts of Wallace and others within NASCAR indicated that he was at least the fifth person to be made aware of the noose after it was found on Sunday, and that he first learned about it from Steve Phelps, NASCAR’s president.
According to racing officials, a member of Wallace’s crew noticed the suspicious rope and reported it to Jerry Baxter, the crew chief and a fixture of the sport. Baxter alerted Jay Fabian, a senior NASCAR official. Ultimately, Phelps met Wallace at the driver’s motor home and tearfully told him what had been found.
F.B.I. agents traveled to Talladega, less than an hour’s drive from Birmingham, and began reviewing evidence. A crucial clue was an assertion on Monday morning by an employee of Wood Brothers Racing, another NASCAR team, that he had noticed the tied rope at a race last fall, long before Wallace had been assigned to the garage stall for this week’s Geico 500.
Through a spokeswoman, the United States attorney for the Northern District of Alabama, Jay E. Town, declined to be interviewed on Wednesday. But the Justice Department said Tuesday that officials were certain that the noose had been in the garage since at least October, and that “nobody could have known Mr. Wallace would be assigned to garage No. 4” that far in advance.
“The 43 team had nothing to do with this,” Phelps said in a teleconference, referring to Wallace’s Richard Petty Motorsports team. He said that NASCAR was still investigating who might have tied the noose last year, or perhaps even earlier.
Hate crime hoaxes are extraordinarily rare. Just 11 of more than 7,000 reported hate crimes in 2018 turned out to be deliberately false reports, according to data compiled by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. But researchers said that when potential hate crimes, reported in good faith, are found not to have been plainly motivated by bias or malevolence, observers are often quick to react with skepticism — and sometimes false arguments — particularly online.
“We are now in a world today where conspiracy theories have greater currency than facts and patience,” said Brian Levin, a former New York City police officer who is now the director of the San Bernardino center. “This has become a game of gotcha rather than an earnest search for truth.”
There was good reason for Wallace and his team to be sensitive to anything that could be perceived as racist. His own parents were concerned for his safety after he spoke out this month, saying the Confederate flag was a symbol of hate, and not heritage. Those safety concerns were focused on the reaction of fans in the predominantly white sport, but history has shown that racism also exists inside the stock-car circuit.
In early 1999, David Scott, one of two black crew members in NASCAR, described in a news report that other crew members often called him names like Leroy and Lemont, and also called him racial slurs.
“I expected that coming here,” Scott, who drove the motor home for a top owner, told The Orlando Sentinel. “I just figure that’s the way it is.”
That harassment culminated with an incident in July 1999 at New Hampshire Motor Speedway, according to a lawsuit Scott filed against NASCAR in 2006. Two white employees of top NASCAR drivers showed up at the door of his motor home, and one had pulled a pillowcase over his head to impersonate a Ku Klux Klan member, the suit said. When Scott opened the door, the two men screamed.
One of the men said, “Hey, Scotty, we wanted to light the grass on fire so it would give it a better effect.” About 10 other motor home drivers witnessed the incident and laughed, the lawsuit said. Scott feared for his life.
“What happened with Bubba is bringing back a lot of bad memories for both of us,” Scott said on Wednesday, adding that his wife, Deirdre, worked for NASCAR in the licensing department until 2003. “We’ve lost a lot of sleep over the last few days.”
The two white men involved in the incident were fired, and NASCAR reminded teams that it had a zero-tolerance policy for racism. Scott’s lawsuit in 2006 claimed that the association had not given him a job he had been promised, which was supposed to protect him from the harassment he had faced working for a team in the garage area. A judge dismissed the case in 2008, the same year NASCAR settled a separate lawsuit involving the first black woman to work as a NASCAR technical official.
That official, Mauricia Grant, sued NASCAR for $225 million for racial discrimination, sexual harassment and wrongful termination. In her lawsuit, Grant, who went by the first name Mo, said she endured “virulently racist comments” and “ugly racist bigotry” by co-workers who called her names like “Nappy Headed Mo,” “Mohammed” and “Simpleton.” Some fellow officials discussed the Ku Klux Klan, she said, and it scared her. Her colleagues often made her work outside, the suit said, telling her that she would not sunburn because she was black, and would say she was “on colored-people time” if she was late.
Grant, who didn’t respond to messages, once rode in a car with another official at Talladega who told her to duck. According to court documents, he said, “I don’t want to start a riot when these fans see a black woman in my car.” Another official at Talladega, according to the lawsuit, “jokingly” threatened to sic the garage’s bomb-sniffing dog on Grant because she could be perceived as a criminal.
While Wallace hasn’t directly faced similar daily racism within NASCAR, he has acknowledged that whatever he does or says will be placed under a microscope and criticized by fans who might not want him to be in the sport. While enduring the backlash from the noose episode, he has had to remind himself that he can’t please everybody.
“I will always have haters,” Wallace said on CNN.

In exaggerated tones, Ms. Cooper, who is white, told operators that ""an African-American man is threatening me and my dog,"" and asked police to come immediately.
Fairminded observers could see she was weaponizing race. They understood her complaint risked having cops rush in, armed, to confront the birdwatcher, a conflict that could end tragically.
But a moral crime is not necessarily a legal one, which is what Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance wants to make it. Monday, Vance slapped Ms. Cooper with a misdemeanor charge of filing a false report.
Unlike cases where a person created a fake hate-crime out of whole cloth, words were exchanged between the Coopers.
On Facebook, Mr. Cooper described chastising Ms. Cooper for letting her dog run off-leash. When she ignored him, he says he told her, ""Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it."" He then tried to lure the dog with treats.
Ms. Cooper properly became a pariah. She also lost her job. Mr. Cooper thinks she's suffered enough. It's a heavy lift to convict when doing so requires proving an intent to fabricate.

The Democrat-led Legislature approved the long-stalled reform of the statute - which is routinely used to keep the public from learning about police misconduct and disciplinary actions taken against officers - in response to protests sparked by the death of George Floyd, a black Minnesota man who was killed when a white police officer kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes.
""The silver lining on this incredibly dark cloud is that the sun is finally starting to shine on injustice. Maybe it's the unmistakable, and in my opinion disputable, video evidence that we saw a live murder on TV, but it's done something to the consciousness of America,"" said bill sponsor Sen. Jamaal Bailey (D-Bronx) in an emotional floor speech before the bill passed. ""I don't know if there could be a more meaningful piece of legislation for me and this body because it's way more than just policy.
""There's a time to not only correct what we thought and knew to be a flaw in the state law, but to correct misconceptions that many of us have carried for too long for things that we can never experience,"" he added.
The bill passed along party lines in the Senate, 40-22, with all Republicans voting against the measure. The Assembly approved the measure 101-43 Tuesday evening, also along party lines.
Since 1976, the statute has prevented the personnel and disciplinary records of any police officer, corrections officer or firefighter from being made public. The NYPD only started adhering to the statute in 2016, when the department abruptly stopped allowing media and the public to see the outcomes of administrative trials. The courts have repeatedly bolstered the more expansive interpretation of the law.
The law became a point of contention following the 2014 chokehold death of Eric Garner at the hands of then-NYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo, whose disciplinary record was shielded in secrecy.
Advocates, including New Yorkers United for Justice, and legal organizations such as the Legal Aid Society and the New York Civil Liberties Union, have pushed for the repeal of 50-a in the name of transparency.
""Our criminal justice system, in order to build and maintain public trust, must be transparent,"" said United for Justice chief strategist Khalil Cumberbatch. ""Even more so as it relates to law enforcement agencies - and that means accountability and public scrutiny for police.""
Former NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill conceded that ""the law must change"" after an independent panel, comprised of two former prosecutors and a former judge, released a report last year that found ""almost a complete lack of transparency and public accountability.""
""It is an attempt to level the playing field, it is an attempt to get information into the public,"" said sponsor Assemblyman Daniel O'Donnell (D-Manhattan), who has championed the bill for several years. ""We take one step forward today on transparency. We allow people some degree of peace.""
Police unions have vehemently argued against changing the law. A coalition of law enforcement groups said in a statement Monday that releasing records, including complaints, could leave officers facing ""unavoidable and irreparable harm to reputation and livelihood.""
However, the legislation provides officers with some privacy protections, redacting home addresses, phone numbers and email addresses.
""We, as professionals, are under assault,"" Patrick Lynch, the president of the Police Benevolent Association, representing rank-and-file NYPD officers, said during a press conference earlier Tuesday. ""And this in a backdrop of a night when we had seven shootings (in Brooklyn) in seven minutes.""
The bill makes police disciplinary records subject to Freedom of Information Law requests, similar to most records kept by public agencies. It is part of a package of police reform bills that the Legislature began voting on Monday.
The slate includes a bill making it a hate crime to call 911 and make a false claim based on a person's race, and another codifying into law the state attorney general's power to appoint a special prosecutor when someone is killed by police.
Other changes ban chokeholds under the so-called ""Eric Garner Act"" and mandate police departments to provide medical training to officers. Garner died after being put in a chokehold by cops on Staten Island in 2014.
Senate Republican Leader John Flanagan (R-Nassau) railed against Democrats, accusing them of attempting to ""sow division"" under the guise of justice and civil rights.
""The brutal killing of George Floyd is a horrific tragedy that never should have occurred. There is simply no place in our society for police brutality, and whenever it does occur those responsible must be held accountable,"" he said. ""But it is not a reason to vilify and punish every man and woman in law enforcement who serves to protect and serve our communities in New York, nor should it be a reason to sow division.""
Gov. Cuomo has vowed to sign the legislation, calling Floyd's death the ""tipping point"" of a change that has been ""brewing for decades, if not centuries."""

A Louisiana man has been accused of fatally shooting an unarmed panhandler.
Boyd, who is white, was arrested August 27 and charged with second-degree murder in the death 61-year-old black man Danny Buckley. 
Jace Boyd, 24, was released from jail on bond Thursday, a week after his arrest and public outcry over the shooting. 
Boyd posted $300,000 bond and was released Thursday, news outlets reported.
An arrest warrant said Buckley was panhandling in the Trader Joe's parking lot at an upscale shopping center when he approached Boyd's car to ask for money.
Baton Rouge police said the pair got into a 'verbal dispute,' which escalated after Buckley walked away to ask a woman for money.
Police said Boyd yelled at Buckley to 'leave people alone because he was scaring them' and when Buckley turned to Boyd, Boyd reached into his car for his gun.
The warrant said Boyd fired at Buckley but the gun misfired. Boyd reloaded the gun, put a new bullet in the chamber and shot Buckley in the abdomen, the warrant continued. Police said Buckley was out of reach.
Boyd called police and admitted to shooting Buckley, but he was not arrested because he told police it was self-defense.
Boyd was arrested a few days later after East Baton Rouge Mayor-President Sharon Weston Broome asked for 'a fair and transparent review of what happened.'
Attorneys for Buckley's family said the shooting constitutes a hate crime. They also asked whether police would have handled the case differently is the races were reversed.
Shane Hinch, a lawyer who said he was initially contacted by Mr. Boyd's parents, said that Mr. Boyd maintained the shooting was justified.
In a statement to the New York Times, Mr Hinch said: 'I can say without equivocation that despite reports, Jace at all times felt that both himself and his fiancée as well as another woman were in immediate threat of great bodily harm and that he acted in self-defense and defense of others.' "

An 18-year-old Muslim woman was arrested during a recent Black Lives Matter protest in the United States and was forced to remove her hijab for a booking photo, and she was not allowed to put it back on for several hours, an advocacy group has said.
Alaa Massri was among the protesters who were protesting at the site of two statues of Christopher Columbus and Juan Ponce de León near Bayside Market in Miami on June 10, The New York Times reported quoting the Miami Police Department.
During the demonstration, police officers established a ""skirmish line"" to prevent protesters from ""taking over the street,"" according to the police. The police claimed that Massri ""became irate"" as an officer ""was guiding her up the street,"" adding that the officer ""grabbed"" her after she ""continued to remain in the roadway"" and that she punched the officer ""in the right bicep with a closed fist.""
Massri was arrested and charged with battery, resisting an officer with violence and disorderly conduct.
She was taken to a Miami-Dade County Corrections and Rehabilitation center where officers removed her hijab forcibly, according to Hassan Shibly, the chief executive director of CAIR Florida, a civil liberties and advocacy organization.
""She was wrongfully and unconstitutionally photographed without her hijab, and it was made accessible to countless media outlets,"" he said

He said that removing religious head coverings during booking procedures — whether a hijab, yumalke, or turban — is a ""severe violation of religious freedoms,"" NVS News reported.
""It's not isolated. We've heard it before, and there have been lawsuits filed across the nation to rule this practice as unconstitutional,"" Saleh said, citing a few jurisdictions in California and Portland, Maine.
""This isn't treatment that's unique to Muslims, but it's one where Muslim women who wear hijabs certainly bear the brunt of,"" Saleh said. ""There needs to be change.""
A Muslim woman filed a federal civil lawsuit in Yonkers, New York, in April where she said she was forced to remove her hijab before taking her booking photo last year.
Ihsan Malkawai was arrested on ""false allegations of abuse,"" which were later came out unfounded. She was kept in custody without her hijab for 36 hours.

The F.B.I. is investigating a confrontation between a Black man and a group of white men who pinned him against a tree at an Indiana lake over the Fourth of July weekend, after video of the episode drew broad condemnation.
Lauren Hagee Glintz, a spokeswoman for the F.B.I., confirmed the investigation on Wednesday morning, but declined to provide any further comment. 
Vauhxx Booker, a member of the Monroe County Human Rights Commission in Bloomington, Ind., said on Facebook that the men assaulted him and threatened to “get a noose.” He said that he and his friends had gathered to watch the lunar eclipse at Lake Monroe, a large beach near Bloomington that is about 60 miles south of Indianapolis.
As videos of the confrontation spread online, they drew outrage from officials and in part motivated a protest in the city on Monday night. A driver of a red Toyota accelerated into a crowd of protesters that night, injuring at least two; the police were searching for the driver on Tuesday.
The incident near Lake Monroe began when a group of white men told Mr. Booker and his friends that they were on private property, he said on Facebook.
Part of the confrontation was captured on a cellphone video that Mr. Booker posted online. The video shows one man holding Mr. Booker against a tree as several others surround him. Bystanders can be heard calling for them to let him go.
“I was attacked by five white men,” Mr. Booker said in the post, “who literally threatened to lynch me in front of numerous witnesses.” He said he had heard the men say “get a noose” and use racial slurs.
Mr. Booker said that bystanders eventually got the men to stop and that he and his friends left the area and called the authorities. In another video, the men can be seen following Mr. Booker and his friends, accusing them of trespassing and berating them with profanity.
In his Facebook post, Mr. Booker said he had a minor concussion, some abrasions, bruising and loss of hair from having been pulled.
Katharine Liell, Mr. Booker’s lawyer, said at a news conference this week that the F.B.I. was investigating the case as a possible hate crime.
“We want this investigated as a hate crime, it was clearly racially motivated,” she said, speaking outside the Monroe County courthouse. “We welcome this inquiry and feel we are one step closer to justice,” she added on Facebook.
Mr. Booker and his lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment.
The Indiana Department of Natural Resources, which manages Lake Monroe, is also investigating the incident, James Brindle, a spokesman for the department, said on Wednesday. No arrests have been made, and an incident report was not immediately available.
“Our conservation officers are working with the Monroe County prosecutor’s office,” Mr. Brindle said. Lake Monroe sits on land owned by the Army Corps of Engineers, private owners and the Hoosier National Forest, he said, adding that the state leases land from the corps for recreational purposes.
Mr. Booker spoke at the news conference, addressing a crowd of supporters with signs that read “Black Lives Matter.”
“We’re not a community where you can lynch someone in the street,” he said. “We are a community that is welcoming or inclusive, and we are going to make sure that justice is served.”
In a statement, Mayor John Hamilton of Bloomington and the city clerk, Nicole Bolden, condemned the confrontation, saying that a group “physically assaulted and denounced and threatened with racial epithets one Black resident of Bloomington.”
They also condemned another incident, in which a sheriff’s deputy of a neighboring county questioned and detained a Black resident who was walking down the street “in an apparent example of racial profiling.”
“We would like to express outrage and grief relating to two apparent racially motivated incidents reported in our community,’’ the statement said. “These separate incidents exemplify the persistence of racism and bias in our country and our own community. They deserve nothing less than our collective condemnation.”
State Senator Mark Stoops, whose district includes most of Monroe County, also said he was “horrified to hear about this racist attack” at the lake.
“This is not just an issue of violence; this is clearly a hate crime and must be treated as such,” he said in a statement.
The senator said that officers with the Department of Natural Resources “had clear evidence that a crime had been committed” in the videos, and that they should have taken “immediate corrective action.” He called for Gov. Eric Holcomb to immediately suspend the officers involved.

Aired 8-9p ET",FALSE,"ERIN BURNETT, CNN HOST: All right. And let's hand it off now to Anderson.
[20:00:16]
ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST: Good evening. For a second time in just the few days, the President held a large indoor gathering in the middle of a coronavirus hot zone. This time at a Megachurch in Phoenix which enticed people to come by promising a new air purifier they installed would kill the virus and keep people safe.
That actually happened. It's called the Dream City Church.
Here in the real world, doctors and scientists called BS on the miracle purifier, and that's really where we begin. Keeping them honest with the clash between the reality of where we are with this virus that's killed more than 121,000 Americans, and it's not even July and the alternative reality that the President is inhabiting or wishes he was inhabiting.
In the real world, Arizona is right now experiencing the kind of steep growth in cases you once saw in New York at the beginning of the outbreak. Look at that chart, and here's the growth and the number of people sick enough to be hospitalized. Again, not a good sign.
Arizona is hardly alone. Look at Texas, new cases rising there just as sharply and again, not just for more testing. So many people are getting sick that in Houston, Texas Children's Hospital tells CNN it's providing additional ICU and acute care beds now for adults.
The Governor, Greg Abbott, a staunch supporter of the President is telling Texans that the safest place to be right now is at home. And on a global scale, the European Union is now weighing the possibility of banning travel from the U.S.
Just think about that -- because of the way America has handled, this administration has handled the coronavirus pandemic, Americans may not be allowed to fly to Europe, by the Europeans.
Going by the data, it's hard not to see why. I mean, look at the comparison between the E.U. and the U.S. since the pandemic began. The United States -- we're the green line. The United States not only has not gotten the virus under control, it's now backsliding toward 30,000 new cases a day. The white line, that's the European Union.
In the fantasy world meantime, the President goes straight into the middle of one of the hardest hit states, not to visit patients or doctors or nurses or EMTs; instead, he first visits the border wall, then goes to get a dose of self-gratification, his own favorite medicine, other than hydroxychloroquine at a Megachurch where the Pastor has promised a miracle device will keep folks safe.
And in this House of God, he again uses a racist slur to describe the virus.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It has so many names, I could give you 19 or 20 names for that, right. It's got all different names -- Wuhan -- now Wuhan was catching on -- coronavirus, right? Kung Flu. COVID -- COVID-19 -- COVID. I say what's the 19? COVID-19, some people can't explain what the 19. Give me the -- COVID- 19, I said that's an odd name.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
COOPER: Meantime back in the real world, Dr. Fauci and other members of the once visible Coronavirus Taskforce that has now become invisible much -- they are like the coronavirus. They're invisible. To lawmakers, it's been weeks since they've spoken to the President.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
QUESTION: Dr. Fauci, when was the last time you spoke to the President?
DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: About two and a half weeks ago.
QUESTION: Admiral Giroir, when was the last time you spoke to the President?
ADMIRAL BRETT GIROIR, H.H.S. ASSISTANT SECRETARY: It was about two and a half weeks ago as well, maybe three weeks ago.
QUESTION: Honorable Hahn, when the last time you spoke to the President about the pandemic and the response?
DR. STEPHEN HAHN, COMMISSIONER, FOOD AND DRUGS ADMINISTRATION: It's been some time since I spoke about the pandemic response.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
COOPER: C.D.C. Director Robert Redfield, who you saw there not saying anything. He declined to answer that question -- when was the last time you saw the President? It really does make you wonder, though.
I mean, it was pretty clear Trump didn't like him even when the Taskforce was having daily briefings. He didn't get a lot of chances to talk. He usually just kind of sat off on the sidelines. But Redfield won't say when he last spoke to the President. The others had no problem admitting yes, two or two and a half weeks, which isn't good. I mean, Redfield is kind of then be much longer than that.
Now, remember, the Coronavirus Taskforce, which the Vice President always used to make sure to point out did everything quote-unquote, ""at the direction of the President,"" the he Coronavirus Taskforce which is now, as I said, as invisible as the virus itself, the Taskforce still recommends mask wearing, more testing for the disease, social distancing, staying away from enclosed spaces and big crowds.
You see them testifying. They had the mask on. Sometimes they took them off just to speak, then they put them right back on.
But the President is doing everything he can to subvert all those people you just saw, the nation's top scientists. He shut down the daily briefings after being ridiculed for suggesting experimenting on injecting people with disinfectant.
So he shuts the briefings down so Americans won't hear as much about the virus because the President believes if you don't hear about it as much, you'll forget about it.
[20:05:14]
COOPER: And about the Federal government's incompetent response. So, just forget it. You'll move on. It seems so old. And sure your dad may die, your grandmother might get sick or she might die, you might get sick, you might die. But so be it.
The President is actively working to turn people against all the other recommendations of the Taskforce he once claimed to lead, wearing masks, social distancing, not congregating in giant indoor stadiums with thousands of others or Megachurches.
Of course, behind the scenes, the President has gotten more tests for the virus than probably anyone else in this country, if not in the world. And everyone in the White House who makes contact with the President is tested and has their temperature checked. Publicly, he is pretending this virus has passed. Privately, he is living in a biological bunker.
He visited the underground bunker. He was taken there one Friday, rushed there by the Secret Service. He denies that, but he lives every day in a biological bunker. People being tested around him. Everyone is wearing masks, having their temperature checked.
He is as sanitized and protected from the virus as anyone can be and in the midst of that epicenter of sanitation, he is encouraging everyone else -- don't follow the guidelines.
Publicly, he is flouting all of those guidelines, except the one about hand washing. He is washing his hands of all of it. Worse than that, worse even than modeling bad behavior, he has been creating a string of distractions that are taking up precious bandwidth that have nothing to do with slowing down the virus and saving lives. Oh, and he has been boasting of course that he ordered to slow down the testing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: So, I said to my people, slow the testing down, please. They test, and they test. We ought to test the people -- I don't know what's going on. We've got to test. We got another one over here.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
COOPER: He said that on Saturday, and yesterday, his spokesperson said look, he was only joking, of course.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KAYLEIGH, MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: It was a comment that he made in jest. It's a comment that he made in passing, specifically with regard to the media coverage and pointing out the fact that the media never acknowledges that we have more cases because when you test more people, you find more cases.
QUESTION: Is it appropriate to joke about coronavirus when 120,000 people have died?
MCENANY: He was not joking about coronavirus.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
COOPER: Miss McEnany is now learning, like all spokespeople for this President, that when you go out on a limb for DJT, he will cut the limb off behind you. He does it every time.
Shortly after McEnany said that, the President suggested that no, he wasn't joking, speaking to a local reporter, and he made it completely clear to a CBS News correspondent today.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
QUESTION: Mr. President, at that rally, when you said you asked your people to slow down testing, were you just kidding or do you have a plan to slow down testing?
TRUMP: I don't get it. Let me just tell you, let me make it clear. We have got the greatest testing program anywhere in the world. We test better than anybody in the world. Our tests are the best in the world, and we have the most of them.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
COOPER: So okay, he says he wasn't joking, never mind what his spokesperson said. He wasn't joking when he asked -- when he said that he asked to slow the testing.
Now, of course Taskforce members were asked about this claim today, and they said they didn't know anything about it.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
FAUCI: To my knowledge, none of us have ever been told to slow down on testing. That just is a fact. In fact, we will be doing more testing.
DR. ROBERT REDFIELD, DIRECTOR, C.D.C.: As Dr. Fauci said, all of us have been and continue to be committed to increasing readily timely access to testing. We've made a marked improvement.
REP. GREG WALDEN (D-OR): Let me go straight to the question that my colleague asked. I'll just ask each of you for a yes or no answer, has President Trump ever directed you to slow down testing for COVID-19 in the United States? Dr. Redfield?
REDFIELD: No. No, sir.
QUESTION: No Congressman.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
COOPER: Dr. Redfield seems unfamiliar with the mask there. I don't know. So maybe he said it to someone else. He does after all tend to repeat himself somewhat frequently, or maybe he never said it, but just made it up. And now he is sticking by the lie because that he thinks it makes him look tough. And they, you know, they loved it.
So likely by tomorrow, he's going to contradict himself, so you know, who really cares? Who jokes about slowing testing for a deadly virus?
I mean, the President has done some standup trying to do bits of the laugh shack on a Tuesday night at 1:00 a.m. testing out new material. There's nothing funny about it when the guy who is joking about slowing down testing is the guy who has the power to slow down testing.
And the same guy who does not like a lot of testing because then you know how far the virus has actually spread. And he believes it makes him look bad. It doesn't make people who test positive any less sick or some any less dead, but it does make him look bad, he believes and he has said so openly time and time again.
[20:10:04]
TRUMP: We have so much testing. I don't think you need that kind of testing or that much testing.
We've done more testing than every other country combined. So in a way, by doing all of this testing, we make ourselves look bad.
I've always said testing is somewhat overrated.
Something can happen between the test where it's good, and then something happens, and all of a sudden --
This is why the whole concept of tests aren't necessarily great.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
COOPER: Again, it seems normal, I guess, after a while, but I mean, just we've got a pandemic -- global pandemic going on. More than 100,000 Americans dead, not even beginning July, and this is what we've got.
So, this is where we begin the program tonight. Testing and the state of the virus and the President complaining as he does throughout every day about how badly he is being treated.
After trying to draft off the popularity of Dr. Anthony Fauci by hijacking the Coronavirus Taskforce briefings and then destroying them. Now, the President is trying to bask in the glimmering glow of the scientists he no longer wants you to hear from, quoting now from the presidential tweet today, ""Dr. Anthony Fauci who is with us in all ways, a very high 72 percent approval rating."" How does he know this? Why does he pay attention to this?
We know why. Because this is all he cares about -- the numbers, his numbers, how he is doing, who else is popular. He has got to get rid of that person. The tweet continues, ""So if he (Dr. Fauci) is in charge, along with the VP et cetera, and with us doing all these really good things, why doesn't the lame stream media treat us as they should? Answer: Because they are fake news.""
So much to tweet, so little time. Joining us now is Dr. Richard Besser, former Acting Director of the C.D.C. and currently President and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation; also with us, CNN chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta.
Dr. Besser, we heard from Dr. Fauci and other public health officials today, warning that the cases are going up. We all need to wear masks, avoid big gatherings, increase testing.
I mean, as somebody who has been -- who has run the C.D.C. and knows how difficult it is to run a public health campaign and get a population to abide by, you know, guidelines, which are restrictive and difficult and wearing a mask is unpleasant. It's got to be -- I mean, have you -- could you ever imagine a situation where there would be a pandemic, and the leader of the country would be subverting the very guidelines, the top scientists are pleading with people to do?
DR. RICHARD BESSER, FORMER ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE C.D.C.: Yes, you know, Anderson, this is a really, really troubling situation. When I think back to where we were several months ago, there was some unity of messaging about how serious the pandemic was, and that we needed to take action.
But right now, we're in a situation where we have such incredible mixed messaging. We have every public health leader in the nation, the majority of political leaders in the nation saying that this is a serious situation and we need to take action, but at the top and in other quarters in some states, we are hearing people say, go back to work, go back to your social life. Don't worry about this, the virus is under control.
And without that unity of purpose, without everyone aligning behind doing the right thing, we are in real danger of slipping back in many places to a worse situation than we were in several months ago.
COOPER: Sanjay, when you look at images, you know, inside that church tonight, again, hardly any masks, no social distancing. It's indoors. And there could have been an outdoor church service, you know, they could have probably figured out how to do that. What do you -- what do you do? I mean, as somebody who cares about public health?
DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: People ask the question, how do you do this safely? And the answer is, you really can't. I mean, in the middle of a pandemic, where we know that we account for 25 percent of the world's infections at a time when the European Union is thinking about possibly banning travel of passengers from the United States to that country. That situation you're looking at is sort of the worst case scenario.
It's indoors, as you mentioned, people can't physically distance. They're not wearing masks. We know that the rates of infections are increasing significantly in Arizona.
We know also, Anderson, from Tulsa, as you remember, I think there were eight staff members that tested positive before that event in Tulsa --
COOPER: Right, from the President's advance people.
GUPTA: Advance people and Secret Service agents. So, we don't even know like there's definitely a certain percentage of the population that you look at inside that church that have the virus, you could say that almost with confidence because of what's going on there. People who arrived early in in Arizona may have become infected, also in that particular rally.
You just couldn't possibly recommend it. I don't think any public health official would say, this is a good idea. This is now safe based on what we've done. No masks, physical distancing is a problem.
COOPER: We should also point out in Phoenix, there is an ordinance that masks should be worn inside when within six feet of somebody, clearly that's not happening here. Dr. Besser, and we're obviously still -- well, tell me where do you see us in the course of this pandemic? Obviously, a lot of hope on vaccines.
But the timing of that, you know, I mean, nobody knows, really. And if history is any guide, it's going to take longer than it seems like the administration seems to be indicating, where do you think we are?
[20:15:26]
BESSER: Well, you know, I think we're still early days. You know, when you look at any state that has done some serology testing to see what's taking place in the population, not that high a percentage of people have been infected.
And so it's early, and we're in a transition phase. So you have a number of states who have been able to really drive down cases drive down the curve. So, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and they're switching to slowly opening based on the best public health science with testing, tracking, isolation and quarantine. And it's going to be a test case to see -- can this be done in a safe way so that we don't see large increases? Have they the systems in place so that everyone who needs to isolate can?
You know, this is taking place at a time when unemployment benefits, the supplemental from the Federal government is going away when the protections against eviction and mortgage foreclosures those are going away.
And so does it mean to someone who is going back to work who is told that they've been exposed to someone who has coronavirus and has to decide well, do I quarantine for 14 days and not be able to put food on the table and risk eviction? Or do I go to work and take my chances that well, maybe I was exposed but I'm not going to get sick?
We're letting the systems fall apart that we need to have in place to make sure everyone can protect themselves, their families and their communities.
COOPER: Yes. Dr. Richard Besser, Sanjay, thank you so much. I really appreciate it.
Still to come tonight, breaking news on the investigation to what NASCAR said was a noose found in the garage stall of Bubba Wallace, the only black driver in NASCAR's top tier. F.B.I. agents and the Justice Department announced their findings. We will talk about that ahead.
Also Senator Kamala Harris joins us to talk about whether Congress can reach a deal on police reform and talk of her as a potential vice presidential nominee for Joe Biden. We'll be right back.
[20:21:25]
COOPER: Breaking news in the Federal investigation to a noose left in the garage stall of NASCAR stock car driver Bubba Wallace. Wallace is the only black driver in NASCAR's top circuit and is responsible for leading the effort to ban the Confederate flag and NASCAR events.
On Sunday a member of his team found the object, brought it to the attention of NASCAR, which alerted authorities. Wallace never saw it.
On Monday, NASCAR showed its support for Wallace with every driver marching behind him, and his car as it pulled up to the starting line. It was an emotional scene particularly for Wallace, but our Randi Kaye now has new information about the investigation. Randi, what's the latest?
RANDI KAYE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Anderson, the F.B.I. and the U.S. Attorney's Office released a joint statement today saying that after conducting numerous interviews and a thorough review, they determined that there was no Federal crime committed.
The F.B.I. assigned 15 agents to this case, which sounded like a lot to me. So I asked my F.B.I. contact, why so many? And he said that they simply wanted to get to the bottom of this quickly. They knew that it was an important issue and an important case, and in the end, they determined that the rope that was found in Bubba Wallace's garage had actually been there long before that garage was actually assigned to Bubba Wallace. Here's the joint statement.
""The investigation also revealed evidence including authentic video, confirmed by NASCAR that the noose found in garage number four was in that garage as early as October 2019. Although the noose is now known to have been in garage number four in 2019, nobody could have known Mr. Wallace would be assigned to garage number four last week,"" -- Anderson.
COOPER: And in their statement, they're still calling it a noose.
KAYE: Yes, I noticed that, too. So I said why call it a noose still if based on what your investigation has determined and my contact again said that it was his understanding that the rope was fashioned in a noose knot and it was used as a door pull, as he put it.
Also NASCAR today, Anderson, releasing a statement saying that the F.B.I. concluded based on photographic evidence that the garage door pull rope as what they called it, fashioned like a noose had been there since last fall. And this was really interesting based on a question about exactly that at a press conference yesterday with the President of NASCAR. Listen to this.
(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)
QUESTION: Can you confirm -- was the rope from the rope that you normally would pull down the garage door?
STEVE PHELPS, PRESIDENT, NASCAR: I am not sure, Bob. I have no information on that.
(END AUDIO CLIP)
KAYE: Well, he didn't know yesterday, but apparently that is exactly what it seems to be. And at a teleconference late today, Anderson, NASCAR's President said that this was the best result they could have asked for. He said that they were thrilled that Bubba Wallace was not the target of a hate crime and not the target of a noose in that garage.
COOPER: And then, apparently, there since at least last fall. Did anyone else recall seeing it?
KAYE: Yes. Wood Brothers Racing released a statement on Twitter today saying that of course they were very thankful that this wasn't what it seemed to be initially, so they were very pleased about that. But they also said some new information. They said that one of their employees without ever knowing any information about this investigation or the details of this case, or the incident told them yesterday that he recalled seeing what he refers to as a tide handle in the garage pull down rope from last fall. So, he said it was there last fall. Apparently, Wood Brothers Racing then took this information to NASCAR, and they say that they've been cooperating with this investigation ever since.
So lots of folks here, Anderson, tonight pointing to that rope being in that garage back in October last year.
COOPER: Randi Kaye. Randi, thanks very much. Joining us now is Laura Coates, former Federal prosecutor and CNN legal analyst.
Because of this moment we're in his country, it is obviously, you know, this has become a major story right away. Certainly, for NASCAR, for Bubba Wallace. This is the best possible outcome.
[20:25:09]
LAURA COATES, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Well, it is. We're in a time where sensitivities are obviously heightened and we know the climate that we're now in. And we also have the backdrop of NASCAR being requested by Bubba Wallace, the only African-American racer in all these different races to actually request for Confederate flags to be taken down, and there's been backlash about that.
So even in this climate, I look at this and first, I have more questions about the placement of this rope. How is it that people were able to come to a conclusion that led them to investigate it as a noose and possible hate crime, and then it could be dispelled so quickly? I do wonder about the facts and circumstances.
But I also know that hate crimes and the way they're investigated by the F.B.I. and the Department of Justice, is actually, they trust their own credibility here by saying, look, we're calling balls and strikes. We are looking at things and investigating. Is there an animus attached to it? We're thorough in our investigation.
And so I hope that anytime someone wants to look at this case and say, this is pure coincidence or hate crimes, in general are anomalies, and somehow are one-offs, that all of the reported increase in hate crimes up until now can't be disregarded because we know the F.B.I. will call the balls and call the strikes when they see animus or not.
COOPER: It certainly, you know, if they assign 15 agents to it, it certainly would be an indication of the seriousness with which they took this.
COATES: Well, they would. And why is that? Because we know that although Bubba Wallace -- and the wording they use here is important, Anderson, although he was not the target of a hate crime, there is nothing to suggest that they don't recognize, of course, nooses as emblematic of an ethnic form of intimidation and the hate crime legislation also looks at the circumstances as well.
The things that are meant to target someone with specificity and those that target a general population hoping to intimidate. So, the idea of taking it very seriously is of course, what you should do when you are talking about the history of nooses in America and lynching and the way it's used, typically in connection with African-Americans, and of course, not just African-Americans in this country. We know it began with Mississippi burning and discussions about what happened for Freedom writers, including Jewish-Americans down south.
And we know that it includes anyone who has a goal of justice who was targeted by mobs as well.
COOPER: And I mean, this all comes at a time obviously, in the wake of NASCAR banning the Confederate flags and Bubba Wallace was obviously very involved in. There's reports he has received threats. There were demonstrations. People showing the Confederate flag out outside NASCAR the other day.
There was this moment of unity yesterday when the drivers rallied around Bubba Wallace, and regardless of the outcome of the investigation, you know, what it is actually, you know, an example where we are seeing real changes taking place in a sport.
COATES: Absolutely. And I think -- absolutely, I think you can't disregard simply because you had this outcome where if he was not the target of a hate crime, that's a good thing for him not to be.
But there was backlash, and there was still a request that he even had to make in 2020. At what? Twenty six years old, I believe he is, having to make the request that the Confederate flag not be pervasive and prevalent at this NASCAR racing tracks around the country.
And so that in itself shows that there is some support around the notion of look, things that may have been traditionally dismissed by people as not problematic or having a fresh look at what things are right now.
And I think we can't disregard the reasons why people rallied around bubba Wallace and why frankly, Anderson? It's odd that there was something that was fashioned like a noose that hung for so long, and nobody even questioned it until now.
COOPER: Laura Coates, appreciate it. Thanks very much.
Coming up next, former presidential candidate and potential Biden running mate Kamala Harris joins us, next.
[20:33:14]
COOPER: During last night's broadcast, police and protesters have clashed outside the White House and Lafayette Park over the statue of Andrew Jackson. For nearly a month now people all across the country have been taken to the streets, protesting police violence and taking part in what has been a nationwide reexamination of race and justice and equal justice under the law.
Meantime, lawmakers grappling with police reform legislation appear to reach a stalemate in the senate with Democrats poised to block republican measure and Republican saying the move could kill any reform bill this year.
Joining us now to talk about it California Democratic senator former presidential candidate, a potential Biden running mate Kamala Harris. Thanks so much for being with us Senator.
You call the Senate --
SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA): (INAUDIBLE) yes.
COOPER: -- the Senate Republican police reform bill weak. Minority Leader Schumer has called it a non starter. Is there any way for a middle ground here because, you know, you now have a Republican saying, if this doesn't pass, there may be nothing this year.
HARRIS: Certainly there's a way for something to be done if everyone approaches it with an earnest desire to actually meet this moment and implement the reforms that we know we actually have available to us. Part of the frustration that we've had is that that the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, is putting this Republican bill up for vote tomorrow without any meaningful process. I serve on the Judiciary Committee. So does Cory Booker, and we are the two Senate authors. We've not had any hearings in the Senate Judiciary Committee.
And over a week after we proposed the justice and policing bill, it took them over a week to come up with a bill that talks about basically process and having reviews and studying issues. Ours is a bill that talks about the need for accountability and immediate accountability. So we talk about things like the need for pattern and practice investigations. When a department, an entire department is accused of having a culture that may lead to discrimination. We are talking about the need for independent investigations that prosecutors should not be investigating misconduct of police officers from a department they work with every day.
[20:35:17]
We are talking about the need for a new national standard for use of force so that instead of asking when there's excessive force, was that force reasonable, we should be asking, was it necessary? These are the concrete things that we are proposing in our bill, what they have offered, really, there's nothing salvageable about it. And I intend to vote against the motion to proceed and follow the recommendation of a vast number of civil rights groups that are urging us to vote against a motion to proceed.
COOPER: One of the things you hear a lot from Black Lives Matter protesters is defund police. It means I think different things to different people. But I'm wondering what you believe in that or believe about that about the idea of defunding police?
HARRIS: Well, here's what I believe that we need to reimagine public safety Anderson and understand that healthy communities are safe communities. So what does that mean? You know, look, when you go to upper middle class suburbs in America, you don't see that kind of police presence that you see in other neighborhoods. But what you do see are well funded schools. What you do see are families that have jobs that allow them to have an income that they don't have to worry about feeding their kids by the end of the month. What you do see are families that have access to public health, mental health without worrying about the cost of it. What you do see are communities that have small businesses that have access to capital. These are the things that make for a healthy community. If we want safe communities, we have to invest in the health and well being of those communities, and then they will be saved.
But instead, in many cities in our country, one-third of the entire city budget is spent on policing. That's actually just not a good return on investment for taxpayers. Now, of course, we don't want to get rid of police. I certainly am not saying we should get rid of police. But we do have to invest in the health and well being of our communities.
COOPER: The -- you know, obviously you're being considered as a public potential vice president pick for Vice President Biden. During the primary some people attacked you for your time as a prosecutor, a law professor and former director of the Loyola Law School Project for the innocent. There was a quote saying, Kamala is a cop. In this law school project for the innocent former director. It wrote in the Los Angeles Times, saying Kamala Harris was not a progressive prosecutor. Said time after time when progressives urged her to embrace criminal justice reforms as a district attorney and then the state's attorney general, is Harris oppose them or stayed silent.
Obviously, for Black Lives Matter protesters and many people in the streets, this is a huge issue. And I'm wondering, how do you -- what do you say to protesters who might not view you as a agent of change in a system that used to work?
HARRIS: Well, first of all, as it relates to the person that you have to in terms of those closest to simply wrong, it's just absolutely wrong. When I was Attorney General of California, I instituted one of the first requirements that law enforcement officers receive training on racial implied bias. And procedural justice, I was, I think, the first state agency that required that law enforcement agents in that state agency, wear body cameras and keep them on full time. I'm the first that created a whole division and approach that actually became a national model for what we need to do for re entry initiatives for the formerly incarcerated and getting them jobs and getting them support. So it's just simply incorrect.
And what we need right now is leaders who are prepared to deal with the fact that these are long standing grievances that are rooted in fact, which is that there have been generations of people who have been abused who have been the subject of racial profiling, who have been murdered and that we need to reform policing to avoid those by making sure there's consequences and accountability when police officers engage in misconduct. And so I'm very proud of the work that we've been doing in the Senate. I urge everyone to support the bill that Cory Booker and I have proposed on the Senate side together with our congressional black colleague, Congressional Black Caucus colleagues, and other members of the House and members of the Senate. This is a time for reform and it's a time for leaders to step up and be in a position where they can actually lead. COOPER: Senator Kamala Harris, appreciate your time. Thank you.
HARRIS: Thank you.
COOPER: Just ahead, protesters demanding the removal of Confederate statues. We'll talk about it with CNN contributor Mitch Landrieu, former mayor of New Orleans who removed for Confederate statues while the mayor.
[20:43:32]
COOPER: Earlier tonight President Trump told the crowd in Arizona that he would defend statues of Americans like Washington, Jefferson for being torn down. Left on mentioned by the President was the fact that many of the statutes protesters are wanting to remove our Confederate leaders like Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis.
Joining me now discuss it is Mitch Landrieu not only CNN contributor but while mayor of New Orleans three years ago led the effort to remove statues of Lee and Davis and two more in his city. Also joining us, is Julian Hayter author, historian, associate professor of Leadership Studies at the University of Richmond in Virginia.
Mayor Landrieu, you were front and center on this. You and Professor Hayter both in a piece I did for 60 Minutes on this subject. Talk about the -- your thought process on the removal and how you see it now.
MITCH LANDRIEU, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, a couple of things when we began we will focus on the Confederate monuments, there are over 1,700 of them, that dot the landscape in mostly the south, they will put up between 1890 and 1920. And then jump forward a couple of years, they took a break and then they put a bunch of them up in the 1950s.
These statues will put up to revere people who fought against the United States of America in the Civil War for the purpose of preserving slavery and opposition was that was inappropriate, they will put up to send a message, they will put up in places of reverence. And although they should be remembered, my position is they shouldn't be revered.
Now, as soon as we started doing that the folks at (INAUDIBLE) said, oh, contextualize them, and don't take them down, put a little plaque up. Oh, and by the way, we can't start because we don't know where we're going to stop. And it's always that argument that they use that, you know, it's going to come to take it down Lincoln and Jefferson and not stay focused on the central issue of white supremacy as it relates to the Confederate monuments. And that's of course what we're going through as we speak.
[20:45:16]
COOPER: And Professor Hayter, you know, contextualizing is one thing that has been discussed a lot. But I think what a lot of people don't realize when we're seeing the Roosevelt statue, which is outside the Museum of Natural History in New York, there's now talk for removing that, given its depiction, but just on the on the Confederate monuments. Can you talk a little bit about the history of why they were built and when because it's not as if it was done in the heat of the Civil War. This was done afterward to kind of rewrite history.
JULIAN HAYTER, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF RICHMOND: Right, these monuments it takes several decades for these monuments to emerge. And as Mr. Landrieu stated, it really is a propaganda campaign designed to rewrite the history of the Civil War and slavery.
But it's also meant to rationalize the rise of racial apartheid to characterize Jim Crow segregation, in many ways attempt to clean the South's image up in the court of public opinion by telling a story that purports slavery is a -- but was a benign institution that African-Americans were happy slaves and unprepared for freedom, and that the Confederacy was a noble cause. And in many instances, in most instances, if not all of these statues are reclamation of public space in the name of white supremacy.
COOPER: So, Professor Hayter, where do you think -- I'm wondering what you make of it, you know, it seems like the debate is now moved. There's a lot of people are saying, you know, forget about, you know, putting in a context, let's just put them somewhere else.
HAYTER: Sure. I think if these statues are warehouse, it's a wasted opportunity to actually deal with the narrative of the last cause. I think people are formulating political solutions to the problem of Confederate revisionism. The path forward however, I think will require educational tools. We -- you can't have reconciliation without recognition.
These are for many people, these statues represent institutional problems and I think tearing them down, won't make our torture racial history go away, we're going to have to deal with not merely the story of the lost cause, but what was the result of what the statue said to entrench in terms of things like Jim Crow segregation. Was that they it paved the road for how we got to now.
COOPER: Mayor Landrieu, what do you make of that?
LANDRIEU: Well, I love the professor. I disagree with him just a little bit. I don't agree that taking them down erases history I think it makes room for a total history --
HAYTER: No, I don't either. I don't either.
LANDRIEU: Yes, absolutely agree with him, that the most important thing is what we do going forward. And if we just take them down, and we don't deal with the rep that they represent, and the idea of them and that we don't have a moment of acknowledgment, we can't move towards reconciliation.
So I think he's exactly right about that part, because there has to be a reckoning in the country, but everybody will notice it. As soon as we start getting locked in on the Confederate monuments, everybody wants to take your eye off the ball and take you to Washington, Jefferson and to Grant and they don't want to stay focused on this very important and singular time and I history when people try to rewrite it and tell historical lies.
So what I said to the people of New Orleans, and you know, with that blessing in their help said, look, let's deal with this issue. Now, let's foursquare look at where it is that we came from where we want to go. And let's begin to deal with institutional bias that you now see manifesting itself in police departments.
You can see it manifesting itself in the consequences of COVID, et cetera, et cetera. The stories go on and on, but you need to get to the root of it. And the professor is exactly right, unless you get underneath it. Then if you just take the monuments down, and that's all that we do, we will have missed a great opportunity for our country.
COOPER: Professor Hayter, I've been looking at videos of I've worked in South Africa in the days leading up to the election of Mandela in the years leading up to it, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and which was an extraordinary thing. There's lots of criticism about it as well and some faults that it had.
But it's incredible to see a society which, you know, there's plenty of reasons to have animosity toward, you know, by people who were oppressed for generations, and that society has been able to move forward and kind of reinvent themselves in an extraordinary way. Do you -- I mean, I don't know that that's something like that would work here. But it's an interesting. It's just interesting to look at how South Africa did it.
HAYTER: Yes, I think the South Africans were willing to put themselves on the proverbial sofa. And, you know, and deal with the country's tortured racial history, by the way, I think that Afrikaner memory, isn't that dissimilar to the memory of the Confederacy.
It's much grounded in mythology as it is an actual history. And I think the fact that they were willing to come to the proverbial table and have a discussion about what transpired during the apartheid regime was a critical step in the reconciliation that characterize that country's ability to move forward after the demise of that terrible regime.
[20:50:05]
COOPER: Yes. Julian Hayter, it's always a pleasure to talk to you. Mayor Mitch Landrieu as well. Thank you so much.
HAYTER: Thank you.
LANDRIEU: Thank you.
COOPER: I appreciate it.
Still in Atlanta to remember, gathered to remember Rayshard Brooks shot and killed by police. We'll be right back.
COOPER: Let's check with Chris what he's working on for ""CUOMO PRIMETIME"". Chris?
CHRIS CUOMO, CNN HOST: Are trying to get everybody on the same page Coop just in terms of you got to look past D.C. for leadership in the form of the President. And we have to understand the reality of where we are with the pandemic right now. And that's the important thing. So we're going to bring in the former CDC director, we're going to talk about what the path is forward for us to get to a better place what the obstacles are.
We're going to take on the mayor of Yuma, Arizona, how do you agree that masks work, but you decide to vote against mandating them for your own city? Because it's a question of liberty. Let's test that argument tonight. We need to because that argument is spreading through the fringe right, as fast as the virus.
[20:55:11]
Also I have Ken Burns on tonight. He is AC360 worthy guests and he's going to come on tonight to talk about the statues. What are the symbols mean? What is the right place to draw the line? Is there a too far is there a too much emphasis on symbolism? Can that maybe frustrate bigger efforts? True expert on that tonight.
COOPER: Yes, his series on civil war is fantastic and all the stuff he does. Cool, Chris, I look forward to that. Seems just about four minutes from now.
Coming up next for us, how Rayshard Brooks was remembered in the church where the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. once preached.
COOPER: Eleven days after he was shot and killed by an Atlanta police officer, Rayshard Brooks was laid to rest. The funeral was held at the city's historic Ebenezer Baptist Church where the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. once preached, Dr. King's daughter, the Reverend Bernice A. King, said she knew the pain of growing up without a father.
Rayshard Brooks, his life matters, she said, and he should have been able to live to enjoy his family and watch his kids grow into adulthood. Reverend King added that it was especially troubling the Brooks was killed in a city that's home. As she described it civil and human rights. The black Mecca she called it.
He leaves a widow, three young daughters and a 13-year-old stepson. The officer who killed them is in jail charged with felony murder. The other officer involved has been charged with aggravated assault.
[21:01:00]
The news continues, I'm going to hand things over to Chris for ""CUOMO PRIME TIME"". Chris?"
124,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_251/Files (250).DOCX","Targeted News Service",2020-08-06,"2707 words",NA,"Targeted News Service",NA,"California A.G. Becerra Calls on Facebook to Step Up Action to Combat the Spread of Hate and Disinformation Online",FALSE,"California Attorney General Xavier Becerra issued the following news release on Aug. 5:
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra today joined a multistate letter calling on Facebook to take additional steps to combat the spread of hate and disinformation on the social media platform. The coalition also urges the company to do more to provide assistance to people who fall victim to online intimidation and harassment, including digital abuse and violence.
""When Facebook profits off of hate, it is letting its platform be used to dehumanize and demean,"" said Attorney General Becerra. ""The spread of hate and disinformation on social media puts our democracy and decades of advocacy work by Black Americans, Latinos, the LGBTQ community, people with disabilities, and many others at risk. If Facebook truly wants to be a place that brings people together, it must do more -- Mark Zuckerberg must do more. We urge Facebook to take affirmative steps to join us in the fight to better tackle hate in our society and disinformation in our democracy. It will take all of us working together to make a difference.""
Although Facebook has committed to the public and its users that it will ""invest billions of dollars each year to keep [Facebook's] community safe and continuously work with outside experts to review and update [Facebook's] policies,"" the recent independent civil rights audit of the company's policies and practices reveals that the steps taken thus far have fallen short. Private parties, organized groups, and public officials continue to use Facebook to spread misinformation and project messages of hate against different groups of Americans. According to recent surveys, more than forty percent of Americans have experienced some form of online harassment, including criminal forms of harassment like cyberstalking, doxing, and swatting. Of those Americans who report having been harassed online, more than three-quarters have reported being harassed on Facebook. Much of that harassment is focused on characteristics protected by the civil rights laws that state attorneys general are charged with enforcing, including race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender and gender identity, and disability. Unfortunately, recourse is unavailable for too many of these victims due to limitations on the services that Facebook offers victims.
In the letter, the Attorneys General urge Facebook to:
* Aggressively enforce the company's policies against hate speech and organized hate organizations;
* Allow public, third-party audits of hate content and enforcement;
* Commit to an ongoing, independent analysis of the platform's content population scheme and the prompt development of best practices guidance;
* Expand policies limiting inflammatory advertisements that vilify minority groups;
* Offer live real-time assistance to help users address harassment before damage becomes irreversible;
* Make information about unlawful harassment and intimidation more readily available, within the bounds of privacy laws, to victims and law enforcement; and
* Strengthen filtering, reporting, and blocking tools.
Attorney General Becerra is committed to combatting hate wherever it occurs. Last month, the Attorney General published the latest report on hate crime in California, which includes data through 2019. In June, he released a video urging Californians to stand united against hate and report suspected hate crimes to their local law enforcement agency. In April, the Attorney General issued a bulletin to help ensure law enforcement agencies across California have the necessary information and tools to continue to respond to hate crime activity during COVID-19. More information on tools and resources to combat hate crime is available at https://oag.ca.gov/hatecrimes.
In sending the letter, Attorney General Becerra joins the attorneys general of the District of Columbia, Illinois, New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin.

Mark Zuckerberg, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Sheryl Sandberg, Chief Operating Officer, Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, California 94025
Dear Mr. Zuckerberg & Ms. Sandberg:
We, the undersigned State Attorneys General, write to request that you take additional steps to prevent Facebook from being used to spread disinformation and hate and to facilitate discrimination. We also ask that you take more steps to provide redress for users who fall victim to intimidation and harassment, including violence and digital abuse.
Our nation is in the midst of a reckoning on issues of racial justice and civil rights. As State Attorneys General, we have witnessed firsthand how the country's longstanding undercurrent of discrimination has burst into the open, as reports of hate crimes and bias incidents of all kinds have dramatically increased in recent years./1 And while recent events have further highlighted the systemic injustice that persists in our society, the last few months also have seen millions of Americans join together to call for action against bias and racism.
As you know, Facebook is not immune to these problems. Although Facebook has made some progress in counteracting the use of its platform to dehumanize and demean, that is just the beginning of what is necessary./2 Private parties, organized groups, and public officials continue to use Facebook to spread misinformation and project messages of hate against different groups of Americans. In many cases, these messages lead to intimidation and harassment of particular individuals online.
According to recent surveys, more than forty percent of Americans have experienced some form of online harassment, including cyberstalking, doxing (maliciously publishing someone's personal information), and swatting (filing false police reports to prompt a law enforcement response targeting the victim)./3 Of those Americans who report having been harassed online, more than three-quarters have reported being harassed on Facebook./4 Much of that harassment is focused on characteristics protected by the civil rights laws that many of us are charged with enforcing, including race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender and gender identity, and disability./5 Recourse is unavailable for too many of these victims, due to limitations on the services that Facebook offers victims and other impediments to securing relief through civil lawsuits or criminal prosecutions.
We understand that Facebook has committed to the public and its users that it will ""invest billions of dollars each year to keep [Facebook's] community safe and continuously work with outside experts to review and update [Facebook's] policies.""/6 But, as the most recent Civil Rights Audit reveals, the steps you have taken thus far have fallen short. With the vast resources at your disposal, we believe there is much more that you can do to prevent the use of Facebook as a vehicle for misinformation and discrimination, and to prevent your users from being victimized by harassment and intimidation on your platforms.
As State Attorneys General, we are responsible for protecting the safety and wellbeing of all the communities we serve. As part of that mission, we must constantly contend with the impacts of online hate, intimidation, and harassment. Many of our offices enforce the laws that protect our residents from bias offenses, intimidation, and harassment--whether online or on our streets./7 And many of our offices include units dedicated to serving the victims of unlawful conduct, including helping them access and use tools that allow them to vindicate their rights. As part of our responsibilities to our communities, Attorneys General have helped residents navigate Facebook's processes for victims to address abuse on its platform. While Facebook has--on occasion--taken action to address violations of its terms of service in cases where we have helped elevate our constituents' concerns,/8 we know that everyday users of Facebook can find the process slow, frustrating, and ineffective. Thus, we write to highlight positive steps that Facebook can take to strengthen its policies and practices. We hope to work with you to ensure that fewer individuals suffer online harassment and discrimination, and that it is quickly and effectively addressed when they do.
Based on our collective experience, we believe that Facebook should take additional actions including the following steps--many of which are highlighted in Facebook's recent Civil Rights Audit--to strengthen its commitment to civil rights and fighting disinformation and discrimination:
* Aggressively enforce Facebook policies against hate speech and organized hate organizations: Although Facebook has developed policies against hate speech and organizations that peddle it, we remain concerned that Facebook's policies on Dangerous Individuals and Organizations, including but not limited to its policies on white nationalist and white supremacist content, are not enforced quickly and comprehensively enough./9 Content that violates Facebook's own policies too often escapes removal just because it comes as coded language, rather than specific magic words. And even where Facebook takes steps to address a particular violation, it often fails to proactively address the follow-on actions by replacement or splinter groups that quickly emerge.
* Allow public, third-party audits of hate content and enforcement: To gauge the ongoing progress of Facebook's enforcement efforts, independent experts should be permitted access to the data necessary to conduct regular, transparent third-party audits of hate and hate-related misinformation on the platform, including any information made available to the Global Oversight Board. As part of this effort, Facebook should capture data on the prevalence of different forms of hate content on the platform, whether or not covered by Facebook's own community standards, thus allowing the public to determine whether enforcement of anti-hate policies differs based on the type of hate content at issue.
* Commit to an ongoing, independent analysis of Facebook's content population scheme and the prompt development of best practices guidance: By funneling users toward particular types of content, Facebook's content population scheme, including its algorithms, can push users into extremist online communities that feature divisive and inflammatory messages, often directed at particular groups. Although Facebook has conducted research and considered programs to reduce this risk, there is still no mandatory guidance for coders and other teams involved in content population. Facebook should commit to an ongoing, independent analysis of its content population scheme, including its algorithms, and also continuously implement mandatory protocols as best practices are identified to curb bias and prevent recommendations of hate content and groups.
* Expand policies limiting inflammatory advertisements that vilify minority groups: Although Facebook currently prohibits ads that claim that certain people, because of their membership in a protected group, pose a threat to the physical safety of communities or the nation, its policies still allow attacks that characterize such groups as threats to national culture or values.10 The current prohibition should be expanded to include such ads.
We also recommend the following measures to improve the supportive services that Facebook offers to users who have been or may become victims of harassment and intimidation on its platforms:
* Offer live real-time assistance: Facebook users can report intimidation and harassment but cannot immediately engage a Facebook employee who can promptly address issues that are occurring in real time. Victims of intimidation and harassment would benefit from more immediate access to Facebook employees who can offer prompt assistance. For example, if a user is being doxed, live assistance could help stop the spread of the user's personal information before the damage cannot be undone.
* Make information about harassment and intimidation more readily available: Facebook should facilitate evidence preservation and cooperate with victims and law enforcement agencies seeking evidence to prove a case of harassment or intimidation, such as cyberstalking or non-consensual distribution of intimate imagery, when the offenders use Facebook to perpetrate their crimes.
* Strengthen filtering, reporting, and blocking tools: Facebook allows users to block individual people, but users should have stronger tools and more choices for filtering out and reporting hateful, intimidating, and harassing content they do not want to see in their feeds. For example, if members of a Facebook group are engaged in an organized campaign of harassment against a single user, the victim should be able to block all members of the group and report batches of posts or users without having to block or report each individually.
We urge Facebook to take these steps to better tackle hate in our society, and address the interests of users who are victimized by others in the online community that Facebook has built.

Chinese-American neighbourhood patrols in New York and California are bracing for a spike in anti-Asian harassment and possible violence in the days leading up to the November 3 US presidential elections and what could be a turbulent aftermath, community activists say. 
While Chinese-Americans have faced racism throughout America's history, researchers and activists assert that Sinophobia has surged as a result of US President Donald Trump's inflammatory language - particularly in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, which Trump and other officials in his administration have repeatedly tied to China. 
Since March, when the first US outbreaks of the pandemic began to spread, the Stop AAPI [short for Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders] Hate reporting centre has recorded more than 2,700 incidents of discrimination, verbal abuse and physical attacks in 47 states and Washington. 
Get the latest insights and analysis from our Global Impact newsletter on the big stories originating in China. 
In an interview, Russell Jeung, the Stop AAPI Hate chair and an Asian-American Studies professor at San Francisco State University, said that many of the rising incidents could be directly correlated to incendiary rhetoric from the Trump administration. 
""The current administration exacerbated the situation greatly by insisting on using the term 'Chinese virus' rather than a natural virus,"" he said. ""That racialised the disease ... it spreads quickly, and hate speech then leads to hate violence."" 
Nearly one-third of reported incidents through August included rhetoric specifically mentioning China. In one incident outside a hospital in Boston, for example, a man shouted accusations that the Chinese were ""killing everyone"". 
In another incident, in Pennsylvania's Dickson Country, an Asian resident was told that the ""pandemic wouldn't have happened if you'd stayed in your country where you belong"" and accused of bringing Covid-19 ""on purpose"". 
""Our self-reported incidents are just the tip of the iceberg,"" Jeung added, noting that some conservative estimates suggest that as many as 1,000 racist incidents against Asians take place each day in California alone. ""It's actually a really high number."" 
Among those who have seen the impact of Trump's rhetoric on America's streets is Karlin Chan, a community activist and lifelong resident of New York City's sprawling Chinatown. 
""At the beginning [of the pandemic], people would make snide little remarks under their breath, and you'd see it in their body language,"" he said. ""But when the lockdown went into effect and the streets were devoid of people, that's when the harassment began. Not so much physical, but a lot of verbal harassment."" 
Among the incidents, Chan said, were repeated barrages of racist slurs and insults on subway passengers riding between Manhattan's Chinatown and another in nearby Queens. In another - which he called a ""crime of opportunity"" amid the lockdown - a local laundromat was robbed. 
Not all the reported incidents, Chan said, were verified. Some cases, such as a woman who was reportedly robbed twice in one day, are ""hard to believe"". Other incidents took place outside the immediate area, such as an acid attack on an Asian woman in Brooklyn's Sunset Park. 
In another attack in September, a promising Japanese jazz musician was set upon by eight assailants at a subway station on West 135th Street in upper Manhattan. 
While the police did not classify the incident as a hate crime, the victim told authorities and journalists he remembers being called ""Chinese"" in the assault, which left him with multiple broken bones. 
The harassment, Chan recalled, quickly created an atmosphere of fear among Chinatown residents, particularly women and the elderly. 
""Even incidents that we couldn't verify, or that weren't around here, spread quickly on social media,"" Chan added. ""Lots of non-English-speaking people would spread them on WeChat, for example. They wouldn't know exactly where they happened or what happened, but it spread anyway."" 
""People were even afraid to leave their houses and get out there to do shopping and buy food,"" he said. ""I had to do something about it. I've always fought for this neighbourhood ... so I started patrolling, trying to keep an eye out and seeing if this harassment is actually going on. And it is."" 
As the weeks and months of the pandemic wore on, what began as one or two-man patrols of community activists has evolved into a Chinatown 'block watch' with more than 40 volunteer members, complete with orange uniforms. 
""What it does is visually assure our residents and business owners, who were sometimes getting robbed, since nobody was there,"" Chan explained. ""It's a deterrent."" 
In Chan's view, it's clear what - and who - drives the rising incidence of racism against the community. 
""There's no civility anymore. It got very bad in the last two and a half years,"" he said. ""The dialogue coming out of Washington seems to have legitimised racism in this country and promoted it around the world."" 
Across the county, residents of San Francisco's Chinatown - the oldest in North America - have also banded together to protect their community at a difficult time. 
At the heart of this effort is Leanna Louie, a China-born immigrant and 11-year veteran of the US Army, where she served as both an enlisted soldier and later as an officer, including a tenure as an executive officer responsible for the day-to-day organisation and training of a company of 120 soldiers. 
Together with other residents - including a number of other Asian-American veterans of the US Army, Marine Corps and Navy - Louie helped set up the United Peace Collaborative, a registered non-profit organisation. 
Louie said she felt compelled to act after learning of ""bad things"" happening in the area, particularly the vicious attack on the president of a local family association. 
""He was beaten and mugged by three criminals, who took away his Rolex watch. They also beat his friend who tried to help him,"" she recalled. ""All the while, Chinatown was just watching, scared to get involved."" 
This attack, she added, was just part of a larger of wave of incidents of pandemic-inspired racism against Asian-Americans - including those outside the Chinese-American community. 
""Things have gotten worse. For one, the president calling it a 'Chinese' virus is very problematic, even for people that only look Chinese,"" she said. ""Japanese people are also getting beat up, and Filipinos are also having problems. If you look Asian, you can be in trouble. People think you're not human ... it's horrible, disheartening and very concerning."" 
In San Francisco, Louie said, the line between outright incidents of racism and of opportunistic crime are often blurred. She said that the UPC's greatest success came on the night of May 30, amid the unrest that rocked the country following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota. 
Tipped off that looters were heading to Chinatown from downtown, Louie and a handful of UPC volunteers came face to face with a group of over 50 looters, who had already severely beaten one resident. The UPC patrol managed to quickly alert local police, and Louie says that the cellphone footage she provided led to the arrest of four suspects. 
""We were tipped that something was going on and we did what we could to stop them,"" she said. ""If we weren't there, they could have destroyed the entire Chinatown, all 22 blocks."" 
On both coasts, activists say that part of the reason they have had to act is that many local residents - particularly more recent Chinese immigrants - are reluctant to report crimes or harassment to police forces that they don't trust. 
""Nobody calls 911 in Chinatown. They are afraid of miscommunication, and there are a lot of trust issues,"" Louie said. 
Louie noted that the San Francisco Police Department's Central Station, which is responsible for Chinatown, also covers North Beach, Nob Hill, Russian Hill and other nearby neighbourhoods. 
""Of the 120 officers or so officers, only eight of them are bilingual in Chinese languages,"" she said. ""The population of Chinatown is 34,000 people, many of whom are only Chinese-speaking."" 
Similarly, in New York, Karlin Chan said that many residents of Manhattan's Chinatown are hesitant to deal with police at all, let alone report crimes. 
""People don't want to deal with government and want to stay under the radar,"" he said. ""People are afraid of retaliation, but also, if you don't speak English, you have no idea what the police are saying, and they have no idea what you're trying to tell them."" 
""People think it's more frustrating even than getting mugged,"" he added. ""So they're very reluctant."" 
Looking ahead, activists and self-organised patrols may prove even more necessary in Chinese-American communities than they have been even during the pandemic. Both the UPC in San Francisco and Karlin Chan's Blockwatch in New York say they have no plans to end their activities. 
Stop AAPI Hate believes that the next few days will be particularly dangerous for the Asian-American community as candidates - including Trump - use anti-Chinese rhetoric in a bid for votes. 
""When people China-bash, they also bash Chinese in the US. This won't go away soon,"" Jeung said. ""The issue is really urgent now ... People are going to blame China even more. We have to be even more vigilant."" 
No matter who wins, xenophobia and harassment against Chinese-Americans is unlikely to dissipate in the months following the election. 
""We're really fearful of increased attacks on Asians in America, through January, at least,"" Jeung said. ""The fact that we have a looming Cold War with China will again see us targeted as the enemy. I don't think this will go away soon."" 
In this setting, he added, it is likely that organizations and local groups will need to work closely together to protect Asian-American communities. 
""I see mobilisation on all levels,"" he said. ""We hold governments and corporations accountable. But in lieu of their failure to respond, Asian-American communities have to mobilise to protect ourselves, public safety, and public health.""

""The FBI report concludes, and photographic evidence confirms, that the garage door pull rope fashioned like a noose had been positioned there since as early as last fall,"" Nascar said in a statement. ""This was obviously well before the 43 team's arrival and garage assignment.
""We appreciate the FBI's quick and thorough investigation and are thankful to learn that this was not an intentional, racist act against Bubba. We remain steadfast in our commitment to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all who love racing.""
The FBI said there will be no charges over the incident.
A crew member found the noose at the Talladega Superspeedway on Sunday and it was reported to Nascar. An investigation involving the justice department and FBI was launched on Monday, two weeks after Wallace had started a successful campaign to remove the Confederate flag from Nascar events. The removal was not welcomed by some fans who paraded the flag outside the Talladega track at the weekend.
In an appearance on CNN on Tuesday, Wallace said he had received backlash on social media after the FBI's findings were released, despite the fact that he did not find or report the noose.
""I'm pissed. I'm mad because people are trying to test my character and the person that I am and my integrity,"" he said.
He added, that having seen the rope, it looked like a noose. ""It was a noose. Whether tied in 2019, or whatever, it was a noose,"" he said. ""So, it wasn't directed at me, but somebody tied a noose.""
Before Monday's race at Talladega, Wallace was given a stirring show of support by his fellow drivers and the pit crews, who pushed his car to the front of the grid. Wallace broke down in tears after the gesture.
Nascar has only had four black drivers in its 72-year history, and has long been known for elements of racism in its fanbase. Another noose was found at a racetrack in California on Saturday, and an investigation is yet to be concluded."
128,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_251/Files (250).DOCX","CNN.com",2020-07-07,"827 words","OPINIONS","Opinion by Joey Jackson and Diana Florence",NA,"What prosecutors can learn from the Amy Cooper case",FALSE,"On May 25, a video went viral of a White woman calling the police on a Black man in Central Park after he asked her to follow the rules and leash her dog. On her call to 911, she allegedly lied, claiming he was threatening her, and specifically emphasized his race as part of her report.
In the days and weeks that followed, the name Amy Cooper became synonymous with the kind of racist, false 911 call often made by White women that can have catastrophic consequences for the Black person on the other end. Within 24 hours, Cooper faced swift retribution online and lost her job. (Amy Cooper later apologized for her action and the birder, Christian Cooper, told CNN ""if it's genuine and if she plans on keeping her dog on a leash in the Ramble going forward, then we have no issues with each other."")
But until Monday, when Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance announced that Amy Cooper was being charged with falsely reporting an incident in the third degree, the one repercussion she avoided was criminal prosecution.
It's been more than six weeks since Amy Cooper cried wolf. Why is she only now being charged for what appeared to be a very public crime?
Making a false report to 911 is a crime in New York and most states. It's also against New York's civil rights law and comes with penalties. Over the past few years, we have become increasingly familiar with this specific kind of false reporting. Whether it's a Black person birding in Central Park, enjoying a barbecue, getting coffee at a Starbucks, working as a home inspector, shopping at Nordstrom Rack, or sleeping in the common room of their own dorm. The list is endless. What we see is a disturbing trend, and not one that typically ends with the caller facing criminal prosecution for putting a Black person in harm's way.
Writing as a Black man, it is obvious that these calls are racially motivated. And writing as a White woman, it must be said that it is our responsibility to stop using the state as our personal security force. But where is the incentive for that when there's seldom any consequence? The White woman who accused 14-year-old Emmett Till of whistling at her in 1955 -- resulting in a famously brutal lynching -- recanted her testimony two years ago and no one was ever brought to justice.
It's not just White women, though. In Georgia, two White men (who happened to be connected with law enforcement) called 911 and then hunted down Ahmaud Arbery. Authorities say they shot and killed a man in broad daylight for essentially jogging while Black, yet it took prosecutors 74 days and immense public pressure to finally charge them.
If we truly want to stop White people from calling the police on Black people for just going about their lives, district attorneys need to start by actually prosecuting this kind of crime when it occurs, not six weeks later. The existing penal code is already clear, but New York and California lawmakers have also introduced legislation that would allow prosecutors to classify race-based, false reporting calls as a hate crime.
As a former prosecutor and a practicing defense attorney, we both understand the likely reality of justice delayed in Amy Cooper's case. Our justice system has a long history of ignoring or downplaying the crimes of White people, from bailing out the heads of the financial industry who brought about the 2008 housing crash to the so-called ""Karens"" who police public space. At the same time, as we have both seen firsthand, our system often aggressively punishes and trumps up charges against Black and brown people. While we need sweeping changes to address these inequalities, district attorneys -- because of their power and prosecutorial discretion -- have the power, right now, to start leveling the scales.
At its core, the job of district attorneys is to prosecute cases on behalf of their county. They decide which charges to bring and what evidence to provide in those cases. This means the DAs have incredible power to shape what reform looks like. We need progressive district attorneys across the country who are willing to institute policies to protect Black and brown people from mass incarceration. District attorneys who will decline to prosecute low-level offenses against people of color and end cash bail that poorer people cannot pay; who will replace laws and practices rooted in racism with effective reforms that can reverse some of the most damaging effects of the past few decades of tough-on-crime policies. But at the same time, it is the job of those same district attorneys to take seriously the crimes that stem directly from the racism in our system.
Crimes that may seem minor, like calling the police on a man in the park, can have disastrous consequences. As we well know, calling 911 can result in the loss of innocent Black lives like Rayshard Brooks in Atlanta, and could have ended Central Park birder Christian Cooper's, too.
It's time to stop giving the Karens of the world a pass."

It's past time for this hate that is being exposed daily to stop,"" Jennifer Baxtron, the leader of Black Lives Matter Potsdam, said in a statement Tuesday. ""We will not be silent, we will speak up. We will fight against this ignorance and we need the White people of St. Lawrence County to join us, to step up for their Black neighbors. Your silence is not acceptable.""
Police did not release the location of the residence where the noose was left, but said it was about a block away from St. Mary's Church, which is located on Cornell Avenue in the village.
Anyone who has information regarding the origin of the noose, or who was involved in placing it at that location, is ""strongly urged"" to contact the Massena Police Department at 315-769-3577.

Meanwhile in Bloomington, Indiana, a driver described by witnesses as white and in her 40s reportedly revved her engine and drove into a large crowd, running several red lights with a woman forced up onto her car's bonnet. The victim was taken to hospital; it is as yet unclear whether the police have identified the driver and passenger.
The protest where the attack happened was in part a response to a racist attack on 4 July in which Black human rights advocate Vauhxx Booker was subjected to what he himself called ""an attempted lynching"". He was physically and verbally assaulted by several white assailants, who at one point shouted ""white power"" and ""get a noose"".

FULL TEXT
Introduction
Studies of bias-motivated offending in criminology, termed as ‘hate studies’, have given rise to a plethora of research on the parameters of such crimes (see Hall, 2013; Perry, 2001) and their symbolic capacity within criminal justice processes (Mason, 2013). Further, hate studies have provided the opportunity for criminology to consider the boundaries of its project (Jenness and Grattet, 2001), identifying the necessity for criminology to re-engage with issues of racism (Dixon and Ray, 2007), and the social harms engendered by bias-motivated behaviours that are not defined as crimes (Tombs, 2018). With the intention of furthering discussion in this area, this article identifies the harms of hate experienced by Gypsies and Travellers that are multiple and varied, normalized and complex. By utilizing a critical hate studies approach (James and McBride, 2018) and drawing on empirical data gathered in a rural area of England, the article considers explanations for the hate experienced by Gypsies and Travellers. The harms of hate discussed here constitute subjective harms that manifest as crimes, systemic harms that are inherent within processes and structures of governance, and symbolic harms expressed via speech and language (Žižek, 2008). The article is therefore able to present a critical analysis of hate harms that recognizes the human need to flourish, rather than simply to survive, in late modernity.
The article will initially set out the existing ‘problem’ presented by Gypsies and Travellers, wherein their experiences of criminalization and victimization overlap and must be considered within the context of the tensions between (and misunderstandings of) sedentarism and nomadism. The article specifically deals with issues of race, crime and victimization by virtue of discussing the diverse communities represented by the limiting moniker of ‘Gypsies and Travellers’. Further, the article acknowledges and challenges hierarchies of difference that exist within legislation, policies and practice, and considers how a more nuanced approach, informed by the perspectives of Gypsies and Travellers themselves serves better to appreciate their lived experience (Phillips and Bowling, 2008). The article then goes on to provide a framework for analysis that is informed by ultra-realist criminology (Hall and Winlow, 2015).1 In doing so, the article responds to a call for critical thinking within hate studies (Perry, 2006).
The harms of hate are elaborated in this article in relation to the realms of recognition human subjects require to flourish, that are love, esteem and respect (Yar, 2012). By approaching the harms of hate in this way, it is possible to identify and draw out the omnipresence of neoliberal capitalism on the lived experiences of Gypsies and Travellers as its vagaries serve to block access to true recognition of human needs (Honneth, 1996). The article, therefore, identifies how criminological theory can move beyond existing debates in studies of race and ethnicity and engage more effectively with the wider social sciences, specifically psychology and sociology. In doing so, the article intends to identify a nuanced approach that acknowledges the unique nature of Gypsies’ and Travellers’ experiences as a specific minority perspective. However, the article also makes a universal point about the nature of human subjectivities based on a consideration of the fundamental formation of the human self.
Methodology
The theoretical approach here is based on a comprehensive reading of literature in the areas of identity, hate studies, criminology and Romani studies. In order to illuminate the theoretical framework the article draws on evidence gathered in 2015 on the harms of hate experienced by Gypsies and Travellers that was part of a wider research study on the accommodation needs of Gypsies and Travellers in the south-west of England (Southern et al., 2015). In agreement with the study funders,2 that research incorporated a small survey of Gypsies’ and Travellers’ experiences of hate behaviours, including both hate incidents and hate crimes. The survey gathered data on what had happened and whether Gypsies and Travellers had reported the hate they had experienced to any formal or community reporting agencies, and if not, why not. The survey data incorporated closed and open questions on numbers of hate behaviours, as well as their locations, reporting, responses of agencies reported to and perceptions of hate victimization. A Gypsy and Traveller support organization carried out the survey alongside the wider accommodation needs assessment. Respondents completed the survey themselves or received support to complete the survey so that all those sampled could contribute to the research, no matter their levels of literacy (McCaffery, 2009).
The Gypsy and Traveller accommodation assessment was completed by 187 people who lived in a range of accommodation including those who normally resided on approved sites as well as those who lived in illegal spaces. Because there is no existing sampling frame for this population, a snowball sample was utilized which targeted groups in known sites in the first instance and used their contacts to access other, harder to reach, Gypsies and Travellers. Although snowball sampling can be considered unrepresentative, it is a reasonably valid strategy that was sensitive to the shifting population and enabled access to be gained to people living on authorized sites, unauthorized spaces, transit spaces and in bricks and mortar accommodation that tend to be the hardest groups to access (Sturgis, 2008). Of the 187 people that completed the accommodation needs assessment, 79 chose to answer the hate crime questions. Given the high number of questions in the accommodation needs assessment (54 questions) and thus the time taken to complete it, it was surprising and actually gratifying that 79 people were additionally prepared to answer the hate crime questions. It should also be noted that on two incomplete surveys notes were found stating, ‘fearful of repercussion’. Those people who chose to answer the questions self-identified as Romany Gypsies (41%), New Travellers (53%) and others, including Show people (6%), reflecting the proportions of the wider sample of Gypsies and Travellers in the accommodation needs assessment.
In addition to the survey, the research team followed up the hate crime survey with a small number of requests for interviews with respondents. Subsequently, three in-depth interviews with Romany Gypsy and New Travellers were completed. These telephone interviews each lasted for at least an hour and addressed a range of issues highlighted by the survey component of the research.
The ‘problem’ of Gypsies and Travellers
Gypsies, Travellers and Roma constitute the largest minority in Europe (Council of Europe, 2011) and Gypsies and Travellers in the UK have been approximated to comprise 1.5% of the UK population (Greenfields and Smith, 2009). Defining the population of Gypsies and Travellers in the UK has been notoriously problematic. Although in the 2011 census space was provided for those of Romany Gypsy and Irish Traveller status to self-identify, research suggests that those 63,000 people who completed the survey does not equate to their population in full (Cromarty, 2018). Indeed, one of the controversial, and arguably divisive, issues within Gypsy and Traveller studies is the determination of who qualifies as having Gypsy or Traveller identity and thus status. Policy and planning in this regard have served to confuse discussion and identification, and consequently the statistics. Race relations legislation acknowledges Romany Gypsies, Irish Travellers and Scottish Travellers as deserving protection as specific ethnic groups.3 New Travellers and other Travellers, such as Show people, are not protected by this legislation, despite their inter-generational cultural nomadism4 and their ethnicity in the case of Show people (LeedsGATE, 2019). Further, planning policy determines ‘travellers’ [sic] as only those people that are mobile and thus has negated the status of many Gypsies and Travellers, including those recognized as ethnic groups, for planning purposes if they stop travelling on a permanent basis. As noted by James and Southern (2019), this policy has potentially damaging consequences for the most vulnerable Gypsies and Travellers in England and Wales. The old and very young, disabled or infirm, are the least likely Gypsies and Travellers to be mobile and are thus the most likely to have their homes placed at risk within the planning policy framework, unless they are assimilated into bricks and mortar accommodation that is often culturally anathema.5 Overall then, the identity and status of Gypsies and Travellers in the UK is contradictory in policy and legislation. While Gypsies and Travellers themselves, and the civil society organizations that support them, are confident and proud in their cultures, common histories and differences, the state has failed to provide an overarching protective environment for them. Nor has it appropriately accommodated those communities, who have suffered what has been described as an ‘accommodation crisis’ (Cemlyn et al., 2009) throughout the latter part of the 20th century and into the 21st century.
Multiple research studies and articles have evidenced the marginalized position of Gypsies and Travellers in late modernity (Brearley, 2001; Frazer and Marlier, 2011; Greenfields and Brindley, 2016), including the negation of their ‘cultural nomadism’ (James and Southern, 2019: 324; Kabachnik, 2009). Research has also identified the ways in which Gypsies and Travellers have been criminalized as a consequence of planning policy and practice. Indeed, Ellis and McWhirter (2008: 82) refer to the planning process as the ‘critical interface’ between Gypsies and Travellers and the state. The failure to accommodate Gypsies and Travellers has often resulted in them stopping and staying in places that are deemed illegitimate and public order legislation used to move them on via formal eviction or the threat of such eviction. In association with this criminalizing process, the localism agenda of recent coalition and conservative governments has facilitated settled communities’ negative (and often racist) perceptions of Gypsies and Travellers to inform planning processes and thus prevent site provision. The implications of this are multiple as all Gypsies and Travellers, whether living in bricks and mortar accommodation, legal or illegal sites are vilified and the application of racist tropes are applied to them, no matter their ethnicity. Sibley (1988) uses the work of Douglas (1966) to explain the application of societal notions of ‘purity and danger’ to Gypsies and Travellers, and in doing so he notes how they are stigmatized as ‘a threat to the integrity of the collective’ (Sibley, 1988: 410). Thus, the public consciousness reduces Gypsies and Travellers to a negative, racialized ‘other’.
Within the European policy environment lobbying by civil society organizations led to comprehensive EU-wide level policies for Roma6 inclusion that was intended to guide states towards effective inclusionary policy and practice. However, the capacity of these policies to be impactful on the lived experience of Gypsies and Travellers has been questioned (James and Smith, 2017) and UK implementation of the EU Framework for Roma Inclusion has been ‘exceptionally slow’ (National Federation of Gypsy Liaison Groups et al., 2014: 13). In addition, the United Nations International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination periodic report (2016: 6) found that Gypsies, Travellers and Roma in the UK ‘continue to face exclusion and discrimination’. Further, recent research has identified that Gypsy, Traveller and Roma children in England and Wales experience deprivation in relation to their standard of living, education and/or health (Battaglini et al., 2018; EHRC, 2019).
Increasingly, a ‘hate crime’ agenda has provided policy and legislative vehicles for challenging the ill-treatment of Gypsies and Travellers in the UK. Redress for people victimized on the basis of their identity, and associated reporting mechanisms, have been developed that illuminate the extent of such victimization. Based on and informed by the recommendations made by Macpherson (1999) following an enquiry into the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence, the hate crime agenda has developed similarly to other western jurisdictions, most notably the USA (Hall, 2015). Identifying offences motivated by hostility towards a person’s identity, and associated policy frameworks, has functioned symbolically within states to ‘punish, deter and denounce’ hate behaviours (Mason, 2015). Notwithstanding critiques of the hate crime concept (see Jacobs and Potter (1998) for example), the hate crime agenda has rarely been comprehensive in its capacity to challenge all hate as outlined by Wickes et al. (2016), and specifically hate against Gypsies and Travellers for two specific reasons. First, despite the fact that policy encourages the reporting of hate incidents, as well as crimes, it is highly unlikely that they will be reported to agencies due to their regularity and the resilience this engenders (Williams and Tregidga, 2014) and their minor nature and victims’ perceptions of likelihood for redress (Christmann and Wong, 2010). As Iganski (2008) notes and the research below identifies and discusses, many incidents of hate are petty and banal, akin to the everyday racism previously discussed by Essed (1991). Further, Gypsies and Travellers tend to conflate their experiences of hate incidents with discrimination and thus are unlikely to report to agencies that they perceive as prejudiced towards them, including those set up as third parties (James, 2014). This is despite the policy intention for third party reporting mechanisms to breach the gap between socially excluded communities and support agencies. Gypsy and Traveller support agencies’ anecdotal evidence, as well as the evidence presented in the research below, suggest that Gypsies and Travellers are loath to report hate behaviours (House of Commons, 2019). This is troubling, given the cumulative impact of such events and the likelihood of their seriousness increasing (Bowling, 1999).
Second, the complexity of policy and legislation defining Gypsy and Traveller identities means that they are not necessarily, and/or they do not perceive themselves to be, protected by hate crime policy and legislation. Some Gypsies and Travellers are able to report race hate behaviours, as per their protected ethnic identity (such as Romany Gypsies and Irish Travellers). However, those Gypsies and Travellers not recognized within legislation as a specific ethnic group (such as Show people and New Travellers) are thus not incorporated within the race hate protections, despite their cultural, and often ethnic, similarities. This can result in some Gypsies’ and Travellers’ experiences going unrecorded, subsequently not investigated nor supported by the police and other agencies that the flagging of an incident as hate behaviour would otherwise trigger. While some policing agencies do record hate behaviours beyond the five protected categories in legislation that might provide some additional support for all Gypsies and Travellers in those areas, this is not common (Traveller Movement, 2018).
Critical hate studies
‘Critical hate studies’ (James and McBride, 2018) developed as a response to a call by Perry (2006) for greater critical theorizing in hate studies. Further, the perspective grew out of a specific concern that existing critical theorizing (Perry, 2001) was unable to explain the breadth of hate behaviours in society that were both extreme and ‘everyday’ (Essed, 1991; Iganski, 2008) and have been exacerbated by the failure of agencies to implement joined-up, effective responses to bias-motivated behaviours (Chakraborti, 2018; HMICFRS, 2018). Perry’s (2001) work within hate studies has been seminal and has arguably provided the critical backbone to research in this area (Hall, 2015). Perry (2001) argues that hate behaviours serve to reinforce structural boundaries in society that sustain privilege according to race, gender and sexuality. In her analysis, Perry uses Messerschmidt’s (1997) structured-action approach to explain how human subjectivity is informed by hegemonic norms. Critical hate studies acknowledges the need to provide a critical analysis of hate in late modernity underpinned by a nuanced account of human subjectivity, drawing on ultra-realist theorizing (see Hall and Winlow, 2015) to meet that aim.
The critical hate studies perspective acknowledges that the overriding condition of late modern society is the neoliberal capitalist political economy, as identified by critical theorists (Davies, 2017; Harvey, 2005). Neoliberal capitalism has seen a shift in the logic of social organization, from an environment ordered according to political judgement to one ordered by economic evaluation. Structures of power based on race, gender, class and sexuality have therefore increasingly been co-opted to serve the needs of capital in a society that equates value with fiscal success, rather than political prowess. Neoliberal capitalism encourages and engenders flexibility and adaptability, individualism and competitiveness, while ensuring adherence to market principles in delivery of services, and reduction of costs in provision of welfare. Thus, the neoliberal capitalist political economy embraces the power of the individual within the confines of meeting market needs. This shift in the logic ordering the social world (while more complex and nuanced than I am able to give credit to here), has created an environment within which individual identity characteristics are not core determinants of success or failure in life. The power of elites, and thus the power of white propertied men, has been retained within neoliberalism as wealth, production and ownership has been held in the hands of the few as a consequence of the industrial revolution and the colonial project, and their inherent racism and sexism (Cain and Hopkins, 2001). However, within the competitive individualism of neoliberalism, status provided by race, gender or even class or sexuality does not always assure privilege as it can be subverted by the ‘special liberty’ provided by neoliberal ideology (Hall and Winlow, 2015: 120). Thus, it behoves critical hate studies scholars to consider how and why hate manifests within these conditions. In order to do this, it is necessary to consider the impact of neoliberalism on human subjectivity and consequently how we think about other people within society as hateful subjects.
According to a transcendental materialist model of subjectivity (Johnston, 2008; Žižek, 2006), the self is realized via interaction within the social world and is indeed reliant on that environment for its formation, as per Perry’s (2001) analysis. However, the distinction here is the use of Lacan’s (1977) work in identifying the infinitely malleable nature of the human psyche that requires an ordering mechanism to make sense of the world. Lacan’s approach to the development of subjectivity identifies the human psyche as in search of a symbolic order that can direct and provide capacity for the complex range of emotions and drives that manifest in the neurological system; Lacan therefore suggests that the natural drives and desires of the human subject require channelling. Within a neoliberal environment, that channelling symbolic order is weak as neoliberal capitalism relies on a flexible human condition wherein natural drives and desires are channelled into the market, rather than any sense of collectivity as might manifest in culture and thus create boundaries to capital accumulation (Winlow and Hall, 2016). The human subject then is left wanting, lost within a quagmire of neurological triggers and ontological insecurity (Hall, 2012) that are pacified only by collectivity that is oriented around individualized, competitive identities, rather than notions of community and/or culture (Hall and Winlow, 2015).
Having established that neoliberalism creates the conditions within which we live, and our subjective identity is formed via interaction within the conditions of neoliberalism, we can understand and explain why hate manifests in multiple aspects of social life. Extreme acts of bias-motivated offending are explained as individuals in search of an ordering mechanism in their lives embrace religious dogma, ideological systems based on hierarchical notions of race, gender, sexuality and/or other defined ideologies. Everyday acts of bias-motivated violence are explained as without any effective symbolic order individuals experience a sense of ‘objectless anxiety’ wherein competition and individualism means that ‘everyone is automatically a potential real threat to anyone else’s livelihood, status and identity’ (Hall and Winlow, 2015: 114; see also Hall et al., 2008).
Critical hate studies then provides a theoretical backdrop to understand why hate harms happen as identified here. Furthermore, it goes on to suggest that in order to appreciate the lived experience of hate victimization within neoliberalism it is necessary to use a framework that incorporates all the harms of hate that are subjective, systemic and symbolic (Žižek, 2008). In order to do this critical hate studies utilizes the theory of recognition as developed by Yar (2012) using Honneth (1996) that sets out the necessity for humans to be respected, esteemed and loved in their lives in order to flourish. Although critiques of theories of recognition pose relevant and useful questions (Fraser, 2001; Toniolatti, 2015), the purpose of the theory here is to provide one way of unpacking the harms of hate within neoliberalism that acknowledge the development of human subjectivity. Recognition of the human need to flourish facilitates appreciation of the harms caused by its negation. Critical race theory identifies the symbolic violence of negating human experiences, be that within for example, policy discourse, legislation or historical narrative (Bell, 1980). The critical hate studies perspective argues that negation of recognition occurs throughout society, but is particularly felt within the precariat wherein marginalized people exist at the bottom of social hierarchies (Standing, 2014). As noted above, some Gypsies and Travellers are not ethnic groups; Gypsies’ and Travellers’ lived experience of hate exemplifies the limitations of critical race theory in this regard. To suggest that ethnicity does not determine all Gypsy and Traveller identities does not, in turn, intend to negate the rich, varied and strong ethnic experiences of the majority of Gypsies and Travellers. Indeed, to do so would be to fail to recognize the history of suffering that Gypsies and Travellers have experienced as a result of racism, not least the Pořajmos7 (Huttenbach, 1991). Rather, the point here is to provide an inclusive approach that recognizes all Gypsies’ and Travellers’ experiences of hate in the contemporary era, including, but not limited to, their experiences of racism.
The harms of hate
The theory of recognition (Yar, 2012) provides a useful framework to illustrate the harms of hate. In the first instance, it is necessary to consider the denial of recognition of the need for respect for Gypsies and Travellers. Lobbying by academics, policy makers, civil society and practitioners has meant that, of all the realms of recognition, there has been most recognition of Gypsies’ and Travellers’ needs in this area. As noted above, policy and legislation on both race hate behaviours and racially aggravated offending have recognized many Gypsies and Travellers as victims. Indeed, the acknowledgement of Gypsies and Travellers as marginalized communities has imbued contemporary reports and policy documents as noted above (and see, for example, Cemlyn et al., 2009; Lammy, 2017). The implementation of policies for Gypsy and Traveller inclusion has been slower in materializing, however (James and Smith, 2017), similar to the slow implementation of hate crime legislation generally (Mason, 2015). At the same time, the criminalization of Gypsies and Travellers continues unabated, as evidenced in the failure of local authorities to provide accommodation to Gypsies and Travellers at the same time as the Home Office announcement of proposed new powers for police to ‘crack down on illegal traveller sites’ (sic) (Home Office, 2019). While these new powers are couched within the language of accommodation provision, historically similar intentions have not been realized (Taylor, 2014). Hence, we see in practice the paradox for Gypsies and Travellers in England and Wales, wherein their needs are recognized via multiple policy and legislative mechanisms while also negated within that same arena via criminalization of their cultural nomadism. In addition, as noted above, the complexity of and inherent contradictions within definitions of Gypsy and Traveller identities in policy and legislation means that all Gypsies and Travellers are vulnerable in this context.
It is apparent from the above that two key issues arise. First, there has been a failure by policy makers to appreciate the multiplicity of Gypsy and Traveller cultures and communities in the UK and hence there is a lack of ‘joined up’ thinking regarding provision of statute. Second, essentialized notions of race and mobility have informed those statutes and thus exacerbated those misunderstandings. It has been argued elsewhere that the application of a ‘sedentarist binary’ (James and Southern, 2019: 324) definition of nomadism within contemporary policy has failed to appreciate the cultural nomadism of Gypsies and Travellers, but rather has reduced their cultures8 to their mobility. Gypsies and Travellers are racialized and experience racism in their everyday lives (Clark, 2006). However, to reduce Gypsy and Traveller identities to race and/or ethnicity, not only excludes significant populations, but also serves to augment essentialist perceptions of Gypsies and Travellers as the mythical Romany (Holloway, 2005) that excludes other ethnic groups of Gypsy and Traveller.
Here, it is important to note the way in which neoliberalism ‘has assembled its projects and interests from the field of issues saturated with race, with gender, with sex, with religion, with ethnicity and nationality’ (Duggan, 2012: xvi; see also Brown, 2015). Thus, the racialized mechanisms used to project hate on to Gypsies and Travellers, such as racist speech and language, exclusion from premises and criminalization, reflect those experienced by other minority communities (see Goldberg and Solomos, 2002). Respondents to the hate crime project referred to their experiences of racism in a number of ways: I don’t think they would have taken me to court if I wasn’t a gypsy girl.(Res 2.7)Been called a pikey.(Res 3.9)I am victimised because racism is tolerated.(Res 4.29)Gippo.(Res 2.1)
In addition, references to Gypsies and Travellers as analogous with ‘dirt’ (Sibley, 1988) were also evident in the research: Rubbish thrown at property.(Res 4.6)Called mud people.(Res 1.4)Bars of soap left [outside trailer].(Res 3.2)
Gypsies and Travellers interviewed were pertinently aware of the lack of respect given to them by those in authority. For example, respondents stated: We don’t matter to the authorities.(Res 4.3)When I deal with any kind of office, they reject me/turn me down.(Res 3.7)The government still seem to think its OK to treat me as a 3rd class citizen. . . I think they would love to complete their ‘ethnic cleansing’ plans.(Res 4.7, quotation marks in original)
It was unsurprising therefore, that the Gypsies and Travellers in the research had only reported 28% of the hate crimes they said they had experienced, compared to a national average of 51% for hate crime generally (Flately, 2018). Interestingly, those reports that had been made were to the police, rather than to third parties as might have been expected. The provision of 24 hour, third party reporting centres has served as a central plank of the hate crime agenda in the post-Macpherson era that acknowledged marginalized communities’ lack of confidence in police services (Macpherson, 1999). However, none of the Gypsies and Travellers in this research had reported any incidents or crimes to a third party, potentially suggesting the lack of faith in authorities’ reaches beyond the police for Gypsies and Travellers as evidenced in this research, noted above, by some reticence to complete the hate crime survey. Research has previously shown that Gypsies and Travellers lack trust in authorities generally due to the multi-agency approach used to manage them historically as a problem community (James and Richardson, 2006). This may explain their unwillingness to engage with third party reporting mechanisms. A hate crime reporting mechanism specifically for Gypsies and Travellers has been set up since the completion of this research study that has seen some significant reporting over the last two years (Thompson and Woodger, 2018).
Despite their occasional willingness to report hate incidents and crimes to the police, Gypsies and Travellers generally lacked confidence in the police, similar to other marginalized communities (Phillips and Bowling, 2017). Interactions with police constituted negative encounters as described by the Gypsies and Travellers in the research: Told by a policeman that people like us should be put against a wall and shot as there was no place for people like us in society.(Res 4.5)I suffered post-traumatic stress after an incident where the police raided a site I was living peacefully on. . .. The use of force to innocent people and children was shocking.(Res 3.3)
Overall then, the recognition of Gypsies’ and Travellers’ needs within policy and legislation evidences a positive step forward in delivering respect to those communities. However, a failure to embed a comprehensive appreciation of the variety of Gypsy and Traveller ethnicities and cultures has meant that their experiences overall are not recognized and they thus experience social harms that are systemic as policing authorities practise badly and lack legitimacy for Gypsies and Travellers. The hate crime agenda has a symbolic function to challenge prejudice through legislative means (Mason, 2013), but it fails in this regard by being exclusive in protecting some groups more than others and subsequently augmenting the hierarchy of deserving victims (Chakraborti and Garland, 2012). As such, the current hate crime agenda actually produces a symbolic social harm as Gypsies and Travellers are either placed at the bottom of the hierarchy of provision or are left out of its protective mechanisms.
Mason (2013) argues that hate crime legislation is reliant on victim communities’ capacity to elicit some form of compassion from wider society for its symbolic function to be realized. Given the extensive and historic racism faced by many Gypsies and Travellers, their ability to stimulate concern from the wider social world is highly unlikely in the first instance (Pew Research Center, 2014). Further, the contemporary neoliberal milieu of competitive individualism facilitates detachment, rather than empathy. Gypsies and Travellers then, exist within the precariat, wherein they must fight for access to resources among numerous other socially excluded (and disliked) people who are likewise trying to ascend the ladder of status hierarchy. The competition between Gypsies and Travellers and other minority communities was evident within the hate research project, as one respondent encapsulates here: ‘[There was] a petition in a shop nearby transit site. Racist in my view but, apparently not in the eyes of the police. I’m sure if it had been against Black/Asian minorities action would have been taken’ (Res 2.3).
In addition, competition between Gypsy and Traveller communities has previously been noted in research (Bhopal and Myers, 2008), with specific references to the problematization of New Travellers as illegitimate, despite having lived culturally nomadic lifestyles for generations (Clark, 1997). Beyond this, other Gypsies and Travellers have also competed for status within the hierarchies of provision and legitimacy. Greenfields (2006: 55) says, when there is significant pressure over sites, land usage and the level of discrimination and bad publicity that Travellers commonly experience, it is human nature that individuals will have a tendency to express the opinion that ‘it’s not Travellers like X, its Travellers of Y ethnicity who behave in this manner’. Accordingly a perceived hierarchy of ‘acceptable Travelling communities’ may be said to exist in the minds of the media, the public and, to some extent, of Gypsies and Travellers themselves.
The ‘human nature’ Greenfields refers to here, I would argue, relates to the subjective identity developed within the competitive and individualized norms of neoliberal capitalism. Indeed, the lack of site provision for Gypsies and Travellers, augmented by the closure of their traditional stopping places since the 1960s (Taylor, 2014), has meant that competition for spaces to stop and stay on has proliferated and been amplified by the cultural nomadism of New Travellers. Subsequent stigmatization of Gypsies and Travellers, alongside existing racism, has manifested within media and public perceptions, as well as within Gypsy and Traveller cultures themselves. Within this research, some Gypsies and Travellers referred to internal tensions between cultures: The problems I have had is from people on site. Prejudice from people on site.(Res 4.1)They want me off the site.(Res 2.42)
The lack of solidarity between people and communities that status hierarchies create (as noted by Hall et al., 1978), results in a failure of recognition of the human need for esteem. With no effective symbolic order for humans to acknowledge each other within, that is respectful of their similarities and differences, the capacity for human flourishing is diminished. This research evidenced the low esteem that Gypsies and Travellers are held in by wider society. The 79 people who completed the survey reported a total of 225 hate incidents or crimes committed against them on the basis of their identity as a Gypsy or Traveller. Bias-motivated incidents they experienced included hate speech through name calling (81% of respondents), general bullying (71% of respondents) and serious threats and intimidation (29% of respondents), including sexualized intimidation, harassment and unwanted photography and filming. Bias-motivated crimes they experienced included minor damage to property (30% of respondents), serious damage to property (20% of respondents), minor physical assault (20% of respondents) and serious physical assault (15% of respondents). Other offences experienced were, burglary, theft, stone throwing, brick throwing, being shot at and arson (overall 19% of respondents).
One interview from the research reveals Gypsies’ and Travellers’ lived experience of fear and insecurity, the difficulty to find a space to stop and stay on and their inability to rely on others for help or support: In the past Sandra* has experienced extensive bullying and abuse due to being a Traveller. She has been banned from launderettes, pubs and shops and her living vehicles have been subject to criminal damage. Most recently, she was invited to occupy a particular place by a landowner, which appeared an opportunity to provide space for herself and other Travellers to settle for a period. She had not been to the locality before and there were no available legitimate stopping sites in the vicinity. She felt that this invitation to occupy farmland equated to a safe place to stop. One afternoon, not long after their arrival, around 30 local farmers, armed with shotguns, turned up at the site telling the Travellers to move on and threatening that if they had not left by the end of the day, they would return at night. Given that the Travellers felt they had been given the right to stay on the land by the landowner, that it was a group of four families with a total of nine young children aged 5 to 9, and they were unfamiliar with anywhere else to go, the Travellers stayed on the site. The threat of the farmers returning meant that the Travellers were fearful for their children. These fears were made worse by their previous negative experiences of ill-treatment by gorgers (non-Gypsies). The Travellers were so fearful that they arranged escape routes from the site and hiding places for the children in case the farmers should return. This involved placing sheepskin rugs over barbed wire fences and placing duvets, torches and food in secluded hiding spots nearby.(Int notes S, *pseudonym)
In this circumstance, it transpired that the landowner had an ulterior motive for the Travellers’ occupation of his land, as he was using their presence to place pressure on the local authority to agree a previously refused planning application for a building on his land. Not only then are Gypsies and Travellers perceived as problematic within communities, they are also in this instance considered to serve a purpose as a consequence of the lack of esteem held for them by sedentary communities and authorities alike. Suggestions that this simply represents a clash between nomadism and sedentarism (Levinson and Sparkes, 2004) would be to reduce appreciations of nomadism to mobility, and would negate the fact that mobility has been largely embraced in contemporary society, when it has served the interests of profit (James and Channing, 2019). Indeed, the caravanning industry, that serves the seasonal use of caravans and parks for people to holiday, has burgeoned in the late 20th century and caravan sites for holidaymakers cover the countryside where this research was completed.
The extensive subjective, systemic and symbolic harms detailed above place Gypsies and Travellers in fear of their and their families’ safety. The insecurity of everyday life in contemporary neoliberal society manifests acutely within, and is exacerbated by, the precarity of Gypsies’ and Travellers’ lived experience. Within such circumstances it is unsurprising that Gypsies and Travellers commonly hide their identity from those in authority and others outside of their community (James, 2007). In doing so, however, they risk further harms to themselves and the primary interpersonal relationships they have. Recognition of the human need for love is essential for human beings to thrive and thus its negation is highly problematic. Within the hate research project, a number of parents noted the trouble caused to their children when they identified them as from Gypsy and Traveller homes: School said they had a vacancy for our youngest daughter until I said where we lived and was then told they made a mistake and didn’t have any vacancies.(Res 2.8)I did take my daughter out of Year 7 because of bullying related to her living in vehicles.(Res 3.7)
The failure to recognize a loved one’s identity is to negate their cultural inheritance and their sense of self, causing harm to them as they develop their subjectivity in relation to those that care for them most. This symbolic harm is augmented by wider society’s exclusion of Gypsies and Travellers and essentialism of their cultures, as noted above. Powell (2008) suggests that Gypsies and Travellers utilize their limited agency through tactically circumventing social controls placed on them. Indeed, within this research, some participants evidenced their resilience to hateful behaviours through averting their impact: [I don’t report] because I don’t identify as a victim.(Res 4.53)[Victimization is] just general assumptions based on stereotypes, easily turned around via the provision of info in response to ignorance, always a positive game changer .(Res 5.6)
This is not to suggest that Gypsies and Travellers are not subject to social forces, but rather that they retain their cultural integrity through tactics of aversion that have resulted in resilience, similar to participants in research by Williams and Tregidga (2014). This means that Gypsies and Travellers live separately from wider society of their own volition, as well as as a consequence of their exclusion. While their laudable attempts to resist the oppression of others means that they can occasionally exist beyond the reach of control agencies, this also means that they can exist beyond the reach of other, supportive agencies. Further, it results in the amplification of the cultural essentialism imposed upon them. This means that effective resolution of domestic and community problems is not facilitated, as Gypsies and Travellers lack confidence to report such matters and support agencies are fearful to broach them. Apart from progressive work carried out by civil society organizations, there is barely any research on domestic violence, homophobia, transphobia or inter-community anti-Gypsyism within Gypsy and Traveller communities. Given the rates of such issues in wider society, it behoves us to consider how to breach this gap to ensure that Gypsies and Travellers attain recognition of their need for love.
Conclusion
This article has identified the breadth of hate harms Gypsies and Travellers experience within contemporary neoliberal capitalism. By using a critical hate studies approach, it has been possible to provide an inclusive analysis that recognizes the lived experience of hate for all Gypsies and Travellers. The article has therefore set out how critically informed scholarship on hate can inform knowledge in two ways. First, it can facilitate criminology to move beyond existing debates in studies of race and ethnicity via the inclusion of Gypsies and Travellers within discussion where they have previously been negated (see, for example, Spalek, 2008). Second, it enables criminological engagement with the wider social sciences, specifically psychology and sociology, to examine the impact of neoliberal capitalism on human relations generally, while ensuring acknowledgement of the nuanced experiences of minority communities. Notwithstanding existing research on microaggressions (see, for example, Hughey et al., 2017; Sue, 2010), a key area of concern within hate studies has been the apparent inability of critical theory to explain the everyday nature of hate, as well as extreme hate behaviours committed against multiple communities. Scholarship in this area has vacillated around the concept of hate itself, whom to protect within policy and legislation, and how to challenge increased levels of hatefulness in contemporary society. This article proposes a rehabilitation of the notion of hate through the lens of social harm. It has been evidenced here that Gypsies and Travellers experience hostility towards them on the basis of their identity and thus, the necessity to examine and theorize hate is important and relevant, as is the development and implementation of statute to challenge hateful behaviours. Indeed, some protections against race hate are in place, however existing protective frameworks simply serve as silos that can be breached but commonly are not, due to a lack of solidarity between and within marginalized communities and wider society. While the capacity of this article does not allow a full consideration of policy development, and further research is required, it is worth noting the need for more than piecemeal policy and legislative changes that only have the capacity to address specific hateful behaviours (Brown, 2015). A critical hate studies perspective suggests that hate studies could expedite a comprehensive and effective approach to positive praxis through recognition of the human need to flourish. In doing so, a positive discourse would develop that focused on what should, rather than should not, be experienced (Hall and Winlow, 2015). It would then be possible to create a policy and practice environment that effectively acknowledges that race matters, but which also acknowledges the intersectional nature of our identities and the harmful subjectivities engendered within contemporary neoliberal society.

ATLANTA — In the most recent killing of a transgender woman, her body was found inside an abandoned car, burned beyond recognition. In another case, the woman was pulled from a lake at a Dallas park. And in a third, she was found dead near a golf course, just weeks after she survived a brutal beating that was captured on video.
In the United States this year, at least 18 transgender people — most of them transgender women of color — have been killed in a wave of violence that the American Medical Association has declared an “epidemic.” The killings, which have been reported across the country, have for some prompted a heightened sense of vigilance. 
“It’s always in the forefront of our minds, when we’re leaving home, going to work, going to school,” said Kayla Gore, who lives in Memphis. “Guys were flirting with me at the gas station, and the first thought was, ‘This could go horribly wrong.’”
Activists said the cases have also underscored the precarious position of many in a community that faces elevated levels of homelessness and poverty, and the hazards that can bring. 
The killings this year follow at least 26 recorded last year by the Human Rights Campaign. But transgender advocates noted that those figures fail to grasp the full extent of the perils the community faces, as data provided by law enforcement officials can be incomplete and many crimes are never reported.
The paucity of reliable data makes it difficult to measure whether violence against transgender people has increased. But many advocates say that hostility has intensified, as a rise in visibility has also stirred animosity and emboldened people to attack. 
The climate of fear reflects a widening gulf in the acceptance of transgender groups, which today have far more representation in popular culture. There are transgender or gender-nonconforming characters on television and in movies, and Mattel recently introduced a line of gender-neutral dolls. Yet that cultural progress has not trickled down to everyday life, particularly for those who are the most vulnerable. 
“We are the most afraid we’ve ever been,” said Mariah Moore, a program associate for the Transgender Law Center, who lives in New Orleans. “But we’re also stronger than we’ve ever been.”
Many transgender people said they have hunkered down, avoiding meeting people they do not know and sticking to places where they will have greater odds of staying safe. 
“A lot of folks are living in silos,” Ms. Gore said.
Between May and July — when pride events were taking place across the country — at least 14 L.G.B.T.Q. people were killed, according to a report from the Anti-Violence Project. Seven of the victims were black transgender women. 
“The increased visibility is a signal for them that they need to double down in fighting back,” Beverly Tillery, the executive director of the Anti-Violence Project in New York, said of those looking to harm transgender people. “We’re definitely seeing what we would call a backlash.”
The dangers, of course, extend beyond explicit bias crimes. Discrimination can stand in the way of housing, education and job prospects, pushing many transgender people into homelessness as well as into sex work, elevating risks to their safety. And for black transgender women, racism can compound the discrimination.
“The prejudices don’t add upon one another, they multiply upon one another,” said Sarah McBride, the national press secretary for the Human Rights Campaign.
Police departments have hired more L.G.B.T.Q. officers and have sought to mend strained relationships, but advocates say many transgender people avoid calling the police if they are threatened or even physically attacked.
Dana Martin, 31, was the first known transgender person killed in 2019, found shot to death in a vehicle in Montgomery, Ala., in January.
Since then, three transgender women have been killed in Dallas, including Muhlaysia Booker, a 23-year-old who was shot to death about a month after being brutally assaulted in an unrelated attack that was captured on video and garnered national attention. Another transgender woman in Dallas was shot several times last week and gravely wounded in an attack that the authorities are investigating as a hate crime. 
In Detroit in June, an 18-year-old man was charged with first-degree murder for the targeted killings of a transgender woman, Paris Cameron, and two gay men. 
The most recent killing, at least the 18th, took place near Clewiston, Fla. The body of Bee Love Slater, 23, was found in a scorched car on Sept. 4, her body so badly burned that she had to be identified with dental records. 
The series of killings has mobilized transgender and L.G.B.T.Q. groups, with calls for lawmakers to strengthen hate crime legislation and bar the use of the so-called gay- or trans-panic defense for people charged with attacks. They have also organized self-defense classes and guides on where to find affirming places to eat and shop. 
The violence against transgender women has been cited by several Democratic presidential candidates, including Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, and Julián Castro, the former housing secretary. At a candidates forum on L.G.B.T.Q. issues in Iowa last week, Senator Elizabeth Warren read aloud the names of those who have been killed this year. 
“We do not talk enough about trans Americans, especially trans African-Americans and the especially high rates of murder right now,” Mr. Booker said on Twitter after the Democratic debate in Miami in June. “It’s not enough just to be on the Equality Act. We need to have a president who will fight to protect L.G.B.T.Q. Americans every day.”
Jennicet Gutiérrez, a national community organizer for Familia: Trans Queer Liberation Movement, said she has had moments when people felt entitled to question her identity or insult her with transphobic comments. Some had threatened her with guns, she said, “or at times, they get very physical.”
“Fortunately,” she continued, “I have experience with those sort of attacks and have been able to survive and been able to organize my community and speak up and really challenge these injustices.”
Ms. Moore said she felt a call to action in 2017, after Chyna Gibson, a 31-year-old black transgender woman, was fatally shot in New Orleans. Ms. Moore, 31, said the killing in her hometown rattled her. 
Even so, she was already deeply aware of the risks she and other transgender people face. She recounted the time, in 2014, when she was attacked and had to leap from a third-story window to save herself, shattering her knees.
“I want us to live in a world,” she said, “where we don’t have to worry about walking out of our front doors and being killed because someone doesn’t understand who we are.”
Rick Rojas reported from Atlanta, and Vanessa Swales from New York.

https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FBusinessInsiderToday%2Fvideos%2F1740348646140739%2F&#38;show;_text=false&#38;width;=734&#38;height;=411&#38;appId;[2] Small businesses in Manhattan's Chinatown have survived weeklong closures following disasters like 9/11 and Hurricane Sandy. But those hard times don't compare to the months of dwindling business the neighborhood is experiencing from the coronavirus pandemic.Chinatown small businesses report losses of 60% to 80% as early as February from a decline of customers that happened before New York City's first confirmed COVID-19 case and the city's mandatory lockdown in March.""Since there is a misunderstanding that the virus was brought to the US from China, a lot of people did not want to be in or around Chinatown, or even eat Chinese food,"" said Chuen Ping Hui, owner and executive chef of Ping's seafood restaurant.While New York City recently lifted its restrictions on outdoor dining, Chinatown restaurants are still contending with a lack of visitors.""New York City now, it's quite clear that we no longer have the 66 million visitors from international tourism,"" said Wellington Chen, executive director of Chinatown Partnership.The organization helps maintain cleanliness and safety in the neighborhood, which are more necessary than ever.""The demand on you is higher because of the additional cost of the shield, the masks, the sanitizers, the air filtration, HEPA equipment that has never been in your formula,"" Chen said. ""And that's never in your budget, but meantime, your customers are down this much.""To attract customers, the nonprofit Chinatown Partnership[3] has been helping Ping's and other local businesses set up outdoor seating arrangements for the summer, in the form of collapsible tents, tables, chairs, and planters.Ping's is one of the area's small businesses that operates on thin profit margins and relies on a steady stream of both locals and tourists. When that stream dropped off in mid-March, Hui made a tough decision.""Once March 15 came around, the business for March was down by 80%. I did not see a future,"" Hui said. ""Chinatown was quiet. I had no choice but to [temporarily] close the business.""Ping's reopened in early June with delivery and takeout service only, but for a fine dining restaurant accustomed to serving as many as 150 people indoors, the setup was less than ideal. The restaurant added a small outdoor space in late June, but it only fits around 20 diners, and it's often empty on weekdays.Amid the pandemic and an economic downturn, Asian Americans are fighting racism and a stigma that they're to blame for the virus.In March, the FBI warned of a rise in hate crimes[4] against Asian Americans. And since March 19, the website Stop AAPI Hate[5] has received 2,373 anonymous incident reports of hate and discrimination toward Asians in the US.The Stop AAPI Hate reporting center found that verbal harassment makes up 70% to 80% of the incidents and there's been a rise in physical incidents, such as spitting or coughing on Asian people.""We shifted really quickly from being 'crazy rich Asians' and the 'model minority' to being 'crazy infected Asians' and being the perpetual foreigner,"" said Russell Jeung, founder of Stop AAPI Hate and chair of Asian American Studies at San Francisco State University. As Chinatown suffers, hate crimes against Asians are rising in the US. President Donald Trump has reinforced the harmful racial stigma by saying ""Kung flu"" and ""China virus"" when referring to COVID-19[6].""The president's insistence on using the term 'Chinese virus' really makes the situation worse,"" Jeung said. ""We noticed that after he began to repeatedly use that term, a clear spike in hate speech circulating on the internet and acts of violence against Asian Americans.""Chen, the Chinatown Partnership director, said the attacks threaten not just Chinese people, but all Asians.""Unfortunately you have a ripple effect affecting Malaysians, Singaporeans, Vietnamese, people from the Philippines,"" he said. ""As long as you have an Asian face, you then become associated with this virus.""The stigma has been detrimental to Asian American small businesses: 233,000 have closed[7] across the country from February to April, a loss of 28%.To support small businesses in their neighborhood, Victoria Lee and Jennifer Tam started the grassroots organization Welcome to Chinatown in March. The organization has several initiatives, including a partnership with small businesses to create merchandise[8], with revenue going directly to the businesses.""Chinatown doesn't need saving in the sense that there's an impassioned community,"" Lee said. ""We're only one of a handful of different grassroots initiatives that have come out of the pandemic.""One of its early fundraisers, Feed Our Heroes[9], involved purchasing meals from local eateries and delivering them to essential workers. The group has served more than 16,000 meals in 11 weeks.To extend assistance beyond food-related businesses, Welcome to Chinatown ended that program in June and recently launched the Longevity Fund[10], a $200,000 fundraiser to alleviate overhead costs for 40 small local businesses.""It's just really hard to see a time and place where Chinatown isn't where it was before in a post-COVID world,"" Tam said.In the meantime, Chen is encouraging people to visit when the neighborhood needs it most.""Please come down here to show your support, whether by just your physical presence, buying a $1 item, or just walking the street. It helps a lot,"" Chen said. ""Chinatown is, to the credit of everyone involved, very, very resilient. These are tough fighters.""

Congressman Max Rose, along with State Senator Andrew Gounardes, Council Member Justin Brannan, and the Office of Assembly Member Peter Abbate, Jr., today hosted a virtual roundtable with Chinese-American community and business leaders to discuss efforts to support small businesses and the community through the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including against rising xenophobia and discrimination.
“What has been happening in the past few months in terms of skyrocketing hate crimes and xenophobia against the Chinese- and Asian-American community as a result of COVID is not only disgusting, it’s reprehensible and must utilize every tool at the federal, state, and city level to crack down on it,” Rose said. “As we talk about the economy, there’s no secret that restaurants owned by Asian-Americans were some of the first to shut down. They need our help and I’m continuing to fight to ensure they have the relief and help they need and deserve.”
During the roundtable, Rose announced his support and co-sponsorship of the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which was introduced by fellow New York City Congressmember Grace Meng. The legislation seeks to provide greater federal government oversight of COVID-19 hate crimes, and require the Department of Justice (DOJ) to provide Congress with regular updates on the status of reported bias incidents.
Since the beginning of the crisis, there have been numerous reports of Asian-Americans being threatened, harassed, or assaulted. The pandemic has also fueled a rise in anti-Semitic incidents against the Jewish community, and has had adverse impacts on the LGBTQ community. As a result, these communities, in addition to working to combat the coronavirus, are left fighting an additional front—that of hate and injustice.
Rose has continued to fight for and prioritize the needs of small businesses. Earlier this month, the bipartisan Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act, which Rose co-sponsored, was signed into law and included many critical fixes for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). Following Congress passing additional funding for relief programs to help businesses and nonprofits, Rose called on four of the leading banks to prioritize the truly small businesses that are hurting most over larger corporations and businesses. Rose also testified before the House Committee on Small Business urging more safeguards to ensure federal funding goes to small and minority-owned businesses and nonprofits that need them most."

The footage shows the officers in riot gear pushing 75-year-old Martin Gugino who had approached a line of police clearing demonstrators from a public square in Buffalo, upstate New York, as an 8pm curfew came into force.
The man falls backward and hits his head on the pavement. Blood leaks onto the floor as police walk past.
Buffalo police initially said in a statement that a person was injured when he ""tripped and fell,"" but then opened an internal investigation after the video emerged.
The two officers involved have now been suspended, but Mr Cuomo called for them to be fired and criminal charges brought. According to a local news report, 56 officers from Buffalo's police force-making up its entire emergency response team-on Friday resigned in solidarity with their suspended colleagues.
Mr Cuomo, who played the ""utterly disgraceful"" footage which made him ""physically sick"" to reporters gathered for a press conference in Albany, said he had spoken to the victim, who was recovering from a concussion and in a serious but stable condition.
The progressive governor said he was pushing for the state to pass new legislation under the Say Their Name reform agenda package scheduled to be heard next week.
He said he wanted to see police disciplinary records made transparent, for officers to be banned from using chokeholds on suspects and for the Attorney General to act as independent prosecutor for any police murder cases.
He also said ""false"" 9/11 calls based on a person's race should be considered a hate crime.
""It is in all of our interest to stop police abuse. Stopping police abuse vindicates the overwhelming majority of good police,"" he said. ""It restores trust. It restores safety.
""For the sake of our communities, we must do this.""
Elsewhere, the city of Minneapolis on Friday night agreed with the state to ban the use of chokeholds by police and to require police to report and intervene anytime they see an unauthorised use of force by another officer. 
There have been unprecedented scenes of violence up and down the country this past week, footage of which has shocked Americans.
The New York Police Department, in particular, has come under intense criticism for its heavy-handed tactics in putting down largely peaceful protesters demonstrating against police brutality.
With more than 2,000 arrests, the state is responsible for more than a fifth of the total number of arrests made across the country since protests began 10 days ago.
 This delivery guy thought he's an essential worker, police seemed to disagree. The rules issued before the curfew very unclear but according to the state, restaurants, bar & food industry workers are classified as essential. #nycurfew #NYCPolice pic.twitter.com/OyZVuDkPuM- Kirsti Karttunen (@KirstiKarttunen) June 5, 2020
On Thursday night, police used batons against protesters who had been marching in downtown Brooklyn after the curfew. Videos showed officers handcuffing doctors, nurses and delivery drivers, despite officials stating essential workers were exempt.
President Donald Trump on Friday gave his first public address in five days, briefly mentioning the unrest but declining to take questions. 
He put his finger to his lips when asked by one African-American journalist about the protests. 
""Nobody's ever done for the black community what President Trump is doing,"" he told reporters at the White House's Rose Garden as he congratulated himself on encouraging new employment figures.
""Hopefully, George (Floyd) is looking down right now and saying, 'This is a great thing happening for our country',"" Mr Trump said. ""A great day for him, a great day for everybody. This is a great day for everybody."""

Reports that a noose had been found Sunday in the garage of Bubba Wallace, NASCAR s only Black driver, generated outrage, but it apparently was a garage door pull rope and had been in the garage for months before Wallace s team began to use it, the FBI and NASCAR said Tuesday.
KEY FACTS
Thenoosewas spotted Sunday evening in Wallace s garage the night before a race at Talladega Superspeedway, one of NASCAR s most well-known tracks.
The discovery quickly sparked outrage and an outpouring of support for Wallace, who had successfully pushed recently for a ban ofConfederate flagdisplays at NASCAR tracks.
But the FBI, which had launched an investigation into potential hate crimes, ruled out bringing any charges Tuesday,sayingthat after conducting interviews and reviewing video, they found that the object had actually been in the garage possibly since at least October of 2019, and that nobody could have known Mr. Wallace would be assigned to garage number 4 last week. 
It was actually a garage door pull rope that was fashioned like a noose, NASCAR said in astatement.
CRITICAL QUOTE
 We appreciate the FBI s quick and thorough investigation and are thankful to learn that this was not an intentional, racist act against Bubba, NASCAR said. We remain steadfast in our commitment to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all who love racing. 
KEY BACKGROUND
Noose sightingshave raised alarm around the nation after protests following the death of George Floyd have put American race relations back in the spotlight. Over the past week, nooses have been found in public in places like California, New York and Maine, some of which have prompted hate crime investigations.
TANGENT
Wallace has competed on NASCAR s top circuit since 2018, and currently drives the number 43 car a famous number in the sport that formerly belonged to Richard Petty. Wallace finished in 14th at the Geico 500 Monday at Talladega.

Just before Palm Sunday and Easter, liberal mayors and governors shut down churches while allowing big box stores, marijuana dispensaries, and abortion clinics to remain open. Overwhelmingly, churches complied, although I wish they hadn't. Now the left is coming for Thanksgiving.Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot is calling on residents of her city to 'cancel traditional Thanksgiving plans.' California Governor Gavin Newsom issued an absurd decree severely restricting Thanksgiving gatherings. 
Governor Andrew Cuomo issued a similar order and suggested that if police see evidence of more than 10 people in a house, they should knock on the door and act accordingly. Some New York sheriffs are refusing to enforce the governor's order. Joe Biden was asked what his advice for Thanksgiving was. He said that family gatherings should be limited to a 'maximum [of] 10 people, socially distanced, wearing masks, and people who have quarantined.' As we approach Thanksgiving and Christmas, I hope more churches will resist these outrageous shutdown orders. There is little evidence that the shutdowns actually do much to change the course of the disease. Beyond that, there are hidden agendas here. To tell a church which can seat 1,000 people that it cannot have more than 25 at a service is irrational. It's so irrational that it suggests there is something else at play. The tendency of the Church to collapse in front of this pressure, because we're told it is an emergency, is setting a dangerous precedent. We have had bad flu seasons that kill 80,000 people. Will churches be asked to shut down for the flu in the future? The next time a jihadist group threatens to attack a church or synagogue, will they be ordered to shut down because the experts say the best way to save lives is to close? And what Bible verses are people relying on for this kind of reasoning? Christians in many parts of the world regularly go to church knowing there are huge risks involved. The church could be blown up or set on fire. They could be gunned down leaving church. Chinese Christians go to church every Sunday knowing that facial recognition technology installed by the godless Chinese Communist Party is recording them. As a result, their children may not be able to go to college or they may be arrested in the middle of the night by state police. It is time for American Christians to do a gut check. If a church decides to shut down, it should send a letter to government officials at all levels saying they are doing so voluntarily in the best interest of the congregation, but that local officials have no legal authorit to close the church. As Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito recently warned, COVID restrictions are creating 'previously unimaginable restrictions on individual liberty,' especially religious liberty. But the Constitution is still the supreme law of the land, and the First Amendment still guarantees religious liberty. Biden's Agenda Joe Biden held a press conference Monday, and it was very revealing. He took several questions from friendly reporters, an old tactic of the Obama White House to control the media. And the media willingly complied. Many of the questions were softballs that set up Biden to attack Donald Trump. Get used to it. What was also evident Monday is that anybody who thought they were electing a moderate needs to think again. For example, Biden is considering appointing one of the teachers' unions leaders as his secretary of education. If you think you're frustrated about what the public schools are doing now, just wait! A member of Biden's transition team, and a rumored nominee to be secretary of the Treasury, is an aggressive supporter of reparations. That means you, who have never owned slaves, will give money to someone who never was a slave to atone for something that happened more than 150 years ago. Sure, that will bring the country together! Biden also suggested that he wants to immediately forgive student loan debt. Senate Democrat Leader Chuck Schumer is pressuring Biden to eliminate as much as $50,000 of debt per student via executive order. Translation: All of you who worked two jobs to pay off your student loans will be instantly turned into suckers. And all of you who currently have student loan debt who think it won't cost you anything to have it forgiven should have taken an economics class in college. There's no such thing as 'free money.' You and every other taxpayer will pay for this debt in higher taxes.Much is being made about the split in the Democrat Party between the woke socialists and the rest of the party. In my view this divide is being overblown. By now, in the heart of virtually every Democrat there is a socialist yearning to show himself.The split is between those like AOC who want to proudly promote their socialism and those like Obama and Biden who want to camouflage it so people won't understand what is happening to them.By the way, Biden condemned the violence in Washington, DC, this weekend, but he did not condemn any specific organization like antifa or Black Lives Matter. And while Biden was concerned about the violence, he was also concerned about the 'displays of white supremacy' during the march. What is he talking about? Oh, that's right, the left thinks MAGA hats are racist. Fighting Anti-Semitism The FBI has released its latest report on hate crimes in America, and once again Jews are the primary targets of hate crimes. Even though Jews make up less than 2% of the population, more than 60% of religiously motivated hate crimes that were reported to the FBI in 2019 were anti-Semitic. Sadly, the number of anti-Semitic hate crimes has surged 56% over the past five years. Not even making the FBI's hate crimes list is the treatment of Orthodox Jews at the hands of New York progressives, most notably Mayor Bill de Blasio and his army of bureaucrats. The Orthodox Jewish community is being treated worse than almost anyone else.The same progressive mayor who applauds mass demonstrations in the streets has aggressively tried to prevent Orthodox Jews from attending the funerals of respected leaders. This is blatant anti-Semitism. Orthodox Jews are in the same category as faithful Catholics in New York. They are sympathetic to conservatives on the sanctity of life and the family, and it is payback time. The Empire State government is going to be in their faces on everything it can. Of course, anti-Semitism isn't new. This ancient evil has existed since the beginning of recorded history. But it has often been said that Jews are the canary in the coal mine, and anti-Semitism is a sign of a growing sickness in society. Anti-Semitism is a sin, and it must be condemned whenever and wherever it rears its ugly head. Read and Listen to more great articles at The Patriot Post[2].

The allegations are the latest twist in a dizzying swirl of claims and counter-claims in the case that began in January 2019 when Smollett, who is black and openly gay, told police he was accosted on a darkened street in a hate crime by two masked strangers.
Smollett was initially charged in a 16-count indictment with falsifying the incident. But the Cook County State's Attorney's Office dismissed the case three weeks later on March 26, 2019, drawing an outcry from police and city officials.
In his report, the counsel, former U.S. Attorney Dan Webb, cleared the State's Attorney's Office of any criminal activity or claims that it responded to improper outside influence when it dropped the hoax charges against Smollett.
Webb's report said, however, that he ""did develop evidence that establishes substantial abuses of discretion and operational failures by the (State's Attorney's Office) in prosecuting and resolving the initial Smollett case.""
Webb also said county prosecutors, including State's Attorney Kim Foxx who recused herself from the Smollett case, made false statements that may violate state legal ethics rules.
The State's Attorney's Office rejected Webb's claim, adding that it never deliberately issued inaccurate statements. But in an email, the office noted it had already made a number of changes, including hiring an ethics officer.
Webb was appointed by a Cook County judge last year as a special prosecutor to review the handling of the case. In the course of his review, Webb filed renewed hoax-related charges against Smollett, to which the actor pleaded not guilty on Feb. 24.
Smollett lost his role as a singer-songwriter in ""Empire,"" a Fox television hip-hop drama, after the accusations he had filed a false report. (Reporting by Peter Szekely in New York; Editing by Dan Grebler and Tom Brown) !@COPYRIGHT=© 2020 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights reserved."

Gillibrand:
Today, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand announced the Senate passage of the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism Act of 2019 (S.238, H.R. 221), a bipartisan and bicameral bill that would enhance the State Department's role in combating and monitoring anti-Semitism across the globe. Gillibrand was joined by Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL) Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Cory Gardner (R-CO), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) as original co-sponsors of the bill.
The bill now heads to the U.S. House of Representatives for consideration.
""As we have seen far too often, anti-Semitism is an urgent threat in New York State, our country, and across the world,"" said Senator Gillibrand. ""We must do everything in our power to confront, and end, this growing danger. I am proud that we were able to pass this bipartisan bill to elevate the position of special envoy to the rank of ambassador in order to ensure that the State Department can monitor and help combat anti-Semitism across the globe. I will always stand with the Jewish community, and fight against hatred and prejudice in all its forms.""
Gillibrand recently led a bipartisan push to increase funding to help protect nonprofit institutions against terror attacks, calling for up to $360 million for the Nonprofit Security Grant Program. Gillibrand previously secured $90 million in NSGP funding in 2019 and $60 million in NSGP funding in 2018. The funding allocated by this program will support non-profit organizations most at risk of terror attacks through the acquisition and installation of physical target hardening measures, related preparedness and prevention planning, training, and exercises, and contracted security personnel so that religious and community based organizations have the critical resources and tools they need to protect lives and property. According to a recent FBI report on hate crime statistics in 2019, 60.2% were victims of crimes motivated by offenders' anti-Jewish bias.
The Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism Act will:
Elevate the position of special envoy to monitor and combat anti-Semitism to the rank of ambassador;
Direct the special envoy to report directly to the secretary of state;
Prohibit the special envoy from being double-hatted with another portfolio of issues;
Emphasize that the special envoy should be a person of recognized distinction in the field of combating anti-Semitism or religious freedom; and
Clarify that the special envoy shall be the primary advisor and coordinator for U.S. government efforts to monitor and combat anti-Semitism and anti-Semitic incitement in foreign countries."

In 1964, civil rights activist Malcolm X declared, “We want equality by any means necessary” during the Founding Rally of the Organization of Afro-American Unity in New York.
In 1968, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Uniform Monday Holiday Bill, which moved commemorations for Washington’s Birthday, Memorial Day and Veterans Day to Monday, creating three-day holiday weekends beginning in 1971.
In 1975, screenwriter, producer and actor Rod Serling, 50, creator of “The Twilight Zone,” died in Rochester, New York.
In 1978, the Supreme Court ordered the University of California-Davis Medical School to admit Allan Bakke (BAH’-kee), a white man who argued he’d been a victim of reverse racial discrimination.
In 1994, President Bill Clinton became the first chief executive in U.S. history to set up a personal legal defense fund and ask Americans to contribute to it.
In 2000, seven months after he was cast adrift in the Florida Straits, Elian Gonzalez was returned to his native Cuba.
In 2013, tens of thousands of supporters and opponents of President Mohammed Morsi rallied in Cairo, and both sides fought each other in Egypt’s second-largest city of Alexandria, where two people — including an American — were killed and scores injured. The four plaintiffs in the U.S. Supreme Court case that overturned California’s same-sex marriage ban tied the knot, just hours after a federal appeals court freed gay couples to obtain marriage licenses in the state for the first time in 4 1/2 years.

Five years ago: Authorities in upstate New York captured David Sweat, one of two convicted murderers who’d escaped from the Clinton Correctional Facility on June 6; Sweat was apprehended two days after his fellow escapee, Richard Matt, was shot and killed in a confrontation with law enforcement. After 18 straight successful launches, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket broke apart minutes after soaring away from Cape Canaveral, Florida, while carrying supplies for the International Space Station. Comedian Jack Carter, 93, died in Beverly Hills, California.
One year ago: Avowed white supremacist James Alex Fields, who deliberately drove his car into a crowd of counterprotesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing a young woman and injuring dozens, apologized to his victims before being sentenced to life in prison on federal hate crime charges. President Donald Trump joked with Russian President Vladimir Putin about interfering in U.S. elections as the two met on the sidelines of an international summit in Japan.

But for the first time, LGBT members revealed the unhinged they suffered. There were spontaneous demonstrations and riots and that revolt gave rise to the march of pride. It began in New York, joined Los Angeles and is now held in several cities around the world in the days after June 28.
In Buenos Aires the first march also coincided with those days: it was July 2, 1992. The organizers were Carlos Jáuregui and César Cigliutti, two leaders of the Argentine Homosexual Community (CHA). 300 people participated, most with faces covered in masks so they wouldn't recognize them. They asked for ""Freedom, Equality, Diversity.""
Over the years, the date of the Pride March ran to November. Although last year if there was a march, but not the Pride one: it was a demonstration against the cross-dressing,from Plaza de Mayo to the National Congress in Buenos Aires.
The reason why the Pride March is held in November in our country,is related to a local milestone of the homosexual movement,still before Stonewall.
In a month of November 1967 the first group of sexual diversity of the country and of Latin America was born: Our World. This collective invited gay liberation and, in the 1970s, it became the Homosexual Liberation Front (FLH). His political manifesto was ""Sex and Revolution"" and his main references, Nestor Perlongher and Manuel Puig.
The date of this year was not yet announced by the committee that organizes it, and which brings together different entities that reflect all the diversity. But it is estimated to be between the second and third Saturdays of November.
As a preview, some organizations hold celebrations for Pride Day these days to claim that there are no more hate crimes against a collective that still awaits vindication of their most basic rights."

The alleged poisoning comes as anti-cop sentiment increases as George Floyd protests continue and demands to defund the police grow
The NYPD are investigating a potential hate crime, in the suspected poisoning of three officers at a New York Shake Shack. 
The officers - members of the Bronx's 42nd Precinct assigned to protest detail - had fallen sick after consuming food from the Shake Shack on Broadway and Fulton Street in downtown Manhattan Monday night at about 8.30pm.
It is believed that one of the restaurant employee may have contaminated the officer's milkshakes with bleach. 
The three officers were rushed to Bellevue Hospital where they are being treated. They are currently in stable condition, according to reports. 
Sources told the New York Daily News that prior to falling ill, the officers noticed their shakes tasted strange. One of the officers reportedly noticed a 'clump of something' in their cups, while another smelled bleach. 
Officers spent several hours collecting evidence at the Shake Shack. Samples of the milkshakes have been taken for testing. 
NYPD officers were also seen searching through garbage cans outside the building where the Shake Shack is located, while standing guard over milkshakes - believed to be the ones the officers threw out after drinking them - on the sidewalk. 
Sources told CBS New York that employees at the downtown Shake Shack are being interviewed but no arrests have been made. 
The New York Daily News reported that shortly after midnight, three Shake Shack workers - two men and a woman - were escorted to a NYPD van belonging to the ill officers' 42nd Precinct. 
It's unclear if they were under arrest, but they were not handcuffed when taken to the van. 
Investigators found a bottle of cleaning fluid that had been used to clean the shake machines, but that it was unclear if the officers had been purposely targeted, the newspaper reported. 
The NYPD has officially only said that the officers fell ill, possibly after drinking milkshakes from the restaurant, were taken to the hospital and that they are investigating the incident, NBC 4 reported. 
There was no official mention of bleach or other disinfectant products being a poisoning agent. 
Despite this, the NYC's Patrolmen's Benevolent Association issued a statement warning officers to beware of food they have not prepared themselves and noting that 'a toxic substance, believed to be bleach' had been put in the officers' drinks. 
'When NYC police officers cannot even take meal without coming under attack, it is clear that environment in which we work has deteriorated to a critical level. We cannot afford to let our guard down for even a moment,' they said on Twitter.
The NYC Detective's Endowment Association also tweeted a warning to its members, saying that the officers were 'intentionally poisoned' by at least one Shake Shack worker. 
'Tonight, three of our fellow officers were intentionally poisoned by one or more workers at the Shake Shack at 200 Broadway in Manhattan. Fortunately, they were not seriously harmed,' the organization wrote. 
On Monday night, the official Shake Shack Twitter account wrote: 'We are horrified by the reports of police officers injured at our 200 Broadway Shack in Manhattan. We are working with the police in their investigation right now.'
Social media users questioned Shake Shack's use of the term 'injured,' noting that if bleach was actually the substance added to the police officers' shakes, it should have been called attempted murder. 
The alleged poisoning incident comes as anti-police sentiment has been rising in the US, following the high-profile deaths of African-Americans at police hands. 
In the wake of George Floyd's death in Minneapolis on May 25, who died in police custody after a cop kneeled on his neck, cities across the country have seen daily marches, some of which have involved violent clashes between protesters and police, demanding justice for victims including. 
On Sunday at about 9.30pm, Richmond Police Department officers in Virginia said they were attacked by protesters while in their official vehicles. Video showed protesters blocking the police vehicle's movement and throwing things at the car, as well as assaulting the officers through an open window, NBC 12 reported. 
Similar scenes have played out in other parts of the country over the last few weeks since Floyd's death. 
Three protesters, including two lawyers, in New York City now face life in prison after being indicted for throwing Molotov cocktails - acts caught on video - at police cars as protests turned into riots the weekend following Floyd's death. 
The backlash came after multiple videos of police abuses. 
Most recently, two Atlanta police officers made headlines after fatally shooting black man Rayshard Brooks twice in the back after police were called to remove him from the premises of a local Wendy's. 
When approached by police, Brooks, who was found intoxicated and asleep behind the wheel of his car at the Wendy's, grabbed one of the officer's Taser guns and had pointed it at the officer while running away, prior to being shot. 
In recent weeks, protesters have started calling for the defunding of police departments, and seeking to replace official police with community policing. 
The pressure has led police departments to begin changing their policing methods, including the banning of chokeholds during arrests. 
The NYPD on Monday announced it it will eliminate its plain-clothes, anti-crime unit, which had been involved in some of the city's most notorious shootings and reassign its 600 officers to detective work and neighborhood policing, among other areas. 
The decision comes as the NYPD has faced increasing scrutiny over tactics police have used against protesters, as well as people who have failed to observe social distancing orders during the coronavirus pandemic. "

The Democratic-led Legislature approved the long-stalled reform of the statute - which is routinely used to keep the public from learning about police misconduct and disciplinary actions taken against officers - in response to protests sparked by the death of George Floyd, a black Minnesota man who was killed when a white police officer kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes.
""The silver lining on this incredibly dark cloud is that the sun is finally starting to shine on injustice. Maybe it's the unmistakable, and in my opinion indisputable, video evidence that we saw a live murder on TV, but it's done something to the consciousness of America,"" said bill sponsor Sen. Jamaal Bailey (D-Bronx) in an emotional floor speech before the bill passed. ""I don't know if there could be a more meaningful piece of legislation for me and this body because it's way more than just policy.
""There's a time to not only correct what we thought and knew to be a flaw in the state law, but to correct misconceptions that many of us have carried for too long for things that we can never experience,"" he added.
The bill passed along party lines in the Senate, 40 to 22, with all Republicans voting against the measure. The Assembly approved the measure 101 to 43 Tuesday evening, also along party lines.
Since 1976, the statute has prevented the personnel and disciplinary records of any police officer, corrections officer or firefighter from being made public. The NYPD only started adhering to the statute in 2016, when the department abruptly stopped allowing media and the public to see the outcomes of administrative trials. The courts have repeatedly bolstered the more expansive interpretation of the law.
The law became a point of contention following the 2014 chokehold death of Eric Garner at the hands of then-NYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo, whose disciplinary record was shielded in secrecy.
Advocates, including New Yorkers United for Justice, and legal organizations such as the Legal Aid Society and the New York Civil Liberties Union, have pushed for the repeal of 50-a in the name of transparency.
""Our criminal justice system, in order to build and maintain public trust, must be transparent,"" said United for Justice chief strategist Khalil Cumberbatch. ""Even more so as it relates to law enforcement agencies - and that means accountability and public scrutiny for police.""
Former NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill conceded that ""the law must change"" after an independent panel, comprised of two former prosecutors and a former judge, released a report last year that found ""almost a complete lack of transparency and public accountability.""
""It is an attempt to level the playing field, it is an attempt to get information into the public,"" said sponsor Assemblyman Daniel O'Donnell (D-Manhattan), who has championed the bill for several years. ""We take one step forward today on transparency. We allow people some degree of peace.""
Police unions have vehemently argued against changing the law. A coalition of law enforcement groups said in a statement Monday that releasing records, including complaints, could leave officers facing ""unavoidable and irreparable harm to reputation and livelihood.""
However, the legislation provides officers with some privacy protections, redacting home addresses, phone numbers and email addresses.
""We, as professionals, are under assault,"" Patrick Lynch, the president of the Police Benevolent Association, representing rank-and-file NYPD officers, said during a press conference earlier Tuesday. ""And this in a backdrop of a night when we had seven shootings [in Brooklyn] in seven minutes.""
The bill makes police disciplinary records subject to Freedom of Information Law requests, similar to most records kept by public agencies. It is part of a package of police reform bills that the Legislature began voting on Monday.
The slate includes a bill making it a hate crime to call 911 and make a false claim based on a person's race, and another codifying into law the state attorney general's power to appoint a special prosecutor when someone is killed by police.
Other changes ban chokeholds under the so-called ""Eric Garner Act"" and mandate police departments to provide medical training to officers. Garner died after being put in a chokehold by cops on Staten Island in 2014.
Senate Republican leader John Flanagan (R-Nassau) railed against Democrats, accusing them of attempting to ""sow division"" under the guise of justice and civil rights.
""The brutal killing of George Floyd is a horrific tragedy that never should have occurred. There is simply no place in our society for police brutality, and whenever it does occur those responsible must be held accountable,"" he said. ""But it is not a reason to vilify and punish every man and woman in law enforcement who serves to protect and serve our communities in New York, nor should it be a reason to sow division.""
Gov. Cuomo has vowed to sign the legislation, calling Floyd's death the ""tipping point"" of a change that has been ""brewing for decades, if not centuries."""

“This is a nightmare,” Quawan “Bobby” Charles’ mother, Roxanne Nelson, told The Associated Press, adding that she’s heard conflicting accounts of what preceded her son’s disappearance. “I’ve had to go on a wild goose chase just to get information.”
A fundraising page, set up to raise $15,000 for Charles’ family, had brought in more than $160,000 by Thursday. It’s topped by post-death photographs’ of Charles’ face, with parts of his lips missing, and the face of 14-year-old Emmett Till, who was lynched in 1955. Charles’ family took the picture of his face, said civil rights attorney Ron Haley, one of three representing the family.
It “looks like a hate crime,” NAACP Louisiana Conference President Michael McClanahan said in a livestreamed interview for his weekly radio show Sunday on WTQT-FM in Baton Rouge. In an interview Thursday, he said he was hoping to get the Justice Department to investigate it as a hate crime.
However, Haley said he did not know whether damage to Charles’ face was caused by violence or by decay from days in Louisiana’s humid heat.
An independent autopsy by American Forensics of Mesquite, Texas, will answer that and other questions, he said. He said Charles’ body was sent there on Tuesday and he expects a report late this week or early next week.
Nelson said her family filed a missing persons report Oct. 30 in the St. Mary Parish town of Baldwin.
Her son's body was found the evening of Nov. 3 about 20 miles (32 kilometers) away in woods near the Iberia Parish town of Loreauville.
Nelson said Thursday that sheriff’s investigators told her this week that her son drowned, but they also were waiting for toxicology test results.
The coroner's office has told the family its preliminary results and will not release any information to the public until the final report is in — something that can take eight to 12 weeks, according to an email from that office.
The Iberia Parish Sheriff’s Office is investigating the death as a possible homicide because of “suspicious circumstances,” spokeswoman Katherine Breaux told The Associated Press on Thursday. No arrests have been made, and the Sheriff’s Office declined earlier to say whether investigators detected any signs of foul play.
Breaux said Sheriff Tommy Romero and case investigators met Monday with Nelson and Charles' father.
“This is an ongoing investigation and there's little information we can give out” to the public, Breaux said. “One thing we want the public to know and understand is that our investigators deal with facts, rather than rumors and social media speculations.”
Charles' family wants to put up a cross but has not been able to learn just where his body was found, André Arceneaux of Youngsville, an activist who was called in by the family, said Wednesday.
They also want to know why Baldwin police did not call for a statewide Amber Alert even though Nelson alleged that Charles might have been abducted, Haley said.
Louisiana State Police, who issue such alerts, were not asked to do so and are not part of the investigation into Charles' death, Lt. Nick Manale, a state police spokesman, said in an email Thursday.
Authorities in the two parishes have provided little information to the family, Haley and the ACLU said Wednesday.
“We join the family in demanding a full and transparent investigation into the circumstances surrounding Bobby’s death,"" Alanah Odoms Hebert, ACLU of Louisiana executive director, said in a news release Wednesday. “This family is grieving and deserves answers — not disrespect and stonewalling.”
The Baldwin Police Department declined to comment Wednesday. In a Facebook post on Tuesday, Assistant Chief Samuel Wise III said the department was not investigating the death but was looking into “reasons why the deceased juvenile was missing from his residence in Baldwin.”
Haley said, “I believe he was murdered and I believe somebody tried to cover it up. How, why, we don’t know. Folks have made the connection that it was a hate crime. I'm not ready to go there yet — there is much to be learned.”
“Something hateful was done to him. ... Motivation does not make it worse or not worse,” Haley said.

Their selective outrage is stunning.
On December 15, the Associated Press (AP) ran a big piece on the BLM banners. It claimed that black churches were vandalized. They were not. It was BLM banners displayed outside the churches that were burned: The churches themselves were not damaged in any way. By contrast, to cite one example, last spring BLM supporters spray-painted obscenities on the exterior wall of New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral. Yet there was no comparable outcry from those upset about BLM banners being burned.
To its credit, AP proved to be the most fair of any media outlet. It not only covered the BLM banners that were vandalized, it covered the several instances this year when statues of St. Junípero Serra were toppled by left-wing activists. Unfortunately, it was an anomaly among the big media. The New York Times and the Washington Post covered the BLM incident but had no news story on the multiple Serra incidents.
The burning of BLM banners was cited by CBS, CNN, Fox News, MSNBC and PBS. Only CBS mentioned the destruction of statues of St. Serra. Moreover, the attack on this heroic priest extended over several months in many cities; it was not just one weekend of violence.
It is not just the smashing of statues of St. Serra that Catholics have endured this year.
In June, the Catholic Basilica of St. Mary in Minneapolis was set on fire. Catholic churches near the University of Mississippi were vandalized. The Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate Conception in Denver was trashed.
Windows were smashed in Dallas at St. Jude Chapel and at the Cathedral of the Assumption in Louisville. Swastikas and anti-Catholic scribbling was found on the graves of several Dominican friars on the campus of Providence College.
In July, a statue of Our Blessed Mother was set on fire in Boston and another statue of the Virgin Mary was vandalized in Queens. In Ocala, Florida, a man crashed his minivan into a Catholic church while parishioners gathered for Mass; he then poured gasoline in the church's foyer and set the church ablaze. San Gabriel Mission Church in Los Angeles County was set on fire, destroying parts of the 249-year-old iconic structure. Vandals were charged with a hate crime after they partially disfigured Mission San Jose, a church in Fremont, California.
Also in July, Sacred Heart Catholic school in Gallup, New Mexico was broken into and a statue of Jesus was vandalized. A statue of Jesus was beheaded at Good Shepherd Catholic church in South Florida. ""Satanic"" and ""anarchist"" symbols were found on the church door at St. Joseph's Church in New Haven. In August, Bibles were burned in Portland.
In a sane world, we could all agree that vandalism of any kind is morally wrong. But we don't live in such a world.
Nikole Hannah-Jones, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist responsible for the New York Times' historically flawed ""1619 Project,"" says, ""Destroying property, which can be replaced, is not violence.""
David Remnick of the New Yorker is a big fan of BLM. He quotes, with relish, a co-founder of the racist organization. ""We don't have time to finger-wag at protesters about property. That can be rebuilt."" So could his house if someone torched it.
Two left-wing geniuses, Robin D.G. Kelley, an historian at UCLA, and R.H. Lossin, whose Ph.D. in Communications is from Columbia, both wrote lengthy defenses this past June about the violent Antifa and BLM mobs.
Kelley wrote in the New York Times that because ""we are in the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, looting should not surprise anyone."" But the looters stole toasters, not bread. They also helped themselves to pricey sneakers and jewelry, neither of which is edible. No matter, he chided the public for ""obsessing over looting.""
Lossin wrote her screed in the pages of the Nation, a Stalinist media outlet. ""Property destruction is not synonymous with the violence that is being protested,"" she opines. ""Plateglass windows don't bleed."" Neither does her laptop. But it's a sure bet she would object if a sledgehammer were taken to it. She is also no fan of non-violence. ""The notion that nonviolence is tactically more effective...has not only been proven wrong over the past week by sheer numbers; it cannot be historically supported.""
It would be hard to find a single professor of a conservative bent (thanks to the ""tolerant-minded"" professoriate, there aren't too many of them) who would belittle property crimes and denounce peaceful protests. Such sages are only found on the Left.
Forgive me if I can't get too exercised about BLM banners being set on fire. Antifa and BLM burn the American flag, churches, Catholic schools, and cop cars. The media and left-wing activists have no moral ground to stand on when they bash those of us who object to the latter while they go bonkers over the former.

 The 'Heroes of Today' platform, which aims to tackle intolerance and social discrimination, has used 'face replacement' technology, face replacement, to ""bring Mexican gay activist Julio Zúñiga back to life"" in his short film 'Intolerance is still there'.
 The short film, which was released on Monday, November 16, on the occasion of International Day for Tolerance, portrays the riots that took place at the Stonewall Inn pub in New York, United States, in June 1969.
 In this establishment began a series of demonstrations and protests against a police raid that are now remembered as the first occasion in American history when the LGTBI+ community fought a system that persecuted people for their sexual identity.
 'Intolerance is still there' also denounces the story of Zúñiga, a Mexican gay activist and LGTBI+ league footballer who was killed in 2017 in Mexico, the victim of a hate crime because of his sexual status.
 Thanks to the technology of 'face replacement' and 3D, the 'Heroes of Today' platform has managed to ""bring Zúñiga back to life"" in his short film, even though he was never in the riots of Stonewall Inn or in the filming of 'Intolerance is still there', as they explain from the platform in a statement.
 To make Zúñiga appear in the short film, the platform first extracted facial data from the activist through videos and photographs - some home- in which he appeared with Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools to achieve a digital model that could be used to replace double.
 On the other hand, the face of the actor who plays Zúñiga was also captured, from different angles and with different expressions, so that he could later overlay the digital face of the Mexican activist.
 In plans where 'face replacement' technology did not achieve a replacement with sufficient quality, the platform resorted to a 3D face model. To perfect the integration, there was also a lighting work, from captures during the filming of all the light surrounding the actor.
 In total, it took about three months for the platform to integrate Zúñiga into the short film."

“This is a nightmare,” Quawan “Bobby” Charles’ mother, Roxanne Nelson, told The Associated Press, adding that she’s heard conflicting accounts of what preceded her son’s disappearance. “I’ve had to go on a wild goose chase just to get information.”
A fundraising page, set up to raise $15,000 for Charles’ family, had brought in more than $160,000 by Thursday. It’s topped by post-death photographs’ of Charles’ face, with parts of his lips missing, and the face of 14-year-old Emmett Till, who was lynched in 1955. Charles’ family took the picture of his face, said civil rights attorney Ron Haley, one of three representing the family.
It “looks like a hate crime,” NAACP Louisiana Conference President Michael McClanahan said in a livestreamed interview for his weekly radio show Sunday on WTQT-FM in Baton Rouge. In an interview Thursday, he said he was hoping to get the Justice Department to investigate it as a hate crime.
However, Haley said he did not know whether damage to Charles’ face was caused by violence or by decay from days in Louisiana’s humid heat.
An independent autopsy by American Forensics of Mesquite, Texas, will answer that and other questions, he said. He said Charles’ body was sent there on Tuesday and he expects a report late this week or early next week.
Nelson said her family filed a missing persons report Oct. 30 in the St. Mary Parish town of Baldwin.
Her son's body was found the evening of Nov. 3 about 20 miles (32 kilometers) away in woods near the Iberia Parish town of Loreauville.
Nelson said Thursday that sheriff’s investigators told her this week that her son drowned, but they also were waiting for toxicology test results.
The coroner's office has told the family its preliminary results and will not release any information to the public until the final report is in — something that can take eight to 12 weeks, according to an email from that office.
The Iberia Parish Sheriff’s Office is investigating the death as a possible homicide because of “suspicious circumstances,” spokeswoman Katherine Breaux told The Associated Press on Thursday. No arrests have been made, and the Sheriff’s Office declined earlier to say whether investigators detected any signs of foul play.
Breaux said Sheriff Tommy Romero and case investigators met Monday with Nelson and Charles' father.
“This is an ongoing investigation and there's little information we can give out” to the public, Breaux said. “One thing we want the public to know and understand is that our investigators deal with facts, rather than rumors and social media speculations.”
Charles' family wants to put up a cross but has not been able to learn just where his body was found, André Arceneaux of Youngsville, an activist who was called in by the family, said Wednesday.

The ""CAREN Act"" (Caution Against Racially Exploitative Non-Emergencies) was introduced on Tuesday at a San Francisco Board of Supervisors meeting by Supervisor Shamann Walton.
The ordinance's name is a twist on ""Karen,"" the name social media gives people making racially biased 911 calls.
And it's not just ""Karen."" There are also names like ""Becky,"" which has also come to symbolize a stereotype of whiteness. And ""Susan."" And ""Chad.""
The ordinance is similar to the statewide AB 1550 bill introduced by California Assemblyman Rob Bonta, making it unlawful and accountable for a caller to ""fabricate false racially biased emergency reports."".
""Using 911 as a tool for your prejudice towards marginalized communities is unjust and wrong!"" Bonta tweeted.
Racially motivated 911 calls aren't a new occurrence across the country, in spite of a recent uptick following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man killed in police custody in Minneapolis.
Just a few weeks ago, a White hotel employee in North Carolina called the police on a guest, a Black woman and her children, who were using the hotel's swimming pool. And in May, a White woman called 911 on a Black man who was birdwatching in New York's Central Park.
Bonta said the intent of AB 1550 isn't to discourage Californians in real danger from calling 911.
""This bill could protect millions of Californians from becoming targets of hate and prevent the weaponization of our law enforcement against communities of color,"" he said in an online release.
""Racist false reports put people in danger and waste resources,"" the ordinance's co-author, Supervisor Matt Haney, tweeted.
Though making a false police report is a misdemeanor or felony offense in many states, including California, accountability is lacking for making racially biased calls to law enforcement.
Other cities have already begun the process to pass similar legislation.
Los Angeles City Councilman Curren Price introduced a similar motion to the City Council in June exploring ""criminal penalties, rights of victims to bring private civil actions and cost recovery by the City,"" he tweeted.
In 2019, the City Commission in Grand Rapids, Michigan, held a public hearing on a ""proposed human rights ordinance"" criminalizing racially motivated calls to 911 with a fine of up to $500.
In 2018, former New York state Sen. Jesse Hamilton proposed a bill after a woman called 911 on him for campaigning, that would require the local district attorney to investigate these incidents as hate crimes. If the calls were deemed racially motivated, a number of consequences such as fines, sensitivity training or jail time would be issued."

Anti-Semitic incidents have been in the rise in the U.S. since 2013. The Anti-Defamation League's most recent Audit of Antisemitic Incidents found 2,107 anti-Semitic incidents[2] were recorded in 2019, up 12% from 2018, with assaults up 56%, most taking place in New York City.The FBI reported[3] 7,120 hate crimes across the U.S. in 2018, 18.6% motivated by religious bias.Trump has called American Jews who vote for Democrats disloyal and asked Jewish leaders to explain why he has not wrapped up the Jewish vote since his son-in-law and daughter are Jewish.The also contains images of the deadly 2017 Charlottesville, Virginia, white supremacist rally where an attendee rammed his car into a group of counter-protesters, killing one, and memorials outside the Tree of Life temple in Pittsburgh where 11 people were shot to death in 2018 by a self-described white supremacist.'History shows us what happens when leaders use hatred and nationalism to divide their people,' the narrator says. 
Trump's rhetoric often is seen is divisive. [embedded content][4]The ad says anti-Semitism and white nationalism have reached dangerous levels.'Hate doesn't stop itself. It must be stopped. Vote — our future depends on it,' the narrator says. The ad targets Jewish voters in Florida, Michigan and Pennsylvania - three states President Donald Trump won in 2016.The ad says that not only do American Jews feel less safe today, Trump's assault on democratic institutions 'are reminiscent of the rise of fascism in 1930s Germany.'Trump, who said there were 'very fine people' on both sides of the Charlottesville protest, signed an executive order last December addressing anti-Semitism and supporters point to the actions he has taken in favor of Israel.But a Washington Post report[5] last week indicated Trump made anti-Semitic remarks after talking with Jewish lawmakers and made derogatory remarks about other racial and ethnic groups in private conversations.Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has called the rise in anti-Semitism 'horrifying.'

Daniel Finkelstein in The Timeson balancing the economy with healthBoris Johnson has undercooked his Covid plan[3] See related Why everybody's talking about the threat of a second national lockdown[4] 'At the root of the Covid-19 problem is a simple choice: the crisis won't pass until we either have a successful treatment or vaccine, or natural herd immunity so that if someone gets it they can't really pass it on because such a large proportion of the population are immune. We must choose. We can allow the virus to spread, aiming to achieve herd immunity as quickly as possible. Or we can try to hold it off until we get a vaccine or treatment. 
The choice may be simple but that doesn't make it an easy one. We can't know for certain when an adequate treatment or a vaccine will be available. If we hang on for science to rescue us, holding back the economy and social life, we can't be sure the cavalry will ever arrive. And at some point we will have to give up and allow natural herd immunity to develop after all, with all the deaths that involves, meaning that much of the effort and sacrifice we made was in vain. Nevertheless, I believe this risk — putting much of our economic and social lives on hold — is still the right one to take.'2. Julian Baggini in The Guardianon an old conservative trick'Freedom-loving Brits'? It's not that simple, Prime Minister[5]'When freedom simply means the absence of the state, there are always trade-offs between liberty and security, individual freedom and public health. But when we also think of the freedom to eat, to work, to have an education, to determine your own future, the only trade-offs are between different kinds of freedom, or the freedoms of different groups of people. Make people freer to mingle and you decrease the real freedom of the old and vulnerable to live their lives in safety. Give businesses the right to demand their employees go back to their workplaces and you increase their freedom to trade but not the freedom of employees to protect themselves and their families. Withdraw state support for the furlough scheme and you may cut people free from the ties of government but leave them penniless and powerless.'3.Jonathan Portes, professor of economics and public policy at King's College, London in The Independenton an oncoming crisisA no-deal Brexit would be twice as damaging for the UK economy as coronavirus in the long term[6]'Will Covid-19 mean that we don't notice a no-deal Brexit? The continuing effects of the pandemic may mitigate or obscure - politically or economically - the impact of no deal. Whatever the headline growth figures in early 2021, it will be very difficult to attribute economic outcomes to Brexit. However, assuming a reasonably strong recovery, and that government policies succeed in avoiding persistent mass unemployment, Brexit is likely to have a more significant impact in the long run. Our modelling with the London School of Economics of the impact of a no-deal Brexit suggests that the total cost to the UK economy over the longer term will be two to three times as large as that implied by the Bank of England's forecast for the impact of Covid-19. No deal will result in immediate and substantial tariff and non-tariff barriers on UK exports to the EU. And the UK will apply the new UK Global Tariff to imports from the EU and other countries with which it does not have a trade deal. Free movement will also come to an end.'4. Stella Creasy, Labour MP forWalthamstow, in The Daily Telegraphon tackling crime against womenMaking misogyny a hate crime has nothing to do with wolf-whistling[7]'Recognising misogyny as a driver of crime doesn't create any new crimes or criminalise anything that isn't already an offence - but it does change the seriousness with which it is treated and so addressed. As the Met Police says of other forms of hate crime: 'If it happens to you, you might be tempted to shrug it off. But if you report the hate crime, we can investigate and stop it from getting worse - either for you or someone else.' With reports during lockdown of sexual harassment and domestic violence soaring there has never been a more important time to change our approach to the abuse women face. This isn't just about a change in the criminal justice system. As with other forms of hate crime, it sends a message about the kind of society we want to live in and how to ensure everyone is free to be who they are. Overlooking the harm done by hostility based on sex creates a culture in which crimes involving violence and the abuse of women can flourish. Misogyny is so ingrained that we discount, rather than counter, it - telling women how to keep themselves safe rather than those responsible that they will be held accountable.'5.Frank Bruni in The New York Timeson appointingpoliticisedjudgesThe Special Hell of Trump's Supreme Court Appointment[8]'It was almost inevitable that President Trump would get one Supreme Court appointment during this four-year term. It was always possible that he'd get two. But three? Seldom has a president's impact been so inversely proportional to his warrant. Trump, with his nonexistent mandate, reaches extra far and wreaks extra damage. That's what makes his reign so perverse. That's the special hell of it. Almost instantly after the news of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death, I checked how many Supreme Court justices Trump's immediate predecessors had appointed, because I knew how fast he and Mitch McConnell would move to fill her seat. When it comes to this sort of unabashed power grab, they're conjoined twins, connected by their contempt for fools who get hung up on hypocrisy and prattle about fairness.'

Rights activists have fought and died for the LBTQ2+ community.
One morning at the end of June 1969, about 200 people were inside the Stonewall Inn when the New York Police Department decided to pay a visit.
They raided the Inn and people were arrested and threatened due to their sexual orientation.
It was on this day the LGBTQ2+ community decided enough was enough and fought back. Fires, riots, and protesters littered the streets for the next five days. These heroic people were the beginning of change and marked June as Pride Month.
Many people have lost hope for Pride Month this June due to the pandemic, but now it is more important than ever to show support. Many people in the LGBTQ2+ community are feeling isolated due to quarantine. Not everyone is fortunate enough to be able to express themselves or be supported at home.
Although Pride month will not look the same as usual it is still necessary to show our love and support.
It is vital to send a message to those around the world who are closeted, feeling isolated, or need validation that they are loved.
I challenge the Vernon community to show their support this Pride Month, whether it's through window displays, clothing or online presence.
In 2018, executive director of Vancouver Pride Society, Andrea Arnot commented on the fact that hate crimes based on sexual orientation had gone up since 2017.
She said, ""The fact that the number of hate crimes overall has shown a decrease and yet there was a rise in hate crimes against our community, indicates that we still have a lot of work to do around education and advocacy.""
Being an ally, regardless of your personal orientation, is a great way to protect people's rights and raise awareness. After all LGBTQ2+ rights are human rights and we should refuse to let the years of fighting against oppression go to waste.

Mr. Guterres noted that the pandemic has been accompanied by “a surge in stigma and racist discourse vilifying communities, spreading vile stereotypes and assigning blame.”
The UN Chief listed some of the disturbing examples of discrimination against religious minorities, such as attacks on people and religious sites, and hate crimes and atrocity crimes targeting populations because of their religion or belief.
In order to counter this discrimination, Mr. Guterres called for more action to address the root causes of intolerance and discrimination by promoting inclusion and respect for diversity, as well as for the perpetrators of crimes of this nature to be held accountable.
Freedom of religion is a human right
“The right to freedom of religion or belief is firmly entrenched in international human rights law”, said the Secretary-General, “and is a cornerstone for inclusive, prosperous and peaceful societies.”
States, he added, have the primary responsibility to protect the right to freedom of religion and belief. Initiatives set up by Mr. Guterres to support them include his Call to Action for Human Rights, a Strategy on Hate Speech and a Plan of Action to Safeguard Religious Sites.
The International Day was created by a UN Resolution adopted in May 2019, in response to a rise of intolerance and violence based on religion or belief against individuals, which are often of a criminal nature. Launching his Strategy on Hate Speech in June 2019, Mr. Guterres said that “a groundswell of xenophobia, racism and intolerance, violent misogyny, anti-Semitism and anti-Muslim hatred” are being seen around the world, and noted that, in some places, Christian communities were also being systematically attacked.
The Strategy aims to enable the UN to respond to “the impact of hate speech on societies”, Mr. Guterres explained, by bringing individuals and groups together who have opposing views; working with traditional and social media platforms; and developing communications guidance."

'sign' of progressCuomo inks police reform bill making disciplinary files more accessible",FALSE,"Here comes the sunshine.
Gov. Cuomo signed legislation on Friday that will prevent the NYPD and other police departments in the state from keeping the public in the dark when it comes to disciplinary records.
The measure - passed by the Legislature this week as part of a package of law-enforcement reforms following the death of George Floyd - repeals 50-a, a section of New York law dating back to 1976 that allowed police, fire and corrections departments to keep disciplinary and personnel records under wraps.
""There's no trust and if there is no trust, the relationship doesn't work,"" the governor said as he signed the bill at his Manhattan office. ""If there's no trust, the police can't effectively police. If there's no trust, the community is not going to allow the police to police.
""There is no trust or there is a breach of the trust and that has to be restored,"" he added.
State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins (D-Yonkers), Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie (D-Bronx) and civil rights activist Rev. Al Sharpton joined Cuomo as he signed the repeal along with three other bills.
The new law, effective immediately, makes disciplinary records subject to Freedom of Information Law requests from journalists and the public, shining a light on the well-guarded files after decades of secrecy.
""The truth is this: Police reform is long overdue, and Mr. Floyd's murder is just the most recent murder,"" Cuomo said. ""It's about being here before - many, many times before.""
In the next breath, the governor announced an executive order that requires the roughly 500 police departments across the Empire State to develop a plan by April 1, 2021 to address systemic racism in their ranks. If a department doesn't follow through, Cuomo said he will strip it of state funding.
""We're not going to be as a state government subsidizing improper police tactics. We're not doing it,"" Cuomo said. ""And this is how we're going to do it.""
Stewart-Cousins, who played a large role in shepherding the 50-a repeal through the Senate, echoed the governor's sentiment and stressed that the battle for justice isn't over.
""We know this isn't a cure,"" she said. ""We know that this is the beginning, but it's a move to bring justice to a system that has long been unjust.""
Sharpton, who's led the push for police reform for decades, was widely praised by Cuomo for ""standing up"" and ""making sure the people of this nation heard every time every injustice happened.""
Sharpton returned the favor and gave Cuomo a particularly hearty pat on the back for his executive order threatening to defund police departments.
""He has raised the bar,"" Sharpton said.
Advocates and legal defense groups also applauded the move.
""Finally, after years of advocacy, New York has struck down one of the nation's most secretive laws, a law that shielded police misconduct from public scrutiny,"" said Tina Luongo, attorney-in-charge of the Criminal Defense Practice at the Legal Aid Society. ""Sadly, we will never know the full breadth and depth of the injustices created under the previous system that deprived New Yorkers access to this fundamental information.""
In addition to amending 50-a, Cuomo signed three other long-sought police reform bills approved by the Legislature amid widespread civil unrest over Floyd's caught-on-camera death at the hands of a white Minneapolis cop.
One measure grants the state attorney general's office the ability to investigate and potentially prosecute incidents when a person dies in custody or after an encounter with a police officer. Another makes it a hate crime to call 911 to report false claims based on a person's race.
Also included in the batch is the ""Eric Garner Act,"" which bans officers from using chokeholds and allows prosecutors to charge cops if they do and injure or kill someone. Garner died after being put in a chokehold by NYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo on Staten Island in 2014. His death - and a final cry of ""I can't breathe"" - helped spark the Black Lives Matter movement.
Pantaleo, who wasn't fired until August 2019, was able to keep his disciplinary records from public view thanks to 50-a, making the law a point of contention in the aftermath of Garner's death.
Gwen Carr, Eric Garner's mother, attended the Friday signing. As Cuomo put ink on the bill, Carr mused: ""It was a long time coming, but it came.""
Police unions and Republicans say the repeal of 50-a could expose sensitive information about officers and prevent them from doing their jobs.
However, just like other city and state records subject to Freedom of Information Law requests, personal details, such as phone numbers and home addresses, cannot be divulged to the public.
Pat Lynch, the president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, representing rank-and-file NYPD officers, slammed Cuomo over the bill and his threat to pull state funds from cops.
""Governor Cuomo and our legislative leaders have no business celebrating today,"" he said. ""New York state had been failing our communities for decades: failing to provide economic opportunity, failing to educate our youth, failing to care for the vulnerable and the mentally ill.
""Police officers spend our days addressing issues caused by these failures. Now, we won't even be able to do that,"" he added.
In addition to the four bills signed by the governor on Friday, the Democrat-led Legislature passed six other law-enforcement reform-oriented measures this week.
The remaining bills, which Cuomo is also expected to sign, implement a ban on race-based profiling, mandate state police to wear body cameras and require police departments to provide medical training to officers, among other provisions."

The Democratic nominee wants to ban assault weapons, enforce more stringent background checks, and end the sale of firearms and ammunitions online. 
 Follow our US election 2020 live blog for the latest news & updates 
Here's more on his blueprint to tackling America's gun problem.
 What is Biden's gun control plan? 
 Joe Biden's plan to end gun violence in the US would make sweeping changes to federal gun laws, which include universal background checks and an assault weapons ban.
It would also close several loopholes in existing legislation, repeal a law that makes it harder to sue gunmakers and retailers when they manufacture or sell guns they should have known would have been used criminally.
Biden's proposal seeks to:
Ban the importation, manufacture, and sale of high-capacity magazines. The ban would be designed to prevent gunmakers from flouting the law by making minor changes that don't limit the weapon's lethality.
Reduce stockpiling of weapons. The Democrat supports legislation limiting the number of guns an individual is legally allowed to by per month to just one.
Require background checks for all gun sales. Biden would enact a universal background check law with few exceptions like gifts between close family members. This would close the so-called ""gun show and online sales loophole"" Biden and President Barack Obama narrowed during their administration.
End online sales of firearms and ammunition. The former vice president plans to enact a law that would ban all online sales of guns, ammo, kits, and gun parts.
Close the ""hate crime"" loophole. Biden would prohibit anyone ""who has been convicted of a misdemeanor hate crime, or received an enhanced sentence for a misdemeanor because of hate or bias in its commission"" from buying or owning a gun.
 What is Joe Biden's stance on gun control? 
Although Biden is a gun owner himself, he's long supported a stricter interpretation of the Second Amendment.
In 1933, he voted with Democrats to place a 10-year ban on semi-automatic weapons and voted in favor of the Brady handgun bill that same year.
The Brady bill requires a five-day waiting period for gun purchases so that sellers can run a background check.
Biden criticized America's ""problem with guns"" in an August 2019 op-ed published in the New York Times.
""We have a huge problem with guns, assault weapons - military-style firearms designed to fire rapidly - are a threat to our national security, and we should treat them as such,"" he wrote.
""Anyone who pretends there's nothing we can do is lying - and holding that view should be disqualifying for anyone seeking to lead our country.""
During a primary debate last June, Biden claimed ""our enemy is the gun manufacturers, not the NRA - the gun manufacturers."""

By John McClaughry
The news media was overflowing last month with the story that some unknown racist had left a noose hanging in the Talladega track garage assigned to NASCAR’s only black driver, Bubba Wallace.
Wallace himself didn’t raise the issue, but when it hit the front pages he lamented – not surprisingly – that such people were still on the loose inflaming racial animosities, but he wasn’t going to let it stop his career. Wallace’s fellow NASCAR drivers engaged in an on-track procession of support for Bubba. That would have been a commendable show of support for a black man threatened by sinister racists.
But meanwhile, fifteen federal agents – fifteen – descended on Talladega and with the aid of track technicians discovered in only two intense days of investigating that far from being a hate crime, the menacing noose was merely a pull rope used to pull down the overhead door, and it had been there at least since last October, long before that garage was assigned to black driver Wallace.
In short, there was nothing to this wild story, but the national news media and politicians grabbed it to illustrate their narrative that America is under assault by racism, and no desperate measure to combat it, like banishing Teddy Roosevelt’s statue from the New York Public Library, is beyond the pale.
Yes, there is unfortunately a lot of racism still in evidence, but sensationalizing false accounts doesn’t help to stamp it out.

It’s Thursday. 
Weather: A beautiful day: Sunny and dry, with a high around 80. 
Alternate-side parking: In effect until Sept. 7 (Labor Day). Read about the amended regulations here. 
When it comes to the coronavirus, the ZIP code you live in may have made all the difference.
New York City released the results of about 1.5 million antibody tests this week, and they confirmed how deeply the virus affected lower-income communities. Results from wealthier neighborhoods tell a different story: No ZIP code below 96th Street in Manhattan had positive antibody results above 20 percent.
In a recent article, my colleague Joseph Goldstein wrote that these results provided insight on which neighborhoods were hit hardest, and whether some communities might have achieved herd immunity.
Here are five takeaways from that article:
The new data is on a larger scale than earlier test results.
Previous antibody data has been relatively limited. An April survey by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s office, which involved testing 28,419 people across the state, suggested that about 21 percent of New York City residents had antibodies to the coronavirus.
The new antibody data from the city included more than 15 percent of city residents, and showed that more than 27 percent of those tested were positive.
“This gives us a sense at a deeper level of the magnitude of the penetration of the infection into the population,” Wafaa El-Sadr, an epidemiology professor at Columbia University, told Mr. Goldstein.
Hard-hit areas may be better protected in a second wave.
The city has reached its lowest percentage of positive virus tests, 0.24 percent, since the pandemic began, Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Wednesday. But Mr. Cuomo that same day said the figure was 0.8 percent.
Despite the discrepancy, both numbers indicate that the city has largely tamed the virus. Still, health experts are warning of a second wave, and much is unknown about the protection that coronavirus antibodies provide.
But there may be some good news for neighborhoods like Corona, Queens, that were ravaged by the virus in March and April: Some researchers are hopefulthat herd immunity would require about half of the community to be immune.
In one ZIP code in Corona, 51.6 percent of people tested had antibodies.
Large households were especially vulnerable.
The hardest-hit ZIP code in the city indeed belonged to Corona, which is home to many construction and restaurant workers who continued with their jobs through the height of the virus crisis. The neighborhood also has an especially high rate of household crowding, which may have contributed to greater rates of infection.
The tight-knit Hasidic Jewish community in Borough Park, Brooklyn, was also severely affected. The neighborhood, where larger households are also common, recorded the city’s second-highest rate of positive antibody tests.
Children were more likely to have antibodies.
More than 32 percent of children who were tested were positive, making those 17 and under the most likely age group to have antibodies.
However, children were the least likely age group to be tested for antibodies, so this data doesn’t add much insight on whether the city’s public schools should reopen.
The data isn’t perfect.
Even though the scope of the city’s new data is broad, it has limitations. The New Yorkers who were included sought out testing themselves, so the participants were not from a random sample.
It also appeared that residents of neighborhoods with low infection rates, like some parts of Manhattan, sought out antibody testing more.

And finally: Cabs and the coronavirus
New York Today readers were recently invited to ask our reporters questions about the effects of the pandemic on city life. Katherine McGuinness, who lives in TriBeCa, wanted to learn about the impact on the already-struggling taxicab industry.
“I’ve lived in New York City for four years, and I miss the vibrancy and sounds of the city — a lot of which cabs supply,” she said. “I realized that I didn’t know how they were doing. Hailing a cab is an experience most New Yorkers can relate to, and one that always thrills me. As people remain out of their offices and close to home, it’s difficult to imagine getting in a cab for the foreseeable future.”
Brian Rosenthal, who last year published an exposé of predatory lending in the taxi medallion industry, weighed in:
“The coronavirus pandemic has devastated the New York City taxi industry,” he said. “Many drivers are in high-risk groups; dozens have died, and many have been unable to work.”
He continued: “Before the pandemic, about 11,500 yellow cabs operated on the city’s streets. A recent study by the city found that amid a collapse in business, that number dropped to about 2,200 in April, and it only climbed to about 3,000 by late June. Over all, ridership and revenues have fallen by nearly 90 percent.
“This all came at a time when the industry was already in crisis, especially for drivers who own medallions, the city permits that let them own their own cab. Many immigrant drivers were pushed into signing large loans to buy medallions that they could not afford. Before the pandemic, government officials had been discussing a bailout for medallion owners trapped in predatory loans, but that was put on hold when the virus began spreading.
“The only sliver of good news has been that lenders have not been forcing drivers to make loan payments during the pandemic, providing a bit of a reprieve as the industry hopes that it will be able to recover.”
It’s Thursday — be curious.
Metropolitan Diary: Late apology
Dear Diary:
To the woman I fell onto on the 3 train that morning: I’m sorry, and I feel awful for the way things turned out.
You see, when I got on the train, I was in that awkward position of not being near a pole I could hold on to. The only thing I could do was press my palm to the subway ceiling and pray that I wouldn’t lose my footing.
In the end, as you know, I did lose it. I could tell by the look you gave me as you shook your head that you were very upset.
I didn’t say I was sorry at the time because I was in a particularly bad mood. I was tired, and I hadn’t gotten much sleep the night before. You had a right to be annoyed with me. Nobody wants a tall 16-year-old with a heavy backpack to tumble onto them on their way to work.
If you cannot accept my apology, I completely understand. If I had the opportunity to take that ride again, I would hold onto the ceiling with a tighter grip, and, if I lost my balance again, apologize in person.
I wish you a lifetime of peaceful commutes on the No. 3. I hope something like that never happens to you again.
Sincerely, the tall boy who fell onto you that morning.

The New York Times has credited[3] Soros with pioneering the 'push to overhaul prosecutors' offices' across the country.Cook County, Illinois, State's Attorney Kimberly Foxx, whose jurisdiction includes Chicago, took office in 2017 after winning her election with the help of a Soros-funded super PAC.Soros poured more than $400,000 into Illinois Justice &#38; Public Safety PAC in 2016, Illinois State Board of Elections records[4] show. Foxx was the only candidate that the PAC supported in 2016, those records show.Foxx announced in December 2016, shortly before taking office, that her office wouldn't charge shoplifters with felonies unless they either had more than 10 previous felony convictions or if they stole more than $1,000 worth of goods, which was more than triple the previous felony threshold of $300.Storeowners blamed Foxx's policy in December 2019 for what they said was a string of brazen thefts targeting their businesses.Foxx announced in June that she wouldn't prosecute protesters charged with minor crimes, such as curfew violations and disorderly conduct, in the unrest following the death of George Floyd. 
Floyd, a black man, died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes, video shows.A report[5] in June from the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund, a pro-police nonprofit, found 'a 13% decrease in felony guilty outcomes, with a 27% decline in guilty verdicts and a 54% increase in dropped and dismissed cases' since Foxx took office in 2017.A separate study by the Marshall Project, a nonprofit supporting criminal justice reform, also found that Foxx has dropped thousands of cases that would have been prosecuted by her predecessor.'We found that since she took office she turned away more than 5,000 cases that would have been pursued by previous State's Attorney Anita Alvarez, mostly by declining to prosecute low-level shoplifting and drug offenses and by diverting more cases to alternative treatment programs,' the October 2019 report[6] said.Foxx faced criticism[7] for her handling of the case against actor Jussie Smollett, who was accused in February 2019 of staging a hate crime[8] against himself. In April 2019, the Chicago police union declared[9] 'no confidence' in Foxx.A special prosecutor appointed by a Cook County judge to reinvestigate the case announced this past February that a grand jury had indicted[10] Smollett on six counts related to the alleged hate crime hoax....There is much more.Police in Chicago believe that the recently organized looting of downtown stores is a result of this no prosecution policy. The story chronicles the crime disasters in cities with Soros'backed prosecutors including Dallas, Texas which has seen its murder rate soar. Voters need to turn these people out of office as soon as possible for their own safety. Rewarding crime by not punishing it only leads to more crime.

At a service at the Congregation B'nai Jacob synagogue in Jersey City, clergy and civic leaders spoke about the victims and the shocking explosion of violence. There they lit candles for two occasions - the first night of Chanukah and the first anniversary of the bloodbath.
""The shooting at the kosher market last year was a trauma for the community,"" said Michael Zwain, president of the congregation. ""The memorial is important so we can come together to honor the lives of the four people who died so tragically that day.""
The synagogue's rabbi, Bronwen Mullin, spoke of heroes and miracles, and the sacrifices that Seals and store clerk Douglas Miguel Rodriguez, 49, made to save lives.
""A hero is someone who fights for what they believe in even if the odds are against them,"" she said. ""Douglas Miguel Rodriguez is a hero to his family. He is also a hero to the Hasidic community. Even while his life was at risk he used his strength to open a back door so one person could escape.""
Seals, she said, ""is remembered as the guy who shows up for everybody, who took great pride in getting the job done. That is a hero.""
Also killed were Mindy Ferencz, 31, the kosher store's co-owner and mother of three, and Brooklyn rabbinical student Moshe Deutsch, 24.
Rodriguez's widow, Martha Friere, skipped the synagogue memorial. She said the wounds from that tragedy are still too fresh.
""People say as time passes it gets easier. But for us, the more time passes, the more we miss him,"" Friere said. ""We are alone now. And now with the pandemic, it's been even harder.""
She said the isolation has been the most difficult part, although she said members of the Jewish community helped the family with the gift of a laptop to help navigate some immigration issues. Pro bono lawyers and a GoFundMe page have also eased the burden, Friere said.
But she said she has been disappointed that there hasn't been more outreach.
""Honestly, I'm not complaining,"" Friere said. ""I know the year has been hard with the pandemic, so I've survived with God's blessing. But, look, if in a year no one has remembered you or even come to knock on your door to ask how I'm doing, how my daughter is doing, are we surviving the pandemic? And now that it marks one year and they want to reach out, no - I can't be around people that have forgotten us.""
""I want people to remember to love their neighbor and remember how Miguel loved his neighbor,"" Friere said. ""He helped because he cared for those around him.
The supermarket where Rodriguez and his bosses died was adjacent to a yeshiva with 50 students, and Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said afterward that he believed the killers intended to target the kids inside. ""We shouldn't parse words on whether this is a hate crime at this point,"" Fulop said at the time. ""This was a hate crime against Jewish [people].""
Seals, a 39-year-old father of five, was shot to death in a city cemetery after approaching one of the suspects in connection with an earlier homicide.
The shooters, later described as terrorists by Mayor de Blasio, then climbed into a stolen U-Haul truck and drove to the Jewish-owned grocery.
A chilling 45-second video clip showed David Anderson and Francine Graham, armed with high-powered rifles, opening fire as they ran toward the store. Pedestrians scattered on the sidewalk, and one customer incredibly slipped past the shooters through the front door."

Wallace, who was in the national spotlight in June after NASCAR said a noose was found hanging in his garage stall at Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama, will finish the final nine races of the season in the No 43 Chevrolet. ""This was not an easy decision as I have nothing but the utmost respect for Richard Petty and his family, but I believe it's time for someone else to take over the reins of the No 43,"" Wallace said in a statement on Twitter.

Wallace was thrust into the spotlight this year when his calls for NASCAR to ban the Confederate flag - which many Americans see as a symbol of oppression - at all events was ultimately adopted. The driver was later thought to have been a victim of a racial attack when a noose, a symbol connected to lynching and America's slave history, was found in his garage. The incident rocked NASCAR and took on added significance at a time of heightened tension over racism in the United States following nationwide protests over the death of African American George Floyd in police custody. The noose, according to NASCAR, was actually a garage door pull rope fashioned like a noose. The US Justice Department said after an investigation that the noose may have been in the garage since last October and that Wallace was not the target of a hate crime. - Reuters"

In early June, as the nation faced widespread protests over the killing of George Floyd, a Charlotte resident said she found two nooses hanging in a local Home Depot. She told a local news station she was shocked to find the knots displayed openly on store shelves.
Home Depot released a statement saying it was ""appalled and disturbed by the incident.""
But it wasn't the first time Home Depot was alerted to nooses in its stores. As a result, the company has decided to sell shorter, pre-cut lengths of rope instead of rope wrapped on large spools.
""Unfortunately, we've had some instances where spooled rope was used to create hate symbols and we're not going to tolerate it,"" Home Depot spokesperson Margaret Smith told CNN Business on Thursday.
The hangman's noose knot is widely regarded as a threatening symbol of racism and hatred. In American history, noose knots were commonly used to hang African Americans during routine lynchings that have terrorized Black communities since slavery.
Home Depot said the rope sale policy change was a precautionary measure.
In 2016, a Pittsburgh-area Home Depot employee filed a complaint after discovering a noose hanging in the rope aisle inside his store. And last year, a Wilmington, Delaware, Home Depot came under fire after sisters Lisa and Lyonni Flowers reported finding nooses hanging in the store's rope aisle.
The symbolism of nooses is particularly relevant as businesses and institutions across the country are engaged in a conversation about systemic racism.
NASCAR officials recently released a photo of a noose found hanging in the garage stall of NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace, who is Black. NASCAR personnel found the knot at the Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama on June 21, officials said.
An FBI investigation determined the incident was not a hate crime after investigators discovered the noose had been hanging in the stall since October of last year. 
""It was a noose,"" Wallace said in response to the FBI investigation. ""Whether tied in 2019 or whatever, it was a noose.""

Senators James Lankford (R-OK), co-chair of the Senate Bipartisan Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism and member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, sent a letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee today requesting that the Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP) be adequately funded to meet the needs of at-risk organizations this fiscal year.
The funding allocated by this program will support nonprofit organizations most at risk of terror attacks through the acquisition and installation of physical target hardening measures, related preparedness and prevention planning, training, and exercises, and contracted security personnel so faith- and community-based organizations have the critical resources and tools they need to protect lives and property. According to a recent FBI report on hate crime statistics in 2019, 60.2 percent were victims of crimes motivated by offenders' anti-Jewish bias.
Joining Lankford in sending the letter are Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Rob Portman (R-OH), Gary Peters (D-MI), and Jacky Rosen (D-NV).
""This grant program is vital to ensure faith- and community-based nonprofits and houses of worship can keep people safe as they engage with those they serve,"" said Lankford. ""As anti-Semitism reached a frightening new high last year, we must continue to find ways to help prevent terrorist acts and also empower our nonprofits to proactively establish safeguards and security measures, which they sadly need to do but don't necessarily have the funds to fully accomplish without these opportunities for federal assistance.""

I will always fight to expand NSGP grants so that New Yorkers, and Americans across the country, can gather communally or worship freely and safely, against the threat of violence.""
""FEMA's Nonprofit Security Grant Program is vitally important to ensure nonprofits, particularly faith-based organizations, have the resources necessary to invest in physical security enhancements, training, and contract security personnel to protect against potential attacks. At a time when we have seen a rise in violence against communities of faith, we have a responsibility to ensure this program is appropriately funded to protect at-risk organizations and communities. I am proud to join my bipartisan colleagues to support this crucial program,"" said Portman.
""Places of worship should be a safe haven, and the Nonprofit Security Grant Program is a vital resource for synagogues, mosques and churches that are working to protect their congregations in light of tragic attacks,"" said Peters. ""I have long championed this program, and I'm proud to join my colleagues to call for robust funding that will help ensure houses of worship, cultural institutions and nonprofit organizations in Michigan and across the country can use this important tool to improve their security and continue serving our communities.""
""Anti-Semitic violence in the US has grown at an alarming rate,"" said Rosen. ""Whether it's in Nevada or in any state across the country, we must stand up against hateful violence. I am proud to join my colleagues in demanding that we properly protect places of worship. I will continue working to ensure the security and safety for Nevadans and all Americans.""
""Jewish communities worldwide have witnessed firsthand the rise of antisemitism and hate motivated violent attacks. In our schools, synagogues and community centers we have been targeted by hate and extremists and those looking to mimic their disgusting and deplorable tactics,"" said Eric Fingerhut, President and CEO of the Jewish Federations of North America. ""We know that eradicating antisemitism means addressing violent hate and extremism wherever it exits in partnership with our elected officials and law enforcement. For these reasons we thank Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, along with Senators Rob Portman, Gary Peters, James Lankford and Jackie Rosen, for their leadership on urging increased funding this year to meet the growing security needs of nonprofit faith- and community-based organizations.""
Every year, Congress must specifically allocate funding for the NSGP, which helps nonprofits, deemed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to be at risk of attack, plan for and ready themselves against potential attacks. In addition to hardening facilities, this program has improved efforts to keep at-risk nonprofit organizations safe by promoting emergency preparedness coordination and collaboration activities between public and private community representatives, as well as with state and local government agencies.
Read the text of the letter here or below:
Dear Chairmen Shelby and Capito, Vice Chairman Leahy, and Ranking Member Tester,
Thank you for your continued support for the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP) under the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) and the State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP). As you finalize the Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 Homeland Security Appropriations bill, we respectfully ask you to fund NSGP at the funding level that reflects increased risks to the nonprofit sector. Presently, the House and Senate drafts are far apart on recommended levels of funding for the program. The House top line is $360 million and the Senate's $90 million. During conference, we urge you to ensure the NSGP is appropriately funded to meet the needs of at-risk populations. At a time of heightened threat to nonprofit faith- and community-based organizations, a bolstered NSGP will continue to provide our nonprofit partners with critical resources and tools they need to protect lives and property.
The NSGP provides for grants to nonprofits deemed at risk of terrorist (or violent extremist) attack, to acquire and install physical security enhancements, conduct preparedness planning, training and exercises, and contract security personnel. The program has improved efforts to keep at-risk nonprofit organizations safe by promoting emergency preparedness coordination and collaboration between public and private community representatives as well as state and local government agencies. Today's quickly evolving threat environment provides a compelling public interest in protecting against attacks on the nonprofit sector that would disrupt the vital health, human, social, cultural, religious, and other humanitarian services and practices they provide to communities, and which threaten the lives and well-being of millions of Americans who operate, utilize, live, and work in proximity to them.
At the beginning of this year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Homeland Security and National Counterterrorism Center jointly assessed that Domestic Violent Extremists and Racially/Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremists (RMVEs) will continue to pose a lethal threat to faith-based communities, particularly the Jewish community, and remain concerned about the difficulty of detecting lone offenders due to the individualized nature of the radicalization process.[1] During a recent Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearing on threats to the Homeland, FBI Director Christopher Wray testified that the number one threat the nation faces from domestic violent extremists stems from RMVEs, who are considered the most lethal of all domestic extremists in the post-911 environment.[2] To illustrate his point, Director Wray recounted the arrest last November of Richard Holzer on federal domestic terrorism and hate crime charges for attempting to blow up a historic synagogue in Pueblo, Colorado and provoke ""a racial holy war.""[3]
Additionally, according to the latest FBI Hate Crime Statistics 2019 report,[4] which was released earlier this month, reported hate crimes motivated by religious bias increased by 100 to a total of 1,650 in 2019, of which more than 60 percent were anti-Jewish incidents (a more than 14 percent increase). Per this reporting, the Jewish community remains the top target of faith-based hate crimes for the 23rd consecutive year.
These assessments underscore the persistent threat of lethal violence and hate crimes against the Jewish community and other faith- and community-based institutions in the United States. These groups have too frequently been the victim of many different types of violence. At this time of rising concern, FEMA has reported that on average only about one-third of nonprofits seeking critical security investments secure funding, annually.[5] The requests exceed the available resources every year. Yet, in today's threat environment, demand for NSGP resources is expected to grow substantially more, further widening the needs gap.
Since its inception, the program has maintained bi-partisan, bicameral support as an efficient and effective means to accomplish a great deal of security enhancement and preparedness through modest grants.[6] With this support and for the reasons stated above, we respectfully encourage you to bolster the NSGP funding, so our nation can do all that it can to protect at-risk faith- and community- based nonprofits from increasing extremist and hate-motivated threats.
Thank you for your consideration of this request.
Sincerely,
###

The highly anticipated TV series will air during a popular night, Thursday, just after his old series Law & Order SUV. 
The series will debut sometime in the fall after the cast and crew are allowed to film after the coronavirus pandemic lockdown eases up.
The show will come on Thursday nights at 10 pm with SVU airing just before it at 9 pm. Other shows on that night are Superstore, starting at 8 pm and Brooklyn Nine-Nine at 8:30.
The 58-year-old actor will reprise his role as Elliot Stabler, according to Deadline.
 NBC had already committed to taking the show straight to series months ago; there will be a total of 13 episode for season one.
The new series will be set in New York City and it centers on the New York Police Department organized crime unit, which is run by Stabler. 
Stabler sadly has experienced a 'devastating personal loss,' according to NBC.
The city and police department have 'changed dramatically in the decade he's been away, and he must adapt to a criminal justice system in the midst of its own moment of reckoning,' it was added.
Stabler has to 'rebuild his life,' while leading a 'new elite task force that is taking apart the city's most powerful criminal syndicates one by one.'
The 6ft tall actor may have some guest appearances by his longtime L&O: SVU costar Mariska Hargitay who still plays Olivia Benson on the show.
The original plan was to introduce the Stabler family in the season 21 finale but that idea was ditched when the pandemic struck.
Now, Stabler will be reintroduce during the season 22 premiere of SVU.
'We were just going to lay some groundwork down in anticipation of Elliot's return of course in his own series,' said SVU showrunner Warren Leight.
'We had the sense that the first episode of next year for SVU was going to bring Elliot back, so we were going to foreshadow that and explain a little more what happened to Simon,' he added.
'Whether we'll get to see his family as well, remains to be seen. There's a lot of moving parts,' he stated. 'It's not just about the SVU season opener, it's how do we help launch the new series and how much crossover will there be between Elliot and Olivia as the season goes on.""
Law & Order: SVU has a lot on its plate next season as it will reportedly address George Floyd's death by a police officer and the subsequent protests. 
Meloni left Law & Order: SVU after season 12 when his character - who is married with five kids - suddenly quits the police force. 
After leaving SVU Chris popped up on several TV shows including The Handmaid's Tale.
This new series is from Law & Order creator Dick Wolf who has a five year deal with NBC Universal. He is executive producing with Arthur W. Forney and Peter Jankowski.
Wolf has six scripted shows on the air: NBC's Law & Order: SVU, Chicago PD, Chicago Fire and Chicago Med; and CBS' FBI and spinoff FBI: Most Wanted.
There is another SVU spinoff called Hate Crimes, which may debut on NBCU's upcoming streaming service Peacock that is supposed to start in April.
The shows that have renewed for 2020-2021 include The Blacklist, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, New Amsterdam, Superstore and This Is Us. And the new shows include Young Rock (starring Dwayne Johnson), the untitled L.A. mayor comedy (featuring Ted Danson) and The Kenan Show, which is being redeveloped.
Chris has been married to 60-year-old Sherman Williams since 1995 and together they have two children: Sophia, 19, and Dante, 16. The star has been posting images to social media as he self-isolates. "

""Places of worship should be a safe haven, and the Nonprofit Security Grant Program is a vital resource for synagogues, mosques and churches that are working to protect their congregations in light of tragic attacks,"" said Peters. ""I have long championed this program, and I'm proud to join my colleagues to call for robust funding that will help ensure houses of worship, cultural institutions and nonprofit organizations in Michigan and across the country can use this important tool to improve their security and continue serving our communities.""
""Anti-Semitic violence in the US has grown at an alarming rate,"" said RoSen. ""Whether it's in Nevada or in any state across the country, we must stand up against hateful violence. I am proud to join my colleagues in demanding that we properly protect places of worship. I will continue working to ensure the security and safety for Nevadans and all Americans.""
""Jewish communities worldwide have witnessed firsthand the rise of antisemitism and hate motivated violent attacks. In our schools, synagogues and community centers we have been targeted by hate and extremists and those looking to mimic their disgusting and deplorable tactics,"" said Eric Fingerhut, President and CEO of the Jewish Federations of North America. ""We know that eradicating antisemitism means addressing violent hate and extremism wherever it exits in partnership with our elected officials and law enforcement. For these reasons we thank Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, along with Senators Rob Portman, Gary Peters, James Lankford and Jackie Rosen, for their leadership on urging increased funding this year to meet the growing security needs of nonprofit faith- and community-based organizations.""
Every year, Congress must specifically allocate funding for the NSGP, which helps nonprofits, deemed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to be at risk of attack, plan for and ready themselves against potential attacks. In addition to hardening facilities, this program has improved efforts to keep at-risk nonprofit organizations safe by promoting emergency preparedness coordination and collaboration activities between public and private community representatives, as well as with state and local government agencies.

Dear Chairmen Shelby and Capito, Vice Chairman Leahy, and Ranking Member Tester,
Thank you for your continued support for the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP) under the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) and the State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP). As you finalize the Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 Homeland Security Appropriations bill, we respectfully ask you to fund NSGP at the funding level that reflects increased risks to the nonprofit sector. Presently, the House and Senate drafts are far apart on recommended levels of funding for the program. The House top line is $360 million and the Senate's $90 million. During conference, we urge you to ensure the NSGP is appropriately funded to meet the needs of at-risk populations. At a time of heightened threat to nonprofit faith- and community-based organizations, a bolstered NSGP will continue to provide our nonprofit partners with critical resources and tools they need to protect lives and property.
The NSGP provides for grants to nonprofits deemed at risk of terrorist (or violent extremist) attack, to acquire and install physical security enhancements, conduct preparedness planning, training and exercises, and contract security personnel. The program has improved efforts to keep at-risk nonprofit organizations safe by promoting emergency preparedness coordination and collaboration between public and private community representatives as well as state and local government agencies. Today's quickly evolving threat environment provides a compelling public interest in protecting against attacks on the nonprofit sector that would disrupt the vital health, human, social, cultural, religious, and other humanitarian services and practices they provide to communities, and which threaten the lives and well-being of millions of Americans who operate, utilize, live, and work in proximity to them.
At the beginning of this year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Homeland Security and National Counterterrorism Center jointly assessed that Domestic Violent Extremists and Racially/Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremists (RMVEs) will continue to pose a lethal threat to faith-based communities, particularly the Jewish community, and remain concerned about the difficulty of detecting lone offenders due to the individualized nature of the radicalization process.[1] During a recent Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearing on threats to the Homeland, FBI Director Christopher Wray testified that the number one threat the nation faces from domestic violent extremists stems from RMVEs, who are considered the most lethal of all domestic extremists in the post-911 environment.[2] To illustrate his point, Director Wray recounted the arrest last November of Richard Holzer on federal domestic terrorism and hate crime charges for attempting to blow up a historic synagogue in Pueblo, Colorado and provoke ""a racial holy war.""[3]
Additionally, according to the latest FBI Hate Crime Statistics 2019 report,[4] which was released earlier this month, reported hate crimes motivated by religious bias increased by 100 to a total of 1,650 in 2019, of which more than 60 percent were anti-Jewish incidents (a more than 14 percent increase). Per this reporting, the Jewish community remains the top target of faith-based hate crimes for the 23rd consecutive year.
These assessments underscore the persistent threat of lethal violence and hate crimes against the Jewish community and other faith- and community-based institutions in the United States. These groups have too frequently been the victim of many different types of violence. At this time of rising concern, FEMA has reported that on average only about one-third of nonprofits seeking critical security investments secure funding, annually.[5] The requests exceed the available resources every year. Yet, in today's threat environment, demand for NSGP resources is expected to grow substantially more, further widening the needs gap.
Since its inception, the program has maintained bi-partisan, bicameral support as an efficient and effective means to accomplish a great deal of security enhancement and preparedness through modest grants.[6] With this support and for the reasons stated above, we respectfully encourage you to bolster the NSGP funding, so our nation can do all that it can to protect at-risk faith- and community- based nonprofits from increasing extremist and hate-motivated threats.
Thank you for your consideration of this request.
Sincerely,

I am of the strong opinion that Israelis should not engage in or interfere with American politics, and I regularly offer a blanket thank you to all American presidents, including Obama, for their economic and military support for Israel. However, his memoir, A Promised Land, is filled with historical inaccuracies that I feel the need to address. His telling of Israel's story (at the beginning of Chapter 25) not only exhibits a flawed understanding of the region—which clearly impacted his policies as president—but misleads readers in a way that will forever shape their negative perspective of the Jewish state. 
Obama relates, for example, how the British were 'occupying Palestine' when they issued the Balfour Declaration calling for a Jewish state. But labeling Great Britain as an 'occupier' clearly casts doubt on its legitimacy to determine anything about the future of the Holy Land—and that wasn't the situation. While it is true that England had no legal rights in Palestine when the Balfour Declaration was issued in 1917, that changed just five years later. The League of Nations, precursor to the United Nations, gave the British legal rights over Palestine in its 1922 'Mandate for Palestine,' which specifically mentions 'the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people.' The League also said that 'recognition has thereby been given to the historical connection of the Jewish people with Palestine and to the grounds for reconstituting their national home in that country.' The former president's noted omission of the internationally agreed-upon mandate for the British to establish a home for the Jews in Palestine misinforms the reader, who will conclude that the movement for a Jewish state in Palestine had no legitimacy or international consent. 'Over the next 20 years, Zionist leaders mobilized a surge of Jewish migration to Palestine,' Obama writes, creating the image that once the British illegally began the process of forming a Jewish state in Palestine, Jews suddenly started flocking there.https://1.bp.blogspot.com/proxy/ezoB8Hyqc7S-XjLDu9An0nv4uRRDtyZcnJ4HprAHTy3SJeytOXuIsZoZeK-5t6xnIKrg5WoT2zzUrBXtKl_4=s400-dSupreme Court Blocks Cuomo's Limits On Synagogues, Churches in Thanksgiving Ruling[2]The Supreme Court sided with a coalition of Orthodox Jewish groups and the Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn Thursday in an emergency appeal that alleged New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's (D.) COVID-related worship restrictions discriminate against Jews and violate the First Amendment. The vote in the early Thanksgiving morning ruling was five to four, with Chief Justice John Roberts and the liberal trio in dissent. ""Statements made in connection with the challenged rules can be viewed as targeting the 'ultra-Orthodox Jewish' community. But even if we put those comments aside, the regulations cannot be viewed as neutral because they single out houses of worship for especially harsh treatment,"" the majority wrote in an unsigned opinion. Cuomo's contested regulations establish three kinds of hotspot zones with corresponding restrictions. In red zones, where transmission is highest, church attendance is capped at 10. In less severe orange zones, that number is 25, while houses of worship in yellow zones may open at 50 percent attendance. A portion of Brooklyn and about half of Queens are currently in yellow zones. ""It is time—past time—to make plain that, while the pandemic poses many grave challenges, there is no world in which the Constitution tolerates color-coded executive edicts that reopen liquor stores and bike shops but shutter churches, synagogues, and mosques,"" Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in defense of the ruling. Turkish state media and New York local media seem indistinguishable in their antisemitic messaging during the COVID crisis. pic.twitter.com/EQzWfJFj8q[3] — The Conspiracy Libel (@ConspiracyLibel) November 25, 2020[4] Holocaust Analogies and Twenty-First-Century Victimhood[5]Food Network chef Alton Brown recently starred in his own Holocaust-related Twitter controversy. After angering some fans by sharing that he has voted for Republicans in the past, Brown wrote in since-deleted tweets, 'Do you think the camp uniforms will be striped, like the ones at Auschwitz or will plaid be in vogue?' Someone responded, 'Depends on what you're worth going in,' to which Brown replied, 'I have no gold fillings.' Yes, a privileged American, enjoying a life of freedom, compared himself to Jews targeted for dehumanization and elimination. Brown referenced concentration camp prisoners' uniforms and the forcible removal of gold teeth to assert his own victim status. He has since apologized for 'the flippant reference' to the Holocaust, saying it 'reflect[ed] how deeply frightened I am for our country.' An apology is a positive step, but let's be clear: Whatever problems one sees in 2020 America, we're not living in Nazi Germany. More important, Brown's comments aren't the story of one man's bad week on Twitter. Rather, they illustrate a troubling trend. Seventy-five years after the liberation of Auschwitz, we're living betwixt dangerous cross currents. On the one hand, too few Americans know the history of the Holocaust or what anti-Semitism is. On the other, a sizable segment of our culture lionizes victimhood. The result is a lot of people insisting that they're the real Jews, persecuted and suffering. A 2018 survey commissioned by the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany found that 11 percent of American adults 'haven't heard' or weren't 'sure if they have heard' of the Holocaust, and 22 percent of millennials said the same. Furthermore, 41 percent of all American adults and 66 percent of millennials 'cannot identify what Auschwitz was.' A recently released American Jewish Committee survey on anti-Semitism found that only 53 percent of the American public 'has heard of antisemitism and knows what it means.' Twenty-one percent said they had never even heard the term. There's a need for widespread education about Jew hate. However, it's not clear our political, cultural, and media elites will do the necessary informing. U.S . House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn has repeatedly compared Trump's America to Hitler's Germany. Actor John Cusack, who previously had his own Twitter anti-Semitism controversy, responded to the Million MAGA March by tweeting 'Dutechland [sic] Uber alles.' Actor Alec Baldwin has tweeted, 'Bury Trump in a Nazi graveyard and put a swastika on his grave.' And then there's the media. There's minimal media coverage of anti-Semitism outside the Jewish press, but what there is can sometimes be harmful. For example, CNN's Christiane Amanpour likened Trump's presidency to Kristallnacht, which she called 'the Nazis' warning shot across the bow of our human civilization that led to genocide against a whole identity.' With that statement, Amanpour erased 6 million murdered Jews from a discussion about the Holocaust. After a public outcry, Amanpour expressed 'regret' for linking Kristallnacht and Trump's America, but said nothing about having replaced 'Jews' with the generic 'identity.' There are a lot of places suitable for hosting a George Floyd exhibit...but a Holocaust museum is NOT one of them. I'll tell you why: https://t.co/ib14SQlAiO[6] — Dov Hikind (@HikindDov) November 25, 2020[7] 22% of hate crimes in Europe in 2019 were against Jews, report shows[8]Antisemitic incidents accounted for 22% of hate crimes recorded last year in the pan-European region, though Jews comprise less than 1% of the population there. The data on hate crimes comes from a report about 5,954 incidents recorded in Europe, Russia and Central Asia by the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, or ODHIR, of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, or OSCE, ODHIR said in its annual report published last week. The report is based on data transmitted by governments and watchdog groups. Of the total incidents, 1,311 were antisemitic, according to the the report titled '2019 Hate Crime Data.' Antisemitism was the category with the second-largest number of incidents after the 2,371 incidents in the more general Racism and Xenophobia category. Those targeted for their gender or sexual orientation (1,277 cases) made up the third-highest group, followed by Christians (573) and Muslims (507). Antizionism isn't criticism of a government.Antizionism , at its extreme, is a conspiracy theory that singles out one group as an international villain responsible for human suffering everywhere.This is what was once said about the Jews. And it still is. See 'antizionism' pic.twitter.com/aJkUBc7Uh0[9] — The Conspiracy Libel (@ConspiracyLibel) November 26, 2020[10] ;The Syrian Prime Minister Who Was a French Double Agent and Tipped Off Zionist Leaders about British Plans[11]In 1945, Britain and France were rivals for control over the Middle East, and the former hoped to keep the Land of Israel under the authority of a friendly Arab ruler, while expanding its influence into the French protectorate of Syria. The British had at the time recruited Jamil Mardam Bey, a senior minister in the Syrian government, to work for them. When French intelligence caught him, they managed to turn him to their side. Meir Zamir, drawing on newly revealed archival materials, discovered something surprising about this relationship: It all began in October 1945, when the French encountered a new problem. Mardam had been appointed Syria's ambassador to Egypt and its envoy to the Arab League headquarters in Cairo, but the French had a hard time utilizing him there without arousing suspicion. The solution was to recruit Eliahu Sasson for the mission of relaying the information provided by Mardam. Sasson, who was then the head of the Arab division of the Jewish Agency's political department, had been appointed by the Agency's head David Ben-Gurion in February 1945 to coordinate cooperation with French intelligence. The Syrian-born Sasson knew Mardam and had met with him in 1937, when the latter had served as prime minister, [a position to which he would later return]. The French, who were well acquainted with Sasson and thought highly of his operational capabilities, began to collaborate with him in handling Mardam. From July 1945, Ben-Gurion had prepared for the possibility of an attack by the Arab states should the Jewish state declare its independence. But the information from Mardam turned the spotlight elsewhere. Ben-Gurion learned that the immediate threat to the establishment of the Jewish state lay not in an attack by Arab armies, but rather in the plan of British military commanders and intelligence agencies in the Middle East to thwart that development by various other means. These included declaring the Haganah militia a terrorist organization and disarming it, and implementing the 'Greater Syria plan,' under which a limited Jewish entity would be created in Mandatory Palestine, but not an independent state.A French television drama shows courage in depicting the true scope of the country's crimes during the Holocaust, which it then washes away in a bizarre assertion of moral equivalence[12]This bold and still-controversial statement was the work of the series' creator, Frdric Krivine. He is the son of radical left-wing parents and the nephew of Alain Krivine, who was jailed by de Gaulle for leading the 1968 protests. As chief consultant for his production, the writer chose Jean-Pierre Azma, a noted leftist historian. This no doubt explains the sentimental portrayal of the communists and the brutal depiction of every American GI. But Krivine is also Jewish and has described Un Village Franais as 'a good Jewish story.' But good in what way? Clearly it cannot be in France, where the survivors see no future. For two of them, the answer is Palestine. 'A land without a people for a people without a land,' one of them says, unknowingly quoting a 19th-century Christian Zionist. 'I just want to live in a place without fighting.' All of this is meant ironically, though, as we see in the final season in which the now-married pair—the woman is played by Krivine's wife, Axelle Maricq—is driving a Haganah ambulance. Ambushed by Arabs shouting 'Deir Yassin! Deir Yassin!' the husband explains that this was a Palestinian village in which 'our people killed two hundred innocent men, women, and children'—curiously echoing the Palestinian narrative of that event, which is strongly disputed by most Israeli historians. His wife cries, 'We're no better than those who oppressed us in France!' Voil. So, this, after 72 episodes, is what Un Village Franais is ultimately about. Yes, we were horrible to the Jews, but look—they're no better toward the Arabs than we were toward them. French guilt for the Holocaust can be conveniently cleansed by the invocation of supposedly equivalent Israeli wrongdoing—which must be monstrously magnified and exaggerated in order to make the equation work. Interviewed by The Nation, Frdric Krivine compared French indifference to the plight of Jews during WWII to the Israeli public's lack of response to the IDF's killing of Gazans. Far from indicting France for its Holocaust crimes, Krivine has in fact forgiven it. That message was conveyed to the 3.4 million French viewers who, on average, watched every hour of Un Village Franais and to the many millions more in the 40 countries that rebroadcast it. They received first-class drama and acting, a courageous reexamination of French history—and a not-too-subliminal message about Israel being the ultimate guilty party, whose Nazi-like actions perversely cleanse the French of their own crimes in a bath of invented equivalence. This libel corresponds with the unremitting rise of anti-Semitism in France. From the Front National on the right and Islamic extremists often backed by the left, as well as from 'yellow vest' protesters, Jews are once again the target—so much so that 77% of French Jews now see anti-Semitism as a major threat. As a result, increasing numbers of Jews are leaving France for Israel. The signs in my Jaffa neighborhood are all in French and there are numerous Francophonic synagogues. Starting in 2014, French immigration to Israel surpassed that from the United States, and tens of thousands more are expected. Contrary to the conclusion of Un Village Franais that Jews are physically threatened no matter where they go, and morally imperiled by Israel, these immigrants see the Jewish state as safer than France—for good reason. As for my friend, learning about the fate of his French family at Yad Vashem changed him fundamentally. Rather than rejecting his Jewish identity, he began to embrace it and is today strictly observant. He is proud of his French roots but knows that in the terroirs de France they could never flower.Hawaii's Congressman-elect Kai Kahele vows to oppose BDS, fight anti-Semitism[13]Say 'aloha' to Hawaii's newest member of Congress, Kai Kahele, who told JNS in an interview earlier this month that his state ""has always had a very unique relationship with the State of Israel."" Kahele's state boasts Jewish history and, as of 2014, was home to 7,500 Jews, not to mention hordes of tourists annually. The islands are home to several synagogues and Chabad Houses. The 46-year-old Democrat, who is married with three daughters and was elected to Congress from Hawaii's 2nd Congressional District, expressed his appreciation for the late Sen. Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), who was known as a strong supporter of Israel. ""My position is the same,"" said Kahele. ""And that's an unconditional commitment to Israel."" He remarked that ""Israel is a very strong partner"" and the ""best example of democracy and the American values that we have in the Middle East.""Douglas Macgregor's anti-Semitic comments disqualify him from serving at the Pentagon[14]The staff of acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller recently grew, as retired Army Col. Douglas Macgregor was appointed as his senior adviser. Such an announcement would typically be ho-hum staffing news but not in this case. Macgregor has made fairly extensive comments about 'the Israel lobby,' which he claims has bought off high-level American officials, including former national security adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Like Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, Macgregor criticized the ""enormous influence"" Israel supporters have on Congress and attacked the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. Macgregor, who was once in line to be ambassador to Germany, lost out after outlets such as the Hill reported on his saying that 'Germany's efforts to grapple with its role in the Holocaust was a 'sick mentality,'' among other jaw-dropping comments. All of these remarks raise two big questions. First, given the extensive scrutiny Omar's comments attracted in early 2019, why haven't Macgregor's been given similar attention? And second, if Macgregor was too toxic to be an ambassador as recently as the summer, why does Miller want him as a senior adviser? Let's consider the first question first. There are those who believe Omar was unfairly criticized, but context helps explain why many people reacted strongly, in addition to her comments' content. Omar's three early anti-Semitic scandals kicked off in January 2019, two-plus months after 11 Jews were gunned down at Sabbath services in a Pittsburgh synagogue. The whole nation mourned with the Jewish community after the Tree of Life massacre. So, metaphorical alarms sounded when a new congresswoman expressed the sort of sentiments that endanger Jews. Omar's scandals also proved a real institutional test. Other than New York Reps. Nita Lowey and Eliot Engel, who countered Omar publicly (on Twitter), the House completely failed. It couldn't collectively criticize Omar's anti-Semitism without simultaneously criticizing a laundry list of other hatreds. Omar not only survived her scandals without apologizing by the end, but she also kept her seat on the prestigious Foreign Affairs Committee.Plaid Cymru divided: One former leader appears to endorse claim that Labour antisemitism accusations are 'smear', while another former leader says Party 'cannot tolerate' antisemitism[15]Plaid Cymru has seen two former leaders at odds over antisemitism, with one appearing to endorse conspiratorial denials of antisemitism in the Labour Party and another calling for no tolerance of anti-Jewish racism. Leanne Wood, who served as leader of the Welsh Nationalist Party until 2018, appeared to endorse tweets by a controversial American journalist that read: 'I've never seen a more flagrant, repellent and cynical exploitation of antisemitism in my life than its disgusting use to smear [Jeremy] Corbyn because of a lack of alternatives for how to defeat him. Nothing has trivialized this cause more than what British Blairites have done.' A further tweet in the thread said: 'Jeremy Corbyn is a better human being by a multiple of about 1,000 than all of the Oxbridge cretins in politics and media who have united to cynically smear him with accusations they know in their rotted souls are false.' This is not the first time that Ms Wood has waded into the Labour antisemitism scandal, coming to the apparent defence of Rebecca Long-Bailey, who was sacked from Labour's Shadow Cabinet earlier this year after she promoted an article containing an antisemitic conspiracy theory. Plaid Cymru, after a recent antisemitism scandal, has announced that it is holding a review into antisemitism in its Party, to which Campaign Against Antisemitism shall be making submissions. The review will be led by the Party's Westminster leader, Liz Saville Roberts MP.

Nicholas Nelson, 31, admitted to three charges of sending communications of an offensive nature between July and September 2018. Recommended The indictment related to phone calls and emails sent to Dame Margaret Hodge and Dame Louise Ellman - both of whom are Jewish. Nelson also sent abuse to Lord John Mann, the former MP for Bassetlaw in Nottinghamshire, who now serves as an antisemitism tsar. Lord Mann has long campaigned against antisemitism but is not Jewish. In 2018, Nelson was sentenced to 20 weeks in jail - suspended for a year - for harassing Jewish MPs Luciana Berger and Ruth Smeeth. Neither are still in parliament. At Westminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday, Deputy Chief Magistrate Tan Ikram sentenced Nelson to 30 weeks in jail - suspended for 18 months. The magistrate said: ""I'm of the view that these offences are so serious that they cross the custody threshold. ""People should feel able to come forward and serve as MPs without fear of violence and threat. Certain communities have felt particularly under threat. ""And these courts will send a clear message to those who threaten members of those communities, who attack them because of their faith.""NGO Monitor: Norwegian Refugee Council Report on Children - Political Attacks Funded by the EU[25]On November 12, 2020, the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) published 'Raided and Razed: Attacks on West Bank Education,' a 44-page report alleging '296 attacks against education by Israeli forces or settlers and settlement private security guards' in January 2008 - June 2020. The publication was funded by the Norwegian government (Representative Office to the PA) and the EU (ECHO). Notably, the EU also funded a highly politicized and misleading report based on allegations regarding detention of Palestinian children, published in October by Save the Children. The Campaign to Blacklist the IDF at the UNFor many years, NRC, Save the Children, alongside Defence for Children International Palestine (DCIP),1 and other advocacy NGOs have lobbied the UN Secretary-General intensively to include the IDF on the list of the world's worst violators of children's rights. (Currently, only terrorist organizations, state-sponsored militias, and armed forces of failed states are on the list.) The goal of their campaign is to trigger UN Security Council sanctions against Israel, by listing the IDF in the annex to the Sec-Gen's annual report by the UN Secretary-General. Entities found to be systematically violating at least one of five 'trigger' and 'grave violations' identified in Security Council Resolution 1612 can be included in the annex.2 These include 'recruitment and use,' 'killing and maiming,' 'rape and other forms of sexual violence against children,' 'attacks on schools and hospitals,' and 'abduction of children.' As part of the campaign against Israel, and in the absence of evidence of 'grave violations,' the NRC claims to document incidents of 'attacks on education.' 'Attacks on education' is not a legal term; it was invented by NGOs to broaden the UN definition of 'attacks on schools and hospitals' and is used in the context of Palestinians with the cynical objective of including Israel on the Secretary-General's list. UK's Buckinghamshire New University adopts IHRA antisemitism definition[26]Buckinghamshire New University has become the latest higher learning institution in the United Kingdom to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's (IHRA) definition of antisemitism. The decision was made by the university's senate and council last week in order to advance the institution's ""historic mission to create a learning community that is truly inclusive,"" according to a university statement. However, while the university did adopt the IHRA definition, it did so alongside two additional clarifications, which state that criticizing the Israeli government is not inherently antisemitic, nor is holding Israel's government to the same standards as other liberal democracies or taking interest in Israeli policies or actions. 'Antisemitism is repugnant. It is a form of racism, has no place within society and will not be tolerated at our University,"" vice chancellor Prof. Nick Braisby said in a statement. ""Our decision to adopt the IHRA's definition of antisemitism demonstrates our commitment to be an inclusive community that welcomes and celebrates all of our members irrespective of their background or ethnicity. Adopting the IHRA definition is an important step in our ongoing work towards eradicating racism, harassment, discrimination and prejudice.'Exporting Racism: The latest slander against Israel[27]In April, leadership at Tufts University outside Boston was embarrassed when it was disclosed that Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), the toxic anti-Israel group with a sordid history of campus activism, had been given 'The Collaboration Award' by the Office for Campus Life for the group's role in exposing what they refer to as The Deadly Exchange—partnerships and cooperation between U.S . law enforcement and Israeli security forces. Tufts president Anthony Monaco immediately tried distancing the university from SJP's award, saying that he 'would be reviewing the awards process' to clarify why the divisive SJP—which promotes boycotts against Israel on the 200 or so campuses where it has chapters—should be hailed for collaborating at all, let alone winning an award. The Deadly Exchange program provided an irresistible bit of additional weaponry for Israel-haters in the cognitive war against the Jewish state, particularly after the death of George Floyd in May and the rapid ascent since then of Black Lives Matter in the racial consciousness of activists on and off campus. The longstanding narrative which portrayed Israel as a racist, apartheid oppressor of brown Palestinians was given new relevance when it could be suggested that the same racist white police officers who were being accused of randomly killing black men in the United States were being trained—and made even more lethal and dangerous—by the IDF. 'The Deadly Exchange between the U.S. and Israel solidifies and augments both countries' methods and equipment for state violence and control,' SJP members wrote in a letter in the Tufts Daily, 'including mass surveillance, racial profiling and suppression of protest and dissent.' The November 23rd letter was part of a SJP effort to 'have a referendum on the ballot as a part of our campaign to End the Deadly Exchange at Tufts,' with the primary goal of 'demanding the Tufts administration prohibit TUPD officers from attending military-led and/or similar international trips in the future, refine the vetting process to prevent prior attendees from being hired, and apologize for sending [in 2017] the former Tufts police chief to a militarized training trip.' And what is the rationale for having members of the Tufts police department not hone their skills in programs with Israeli security forces? To end the systemic racism of law enforcement, of course. 'Our referendum is seeking to promote the safety of students,' SJP contended, and 'especially' students of color.Amazon's Alexa shares antisemitic responses, UK MPs demand investigation[28]Amazon's Alexa could be used as a means to spread antisemitic views and conspiracies, causing concern among some British lawmakers. As explained Wednesday by Conservative Party MP Andrew Percy, Amazon's virtual artificial intelligence assistant product often responds to certain questions about Jews, the Holocaust and Israel ""by quoting antisemitic conspiracy websites and using selective quotes from other sources which are misleading without further explanation."" In one example, shared by CFI on Twitter, when asked if Jews control the media, Alexa responds: ""Here's something I found from the article 'Jew Watch' on Wikipedia: Jew Watch claims that Jews control the world's financial systems and media."" Another video showed Alexa responding to a question about the Elders of Zion by stating: ""Here's something I found on the web: According to palwatch.org, the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, the swindlers of Zion have revealed their schemes to subjugate the nations and gain control of the world."" MUST READ: CFI Vice-Chairman Andrew Percy MP expresses concern over Amazon Alexa responses which 'lend credibility to antisemitic views' and urges the Home Secretary to ""immediately investigate"" the issue in a letter today.https://t.co/Nz5ErdY9eX[29];Full letter pic.twitter.com/wfY61n4pBR[30] — CFoI (@CFoI) November 25, 2020[31] PreOccupiedTerritory: Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain Denounce Israel's Ties With 'Racist, Islamophobic' Europe, US (satire)[32]Persian Gulf states in the process of rapprochement with the Jewish State voiced their misgivings today over the latter's diplomatic relations with various other countries whose reputation for tolerance and diversity have long been questionable, and express grave concern that maintaining such relations will only further enable those regimes to continue in their prejudiced ways. Reports emerged Sunday that Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu had met in Saudi Arabia with Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman, in what most observers interpret as indication of the impending establishment of formal diplomatic and economic ties between the two nations. The development comes on the heels of similar events in the region, with Israel and several other states announcing normalization over the last two months: the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Oman, plus several others with quieter, parallel outcomes, such as Sudan. At the same time, officials in those countries made their dismay known over the fact that Israel still has ties to Islamophobic societies such as France, Poland, the US, and others, and that recent normalization can only appear as condoning Israel's relations with those distasteful regimes. 'It's diplomacy, which is to say, politics, so no one is expecting only to encounter pristine interlocutors,' allowed Saudi minister Prince Tur Nabout. 'Still, we must not turn a blind eye to the implications of establishing ties with a country that also keeps close ties with some of the most Islamophobic places on the planet, as even their own media have reminded us again and again since 2016. We must conduct a balancing act of sorts, pursuing our interests vis--vis Israel while maintaining an insistence that we do not accept their acceptance of the unacceptable.'Fabricator and fraudster [33]The fact that fabrications can so easily be found in Robert Fisk's work destroys his legacy of award-winning reporting So let's separate the myths from the facts. Fisk did not speak fluent Arabic, not even after living in the Middle East for more than 40 years. Leaving aside the testimony of Arabic speakers who worked alongside him, his lack of basic knowledge of the language is contained multiple times within his own work, such as his inability to tell the difference between the words 'mother' and 'nation' in a well-known Ba'athist slogan. Fisk's reputation among scholars and journalists in the Middle East was destroyed by years of distortions of the truth in his work on Syria. But even before he started embracing pro-Assad conspiracy theories, Fisk's relationship with the truth was widely scrutinised. It is a monumental absurdity that we have a word, 'Fisking', in the Cambridge English Dictionary derived from his surname, without any mention of him. The dictionary defines it as 'the act of making an argument seem wrong or stupid by showing the mistakes in each of its points, or an instance of doing this.' The frequency with which falsehoods can be found in Fisk's work wasn't so much an open secret as a widely shared joke understood by all who worked in the industry. Fisk got away with it because he always got away with it. The falsehoods he published were often tolerated, excused or dismissed because people agreed with the stories he was telling. But our job as journalists, especially in the Middle East, isn't to tell stories — it's to tell the truth. Following Fisk's passing, away from the newspaper obituaries, an entirely different narrative was expressed by those who saw him up close. Syrian journalist Asser Khatab wrote an excoriating article for the online platform Raseef22, sharing his experiences of working alongside him in Homs, including his lack of Arabic and his reliance on a translator connected with the Syrian mukhabarat (secret police). 'Fisk talked about places we did not visit and incidents that we did not witness,' Khatab said. 'His interviews with officials, including the governor, were full of long, eloquent and expressive phrases. I do not know where they came from.'Financial Times promotes false stereotype of Christian Zionists[34]The FT claim concerning what motivates Christian Zionists is an extremely misleading stereotype. As CAMERA's Christian media analyst Tricia Miller has demonsrated, it's only a very small number of Evangelical Christian Zionists who support Israel solely for 'prophetic reasons' or out of a motivation to 'hasten the second coming of Christ.' Whilst there are some Christians whose support for Israel is motivated by their desire to convert Jews to Christianity, the overwhelming majority love the state for biblical, theological and historical reasons that don't include attempts to convert Jews, or the desire to see Jews gathered in Israel to fulfill an interpretation of End Times events. Rather, modern Christian support for Israel is rooted in the historic Christian belief that Jews would some day return to their ancient homeland, an understanding of the historical and spiritual connection of the Jewish people to that land, and agreement with the right of Jews to self-determination in their land. Moreover, due in part to their sense of moral and theological duty, Christian Zionists are also overwhelmingly supportive of, and allied with, Jews in the diaspora as well, a philosemitic identity they see as distinct from other Christians who had persecuted Jews throughout the long history of their faith. Indeed, it strikes us as quite odd - not to mention self-defeating - that some who claim to be serious about fighting antisemitism would reject Christian allies merely out of concerns over the eschatological motivations of some of their adherents.HonestUnplugged : What Happened to News?HonestReporting is pleased to announce the launch of a new interview series - HonestUnplugged - which will cover topics ranging from defense and technology to culture and trends. In this first installment, CEO Daniel Pomerantz speaks with managing editor Charles Bybelezer about the current media landscape, specifically how ideological polarization in Israel and the US has seemingly influenced the manner in which news is produced and delivered in order to reinforce the pre-existing positions of a given target audience. Every episode will feature a well-known Israeli, who will provide an insider's look into the hot topics of the day.

The media have a responsibility to not blur the lines between terrorism and celebrity status. Play Video[36]BBC Arabic partly corrects references to Tel Aviv as the capital of Israel[37]Between July and November 2020 CAMERA Arabic submitted no fewer than ten complaints to the editors of the BBC Arabic website about its use of Tel Aviv as a refence to Israel or the Israeli government within the framework of the common journalistic practice of citing a nation's capital city as shorthand for the local government. In the past few weeks several corrections to this recurring falsehood have been made in BBC articles: four in Arabic and one in both Arabic and Spanish. That still leaves five Arabic language articles which have not been corrected to date. An identical correction was secured last August from the German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle, also in Arabic. That did not prevent the outlet from subsequently publishing several more inaccurate references to Tel Aviv as Israel's capital. In all the seven corrections (5 in BBC Arabic, one in BBC Spanish and one in DW Arabic) the phrase 'Tel Aviv' was replaced with either 'Israel' or 'the Israeli government'. The UK's BBC and Germany's DW thus joined - at least partially - the growing number of media outlets from various countries which have already agreed to admit the obvious: that Tel Aviv is not the capital of Israel. The other Arabic language ones among them are American stations CNN Arabic and Al-Hurra. English language outlets include Man convicted of promoting hatred towards Jews is sentenced for breach of probation in British Columbia, Canada[38]Arthur Topham has been sentenced to a 30-day conditional sentence plus three years probation, following a failure to comply with the terms of his previous probation period. The recent sentencing on 20th November comes after Mr Topham had been found guilty of breach of probation and a prior conviction in 2017 for wilfully promoting hatred against Jews. In November 2015, Mr Topham was convicted by a jury for calling for the forceful sterilisation of the Jews, claiming that the country is 'controlled by the Zionist Jewish lobby' and referring to Jewish places of worship as 'synagogues of Satan'. However, he launched a failed constitutional challenge to Canada's hate speech legislation, which subsequently delayed his sentencing until March 2017. Despite a possible maximum sentence of two years imprisonment, he received a six-month curfew and a ban on online engagement requiring him to abstain from posting any content related to the Jewish people for two years. Earlier this year, he proceeded to violate these terms by sharing antisemitic material and imagery. The conditions of his updated three-year probation period include a ban on posting any online content related to the Jewish people, the Jewish religion, Israel, Israelis and Zionism. B'nai Brith Canada has praised the sentencing decision and welcomed this as a reminder that there are consequences for such offensive actions against Jewish citizens. Australia primary school boy dresses up as concentration camp inmate[39]An elementary school in Melbourne, Australia, sparked controversy when one of its students dressed up as a concentration camp inmate for Book Week. Taking place in mid-November at St. John Vianney's Primary School, the student was dressed as the titular character in the Holocaust novel The Boy in the Striped Pajamas. His mother posted the picture on Facebook, writing later in a comment that the ""only thing letting his costume down is his blonder hair."" The incident sparked condemnation from Australia's leading civil rights organization, the Anti-Defamation Commission, who called on the school's principal Shane Regan to have the post removed, which it was, though Regan declined to comment. ""This is wrong on so many levels, and I am troubled by the level of insensitivity and ignorance displayed here,"" ADC chairman Dvir Abramovich said in a statement. ""I imagine that there would be many parents who would shake their heads in disbelief and find it hard to fathom why the mother sent her son to school as a concentration camp inmate, and later posted the images on social media,"" he said. ""Did she at any point consider the trauma this may cause to Jewish students who may have a Holocaust survivor grandparent, or that 1.5 million children were murdered in the Holocaust and that their death should not be the subject of a dress up? UAE's Al Dahra, Israel's Watergen sign strategic partnership on water security[40]Abu Dhabi-headquartered Al Dahra Agricultural Company and Israel's Watergen have signed a strategic partnership in the field of water security on Thursday. Al Dahra and Watergen agreed to establish a permanent centre in Abu Dhabi to produce and distribute machinery for producing water for drinking and irrigation in the region. ""The agreement aims to build a strategic partnership between the two sides to provide water from the air and add a renewable source of clean water suitable for human and agricultural consumption,"" Wam reported. The agreement was concluded after the UAE company delegation visited Israel in October 2020, following the peace accord between the UAE and Israel, to encourage cooperation and strategic partnerships between the two countries, Al Darei said, noting that the company's delegation met with representatives of Israeli companies operating in the sectors of agriculture, water and technology. Since the UAE and Israel agreed to establish formal ties in August, several agreements have been signed between companies in the two countries, particularly in the fields of technology and agriculture. During the visit, Al Dahra signed a Memorandum of Understanding, MoU, with Watergen covering an advanced technology for producing water from the air, while will help provide large quantities of drinking water, as well as water used in the irrigation of farms, parks, reserves, ranches and remote areas, he added. An AWG can produce up to 5,000 litres of water per day for drinking and irrigation purposes.

""I'm mad because people are trying to test my character and the person that I am and my integrity,"" the stock car circuit's only black full-time competitor told CNN's Don Lemon in an interview Tuesday night.
Earlier on Tuesday, the FBI said the noose that was found at Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama had been in that same garage since at least October 2019. The agency cited video evidence ""confirmed by NASCAR"" and noted that the company assigns garages the week before races.
""Although the noose is now known to have been in garage number 4 in 2019, nobody could have known Mr. Wallace would be assigned to garage number 4 last week,"" the FBI said in a statement.
The driver insists the rope was not a garage pull.
""It's a straight up noose,"" he told CNN. ""The FBI has stated it was a noose over and over again. NASCAR's leadership has stated it was a noose. I can confirm that I actually got evidence of what was hanging in my garage, over my car... that it was a noose. Never seen anything like it.""
Wallace also said it doesn't matter when the object was placed in the garage.
""It was a noose,"" he told the network. ""Whether tied in 2019 or whatever, it was a noose. So, it wasn't directed at me but somebody tied a noose. That's what I'm saying.""
The driver has also praised the FBI for conducting an investigation and treating the case seriously. In a tweet Wednesday, he said the outcome of the probe should not ""detract"" from the progress ""we've made as a sport"" so it's a welcoming environment to all.
""First off, I want to say how relieved I am that the investigation revealed that this wasn't what we feared it was,"" he wrote. ""I want to thank my team, NASCAR and the FBI for acting swiftly and treating this as a real threat. I think we'll gladly take a little embarrassment over what the alternatives could have been.""

Darrell Wallace Jr. said he was relieved to hear the F.B.I. say he had not been the target of a hate crime at Talladega Superspeedway last weekend, after a noose hanging in his garage stall was found to have been there since at least last fall. 
 In a statement on Twitter on Wednesday, Wallace, known as Bubba, thanked NASCAR and the F.B.I. for taking the threat seriously. ''We'll gladly take a little embarrassment over what the alternatives could have been,'' said Wallace, the sole black driver in NASCAR's top series.
 The national turmoil over race and serial injustice has complicated both Wallace's reaction and the public's response to the F.B.I.'s findings. With the government's investigation closed and no charges filed, Wallace has found himself all but forced to defend himself from baseless speculation that he or his supporters staged the incident to garner publicity.
 While NASCAR characterized the noose as a pull rope for a garage door that was ''fashioned like a noose,'' some people insisted the noose was just a rope with a handle, and that Wallace and stock-car racing executives had overreacted. Wallace said Wednesday on NBC's ''Today'' show that he considered the knot to be a noose that someone took time to create at the end of a door pull. Though the noose was not functional, he said, the sight of it ''makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up.''
 The debate over the episode was hardly deterred by the timeline of the case, the Justice Department's conclusions or the history of a sport that long has battled racism both inside and outside of the garage, including by fans who proudly flew the Confederate flag at competitions until Wallace called for NASCAR to ban it on June 8. NASCAR barred the battle flag two days later.
 Wallace wasn't the first person to notice the noose in his garage, or even the fourth. The accounts of Wallace and others within NASCAR indicated that he was at least the fifth person to be made aware of the noose after it was found on Sunday, and that he first learned about it from Steve Phelps, NASCAR's president.
 According to racing officials, a member of Wallace's crew noticed the suspicious rope and reported it to Jerry Baxter, the crew chief and a fixture of the sport. Baxter alerted Jay Fabian, a senior NASCAR official. Ultimately, Phelps met Wallace at the driver's motor home and tearfully told him what had been found.
 F.B.I. agents traveled to Talladega, less than an hour's drive from Birmingham, and began reviewing evidence. A crucial clue was an assertion on Monday morning by an employee of Wood Brothers Racing, another NASCAR team, that he had noticed the tied rope at a race last fall, long before Wallace had been assigned to the garage stall for this week's Geico 500.
 Through a spokeswoman, the United States attorney for the Northern District of Alabama, Jay E. Town, declined to be interviewed on Wednesday. But the Justice Department said Tuesday that officials were certain that the noose had been in the garage since at least October, and that ''nobody could have known Mr. Wallace would be assigned to garage No. 4'' that far in advance.
 ''The 43 team had nothing to do with this,'' Phelps said in a teleconference, referring to Wallace's Richard Petty Motorsports team. He said that NASCAR was still investigating who might have tied the noose last year, or perhaps even earlier.
 Hate crime hoaxes are extraordinarily rare. Just 11 of more than 7,000 reported hate crimes in 2018 turned out to be deliberately false reports, according to data compiled by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. But researchers said that when potential hate crimes, reported in good faith, are found not to have been plainly motivated by bias or malevolence, observers are often quick to react with skepticism -- and sometimes false arguments -- particularly online.
 ''We are now in a world today where conspiracy theories have greater currency than facts and patience,'' said Brian Levin, a former New York City police officer who is now the director of the San Bernardino center. ''This has become a game of gotcha rather than an earnest search for truth.''
 There was good reason for Wallace and his team to be sensitive to anything that could be perceived as racist. His own parents were concerned for his safety after he spoke out this month, saying the Confederate flag was a symbol of hate, and not heritage. Those safety concerns were focused on the reaction of fans in the predominantly white sport, but history has shown that racism also exists inside the stock-car circuit.
 In early 1999, David Scott, one of two black crew members in NASCAR, described in a news report that other crew members often called him names like Leroy and Lemont, and also called him racial slurs.
 ''I expected that coming here,'' Scott, who drove the motor home for a top owner, told The Orlando Sentinel. ''I just figure that's the way it is.''
 That harassment culminated with an incident in July 1999 at New Hampshire Motor Speedway, according to a lawsuit Scott filed against NASCAR in 2006. Two white employees of top NASCAR drivers showed up at the door of his motor home, and one had pulled a pillowcase over his head to impersonate a Ku Klux Klan member, the suit said. When Scott opened the door, the two men screamed.
 One of the men said, ''Hey, Scotty, we wanted to light the grass on fire so it would give it a better effect.'' About 10 other motor home drivers witnessed the incident and laughed, the lawsuit said. Scott feared for his life.
 ''What happened with Bubba is bringing back a lot of bad memories for both of us,'' Scott said on Wednesday, adding that his wife, Deirdre, worked for NASCAR in the licensing department until 2003. ''We've lost a lot of sleep over the last few days.''
 The two white men involved in the incident were fired, and NASCAR reminded teams that it had a zero-tolerance policy for racism. Scott's lawsuit in 2006 claimed that the association had not given him a job he had been promised, which was supposed to protect him from the harassment he had faced working for a team in the garage area. A judge dismissed the case in 2008, the same year NASCAR settled a separate lawsuit involving the first black woman to work as a NASCAR technical official.
 That official, Mauricia Grant, sued NASCAR for $225 million for racial discrimination, sexual harassment and wrongful termination. In her lawsuit, Grant, who went by the first name Mo, said she endured ''virulently racist comments'' and ''ugly racist bigotry'' by co-workers who called her names like ''Nappy Headed Mo,'' ''Mohammed'' and ''Simpleton.'' Some fellow officials discussed the Ku Klux Klan, she said, and it scared her. Her colleagues often made her work outside, the suit said, telling her that she would not sunburn because she was black, and would say she was ''on colored-people time'' if she was late.
 Grant, who didn't respond to messages, once rode in a car with another official at Talladega who told her to duck. According to court documents, he said, ''I don't want to start a riot when these fans see a black woman in my car.'' Another official at Talladega, according to the lawsuit, ''jokingly'' threatened to sic the garage's bomb-sniffing dog on Grant because she could be perceived as a criminal.
 While Wallace hasn't directly faced similar daily racism within NASCAR, he has acknowledged that whatever he does or says will be placed under a microscope and criticized by fans who might not want him to be in the sport. While enduring the backlash from the noose episode, he has had to remind himself that he can't please everybody.
 ''I will always have haters,'' Wallace said on CNN.

1978-1995 - Three people die and 23 others are wounded after a string of mail bombings carried out by Ted Kaczynski. ""The Unabomber,"" as he is also known, is serving eight life sentences for murder. He was not charged with terrorism, but the string of bombings is considered to be a terror case.
February 26, 1993 - A bomb explodes in the underground parking garage at the World Trade Center in New York. Six people are killed and more than 1,000 people are treated for injuries.

For #BlackJewishUnity Week, September 6-11, AJC and the National Urban League created resource lists to provide each community with films, articles, and books about the American Jewish and Black experiences, respectively.
Movies:
School Ties (1992)
This film is chock full of young but familiar faces Matt Damon, Brendan Fraser, Ben Affleck, and Chris O'Donnell. It may have been released more than 25 years ago, but it has taken on new significance in the 21st century with antisemitismthat is, hatred of Jewson the rise.
Fraser plays David Greene, a working-class Jewish teen from Scranton, Pennsylvania who wins a football scholarship to an elite prep school in his senior year. It soon becomes painfully clear that his new buddies don't like Jews, and Greene becomes the target of antisemitic attacks.
School Ties is set in the 1950s, but high schools and colleges have once again become a fertile ground for antisemitism. According to AJC's recent landmark survey of American Jews on this topic, young Jews are significantly more likely to have been victims of anti-Jewish hate. Nearly half of those between ages 18-29 said that they have been targeted by antisemitic remarks or have been physically attacked for being Jewish.
AJC offers LFT (Leaders For Tomorrow) to give high school students the tools to talk about the issues impacting Jews around the world today and the confidence to stand up for these issues in college and throughout their lives, no matter how difficult the circumstances.
The Chosen (1981)
Based on Chaim Potok's 1967 best-selling book, The Chosen portrays the friendship between two 15-year-old Jewish boys growing up in Brooklyn, New York, at the end of World War II. At a baseball game between their schools, Reuven Malter, a Modern Orthodox Jewish teenager, meets Danny Saunders, the son of a Hasidic Rebbe. At first, the meeting is one of enmity, but the teens gradually become friends, despite their differing backgrounds.
The Chosen retells one of the most dependable stories in literature, the story in which two people from different backgrounds overcome their mistrust and learn to accept each other's traditions. Set against the backdrop of World War II and the formation of the state of Israel, the film tackles many important questions about traditions, faith and beliefs.
Crossing Delancey (1988)
Crossing Delancey is a New York comedy about Isabella, or ""Izzy"" (played by Amy Irving), a Jewish woman from New York in her early 30s, who is caught in a romantic quandary when her grandmother hires a Jewish matchmaker to find her a husband. Much like Dirty Dancing, Crossing Delancey directed by Joan Micklin Silver and adapted from a play by Susan Sandler is a crowd-pleasing romance that involves a New York love triangle in which the heroine faces a choice between two very different men. One is Anton Maes (Jeroen Krabbe), a suave, successful European author who isit is largely implieda non-Jew. He wants to simultaneously seduce Izzy and hire her as his assistant. The other, introduced to her by neighborhood matchmaker Hannah Mandelbaum, is Sam ""The Pickle Man"" Posner (Peter Riegert), a Delancey Street pickle salesman who dotes on her and is very much Jewish.
Will Izzy go with the guy who represents fame, financial security, and respectability? Or will she choose the Jewish fellow, who offers none of those things but is charming and really likes her? We won't spoil the ending for you, but Crossing Delancey doubles as a bittersweet ode to the city's Lower East Side neighborhood, then still ethnically Jewish and full of little old Jewish mom-and-pop shops. It is also an outstanding travelogue of late 1980s New York City and a great look into the meaning of marriage, Jewish identity, and modernity.
Gentleman's Agreement (1947)
This black-and-white film tells the tale of a journalist who goes undercover as a Jew to research antisemitism in New York City and certain affluent Connecticut suburbs. Gregory Peck accepted the role as leading man against his agent's advice; Cary Grant already had turned it down.
The controversial film was a box office hit and won that year's Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director. But it also caught the attention of the House Un-American Activities Committee. Its director, producer, and two of its cast members were called to testify. The two cast members refused to cooperate and landed on the Hollywood blacklist as a result.
Though no reporters went undercover, the most recent piece of journalism documenting a surge of antisemitism and other dangerous bias in the U.S. has been Documenting Hate, a collaborative project over the last three years by ProPublica and 180 other newsrooms across the country. Journalists tracked underreported hate crimes and white supremacists, leading to arrests and proposed legislation to improve hate crime reporting.
The Frisco Kid (1979)
The Frisco Kid is a 1979 American western comedy film directed by Robert Aldrich, starring Gene Wilder and Harrison Ford. Rabbi Avram Belinski, played by Gene Wilder, leaves his native Poland to travel to San Francisco via Philadelphia to serve a fledgling Jewish community. An inexperienced and na¯ve traveler, Belinski falls in with three con men who trick him into helping pay for a wagon and supplies to go West and then brutally rob him and leave him and most of his belongings scattered along a deserted road in Pennsylvania. As he makes his way westward, he meets and befriends bank robber Tommy Lillard, played by Harrison Ford, who has never seen a rabbi before. What follows are many adventures and a story of friendship between two men who have seemingly nothing in common.
Documentaries:
Viral: Antisemitism in Four Mutations (2020)
In Viral: Antisemitism in Four Mutations, filmmaker Andrew Goldberg depicts how the latest wave of anti-Jewish hatred has been impossible to stop as it mutates, moves, and wreaks havoc across borders.
Goldberg travels through four countries France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Hungary to interview victims, antisemites, and leaders on the frontlines of the battle against the far right, far left, and radical Islamist instigators. The film features an appearance by AJC Europe Director Simone Rodan-Benzaquen, along with Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, a rebellious Holocaust survivor in Budapest, and others.
Hear Goldberg discuss his documentary on People of the Pod, AJC's weekly podcast.
Shared Legacies: The African American Jewish Civil Rights Alliance (2020)
Shared Legacies looks at the historic alliance between Blacks and Jews. It begins with the founding of the NAACP in 1909 and showcases the bigotry and segregation that both groups have faced. The documentary grapples with issues of systemic racism, many of which persist to this day, and pursues the aspiration of Dr. King to create a ""coalition of conscience.""
Pivotal events for both communities come alive through a treasure trove of archival materials, narrated by eyewitnesses, activists, Holocaust survivors, and leaders of the movement, including prominent figures such as Congressman John Lewis, Ambassador Andrew Young, Rabbi Alvin Sugarman, Rabbi Peter S. Berg, Oscar-winning actor Louis Gossett Jr., members of the King family, and many others. This inspiring story of unity, empathy, and partnership validates the ubiquity of the human experience, and how freedom and equality for all can be achieved only when people come together.
Articles:
David Harris, ""Confronting Antisemitism: Jews Need Trifocal Lenses"" (2017)
AJC CEO David Harris explains in this important essay that antisemitism is an epidemic that stems not from one single source, but rather from the hard left, the far right, and Islamic extremists. Harris contends that we should not allow ideological or partisan thinking to narrow the field of vision when it comes to antisemitism. Instead, he encourages readers to look at the whole picture.
While it is undeniable that acts of antisemitism like Charlottesville emanate from Neo-Nazis, the danger also comes from other sources, such as the hard left and Islamic extremists. As Harris points out, challenges to the Jewish people's national aspirations and constant singling out of Israel among 193 UN member states for delegitimization and disappearance are also a form of antisemitism. In the final section, Harris notes the most fatal attacks against Jews in Europe in recent years have been carried out by Islamic extremists.
Non-Fiction Books:
James McBride, The Color of Water (1995)
This fascinating, superbly written memoir was a New York Times bestseller for two years. To date it has sold more than 2.1 million copies worldwide and been translated into more than 16 languages.
It tells the story of James McBride and his White Jewish mother Ruth who came to America when she was a young girl in a family of Polish Jewish immigrants. She was the daughter of an itinerant rabbi and a loving, disabled mother who spoke no English. In 1941, at the age of 17, Ruth fled the South, landed in Harlem, and married Andrew Dennis McBride, a Black man from North Carolina. Ruth converted to Christianity and became very involved with church activities. The couple experienced a certain degree of prejudice as a result of their interracial marriage, but they opened the New Brown Memorial Church together in memory of Reverend Brown, their favorite preacher. They had several children, and eventually moved to accommodate their growing family. Enduring many hardships, Ruth was twice widowed and raised 12 children in New York City. Despite hardship, poverty, and suffering, she sent all 12 of her children to college.
In this memoir, James McBride weaves his own life story into his mother's story and discusses race, identity, religion, work, and moral beliefs.
Melissa Fay Greene, The Temple Bombing (1996)
In this book, award-winning author Melissa Fay Greene seeks the truth behind one of Atlanta's most despicable hate crimes. In 1958, white supremacists bombed the city's oldest Jewish synagogue, devastating and arousing deep fears in both the Jewish and African American communities, since its rabbi, Jacob Rothschild, was an outspoken advocate of integration. A trial of the accused terrorists ended in a hung jury, and a second trial in acquittal.
The Reform Jewish Temple became a rallying point uniting blacks and Jews in efforts for racial justice, and Rabbi Rothschildwho died in 1974 at the age of 62befriended Martin Luther King Jr., who in 1960 moved home to Atlanta, the scene of many critical confrontations in the early civil rights movement. Greene recreates these events in a spellbinding narrative written with fierce moral passion and a great sense of historic drama. By delving into the exclusionary policies and attitudes of Atlanta's white Protestant elite, tensions within the city's Jewish community, related terrorist incidents, and links among right-wing extremist, racist and antisemitic organizations, she has reclaimed a forgotten chapter of the civil rights era.
Elie Wiesel, Night (1960)
Written in 1960 by Nobel Peace Prize winner and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel, Night retraces Wiesel's experience with his father in the Nazi concentration camps of Auschwitz and Buchenwald in 1944-1945 with harrowing detail that truly brings the realities of the concentration camps to life.
In 1944, Wiesel, a Romanian-Hungarian Jew, and his family were deported to Auschwitz. There, he witnessed unthinkable acts: his mother and baby sister taken away to the gas chambers, children burned in the crematoria, a young boy hanged while the entire camp was forced to watch. Although he would survive, he would watch his father weaken during their forced labor, a death march through the snow, a bout of dysentery, and a beating by SS officers. Eventually, his father was taken to the crematorium. Three months later, the Allies liberated the camp where they were.
Night is a crucial book that is painful to read, but it has changed the way the world conceives of genocide by putting a face and a name to such terrible suffering. And it displays the beauty in the broken: the fact that Wiesel survived and got a chance to write. It also confronts existentialist questions about God and faith. Sadly, many of the issues of hatred, oppression, and genocide that Night raises remain relevant today.
Yossi Klein Halevi, Like Dreamers: The Story of the Israeli Paratroopers Who Reunited Jerusalem and Divided a Nation (2013)
Acclaimed journalist Yossi Klein Halevi, an American Jew who immigrated to Israel, interweaves the stories of a group of Israeli paratroopers who reunited Jerusalem during the Six-Day War, tracing the history of Israel and the divergent ideologies shaping it from 1967 to the present.
Following the lives of seven young members from the 55th Paratroopers Reserve Brigade, the unit responsible for restoring Jewish sovereignty to the Old City of Jerusalem, Halevi reveals how this band of brothers played pivotal roles in shaping Israel's destiny long after their historic victory. While they worked together to reunite their country in 1967, these men harbored drastically different visions for Israel's future. What the author manages to convey is not only Israel's reality and its problems, but also the lifelong connections of those who served in the Israeli army.
Fiction:
Dara Horn, The World to Come (2006)
In The World to Come, Dara Horn interweaves the story of a stolen painting with the story of a Jewish family, theology, and Yiddish literature. Her novel opens the door to ""the world to come""not life after death, but the world we create through our actions right now.
A million-dollar painting by Marc Chagall is stolen from a museum. The unlikely thief is Benjamin Ziskind, a former child prodigy who writes questions for a TV quiz show. As Benjamin and his twin sister try to evade the police, they find themselves recalling their dead parentsthe father who lost a leg in Vietnam, the mother who created children's booksand their stories about trust, loss, and betrayal.
What is true, what is fake, and what does it all mean? Eighty years before the theft, these questions haunted Chagall and the enigmatic Yiddish author Der Nister (""The Hidden One""), teachers at a school for Jewish orphans. Both the painting and the questions will travel through time to shape the Ziskinds' futures. Throughout this rich, complex and haunting novel, Horn reminds us that our world poses constant threats to the artist and to art, to the individual and the creative spirit.
For the Kids:
Sydney Taylor, All-of-a-Kind Family (1951)
All-of-a-Kind Family is a 1951 children's book by Sydney Taylor about a family of five American Jewish girls Ella, Henny, Sarah, Charlotte, and Gertie growing up on the Lower East Side of New York City in 1912.
Together they share adventures that find them searching for hidden buttons while dusting Mama's front parlor and visiting with the peddlers in Papa's shop on rainy days. The girls enjoy doing everything together, especially when it involves holidays and surprises. This book is especially great for kids ages 5-12!
An American Tail (1986)
This American animated adventure film was created in collaboration between Steven Spielberg, Don Bluth, and Universal Studios. Inspired in part by Spielberg's grandfather, this adorable film tells the story of Fievel Mouskewitz and his family as they immigrate from Russia to America for freedom. However, Fievel gets lost and must be reunited with his family in the vast city of New York, meeting friends and foes along the way."

That's not OK,' Imperatrice said. 'People can't be making shirts up, turning people against [cops]. It's going to cost somebody, more than likely a police officer, their life.'He reiterated how important it was to take down the shirts immediately to avoid putting police officers' lives at risk and to prevent the growing anti-cop mentality.The shirts were manufactured by the company COTINAC, the NY Post [3]reported, and were being sold on Amazon[4] for $19.99 plus shipping. Some reviews on the site's webpage described the shirt as 'disgusting' and said that it 'promotes, incites and glorifies hatred'.Amazon did not respond to a request for comments about the products.Since George Floyd's death, the widespread outrage caused several cases of police officers getting assaulted and demonstrations turning violent.'We've got to be smarter than this,' Imperatrice said. 'We have to be smarter than this rhetoric that police officers are all bad. [Officers are] taking abuse more than the likes of any generation.'

189,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_251/Files (250).DOCX","The Standard (Zimbabwe)",2020-06-14,"1192 words",NA,NA,NA,"The US on the verge of momentous changes",FALSE,"Letter from America:with KENNETH MUFUKA
In order to understand the present political turmoil in the American social fabric, one must keep as a background the fact that the US elites were shocked at the electoral victory of a street billionaire from New York for the presidency in November 2016.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said it aloud. They will get rid of President Donald Trump one way or another, sooner, rather than later.
When everything failed, the death of brother George Floyd, whose personal history was marred with five trips to a jailhouse, became the rallying cry for all men of goodwill and good sense.
The issue, as encapsulated by the Reverend Al Sharpton, is very simple. Revolutions always begin when grievances, long ignored, are illustrated by a single event which becomes the rallying point.
Despite all the liberating laws passed in favour of blacks, beginning with the Civil Rights Laws, 1964, the white establishment seems to have always been able to rally and regroup and impose more onerous conditions which brought blacks back to square one. The more they advanced, the more the system was able to recreate old Jim Crow.
Old Jim Crow was based on the idea that a black found away from his home after dark, was a target for police or vigilante brutality.
This explains why Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin, knowing full well that his choking of Floyd was being video-taped, and as bystanders shouted at him to heed Floyd's cries that ""I can't breathe"", he maintained the choke eight minutes and 46 seconds, even after Floyd was dead.
This explains why Ahmaud Arberry, who was jogging in his own upscale neighbourhood, was followed by three white men, two with hunting rifles and a third taking a video of the expected encounter. After shooting Arberry three times, Travis McMichael shouted to his videographer these words: ""I have shot the F…Nigger.""
McMichael and his two accomplices reported the incident to the police and were allowed to go home. One explanation is that the three, though they were armed with rifles, were afraid of Arberry who was jogging, dressed in jogging pants.
The revolution
While all white men of good character understood that blacks had a torrid time just ""breathing"", they felt that incidents were exaggerated by trouble-makers.
That is why gruesome video records of Arberry, Floyd and Eric Garner in New York are important. All reasonable white people are agreed, after seeing the videos, that blacks indeed have a case against the police. They are tormented between what they believe the US and what they see on the videos.
Speaking to the Oxford Union in 1968, James Baldwin said: ""It comes as a great shock that the country that you have pledged allegiance to has not evolved any place for you.""
The revolution is coming in the way white Americans are beginning to embrace Baldwin's pronouncement: ""I picked the cotton; I built the railroads, for nothing. Why is my right to live there a question now?""
Behind this great revolution is a desire to overthrow Trump from office, one way or another, sooner rather than later.
The Barak Obama coalition is rearing its head once more. Trump, in Sharpton's words, is the personification of evil in high places. Obama's desire to ""fundamentally transform America"" may be within reach.
Media stations and anchormen at Cable News Network (CNN) and National Broadcasting Corporation no longer report news without clearly stating their contempt of Trump. They have become spokespersons for the progressive party.
That is a shift in news broadcasting. CNN has gone further. It will no longer show Trump's addresses, except in edited version, calculated to show him at his worst.
The sheer size of the ""Resistance"" (an Obama word) is overwhelming. All across the US, including in my small town of Greenwood (100 000 population), streets have been filled, largely by multiracial crowds, with white protesters making up a majority.
Trump, as Sharpton has alleged, is the personification of ""cosmic powers (of) this present darkness, (representing) spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places"".
Trump, is considered a replica of the late Alabama governor George Wallace, who opposed Dr Martin Luther King at every turn.
The fundamental changes, already in the works, reflect the new ""truths"" taught at universities.
Laws against hate crimes will be enforced more vigorously than before. But, according to Trumpkins, hate speech includes derogatory references to gay life, which is part of the Christian faith.
Affirmative action, which has been abandoned, may be on its way back in support of African Americans excluded from certain jobs by institutional racism.
Universities, wanting to be ahead of the progressive curve, have already put in place programmes designed to protect minorities and gays.
The most fundamental change may be outlawing of hate speech. As we speak, William Bennett, senior editor at the New York Times (NYT), has been ""outed"" from his job for an error in judgement. He allowed Senator Tom Cotton, a Trumpkin, to write pro-Trump ""stuff"" on the editorial page of the Times. In the past, it was the NYT's custom to invite different views from world leaders, including Zimbabwe's President Emmerson Mnangagwa to be expressed therein.
New thinking says that wrongful ideas, such as Nazi ideologies, should never be given the light of day. Dennis Praga, a renowned conservative propagandist, complains that his books and articles are censored at Amazon and by the New York Times. One such write-up involved Ten Commandments. The mention of ""Thou shall not commit adultery"" was considered part of a hate programme against innocent hardworking sex workers.
Praga is also alleged to spew hatred against abortionists. Anti-abortion thinking is rooted in Catholic ideology, based on the sacredness of all human life.
This idea, if it interferes with a woman's right to do whatever she wants with her body, is considered medieval and patriarchal hegemonic tyranny.
The police hegemonies will soon fall under the sword. Minneapolis and New York City are leading in a campaign to defund these oppressive organs of state and replace police actions with social welfare outreach. It has been suggested that instead of sending a trooper to ""deal with a truant kid"" and probably ""throw him in a juvenile jailhouse"", it makes more sense if a loving and caring mother figure is assigned to the truant kid.
Twitter has given notice that it may, in future, refuse to carry Trump's tweets, as they are deemed to be spewing ignorance and hatred.
The revolutionaries are also keen on the appointment of gay judges who will enthusiastically embrace gay marriages. Trump is supposed to be on the other side of the issue.
While the revolutionaries know what they hate (police brutality), it appears as if they are walking in the dark, not knowing what to put in the place of the hated misogynist racist patriarchal hegemonic oppressive counterfeits.
One can surmise that evangelicals, who form the bedrock of Trumpkin support, are in a state of disorientation. If they support the revolution, they are engaging is self-immolation. If they don't, they are accused of being haters and racists."

Fordham University's decision in 2016 to reject a chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine because it could cause potential ""polarization"" on campus violated the student organizers' rights, a new amicus brief joined by PEN America argues.
Fordham has argued in Awad v. Fordham University that it is not subject to the First Amendment as a private institution and well within its right to bar Students for Justice in Palestine. A New York judge rejected that argument in August 2019. Now on appeal in the New York Appellate Division, PEN America argues that despite Fordham's private status, the university still guarantees freedom of speech in its own university policies, statements, and mission. As Fordham's policy on bias-related incidents and hate crimes carefully notes, ""the expression of an idea or point of view may be offensive or inflammatory to others"" may not be a pretext to prohibit such speech from seeing the light. In fact, like many other peer institutions, Fordham's mission statement ""guarantees the freedom of inquiry required by rigorous thinking and the quest for truth.""
""Private universities should be in the habit of upholding free speech, not finding ways around it,"" said Jonathan Friedman, program director for campus free speech at PEN America. ""Rules for the formation of student groups should be consistent and content-neutral, not bent because one groups' views are seen as objectionable by administrators.

A14","By MICHAEL BALSAMO, ALANNA DURKIN RICHER and COLLEEN LONG Associated Press  By MICHAEL BALSAMO,  ALANNA DURKIN RICHER  and COLLEEN LONG Associated Press",NA,"Justice Dept.: Sedition charge may apply to protest violence",FALSE,"WASHINGTON - In a memo to U.S. attorneys Thursday obtained by The Associated Press, the Justice Department emphasized that federal prosecutors should aggressively go after demonstrators who cause violence - and even sedition charges could potentially apply.
The sedition statute doesn't require proof of a plot to overthrow the government, the memo read. It instead could be used when a defendant tries to oppose the government's authority by force.
Attorney General William Barr has been pushing his U.S. attorneys to bring federal charges in protest-related violence whenever they can, keeping a grip on cases even if a defendant could be tried instead in state court. Federal convictions often result in longer prison sentences; sedition alone could lead to up to 20 years behind bars.
The memo cited as a hypothetical example ""a group has conspired to take a federal courthouse or other federal property by force,"" but the real thing took place in Portland, Oregon, during clashes that erupted night after night between law enforcement and demonstrators.
The Trump administration's crackdown on protest violence has already led to more than 300 arrests on federal crimes in the protests since the death of George Floyd. An AP analysis of the data shows that while many people are accused of violent crimes such as arson for hurling Molotov cocktails and burning police cars and assault for injuring law enforcement, others are not. That's led to criticism that at least some arrests are a politically motivated effort to stymie demonstrations.
""The speed at which this whole thing was moved from state court to federal court is stunning and unbelievable,"" said Charles Sunwabe, who represents an Erie, Pennsylvania, man accused of lighting a fire at a coffee shop after a May 30 protest. ""It's an attempt to intimidate these demonstrators and to silence them,"" he said.
Some cases are viewed as trumped-up and should not be in federal court, lawyers say, including a teenager accused of civil disorder for claiming online ""we are not each other's enemy, only enemy is 12,"" a reference to law enforcement.
The administration has seized on the demonstrations and an aggressive federal response to showcase what President Donald Trump says is his law-and-order prowess, claiming he is countering rising crime in cities run by Democrats. Trump has derided protesters and played up the violence around protests, though the majority of them are peaceful.
Pockets of violence have indeed popped up in Rochester, New York; Minneapolis, Washington, D.C., and Chicago. Federal officials were called to Kenosha, Wisconsin, after large protests and unrest following the shooting of Jacob Blake and the gunning down of two protesters and later arrest of a 17-year-old in their deaths. Notably, that teenager has not been charged with any federal crimes. Neither was a man accused of shooting and killing a demonstrator in Louisville following the death of Breonna Taylor.
While Barr has gone after protest-related violence targeted at law enforcement, he has argued there is seldom a reason to open sweeping investigations into the practices of police departments. The Justice Department, however, has initiated a number of civil rights investigations into individual cases. Barr has said he does not believe there is systemic racism in police departments, even though Black people are disproportionately more likely to be killed by police, and public attitudes over police reforms have shifted.
Federal involvement in local cases is nothing new. Officials across the country turn to the Justice Department for violent crime and gang cases where offenders could face much stiffer federal penalties and there is no parole.
Police chiefs in several cities have pointed to the importance of their relationships with federal prosecutors to bring charges that can result in long prison sentences to drive down violent crime.
Even before the unrest earlier this year, the Justice Department was stepping in to bring charges in states where the government believes justice is not being fully pursued by local prosecutors. In January, for example, the department brought federal hate crime charges against a woman accused of slapping three Orthodox Jewish women in one of several apparently anti-Semitic attacks reported throughout New York during Hanukkah.
It is not clear whether protest-related arrests will continue apace. Demonstrations have slowed, though not necessarily because of the federal charges. Wildfires in the West and hurricanes in the South have lessened some of the conflict."

Nita Lowey:
Congresswoman Lowey (D-NY17/Rockland-Westchester), Chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, and the Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee, today approved by voice vote the Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 Homeland Security funding bill. The $50.72 billion proposal includes $10.8 billion for Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and $3.66 billion for Federal Assistance, which includes funding for the Urban Areas Security Initiative (UASI) Nonprofit Security Grants and the newer non-UASI Nonprofit Security Grants within the State Homeland Security Grant Program (NSGP-S) that Chairwoman Lowey created in FY 2018. The increases of $473.9 million above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $1.18 billion above the President's budget request for Federal Assistance include record-level funding for the nonprofit security grants.
""In response to the rise in anti-Semitic incidents and violent hate crimes, our draft bill quadruples funds for nonprofits and religious institutions to help prevent and protect against terrorism and targeted, violent extremism,"" said Congresswoman Lowey. ""The record funding for nonprofit security grants in both UASI and non-UASI regions would enable the Westchester, Rockland, and the broader New York nonprofit community to protect themselves with increased security measures and greater peace of mind so that they can gather safely. It brings me great pride to know that a program I created is helping to keep children and families safe and secure across the Lower Hudson Valley. As the appropriations process continues, I will keep fighting to bring home increased funding for New York.""
Combined funding for nonprofit security grants in both UASI (NSGP-U) and non-UASI regions (NSGP-S) was $90 million in FY 2020. The House Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee approved a combined funding level of $360 million in the FY 2021 bill, which would be an increase of $270 million, or a quadrupling of funding, for nonprofit security grants. Individually, NSGP-S would receive a record $180 million in FY 2021, marking a $140 million increase from $40 million in FY 2020. The NSGP-U would receive a record $180 million in FY 2021, which would be a $130 million increase from $50 million in FY 2020. The bill is expected to be considered by the full Appropriations Committee in the coming days.
In FY 2018, Congresswoman Lowey successfully created the Nonprofit Security Grant Program carve-out within the State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP) to support nonprofit organizations located outside of UASI-designated urban areas, such as Rockland County. The new program was originally funded at $10 million in FY 2018. As Chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, Congresswoman Lowey was instrumental in securing an increase of $30 million in FY 2020 to support nonprofit security. Last week, the Congresswoman announced that at least 25 organizations in the 17th Congressional District will receive a total of $2,565,028 of those federal funds."

All she wanted to do was talk about violent ""Democrat run"" cities, and those mean reporters just kept asking her about stuff the president actually controls. Like his own Twitter account and the federal pandemic response. Unfair!
 She started off strong, with a sideswipe at Trump's critics by citing his ""two defining, unifying, and patriotic speeches, which drew widespread praise by those who cherish our values, honor our history, and seek to advance policies that lift up all Americans."" Did you think his speeches were racist dreck? Why do you hate America? Then she made some noises about the statues and accused the media of doing culture war crimes: ""This vision is not a culture war, as the media seeks to falsely proclaim; it's an embrace of our American family, our values, our freedom, and our future."" But then it was question time, and those assholes in the White House press corps didn't want to just give her more opportunities to praise Trump's godlike awesomeness. They didn't ask about Black on Black crime or why Democrats want to celebrate Independence Day by wrapping statues of Lincoln in the American flag and setting them on fire. No, they just wanted to talk about the Bubba Wallace tweet and the Confederate flag. Ugh, rude! The first reporter asked why her boss is ""so supportive of flying the Confederate flag?""[1] Has @BubbaWallace apologized to all of those great NASCAR drivers &#38; officials who came to his aid, stood by his sid https://t.co /XGPapgYIAA — Donald J. Trump (@Donald J. Trump)1594038787.0[2] ""Well, I think you're mischaracterizing the tweet,"" she huffed. ""The tweet was aimed at pointing out that the FBI report of the alleged hate crime at NASCAR concluded that the garage door pull, which had been there since last fall, was obviously not targeted at a specific individual because, in fact, it was a garage pull and, in fact, it was there since last fall, long before these 43 teams arrived. And it was concluded by the FBI that this was, quote, 'not an intentional racist act.'"" Not a noose?Image via NASCAR When pressed why the president said incorrectly[3] that NASCAR ratings were down because they banned the Confederate flag, McEnany chided the reporter for ""taking his tweet completely out of context,"" by which she meant quoting the president's words and not the magical spin they cooked up afterwards in the panic room cum comms center at the White House. See, when Trump asked why Bubba Wallace hadn't ""apologized to all of those great NASCAR drivers &#38; officials who came to his aid, stood by his side, &#38; were willing to sacrifice everything for him, only to find out that the whole thing was just another HOAX,"" what he meant was, why is the media racist against NASCAR fans. Obviously! ""At the very end, the ban on the flag was mentioned in the broader context of the fact that he rejects this notion that somehow NASCAR men and women who go to these sporting events are racist,"" McEnany insisted. ""When, in fact, as it turns out, what we saw with the FBI report and the alleged incident of a hate crime — it was a complete indictment of the media's rush to judgment once again, calling this a hate crime when the FBI completely dismissed that."" Luckily someone jumped in with a coronavirus question, giving the press secretary a golden opportunity to brag about the millions of Americans who catch COVID and don't even die thanks to ""the great work of this administration with therapeutics and remdesivir and dexamethasone."" But then it was back to NASCAR and the damn flag. GRRRR. If those nasty reporters refused to be fobbed off with vague assertions that Trump was ""not making a judgment one way or the other"" when he yelled at NASCAR for banning the Confederate flag, then she'd have to pull out the big guns. The intent of the tweet was to stand up for the men and women of NASCAR and the fans and those who have gone, and this rush to judgment of the media to call something a hate crime when, in fact, the FBI report concluded this was not an intentional racist act. And it very much mirrors other times when there have been a rush to judgment, let's say with the Covington boys or with Jussie Smollett. Jussie Smollett. DRINK! Why is it the responsibility of NASCAR's sole black driver to apologize since he neither found the noose AHEM DOOR PULL, nor made any accusations about hate crimes? Well, look, the FBI, as I noted, concluded that this was not a hate crime, and he believes it'd go a long way if Bubba came out and acknowledged that as well. Which is not an explanation for the demanded apology. But anyway, ummm, Jussie Smollett? He believes the American people are good. And the allegations and the rush to judgement with Jussie Smollett and the Bubba Wallace case and with the Covington Catholic boys, we shouldn't be so quick to jump onto those narratives. Those are just three examples of those that have been proven false. Make mine a double, bartender. I've explained to you — this is, I guess, the fourth attempt, but we'll try it again — in aggregate, what he was pointing out is this rush to judgment to immediately say that there is a hate crime, as happened in this case, as happened with Jussie Smollett, as happened with the Covington Catholic boys. In an aggregate, those actions made it seem like NASCAR men and women were racist individuals who were roving around and engaging in a hate crime. Cripes, we'll all be hammered before lunch at this rate. Also, there's no better way to show you're one with the people than to refer to them as ""NASCAR men and women."" Why should Wallace apologize? ""I'm not going to answer a question a sixth time."" GOT IT. Anyway, why isn't the president willing to condemn the Confederate flag when even Mississippi has voted to take it down? It's really quite appalling what we've seen happen across the country, and the President wants no part in cancel culture. He wants to no part in the tearing down and defacing of Matthias Baldwin, an abolitionist; Philadelphia Civil War soldiers; John Greenleaf Whittier vandalized, an abolitionist. He wants no part in this, and he stands against the demonization of Americans, and he stands firmly on the side of preserving our history. Ohhhhhh, cancel culture. Well, that clears it up. Hey, if you don't want to talk about flags, how about another COVID question, since the UK and Canada are still building a wall to keep us germy Americans out. I think the world is looking at us as a leader in COVID-19 ... In deaths and cases, yes.... because the chart I showed you, where you have mortality rate — and Italy and UK up here and across Europe, and you have the United States at a low case mortality rate — it's because of the extraordinary work that we've done on therapeutics and getting PPE and leading on ventilators and having excess ventilators that we were able to deploy around the world and help other countries. So that's what I would have to say on COVID. UH HUH. COVID fatality rate of countries currently most affectedvia Johns Hopkins[4] Excellent. Want to flounce off with another jab at black cities?

194,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_251/Files (250).DOCX","CNN Wire",2020-07-08,"479 words",NA,NA,NA,"San Francisco official proposes 'CAREN Act,' making racially biased 911 calls illegal",FALSE," (CNN) -- It may soon be illegal to make discriminatory, racially biased 911 calls in San Francisco.
The ""CAREN Act"" (Caution Against Racially Exploitative Non-Emergencies) was introduced on Tuesday at a San Francisco Board of Supervisors meeting by Supervisor Shamann Walton.
The ordinance's name is a twist on ""Karen,"" the name social media gives people making racially biased 911 calls. 
And it's not just ""Karen."" There are also names like ""Becky,"" which has also come to symbolize a stereotype of whiteness. And ""Susan."" And ""Chad.""
The ordinance is similar to the statewide AB 1550 bill introduced by California Assemblyman Rob Bonta, making it unlawful and accountable for a caller to ""fabricate false racially biased emergency reports."".
""Using 911 as a tool for your prejudice towards marginalized communities is unjust and wrong!"" Bonta tweeted. 
Racially motivated 911 calls aren't a new occurrence across the country, in spite of a recent uptick following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man killed in police custody in Minneapolis.
Just a few weeks ago, a White hotel employee in North Carolina called the police on a guest, a Black woman and her children, who were using the hotel's swimming pool. And in May, a White woman called 911 on a Black man who was birdwatching in New York's Central Park. 
Bonta said the intent of AB 1550 isn't to discourage Californians in real danger from calling 911.
""This bill could protect millions of Californians from becoming targets of hate and prevent the weaponization of our law enforcement against communities of color,"" he said in an online release. 
""Racist false reports put people in danger and waste resources,"" the ordinance's co-author, Supervisor Matt Haney, tweeted. 
Though making a false police report is a misdemeanor or felony offense in many states, including California, accountability is lacking for making racially biased calls to law enforcement.
Other cities have already begun the process to pass similar legislation.
Los Angeles City Councilman Curren Price introduced a similar motion to the City Council in June exploring ""criminal penalties, rights of victims to bring private civil actions and cost recovery by the City,"" he tweeted.
In 2019, the City Commission in Grand Rapids, Michigan, held a public hearing on a ""proposed human rights ordinance"" criminalizing racially motivated calls to 911 with a fine of up to $500. 
In 2018, former New York state Sen. Jesse Hamilton proposed a bill after a woman called 911 on him for campaigning, that would require the local district attorney to investigate these incidents as hate crimes. If the calls were deemed racially motivated, a number of consequences such as fines, sensitivity training or jail time would be issued.

like New York City. So Haruka, that happened to you, and then you start asking around and realise this isn't an isolated incident? Right, so I started to realise that there was a pattern of these incidents and I started to do some research, I found several Facebook groups where Asian-Americans were self-reporting incidents of racial aggression via text and video, and I also came across some advocacy organisations like Chinese for Affirmative Action that compiled a virtual map of aggravated incident reports from Asian-Americans who had experienced racial aggressions across the US, and this virtual map already included up to 1,000 cases by the time I was conducting the research, but that number currently surpasses 1,500. Interestingly enough, the NYPD hate crimes statistics summary at this point included only one report of a hate crime directed towards Asians at this point, so as you can imagine, the numbers weren't really adding up and I was shocked to hear the statistics, to be honest. 
our experiences would be confined to these online spaces and never be taken seriously unless we did the documenting ourselves. So let's look at some of the documenting. I know you've got a whole series of case studies. If we take a couple - Justin, for example. all these sicknesses,"" and told him is one of many incidents that he had experienced, you know, while commuting daily to the hospital where he worked as a nurse. So essentially he's, you know, being exposed to all of this harassment while he is in scrubs on public transportation, right? And ironically, Justin also had experienced more harassment than perhaps the rest of us because he had made the conscientious choice to wake up every morning during this pandemic and to protect his community out on the front lines as an essential worker. And I think with other cases, there are examples of different kinds of prejudice or discrimination kind of layering themselves on top of one another. Ida Chen, for example. Right, so Ida Chen's story actually resonated with me the most. She was catcalled by a man who said something to the effect of, ""I would be into you if you didn't carry the virus."" Racial insults directed at Asian women are often quite nuanced. Sp we hear that men only want to date us because they have an Asian fetish, to more verbally explicit forms, like what Ida had experienced. And from my own personal experience, you know, it can be especially difficult to respond in these types of circumstances, because Asian-American women - we tend to experience these harder forms of microaggression on a regular basis, to the point where some of us may have internalised these"

Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R 5317) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 315 Addicks Howell Road in Houston, Texas, as the ``Deputy Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal Post Office Building''. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R 5317 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. DEPUTY SANDEEP SINGH DHALIWAL POST OFFICE BUILDING. (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal Service located at 315 Addicks Howell Road in Houston, Texas, shall be known and designated as the ``Deputy Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal Post Office Building''. (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the ``Deputy Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal Post Office Building''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cloud) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York. General Leave Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this measure. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from New York? There was no objection. Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of H.R 5317, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 315 Addicks Howell Road in Houston, Texas, as the Deputy Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal Post Office Building. Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal was born in Punjab, India, before his parents decided to emigrate to Houston, Texas. Before joining the Harris County Sheriff's Office, Deputy Dhaliwal owned a successful trucking business. It was his sense of duty and a desire to build a bridge between the department and the Houston area Sikh community that compelled him to join the Sheriff's office. He joined the force as a detention officer in 2009 and was later deputized and graduated to the rank of patrol deputy. He was assigned to northwest Harris County where he would stay for the rest of his career. Deputy Dhaliwal was the first observant Sikh to serve in the Harris County Sheriff's Office and was one of the first observant Sikhs in Texas to receive an accommodation to observe his religion while serving as a police officer. He served with distinction and was a shining example of the important contributions that religious minorities make to our country. Deputy Dhaliwal also spent countless hours volunteering for Sikh communities across the Nation. Tragically, he was shot and killed while conducting a routine traffic stop. He was only 42 years old and is survived by his wife and three children. Naming a post office in his honor is a fitting tribute to a man who served selflessly, made the ultimate sacrifice for his community, and left this country a better place. I would like to thank the honorable Member from Texas, Representative [[Page H4357]] Fletcher, for this legislation to honor a dedicated public servant and trailblazer for the rights of religious minorities. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R 5317 which would name a post office in my home State of Texas after Deputy Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal. Dhaliwal joined the Harris County Sheriff's Office out of a sense of duty and a desire to build a bridge between the department and the Houston area Sikh community. He was also one of the first observant Sikhs in Texas to receive a policy accommodation allowing him to wear the turban and beard associated with the Sikh religion during his service as a police officer. After being promoted to the rank of patrol deputy, he was assigned to northwest Harris County. In September of 2019, Dhaliwal was shot and killed from behind during a routine traffic stop leaving behind a wife and three daughters. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation honoring a local law enforcement hero, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the distinguished gentlewoman from the great State of Texas (Mrs. Fletcher). I congratulate my friend on this bill. Mrs. FLETCHER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Maloney for all of her efforts to bring this important bill to the floor of this House. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Deputy Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal. He was my constituent, and he was killed in the line of duty nearly a year ago today on September 27, 2019. As we reach this sad anniversary for our community, I am grateful that this bill to pay tribute to Deputy Dhaliwal's lasting impact on our community is on the floor of the House today. This legislation will designate the postal facility on Addicks Howell Road in Texas' Seventh Congressional District as the Deputy Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal Post Office Building. Deputy Dhaliwal was widely regarded as a role model for Americans of all faiths wishing to serve their communities. He was the first observant Sikh to serve in the Harris County Sheriff's Office, and he was also one of the first officers in Texas to receive a policy accommodation to practice his religion while serving as a police officer. As my colleagues have noted, he was born in Punjab, India, but his parents soon decided to emigrate to Houston where Mr. Dhaliwal grew deep roots. He did have a successful business, but seeking to build a bridge between law enforcement and the Sikh community and the greater Houston community, he joined the Harris County Sheriff's Office, first as a detention officer in 2009 and one year later he was deputized and graduated to the rank of patrol deputy. He was assigned to district 5 which covers much of northwest Harris County, an area he would patrol for the rest of his career. Through his years of service, he improved law enforcement's cultural understanding of Sikhs and was an outstanding example of the tireless contributions that religious minorities and marginalized communities make to our country. Deputy Dhaliwal was also known to have a giving heart, coordinating relief efforts after Hurricane Harvey and traveling to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria to help a colleague's relatives. He volunteered countless hours for Sikh communities across the Nation serving as the director of homeland security for United Sikhs, helping to advise Sikh communities on dealing with potential hate crime threats, and advocating for their religious rights. Deputy Dhaliwal is survived by his wife and three young children. He represented the very best of our community. He worked for equality, connection, and community through his life of service to others. The senseless slaying of Deputy Dhaliwal is a solemn reminder of the risks assumed by police officers daily in serving and protecting our communities. Renaming this post office facility in his honor will serve as a permanent reminder of Deputy Dhaliwal's commitment to and sacrifice for the community that he lived in and served. It will show that we stand in solidarity with the people of Houston, of Harris County, and the Sikh community across the country as they celebrate the life and mourn of loss of this remarkable and selfless hero. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Maloney for her support of this important bill, I thank my colleagues in Texas for joining me unanimously in bringing it forward as cosponsors, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' in favor of the bill. Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R 5317, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R 5317. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table."

Officers responded to the report of vandalism at Katie and Robbie Peacock's home near Lafayette Circle in Lafayette on Tuesday, ABC7 reported.
The couple have a Joe Biden flag flying outside their residence as well as a sign expressing their opposition to President Donald Trump, according to the station.
The Lafayette Police Department is investigating the vandalism as a ""possible hate crime"" and has alerted the FBI, Lafayette mayor Mike Anderson said.
Similar graffiti was painted on an overpass in nearby Orinda in recent days. According to ABC7, it said ""swastika equals Trump equals ACB equals swastika.""
That graffiti as well as what was painted on the Peacock's garage door have since been painted over.
But the Peacocks said that it served to highlight how important it is for people to vote in the November 3 election.
""Let this message of hate and violence underscore the importance of how we all show up in this moment,"" they said in a statement to ABC7.
Voters have only days, they said, to ""choose love over hate, unity over division, and bravery over fear.""
""Together, we can do this—and we will,"" they added.
Katie Peacock also posted about the incident on Facebook, writing that she hoped the ""horrendous"" event would unite people against hate, oppression and racism, the Los Angeles Times reported.
Of the perpetrators, she added: ""Regardless of the zip code they reside in, they are obviously not of my community. Community is so much more [than] that. Community is in your head and heart."" She could not immediately be reached for additional comment.
Lindy Rice, who said she was a friend of the couple, said on Facebook that she believes their home was targeted because of the Biden flag on display.
""This is the kind of behavior flourishing under Trump. The one thing the vandals got right was linking Trump's name to the swastika,"" she wrote. Rice has been contacted for additional comment.
In his statement, Anderson said those responsible for the vandalism would be ""vigorously prosecuted.""
""There is no place for hate in Lafayette,"" Anderson said, according to the Times. ""This is an inclusive and diverse city where everyone is welcome. The spray-painting of a swastika, a symbol of oppression, genocide, and xenophobia, on an individual's home will not be tolerated.
""Lafayette stands together in the face of any act involving prejudice or racism; this act will not be overlooked and will be vigorously prosecuted.""
Seth Brysk, the regional director of the Anti-Defamation League also condemned the graffiti, telling KTVU: ""The issue here is that you have the normalization of an extremist symbol, one which has proven to be deadly.""
Anderson, the Lafayette Police Department and the FBI have been contacted for additional comment.
Anyone with information about thee incident is urged to contact detectives at 925-383-3680.

The Police Insist It Wasn’t About Race.",FALSE,"One of the two white suspects has far-right ties. The prosecutor in the case called it “a personal relationship that has gone wrong.”
A young Black man was tortured and killed on a remote island in Denmark by two white men, one of them with far-right affiliations and a swastika tattoo on his leg, but the authorities are refusing to call it a hate crime.
Noting that the victim, Phillip Mbuji Johansen, and his attackers knew one another, the prosecutor, Benthe Pedersen Lund, told a local newspaper that the killing had nothing to do with “skin color” but with “a personal relationship that has gone wrong.”
Denmark adopted a hate crimes statute in 2004, but activists, friends and family members, citing the grisly circumstances of the killing, say the authorities are often too reluctant to acknowledge racially inspired violence.
“It took three days for the police inspector and state prosecutor to completely refute that it is racially motivated, despite all the evidence pointing toward it,” said Awa Konaté, a Danish-Ivorian activist who teaches African cultural awareness. “This shows this is a systemic issue.”
Mr. Johansen (he sometimes identified as Mbuji Johansen), a 28-year-old engineering student of Danish and Tanzanian descent, came to the island of Bornholm to visit his mother last week. He went to a party on Monday and was later invited for a beer in the woods, his mother told the local Ekstra Bladet newspaper.
The next morning, Mr. Johansen’s mutilated body was found at a camp site. According to the preliminary indictment, his skull was broken after he was beaten several times with a wooden beam; he was stabbed multiple times; a knife was driven through his throat and a knee had been planted in his neck. He died sometime early Tuesday, according to a forensic report.
Two local men — brothers, aged 23 and 25 — were arrested on Wednesday on manslaughter charges. The police say the men have admitted to beating Mr. Johansen, but deny killing him. Mr. Johansen’s mother, who asked to remain anonymous, told local news outlets that one of the two suspects was an old friend of her son.
The suspects have not yet been identified publicly. The one with the swastika also has the words “white power” tattooed on his leg and has expressed support for a Danish extreme right party, called Stram Kurs, or “Hard Line,” and recently posted a message of support for White Lives Matter on his Facebook page, according to Redox, a left-activist research group.
The other suspect’s lawyer, Asser Gregersen, said his client had no association with right-wing groups. “My client has no sympathies or affiliation with any political party,” Mr. Gregersen said, “nor has he expressed any sympathies for racist or right-wing agendas.”
Denmark, a Nordic nation that prides itself on its progressive attitudes, has suffered an upsurge in racial violence recently. Between 2007 and 2016, racially motivated hate crimes in Denmark more than quadrupled, the European Union said in a 2018 report.
In response to the global protests over the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, right-wing extremists of the Nordic Resistance Movement, an underground group, have put up White Lives Matter posters in at least two cities in Denmark.
Some Danish news outlets have noted that a knee was pressed hard against Mr. Johansen’s neck, just as in the killing of Mr. Floyd, as well as the hard-right affiliation of one of the suspects. The story has nevertheless mostly been treated as a “homicide” and has received only modest news coverage.
Danish police and judicial officials have gone out of their way to disavow any connection between the killings of Mr. Floyd and Mr. Johansen or, for that matter, that race was a factor.
Daniel Villaindulu, a close family friend, strongly disagreed. “He was tortured for hours,” Mr. Villaindulu said, noting that he and Mr. Johansen were among the few Black people on the island of Bornholm.
“They say there was jealousy over something,” he said in a telephone interview, “but when you add everything up and you know these guys had a swastika tattoo and are right wingers, you can image why it ended like this.”
Another family friend, Tobias Krahmer, told local news outlets that he thought the killing was not racially motivated. But activists say Mr. Krahmer, who is white, ripped down a “Black Lives Matter” banner outside the Bornholm courthouse on Friday.
“You can’t compare what is happening in the U.S. to this horrible crime on Bornholm,” Mr. Krahmer told a local television network, TV2. “It’s all different. Do not pull the racism card and start a heated debate about this being a hate crime.”
Local activists see a pattern of denial in Denmark when it comes to racially motivated crimes, some of which they attribute to rising anti-immigrant attitudes. In one prominent case in 2017, the police ruled out race as a factor when a 16-year-old Afghan boy was set on fire by four schoolmates.
In 2018, a center-right government introduced the “ghetto law,” which allowed courts to double punishments for certain crimes against residents of 25 deprived, heavily Muslim neighborhoods that were classified as ghettos, based on residents’ income, employment status, education levels, number of criminal convictions and “non-Western background.”
Another measure imposes a four-year prison sentence on immigrant parents who force their children to make extended visits to their country of origin — described as “re-education trips” — that could discourage their assimilation by damaging their “schooling, language and well-being.”
“Conversations about racism exist often on the periphery through conversations by activists and community organizers — rarely by politicians or public figures,” said Ms. Konaté, the activist. “The extent of racism in Denmark is absolute denial of its existence. Although there is so much evidence pointing to the murder being racially motivated, the police, the prosecutor and even the victim’s friend, who is white, deny any connection.”
Mr. Johansen had almost finished his studies and had recently moved to Roskilde, a Danish city that is host to a major annual rock festival. On his Facebook page, he shared images of Bornholm, and his posts showed his love for engineering and nature. The header of his page reads: “Be the change you wish to see in the world.”

""N------don't belong on this beach,"" Lee James Mouat yelled at the boys, who are black, on 6 June, according to a criminal complaint released this week.
Mr Mouat, 42, then grabbed a bike lock and struck Mr Freelon, 18, in the face, said several witnesses. The blow knocked out several of Mr Freelon's teeth and shattered his jaw.
Federal prosecutors charged Mr Mouat on Tuesday with a hate crime for ""willfully causing bodily injury to an African-American teenager because of the teenager's race"". If convicted, Mr Mouat faces up to 10 years in prison.
The case is the latest hate-crime charge filed by federal prosecutors this year against white suspects accused of attacking black people in racially-charged assaults. Federal prosecutors charged a man in September for allegedly stabbing a black man in Oregon, unprovoked, several times in last December. A woman in Queens, New York, who is accused of throwing a glass bottle at a black woman who was jogging and yelling ""go back to Africa"" in August, also received hate-crime charges last month.
At least four people witnessed the alleged assault in Michigan, according to the criminal complaint written by Sean D. Nicol, a special agent with the FBI's Detroit Division in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
It was the evening of 6 June, and Mr Freelon and his two friends had been walking in William C. Sterling State Park, a public park with a lakeside beach about 35 miles south of Detroit, and listening to music on a portable speaker.
Two witness told the investigator that they heard a white man, later identified by police as Mr Mouat, loudly complaining about the music, calling the boys the n-word and ""monsters"".
""These n------are playing gang music,"" Mr Mouat said, according to one of the witnesses. ""I want to hit them with this cooler."" He also said: ""I wish someone would say something to me so I can beat them.""
The second witness observed Mr Mouat, who was walking with his family, approach the boys in the parking lot. The witness heard the man threaten to ""bash their heads in if they don't turn [their music] down"", he told the investigator.
""Black lives don't matter,"" Mr Mouat said.
One of Mr Freelon's friends, who is also cited as a witness in the criminal complaint, responded to Mr Mouat's aggressive comments.
""We'll kick your a--,"" Mr Freelon's friend said.
Mr Mouat then began walking away and said, ""I've got something for you in my car"".
At that point, Mr Freelon's friend thought the man was leaving with his family, he told the investigator. But a fourth witness saw Mr Mouat walk to a nearby minivan, uttering, ""I'll show you!"" and then retrieve a chain bike lock.
Simultaneously, Mr Freelon separated from his friends and started walking toward his car. Mr Mouat then yelled, ""Hey"", to get Mr Freelon's attention and promptly swung the lock at his face, striking his jaw and causing him to fall to the ground. Mr Mouat swung the object again, but missed, according to a witness. Moments later, police arrived.
A lawyer for Mr Mouat did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Mr Freelon was taken to the hospital by an ambulance, and many in the community rallied around him. Mr Freelon's cousin Kiara Phillips created a GoFundMe that raised more than $18,000, and a local dentist fixed Mr Freelon's teeth for free. Demonstrators holding ""Justice for Devin"" signs gathered outside the county courthouse on 9 June, the day Mr Mouat was arraigned, the Ionia Sentinel-Standard reported.
Ms Phillips said the incident happened days before Mr Freelon graduated from high school.
""This year has already taken a lot from him as a senior and as an African American, with the tension going on in America currently. It's a shame the hate in this world has taken another thing from him,"" Ms Phillips said.

* * *
Catholic League president Bill Donohue comments on reaction to vandalized Black Lives Matter (BLM) banners:
The media and left-wing activists never expressed anger when Catholic churches and iconic Catholic statues were being vandalized and destroyed by Antifa and Black Lives Matter, but now--all of a sudden--they are up in arms over BLM banners being burned outside black churches in Washington D.C. Their selective outrage is stunning.
On December 15, the Associated Press (AP) ran a big piece on the BLM banners. It claimed that black churches were vandalized. They were not. It was BLM banners displayed outside the churches that were burned: The churches themselves were not damaged in any way. By contrast, to cite one example, last spring BLM supporters spray-painted obscenities on the exterior wall of New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral. Yet there was no comparable outcry from those upset about BLM banners being burned.
To its credit, AP proved to be the most fair of any media outlet. It not only covered the BLM banners that were vandalized, it covered the several instances this year when statues of St. Junipero Serra were toppled by left-wing activists. Unfortunately, it was an anomaly among the big media. The New York Times and the Washington Post covered the BLM incident but had no news story on the multiple Serra incidents.
The burning of BLM banners was cited by CBS, CNN, Fox News, MSNBC and PBS. Only CBS mentioned the destruction of statues of St. Serra. Moreover, the attack on this heroic priest extended over several months in many cities; it was not just one weekend of violence.
It is not just the smashing of statues of St. Serra that Catholics have endured this year.
In June, the Catholic Basilica of St. Mary in Minneapolis was set on fire. Catholic churches near the University of Mississippi were vandalized. The Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate Conception in Denver was trashed. Windows were smashed in Dallas at St. Jude Chapel and at the Cathedral of the Assumption in Louisville. Swastikas and anti-Catholic scribbling was found on the graves of several Dominican friars on the campus of Providence College.
In July, a statue of Our Blessed Mother was set on fire in Boston and another statue of the Virgin Mary was vandalized in Queens. In Ocala, Florida, a man crashed his minivan into a Catholic church while parishioners gathered for Mass; he then poured gasoline in the church's foyer and set the church ablaze. San Gabriel Mission Church in Los Angeles County was set on fire, destroying parts of the 249-year-old iconic structure. Vandals were charged with a hate crime after they partially disfigured Mission San Jose, a church in Fremont, California.
Also in July, Sacred Heart Catholic school in Gallup, New Mexico was broken into and a statue of Jesus was vandalized. A statue of Jesus was beheaded at Good Shepherd Catholic church in South Florida. ""Satanic"" and ""anarchist"" symbols were found on the church door at St. Joseph's Church in New Haven. In August, Bibles were burned in Portland.
In a sane world, we could all agree that vandalism of any kind is morally wrong. But we don't live in such a world.
Nikole Hannah-Jones, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist responsible for the New York Times' historically flawed ""1619 Project,"" says, ""Destroying property, which can be replaced, is not violence.""
David Remnick of the New Yorker is a big fan of BLM. He quotes, with relish, a co-founder of the racist organization. ""We don't have time to finger-wag at protesters about property. That can be rebuilt."" So could his house if someone torched it.
Two left-wing geniuses, Robin D.G. Kelley, an historian at UCLA, and R.H. Lossin, whose Ph.D. in Communications is from Columbia, both wrote lengthy defenses this past June about the violent Antifa and BLM mobs.
Kelley wrote in the New York Times that because ""we are in the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, looting should not surprise anyone."" But the looters stole toasters, not bread. They also helped themselves to pricey sneakers and jewelry, neither of which is edible. No matter, he chided the public for ""obsessing over looting.""
Lossin wrote her screed in the pages of the Nation, a Stalinist media outlet. ""Property destruction is not synonymous with the violence that is being protested,"" she opines. ""Plateglass windows don't bleed."" Neither does her laptop. But it's a sure bet she would object if a sledgehammer were taken to it. She is also no fan of non-violence. ""The notion that nonviolence is tactically more effective...has not only been proven wrong over the past week by sheer numbers; it cannot be historically supported.""
It would be hard to find a single professor of a conservative bent (thanks to the ""tolerant-minded"" professoriate, there aren't too many of them) who would belittle property crimes and denounce peaceful protests. Such sages are only found on the Left.
Forgive me if I can't get too exercised about BLM banners being set on fire. Antifa and BLM burn the American flag, churches, Catholic schools, and cop cars. The media and left-wing activists have no moral ground to stand on when they bash those of us who object to the latter while they go bonkers over the former.

Jerrold Nadler, D-New York, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, issued the following floor statement on Sept. 17:
* * *
Today, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) delivered the following statement, as prepared, on the House floor in support of H.Res. 908, Condemning all forms of anti-Asian sentiment as related to COVID-19:
""Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 908, a resolution condemning all forms of anti-Asian sentiment as related to COVID-19.
""Among other things, the resolution, introduced by my colleague from New York, Representative Grace Meng, calls upon all public officials to condemn and denounce anti-Asian sentiment, and it calls on Federal law enforcement officials to investigate and document all credible reports of hate crimes against Asian-Americans, to collect data on the rise of hate crimes incidents due to COVID-19, and to hold perpetrators accountable.
""The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing crisis for our country. Over 6.6 million Americans have been infected, and almost 200,000 have died from COVID-19. It has upended the lives of almost every American in some way and it will continue to do so for some time as we brace for a potential second wave of infections.
""On top of bearing the burdens that the pandemic has imposed on all Americans, Asian-Americans have been forced to carry the added anxiety of confronting racial prejudice, including racially-motivated harassment and violence, stemming from a stigma that has unfairly associated them with COVID-19 because of the virus's origins in China, a stigma that has been reinforced by rhetoric suggesting such a link.
""According to the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, since March 19, there have been almost 2,600 cases of anti-Asian discrimination related to COVID-19. According to the resolution, at the pandemic's earliest stage in this country, between February 9 and March 7, there were over 400 such incidents.
""These include the stabbings of an Asian-American father and his two young children, ages 2 and 6, in Texas.
""Public health entities including the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have recognized that labeling a virus by geographic or ethnic terms unfairly stigmatizes certain communities and ultimately harms public health. For this reason, Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar rightly condemned the use of the phrase 'Chinese virus' in testimony before the Ways and Means Committee, stating that 'ethnicity is not what causes the novel coronavirus.'
""It is incumbent on all public figures, including elected officials like us, to publicly condemn bigotry and the stigmatization of racial or ethnic groups unfairly targeted for blame. We must speak out clearly against such attitudes and acts of hate whenever they occur, but particularly in the face of public panic or fear during a national emergency, when society can be especially vulnerable to racist appeals and prejudices.
""While many public figures have admirably sought to end COVID-19-related racial animosity, some, unfortunately, appear not to share the same sense of moral duty. Rather than using their bully pulpits to confront prejudice and racial hatred, they have, instead, chosen repeatedly to use derogatory and prejudicial phrases and remarks reinforcing the exclusion and stigmatization of Asian-Americans in the face of a national crisis--a tactic that, sadly, has a long and ugly history in our country. Left unchecked, this type of rhetoric has, in the past, led to grave injustices like the Chinese Exclusion Act and the internment of Japanese-Americans during the Second World War.
""In the year 2020, condemning bigotry and racial scapegoating should not be hard for any Member of this House to do. It is long past time to leave the days of 'yellow peril' hysteria and unjustified blame of the ""other"" behind. The House can take an important step in that direction by passing H. Res. 908 unanimously. I urge you strongly to support this resolution.
""I reserve the balance of my time.""

U.S. Representative Antonio Delgado (NY-19) voted to pass the Justice in Policing Act of 2020, comprehensive police reform legislation. Rep. Delgado is an original co-sponsor of the Justice in Policing Act.
""Americans in communities of all colors are calling out and demanding action to address racial injustice in our country. Today, the House took an important step in that direction by increasing transparency and accountability in policing. I voted for the Justice in Policing Act to implement needed reforms around law enforcement, and I encourage the Senate to take up these overdue measures as soon as possible,"" said Rep. Delgado.
Measures outlined in the bill include amending the mens rea requirement in 18 U.S.C. Section 242, the federal criminal statute to prosecute police misconduct, from ""willfulness"" to a ""recklessness"" standard; reforming qualified immunity so that individuals are not entirely barred from recovering damages when police violate their constitutional rights; improving the use of pattern and practice investigations at the federal level by granting the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division subpoena power and incentivizing state attorneys general to conduct pattern and practice investigations; incentivizing states to create independent investigative structures for police involved deaths through grants; and creating best practice recommendations based on the Obama 21st Century Policing Task force.
The legislation seeks to increase transparency into policing by creating a National Police Misconduct Registry and requiring that state and local law enforcement agencies report use of force data, disaggregated by race, sex, disability, religion, age. The bill also includes police training and practices to end racial and religious profiling, mandating training on racial bias and the duty to intervene, banning no-knock warrants, banning chokeholds and carotid holds, and changing the standard to evaluate whether law enforcement use of force was justified from whether the force was reasonable to whether the force was necessary. This bill also limits the transfer of military-grade equipment and requires federally uniformed police officers to wear body cameras. The Justice in Policing Act of 2020 makes lynching a federal crime under federal hate crime laws.
Earlier this month, Rep. Delgado penned an op-ed in the Washington Post on his experiences as a black man in America and the importance of leading with love and engaging in democracy through voting.

NASCAR on Thursday released a photo of the noose that was found last weekend in the Talladega Superspeedway garage stall assigned to Darrell Wallace Jr., the lone black driver in NASCAR’s premier series, following criticism that racing officials had overreacted.
“As you can see from the photo, the noose was real, as was our concern for Bubba,” Steve Phelps, the president of NASCAR, using Wallace’s nickname, told reporters in a telephone news conference on Thursday.
Federal officials said Tuesday that they had determined that Wallace, 26, had not been the target of a hate crime, forcing him into the position of defending himself from the baseless accusation that he or his racing team staged the incident to gain favorable publicity.
While NASCAR characterized the noose as a pull rope for a garage door that was “fashioned like a noose,” other people insisted it was just a rope with a handle. The statement from the Department of Justice called the rope a “noose.”
Phelps acknowledged that NASCAR’s own investigation was inconclusive. “We were unfortunately unable to determine with any certainty who tied this rope in this manner or why it was done,” he said.
He also said the sport had enhanced security for Wallace, was installing cameras in all NASCAR garages, and would require sensitivity training for NASCAR employees, in order to prevent any similar episodes in the future.
“We want everyone with a love for racing to feel welcomed and a part of our NASCAR family and our industry is going to protect our own against anyone that feels differently,” Phelps said.
The image was released two days after the authorities concluded that no federal crimes were committed.
The noose was discovered Sunday afternoon by a member of Wallace’s racing team, who alerted NASCAR officials, Phelps said. The organization then informed Wallace of the discovery and released a statement that evening calling it a “heinous act.” The following day, federal officials opened an investigation.
Jay E. Town, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama, and Johnnie Sharp Jr., the head of the F.B.I.’s office in Birmingham, Ala., said that video footage showed the noose had been in the garage as early as October 2019, before anyone knew it would be assigned to Wallace for the Geico 500 on Monday.
In a statement posted on Twitter on Wednesday, Wallace said he was relieved “that the investigation revealed that this wasn’t what we feared it was.”
“I think we’ll gladly take a little embarrassment over what the alternatives could have been,” he added.
The discovery of the noose came amid national protests over police brutality and systemic racism following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis last month, and NASCAR’s recent ban of the Confederate battle flag from its events and properties. Wallace, who called for the ban, had also unveiled a “Black Lives Matter” message on his racecar this month.
On Thursday, Phelps defended his initial response.
“Should we have toned that message down slightly? Maybe we should have,” he said. “And I’ll take responsibility for that. I stand by the actions that we took and I think they were the right ones.”
As part of NASCAR’s investigation, 1,684 garage areas across 29 racetracks were inspected, he said. Only 11 pull-down ropes tied into a knot were found and only one of those — the one found in Wallace’s garage — was tied in a noose, he said.
Phelps said he was surprised by the results of the federal investigation, since he and others initially believed it may have been a hate crime.
He said he was troubled by the idea that several people saw the noose before it was brought to the attention of NASCAR officials.
“Odds are someone saw it and didn’t react negatively to it,” Phelps said. “So we need to make sure that doesn’t happen in the future.”

 ''I think we'll gladly take a little embarrassment over what the alternatives could have been,'' he added.
 The discovery of the noose came amid national protests over police brutality and systemic racism following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis last month, and NASCAR's recent ban of the Confederate battle flag from its events and properties. Wallace, who called for the ban, had also unveiled a ''Black Lives Matter'' message on his racecar this month.
 On Thursday, Phelps defended his initial response.
 ''Should we have toned that message down slightly? Maybe we should have,'' he said. ''And I'll take responsibility for that. I stand by the actions that we took and I think they were the right ones.''
 As part of NASCAR's investigation, 1,684 garage areas across 29 racetracks were inspected, he said. Only 11 pull-down ropes tied into a knot were found and only one of those -- the one found in Wallace's garage -- was tied in a noose, he said.
 Phelps said he was surprised by the results of the federal investigation, since he and others initially believed it may have been a hate crime.
 He said he was troubled by the idea that several people saw the noose before it was brought to the attention of NASCAR officials.
 ''Odds are someone saw it and didn't react negatively to it,'' Phelps said. ''So we need to make sure that doesn't happen in the future.''

The grainy image, which shows three people in dark hoods and white masks, looks like something out of a horror movie. Detectives in Denver, who released the picture on Tuesday, hope it will lead them to the people who set fire to a house this month, killing five members of a Senegalese family.
The Denver police also released photos of the dark-colored four-door sedan in which the masked individuals are believed to have fled and said that information leading to an arrest could result in a $14,000 reward.
The fire, which tore through a two-story home in the Green Valley Ranch neighborhood in northeastern Denver at about 2:30 a.m. on Aug. 5, killed Djibril and Adja Diol and their daughter Khadija, 2, as well as Mr. Diol’s sister Hassan Diol and her infant daughter, Hawa Baye, the police said.
All five were members of a loving, kind, helpful and energetic family from Senegal, the Colorado Muslim Leadership Council said in a statement.
“This loss has left a huge void in our Colorado Muslim community, just days after celebrating the Islamic holiday Eid al-Adha,” the council said. “We call upon the Denver police and the Denver Fire Department to expedite their arson investigation and bring those responsible to justice. The tragic loss of life of this young family will not be tolerated.”
Police and fire officials said that they had opened a homicide investigation after determining that the fire had been set intentionally. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has been helping to investigate, the police said.
The victims were all found on the first floor, the authorities said. A police officer tried to rescue the family members, but was thwarted by the flames, the authorities said.
“I want the family, the local community of Senegal and the country of Senegal to know you have our full commitment and devotion to this case,” Joe Montoya, the investigations division chief for the Denver police, said at a news conference on Aug. 7. “We have every hope that we are going to find the individual or individuals responsible for this and bring them to justice.”
Asked if the fire was a hate crime, Chief Montoya did not discount that possibility but said, “At this time, we don’t want to get tunnel-visioned into a motive.”
“There are some cases on the front end that’s very evident as to what the motive was for a crime; this is not one of those cases,” he said. “So we have to go into it very open-minded and look at every possible angle.”
Chief Montoya said the police would notify the community if the fire had been motivated by hatred. The Denver police said on Wednesday that there were no updates on the case.
About 2,000 immigrants from Senegal live in the greater Denver area, according to Papa Dia, a Senegalese community leader and a spokesman for the family of the victims.
Mr. Dia said the flames and smoke were so intense that the family members could not get out of the house.
“Our hearts, our soul have been shattered,” Mr. Dia said at the news conference on Aug. 7. “The only thing that can give us peace is to be able to identify the individuals who did this horrific crime and bring them to justice.”
Mr. Diol’s younger brother, Moussa Diol, asked investigators to do all in their power to find those responsible.
“That was my family, my everything,” Mr. Diol said at the news conference. “It’s hard to really talk right now because I’m still heartbroken and so emotional right now. But it hurts. It hurts a lot, just to wake up and lose your family like that.”
Mr. Dia described Djibril Diol as a hard worker and a devoted family man who had graduated from Colorado State University and was a civil engineer. The man’s father lives in New York and came to Colorado after the fire, he said.
After the fire, a steady procession of Senegalese immigrants gathered outside the charred remnants of the home, which is near Denver International Airport.
“We are not used to seeing something like this take place,” Mr. Dia said. “We consider ourselves part of this society, part of this great nation we call home.”
The president of Senegal, Macky Sall, wrote on Twitter after the fire that it was a serious matter and that he was closely monitoring the situation. He also extended his condolences to the families of the victims.
Speaking at the news conference, Elhadji Ndao, the consul general of Senegal, thanked the police for their work on the case.
“All we are asking for, and that you are concerned about, is for justice to be served, for whoever did this to be found and brought to justice for the sake of peace and security in this great city of Denver, but also for the sake of comfort to its citizens, including Senegalese nationals,” Mr. Ndao said.

The top court in the US has ruled that employers who fire workers for being gay or transgender are breaking the country's civil rights laws.
In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court said federal law, which prohibits discrimination based on sex, should be understood to include sexual orientation and gender identity.
The ruling is a major win for LGBT workers and their allies.
And it comes even though the court has become more conservative.
Lawyers for the employers had argued that the authors of the 1964 Civil Rights Act had not intended it to apply to cases involving sexual orientation and gender identity. The Trump administration sided with that argument.
But Judge Neil Gorsuch, who was nominated to the court by President Donald Trump, said acting against an employee on those grounds necessarily takes sex into account.
""An employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex,"" he wrote.
Members of the LGBT community across the US were celebrating on hearing the news.
'An emotional day'
Sean K Heslin, Palm Springs, California
Today's Supreme Court ruling brought me to tears.
As a gay man lucky enough to live in California and originally come from New York I've never had to personally worry about losing a job or not being hired simply because of my sexual orientation.
But as a financial adviser working with clients all around the country for over 30 years, I've heard countless stories of people who have lost their jobs simply for being gay. It's angered and saddened me for so long.
For years now, I have been speaking at seminars or with friends and family about how in this day and age it's still perfectly legal to fire someone just because they're gay. Many people didn't believe me. Until today.
What does the ruling mean?
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 forbids employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of sex as well as gender, race, colour, national origin and religion.
Under the Obama administration, the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which enforces the anti-discrimination law, said it included gender identity and sexual orientation. But the Trump administration has moved to roll back some protections in healthcare and other areas.
While some states in the US had already explicitly extended such protections to LGBT workers, many have not.
It's difficult to overstate the significance of the decision.
While the court is establishing a long history of decisions expanding gay rights, this is the first time it spoke directly about the legal protections for transgender individuals.
That the ruling comes out just days after the Trump administration announced it was removing transgender health-insurance protections only puts the issue in stark relief.
Transgender rights is becoming a political battlefield, and a majority of the Supreme Court just announced which side it's on.
What have campaigners said?
LGBT advocates hailed the decision as the end of people hiding their sexuality at work.
""Especially at a time when the Trump administration is rolling back the rights of transgender people and anti-transgender violence continues to plague our nation, this decision is a step towards affirming the dignity of transgender people and all LGBTQ people,"" said Sarah Kate Ellis, president of GLAAD.
The American Civil Liberties Union shared a prepared statement from transgender plaintiff Aimee Stephens, who died last month. Her case was the first major transgender civil rights case heard by America's top court.
""I am glad the court recognised that what happened to me is wrong and illegal,"" Ms Stephens said. ""I am thankful that the court said my transgender siblings and I have a place in our laws - it made me feel safer and more included in our society.""
But the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian non-profit that asked the court to hear Ms Stephens' case, said it was disappointed in the ruling.
It warned it would ""create chaos and enormous unfairness for women and girls in athletics, women's shelters and many other contexts"".
What did the court say?
In his opinion, Mr Gorsuch said such matters were not before the court.
""The only question before us is whether an employer who fires someone for being homosexual or transgender has discharged or otherwise discriminated against that individual 'because of such individual's sex',"" he wrote.
The answer, he said, was ""clear"" - even if such a scenario had not been anticipated when the law was written.
""It is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex,"" he wrote.
Three conservative justices opposed the ruling: Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh.
What are the cases?
The ruling resolves three cases brought by people who said they had been fired after their employers learned they were gay or transgender.
Ms Stephens had previously presented as a man at work for six years before writing a letter to colleagues saying she would return to work ""as my true self, Aimee Australia Stephens, in appropriate business attire"".
Two weeks later, Ms Stephens was fired for insisting in working in women's clothes.
In a court filing last year, the funeral home owner argued it wanted Ms Stephens to comply with a dress code ""applicable to Stephens' biological sex"".
A lower court sided with Ms Stephens.
Donald Zarda, a skydiving instructor from New York who died in a skydiving accident in 2014, had filed one of the other cases.
He was dismissed after joking with a female client with whom he was tandem-diving not to worry about the close physical contact because he was ""100% gay"".
The company maintained he was fired because he shared personal information with a client, not because he was gay, but a court in New York ruled in Mr Zarda's favour.
Gerald Bostock, a former child welfare services co-ordinator from Georgia, lost his job after joining a gay recreational softball league, thereby publicly revealing his sexual orientation.
His employer, Clayton County, said his dismissal was the result of ""conduct unbecoming of a county employee"".
Mr Bostock lost his discrimination case in a federal court in Atlanta.

July 20, 2020
To: The Honorable William P. Barr, Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice, 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20530
Dear Attorney General Barr:
Thank you for featuring the quote ""Coronavirus is no excuse for hate"" on the Department of Justice's hate crimes website. The COVID-19 pandemic affects all Americans and has wrought enormous pain in the United States./1
Some Americans are facing increased discrimination as a result of the pandemic. We write to draw particular attention to an increase in verbal and physical attacks as well as discrimination towards Asian Americans who have been wrongly blamed for the virus' spread. We respectfully request that you publicly condemn acts of anti-Asian bias, and provide us with regular status updates regarding the steps the Department of Justice is taking and will take going forward to combat this behavior.
Asian Americans are not responsible for the spread of coronavirus in the United States; yet, since the start of the pandemic they have experienced continued harassment, violence, and discrimination. As of June 3, the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council reported 2,066 incidents of coronavirus-related discrimination./2
These and numerous news reports have documented cases ranging from the denial of services at stores to verbal harassment on the subway to physical assaults.
In one particularly egregious instance, an individual in Texas stabbed three Asian Americans, two of whom were children, because he thought they were infecting others with COVID-19. In March, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Houston field office acknowledged the likelihood of a surge in hate crime incidents against Asian Americans./3
And most recently, a new Ipsos survey conducted for the Center for Public Integrity found that more than 30 percent of Americans have witnessed someone blaming Asian people for the coronavirus pandemic./4
We appreciate the op-ed the Department placed in the Washington Examiner generally stating that hate crimes will be investigated and prosecuted./5
However, the dangers faced by the Asian American community today are very real and deserve a strong and specific response by our government. In fact, on May 8, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights acknowledged its concerns ""over the increase in xenophobic animosity toward Asian Americans (and perceived Asian Americans) as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic"" and unanimously issued recommendations urging federal agencies reduce this sentiment./6
We note that in the early 2000s during the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak, the Bush Administration immediately took steps to prevent discrimination against Asian Americans by creating a community outreach team to monitor and document acts of anti-Asian bias and engage with the community.
Two years earlier following the September 11 terrorist attacks, the Administration had similarly sought to prevent attacks against Arab, Muslim, Sikh, and South Asian American communities by engaging with community leaders, conducting coordinated civil rights enforcement, and speaking out forcefully./7
While these prior responses were not perfect, they represented an important effort to acknowledge and address the specific discrimination.
Despite the fear present within the community, each and every day Asian Americans help to combat COVID-19. While Asian Americans comprise 7 percent of the U.S. population, 17.1 percent of active medical physicians are Asian American./8
Similarly, Asian Americans are serving our country by working as nurses, health aides, and in many other essential occupations. Asian Americans are just as American as any other group of people in our country.
We respectfully request that you, as head of the Department of Justice, forcefully condemn anti-Asian bias to send an unambiguous message to all Americans that discrimination against this community is un-American and will not be tolerated. Further, we would ask that you update us regularly as to what steps the Department has taken to address our concerns. Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

209,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_251/Files (250).DOCX","thetimes.co.uk",2020-11-29,"1264 words","NEWS; Version:1","Laura Pullman, New York",NA,"Wealthy New Yorkers hire protection on the streets after spike in violent attacks",FALSE,"Wearing a radio earpiece, but no mask, my bodyguard greets me outside Penn station in Manhattan with an outstretched hand and I am too English to offer him my elbow instead. Stockily built, Patrick McCall is carrying a gun, is trained in krav maga — a fighting technique developed by the Israel Defence Forces — and has worked in security and private investigation his whole career.
He claims he is 6ft, which is curious because he seems to be shorter than me and I am definitely 5ft 8in. Not that size matters.
In the past, McCall, 36, usually looked after celebrities and the wealthy. Now, nervous New Yorkers of middling means are hiring personal security guards to escort them about their daily lives. I was intrigued to try the service myself.
It seems an extreme measure, but the Big Apple — where some shop fronts remain boarded up — certainly feels rattled after a year of coronavirus devastation (more than 24,000 deaths in the city), anti-police riots, election chaos and an alarming spike in violent crime.
I live on the top floor of a tall apartment building, yet my flatmate was recently woken up, terrified, at 1am as a man ranted at the wind directly outside her bedroom window. Having climbed up to the fire escape, seemingly high on drugs, he kept trying to clamber onto our rooftop.
With jangled nerves, we have been watching the Manhattan murder mystery 
 The Undoing 
 through our fingers, and shuddering as Nicole Kidman’s character takes her solitary, late-night walks through the city.
The Sky Atlantic drama, which has its finale in the UK tomorrow, is not one to watch for those in the city who are currently too anxious to leave their apartments (something a friend’s wife is enduring).
The idea that “New York is over”, as one fabulously wealthy heiress recently told me on a white sand beach, is ludicrous, but nowadays seemingly everyone has a New York nightmare to share.
“New Yorkers used to need a shrink and meds; now it’s a shrink, meds and a bodyguard,” said a colleague born and bred in the city, suggesting that security details are a new status symbol.
For my bodyguard, who runs the McCall Risk Group, the after-dark jobs typically involve escorting groups of female friends on nights out.
The business in looking after “average Joes” has increased 80% in the past year, he said.
“It’s everybody from corporate executives to tourists to housewives who want to go out and do some shopping but they’re afraid,” said McCall, who lives outside the city in Westhampton with his wife and four children.
The hourly rate is $50 (£38), and you can specify the type of bodyguard you’re after: plainclothes or suited, male or female, imposing physique or someone who will blend in easily.
Often male clients will request female security: “Some guys are a little embarrassed — they’re in pretty good shape and feel emasculated, so ask us to tone it down and send someone who’s not intrusive.”
Many customers want to be chaperoned on their daily commute. Pasquale Cosenzo, a computer programmer, is accompanied by one of McCall’s agents for the short walk between Penn station and his office in midtown Manhattan.
“It’s not that I can’t handle myself — I don’t want to deal with it,” said Cosenzo, 48. “I can’t risk my safety, my family’s safety or my co-workers’ safety because I get into an argument with some guy who’s on drugs or mentally ill.”
He and two female colleagues hired protection after a friend of one of the women was assaulted in the neighbourhood.
Certainly, the homelessness crisis around Penn station is stark, but it seems more sad than scary. “There’s a lot of drug use, urinating, defecating — a lot of people running around with no clothes on even in temperatures like this,” said McCall as the thermometer hits 5C at night.
He recalled a stabbing nearby last weekend: “The person appeared to be an EDP [emotionally disturbed person] and he went up and stabbed this person several times with a knife. Our client saw it, froze and we had to physically move him.”
According to the New York police department, murders are up 37% this year compared with the same period in 2019, and the number of shootings has more than doubled compared with last year. However, robbery, assault and hate crimes are all down.
Criminologists dismiss the oft-repeated narrative that New York is slipping back into a crime-ridden hellhole of the past.
“Total crime is down 82% from 1990 so we are certainly not backsliding into the lawlessness that people fear about from the 1990s,” said Christopher Herrmann, an assistant professor at the city’s John Jay College of Criminal Justice. “This isn’t a numbers thing — it’s a perception thing. If you can afford the personal security and want to feel ‘safer’, I’m glad to hear there are companies providing this service.”
McCall and his agents, many of whom have law-enforcement backgrounds, provide reassurance during fractious times. “We give clients peace of mind. We want to keep them away from any bad elements, and from seeing any bad elements,” he said.
As we head for my office through Times Square, my bodyguard sternly fends off smiley tourist touts. The streets are busy with festive shoppers and Thanksgiving crowds and he is on high alert. “I use windows and glass to monitor behind and to the side. Stopping at the corner, I’ll turn sideways so I can see both directions,” explained McCall.
After the important task of retrieving my favourite “Tea-rex” dinosaur mug from the office, we visit the Rockefeller Centre’s much-mocked Christmas tree, which has had to undergo “branch extensions” after it arrived looking decidedly straggly.
When he is not protecting the rich, the famous and the paranoid, McCall digs up evidence for defence lawyers in murder cases as part of his private investigation work.
Sadly, he has not seen 
 The Undoing 
 so we cannot talk “whodunnit” and Hugh Grant playing a cheating spouse. McCall now largely avoids tracking unfaithful partners in so-called “matrimonial cases” as he finds it too depressing.
“We had a client who hired us to do surveillance on his girlfriend,” he recalled. “This gentleman had a wife and family at home, and he was quite upset that his girlfriend was cheating on him. He was like, ‘How could she do this to me?’”
Pounding the pavements, I feel untouchable in McCall’s company and it is nice having someone to chat to during my daily chores. “Some clients are very lonely and they like the interaction,” he said. “The unwritten rule is, ‘Speak when you’re spoken to.’”
Hunting for presents with McCall trailing me around the shop, the assistants seem to think that I am famous, which I enjoy hamming up. Is bag-carrying part of the package? “I like to have my hands free, but if the client wants us to carry the bags, we’re on their dime.”
Unsurprisingly, McCall is full of criticism of Bill de Blasio, the beleaguered Democratic mayor, who supported slashing police budgets by $1bn this summer. “The police don’t feel that they’re supported or that they’ll be backed if something happens,” said McCall. “They’re kind of taking the approach of, ‘I’m not getting involved because the job’s not going to protect me.’”
McCall’s final task of an admittedly unrisky assignment is to accompany me on the Subway home. The police increased their patrols of the Subway stations last week after a recent rise in people being shoved onto the tracks.
However, in the middle of the day, the train full of hipsters heading back to Brooklyn gawp, confused at my security setup. I feel protected — but also a bit of a prat."

You know that annoying person who takes on the accent of the place they happen to be? That would be me. And the one who won't - can't - stop, even when it's, say, a wedding or a wake and either way entirely inappropriate? Also me.
I can spend days pretending to be from Limerick or Dublin, which segues nicely into Jamaica - not as unfeasible or un-PC as it sounds, given forced emigration to the Caribbean was so high in the 17th century that a quarter of Jamaicans now claim Irish ancestry.
On holiday this year, my husband almost crashed the car due to my deranged (I like to think he meant pricelessly funny) impersonation of a New York taxi driver demanding we stop for ""cawfee on rowte to Joisey"". Totes hilarious.
Back in Ireland, I become so darn Irish (think Chicago on St Patrick's Day, except greener) that other Irish people can't actually understand me. Which brings me back to Emily and Jamie, whose woeful brogue has gone rogue.
Given Jamie is from Co Down in Northern Ireland, he has no excuse for not getting to grips with southern vowels down the road. As for Emily, I can only sigh with disappointment because she and her husband actually have a holiday home in West Cork.
Supporting actor Christopher Walken also deserves a dishonourable mention in dispatches for his attempt to strangle the language of WB Yeats and George Bernard Shaw.
Fortunately, the Irish think it's hilarious, as attested on high by The Irish Times headline: ""What in the name of holy bejaysus is this cowpat?"" And on low, by the viewer who asserted that ""these accents constitute a hate crime"".
Poor Emily. Maybe she's too A-list to have immersed herself in rainswept Ireland for too long. But if she wanted to mug up on her Irish lilt, she could always have holidayed somewhere almost everyone speaks with a Cork accent - the Caribbean island of Monserrat.

In part, they are being reflected in the surge of riots, arson and other violent crime that even the Left no longer bothers to deny. But while the denials have withered, in their place have come the dodges and excuses. 
One of the most popular is that (ever heard this one?) 'correlation is not causation.' Hey, look — the story goes — violent crime has always tended to increase in warmer months. It's not the woke culture's anthem of fury; it's just correlation with the weather. So what's to worry? What's to worry is that if we tell people whose stability is none too good to start with that they are justified in their anger and hate, eventually they'll believe us. And when they believe us, they're going to act on what we've been telling them.The story[2] from the New York Post is titled, 'Man nabbed for Bronx rape allegedly said she 'deserved it' for 'slavery.'' It begins (emphasis added): A black parolee arrested for raping and bashing a white woman on the roof of his Bronx apartment building allegedly told a witness that she 'deserved' the brutal attack because of slavery, according to court papers. 'She was a white girl. She deserved it because us minorities have been through slavery,' Temar Bishop, 23, allegedly said to someone who witnessed the bloodied 20-year-old woman after the assaults, according to a criminal complaint. 'This is what they used to do to us. This is what they did to us during slavery. They used to beat us and whip us.' Temar Bishop, 23, was arrested by authorities on Friday in Virginia on a slew of charges connected to the early morning June 1 assault, which officials have deemed a hate crime, according to authorities. The 20-year-old met Bishop — who was on parole after serving just over a year behind bars for robbery — around 5 a.m. and joined him on the rooftop of the public housing building on Alexander Avenue near East 137th Street in Mott Haven, police said. I'll wager $1000 here and now that this will not be that last bloody crime this month that the perpetrator will 'justify' using exactly the mantra the Amerika Stinks movement has been blasting out. Any takers? And yes, the rapist was on parole. Well, why not? The academic 'experts' who've been rebuking us for years about 'incarceration nation' have always thought that the risks of our policy choices should be borne, not by those who decide that stealing and brutality are the way to a fast buck or a rollicking good time, but by the next victim. And if it's a rape victim, well, she'll get over it. The post Anarchy, One Rape at a Time[3] appeared first on Crime &#38; Consequences[4].

On Oct. 27, 2018, a man armed with a semiautomatic rifle and three pistols entered Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue and murdered 11 congregants. In addition to raging anti-Semitism, the killer had a more immediate motive: fury that the synagogue had participated in the National Refugee Shabbat, sponsored by the humanitarian group HIAS, formerly known as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society.
“HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people,” he wrote on a social network. “I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I’m going in.”
The killer’s immigration obsession, emerging from the same bonfire of bigotries that President Trump had stoked for years, led many people, including me, to conclude that the president could not be excused from what had happened in Pittsburgh. Anti-Semitism flourishes when adjacent hatreds — of “globalists,” “corporate media,” “Hollywood” and so on — cease to be taboo. Anti-Semitism also flourishes when the purveyors of these adjacencies cease to be disreputable.
What goes for the right and its uglier obsessions goes also for the left, in ways the left is sometimes loath to recognize.
There are writers who strain to make the case that anti-Zionism cannot be conflated with anti-Semitism. But when a gunman murders four French Jews in a Paris market in part because he’s mad about the plight of Palestinians, it becomes clear that anti-Zionism can bleed into anti-Semitism.
There are left-wing party leaders who think a public mural depicting elderly bankers playing Monopoly on the backs of naked figures is just a critique of rapacious capitalism. Those who notice the prominent noses on the bankers have reason to think otherwise.
There are cultural arbiters ready to cancel anyone’s careers over bigotry — except when, say, the rapper Ice Cube or the N.F.L. player DeSean Jackson, or the N.B.A. player Stephen Jackson posts anti-Semitic messages on social media.
“Given the new woke-fulness in Hollywood and the sports world, we expected more passionate public outrage,” the basketball legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar sharply observed last summer. “What we got was a shrug of meh-rage.”
There are magazine editors who are racing to live down a reputation for indifference to — or worse, perpetuation of — racism inside their publications. But when one of these same magazines publishes a flattering profile of Louis Farrakhan devotee Tamika Mallory with pious attention to her social activism but no mention of her acceptance of Farrakhan’s anti-Semitism it passes without comment or objection on the left.
There are leading left-wing political activists who claim that Israel “is built on the idea that Jews are supreme to everyone else,” implying that any form of Zionism, including progressive Zionism, is inherently sympathetic to white supremacy. But when a Jewish undergraduate is hounded off a student council (“Impeach her Zionist ass,” according to the social media campaign against her) she may understandably wonder whether the hoary equivalence of Zionism and racism hasn’t become another pretext to target Jews.
The list goes on. In the months after the Pittsburgh massacre, I sometimes heard the argument that Jews had far more to fear from the anti-Semitism of the Charlottesville right — which, after all, had led to the shedding of human blood in Pittsburgh and later at a synagogue in Poway, Calif. — than from the anti-Semitic “microaggressions” from other quarters. Mainstream media reports added to the perception that the rise in hate crimes, including crimes against Jews, was overwhelmingly a function of right-wing hate.
But then a tsunami of anti-Semitic assaults came crashing down on the Orthodox communities in New York, largely perpetrated by “young men of color,” according to The Times. And then five people were murdered in two separate terrorist attacks in Jersey Cityand Monsey, N.Y. In neither of these fatal attacks against Jews were white supremacists involved.
All of this should serve as stark reminders that when it comes to anti-Semitism, neither left nor right nor Black nor white has any kind of monopoly. No less important, no side is free of political leanings that are, if not anti-Semitic, then perilously close to it. The Trumpian right’s obsession with border walls, protective tariffs and drastic cuts to legal immigration is a vehicle for a toxic brand of American nationalism that over time cannot bode well for American Jews.
But the left’s fetish with pyramids of privilege and intersections of oppression is just as toxic, if not more, considering the broad success of American Jews in the ladders of educational, economic and cultural attainment. Whenever the success or merit of a minority group turns into a presumption of social guilt — whether it was the Asian community in Idi Amin’s Uganda, the Chinese in Suharto’s Indonesia, or Jews in Weimar Germany — the consequences tend to be catastrophic.
Two years ago, a once-unthinkable attack became an all-too-thinkable possibility for every synagogue in America. In itself, Pittsburgh should serve as a permanent reminder of how easily the politics of demonizing immigrants can lead to killing Jews.
But the broader lesson is that any ideology that borders on anti-Semitism can easily descend toward it. And anyone who isn’t calling out his own side as much as the other speeds that descent.

217,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_251/Files (250).DOCX","The Independent (United Kingdom)",2020-11-13,"730 words","NEWS; Version:1","Via AP news wire",NA,"Calls for independent investigation of Black teen's death",FALSE," Activists and the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana are calling for an independent investigation into the death of a Black 15-year-old whose body was found several days after he was reported missing.
""This is a nightmare,"" Quawan ""Bobby"" Charles' mother, Roxanne Nelson, told The Associated Press, adding that she's heard conflicting accounts of what preceded her son's disappearance. ""I've had to go on a wild goose chase just to get information ""
A fundraising page, set up to raise $15,000 for Charles' family, had brought in more than $160,000 by Thursday. It's topped by post-death photographs' of Charles' face with parts of his lips missing, and the face of 14-year-old Emmett Till, who was lynched in 1955. Charles' family took the picture of his face, said civil rights attorney Ron Haley, one of three representing the family.
It ""looks like a hate crime,"" NAACP Louisiana Conference President Michael McClanahan said in a livestreamed interview for his weekly radio show Sunday on WTQT-FM in Baton Rouge. In an interview Thursday, he said he was hoping to get the Justice Department to investigate it as a hate crime.
However, Haley said he did not know whether damage to Charles' face was caused by violence or by decay from days in Louisiana's humid heat.
An independent autopsy by American Forensics of Mesquite, Texas, will answer that and other questions, he said. He said Charles' body was sent there on Tuesday and he expects a report late this week or early next week.
Nelson said her family filed a missing persons report Oct. 30 in the St. Mary Parish town of Baldwin.
Her son's body was found the evening of Nov. 3 about 20 miles (32 kilometers) away in woods near the Iberia Parish town of Loreauville.
Nelson said Thursday that sheriff's investigators told her this week that her son drowned, but they also were waiting for toxicology test results.
The coroner's office has told the family its preliminary results and will not release any information to the public until the final report is in - something that can take eight to 12 weeks, according to an email from that office.
The Iberia Parish Sheriff's Office is investigating the death as a possible homicide because of ""suspicious circumstances,"" spokeswoman Katherine Breaux told The Associated Press on Thursday. No arrests have been made, and the Sheriff's Office declined earlier to say whether investigators detected any signs of foul play.
Breaux said Sheriff Tommy Romero and case investigators met Monday with Nelson and Charles' father.
""This is an ongoing investigation and there's little information we can give out"" to the public, Breaux said. ""One thing we want the public to know and understand is that our investigators deal with facts, rather than rumors and social media speculations.""
Charles' family wants to put up a cross but has not been able to learn just where his body was found, André Arceneaux of Youngsville, an activist who was called in by the family, said Wednesday.
They also want to know why Baldwin police did not call for a statewide Amber Alert even though Nelson alleged that Charles might have been abducted, Haley said.
Louisiana State Police, who issue such alerts, were not asked to do so and are not part of the investigation into Charles' death, Lt. Nick Manale, a state police spokesman, said in an email Thursday.
Authorities in the two parishes have provided little information to the family, Haley and the ACLU said Wednesday.
""We join the family in demanding a full and transparent investigation into the circumstances surrounding Bobby's death,"" Alanah Odoms Hebert, ACLU of Louisiana executive director, said in a news release Wednesday. ""This family is grieving and deserves answers - not disrespect and stonewalling."" 
The Baldwin Police Department declined to comment Wednesday. In a Facebook post on Tuesday, Assistant Chief Samuel Wise III said the department was not investigating the death but was looking into ""reasons why the deceased juvenile was missing from his residence in Baldwin.""
Haley said, ""I believe he was murdered and I believe somebody tried to cover it up. How, why, we don't know. Folks have made the connection that it was a hate crime. I'm not ready to go there yet - there is much to be learned.""
""Something hateful was done to him. ... Motivation does not make it worse or not worse,"" Haley said.

An American Muslim woman says she ""felt humiliated"" after receiving a Starbucks coffee cup with the name of the Takfiri terrorist group ""ISIS"" (Daesh) written on it.
The woman identified by CNN only as Aishah said a Starbucks employee wrote the word on her coffee cup after she ordered the drink from a store in a Target in St. Paul, Minnesota, according to a report.
She said when she went to tell the employee her name, the barista scribbled something on the side of the cup before she could finish, the report added.
The employee then handed her the drink, which had the word ""ISIS"" written on it in black marker.
""The moment I saw it, I was overwhelmed with a lot of emotions,"" Aishah told the network.
""I felt belittled and so humiliated. This is a word that shatters the Muslim reputation all over the world. I cannot believe that in this day and age, something like this can be considered acceptable. It isn't OK,"" she added.
The state's Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) is now demanding that all staff involved in the incident be fired from the store.
A spokesperson for Target, which operates the Starbucks store, told CNN the labeling was ""an unfortunate mistake.""
""We have investigated the matter and believe that it was not a deliberate act but an unfortunate mistake that could have been avoided with more clarification. We're taking appropriate actions with the team member, including additional training, to ensure this does not occur again,"" they said in a statement.
Nineteen-year-old Aishah, who wears a hijab, a headscarf worn by Muslim women, has filed a discrimination charge against Target after the July 1 incident.
Jaylani Hussein, executive director of CAIR-MN, said labeling someone who is Muslim as ""ISIS"" is ""perhaps the most Islamophobic statement you can make towards a Muslim.""
The number of Islamophobic incidents in the United States has spiked following the election of President Donald Trump, according to the CAIR.

Critics say that Trump's rhetoric and policies against Muslims before and after his election has emboldened far-right groups and promoted anti-Muslim hate crimes across the country.
Some scholars say Trump's travel ban on people from several Muslim-majority countries was aimed at spreading Islamophobia and demonizing Muslims.

220,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_251/Files (250).DOCX","The New York Times",2020-07-07,"1518 words","Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 1","By Maggie Haberman",NA,"Trump Adds to an Old Playbook As He Stokes White Resentment",FALSE,"With a defense of Confederate flags and a false accusation against a Black NASCAR driver, Bubba Wallace, President Trump is focusing on racial and cultural flash points to appeal to his base.
President Trump mounted an explicit defense of the Confederate flag on Monday, suggesting that NASCAR had made a mistake in banning it from its auto racing events, while falsely accusing a top Black driver, Darrell Wallace Jr., of perpetrating a hoax involving a noose found in his garage. 
 The remarks are part of a pattern. Almost every day in the last two weeks, Mr. Trump has sought to stoke white fear and resentment, portraying himself as a protector of an old order that polls show much of America believes perpetuates entrenched racism and wants to move beyond. 
 Two weeks ago, the president retweeted a video of a supporter shouting ''white power'' at a retirement community filled with older people whom he wants to win over. Last week, he wrote that he was reviewing a fair housing regulation that is aimed at eliminating racial housing disparities in the suburbs, but that he said would have a ''devastating impact'' on those communities -- a play to white suburbanites whose votes would be crucial to his re-election.
 On Monday, he also tweeted his displeasure with sports teams that are reviewing the appropriateness of nicknames that are offensive to Native Americans, seeking to curry favor with Americans who believe political correctness has gone too far. He has invoked fear of crime with tweets about sanctuary cities and crime rates in New York and Chicago, and has spoken of preserving ''our heritage,'' picking up the language of those who want to honor the Confederacy. 
 For many Republicans who are watching the president's impact on Senate races with alarm, his focus on racial and cultural flash points -- and not on the surge of the coronavirus in many states -- is distressing. 
 ''This is part of the same selfish, divide-and-conquer strategy that helped the president get elected in 2016,'' said Carlos Curbelo, a former Republican congressman from Florida who has been critical of Mr. Trump. ''Of course that strategy worked for much of the president's base, and it certainly benefited him in the past, but it's selfish in the sense that it is extremely damaging for Republicans in swing states, in swing districts.''
 Mr. Curbelo added, ''It's always been clear, but this is a reminder that the president looks out for himself first, second and third.'' 
 Mr. Trump's inflammatory behavior shows how out of step he is with shifting national sentiment on racial justice, as big corporations, sports leagues and cultural institutions express greater solidarity with Black Americans protesting systemic racism. Even some Republicans have been open to discussions about removing Confederate statues.
 While NASCAR and other organizations have moved to retire symbols of the Confederacy, and lawmakers in Mississippi voted to bring down the state flag featuring the Confederate battle emblem, Mr. Trump continues to cast himself as a defender of the history of the American South, despite its stains of slavery and oppression. He has called the phrase ''Black Lives Matter'' a ''symbol of hate,'' and he has repeatedly tried to depict pockets of violence during protests against entrenched racism as representative of the protest movement as a whole.
 Mr. Trump also delivered official speeches over the weekend that emphasized defending American historical figures like George Washington and some abolitionists, though he avoided explicit references to totems of the Confederacy. 
 But on Monday he was back invoking the Confederacy, with his reference to NASCAR's ban on Confederate flags, while also attacking Mr. Wallace, the only Black driver on NASCAR's top circuit.
 Mr. Wallace, nicknamed ''Bubba,'' had called for NASCAR to ban the flag from its events, and the sport agreed to prohibit it from its races and its properties. At the start of race week at the Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama last month, a member of Mr. Wallace's racing team found a noose hanging in the driver's garage stall and reported it to NASCAR.
 ''Has @BubbaWallace apologized to all of those great NASCAR drivers & officials who came to his aid, stood by his side, & were willing to sacrifice everything for him, only to find out that the whole thing was just another HOAX? That & Flag decision has caused lowest ratings EVER!'' Mr. Trump posted on Twitter on Monday.
 Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, offered a contorted defense of Mr. Trump's tweet about the Confederate flag and Mr. Wallace during an early afternoon briefing. 
 She insisted Mr. Trump was being taken out of context, and invoked Jussie Smollet, the Black television actor known for his role on the TV series ''Empire,'' who is facing charges that he lied to the authorities about a hate crime attack that detectives said he had staged last year in Chicago. 
 No one has credibly suggested Mr. Wallace manufactured the noose that was discovered in his garage stall by a colleague. F.B.I. officials later found that the knot had been tied into the rope as early as October 2019, well before anyone would have known that Mr. Wallace would be assigned that stall for the race.
 Ms. McEnany claimed that the original reports about the incident painted NASCAR members as ''racist individuals who were roaming around and engaging in a crime.''
 But Mr. Trump received pushback from Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and an informal adviser to the president, who said Monday that he disagreed with Mr. Trump's tweet.
 ''They're trying to grow the sport,'' Mr. Graham said, according to the CNN reporter Manu Raju, referring to NASCAR's ban on Confederate flags, which it announced last month. ''And I've lived in South Carolina all my life and if you're in business, the Confederate flag is not a good way to grow your business.''
 Mr. Graham, who is facing a strong challenge from Jaime Harrison, a Black Democrat, in his re-election bid, said that ''one way you grow the sport is you take images that divide us and ask that they not be brought into the venue. That makes sense to me.'' He said that Mr. Wallace did not have ''anything to apologize for,'' and that his fellow drivers should be applauded for supporting him.
 ''I would be looking to celebrate that kind of attitude more than being worried about it being a hoax,'' Mr. Graham said, according to Mr. Raju.
 (Mr. Trump was also wrong in his tweet in characterizing NASCAR's television audience as having fallen to its ''lowest ratings EVER!'' The broadcast of Sunday's Brickyard 400 was seen by about 4.3 million viewers, a 39 percent increase from the average NASCAR race that aired on NBC last year, according to Nielsen.)
 Later on Monday, Mr. Trump added another inflammatory tweet, weighing in on recent announcements by the Washington Redskins of the N.F.L. and the Cleveland Indians of Major League Baseball that the teams would review their names. While many Native Americans and other advocates for change consider the names deeply offensive, Mr. Trump baselessly claimed that Native Americans would be ''very angry'' about the potential changes.
 ''They name teams out of STRENGTH, not weakness, but now the Washington Redskins & Cleveland Indians, two fabled sports franchises, look like they are going to be changing their names in order to be politically correct,'' Mr. Trump tweeted. He added a jab at a favorite target, Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has apologized for her past claims of Native ancestry. ''Indians, like Elizabeth Warren, must be very angry right now,'' the president wrote.
 Eleven minutes later, Mr. Trump again referred to the coronavirus as the ''China Virus,'' a phrase that critics say is racist, xenophobic and harmful to Asian-Americans.
 Mr. Trump's tweets came just days after he delivered a divisive speech at Mount Rushmore in South Dakota as part of the July 4 holiday, in which he denounced Democrats as radical anarchists and said that children are taught in schools to ''hate'' the United States. In that address he avoided specifically mentioning anything related to Confederate monuments.
 He talked more generally about efforts to take down statues across the country, conflating what is primarily an attempt to remove statues of Confederate generals with others questioning monuments to people like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.
 ''Angry mobs are trying to tear down statues of our founders, deface our most sacred memorials, and unleash a wave of violent crime in our cities,'' Mr. Trump said in the speech. ''Many of these people have no idea why they are doing this, but some know exactly what they are doing.''
 Some of Mr. Trump's advisers have tried to persuade him to focus less explicitly on statues of Confederate generals, given that he is taking an unpopular position. But after sticking to the script in his Friday night speech, he was clear about his support for the Confederate flag in his tweet on Monday.

Lowey Secures Record Funding for Nonprofit Security Grants in FY 2021 Homeland Security Funding Bill",FALSE,"Rep. Nita Lowey, D-New York, issued the following news release:
Congresswoman Lowey (D-NY17/Rockland-Westchester), Chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, and the Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee, approved by voice vote the Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 Homeland Security funding bill. The $50.72 billion proposal includes $10.8 billion for Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and $3.66 billion for Federal Assistance, which includes funding for the Urban Areas Security Initiative (UASI) Nonprofit Security Grants and the newer non-UASI Nonprofit Security Grants within the State Homeland Security Grant Program (NSGP-S) that Chairwoman Lowey created in FY 2018. The increases of $473.9 million above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $1.18 billion above the President's budget request for Federal Assistance include record-level funding for the nonprofit security grants.
""In response to the rise in anti-Semitic incidents and violent hate crimes, our draft bill quadruples funds for nonprofits and religious institutions to help prevent and protect against terrorism and targeted, violent extremism,"" said Congresswoman Lowey. ""The record funding for nonprofit security grants in both UASI and non-UASI regions would enable the Westchester, Rockland, and the broader New York nonprofit community to protect themselves with increased security measures and greater peace of mind so that they can gather safely. It brings me great pride to know that a program I created is helping to keep children and families safe and secure across the Lower Hudson Valley. As the appropriations process continues, I will keep fighting to bring home increased funding for New York.""
Combined funding for nonprofit security grants in both UASI (NSGP-U) and non-UASI regions (NSGP-S) was $90 million in FY 2020. The House Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee approved a combined funding level of $360 million in the FY 2021 bill, which would be an increase of $270 million, or a quadrupling of funding, for nonprofit security grants. Individually, NSGP-S would receive a record $180 million in FY 2021, marking a $140 million increase from $40 million in FY 2020. The NSGP-U would receive a record $180 million in FY 2021, which would be a $130 million increase from $50 million in FY 2020. The bill is expected to be considered by the full Appropriations Committee in the coming days.
In FY 2018, Congresswoman Lowey successfully created the Nonprofit Security Grant Program carve-out within the State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP) to support nonprofit organizations located outside of UASI-designated urban areas, such as Rockland County. The new program was originally funded at $10 million in FY 2018. As Chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, Congresswoman Lowey was instrumental in securing an increase of $30 million in FY 2020 to support nonprofit security. Last week, the Congresswoman announced that at least 25 organizations in the 17th Congressional District will receive a total of $2,565,028 of those federal funds.

Local leaders and the community are rallying behind the Sikh-owned restaurant, India Palace, in Santa Fe, which suffered $100,000 in damages during the attack discovered on Monday, the Santa Fe New Mexican newspaper reported.
Besides causing extensive damage to the restaurant, the vandals had written slogans in support of President Donald Trump and ""White Power"", and racist remarks like ""Go Home,"" according to the Santa Fe Reporter.
It said that the kitchen was completely made unusable, tables were overturned, glassware was smashed, wine racks were emptied, the statue of a ""goddess"" was beheaded and computers were stolen.
The restaurant had reopened only recently after being closed due to the COVID-19 restrictions.
Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham tweeted on Tuesday, ""We will not stand for such hatred in New Mexico."" She added that she had spoken to restaurant-owner Bajit Singh to ""let him know that our community is with him.""
Mayor Alan Webber described the vandalism a ""sickening and appalling"" hate crime and vowed, ""We will find whoever did it and punish them to the full extent of the law.""
He said, ""The Singhs are a long-standing Sikh family that has used its own resources to feed homeless Santa Feans through the goodness of their hearts. For them to be attacked this way breaks our hearts.""
The Singh family distributes free packages of food and sanitary products for homeless people in the area and these items were stolen during the attack, according to the Reporter.
The Reporter said that five fundraising campaigns have been launched to help the restaurant.
A 'GoFundMe' campaign by another restaurant Paper Dosa had raised more than $35,000, the New Mexican said.
One of the pictures of the graffiti posted on the Reporter's website was against the terrorist organisation Islamic State.
Because of their turbans, Sikhs are sometimes mistaken for Islamist or Iranian clergy who are represented in the media with turbans and are attacked.
The Council on American-Islamic Relations National Communications Director Ibrahim Hooper said in a statement, ""This disturbing hate attack once again demonstrates that growing white supremacy, xenophobia, Islamophobia, and racism target every minority community and must be challenged by people of all races, faiths and backgrounds.""

The proposed bill - currently called The Justice in Policing Act of 2020 - would make it easier to prosecute police misconduct and recover damages from officers found to have violated the constitutional rights of civilians.
Crucially, the bill will also increase pressure on the Justice Department to address systemic racial discrimination by law enforcement, The New York Times reports, having obtained a copy of a summary of the bill being circulated on Capitol Hill.
Sponsoring the bill are California's Karen Bass, the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, which took the lead on drafting the legislation; Jerry Nadler of New York, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee; Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey; and Senator Kamala Harris of California.
It is believed that the four will introduce the legislation on Monday.
The bill would require state and local governments to introduce mandatory anti-bias training among other non-discrimination programmes.
A national register of police misconduct would be created and a ban on chokeholds and other practices that have led to deaths would be implemented.
The legislation also proposes federal standards on the use of force to make it a last resort rather than a question of reasonable use, with a focus instead on de-escalation. 
The thrust of the changes to misconduct rules would see a shift from it being a crime for a police officer to ""willfully"" violate a person's constitutional rights and instead doing so ""knowingly or with reckless disregard"".
There would also be changes to qualified immunity rules that stop individual officers being held legally liable for damages from those whose rights they have violated.
Federal officers will be required to use body and dashboard cameras and states would be mandated to use federal funds to ""ensure"" their use. Also proposed is a limit on military weaponry being deployed by state and local law enforcement. 
A ban on ""no-knock warrants"" in drug cases is also included in the bill, in light of the death of Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed in her Louisville home during a police raid in March.
New powers would be given to Justice Department investigators, and state attorneys general would be incentivised to conduct investigations of police violations of the constitution. 
A provision making lynching a federal hate crime would also be included - a current proposal is being held up in the Senate by Rand Paul.
As policing is largely managed at the local level, there are limits to what changes can be achieved by DC lawmakers.
 An email to colleagues from the Senate and House Democrats that authored the bill reads: ""Persistent, unchecked bias in policing and a history of lack of accountability is wreaking havoc on the black community.""
""Cities are literally on fire with the pain and anguish wrought by the violence visited upon black and brown bodies,"" it continues. 
""While there is no single policy prescription that will erase the decades of systemic racism and excessive policing -it's time we create structural change with meaningful reforms.""
The final text of the bill, and even its name, are still being worked on this weekend.
While any final proposal should easily pass the Democrat-controlled House, prospects in the Senate are less clear and could involve a compromise with Republicans leading to more limited changes.
Republican Senator Kevin McCarthy of California has said that the party will work with Democrats on the legislation. It is unclear what the response from President Trump will be, given his hard line on law and order.
Nevertheless, the proposal is one of the most ambitious reforms of law enforcement ever proposed."

President Trump mounted an explicit defense of the Confederate flag on Monday, suggesting that NASCAR had made a mistake in banning it from its auto racing events, while falsely accusing a top Black driver, Darrell Wallace Jr., of perpetrating a hoax involving a noose found in his garage.
The remarks are part of a pattern. Almost every day in the last two weeks, Mr. Trump has sought to stoke white fear and resentment, portraying himself as a protector of an old order that polls show much of America believes perpetuates entrenched racism and wants to move beyond. 
Two weeks ago, the president retweeted a video of a supporter shouting “white power” at a retirement community filled with older people whom he wants to win over. Last week, he wrote that he was reviewing a fair housing regulation that is aimed at eliminating racial housing disparities in the suburbs, but that he said would have a “devastating impact” on those communities — a play to white suburbanites whose votes would be crucial to his re-election.
On Monday, he also tweeted his displeasure with sports teams that are reviewing the appropriateness of nicknames that are offensive to Native Americans, seeking to curry favor with Americans who believe political correctness has gone too far. He has invoked fear of crime with tweets about sanctuary cities and crime rates in New York and Chicago, and has spoken of preserving “our heritage,” picking up the language of those who want to honor the Confederacy. 
For many Republicans who are watching the president’s impact on Senate races with alarm, his focus on racial and cultural flash points — and not on the surge of the coronavirus in many states — is distressing. 
“This is part of the same selfish, divide-and-conquer strategy that helped the president get elected in 2016,” said Carlos Curbelo, a former Republican congressman from Florida who has been critical of Mr. Trump. “Of course that strategy worked for much of the president’s base, and it certainly benefited him in the past, but it’s selfish in the sense that it is extremely damaging for Republicans in swing states, in swing districts.”
Mr. Curbelo added, “It’s always been clear, but this is a reminder that the president looks out for himself first, second and third.” 
Mr. Trump’s inflammatory behavior shows how out of step he is with shifting national sentiment on racial justice, as big corporations, sports leagues and cultural institutions express greater solidarity with Black Americans protesting systemic racism. Even some Republicans have been open to discussions about removing Confederate statues.
While NASCAR and other organizations have moved to retire symbols of the Confederacy, and lawmakers in Mississippi voted to bring down the state flag featuring the Confederate battle emblem, Mr. Trump continues to cast himself as a defender of the history of the American South, despite its stains of slavery and oppression. He has called the phrase “Black Lives Matter” a “symbol of hate,” and he has repeatedly tried to depict pockets of violence during protests against entrenched racism as representative of the protest movement as a whole.
Mr. Trump also delivered official speeches over the weekend that emphasized defending American historical figures like George Washington and some abolitionists, though he avoided explicit references to totems of the Confederacy. 
But on Monday he was back invoking the Confederacy, with his reference to NASCAR’s ban on Confederate flags, while also attacking Mr. Wallace, the only Black driver on NASCAR’s top circuit.
Mr. Wallace, nicknamed “Bubba,” had called for NASCAR to ban the flag from its events, and the sport agreed to prohibit it from its races and its properties. At the start of race week at the Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama last month, a member of Mr. Wallace’s racing team found a noose hanging in the driver’s garage stall and reported it to NASCAR.
“Has @BubbaWallace apologized to all of those great NASCAR drivers &amp; officials who came to his aid, stood by his side, &amp; were willing to sacrifice everything for him, only to find out that the whole thing was just another HOAX? That &amp; Flag decision has caused lowest ratings EVER!” Mr. Trump posted on Twitter on Monday.
Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, offered a contorted defense of Mr. Trump’s tweet about the Confederate flag and Mr. Wallace during an early afternoon briefing. 
She insisted Mr. Trump was being taken out of context, and invoked Jussie Smollet, the Black television actor known for his role on the TV series “Empire,” who is facing charges that he lied to the authorities about a hate crime attack that detectives said he had staged last year in Chicago. 
No one has credibly suggested Mr. Wallace manufactured the noose that was discovered in his garage stall by a colleague. F.B.I. officials later found that the knot had been tied into the rope as early as October 2019, well before anyone would have known that Mr. Wallace would be assigned that stall for the race.
Ms. McEnany claimed that the original reports about the incident painted NASCAR members as “racist individuals who were roaming around and engaging in a crime.”
But Mr. Trump received pushback from Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and an informal adviser to the president, who said Monday that he disagreed with Mr. Trump’s tweet.
“They’re trying to grow the sport,” Mr. Graham said, according to the CNN reporter Manu Raju, referring to NASCAR’s ban on Confederate flags, which it announced last month. “And I’ve lived in South Carolina all my life and if you’re in business, the Confederate flag is not a good way to grow your business.”
Mr. Graham, who is facing a strong challenge from Jaime Harrison, a Black Democrat, in his re-election bid, said that “one way you grow the sport is you take images that divide us and ask that they not be brought into the venue. That makes sense to me.” He said that Mr. Wallace did not have “anything to apologize for,” and that his fellow drivers should be applauded for supporting him.
“I would be looking to celebrate that kind of attitude more than being worried about it being a hoax,” Mr. Graham said, according to Mr. Raju.
(Mr. Trump was also wrong in his tweet in characterizing NASCAR’s television audience as having fallen to its “lowest ratings EVER!” The broadcast of Sunday’s Brickyard 400 was seen by about 4.3 million viewers, a 39 percent increase from the average NASCAR race that aired on NBC last year, according to Nielsen.)
Later on Monday, Mr. Trump added another inflammatory tweet, weighing in on recent announcements by the Washington Redskins of the N.F.L. and the Cleveland Indians of Major League Baseball that the teams would review their names. While many Native Americans and other advocates for change consider the names deeply offensive, Mr. Trump baselessly claimed that Native Americans would be “very angry” about the potential changes.
“They name teams out of STRENGTH, not weakness, but now the Washington Redskins &amp; Cleveland Indians, two fabled sports franchises, look like they are going to be changing their names in order to be politically correct,” Mr. Trump tweeted. He added a jab at a favorite target, Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has apologized for her past claims of Native ancestry. “Indians, like Elizabeth Warren, must be very angry right now,” the president wrote.
Eleven minutes later, Mr. Trump again referred to the coronavirus as the “China Virus,” a phrase that critics say is racist, xenophobic and harmful to Asian-Americans.

In addition to raging anti-Semitism, the killer had a more immediate motive fury that the synagogue had participated in the National Refugee Shabbat, sponsored by the humanitarian group HIAS, formerly known as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society.
“HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people,” he wrote on a social network. “I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I’m going in.”
The killer’s immigration obsession, emerging from the same bonfire of bigotries that President Donald Trump had stoked for years, led many people, including me, to conclude that the president could not be excused from what had happened in Pittsburgh. Anti-Semitism flourishes when adjacent hatreds — of “globalists,” “corporate media,” “Hollywood” and so on — cease to be taboo. Anti-Semitism also flourishes when the purveyors of these adjacencies cease to be disreputable.
What goes for the right and its uglier obsessions goes also for the left, in ways the left is sometimes loath to recognize.
There are writers who strain to make the case that anti-Zionism cannot be conflated with anti-Semitism. But when a gunman murders four French Jews in a Paris market in part because he’s mad about the plight of Palestinians, it becomes clear that anti-Zionism can bleed into anti-Semitism.
There are left-wing party leaders who think a public mural depicting elderly bankers playing Monopoly on the backs of naked people is just a critique of rapacious capitalism. Those who notice the prominent noses on the bankers have reason to think otherwise.
There are cultural arbiters ready to cancel anyone’s careers over bigotry — except when, say, rapper Ice Cube or NFL player DeSean Jackson, or NBA player Stephen Jackson posts anti-Semitic messages on social media.
“Given the new woke-fulness in Hollywood and the sports world, we expected more passionate public outrage,” basketball legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar sharply observed last summer. “What we got was a shrug of meh-rage.”
There are magazine editors who are racing to live down a reputation for indifference — or worse, racism — inside their publications. But when one of these same magazines publishes a flattering profile of Louis Farrakhan devotee Tamika Mallory with pious attention to her social activism but no mention of her acceptance of Farrakhan’s anti-Semitism it passes without comment or objection on the left.
There are leading left-wing political activists who claim that Israel “is built on the idea that Jews are supreme to everyone else,” implying that any form of Zionism, including progressive Zionism, is inherently sympathetic to white supremacy. But when a Jewish undergraduate is hounded off a student council (“Impeach her Zionist ass,” according to the social media campaign against her) she may understandably wonder whether the hoary equivalence of Zionism and racism hasn’t become another pretext to target Jews.
The list goes on. In the months after the Pittsburgh massacre, I sometimes heard the argument that Jews had far more to fear from the anti-Semitism of the Charlottesville right — which, after all, had led to the shedding of human blood in Pittsburgh and later at a synagogue in Poway, California — than from the anti-Semitic “microaggressions” from other quarters. Mainstream media reports added to the perception that the rise in hate crimes, including crimes against Jews, was overwhelmingly a function of right-wing hate.
But then a tsunami of anti-Semitic assaults came crashing down on the Orthodox communities in New York, largely perpetrated by “young men of color,” according to The Times. And then five people were murdered in two separate terrorist attacks in Jersey City and Monsey, New York. In neither of these fatal attacks against Jews were white supremacists involved.
All of this should serve as stark reminders that when it comes to anti-Semitism, neither left nor right nor Black nor white has any kind of monopoly. No less important, no side is free of political leanings that are, if not anti-Semitic, then perilously close to it. The Trumpian right’s obsession with border walls, protective tariffs and drastic cuts to legal immigration is a vehicle for a toxic brand of American nationalism that over time cannot bode well for American Jews.
But the left’s fetish with pyramids of privilege and intersections of oppression is just as toxic, if not more, considering the broad success of American Jews in the ladders of educational, economic and cultural attainment. Whenever the success or merit of a minority group turns into a presumption of social guilt — whether it was the Asian community in Idi Amin’s Uganda, the Chinese in Suharto’s Indonesia, or Jews in Weimar Germany — the consequences tend to be catastrophic.
Two years ago, a once-unthinkable attack became an all-too-thinkable possibility for every synagogue in America. In itself, Pittsburgh should serve as a permanent reminder of how easily the politics of demonizing immigrants can lead to killing Jews.
But the broader lesson is that any ideology that borders on anti-Semitism can easily descend toward it. And anyone who isn’t calling out his own side as much as the other speeds that descent.

This was released by the representative at the atlanta launch of his 'Platinum' program, which includes proposals aimed at gaining greater support among American African Americans for the upcoming November presidential election.
The president said Democratic White House candidate and former vice president Joe Biden has caused major damage to the black community over the past 47 years. ""They only care about their own power (...) My adversary offers African-Americans nothing but the same old, tired, empty slogans,"" he said, according to CNN.
Among the proposals launched by the president is the increase of up to $500 billion (more than 580 thousand euros) of the budget that African-American communities can access.
He also stressed the importance of achieving ""peaceful"" neighborhoods, greater justice in the judicial system, expanding the school choice system in these areas, as well as creating a ""national clemency project to correct unfair accusations and forgive reformed people.""
Trump's Platinum Plan also proposes that the 'Juneteenth' holiday, the anniversary of the end of slavery in the United States, be recognized as a party at the federal level.
The U.S. president also included his intention to declare as terrorist organizations the white supremacist group Ku Klux Klan, as well as Antifa. In addition, he conveyed his intention to make lynching a hate crime.
Trump said in June that he has been the leader who has made the most progress for the African-American population in the history of the American country with the ""possible exception"" of Abraham Lincoln, under whose mandate slavery was abolished.
In recent days, protesters have taken to the streets of American cities such as Louisville, Washington, New York or Atlanta for the case of Breonna Taylor, a black woman shot in her own home, after the officers involved in her death have not been charged with her death.
Following George Floyd's death on May 25 at the hands of a Minneapolis Police officer, racial tension in the United States has taken center stage again, heightened after new police deaths in recent weeks."

Democrats in Congress plan to unveil expansive legislation on Monday that would make it easier to prosecute police misconduct and recover damages from officers found to have violated the constitutional rights of civilians, and step up pressure on the Justice Department to address systemic racial discrimination by law enforcement. 
 The bill, which House and Senate Democrats have named the Justice in Policing Act of 2020, is a direct response to the recent killings of three black Americans by white civilians and officers that have prompted protests across the country, but it includes policies that civil rights activists have been pushing for decades to combat racial bias and excessive use of force by law enforcement. The New York Times obtained a copy of a section-by-section summary of its contents, circulated privately on Capitol Hill late Friday.
 It would be the most aggressive intervention into policing by Congress in recent memory, and elements of it are certain to meet with staunch opposition from politically powerful police unions and other law enforcement groups that have fought against such efforts in the past. It is not clear whether President Trump, who often aligns himself with law enforcement and has advocated the use of brutal police tactics, will embrace such measures now.
 As currently proposed, it would significantly change federal law and require states and localities to make modifications of their own, such as instituting mandatory bias training, to receive federal funds. It would create a national registry to track police misconduct and require that law enforcement agencies report data on the use of force, as well as ban certain chokeholds and other practices that were used in confrontations with the police that left black Americans dead.
 ''Persistent, unchecked bias in policing and a history of lack of accountability is wreaking havoc on the black community,'' House and Senate Democrats who assembled the package wrote in an email to colleagues on Friday accompanying the summary. ''Cities are literally on fire with the pain and anguish wrought by the violence visited upon black and brown bodies.''
 The effort is being led by Representative Karen Bass of California, the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the House Judiciary Committee chairman, and Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California, the only two black Democrats in the Senate. They cited the deaths of George Floyd in Minnesota and Breonna Taylor in Kentucky that have inspired protests across the country, as well as other well-known victims of such force in recent years.
 ''While there is no single policy prescription that will erase the decades of systemic racism and excessive policing -- it's time we create structural change with meaningful reforms,'' the lawmakers wrote.
 The text of the bill was still being drafted on Saturday and could change before Monday's unveiling, as could the legislation's title.
 Individual lawmakers in both parties have introduced their own proposals in recent days that the House and Senate could still consider going forward, but the bill by Ms. Bass and the others has the imprimatur of Democratic leadership in the House and Senate, as well as the influential black caucus. Democrats believe they will be able to swiftly pass it in the House, but prospects are less clear in the Senate, where the Republican majority is likely to pursue a narrower set of changes.
 Because most police departments are under state and local control, there are limits to the kinds of changes Congress can mandate from Washington. Calls from activists to break up or drastically restructure police departments, for instance, are more likely to be answered at the state and local level.
 Still, the changes Democrats are proposing would be significant.
 If adopted, the bill would rewrite key elements of the federal criminal code related to police misconduct to make it easier to prosecute law enforcement officers and for individuals who are victims of such practices to recover damages.
 The federal police misconduct statute currently makes it a crime for an officer to ''willfully'' violate an individuals's constitutional rights, meaning prosecutors must prove an officer acted with the intention of depriving the person of their rights. Democrats plan to propose lowering that standard of criminal intent to ''knowingly or with reckless disregard.'' The change is likely to face opposition from police unions and their allies.
 The legislation would also alter the legal doctrine known as qualified immunity that shields police officers from being held legally liable for damages sought by citizens whose constitutional rights were violated.
 In addition, Democrats are proposing to change the federal standard for the use of force by officers from ''reasonableness'' to only when it is ''necessary to prevent death or serious bodily injury.'' The bill would require that federal officers use de-escalation tactics and use deadly force only as a last resort. Grants to state and local agencies would require them to do the same.
 In federal drug cases, lawmakers intend to propose banning ''no knock'' warrants, which allow police to enter a residence without warning or identifying themselves, and incentivize states to do the same. Ms. Taylor was shot and killed in her home during such a raid.
 The legislation would also ban chokeholds or other carotid holds, and condition law enforcement funds on states and other agencies doing the same. The technique led to Mr. Floyd's death, prosecutors have said, and the high-profile death in 2014 of Eric Garner in New York.
 It would also limit the transfer of military weaponry to state and local departments.
 It would give new power to Justice Department investigators conducting inquiries into patterns or practices of behavior by police departments that violate the Constitution and incentivize state attorneys general to conduct such investigations on their own.
 Lawmakers would require all uniformed federal officers to wear body cameras and use dashboard cameras, which have been crucial tools to holding officers accountable in many cases, and they would mandate that state and local agencies use federal funds to ''ensure'' their use.
 Democrats would also try to prod state and local law enforcement agencies to undertake a new effort to end discrimination in their practices, by conditioning federal funding on the adoption of policies and training to combat racial and other discriminatory profiling.
 The bill would also impose new requirements on the Justice Department to assemble and promulgate new policing standards for state and local agencies and collect reams of data on police actions all over the country that could inform more changes in the future, particularly when a Democratic administration controls the department.
 The bill would also include a provision, held up in the Senate, that would make lynching a new federal hate crime for the first time in American history.

Cuomo Lays Out 'Say Their Name' Reform Agenda Priorities Following Death of George Floyd",FALSE,"Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D-New York, issued the following transcript on June 5:
To my right, is Major West, New York State Police. To my left, Melissa DeRosa, secretary to the governor. to her left, Robert Mujica, budget director. It was another long and ugly night in the United states of America. Last night, as it was in New York State. Day 97 of the coronavirus crisis, day 12 of the civil unrest dealing with the aftermath of Mr. Floyd's murder. And this, my friends, is a dangerous combination, colliding crises compounding each other. But, our job is to address what is presented, and this is the reality that is presented, and this is what we will deal with.
On the coronavirus situation, there's a lot to learn from what we just went through, and I believe it's a transformative situation for society and something we can really learn from going forward. Coronavirus was a medical issue, was a public health issue, was an economic issue, but more than anything it was a social issue. It was about how people behave, right. And to address coronavirus what we really had to do was change society. It was not a government operation. It was not something I could do governmentally. People had to do it. Government could provide leadership, and we had an operational component, but it was about people making the changes that had to be made. They had to accept it, they had to understand it, they had to change their behavior. That is a monumental undertaking, always.
Social change? When does social change happen? Social change happens when people are presented with the facts, they understand the facts, they believe the facts, there's a plan forward based on the facts, and people care enough to make a difference. With coronavirus, I sat up here every day and I said, here are the facts, here are the number of deaths, here are the hospitalizations, this is what we're looking for, here's a plan that I think can take us forward. Based on those facts, people were motivated because it was about life and death, and about their life and death, and about their family's life and a death, and we went forward. Compare the coronavirus situation to the situation we're in with the social unrest we see, people have seen Mr. Floyd's murder. They're watching what's going on, on the streets, every day, and they're saying enough is enough. And it's what they are seeing and what they know that is disturbing. We are going to show you again, for those of you who haven't seen, a scene from Buffalo and a scene from New York City because this is a story all across the state.
[Shows videos]
This is Buffalo, New York yesterday. I just spoke with Mr. Gugino on the phone who is that gentleman, who - thankfully - is alive. You see that video and it disturbs your basic sense of decency and humanity. Why? Why? Why was that necessary? Where is the threat? Older gentleman and where was the threat? Then you just walk by the person while you see blood coming from his head. Police officers walked by. It's just fundamentally offensive and frightening. It's just frightening. You say, ""Who are we? How did we get to this place?""
Incidents of pushing the press. You have incidents of police getting hit with bricks in the head. You say where are we? Who are we? These are undeniable situations. Buffalo situation, I want to applaud Mayor Byron Brown, Mayor of Buffalo. He suspended the police officers yesterday, immediately and I believe the District Attorney is looking into it from a possible criminal liability point of view. I applaud the District Attorney for moving quickly. People see this, they see the facts. Now, when you have all this emotion you have to focus on the facts and the intelligence of the matter. It can't be about emotion. Of course, police must protect the public safety and police must protect themselves. That's a fact.
Of course, there are also cases of police abuse and the abuse of power. That's a fact. You can have two coincident facts. Mr. Floyd's murder was the breaking point of a long list of deaths that were unnecessary and which were abusive. That is a fact and people are saying, enough is enough. That is a fact. What people are saying is, we must change and we must stop the abuse - and that is a fact. And New York should be at the forefront of that. That has always been New York's legacy as the progressive capital. We are the ones who hold the standard of what is the right progressive reform and New York should pass next week what we call the ""Say Their Name"" Reform Agenda. Say Their Name Reform Agenda comes from the long list of names of people who we have seen who have been abused by police officers, by the criminal justice system, and Mr. Floyd is just the last name on a very long list. Fine. Enough is enough. Change the law, take the moment, reform.
There are four cornerstones for our ""Say Their Name"" Reform Agenda. One, transparency of prior disciplinary records of a police officer. If they're being charged and investigated for abuse their prior disciplinary record is relevant. And by the way, it's relevant one way or the other. If there were no other disciplinary proceedings, that can exonerate the person who is charged. If there are prior disciplinary proceedings for this type of behavior, then yes, it is evidentiary. But people should know. Chokeholds, we went through this with Eric Garner. Again, you saw with it Mr. Floyd's death. But we learned it first with Eric Garner and many, many other cases, by the way. Why? We've seen 911 calls which are race-based false calls. A false 911 call based on race should be classified as a hate crime in the State of New York. We know that it's wrong for the local district attorney to investigate the police force from that county. By executive order, I did the attorney general as an independent prosecutor. That should be codified in law. I did it five years ago. But these are the cornerstones of a real reform agenda that can address what is going on on the street.
Reform works for everyone's interests here. Stopping police abuse vindicates the overwhelming majority, 99.9 percent of police who are there to do the right thing and do the right thing every day. It restores the confidence, the respect, and the trust that you need to make this relationship work. You have to heal the police-community relationship. That has to happen for the sake of the police and for the sake of the community. You look at this looting that's been going on in New York City. This hurts poor communities and distressed communities. You saw many businesses destroyed that are relied upon by that community. You can't have the relationship that works one way or the other. And even in this politically partisan racially charged environment, there is still a truth, and there is still facts, and that's what we have to focus on. That was the truth with the coronavirus. Even though it was all political and everything was partisan, and Democrat, Republican, and red and blue, it was never -- they offer us false choices.
COVID, coronavirus, well, do you want to save people's lives or reopen the economy? And you should reopen the economy and forget public health. Or you should take care of people's health, but not reopen the economy. It was never either or. It can't be either or. I know from a hyperbolic rhetorical partisan, it's one or the other, liberate New York, worry about health, close New York. It was never one or the other. That was unintelligent. It was always both.
It's the same situation here. It's not a question of public safety or civil rights. Whose side are you on, public safety or civil rights? It can't be either or. It can't be police safety or prosecutor safety. Pick a side, which are you on? Red or blue? Democrat or Republican? Who are you with? You have to be with both. Yes, you need public safety, and yes, you need civil rights. Yes, you need police to be safe. And yes, you need the protesters to be safe. These are false choices. We need both. Even in this hysterical moment, you need to be able to hold two truths in your hands at the same time. How do we change society to make these reforms happen? How do you have a new societal awareness? Can you do that? Can you change behavior to respect one another?
You're darn right you can. We know we can because we just did it through this coronavirus in a very fundamental way. You changed people's fundamental behavior, whether or not they leave the house, whether or not they go to school, whether or not they go to work, they changed themselves, remarkably fast and remarkably effective.
We have the lowest number of deaths from coronavirus that we have had since this started. 42 deaths, the lowest number since we started. Eight weeks ago, we had 800. Eight weeks. 800 people die to 42 people die in eight weeks. Amazing. How did you do that? I did nothing. The people of the state radically changed how they behaved. Look at that progress. Lowest number of hospitalizations to date, in a matter of weeks. So we know we can change, and we know we can change dramatically. People are focused, we have a plan, and that's when social reform happens, when people are motivated and people are focused. That was the Civil Rights Act nationally, that was the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire, which changed labor rights in this nation, that was the environmental movement after Storm King, that's was the revolution of LGBTQ rights after Stonewall, that's what we just saw in coronavirus, which will go down in history as one of the great transformational moments of society, and this is a moment to lead in terms of social change. And we will do it because we are New York tough, smart, united, disciplined, loving, and that is what the moment requires. Thank you.

Lankford, Colleagues Lead Letter to Request Additional Grant Funds to Protect Nonprofits From Terrorist Attacks",FALSE,"Sen. James Lankford, R-Oklahoma, issued the following news release on Dec. 9:
Senators James Lankford (R-OK), co-chair of the Senate Bipartisan Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism and member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, sent a letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee today requesting that the Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP) be adequately funded to meet the needs of at-risk organizations this fiscal year.
The funding allocated by this program will support nonprofit organizations most at risk of terror attacks through the acquisition and installation of physical target hardening measures, related preparedness and prevention planning, training, and exercises, and contracted security personnel so faith- and community-based organizations have the critical resources and tools they need to protect lives and property. According to a recent FBI report on hate crime statistics in 2019, 60.2 percent were victims of crimes motivated by offenders' anti-Jewish bias.
Joining Lankford in sending the letter are Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Rob Portman (R-OH), Gary Peters (D-MI), and Jacky Rosen (D-NV).
""This grant program is vital to ensure faith- and community-based nonprofits and houses of worship can keep people safe as they engage with those they serve,"" said Lankford. ""As anti-Semitism reached a frightening new high last year, we must continue to find ways to help prevent terrorist acts and also empower our nonprofits to proactively establish safeguards and security measures, which they sadly need to do but don't necessarily have the funds to fully accomplish without these opportunities for federal assistance.""
""The rise in anti-Semitic and hate-fueled crimes across New York is unconscionable. No community should have to live in fear due to who they are or how they worship,"" said Gillibrand. ""The Nonprofit Security Grant Program is an initiative committed to keeping nonprofits deemed at risk of terrorist attacks safer through critical investments in their physical security. I will always fight to expand NSGP grants so that New Yorkers, and Americans across the country, can gather communally or worship freely and safely, against the threat of violence.""
""FEMA's Nonprofit Security Grant Program is vitally important to ensure nonprofits, particularly faith-based organizations, have the resources necessary to invest in physical security enhancements, training, and contract security personnel to protect against potential attacks. At a time when we have seen a rise in violence against communities of faith, we have a responsibility to ensure this program is appropriately funded to protect at-risk organizations and communities. I am proud to join my bipartisan colleagues to support this crucial program,"" said Portman.
""Places of worship should be a safe haven, and the Nonprofit Security Grant Program is a vital resource for synagogues, mosques and churches that are working to protect their congregations in light of tragic attacks,"" said Peters. ""I have long championed this program, and I'm proud to join my colleagues to call for robust funding that will help ensure houses of worship, cultural institutions and nonprofit organizations in Michigan and across the country can use this important tool to improve their security and continue serving our communities.""
""Anti-Semitic violence in the US has grown at an alarming rate,"" said Rosen. ""Whether it's in Nevada or in any state across the country, we must stand up against hateful violence. I am proud to join my colleagues in demanding that we properly protect places of worship. I will continue working to ensure the security and safety for Nevadans and all Americans.""
""Jewish communities worldwide have witnessed firsthand the rise of antisemitism and hate motivated violent attacks. In our schools, synagogues and community centers we have been targeted by hate and extremists and those looking to mimic their disgusting and deplorable tactics,"" said Eric Fingerhut, President and CEO of the Jewish Federations of North America. ""We know that eradicating antisemitism means addressing violent hate and extremism wherever it exits in partnership with our elected officials and law enforcement. For these reasons we thank Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, along with Senators Rob Portman, Gary Peters, James Lankford and Jackie Rosen, for their leadership on urging increased funding this year to meet the growing security needs of nonprofit faith- and community-based organizations.""
Every year, Congress must specifically allocate funding for the NSGP, which helps nonprofits, deemed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to be at risk of attack, plan for and ready themselves against potential attacks. In addition to hardening facilities, this program has improved efforts to keep at-risk nonprofit organizations safe by promoting emergency preparedness coordination and collaboration activities between public and private community representatives, as well as with state and local government agencies.

To: The Honorable Richard Shelby, Chairman, Senate Appropriations, United States Senate, Washington, DC 20510
The Honorable Shelley Moore Capito, Chairwoman, Senate Appropriations, Subcommittee on Homeland Security, United States Senate, Washington, DC 20510
The Honorable Patrick Leahy, Ranking Member, Senate Appropriations, United States Senate, Washington, D.C. 20510
The Honorable Jon Tester, Ranking Member, Senate Appropriations, Subcommittee on Homeland Security, United States Senate, Washington, D.C. 20510
Dear Chairmen Shelby and Capito, Vice Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Tester,
Thank you for your continued support for the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP) under the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) and the State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP). As you finalize the Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 Homeland Security Appropriations bill, we respectfully ask you to fund NSGP at the funding level that reflects increased risks to the nonprofit sector. Presently, the House and Senate drafts are far apart on recommended levels of funding for the program. The House top line is $360 million and the Senate's $90 million. During conference, we urge you to ensure the NSGP is appropriately funded to meet the needs of at-risk populations. At a time of heightened threat to nonprofit faith- and community-based organizations, a bolstered NSGP will continue to provide our nonprofit partners with critical resources and tools they need to protect lives and property.
The NSGP provides for grants to nonprofits deemed at risk of terrorist (or violent extremist) attack, to acquire and install physical security enhancements, conduct preparedness planning, training and exercises, and contract security personnel. The program has improved efforts to keep at-risk nonprofit organizations safe by promoting emergency preparedness coordination and collaboration between public and private community representatives as well as state and local government agencies. Today's quickly evolving threat environment provides a compelling public interest in protecting against attacks on the nonprofit sector that would disrupt the vital health, human, social, cultural, religious, and other humanitarian services and practices they provide to communities, and which threaten the lives and well-being of millions of Americans who operate, utilize, live, and work in proximity to them.
At the beginning of this year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Homeland Security and National Counterterrorism Center jointly assessed that Domestic Violent Extremists and Racially/Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremists (RMVEs) will continue to pose a lethal threat to faith-based communities, particularly the Jewish community, and remain concerned about the difficulty of detecting lone offenders due to the individualized nature of the radicalization process./1 During a recent Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearing on threats to the Homeland, FBI Director Christopher Wray testified that the number one threat the nation faces from domestic violent extremists stems from RMVEs, who are considered the most lethal of all domestic extremists in the post-911 environment./2 To illustrate his point, Director Wray recounted the arrest last November of Richard Holzer on federal domestic terrorism and hate crime charges for attempting to blow up a historic synagogue in Pueblo, Colorado and provoke ""a racial holy war.""/3
Additionally, according to the latest FBI Hate Crime Statistics 2019 report,/4 which was released earlier this month, reported hate crimes motivated by religious bias increased by 100 to a total of 1,650 in 2019, of which more than 60 percent were anti-Jewish incidents (a more than 14 percent increase). Per this reporting, the Jewish community remains the top target of faith-based hate crimes for the 23rd consecutive year.
These assessments underscore the persistent threat of lethal violence and hate crimes against the Jewish community and other faith- and community-based institutions in the United States. These groups have too frequently been the victim of many different types of violence. At this time of rising concern, FEMA has reported that on average only about one-third of nonprofits seeking critical security investments secure funding, annually./5 The requests exceed the available resources every year. Yet, in today's threat environment, demand for NSGP resources is expected to grow substantially more, further widening the needs gap.
Since its inception, the program has maintained bi-partisan, bicameral support as an efficient and effective means to accomplish a great deal of security enhancement and preparedness through modest grants./6 With this support and for the reasons stated above, we respectfully encourage you to bolster the NSGP funding, so our nation can do all that it can to protect at-risk faith- and community- based nonprofits from increasing extremist and hate-motivated threats.
Thank you for your consideration of this request.

238,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_251/Files (250).DOCX","The New York Times",2020-06-06,"1228 words","US; politics","Nicholas Fandos",NA,"Democrats to Propose Broad Bill to Target Police Misconduct and Racial Bias",FALSE,"Elements of the package, to be unveiled on Monday by House and Senate Democrats, are certain to meet with opposition from police unions and their allies.
Democrats in Congress plan to unveil expansive legislation on Monday that would make it easier to prosecute police misconduct and recover damages from officers found to have violated the constitutional rights of civilians, and step up pressure on the Justice Department to address systemic racial discrimination by law enforcement.
The bill, which House and Senate Democrats have named the Justice in Policing Act of 2020, is a direct response to the recent killings of three black Americans by white civilians and officers that have prompted protests across the country, but it includes policies that civil rights activists have been pushing for decades to combat racial bias and excessive use of force by law enforcement. The New York Times obtained a copy of a section-by-section summary of its contents, circulated privately on Capitol Hill late Friday.
It would be the most aggressive intervention into policing by Congress in recent memory, and elements of it are certain to meet with staunch opposition from politically powerful police unions and other law enforcement groups that have fought against such efforts in the past. It is not clear whether President Trump, who often aligns himself with law enforcement and has advocated the use of brutal police tactics, will embrace such measures now.
As currently proposed, it would significantly change federal law and require states and localities to make modifications of their own, such as instituting mandatory bias training, to receive federal funds. It would create a national registry to track police misconduct and require that law enforcement agencies report data on the use of force, as well as ban certain chokeholds and other practices that were used in confrontations with the police that left black Americans dead.
“Persistent, unchecked bias in policing and a history of lack of accountability is wreaking havoc on the black community,” House and Senate Democrats who assembled the package wrote in an email to colleagues on Friday accompanying the summary. “Cities are literally on fire with the pain and anguish wrought by the violence visited upon black and brown bodies.”
The effort is being led by Representative Karen Bass of California, the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the House Judiciary Committee chairman, and Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California, the only two black Democrats in the Senate. They cited the deaths of George Floyd in Minnesota and Breonna Taylor in Kentucky that have inspired protests across the country, as well as other well-known victims of such force in recent years.
“While there is no single policy prescription that will erase the decades of systemic racism and excessive policing — it’s time we create structural change with meaningful reforms,” the lawmakers wrote.
The text of the bill was still being drafted on Saturday and could change before Monday’s unveiling, as could the legislation’s title.
Individual lawmakers in both parties have introduced their own proposals in recent days that the House and Senate could still consider going forward, but the bill by Ms. Bass and the others has the imprimatur of Democratic leadership in the House and Senate, as well as the influential black caucus. Democrats believe they will be able to swiftly pass it in the House, but prospects are less clear in the Senate, where the Republican majority is likely to pursue a narrower set of changes.
Because most police departments are under state and local control, there are limits to the kinds of changes Congress can mandate from Washington. Calls from activists to break up or drastically restructure police departments, for instance, are more likely to be answered at the state and local level.
Still, the changes Democrats are proposing would be significant.
If adopted, the bill would rewrite key elements of the federal criminal code related to police misconduct to make it easier to prosecute law enforcement officers and for individuals who are victims of such practices to recover damages.
The federal police misconduct statute currently makes it a crime for an officer to “willfully” violate an individuals’s constitutional rights, meaning prosecutors must prove an officer acted with the intention of depriving the person of their rights. Democrats plan to propose lowering that standard of criminal intent to “knowingly or with reckless disregard.” The change is likely to face opposition from police unions and their allies.
The legislation would also alter the legal doctrine known as qualified immunity that shields police officers from being held legally liable for damages sought by citizens whose constitutional rights were violated.
In addition, Democrats are proposing to change the federal standard for the use of force by officers from “reasonableness” to only when it is “necessary to prevent death or serious bodily injury.” The bill would require that federal officers use de-escalation tactics and use deadly force only as a last resort. Grants to state and local agencies would require them to do the same.
In federal drug cases, lawmakers intend to propose banning “no knock” warrants, which allow police to enter a residence without warning or identifying themselves, and incentivize states to do the same. Ms. Taylor was shot and killed in her home during such a raid.
The legislation would also ban chokeholds or other carotid holds, and condition law enforcement funds on states and other agencies doing the same. The technique led to Mr. Floyd’s death, prosecutors have said, and the high-profile death in 2014 of Eric Garner in New York.
It would also limit the transfer of military weaponry to state and local departments.
It would give new power to Justice Department investigators conducting inquiries into patterns or practices of behavior by police departments that violate the Constitution and incentivize state attorneys general to conduct such investigations on their own.
Lawmakers would require all uniformed federal officers to wear body cameras and use dashboard cameras, which have been crucial tools to holding officers accountable in many cases, and they would mandate that state and local agencies use federal funds to “ensure” their use.
Democrats would also try to prod state and local law enforcement agencies to undertake a new effort to end discrimination in their practices, by conditioning federal funding on the adoption of policies and training to combat racial and other discriminatory profiling.
The bill would also impose new requirements on the Justice Department to assemble and promulgate new policing standards for state and local agencies and collect reams of data on police actions all over the country that could inform more changes in the future, particularly when a Democratic administration controls the department.
The bill would also include a provision, held up in the Senate, that would make lynching a new federal hate crime for the first time in American history.

Portman, Colleagues Lead Bipartisan Push to Increase Funding to Help Protect Nonprofit Institutions Against Terror Attacks",FALSE,"Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, issued the following news release on Dec. 9:
U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Gary Peters (D-MI), James Lankford (R-OK) and Jacky Rosen (D-NV) sent a letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee today requesting that the Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP) be adequately funded to meet the needs of at-risk organizations. The funding allocated by this program will support nonprofit organizations most at risk of terror attacks through the acquisition and installation of physical target hardening measures, related preparedness and prevention planning, training and exercises, and contracted security personnel so that religious and community based organizations have the critical resources and tools they need to protect lives and property. According to a recent FBI report on hate crime statistics in 2019, 60.3 percent of crimes motivated by anti-religious sentiment were against the Jewish community.
""FEMA's Nonprofit Security Grant Program is vitally important to ensure nonprofits, particularly faith-based organizations, have the resources necessary to invest in physical security enhancements, training, and contract security personnel to protect against potential attacks. At a time when we have seen a rise in violence against communities of faith, we have a responsibility to ensure this program is appropriately funded to protect at-risk organizations and communities. I am proud to join my bipartisan colleagues to support this crucial program,"" said Senator Portman.
""The rise in anti-semitic and hate-fueled crimes across New York is unconscionable. No community should have to live in fear due to who they are or how they worship,"" said Senator Gillibrand. ""The Nonprofit Security Grant Program, is an initiative committed to keeping nonprofits deemed at risk of terrorist attacks safer through critical investments in their physical security. I will always fight to expand NGSP grants so that New Yorkers, and Americans across the country, can gather communally or worship freely and safely, against the threat of violence.""
""Places of worship should be a safe haven, and the Nonprofit Security Grant Program is a vital resource for synagogues, mosques and churches that are working to protect their congregations in light of tragic attacks,"" said Senator Peters. ""I have long championed this program, and I'm proud to join my colleagues to call for robust funding that will help ensure houses of worship, cultural institutions and nonprofit organizations in Michigan and across the country can use this important tool to improve their security and continue serving our communities.""
""This grant program is vital to ensure faith- and community-based nonprofits and houses of worship can keep people safe as they engage with those they serve,"" said Senator Lankford. ""As anti-Semitism reached a frightening new high last year, we must continue to find ways to help prevent terrorist acts and also empower our nonprofits to proactively establish safeguards and security measures, which they sadly need to do but don't necessarily have the funds to fully accomplish without these opportunities for federal assistance.""
""Anti-Semitic violence in the U.S. has grown at an alarming rate,"" said Senator Rosen. ""Whether it's in Nevada or in any state across the country, we must stand up against hateful violence. I am proud to join my colleagues in demanding that we properly protect places of worship. I will continue working to ensure the security and safety for Nevadans and all Americans.""
""Jewish communities worldwide have witnessed firsthand the rise of antisemitism and hate motivated violent attacks. In our schools, synagogues and community centers we have been targeted by hate and extremists and those looking to mimic their disgusting and deplorable tactics,"" said Eric Fingerhut, President and CEO of the Jewish Federations of North America. ""We know that eradicating antisemitism means addressing violent hate and extremism wherever it exits in partnership with our elected officials and law enforcement. For these reasons we thank Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, along with Senators Rob Portman, Gary Peters, James Lankford and Jackie Rosen, for their leadership on urging increased funding this year to meet the growing security needs of nonprofit faith- and community-based organizations.""
Every year, Congress must specifically allocate funding for the NSGP. The Nonprofit Security Grant Program helps nonprofits, identified by threat assessments to be at risk of attack, plan for and ready themselves against potential attacks. In addition to hardening facilities, this program has improved efforts to keep at-risk nonprofit organizations safe by promoting emergency preparedness coordination and collaboration activities between public and private community representatives, as well as with state and local government agencies.
In January, Senator Portman and Senator Gary Peters (D-MI) announced that President Trump signed their bipartisan Protecting Faith-Based and Nonprofit Organizations From Terrorism Act into law. This legislation authorizes $75 million annually for five years, from FYs 2020-2024, for NSGP. Under the legislation, funding may be used for target-hardening activities, training for personnel, and any other appropriate activity, as defined by the FEMA Administrator. While the bill authorizes $75 million annually for the program for the next five years, Congress can appropriate more. Portman joined his bipartisan colleagues in December 2019 in requesting that the appropriators fund the program at $90 million. That request was approved and included in the final FY 2020 appropriations agreement.

To: The Honorable Richard Shelby, Chairman, Senate Appropriations, United States Senate, Washington, DC 20510
The Honorable Shelley Moore Capito, Chairwoman, Senate Appropriations, Subcommittee on Homeland Security, United States Senate, Washington, DC 20510
The Honorable Patrick Leahy, Ranking Member, Senate Appropriations, United States Senate, Washington, D.C. 20510
The Honorable Jon Tester, Ranking Member, Senate Appropriations, Subcommittee on Homeland Security, United States Senate, Washington, D.C. 20510
Dear Chairmen Shelby and Capito, Vice Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Tester,
Thank you for your continued support for the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP) under the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) and the State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP). As you finalize the Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 Homeland Security Appropriations bill, we respectfully ask you to fund NSGP at the funding level that reflects increased risks to the nonprofit sector. Presently, the House and Senate drafts are far apart on recommended levels of funding for the program. The House top line is $360 million and the Senate's $90 million. During conference, we urge you to ensure the NSGP is appropriately funded to meet the needs of at-risk populations. At a time of heightened threat to nonprofit faith- and community-based organizations, a bolstered NSGP will continue to provide our nonprofit partners with critical resources and tools they need to protect lives and property.
The NSGP provides for grants to nonprofits deemed at risk of terrorist (or violent extremist) attack, to acquire and install physical security enhancements, conduct preparedness planning, training and exercises, and contract security personnel. The program has improved efforts to keep at-risk nonprofit organizations safe by promoting emergency preparedness coordination and collaboration between public and private community representatives as well as state and local government agencies. Today's quickly evolving threat environment provides a compelling public interest in protecting against attacks on the nonprofit sector that would disrupt the vital health, human, social, cultural, religious, and other humanitarian services and practices they provide to communities, and which threaten the lives and well-being of millions of Americans who operate, utilize, live, and work in proximity to them.
At the beginning of this year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Homeland Security and National Counterterrorism Center jointly assessed that Domestic Violent Extremists and Racially/Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremists (RMVEs) will continue to pose a lethal threat to faith-based communities, particularly the Jewish community, and remain concerned about the difficulty of detecting lone offenders due to the individualized nature of the radicalization process./1 During a recent Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearing on threats to the Homeland, FBI Director Christopher Wray testified that the number one threat the nation faces from domestic violent extremists stems from RMVEs, who are considered the most lethal of all domestic extremists in the post-911 environment./2 To illustrate his point, Director Wray recounted the arrest last November of Richard Holzer on federal domestic terrorism and hate crime charges for attempting to blow up a historic synagogue in Pueblo, Colorado and provoke ""a racial holy war.""/3
Additionally, according to the latest FBI Hate Crime Statistics 2019 report,/4 which was released earlier this month, reported hate crimes motivated by religious bias increased by 100 to a total of 1,650 in 2019, of which more than 60 percent were anti-Jewish incidents (a more than 14% increase). Per this reporting, the Jewish community remains the top target of faith-based hate crimes for the 23rd consecutive year.
These assessments underscore the persistent threat of lethal violence and hate crimes against the Jewish community and other faith- and community-based institutions in the United States.
These groups have too frequently been the victim of many different types of violence. At this time of rising concern, FEMA has reported that on average only about one-third of nonprofits seeking critical security investments secure funding, annually./5 The requests exceed the available resources every year. Yet, in today's threat environment, demand for NSGP resources is expected to grow substantially more, further widening the needs gap.
Since its inception, the program has maintained bi-partisan, bicameral support as an efficient and effective means to accomplish a great deal of security enhancement and preparedness through modest grants./6 With this support and for the reasons stated above, we respectfully encourage you to bolster the NSGP funding, so our nation can do all that it can to protect at-risk faith- and community- based nonprofits from increasing extremist and hate-motivated threats.
Thank you for your consideration of this request.

Baruch College's chapter of Hillel held a remote event on Nov. 12 to commemorate the 82nd anniversary of Kristallnacht, or the Night of Broken Glass.
At the event, students were able to hear the story of Gita Kaufman who escaped Austria as a child as a result of the Holocaust. She is also former schoolteacher and film director.
Her film, ""Shadows From My Past"" tells the story of letters shared between her family members in Vienna, Austria before most of them were killed by Nazis in the Holocaust.
Kaufman escaped from Austria to New York as a child and told Baruch students about her memories of Kristallnacht.
The Night of Broken Glass, in English, was an anti-Semitic attack in November 1938 by Nazi German citizens on Jewish homes, synagogues and businesses. 91 Jews were murdered and 30,000 Jewish men were arrested and sent to concentration camps.
Yehuda Wexler, Hillel's president, spoke to The Ticker about the privilege of hearing first-hand from a Holocaust survivor.
""It was a real privilege to listen to one of the few Holocaust survivors still alive. In recent years, and specifically as a result of our current pandemic, the number of survivors has been dwindling. Even as this happens, the claims of people who wish to deny or downplay the Holocaust are getting louder and more vicious,"" Wexler said.
Wexler commended Kaufman's bravery to tell her story for the anniversary of Kristallnacht.
""Mrs. Kaufman was brave enough to speak not only with our students, but also in the making of her documentary, 'Shadows from my Past,' which details her experience throughout the Holocaust,"" Wexler said.
Wexler also spoke on the importance that students learn about the Holocaust and be more aware of anti-Semitism today.
""It is necessary now, more than ever, to proliferate this information and her personal story, as hate crimes against Jews continue to rise. The most recent FBI report has over 60% of religion-based hate crimes being committed against Jews, an upwards trend which has been accelerating over the years,"" he said.
Students can watch the event recording on Hillel's Facebook page.

However, while many people have taken to the streets to demand justice, social media has been a great help in expressing social discontent.
On Twitter, many hashtags related to the cause have become trending, such as Floyd's name and the very important #BlackLivesMatter and the #BlackOutTuesday yet, among trending toppics we start to see one that we may not understand very well: #BlueLivesMatter. What does this mean?
m{849079}What is Blue Lives Matter?
Blue Lives Matter is an organization that was born in New York on December 20, 2014 in order to get those who kill a police officer on duty to be tried under the statutes of hate crimes, which began after the assassination of officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu killed by the African-American Ismaaiyl Abdullah Brinsley.
Brinsley had a great criminal record, however, he stated that the murders were perpetuated in revenge for the deaths of African descents Eric Garner and Michael Brown Jr., killed by white police officers, by suffocation and in a shooting respectively, after claiming that both, on different occasions, resisted arrest, in cases very similar to those of George Floyd and that they also aroused outrage.
Floyd's case, however, is reminiscent of the murder of Eric Garner on July 17, 2014. Eleven times Garner shouted, desperate, ""I can't breathe"" while strangled by Daniel Pantaleo, a New York police officer. An hour later, Garner is pronounced dead. pic.twitter.com/XaI2mNs3p6
— Matías Baldo (@matiasbaldo) May 29, 2020
It was these killings that initiated the Black Lives Matter mobilization, so the Blue Lives Matter is considered a racist response to the protests of Afro-descendants for their requests that the killings of officers also be classified as hate crimes.
Moreover, his critics emphasize that police officers do not suffer from systemic violence that groups of African-Americans and other races in the North American country. Since then he has operated to support policemen and their families in ""difficult times"" and is made up of members of that country's law enforcement.
VIDEO: These officers were trying to do their job during a riot when two people took off in a car and resisted arrest. Now the officers have been charged with assault with a deadly weapon.

In the protests, they have spoken out in favor of police brutality and defended officers facing charges for excessive use of force without any justification.
Why did Blue Lives Matter become a trend?
Some Twitter users noticed, U.S. police were using the hashtag with their organization's name to get people to report protests over Floyd's death.
Realizing this, internet users, especially K-pop fans, began posting various fancams on the social network, i.e. videos of their idols using the hashtag to create spam and make that method of reporting ineffective and thus help protect the protesters. It was so effective that it was them, and other users with other content who managed to make it trend.

Thank you for your continued support for the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP) under the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) and the State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP).

Gracias!When Black hotel worker beaten, called 'old monkey,' cops fail to arrest suspects for weeksEven though video surveillance showed a white couple attacking a 59-year-old Black hotel worker, it still took police 17 days to arrest the pair and charge them with hate crime and assault charges.Philip Sarner, 39, and Emily Orbay, 28, were arrestedMonday in Brooklyn and extradited to a predominantly white Connecticut town,where the couple isaccused of assaultingCrystal Caldwell at the Quality Inn on June 26,Stoningtonpolice toldThe Daynewspaper[3]. Caldwell, who suffered a concussion and other injuries to her face, ribs, back, and wrist in the attack, said the person beating her called her an ""old monkey"" andtold her:'Black lives matter? Your life doesn't matter, you don't deserve to live on this earth.'""We are absolutely thrilled that these animals have been taken into custody,"" the injured woman'sattorney, M. John Strafaci, toldThe DayMonday. ""It's been a long time since the assault happened, and Crystal has not gotten much sleep or rest while these animals were at large or on the loose."" Police failed to arrest the suspects initially and instead called a local hospital to check on the male suspect, Fox 61 reported. The hospital,Lawrence + Memorial Hospital, reportedly told police they couldn't enter due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the couple was allowed to get a ride back to the hotel to check out and return to New York, Fox 61 reported. Caldwell told the news station that in the time it took police to arrest the couple, they threatened her son and daughter-in-law on Facebook by saying: ""Ummm ur story is so twisted ... we Called the cops weirdo. We approached the cops. We are still speaking to the cops. Their coming to make a report about u monkeys again. Don't get shot.' Caldwell told Fox 61 in late June that an officer assured her the suspects would be arrested, butthey weren't until nearlytwo weeks later.Stonington police claimed to be working on arrest warrant applications at that time, Fox 61 reported. Attorney Strafaci told theHartford Courant[4]he and his client questioned why it took Stonington police so long to arrest the couple. 'It's clear to us that, had the roles been reversed, had this been a white woman from Mystic who was brutally assaulted like this, the two individuals would have been arrested on the spot,' Strafaci said. Stonington police defended the length of theirinvestigation to the newspaper and said they wanted an 'ironclad' case.

John McEneaney, 57, and his partner Mindy Canarick, 53, of Valley Stream, New York, have been charged after allegedly tormenting Jennifer McLeggan, 39.
Single mum Jennifer alleges that McEneaney wore black face - a claim he denies - and told her to ""go back to where I came from"" and that his friends spat on her yard.
She also claims a dead squirrel was also placed in her garden as part of an alleged sickening campaign of bullying.
The 39-year-old posted videos showing a man walking around with guns and throwing things onto her property.
She also claims McEneaney used a blow torch to intimidate her and also told her she can be ""erased.
He is also accused of firing his pellet gun repeatedly across the single mother's property.
Jennifer, who is a nurse, claims she has been harassed by the couple since she bought a home on the same street in October 2017.
She claims police told her that no arrests could be made unless she was physically harmed.
Amid heightened awareness of racial injustice in America, protestors have gathered on the street after the distraught mum posted about the alleged abuse online.
Jennifer taped a sign to her door - photos of which have went viral - detailing the allegations and how police allegedly refused to help her.
She admits she clashed with fellow residents over her supposedly untidy garden when she first moved in.
The nurse told WABC-TV: ""I bought the property when I was pregnant and this is the truth, the property was in bad shape.
""I'm trying my best to make every effort to clean the property. I've done my best to clean the property.""
Jennifer claims that her neighbors have thrown dog poo onto her yard leading to her being fined.
She said: ""I kept on noticing dog feces. I kept on noticing ticket ordinances from the Valley Stream Village town.
""I keep getting tickets. I keep seeing dog feces.""
This prompted her to install a camera which she claims captured her neighbor throwing the animal excrement.
She said: "" I took that video to court and I won a judgment [of more than $5,000].""
Jennifer claims she has been targeted because of her race - however Nassau County District Attorney Madeline Singas said her office's investigation ""did not find evidence to support a hate crime charge.""
Yet the probe did find ""a pattern of harassing conduct"" by the neighbor.
McEneaney has furiously denied the allegation that he wore blackface insisting he was wearing a ski mask while shovelling snow.
He also denied using a blowtorch to scare his neighbor.
McEneaney says he fears for his life and is getting ""a lot of death threats"" online.
He told Newsday: ""I just want peace ... All I ever wanted was to live in peace.""
Police have received more than 50 calls from both sets of neighbors since Jennifer moved into the area.
Jennifer's lawyer Heather Palmore told New York Daily News: ""For years she felt unsafe coming to a place she was supposed to feel safe at, coming home.
""But it's more representative of the overall state of the poor relationship between the police and the Black community here on Long Island.""
McEneaney has been charged with criminal mischief and harassment while his girlfriend was also charged with criminal tampering, Nassau County District Attorney's Office said."

I know there's ""Special Victims Unit"" and ""Criminal Intent"", but what are the others? - D. W. (Highbury) The original version of the popular American police drama series Law and Order premiered on NBC on September 13, 1990. It was cancelled in 2010, with the final episode airing on May 24.

The first spin-off of the original series was Law and Order: Special Victims Unit, which premiered on September 20, 1999 and focuses on a police division dealing with crimes involving sexual assault. The second spin-off was Law and Order: Criminal Intent, which ran from September 30, 2001 to July 26, 2011 and focused on the police department's Major Case Squad.
Law and Order: Trial by Jury ran from March 3, 2005 to January 21, 2006 and focused on the criminal trial process.

250,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_251/Files (250).DOCX","USA TODAY",2020-10-23,"660 words","NEWS; Pg. 8A","Janie Har, ASSOCIATED PRESS",NA,"San Francisco lets people sue over racist 911 calls; Supervisors approve CAREN legislation",FALSE,"SAN FRANCISCO - Fed up with white people calling 911 about people of color selling water bottles, barbecuing or otherwise going about their lives, San Francisco leaders unanimously approved hate crime legislation giving the targets of those calls the ability to sue the caller.
The Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday on the Caution Against Racial and Exploitative Non-Emergencies Act, also known as the CAREN legislation. It's a nod to a popular meme using the name ""Karen"" to describe an entitled white woman whose actions stem from her privilege, such as using police to target people of color.
All 11 supervisors signed on to the legislation, guaranteeing its passage, despite criticism that the name is sexist and divisive. It comes amid a national reckoning on race sparked by the police killings of Black Americans and instances where white people called for officers to investigate people of color.
""We don't want what happened to Emmett Till in 1955, or the long history of false accusations of Black men and boys in this country, due to weaponizing law enforcement, to threaten, terrorize, and sometimes even kill them, to ever happen again,"" said Supervisor Shamann Walton, who introduced the legislation and is Black.
""I really want to emphasize that 911 is not a customer service line for someone's racist behavior,"" he said.
Walton was the only supervisor to speak. Till was a Black teenager beaten to death in 1955 after accusations by a white woman who later admitted lying.
In May, Amy Cooper, a white woman, called 911 from Manhattan's Central Park, falsely claiming that a Black man - who had politely asked her to leash her dog - was threatening her. She has been charged with filing a false police report.
In San Francisco, a white couple was criticized on social media after video was widely shared of them questioning a Filipino American stenciling ""Black Lives Matter"" on a retaining wall in front of his home in June. They later called police.
James Juanillo said he chose yellow chalk to match the color of the house. When the couple approached him, they repeatedly demanded to know whether it was his home because he was defacing private property.
""They tried to cast it as a criminal scene,"" he said. ""It was me calmly applying chalk, not spray paint, not in the middle of the night but very deliberately. The only thing that was missing was a pinot grigio.""
Supporters of the legislation say it is crushing to be confronted by police because someone saw you as a threat, possibly as a criminal or as not belonging. It's especially terrifying for Black people, whose encounters with police could end in violence.
""This is not hyperbole,"" said Brittni Chicuata, chief of staff for San Francisco's Human Rights Commission. ""This is an established pattern reflected in the disparate treatment of Black people and other people of color in our city and in our country.""
Other places have moved to make placing racist 911 calls a hate crime. California's governor recently signed a measure making the crime a misdemeanor punishable by jail time and a fine. New York approved legislation allowing the victims of racist 911 calls to sue.
The San Francisco legislation gives people the right to sue a 911 caller in civil court, and supporters hope it will make some think twice before turning to police. The discrimination need not be only racial; it can also be due to the person's sex, age, religion, disability, gender identity, weight or height.
The legislation does not spell out the standards needed to sue. But it notes that qualifying calls are those that caused the person to feel harassed or embarrassed; damaged the person's reputation or business prospects; or forced the person from an area where they had a lawful right to be.
The board has received written complaints from eight people - several whose names have different spellings of Karen - saying they support the legislation but object to its moniker, which they call sexist and ageist. "
