Dozens of similar incidents have occurred across the United States.
The driver of a red Toyota first stopped, then unexpectedly accelerated into a crowd of dispersing demonstrators in Bloomington, Ind., on Monday night, injuring two of them in the latest of a disturbing rash of vehicular attacks targeting protesters. 
 The demonstration, inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, had sent several hundred people marching through the college town, demanding the arrest of a small group of men who had threatened a Black civil rights activist.
 Dramatic video footage of the attack showed a woman clinging to the car's hood and a man clutching the driver's door handle as the vehicle zoomed forward. The police were still searching for the hit-and-run driver on Tuesday.
 ''It was terrifying,'' said Rachel Glago, 28, whose friend, she said, had jumped onto the hood to avoid being run over. ''I wanted to stop the car, I wanted to help her, I was screaming, I could hear other people screaming.''
 Dozens of similar incidents have occurred across the United States in recent weeks, although it is difficult to assess which attacks are premeditated and which are prompted by rage when drivers find their route blocked by crowds. The tactic has previously been mostly used by extremist jihadist groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda, as well as Palestinian militants.
 ''It is not just an extremist thing here, but there are social media circles online where people are sharing these and joking about them because they disagree with the protests and their methods,'' said Ari E. Weil, the deputy research director at the Chicago Project on Security and Threats of the University of Chicago. ''Sharing memes and joking about running over people can lead to real danger.''
 There have been at least 66 car attacks nationwide since George Floyd was killed by the Minneapolis police on May 25, Mr. Weil said.
 Seven of them have been by law enforcement officers, he said. That included two in New York which Dermot Shea, the police commissioner, defended as an appropriate use of force because he said the police vehicles were under attack.
 Prosecutors have brought charges in about 24 of the cases so far, Mr. Weil said, including hate crimes, and have dismissed four as accidental.
 Perhaps the most high-profile example of a car attack in the United States is from the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017, when James Alex Fields Jr. killed Heather Heyer, a counterprotester.
 Mr. Fields was found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. Evidence at the trial included the fact that he had shared images online of cars ramming into people before participating in the far-right rally.
 Some of the crashes at recent protests have also been fatal. Summer Taylor, 24, who worked at a veterinary clinic, died on Saturday after a man drove a car through a march on a Seattle highway. Another protester died after being hit in Bakersfield, Calif., in June.
 The driver in Seattle, Dawit Kelete, has not been charged but is being held on $1.2 million bail, and the State Patrol announced it would ban demonstrations from Interstate 5.
 Supporters of far-right organizations -- as well as the occasional government official or law enforcement officer -- have been circulating memes and slogans online encouraging such attacks.
 In Richmond, Va., a driver sought to intimidate protesters with his truck and hit one demonstrator's bicycle in early June, prosecutors said. The driver, who was charged with assault, told the police he was a high-ranking Ku Klux Klan official, court documents said.
 In Seattle, the King County Sheriff's Office announced that one officer had been placed on administrative leave after posting a picture of a vehicle hitting someone under the commonly shared phrase ''All Lives Splatter'' and another line about moving off the road.
 The officer, Mike Brown, is Gov. Jay Inslee's cousin, and the governor said in an interview that he was deeply disappointed by his cousin's post. ''It's never acceptable, but particularly now when we're trying to heal the divisions in our community between police and citizens,'' he said.
 Vehicular attacks have proliferated in recent weeks. Experts believe it is because of the combination of widespread protests across the country and the circulation of dangerous memes among extremist groups about running over pedestrians.
 ''There has been an increasing amount of propaganda online calling for vehicular attacks on protesters, targeting the Black Lives Matter movement in particular,'' said Josh Lipowsky, a senior researcher at the Counter Extremism Project. ''It is being used as a form of intimidation against them to get them to halt their protests.''
 Attacks with vehicles are easy to conduct, he said, because they do not require a lot of planning or financial resources.
 In Bloomington, the two protesters were flung off the car as it made a sharp turn at an intersection, Capt. Ryan Pedigo of the Bloomington Police Department said. But those involved said they would not be intimidated.
 Ms. Glago, who said her friend sustained a concussion, said she was heading out to another protest in Bloomington on Tuesday, determined not to let drivers get away with what she said was ''domestic terrorism.''
 ''I think it is more important to be an anti-racist and to support those with less privilege from you than to just sit at home,'' she said.

I often write an article on the anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks reflecting on the impact that tragedy had on my country and my community. I believe that it is important we never forget how we felt on that day and the days that followed.In a piece I wrote within days of the attack in 2001, I noted how Arab Americans were overcome by a flood of conflicting emotions. We were horrified by the devastation and enormous loss of life. We were shaken by stories of the innocents who lost their lives. We were angry at the murderers who had committed these heinous acts. 
But within hours after the attacks, we were forced to experience fear and isolation when the backlash began — fear because we received threats, and isolation because we were pulled away from the collective grief we were sharing as Americans and forced to look over our shoulders to protect ourselves and families. We also ultimately came to feel gratitude as so many of our fellow citizens came to our defence and protected us. I don't ever want us to forget all of these emotions. They not only define those days, they also tell an important story about America. This year, I didn't write a column about 9/11. Instead, I made do with a few tweets recalling the events and emotions of the day. I am now compelled to write because of the brazenly insensitive and cavalier comments about 9/11 posted by Paul Krugman, a respected Nobel prize-winning New York Times opinion columnist. In a series of tweets, Krugman wrote the following: 'Overall, Americans took 9/11 pretty calmly. Notably, there wasn't a mass outbreak of anti-Muslim sentiment and violence, which all too easily happened. And while GW Bush was a terrible president, to his credit he tried to calm prejudice, not feed it.' 'Daily behaviour wasn't drastically affected. True, for a while people were afraid to fly: My wife and I took a lovely trip to the US Virgin Islands a couple of months later, because air fares and hotel rooms were so cheap. But life returned to normal fairly fast.' Krugman's brazen dismissal of the painful aftermath of the attacks on the Arab and Muslim communities was so hurtful and offensive that I, and many others, felt obliged to respond. Instead of being chastened, the next day Krugman doubled down in yet another series of tweets still trying to make his case that the backlash wasn't as severe as it might have been. He cherry-picked statistics in an effort to show how anti-Muslim hate crimes paled in comparison with anti-Black hate crimes. Because of who he is and the potential impact of what he writes, I cannot let Krugman's whitewashing of the post-9/11 period go unchallenged. Because we must never forget the damage done to my community and to our nation's institutions by Bush administration policies, I need to set the record straight.In the aftermath of the attacks, acts of hatred and death threats were frequent and frightening. My office logged 800 pieces of hate mail and phone messages in just the first few days following 9/11. Only a few hours after the planes hit the World Trade Centre, I received my first death threat. A caller to our office left a message stating, 'Jim, you towel head, all Arabs must die. We will slit your throat and kill your children.' It was the first of many. My daughter and a nephew also received threats, as did my brother John, whose office received two bomb threats. This was just what happened to my family.My office began to receive reports from Arab Americans across the country of threats, harassment, and acts of discrimination. We researched, verified and documented each case. In testimony before the US Commission on Civil Rights, delivered one month after 9/11, I reported the threats of violence and actual acts of violence and harassment committed against my community and those who were perceived to be Arab or Muslim.There were acts of violence against churches, mosques and Arab-owned businesses. Students were harassed, as were cab drivers and even Arab-looking shoppers. In fact, Arab and south Asian cab drivers in DC stopped working for weeks after several cases of harassment and violence by police and passengers. In all, we logged and reported hundreds of cases in just the first 30 days.Equally serious were the hundreds of employment and housing discrimination cases that were reported to us. In numbers of instances people were fired and told that their fellow employees didn't want 'an Arab in the workplace'. We had to hire a specialist to assist these victims.And when airline travel resumed, while the Krugmans were able to enjoy cheap flights to the Virgin Islands, Arab Americans were being subjected to cruel and indiscriminate subjective profiling. They were ordered off planes and denied the right to fly because other passengers claimed the presence of an Arab-looking person made them uncomfortable. Some cases were bizarre. An Arab American congressman was denied a seat on a flight, as was an Arab American secret service agent flying to Texas to join the president's security detail.But these cases tell only part of the story. While Krugman was correct to observe that president George W. Bush cautioned Americans against singling out Arabs and Muslims for blame, he fails to note the extent to which Bush's Department of Justice (DOJ) implemented policies which did exactly that. In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, the DOJ launched a massive round-up of recent Arab and Muslim immigrants, many of whom were summarily deported. The tallies of those deported played out daily on the news creating fear in the community and arousing the suspicion in the general public that 'they must be the problem'.This was followed by two publicised 'call-ins' in which thousands of Arabs and Muslims were contacted by mail and ordered to report for interviews with immigration officials. As a result, there was a very real fear that Arab and Muslim immigrants might be interned as Japanese Americans were during World War II.We were, of course, spared from this fate because so many of our fellow citizens came to our defence, among the first being members of the Japanese American community. The Ad Council of America worked with us to produce newspaper and television ads warning against a backlash. The Senate and House of Representatives passed resolutions defending us. Dozens of civil rights and ethnic organisations, Christian, Jewish, Sikh and Buddhist religious leaders, and unions spoke out on our behalf. And law enforcement agencies offered us protection.But as gratified as we were by this response, nothing can erase the lasting reminders of the fear and the hatred we experienced and the thousands of our fellow Arabs and Muslims whose lives were ruined or forever changed by violence, threats, discrimination, deportation, or just being made to feel alien in their own country.As for Krugman's statistics showing that the increase in anti-Muslim hate crimes was real was still significantly less than those against Blacks, all I can say is 'nonsense'. In the first place, the FBI statistics he cited don't include anti-Arab hate crimes. At the time, the government didn't report them. Second, the firings, denial of housing, etc. aren't considered hate crimes. Third, since the Black community is more than ten times larger than Arab Americans, using this comparison to minimise our pain is both ludicrous and hurtful. Fourth, statistics, of course, don't include harassment by law enforcement, deportations, and other fear-inducing behaviours by government officials. And finally, since hate crimes needed to be reported to the very agencies that were causing wide-spread fear among the community, Arabs were often hesitant to report them. So, Paul Krugman, before you write about this period, speak to us first. Maybe you don't remember what it was like for us, we, on the other hand, can't ever forget.

Nor was there a parade or the great celebration that was expected to be done after the legalization of equal marriage in the country, but this was no impediment to costa Ricans, who from confinement came together to celebrate virtually.
Politicians, activists and nationals of all ages came together virtually, becoming present on the different digital platforms, where they carried out activities, shared messages, publications and, of course, called the foot of the struggle for their rights.
For Enrique Sánchez, deputy of the Citizen Action Party (PAC), the festivities go beyond the parade. ""It is the celebration of being who we are and loving those we love in daylight, without hiding anymore.""
""This year we could not make visible in the streets, because of the pandemic, but we are visible in different virtual celebrations, we are visible in the day to day of all societies and that is a reason for celebration,"" he said.
According to this legislator, the achievements that the country has achieved in this area must serve to seek ultimate equality and that sexually diverse people do not feel fear in the different spaces.
""When Costa Rican society and all the other societies of the world overcome that cultural inequality that allows people to live their continuity with the same happiness that others will have finally achieved a state of equality,"" Sanchez said.
Virtual Diversity March
The March of Diversity or Pride, activity suspended by the emergence of the coronavirus, but that on this Sunday, June 28, International LGBTIQ Pride Day (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, transgender, intersex and queer, was conducted virtually through social networks, where hundreds of viewers connected to broadcasts.
The political quarterback of the march for this year was Patricia Mora, Minister of The Status of Women and executive president of the National Women's Institute (Inamu), who through a video shared her message, calling for love and equality.
""This year I had the honor of being named Marshal of Pride 2020. Because of the situation that the country and the whole planet is going through this time we will not be able to fill the streets of San José with colors, we go virtually, to celebrate pride and to celebrate the entry into force of egalitarian marriage,"" Mora said.
""The time will come when we will go out on the streets again to fill them with colors and happiness, and to tell the world that in this country we respect love in all its manifestations,"" he added.
The virtual activity also designated as a civil society marshal the Lutheran Church of Costa Rica, for the support it has given to the diverse community and egalitarian marriage.
As part of the solidarity activities traditionally carried out in the March, this year a campaign was launched to bring food to people with HIV affected by the pandemic. For them they enabled a compound in the La California neighborhood of San Jose, as well as phone numbers and bank accounts to get help.
Equity towards diversity
The lawyer and activist of sexual diversity, Marco Castillo, recognizes that the situation for equality has advanced in recent years in terms of rights and jurisprudence, but recognizes that there is no way to go.
Among the achievements he rescues is the General Law on HIV-AIDS, the recognition of equal marriage, the affectivity and sexuality programs and some executive projects that have advanced, but for him the challenges go moreThere.
""We feel that we have not achieved equity, it would be an equity that includes not only trans women, who are driven from homes and education and generally has no employment, but also other vulnerable groups are indigenous people, people with disabilities, older adults and other sectors that do not have all rights as citizens,"" he explained.
The activist notes that part of the fight is the lack of a criminalization for crimes for discrimination or hate crimes in the Costa Rican system, as they are facts that happen inside and outside national borders.
""We have to come to respect, there are some arguments that have been used, but in recent times they have rescrusted based on religious fundamentalisms. These are fallacious arguments, in the sense that they are partial and discriminatory interpretations of sacred books and we should not be wrong about that,"" he said.
Victoria Rovira is a Costa Rican who has been fighting as a activist for the rights of trans and sex workers in the country for five years. She recognizes virtual spaces as an opportunity for members of the LGBTIQ community to participate who cannot be present at physical demonstrations.
Rovira recognizes the great challenges facing the population in their struggle for equality and being heard; one of them is to fight so that trans people can take the spaces and themes that belong to them.
""We demand gender recognition of trans people, a trans childhood law that protects minors, we demand comprehensive access to health spaces and protection in workplaces,"" he said.
This activist also insists on the fight for equity must be given to all diverse people. ""If we are to talk about LGBTIQ people let us recognize the youth, the black people, the disabled, the indigenous and our elders that are always very forgotten.
""Let's practice intersectionality (...) this is about the barriers that different groups have that, on top of that have social, cultural or economic implications, that make it harder for them to face life,"" he added.
This June 28, 51 years have been commemorated since the Stonewall riots in New York in a transgender, gay and lesbian group against the New York Police. Since that year each year the date is commemorated internationally."

This was followed by two publicised 'call-ins' in which thousands of Arabs and Muslims were contacted by mail and ordered to report for interviews with immigration officials. As a result, there was a very real fear that Arab and Muslim immigrants might be interned as Japanese Americans were during World War II.
We were, of course, spared from this fate because so many of our fellow citizens came to our defence, among the first being members of the Japanese American community. The Ad Council of America worked with us to produce newspaper and television ads warning against a backlash. The Senate and House of Representatives passed resolutions defending us. Dozens of civil rights and ethnic organisations, Christian, Jewish, Sikh and Buddhist religious leaders, and unions spoke out on our behalf. And law enforcement agencies offered us protection.
But as gratified as we were by this response, nothing can erase the lasting reminders of the fear and the hatred we experienced and the thousands of our fellow Arabs and Muslims whose lives were ruined or forever changed by violence, threats, discrimination, deportation, or just being made to feel alien in their own country.
As for Krugman's statistics showing that the increase in anti-Muslim hate crimes was real was still significantly less than those against Blacks, all I can say is 'nonsense'. In the first place, the FBI statistics he cited don't include anti-Arab hate crimes. At the time, the government didn't report them. Second, the firings, denial of housing, etc. aren't considered hate crimes. Third, since the Black community is more than ten times larger than Arab Americans, using this comparison to minimise our pain is both ludicrous and hurtful. Fourth, statistics, of course, don't include harassment by law enforcement, deportations, and other fear-inducing behaviours by government officials. And finally, since hate crimes needed to be reported to the very agencies that were causing wide-spread fear among the community, Arabs were often hesitant to report them.
 So, Paul Krugman, before you write about this period, speak to us first. Maybe you don't remember what it was like for us, we, on the other hand, can't ever forget.

In a speech on the Senate floor, U.S Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) slammed President Donald Trump’s refusal to condemn white supremacists during the course of last night’s Presidential debate. Durbin also called on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) to bring Durbin’s bill, the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act of 2020, to the floor for a vote. Last week, on a unanimous vote, the U.S House of Representatives passed the House companion to Durbin’s Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act of 2020. The bill would enhance the federal government’s efforts to prevent domestic terrorism by requiring federal law enforcement agencies to regularly assess this threat, focus their resources on the most significant domestic terrorism threats, and provide training and resources to assist state, local, and tribal law enforcement in addressing these threats.
“Like most Americans, I was stunned by the President’s refusal last night to condemn white supremacists during the course of last night’s Presidential debate,” Durbin said. “Trump's comments were quickly embraced by the Proud Boys, an alt-right self-described ‘western chauvinist’ group who clearly viewed it as a call to action. The group immediately turned the President’s words in the debate into a logo that’s been widely circulated on social media.”
Durbin continued, “For years now, in letters, briefings, and hearings, I have repeatedly urged the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of Homeland Security to take a strong stand against the ongoing threat of violent white supremacy and other far-right-wing extremists. Unfortunately, instead of following up with a comprehensive, coordinated effort, to no surprise, the Trump Administration has repeatedly chosen to downplay this deadly threat. A law-and-order President who looks the other way—winks, nods, and says ‘stand by’ to the militia groups and white supremacists.”
Durbin concluded, “Last week, the House of Representatives passed the House companion to my bill—unanimous voice vote. Democrats and Republicans all agreed. Senator McConnell has a chance to take it up. Are we going to stand together as the House did on a bipartisan basis, condemning white supremacists who resort to violence and terrorism? Or are we going to say to them ‘stand back and stand by?’ It’s time for us to step up together on a bipartisan basis.”
Video of Durbin’s remarks on the Senate floor is available here.
Audio of Durbin’s remarks on the Senate floor is available here.
Footage of Durbin’s remarks on the Senate floor is available here for TV Stations.
Since May 2019, Durbin has led two letters to Attorney General Bill Barr and FBI Director Chris Wray, asking what the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the FBI are doing to combat the growing threat of white supremacist violence targeting religious minorities and communities of color. In January, Durbin again pressed DOJ and FBI to take the initiative in leading a coordinated nationwide effort by federal, state, and local law enforcement and intelligence agencies to disrupt and prevent these violent domestic terrorism and hate crime incidents before they take place.
On September 17, FBI Director Christopher Wray testified to Congress that “the top threat we face from domestic violent extremists stems from those we identify as racially/ethnically motivated violent extremists (RMVE)” and that most of these are white supremacists.
According to the Anti-Defamation League, in 2019, domestic extremists killed at least 42 people in the United States in 17 separate incidents. This number makes 2019 the sixth deadliest year on record for domestic extremist-related killings. Last year, a Trump Administration Department of Justice official wrote in a New York Times op-ed that “white supremacy and far-right extremism are among the greatest domestic-security threats facing the United States. Regrettably, over the past 25 years, law enforcement, at both the Federal and State levels, has been slow to respond.”"

Neo-Nazi Nordic Resistance Movement (NRM) launches a string of coordinated actions on Yom Kippur
When: 28 September
Where: Iceland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway
What: The neo-Nazi Nordic Resistance Movement (NRM) organization launched a string of coordinated actions on Yom Kippur targeting Jews in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Iceland. Actions included vandalism at Jewish institutions and the distribution of antisemitic handbills in several Swedish cities, including outside a synagogue in Norrköping, Sweden.
World Jewish Congress President Ronald S. Lauder sharply condemned the blatant expressions of antisemitism on the holiest day of the Jewish calendar, saying: “This Yom Kippur marks the second year in a row that antisemitism has reared its ugly head in Europe. Last year, we saw a murderous antisemitic attack targeting the synagogue in Halle, Germany, and this year, the modern-day successors of the Nazis of the 1930s and 1940s, known as the Nordic Resistance Movement, have mounted a vile and vicious campaign of hate against Jews in Northern Europe.
“The Nordic Resistance Movement represents a violent, racist, antisemitic ideology, and should be outlawed. Perpetrators of this type of incitement against Jews, horrifically disseminated on the most solemn day of the Jewish year, must be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
“On behalf of the World Jewish Congress, I call on all Nordic governments to follow Finland’s example and move swiftly to ban the Nordic Resistance Movement and rid its violent propaganda from our streets. It is the responsibility of governments and law enforcement to ensure that Jewish religious and community institutions have suitable police protection, to enable Jews to practice freely, without intimidation or fear. National parliaments must ensure that there is a suitable legal framework to address all expressions of hate and intolerance. Until the respective governments take these forceful steps, we cannot truly say that we are fighting the scourge of antisemitism.” Click here to read more. Iran Iran

It tells in detail the social climate that is lived in Minneapolis after the crime.
Reflect on racism, class discrimination and solidarity amid chaos.
Eight minutes by car separate Cordoba Florence Artigau from the place where George Floyd was killed days ago. Racism and hate crimes are common currency in America.
Counted from its own perspective, Florence explained in communication with La Voz that unfortunately in that country the videos published on the abuse of power and extreme violence carried out by the police, especially white police towards minorities, are not novelty and are not news. ""This is happening years ago and unfortunately it's very possible that it will continue to happen,"" he said.
What George Floyd, the African-American killed by policemen in the US, died of. USA
The particular thing about Floyd's case is that it is given in broad daylight in front of several civilians, one of whom does a Live streaming on Facebook that of course goes viral in a matter of minutes.
""I daresay we witnessed a murder live. 8 minutes and 46 seconds of a man who is reduced and immobilized not by one, but by three policemen who ignore people's desperate request to let him go,"" said the 30-year-old who lives three years ago in the United States.

We already know that Trump is not a big fan of diversity and colour,"" he said.

Everyday discrimination
""Racial discrimination exists and occurs more in some states than in others,"" said the young woman, who lived in several U.S. states.
As he explained, there is generally more diversity and acceptance in large cities (such as in New York or Los Angeles). ""I lived in New York, California, Utah and now in Minnesota and only once experienced discrimination. I don't miss out on the possibility that this was just a stroke of luck,"" he said.
Demonstrations against racism, following the assassination of Floyd (AP).
Florence explained that in southern states like Alabama or Mississippi, racism is much more pronounced.
""There are many houses that directly have the Confederate flag flying on a mast or hanging on the door. That tells you everything,"" the young lady said.
The Cordoba told a case of discrimination suffered in its own flesh in the years leading up to being based in the United States for her work. On one of his travels, he suffered harassment when he entered that country, because he was Latino.
""It was at the Miami airport. I was put ina little room and they asked me a thousand questions. This happened when I was still studying and I traveled to see some friends. The plan was to start with California and then we'd go skiing. They asked me what my old men were doing and how I had money to travel if I was just a student. When I told them I was lucky enough that my old men could pay for the trip, they said to me, textual words, that 'I had an easy life, and that Mom and Dad weren't always going to be there to save me.' They emptied my bag, asked for my friends' first and last name, and called them to see if my story was real. They asked me why I was bringing so many things if I only came for a couple of weeks, even after I told them I had two bags because one was my ski gear,"" he added.
""I was harassed for half an hour that it felt eternal and when they finally found nothing to incriminate me, they let me go and one of the officers said 'be careful because we're going to be looking at you.' At this point I didn't care about the trip anymore and I wanted to go home. I was in many countries and I never experienced a similar situation,"" he said.
""Discrimination when entering the country is not new. I'm sure a lot of people went from going on vacation for a couple of weeks and being treated like criminals in migrations. Because that's how they make you feel, that you're doing something wrong,"" he said.
As for these kinds of situations, Florence appealed to the internal work that needs to be done every time it happens. ""The important thing is not to let this affect you (although it's difficult) but it's also good to stop by to start understanding how minorities feel every day in this and in many countries.""
Demonstrations against racism, following the assassination of Floyd (AP).
Classist and racist discrimination
Analyzing the current situation in the wake of Floyd's case, Florence differentiated the classist discrimination from the racist, and the difference between Argentina and the United States on this issue.
""I was born and raised in Argentina and have always been treated as an equal in all my fields. I never knew what it was like to be of another race, from another culture or from another country until I moved here. In Argentina it was always everything more, let's say, 'homogeneous' for me. My friends and I are always in similar situations, learnings and experiences, so my evolution as a person was much more horizontal and homogeneous than the one that many minority people lived here,"" he explained.
""This I am about to say seems half played and maybe a lot of people differ, but I can see from here, that Argentina is mostly classist. There is discrimination by skin tone and perhaps with the traits most associated with natives, of course, but I feel that the biggest discrimination is socioeconomic.
Here in the USA there are both. Racial and socio-economic discrimination. If I had been raised here as a person belonging to a minority, I believe that this struggle would touch me much deeper than I do now and understand much more the enormous wounds that black men and women carry with them centuries ago. Being black shouldn't be a death sentence. No black, no Latino, no Asian, no native, nothing. Man, woman, humans. Ready,"" the young lady opined.
Protests in New York over the murder of Floyd (AP).
Weapons, candy
The young woman said that Minneapolis was always a very quiet city: ""Nothing ever happens here and that's why people are terrified of this whole situation. I as an Argentinian are already a little used to it. Coming from a country that is always in crisis helped me develop a special calm for these kinds of storms. I know what looting, riots, protests are like. I don't havefear.""
""What is scary is that here they sell weapons like candy. I assure you that more than half of the citizens of the United States have a personal weapon in their home and there is never a madman missing who opens fire in the middle of the protest.""
Demonstrations against racism, following the assassination of Floyd (AP).
Solidarity that is not news
What the media often doesn't show is the bright side of things. After the nights of destruction came the days of solidarity and collaboration. Every day the citizens of Minneapolis gather at the places where there was damage, looting and protests and help clean up the area. There are donations of food and clothing.
""We on the porch of our house put water, food, clothes and a first aid kit in case someone in the way they need it. They opened an account to donate and rebuild the city and help the small merchants who lost everything to start over. This is the hope that not everything is lost,"" Florence opined.
The coronavirus, time bomb in the background
Another thing that came to the background in the United States is the Covid-19, which still spins silently. In the protests there was no social estrangement, disinfectants, or alcohol in gel.
""A lot of people did wear masks but I doubt this will make a difference. There may be a spike in cases in the coming weeks and hospitals will collapse. I hope I'm wrong,"" he added.
Demonstrations against racism, following the assassination of Floyd (AP).
""The American people are finally awake""
Florence does not let go of its Latin American roots but its long time in the Country led by Trump, forged empathy for that land and its people. ""Beyond fear and uncertainty, it makes me very happy to see that the American people are finally awake. It's time for a reform. It's been a long time since the U.S. ceased to be the free country. Here the free are very few. Health and education are inaccessible. If you study you end up with a huge debt and if you get sick too,"" he opined.
""Discrimination and racism exist. It happens all the time when you see and when you don't see. Front and back. I would like the abuse of the police force to never happen again, but if it happens, I would like the social reaction to be the same and not to matter race, ethnicity, history. What matters is that the person who has to protect you is killing a man in the street for no reason. I would like this enormous sense of solidarity and defence that is being generated in the world to spread and apply to all human beings regardless of the color of their skin,"" she added.
Towards the end of the interview, Florence called everyone to think: ""Be patient, be gentle, be humble. All lives must be valued. If you see that someone is being treated unfairly, protest for them in search of peace and equality. You have to participate and get involved to achieve change. You're still breathing, help others breathe too.""

It started with the national anthem played at the beginning of the game, but I grew more and more uneasy during the seventh-inning stretch. The stretch is a longstanding tradition in baseball, so named because it provides fans weary of sitting through lengthy games a moment to stand up and get their blood moving. A variety of songs have been played during the stretch; famously, broadcaster Harry Caray popularized the singing of ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game"" in the 1970s.
But while the ditty that is Caray's personal favorite is cheerful and nostalgic, the latest seventh-inning stalwart conjures up very different feelings. Playing ""The Star Spangled Banner"" has been a pregame ritual since World War II, and it occasionally makes an appearance during the stretch. But it wasn't until the Sept. 11 attacks, after which Major League Baseball required teams to play ""God Bless America"" during the stretch for the rest of the season, that the stretch became about more than just peanuts and Cracker Jack. At the time, it was a well-received and seemingly unifying gesture. New York baseball fans welcomed it, and the Yankees accordingly rolled out a host of other crowd-pleasing patriotic tributes over the course of the season. But the tradition of singing ""God Bless America"" during the stretch truly made its mark when the 2001 World Series came back to Yankee Stadium and a popular President Bush, who threw out the first pitch to chants of ""USA USA USA,"" looked on while the renowned Ronan Tynan belted it out in the seventh.
Let's fast forward. The end of Bush's tenure saw his support dwindling as the U.S. War on Terror needlessly dragged on. He responded disastrously to Hurricane Katrina and was in office during the beginning of the most significant economic downturn since the Great Depression (at least until the current one). These crises disproportionately affected Black and impoverished Americans. Meanwhile, Ronan Tynan lost his gig at Yankee Stadium in 2009 after admitting that he made anti-Semitic remarks to a Jewish doctor. While 2001's unabashed patriotism was generally perceived as powerful and noble at the time, there were clearly unresolved societal ills lying beneath the surface that, within the decade, would become stark. But these afflictions weren't truly laid bare until the 2016 election, when Donald Trump won the presidency on a nationalistic platform. Post Sept. 11, people came together when faced with a common threat. Trump managed to convince nearly half the country that there was another such threat, a threat as dangerous as a terrorist organization, but far more insidious: it was anyone who wasn't white, Christian and born in the United States.
Hate crimes against Muslims, which skyrocketed after Sept. 11 but stabilized in the following decade, rose again after Trump's election and remained high due to his travel ban and incendiary rhetoric. But while Sept. 11 mainly spurred anti-Muslim attacks, Muslims are just one of many groups that began to face a surge in hate crimes immediately following Trump's election. In 2019, hate crimes reached a 16-year high. Now, the Trump campaign is specifically targeting minorities, especially Black voters who almost uniformly vote Democratic, in their voter suppression efforts, just as they did in the last election by gaining unauthorized access to data on Facebook users.
I maintain that real patriotism is loving everyone in your country equally, listening to all voices and being willing to share that love with anyone who wants to join. Trump's fear-mongering brand of false patriotism has granted him the approval of more than 40 percent of Americans; I am uncomfortable joining in patriotic song with that 40 percent because the divide between our interpretations of the lyrics has grown so large.
Back to that sunny summer day in 2017. Before we saw the highest yearly rate of hate crimes in 16 years. Before Americans' right to vote was being threatened more than ever. Before a corrupt president was exonerated in an impeachment trial that was over before it even began. Before he grossly mishandled a pandemic, costing over 200,000 lives.
We saw the warning signs right away. We immediately resolved to resist in any way we could, and witnessed astronomical numbers of donations and protesters. But on that day in 2017, tired of resisting, the most defiant action I could muster when we rose to listen to ""God Bless America"" was to mutter: ""This is my least favorite part.""
My cousin, standing beside me, overheard and asked why. I began to launch into my scripted rebuke of nationalism, centered around how people are forgetting what happened the last time we allowed it to propagate unfettered. Before I could really get started, however, a man standing in the row in front of me wheeled around, red-faced.
""Don't you dare disrespect this country right now!"" He said, his teeth clenched and finger pointing. Stunned, my face turned a vermillion to match his. Luckily, my father is a lawyer.
""If I'm not mistaken,"" he said calmly, ""what this country stands for is free speech."" The man shook his head and, grumbling to himself, turned back around. The confrontation was over as quickly as it began.
But despite the brevity of the confrontation, I remember the way it made me feel to this day: the initial shock when the man spun around, the embarrassment I then felt at potentially making a scene and my ultimately coming to the conclusion that I should keep thoughts like that to myself, at least in public. Although the memory has stayed with me, the feelings have faded somewhat over time. Meanwhile, the attacks on our democracy from so-called ""patriots"" have only multiplied and grown more urgent. Yet, the Yankees are the only remaining team in baseball to regularly play ""God Bless America"" during the seventh-inning stretch of their home games. Even after not one but two disgraced singers had to be removed. Even as a president from their city wreaks havoc. Even during a pandemic that our country has arguably handled worse than any other.
Written by Irving Berlin, a Jewish immigrant whose family escaped Russian pogroms by fleeing to the United States, ""God Bless America"" was born from good intentions. But when the Yankees' marquee live-performer, Tynan, admitted to denigrating the religion of the very man who wrote it, and the racist past of the singer for their oft-used recorded version came to light, there should have been a real conversation about making significant changes to their seventh-inning routine. Perhaps they will keep the song, but better acknowledge the flaws in this nation while singing it. It would be nice to see gestures like those we saw on opening day this year during the national anthem displayed more consistently and spread to the stretch as well.
Even taking Trump out of the equation though, the Yankees have more than enough reason to implement changes. But in case they need some more, Jews have also been by far the most frequently targeted religious group, if not the most frequently targeted group, in the rash of hate crimes under Trump's watch. This is not the America that Berlin had in mind, but his words are still being used in such a way that downplays attacks on his (and my) religion.
For now, my sights are set on reconsidering the use of ""God Bless America."" But the use of the national anthem is another story. Before Trump was even elected, NFL quarterback-turned-civil-rights-activist Colin Kaepernick had the right idea. He started kneeling or sitting when the anthem was played to protest racial injustice. Shortly after beginning his peaceful protests, Kaepernick appeared on the cover of TIME Magazine, accompanied by a promo video acknowledging the struggle inherent in his attempt to redefine patriotism. It was titled, ""'The Perilous Fight.' That, of course, is a line from our national anthem."" In support of Kaepernick's actions and just a month before the 2016 election, cornerback Richard Sherman noted that ""people are still missing the point...You know, the reason these guys are kneeling and the reason why we're locking arms is to bring people together and make people aware this is not right."" Reassessing the way we sing the anthem is a huge step towards creating a new type of patriotism. Some have even called for leagues to stop playing it entirely. Perhaps that is the solution for right now, but ultimately, I hope to get to a place where we can sing the anthem and maybe even ""God Bless America"" while also acknowledging our nation's faults and working to improve ourselves. This will not be tied up with the blind and fervent nationalism that Donald Trump stands for. It will be linked to a newer, truer kind of patriotism."

Four years ago, when Donald Trump first ran for president, he urged Black people to support him, asking us, ""What have you got to lose?"" 
Four years later, we know exactly what we had to lose. Our lives, as we died in disproportionate numbers from the pandemic he has let flourish among us. Our wealth, as we have suffered disproportionately from the worst economic drop America has seen in 90 years. Our safety, as this president has stood behind those police who kill us in the streets and by the armies of white supremacy who march by night and scheme in the light of day. 
We have learned other things from this president, too. We have learned the names that we say now, over and over again, at each protest, so that no one will forget them. The names Breonna Taylor and George Floyd and Atatiana Jefferson and Stephon Clark and so many more. Such killings did not start with Mr. Trump, of course. But he wants us to forget them. 
If we do, he has offered us a ""Platinum Plan"" for ""Black Economic Empowerment."" The name is appropriate because Mr. Trump is a man who thinks always in terms of financial transactions and deals. A ""Platinum Plan,"" as if he is offering to upgrade our credit card status. The plan, which at two pages is derisively brief, offers us a hodgepodge of things that he thinks we would like. He will prosecute the Ku Klux Klan - and antifa activists - as terrorists. He will make Juneteenth a national holiday and lynching a national hate crime. He will create ""peaceful"" urban, Black neighborhoods, replete with school choice, increased homeownership and the ""highest standards"" of policing. He will begin ""a national clemency project"" designed to ""right wrongful prosecutions"" and ""pardon individuals who have reformed."" 
In his ignorance or his indifference, or perhaps in his contempt, Mr. Trump does not seem to understand the difference between promises made and promises kept. Another Republican president, Ulysses S. Grant, first suppressed the Klan 150 years ago (and notable by its absence is any Trump promise to suppress the right-wing ""militias"" of Michigan, the Proud Boys or any of the others). The United States - finally, belatedly - made lynching a federal crime in the civil rights era, almost 60 years ago. Peaceful neighborhoods with affordable homes, good schools, a police force interested in protecting its citizens instead of treating them as an occupied people; safety from domestic terrorists and mob violence, economic opportunity, the celebration of our heritage, and impartial and merciful treatment under the law - these are the rights that most white people in America have long taken for granted, not some sort of concession to be offered as if we were indeed another nation. 
Too often, the victories we have won have proved to be ephemeral or incomplete, and our full acceptance as Americans has once again been denied. We have learned to trust only those who will stand with us against the worst storms, who have proved themselves to be our friends not out of electoral expediency but through our shared belief in the best principles of this country and our common humanity. 
The polls suggest, we are told, that Mr. Trump has made some small inroads in our vote, that a higher percentage of young Black men will vote for him in 2020 than did in 2016. I have difficulty crediting this. But if it is so, I would urge my brothers to listen better. Not just to the false promises Mr. Trump makes to us, but also at what he says when he is ""alone in the room"" with his white supporters, promising them at his rallies that if he is re-elected, people of color will not invade their ""beautiful suburbs"" from our ""disgusting cities."" 
Mr. Trump is too late. We are everywhere in America. We are in the bone and the blood and the root of the country. We are not going anywhere, certainly not to some fantasy of a new ""separate but equal"" segregation, we in ""our"" cities, white people in ""their"" suburbs. 
Perhaps the president is confused by how the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., in his greatest speech, referred to the words of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution as a ""promissory note to which every American is to fall heir."" Perhaps that gave Mr. Trump the idea that this was all about money. Surely, money - the household stake, the money with which to buy a home, secure a good education, start a family - was a vital goal of the movement then, just as the need for Black people to be made whole, after all the years of slavery and Jim Crow, is still a pressing need today. 
But I was there with Dr. King that day, over a half-century ago, in the shadow of Lincoln's statue, and what he spoke of was ""the riches of freedom and the security of justice."" He quoted the most fundamental promise of the Declaration, that all of us have ""certain unalienable Rights"" - among them ""Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."" 
It seems strange that we must still agitate for these basic rights, or that Mr. Trump thinks he is being magnanimous when he offers them to us again as last-minute campaign promises - so long as we stay in our place. In the past, we have turned the wheel in great bursts of energy and faith, and in between, when we stood exhausted and bloodied, there was some sliding back. That is always how it is in a democracy and a people's movement, but now is the time to move forward again. 
Four years ago, faced with the prospect of a Trump presidency, I wrote that what old men know is how quickly things can change. Well, I am still old but I am also still here, at 93, and for all the bitter lessons we have learned from Mr. Trump's term in office, I can tell you that the wheel is turning again. That we have never had so many white allies, willing to stand together for freedom, for honor, for a justice that will free us all in the end, even those who are now most fearful and seething with denial. 
We have learned exactly how much we had to lose - a lesson that has been inflicted upon Black people again and again in our history - and we will not be bought off by the empty promises of the flimflam man.

The story byGillian R. Brassil[2]andJer Longman[3] on Tuesday is mostly supportive of transgenders competing with opposite-gender sports and cites some dubious sources.The Times' analysis contains seven highly debatable points.1. ""(S)cientific and societal views of sex and gender identity have changed significantly in recent decades.""This is incorrect. Biological science is not a ""view"" and has not changed, no matter how often LGBT advocates claim it has.2. ""The Trump administration and some states have sought to roll back protections for transgender people in health care, the military and other areas of civil rights, fueling a rise in hate crimes, according to theHuman Rights Campaign[4].""The HRC, one of the most powerful and well-funded LGBT pressure groups, is presented as a credible source on this?
 Get real!3. A new Idaho law banning males in women's sports was passed this spring, and the ACLU challenged it in federal court, claiming it violated equal protection guaranteed by the 14th Amendment to the Constitution. Ah, the good old 14th Amendment is typically the Left's go-to amendment used to defend specious arguments, such as abortion (in the Roe v. Wade decision by SCOTUS).4. ""Chief U.S. District Judge David C. Nye temporarily halted the (Idaho) law on Monday,writing in an 87-page injunction[5]that a 'categorical bar to girls and women who are transgender stands in stark contrast to the policies of elite athletic bodies that regulate sports both nationally and globally.' ' Is this judge really deferring to the leftists at the NCAA and International Olympic Committee to determine U.S. law? Yes, and the NYT does not find this form of judicial jujitsu objectionable.5. ""Scientists have long said there isno single biological factor[6]that determines sex, and the sex assigned at birth is not considered the sole determinant of gender."" Just where would the above link take NYT readers? To the pro-trans story ""Why Sex Is Not Binary"" by Anne Fausto-Sterling -- a gender studies professor at the Ivy League's Brown University. Fausto-Sterling argues, ""It has long been known that there is no single biological measure that unassailably places each and every human into one of two categories male or female."" Known by LGBT activists and their media lackeys, that is.6. ""Guidelines regarding transgender athletes represent 'sport's unsolvable problem,' said Ross Tucker, a South African exercise physiologist who is helping World Rugby develop its eligibility rules."" Tucker says it is impossible to balance the values of competitive fairness, inclusion and safety. No, this ""problem"" is very solvable. Men should man-up and compete in men's sports.7. ""Contrary to fears expressed by some, there has been no large-scale dominance of transgender athletes in women's sports."" Talk about defeating your own argument, the Times writers mention world champion cyclist Rachel McKinnon, a man dominating a women's sport, and Cece Telfer[7] (the dude who does not look like a lady, seen towering over real women in above photo), a man dominating women's college track and field. The Times mentions a researcher's estimation that 0.00025 percent of college athletes are transgender, begging the questions ""Why are we having these arguments when only a tiny percentage of athletes are suffering gender confusion?"" and ""Why are men allowed to take scholarships away from female athletes?""BrassilandLongman do make some concessions to biological realities, again defeating their earlier contentions.They acknowledge evidence suggesting ""residual strength and muscle mass advantages largely remain when people assigned as males at birth undergo testosterone suppression for a year."" Men and women mostly compete in separate divisions because males have ""larger skeletal structure, greater muscle mass and strength, less body fat, greater bone density, larger hearts and greater oxygen-carrying capacity.""Also, a 2019Swedish study[8]of 11 transgender women reported that a year of testosterone suppression resulted in a ""negligible decrease in strength"" in trans men's thigh muscles and muscle mass.Give biology yet another victory over the social engineers and their media friends.

(AP) — The U.S. Congress is once again at an impasse over a widely backed bill to designate lynching as a federal hate crime. And as in previous attempts to pass anti-lynching legislation, the proposal is being blocked by a white southern representative this time, U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky.
Merriam-Webster defines lynching as “to put to death (as by hanging) by mob action without legal approval or permission.” Throughout American history, lynching has been used as a tool of terror against people of color to maintain racist social orders and prevent people of color from voting, asserting human rights or seeking employment. Black, Native American and Mexican American activists have sought for more than a century for federal legislation aimed at ending the practice and imposing harsh penalties for it.
Here’s a look at how lynching evolved in the U.S. as populations of color grew and demanded civil rights:
BEGINNINGS
Almost as soon as European settlers came to the present-day United States, white mobs attacked peaceful Native American villages. Black slaves who revolted faced death and, at times, slave owners and overseers, could kill a slave without fear of much punishment.
Though debated, some historians say the country’s first lynching took place in St. Louis.
On April 28, 1836, Francis McIntosh, a free black steward, disembarked of the steamboat Flora and onto a levee, according to “The Broken Heart of America: St. Louis and the Violent History of the United States” by Walter Johnson. He walked into town but was overtaken by two sailors running from the police. Deputy Sheriff George Hammons and Deputy Constable William Mull abandoned their chase of the sailors and took an innocent McIntosh into custody. He was eventually burned to death. Two years later, a young lawyer named Abraham Lincoln denounced McIntosh’s lynching and called it a threat to the Republic.
__
JIM CROW ERA
Following Reconstruction and the withdraw of federal troops from the American South, newly freed black slaves fell victim to lynchings by white mobs who blamed them for the South’s economic troubles. A paramilitary group known as the Ku Klux Klan attracted former Confederate soldiers who attacked African Americans. In 1866, a dispute between white and black Civil War ex-soldiers in Memphis, Tennessee, resulted in blacks’ lynchings by white mobs and police. Two months later, a white mob lynched 37 blacks attending a suffrage convention in New Orleans.
States in the former Confederacy passed laws preventing black men from voting and used the threat of lynching to halt objections. But lynchings also were used to enforce racial segregation and prevent African American economic advancement.
Often black men and women were taken from their homes at night and beaten before public lynchings. From 1882 to 1968, more than 4,700 lynchings were recorded in the U.S., according to the NAACP, the oldest civil rights group in the country founded in response to lynchings. About 70% of those lynched were black.
Photos of blacks being lynched later appeared on postcards with racist poems or words. The images often included a black mutilated body hanging from a tree while smiling whites, sometimes with children, looked at the corpse.
THE WEST
Mexican Americans after the U.S. Civil War became victims of lynching by white mobs in Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, and California as white settlers tried to impose their own racist social order in land taken from Mexico. In towns, villages, and cities in the West, Mexican Americans were subjected to torture, lynchings and other violence at the hands of white mobs and law enforcement agencies such as the Texas Rangers. Historians say that from 1910 to 1920, an estimated 5,000 people of Mexican descent were killed or vanished in the U.S.
Often the violence was so barbaric it attracted the attention of newspapers abroad and the fledgling NAACP.
Asian Americans also faced lynchings in California. Jean Pfaelzer’s 2008 book “Driven Out: The Forgotten War against Chinese Americans” documents from 1848 into the 20th Century how lawless white mobs attacked Chinese miners and workers in California and the Pacific Northwest in violent acts of ethnic cleansing. If the victims weren’t forcibly loaded onto railroad cars, they were lynched.
In 1930, Robert B. Martin, a local lumber worker and Filipino veteran of World War I, was found hanging in a tree in Susanville, California. His crime: he had been seen talking to white women.
FIGHTING BACK
Journalist Ida B. Wells led an anti-lynching crusade in the late 1800s by writing about murdered African Americans, even risking her life by traveling to the South to investigate stories. She brought her campaign to the White House in 1898 and called for President William McKinley to make reforms.
Between 1920 and 1938, the NAACP flew a flag outside its New York City headquarters every time it received another lynching report. Meanwhile, the group tried to seek state and federal anti-lynching legislation — proposals that always faced fierce opposition from politicians from the American South.
In 2018, the Equal Justice Initiative, a Montgomery-based legal advocacy group, opened the nation’s first memorial and museum to lynching victims. The organization said 650,000 people have visited the memorial and museum since the sites opened.
Last month, an online video emerged showing the February 23 shooting death of unarmed 25-year-old black man Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia by two white assailants. Rev. James Woodall, state president of the Georgia NAACP, called the unprovoked killing of Arbery, who was jogging, a “modern-day lynching.”

NEW YORK, Sept 28 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Lesbian, gay and bisexual people are much more likely than straight people to get migraines, U.S. research showed on Monday, indicating sexual orientation may be a risk factor for the painful and disabling headaches.
Nearly one third of lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) participants experienced migraines, 58% more than did heterosexual participants, in a survey by the University of California - San Francisco (UCSF) published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Neurology.
Overall, more than one in six people in the United States experience migraine headaches, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Severe headache pain from migraines, one of the most common reasons for a hospital emergency room visit, can be accompanied by sensitivity to light and sound as well as blurred vision, nausea and vomiting.
The researchers said while their work shows LGB Americans are at greater risk for migraines, they could not pinpoint the reasons why.
""There might be a higher rate of migraines in LGB people because of discrimination, stigma or prejudice, which may lead to stress and trigger a migraine,"" the study's lead author Dr. Jason Nagata, an assistant professor of pediatrics at UCSF, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
""Physicians should be aware that migraines are quite common in LGB individuals and assess for migraine symptoms,"" Nagata said.
Hate crimes against LGBT+ people have slightly risen in recent years, according to the most recent data from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation.
There was a total of 1,130 reported crimes based on sexual orientation in the United States from 2014 to 2017. The majority of the incidents targeted gay men.
LGB people may be at higher risk for migraines also due to barriers of receiving health care, Nagata added.
Migraines can be disabling and result in missed work and frequent doctor visits.
Other studies have shown disparities in migraine prevalence by gender, ethnicity and socioeconomic status.
As many as 85% of Americans who suffer from migraines are women, according to the Migraine Research Foundation, a U.S. based nonprofit that researches migraine treatments.
Migraines appear to be more common among Black Americans and Americans with lower socioeconomic status, according to the National Headache Foundation, a U.S. based nonprofit that raises awareness about headache and migraine pain.
The new study surveyed nearly 10,000 Americans ages 31 to 42 from 2016 to 2018.

Getting a COVID-19 vaccine to the right people could change the course of the pandemic in the United States. But who are the right people?
As the decision looms for President-elect Joe Biden's incoming administration, a new analysis argues for targeting the first vaccines to the same low-income Black, Hispanic and Native American households that have disproportionately suffered from the coronavirus. But no one at the federal level has committed to the idea, which would be a significant shift from the current population-based method adopted by Operation Warp Speed.
“It’s not just a math problem. It’s a question of implementing a major social justice commitment,” said Harald Schmidt, a medical ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania, who compared the strategies with colleagues from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Boston College. The Associated Press conducted an independent analysis of the findings and worked with the team to estimate how many disadvantaged people would benefit.
If the shots get to the right people, Schmidt argues, the benefits could extend to the entire nation: Fewer people would get sick, hospital capacity would improve and more of the economy could reopen. Lives would be saved.
In October, a panel advising the federal government suggested setting aside 10% of the vaccine supply to distribute as an extra boost to the states with greater shares of disadvantaged groups. But the idea from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine has been largely ignored.

States plan for vaccines as daily US virus deaths top 3,100
States drafted plans Thursday for who will go to the front of the line when the first doses of COVID-19 vaccine become available later this month, as U.S. deaths from the outbreak eclipsed 3,100 in a single day, obliterating the record set last spring.
With initial supplies of the vaccine certain to be limited, governors and other state officials are weighing both health and economic concerns in deciding the order in which the shots will be dispensed.
States face a Friday deadline to submit requests for doses of the Pfizer vaccine and specify where they should be shipped, and many appear to be heeding nonbinding guidelines adopted this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to put health care workers and nursing home patients first.
But they're also facing a multitude of decisions about other categories of residents — some specific to their states; some vital to their economies.
Colorado’s draft plan, which is being revised, puts ski resort workers who share close quarters in the second phase of vaccine distribution, in recognition of the $6 billion industry’s linchpin role in the state's economy.

Wisconsin high court declines to hear Trump election lawsuit
MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A divided Wisconsin Supreme Court on Thursday refused to hear President Donald Trump’s lawsuit attempting to overturn his loss to Democrat Joe Biden in the battleground state, sidestepping a decision on the merits of the claims and instead ruling that the case must first wind its way through lower courts.
In another blow to Trump, two dissenting conservative justices questioned whether disqualifying more than 221,000 ballots as Trump wanted would be the proper remedy to the errors he alleged.
The defeat on a 4-3 ruling was the latest in a string of losses for Trump’s post-election lawsuits. Judges in multiple battleground states have rejected his claims of fraud or irregularities.
Trump asked the Wisconsin Supreme Court to disqualify more than 221,000 ballots in the state’s two biggest Democratic counties, alleging irregularities in the way absentee ballots were administered. His lawsuit echoed claims that were earlier rejected by election officials in those counties during a recount that barely affected Biden’s winning margin of about 20,700 votes.
Trump’s attorney Jim Troupis said he would immediately file the case in circuit court and expected to be back before the Supreme Court “very soon.”

Biden eyes defeated candidates for key administration roles
DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — In politics, there can sometimes be an upside to losing.
President-elect Joe Biden is eyeing several Democrats who lost congressional reelection races last month for key positions in his administration. They include outgoing Reps. Abby Finkenauer of Iowa and Donna Shalala of Florida and Sen. Doug Jones of Alabama.
Their consideration continues a long Washington tradition of defeated politicians seeking shelter in a new White House. Landing a job in a new administration can both position the losing candidates for future campaigns and provide the incoming president with important relationships on Capitol Hill.
“It's good to have people who know how to roam the halls of Congress,” said Andrew Card, who directed George W. Bush's transition and later served as the Republican president's chief of staff.
Biden's transition team declined to comment on the prospects of any individual contender for an administration role. He has already unveiled much of his economic and national security team and is expected to announce picks soon for key health positions.

Trump aide banned from Justice after trying to get case info
WASHINGTON (AP) — The official serving as President Donald Trump’s eyes and ears at the Justice Department has been banned from the building after trying to pressure staffers to give up sensitive information about election fraud and other matters she could relay to the White House, three people familiar with the matter tell The Associated Press.
Heidi Stirrup, an ally of top Trump adviser Stephen Miller, was quietly installed at the Justice Department as a White House liaison a few months ago. She was told within the last two weeks to vacate the building after top Justice officials learned of her efforts to collect insider information about ongoing cases and the department’s work on election fraud, the people said.
Stirrup is accused of approaching staffers in the department demanding they give her information about investigations, including election fraud matters, the people said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter.
The effort came as Trump continues to level baseless claims that he won the election and alleges without evidence that massive voting fraud was responsible for his defeat to President-elect Joe Biden.
Stirrup had also extended job offers to political allies for positions at some of the highest levels of the Justice Department without consulting any senior department officials or the White House counsel's office and also attempted to interfere in the hiring process for career staffers, a violation of the government's human resources policies, one of the people said.

Fatal shooting of Black teen roils liberal town in Oregon
SALEM, Ore. (AP) — The killing of a young Black man last month by a white man who complained that he was playing loud music has roiled Ashland, Oregon, forcing the liberal college town that is famous for its Shakespeare festival to take a hard look at race relations.
The death of Aidan Ellison, 19, added another name to the list of Black men and women whose killings have sparked a nationwide reckoning with racism and fueled a surge in a Black Lives Matter movement.
“What can be said about this teenager who was full of spirit? He was just getting started on his lifelong journey when he was taken from us,” Ellison’s mother, Andrea Wofford, said in a statement. “Enough is enough. How many Black men have to die before this community takes hate crimes seriously?”
On Nov. 23, Robert Keegan fired a single shot into Ellison's chest after complaining about the music late at night in a motel parking lot. He is being held without bail after pleading not guilty to second-degree murder, manslaughter and other charges.
Keegan, 47, is from the nearby small town of Talent, which was heavily damaged in a wildfire in September. He and Ellison were both staying at the motel but apparently did not know each other before that night.

VIRUS TODAY: State action on vaccine, virus relief package
Here's what's happening Thursday with the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S.:
THREE THINGS TO KNOW TODAY
— States are crafting plans that decide who should be at the front of the line for a COVID-19 vaccine and where the doses should be shipped once the federal government provides emergency authorization, which could happen as early as next week. State officials are prioritizing groups such as nursing home residents and staff members, front-line health care workers and first responders.
— An analysis argues for targeting the first vaccines to the same low-income Black, Hispanic and Native American households that have disproportionately suffered from the coronavirus. The federal government is taking a different approach, allocating the vaccine to states based on population.
— House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell had a telephone conversation about an end-of-year virus relief package, providing a sign that a stalemate could be broken in gridlocked Washington.

In some parts of New York, vote count shrouded in secrecy
ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — Policies favoring secrecy over transparency have meant that New Yorkers will be among the last Americans to learn the final vote tallies in the 2020 election, with results in a few races still unknown one month after Election Day.
Several of the locally run elections boards responsible for processing a record 2 million absentee ballots cast in the state decided not to release any rolling updates on how their count of those mail-in votes was progressing until the very last vote was tallied.
While elections officials in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Arizona and Nevada updated the public daily on how their count of the mail-in vote was going, their counterparts in some parts of New York maintained radio silence, and refused all media requests for information as to how the vote was unfolding.
“The country was looking down their noses at Pennsylvania, Georgia for taking so long,” said Senate Deputy Majority Leader Michael Gianaris. “New York makes them look good. We are the last in the nation in terms of finishing our vote counts and it’s an embarrassment that would have been more widely known were we at play in the presidential election.”
New York City's Board of Elections kept information about its count of more than 662,000 absentee ballots secret until Tuesday. As of Thursday, Suffolk County, on the eastern end of Long Island, still hadn't given any public updates on its tally of more than 160,000 absentee ballots.

Wind fans wildfire in California canyons, residents flee
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Powerful gusts pushed flames from a wildfire through Southern California canyons on Thursday, one of several blazes that burned near homes and forced residents to flee amid elevated fire risk for most of the region that prompted utilities to cut off power to hundreds of thousands.
The biggest blaze began late Wednesday as a house fire in Orange County's Silverado Canyon, where gusts topped 70 mph (113 kph).
“When crews arrived it was a fully engulfed house and the winds were extremely strong and they pushed flames into the vegetation,” said Colleen Windsor, a spokeswoman for the county's Fire Authority.
The fire grew to more than 11 square miles (29 square kilometers) and blanketed a wide area with smoke and ash.
Crews struggled in steep terrain amid unpredictable Santa Ana winds that sent flames racing across major roads. Two firefighters were hospitalized after being injured on the fire lines, the Fire Authority said on Twitter without offering additional details.

Theater uses its creativity to defy pandemic and stage shows
NEW YORK (AP) — There's theater on Broadway. You just have to adjust your sights.
More than a hundred blocks north of Manhattan's shuttered theater district but on that same famed thoroughfare, an actor recently read his lines from a huge stage.
But there was no applause. Instead, all that was heard was a strange command for the theater: “And cut!”
Tony Award-winner Jefferson Mays was performing multiple roles for a high-tech “A Christmas Carol” that was being filmed for streaming this month at the empty 3,000-seat United Palace.
The one-man show is an example of how many who work in theater are increasingly defying COVID-19 by refusing to let it stop their art, often creating new hybrid forms."

In some ways, the industry's long-standing emphasis on European designers has kept Latinx creators out of the spotlight, but there's a shift underway, according to Maria Cornejo.
""Before there was just the usuals, Oscar de la Renta, Carolina and of course Narciso [Rodriguez] who I love, but now there seems to be a whole new wave of designers coming out of Latin America,"" she told WWD. ""When I was a child, everything was looking to Europe and looking to the States. I feel like as Latin countries take more pride in their own designers, then they would get noticed everywhere else.""
Latinx designers work across a wide range of boundaries - cultural differences, language barriers and geographical constraints. These challenging juxtapositions and complexities often result in new perspectives to solving design problems. And despite the sluggishness to adapt Latinx designers into the current fashion industry in the U.S., the community is expected to wield increased influence in the coming years.
In looking at what has changed for Latinx designers over the years, WWD spoke to Cornejo, an established and sustainable fashion trailblazer and designer of Zero + Maria Cornejo, and emerging designer Barbara Sánchez-Kane of the binary defying brand Sánchez-Kane. Each offered unique views on the industry through a Latinx lens, as they tackled issues spanning the current racial climate, discrimination based on their ethnicities, and the opportunities for Latinx designers in the future of fashion.
Maria Cornejo
Brand: Zero + Maria Cornejo
Maria Cornejo was born in Chile and went to England as a political refugee in 1975. She studied fashion there before moving to Paris in 1988. Over the years, she worked in Japan, China and Italy, and ultimately moved to New York City in 1996 at age 35. Two years later, Cornejo started Zero + Maria Cornejo on Mott Street.
WWD: What made you choose a career in fashion design and how did the journey begin for you?
Maria Cornejo: I chose to do fashion, when I first arrived in England I was 12 years old, I couldn't speak English, I felt like I was drowning. You know you can't speak the language, but visually I felt much more confident in doing things in art. My art teacher kept encouraging me to go into the arts, whereas my chemistry teacher kept encouraging me to go to chemistry. So I have a very mathematical mind, which I didn't realize at the time. I wasn't confident enough because my English wasn't good enough. But as I got older I realized that I ended up using math every day, calculation and the way I cut things is in the way of geometry. It's interesting how I ended up in fashion because when I was a child my grandmother and mother, they all made their clothes and I was taught to knit by my grandmother when I was seven on giant construction nails because, in those days there were no children's knitting needles. I knitted my dolls, made them outfits like a typical kid who loves fashion. I didn't realize it could be a career, I just thought it was something that I always just did, and then as I got older I realized that's what I wanted to do.
WWD: Was there a key person who helped get you your first opportunity/took a chance on you in the industry?
M.C.: For me, I worked from the age of 15 in fashion stores in Manchester, and there was this amazing lady called Maureen Doherty, who used to run the stores called: Elle, Issey Miyake and Fiorucci. And so I was like a Saturday girl, she always encouraged me, with my mad outfits and she used to say to me, ""I don't care, go for a walk if you're bored, but you know just be interested in things,"" and she was really amazing and she's still going, she's got her own collection called ""Egg"" in London. She does really well and she was one of the first people to introduce Margiela into England and things like that, she's just really an interesting person because she's very creative and at the same time she had the eye, she had a great eye, and I think she saw that in me.
WWD: Not all designers are afforded the same opportunities. What have been some milestone moments for your brand and for you as a designer?
M.C.: I think for me a milestone was when I graduated from college. Joseph Ettedgui, who owns all the Joseph stores and this other store ""Whistles,"" bought my college collection, which was incredible, when I was 21. When I was 23, with my boyfriend at the time, John Richmond, we launched 20 of our stores in Japan, Richmond Cornejo, which is pretty amazing for a 23-year-old to have 20 own stores. We designed them, did everything in them, and I was shuffling between Tokyo and Milan all the time, and London. Winning the Cooper Hewitt design awards in 2006, in 2019 winning the Fashion Group International's sustainability award, and the CFDA Lexus Award years ago - all these things have been big milestones. Amazing things happening, like Michelle Obama wearing the clothes, and all these incredible women who support the brand.
WWD: Do you find your Latinx heritage influences your thought process when creating a collection?
M.C.: Yes, I definitely think it informs certain collections. Like one collection could be more colorful, and I think my Latin roots and my sense of joy and color come from South America. And fun, Latins are quite fun, we don't take ourselves too seriously. Even though people think I'm very serious, I'm not. I grew up all over the place and to me what I take away from being Latin is the heart, the color, the soul, things that are really important right now.
WWD: What are your thoughts on the current climate regarding race in the U.S. and how it impacts the Hispanic/Latinx community?
M.C.: That's a big question, my gosh! For me, I've always been a foreigner, one of the reasons I love New York...it's such a mixed-race city, and it's so diverse and dynamic because of that. You hear Spanish, you hear the bodegas, you hear the people, the music and everything. Whereas, when I lived in Europe, I was very exotic, I was the only Latin in art school in London, so coming here I felt like home, but yeah there's a lot of inequalities with women, people [of color]. I was saying to someone the other day, I am not only [a person of color], I am Hispanic, and I'm a woman and I'm also older, so there's so many disparities - financial and socio-economical. As immigrants we work harder than anybody else to make things work. Nothing was given to us.
WWD: Have you ever faced discrimination in your career because of your ethnicity? 
M.C.: I've had more discrimination because of being a girl. Some of the powers that be are not very girl-friendly, they would rather have a gay guy talking to them. And I'm also very straight-forward, maybe that's just me, if anything it'd be more about that. A lot of the people that have really supported me in this business, apart from a few female friends, and of course my business partner, have been male and they have been gay. I can't honestly say that I've had real discrimination.
I never thought about it, i just thought maybe my limitations, I didn't arrive with a trust fund to start a business, I started it from scratch so it could only be what it could be, and it grew organically. Other people that came into this business have had financial backing, I decided not to have financial backing, I decided I wanted to keep control of what I was doing, so it's hard for me to say that it was racial. I think it's also having to do with my own path that I just took. But I think Latins, we definitely have been very quiet about our talents, and I think, more than ever now, it's a good time to sort of speak up and be counted. We've always apologized for walking through the room more or less.
WWD: How do you think things have or haven't changed for Hispanic/Latinx designers in the last 10 or 20 years?
M.C.: Because of Karla Martinez going to Vogue Mexico, I think she did an amazing job and really spotlighted everything that's amazing about Latin culture in fashion, I think that's a big shift. Before there was just the usuals, Oscar de la Renta, Carolina and of course Narciso [Rodriguez] who I love, but now there seems to be a whole new wave of designers coming out of Latin America. When I was a child, everything was looking to Europe and looking to the States. I feel like as Latin countries take more pride in their own designers then they would get noticed everywhere else. The problem is a lot of Latin countries, the only people that would get a look in would be like Oscar de la Renta and Carolina Herrera because they were based in New York, but [Latin countries] weren't looking after their local talent, and with many local talents there wasn't enough of a business there to carry it. Of course they want fashion from everywhere but they're also very aware of what they'll try and have back home.
To be honest, it's so much about exposure, Instagram and the Internet have sort of evened out the playing field that everybody can have a voice somehow, it doesn't guarantee sales, but at least you can put your image out there and I think that's sort of given a lot of people and other designers more opportunity.
WWD: What do you see for the future of your brand?
M.C.: It's not an easy time right now, so we are trying to edit things down. We have our loyal clients that we are listening to and that's how we keep going, and being more and more sustainable every day. That's all we can do for now. With me, I'm a bit of a dreamer, I dream big but then expect the worst, so somewhere in the middle it will fold. We're really loving right now all the things that, originally, the brand started with, which is the denim, T-shirts, it's going back to its roots, which i'm really excited about because that feels much more natural to me, to my way of lifestyle and of the women that I know, making interesting clothing that is for every day and it's not just going to sit in their wardrobe two more months.
WWD: Do you have any words of wisdom that you can share for the next generation of Hispanic/Latinx designers who are trying to break into the industry?
M.C.: Keep it small, keep it real and keep it original. In order for anybody to survive you have to be an original right now because there are a lot of copies, they can make things cheaper, all the high street brands copy everything. So, in order to survive you need to have your own point of view and be creative with less, and be sustainable. Have passion for it, you have to be in it for the long haul and that's, I think, that's the thing. Everybody expects instant success, and there's no such thing. When you realize you spend most of your life, your awake life, whether it's doing accounting, or a doctor, you have to be passionate about what you do, otherwise what's the point?
The older I get, the more Latin I feel, and I think one of the things I am is, I'm very New York, I'm very much a mutt after living everywhere and New York is the best place to be right now.
 
Barbara Sánchez-Kane
Brand: Sánchez-Kane
Barbara Sánchez-Kane was born in the south of Mexico, in Merida (Yucatan). The fashion designer and visual artist spent her whole life there before moving to Mexico City two years ago. In 2016, Sánchez-Kane started the namesake brand, which has now evolved beyond fashion to art installations, performances, painting, sculpting and poetry. 
WWD: What made you choose a career in fashion design and how did the journey begin for you?
Barbara Sánchez-Kane: First of all, I studied industrial engineering in Mexico. You graduate when you are around 22 or 23 years old in Mexico, so six months after graduation I was feeling bad health wise, I was checked out by my doctor and they found out I had ovarian cancer when I was 22. That literally was the best thing that could happen to me - I know it sounds very strange saying it - but it was detected in time and just hearing that word for me was literally a slap in the face, like what am I doing with my life? In Mexico, artistic careers are not that well supported because [your parents] feel, ""well how are you going to make money?"" Nor fashion or art, they don't encourage that much those types of careers, so that's why I studied engineering. But that changed my life, it's also when I told my parents that I was gay, I want to study fashion, let's change everything. With fashion, it made me feel more comfortable showing creativity at that point, and with fashion it led to discovering new mediums and that's how I keep doing it. I want to do or start things like welding, or painting, now I want to take ceramics. Prueba y error [trial and error], when you find a new medium it gives you different answers, maybe the same questions but different answers at a certain point in time. I think it's very important to find what makes you tick.
WWD: Was there a key person who helped get you your first opportunity/took a chance on you in the industry?
B.S.K.: For me, the support of my parents has been the pivot point, if it wasn't for them I wouldn't be here talking to you about this. A very important person in my life that helped me develop the brand and the shows [which give you the DNA of Sánchez-Kane] is Monse Castera, a very good friend. She's in Mexico, and is the producer of almost all my shows, she has trusted me since the start. When I moved to Mexico City, for me it was kind of backwards. A lot of people either think I'm American or I'm Mexican and they ask ""well do you live in New York or Mexico?"" Sometimes even the Mexicans think I'm American, so you are sometimes floating in between, having to clarify that I grew up in Mexico and I've lived in Merida. For me at the beginning in Mexico I remember I used to send mails when I graduated and nobody answered, but then I presented my collection in the States with V-Files, it was the first show I did in New York in September, and then after I have this Mexican star writing me back saying ""oh, you're Mexican, blah blah blah,"" but Monse Castera has trusted me since the start, and keeps pushing me. Every time I have an idea, even the craziest idea, she gets it. Sometimes creative people have ideas and she makes me create them and put them out into the world, she's very important.
WWD: Not all designers are afforded the same opportunities. What have been some milestone moments for your brand and for you as a designer?
B.S.K.: Presenting in New York with V-Files opened my eyes, in a good and bad way. The fashion industry is not the warmest place of all. I remember I was very anxious, I had just started the brand, sometimes you don't trust what you want to say because there's a lot of voices, and I remember when I was in New York it was very overwhelming. There was production and it was the first time I saw models, makeup themes, and here you are the designer and you have all these ideas, but people are going to try to change it. It was the first time I understood that I needed to put my feet on the ground and say, I'm here because they saw something in me, so I'm going to give you just that, don't try to change me. 
WWD: Do you find your Latinx heritage influences your thought process when creating a collection?
B.S.K.: Completely. It's what I know, it's not like I need to study it, it's what I surround myself in, what I eat, what I smell. It's just a whole world and it keeps going. We have a lot of culture and heritage, for me it's what I know, what I live, and for me it's very important to be organic in the process. I've never been interested to investigate another culture when my culture has so much to offer and beyond. I didn't even think it - it's organic, that's the word...I remember in Los Angeles I went to the piñata district, and it looked more Mexican because they wanted to showcase it more, so this combination in Mexico it's probably a bit more toned down, but in L.A. it's known as the piñata district. I think Latino designers and the community - I was talking to Willy Chavarria last year in Las Vegas, and we talked about the Latino models in New York, it's amazing, it gives you more power and more courage to show the colors of your skin, speak your voice, how not to hide your identity, that, too, is super important.
WWD: What are your thoughts on the current climate regarding race in the U.S. and how it impacts the Hispanic/Latinx community?
B.S.K.: Because there are a lot of hate crimes, the El Paso shooting, so many bad things that have happened in the past year, that the Latino community have been targeted, literally, for their heritage, there is a climate of fear. Imagine not wanting to speak Spanish in public because you are afraid someone will say, ""This is America, you speak English in this country."" It's scary. I don't live in the U.S. but seeing the news, hearing stories from friends, I'm not there and I can't say 100 percent, but hiding your identity and suppressing it, the ICE detention centers, the cages, it looks like a f-king mad world. This has always happened, and with social media it's good that it's there to some degree, everyone can see what's happening in real time in the U.S. or in Mexico, Europe. It's not just a problem in the U.S., it's a worldwide problem, hatred, a global f-king pandemic.
WWD: Have you ever faced discrimination in your career because of your ethnicity? 
B.S.K.: Not necessarily, maybe more because of my sexual orientation. Mexico is a very macho-dominated mentality, so having a woman designing men's clothes, it comes charged with a lot of rule breaking. We are a very religious country and here you are trying to break what I like to call The Macho Sentimental, a new human that is not afraid of speaking, being queer, feminine, or being more masculine above all. For this I have been criticized a little bit - more in Mexico because it's a very conservative country.
WWD: How do you think things have or haven't changed for Hispanic/Latinx designers in the last 10 or 20 years?
B.S.K.: Speaking with Willy Chavarria, we have a camaraderie, we support each other, since there are not millions of Latino designers, and again the visualization of the Latinx community in fashion shows, campaigns, has gone up in the past years. Body positiveness, it's good that you can see a model and then a kid might go ""the color of my skin, my ethnicity, my background, is fucking amazing,"" instead of being ashamed of where you come from. Even if you are a third-generation Mexican in the U.S., you show it, you're proud of it. It's amazing, when a young kid came up to me in New York, he was about 17 or 18, he came to model, he didn't end up being in my show, but I remember him telling me ""It feels amazing that I can go and be casted for Sánchez-Kane,"" to feel identified. And, for me, that was amazing. When I do casting everyone sort of becomes like family, friends, and you see how it evolves. I like to keep it warm and familiar when it comes to my shows and the backstage.
WWD: What do you see for the future of your brand?
B.S.K.: Keep growing in different mediums, keep discovering myself, keep failing, too, to discover what I'm going to like and what makes me succeed, and not in a monetary form, but just in different mediums overall. During COVID-19 I started painting, I went back to Merida for about five months and I spent a whole month not working. I was getting depressed and a friend recommended I do something creative. I started painting and literally it has been the best therapy at reach. Not being afraid, you don't need to be the perfect painter, as I told you before we put so much on our shoulders. Even when you see the new generation on Instagram, and they are like ""I'm a photographer."" Fuck yeah, you are a photographer. My generation, you need a degree, approval, and then you see all these kids at 17 already as photographers, artists in their bio. Yes, believe it. You are - who is going to say no?
WWD: Do you have any words of wisdom that you can share for the next generation of Hispanic/Latinx designers who are trying to break into the industry?
B.S.K.: Be true to yourself, and trust the process. You have to find yourself, too, your identity. And trial and error, that's the best medicine and best medium to discover. I remember when COVID-19 started, I put out on Instagram that if anyone wanted to send me their thesis, I would review them, because I can imagine that being in this environment of a pandemic and being a graduate, you must think about what is going to happen to the world.

17,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1251/Files (250).DOCX","Postmedia Breaking News",2020-10-27,"1094 words","ONLINE",NA,NA,"Social media CEOs to face grilling from Republican senators",FALSE,"WASHINGTON - Less than a week before Election Day, the CEOs of Twitter, Facebook and Google are set to be grilled by Republican senators making unfounded allegations that the tech giants show anti-conservative bias. Democrats want to expand the discussion to include issues such as the companies' impact on local news.
The Senate Commerce Committee has summoned Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Sundar Pichai to testify for a hearing Wednesday. The executives have agreed to appear remotely after being threatened with subpoenas.
With the election looming, Republicans led by President Donald Trump have thrown a barrage of grievances at Big Tech's social media platforms, which they accuse without evidence of deliberately suppressing conservative, religious and anti-abortion views.
The chorus of protest rose this month after Facebook and Twitter acted to limit dissemination of an unverified political story from the conservative-leaning New York Post about Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, an unprecedented action against a major media outlet. The story, which was not confirmed by other publications, cited unverified emails from Biden's son Hunter that were reportedly disclosed by Trump allies.
Trump, asked by reporters about the companies Tuesday as he left Washington for the campaign trail, said they are trying to suppress revelations of Joe Biden's ""corruption.""
""They don't want to show corruption, like you have with Biden. That's totally corruption, and everybody knows it,"" Trump said. ""It's very unfair. Nobody has ever seen anything like this. It's not freedom of the press, it's the opposite.""
Social media giants are also under heavy scrutiny for their efforts to police misinformation about the election. Twitter and Facebook have slapped a misinformation label on content from the president, who has around 80 million followers. Trump has raised the baseless prospect of mass fraud in the vote-by-mail process.
Starting Tuesday, Facebook is not accepting any new political advertising. Previously booked political ads will be able to run until the polls close next Tuesday, when all political advertising will temporarily be banned. Google, which owns YouTube, also is halting political ads after the polls close. Twitter banned all political ads last year.
Beyond questioning the CEOs, senators will examine proposals to revise long-held legal protections for online speech, an immunity that critics in both parties say enables the companies to abdicate their responsibility to impartially moderate content.
The tech platforms are gateways to news online. Critics say their dominant position in the advertising market has crushed the struggling U.S. news industry, especially local news publishers.
A report issued Tuesday by the committee's Democratic staff cited the additional devastating impact of the recession triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. About 7,000 newspaper employees are expected to be laid off this year, and newspaper revenues will be down 70% from two decades ago, according to the report.
""Local news is an incredible engine for the creation of accurate information. We don't want to lose that infrastructure,"" Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington state, the panel's top Democrat, said in an interview.
The Democrats' report accuses the big platforms of unfairly using news content, taking news consumers' data and diverting customers from local news websites, with little compensation. It proposes that Congress enact rules preventing tech platforms from taking local news content without fair payment.
""These unfair and abusive practices should be called out,"" Cantwell said.
Democrats have focused their criticism of social media mainly on hate speech, misinformation and other content that can incite violence or keep people from voting. They have criticized Big Tech CEOs for failing to police content, homing in on the platforms' role in hate crimes and the rise of white nationalism in the U.S.
Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have scrambled to stem the tide of material that incites violence and spreads lies and baseless conspiracy theories.
The companies reject accusations of bias but have wrestled with how strongly they should intervene. They have often gone out of their way not to appear biased against conservative views - a posture that some say effectively tilts them toward those viewpoints. The effort has been especially strained for Facebook, which was caught off-guard in 2016, when it was used as a conduit by Russian agents to spread misinformation benefiting Trump's presidential campaign.
The Trump administration's Justice Department has asked Congress to strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the tech companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.
Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd told congressional leaders in a letter Tuesday that recent events have made the changes more urgent. He cited the action by Twitter and Facebook regarding the New York Post story, calling the companies' limitations ""quite concerning.""
Trump signed an executive orde r this year challenging the protections from lawsuits under a 1996 telecommunications law. A provision known as Section 230 has served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet.
""For too long, social media platforms have hidden behind Section 230 protections to censor content that deviates from their beliefs,"" Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., the committee chairman, said recently.
The head of the Federal Communications Commission, an independent agency, recently announced plans to reexamine the legal protections, potentially putting meat on the bones of Trump's order by opening the way to new rules. The move by FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, a Trump appointee, marked an about-face from the agency's previous position.
The unwelcome attention to the three companies piles onto the anxieties in the tech industry, which also faces scrutiny from the Justice Department, federal regulators, Congress and state attorneys general around the country.
Last week, the Justice Department sued Google for abusing its dominance in online search and advertising - the government's most significant attempt to protect competition since its groundbreaking case against Microsoft more than 20 years ago.
With antitrust in the spotlight, Facebook, Apple and Amazon also are under investigation at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission.

21,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1251/Files (250).DOCX","PM News",2020-06-03,"791 words",NA,NA,NA,"The suffocation of the American dream",FALSE," 'I can't breathe,' African-American George Floyd struggled to repeat as Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, knelt on his neck last week in the U.S. city of Minneapolis.
Eight minutes and 46 seconds later, Floyd died.
A day later, protests against racism and police brutality erupted, spreading rapidly across the United States in six days.
Floyd's desperate dying plea echoed the last words of Eric Garner, another African American man who died in police custody in 2014 in New York.
Garner's death also ignited high-profile protests nationwide. U.S. TV network NBC news exclaimed on Monday that 'from Eric Garner to George Floyd: protests reveal how little has changed in 6 years.'
Racism has been a chronic problem in the United States, with a history almost as old as the country itself. Floyd's death serves as a new, chilling reminder that racial discrimination seems to be showing no signs of improvement among the American population.
In a report entitled Race in America 2019, released in April by the Pew Center, 58 percent of Americans surveyed in 2019 say race relations in the United States are bad, and of those, few see them improving. Some 56 percent think the current administration has made race relations worse.
The ravaging coronavirus pandemic, meanwhile, has served to highlight the long tradition of racial inequality in the United States, after recent data compiled by the non-partisan APM Research Lab revealed that African Americans are suffering a disproportionate share of the negative health and economic impacts of COVID-19.
With a death toll of more than 20,000, African Americans are dying at a rate of 50.3 per 100,000 people, compared with 20.7 for whites, the data showed.
What's more, Washington's promise of equality and justice for all in the country has remained hollow at best. For many black and other minority groups, the American dream of equal opportunity and upward social mobility irrespective of race is slipping away.
Take the job markets for example. Even before the pandemic hit the United States, the unemployment rate among African Americans was almost twice the national rate.
As of now, the coronavirus outbreak has been distributing economic pain even more unevenly. With the national unemployment rate rising to 14.7 percent in April, black and Hispanic unemployment rates have jumped to 16.7 percent and 18.9 percent respectively, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported early May.
However, those problems themselves are not the most terrible part of a deeply-divided America - Washington's continued failure to come up with any serious answers is. And the current White House administration has made matters worse.
Amid the ongoing anti-racism protests in the country, decision-makers in Washington, instead of trying to soothe the pain and anger of the public, have been fanning the flames, calling protesters 'THUGS,' and threatening them with 'the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons.'
Playing the race card has been the trademark of this administration. It remains fresh in the mind that this administration rolled out an executive order that banned foreign nationals from seven predominantly Muslim countries from visiting the country and suspended the entry of all Syrian refugees indefinitely only one week after assuming power.
And in the middle of the rampaging COVID-19 pandemic, this administration has been busy deporting Latin American migrants back to southern-neighboring countries, showing little care that such mass deportation could make the pandemic situation in the region worse.
And because of Washington's reckless disinformation campaign to scapegoat China for its own fiasco in handling the outbreak, prejudice and hate crimes targeting Chinese and other groups of Asian origin have also shot up.
An Ipsos poll in April found that over 30 percent of Americans have witnessed COVID-19 bias against Asians. The STOP AAPI HATE reporting center, tasked to track coronavirus discrimination-related cases, has received 1,710 incident reports from Asian Americans across the country since mid-March.
It seems the incumbent U.S. administration has been leading the country in an increasingly polarized American political environment by dividing the American public, and appealing to the worst of humanity. That divide-to-win tactic will only form and reinforce a vicious cycle where division triggers more hostility, and further hostility begets greater racial alienation.
Many in the United States love to describe their country as a nation of immigrants. It once truly was. But now, with one I-can't-breathe case after another, the day when the American dream that used to celebrate ethnic diversity and equal opportunity will finally be choked to death seems not far away."

The campaign, in a statement, said that it was designed with unity in mind, taking several design aspects from former presidential campaigns. 
 The navigation on the site is fairly similar to the website of Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA). The automatic video clips were inspired by the website of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). A ticker on the site that shows small-dollar donations came from a similar element of former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg s (D) campaign site. From the website of Sen.

LATINO VOTERS. Biden unveiled an agenda for the Latino community Tuesday, blasting what it called an assault on Latino dignity by President Trump. 
His plan centers on five main goals: to invest in Latino economic mobility, to make far-reaching investments in ending health disparities by race, to expand access to high-quality education and tackle racial inequity in education, to combat hate crimes and gun violence and to secure our values as a nation of immigrants, the campaign said.

Ms Congo was born when I was living in Berea between 2004 and 2006. A big part of it was pushing back against the TinTin in the Congo book that was being reissued in about 2005. So I also had an opportunity to go to Kinshasa to perform that character, which, in South Africa, was unveiled at my first solo show at the Stevenson.
Injibhabha
In vernacular, ""injibaba"" means alopecia, which is hairline recession. It was a character made up into a couple of Afros, which was born in Switzerland as a response to quite a xenophobic, controversial poster by the Swiss People's Party - which is quite rightwing, actually. It depicted a couple of white sheep kicking the black sheep off the Swiss confederacy flag. There was actually a poster and it set off a lot of hate crimes in Europe. 
It was my first time in Europe and I was on a three-month residency. I did this Afro character as a way of pushing back. So I became this black sheep character that they were scared of. It highlights a European xenophobia under the guise of protecting utopia. That's one of the hypocrisies of nationalism. You have to use armies and passports and concentration camps to keep people out. 
Beiruth
Beiruth happens when I come back from Switzerland having experienced this awakening of European xenophobia in 2007, in the 21st fucking century. I come back and we experience these two things of the miniskirt attack and the xenophobic attacks. I used Beiruth as a way of coping. I think all of these are set off by mini traumas, or moments of devastating realisations. When all of these things happen, I think the only way that I can deal is to put on a costume and achieve that objective distance that won't make me lose my mind, literally. That is a theme that runs through everything in the relatively earlier years.
The Future White Women of Azania
There was Ilulwane, which I did with synchronised swimmers in New York and Cape Town. After this came The Future White Woman of Azania, which then becomes The Future White Women of Azania. It became a parody of growing nationalism and a growing nation. Within Azania I start to perform various characters. I perform The Versatile Queen. I perform the Elder of Azania, who is representative of the beholder of stories and propagandists, basically.

Now, I am embodying two characters in the recent body of work. Nomalizo Khwezi, who is our main protagonist in the tapestries, also embodying Malibuye Khwezi. It revolves around the idea of true names. 
In my culture, whether it is Bhaca or Xhosa, you are marking a moment in history, or predicting the future. Or trying to make sense of things. So the name becomes quite strong. Something to live up to in myth or something to betray.
Athi is a shortening of ""Athenkosi"", which means ""we are always grateful"". We give thanks. 
Khwezi is also the morning star, which is one of my favourite sights in the morning. I wake up and I go for a jog and I look at it and I feel so connected to the land, whether be it Cape Town in the urban form or Hogsback, where me and my partner live.

The speciality tea store is ­located on a busy commercial avenue in Washington's affluent Dupont Circle area, just steps away from some of the most ­popular bars and cafes, high-end hotels and multimillion-dollar town houses in the nation's ­capital, a city which prides itself on ­tolerance and diversity.
Yet, on a quiet morning last month, this was where a rising wave of xenophobia and anti-Asian sentiment came for 29-year-old Yunhan Zhang, who opened his store in February.
The store's closed circuit television captured what happened: a man, wearing red pants and a black jacket, enters the store yelling ""Covid-19!"" After being told to go away, the agitated assailant pulls out a can of pepper spray, using it on Zhang as he continues to hurl insults - which explicitly contained the term ""Chinese"" - before fleeing the scene.
For Zhang, an 11-year resident of the United States, the motive was clear. It marked the second time, he said, that he had been ­targeted in an area otherwise known for its safety.
""This type of hate crime happened to us, again,"" he wrote on Twitter the day of the incident. ""It seems we're the only business that keeps getting harassed and attacked in this neighbourhood.""
Zhang is not alone. Across the country, organisations that track discrimination, harassment and violence against Asian-Americans have noted a steady rise in incidents throughout the four years of the Trump administration.
Incidents were already on the rise as a result of US President Donald Trump's contentious relationship with China and harsh immigration policies - but overt displays of discrimination spiked during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Stop AAPI Hate Reporting Centre, a California-based group that monitors attacks on Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders, for example, reported more than 2,700 incidents between March and late October alone - a figure the organisation believes is just the ""tip of the iceberg"".
To combat this wave of xenophobia and anti-Asian sentiment, policy experts and community ­activists believe that Joe Biden's incoming administration can take a number of steps, starting with a rapid reversal of Trump's immigration policies.
John Yang, the president and executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice, a Washington-based civil rights group, said that ending many of these policies would help ""change the narrative"" on Asian-Americans.
""Immediately, we'd expect the [incoming] president to take a number of measures by executive order, or rescind executive orders that have hurt immigrants,"" he said. ""This has a direct impact on the population, but also sends a message that immigrants are welcome in the United States.""
One step that Biden could take through executive order, Yang said, was dropping the ""public charge"" rule that allowed immigration officials to deny ""green cards"" - permanent residency - to immigrants who might need public assistance, like food stamps. Opponents of the measure, first announced in 2018, have termed it a ""wealth test"" for immigrants.
""For the last four years, the narrative has been that immigrants are not welcome here, and that communities of colour are somehow a threat,"" Yang added. ""That has to change, and that can change through executive ­orders.""
Other steps could include facilitating H1-B visas, which allow US employers to temporarily employ foreign nationals in specialised occupations. In October, the Trump administration said it would impose salary requirements - of US$150,000 to US$250,000 a year, depending on location and job title - on companies employing these skilled overseas workers. At the time, the government said that the primary purpose of the change was to ""reflect the actual wages earned by US workers similarly employed to foreign workers"".
Government statistics show that most of the almost 600,000 H1-B visa holders in the US are from China and India. Earlier in the year, Trump signed an executive order suspending an array of worker visas - including H1-Bs - before that decision was overturned by a federal judge. The announcement regarding the salary requirements came the following week. Last week, a federal judge in California struck down the revised Trump administration rules.
Doing away with H1-B visa restrictions ""would send a strong signal that immigrants are welcome and that vilifying various groups isn't appropriate"", said Russell Jeung, the Stop AAPI Hate chair and an Asian American Studies professor at San Francisco State University.
""We recommend reversing immigration bans and stopping the suspension of visas for ­Chinese researchers and students, as well as rescinding the ban on racial sensitivity training"" at federal agencies, he added. ""In the first 100 days, a lot can be done to signal that we're ending racist policies.""
Many of these steps were outlined by the Biden campaign in an agenda for Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders released ahead of the November election. Biden vowed to provide a ""road map"" to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, including 1.7 million from Asia. He also promised to support family-based immigration and increase the number of visas offered for permanent, work-based immigration.
The Biden transition team did not respond to a request for comment on its plans for the Asian-American community.
Policy experts believe that a change in tone from the president and other administration officials on relations with China would have an important impact on how Asian-Americans are perceived in the US.
Jeung said that Stop AAPI Hate believes a ""more sane, diplomatic foreign policy"" - rather than a ""heated cold war"" - will help ease feelings of animosity towards Chinese and Asian-Americans in communities across the country.
""We've seen how US-China relations have impacted domestic race relations,"" he said. ""You can be critical, but ... a critique of China's policies doesn't mean we should vilify Chinese people.""
This rhetoric, Jeung added, became more pronounced during the pandemic, which Trump repeatedly termed the ""Chinese Virus"" and ""Kung Flu"". Hundreds of incidents of harassment have been recorded in which similar terms were used.
""The tone in which Trump mocked Chinese people and joked about the pandemic really gave people license to also attack the people, rather than criticise a government's policies,"" Jeung said. ""We're portrayed as outsiders and we need to have a greater sense that everyone can belong to the United States. It has a tangible impact.""
Many Chinese-American community organisers believe that having Asian-American figures in Biden's cabinet or in other high-level administration positions would serve as an important symbol. ""It would be great to see Chinese and Asian-American appointees,"" said Leanna Louie, a founder of the United Peace Collaborative, a registered non-profit organisation in San Francisco that has patrolled the city's Chinatown during the pandemic.
""If other Asians see that someone, like [businessman and former presidential candidate] Andrew Yang was in the cabinet, they'd think to get involved and help the community,"" she added.
""People need to think of the community as a whole rather than just themselves.""
Trump does have one Asian-American in his cabinet: Taiwan-born Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao, a long-time Republican figure who previously served as Secretary of Labor in the Bush administration. Last week, Trump also nominated Chao, the wife of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, to the board of trustees of the John F. Kennedy Centre for the Performing Arts.
""Having an immigrant background doesn't mean you represent the interest of immigrants, or support those of different class or racial backgrounds,"" Jeung said of Chao. ""She hasn't had much ­impact ... she either doesn't have a voice on those issues in the ­administration or hasn't been a strong enough advocate.""
Looking ahead to the Biden administration, Jeung said that he believes that the presence of vice-president-elect Kamala Harris - whose mother was from India - will have a beneficial impact on Americans whose families originated in other parts of Asia.
""She's the daughter of immigrants and talks about her ­mother. That makes a difference to the community. It's not about having diversity for diversity's sake, it's about having a diverse cabinet that understands all the different issues that we have to grapple with in the country,"" he said. ""Having a cabinet that reflects the complexity of America will only make the government stronger.""
Last Thursday, the Biden ­transition team announced that Katherine Tai, now the chief trade lawyer for the House Ways and Means Committee, would be nominated to the cabinet-level position of US trade representative. If confirmed by the Senate, Tai, a Taiwanese-American, will be the first Asian-American to hold the position. ""I cannot stress the importance of naming Katie Tai as US trade representative,"" Jeung said.
""US-China relations have deteriorated to China-bashing, and subsequently physical bashings of Chinese and Asians in the US.
""Other Americans need to see an Asian-American public official representing the US, and building bridges, not walls.""
Even if Biden were to immediately reverse Trump's immigration policies and soften his tone on China when he takes office on January 20, experts warn that a higher level of anti-Chinese and anti-Asian sentiment is likely to remain for years to come.
""Unfortunately, some of the damage has been done. Especially as we do not see a near-term resolution of Covid-19, there will be people that continue to blame Asian-Americans for the pandemic,"" Jeung said.
""Some of that hate isn't going to resolve itself immediately. That will cause tensions with respect to anti-Asian racism in the community,"" he added. ""But better rhetoric from the top is going to help immensely.""
Karlin Chan, a community ­activist and lifelong resident of New York's Chinatown who ­organises ""block watch"" patrols to safeguard local residents, said that the anti-Asian sentiment of the Trump era is merely another in a long series of difficult periods for the community in the United States.
""Once a monster rears its ugly head, it takes years to subside. It's like the ripples when you throw a big stone into a calm lake,"" he said. ""It will be years before we overcome this xenophobia.""
As Joe Biden prepares to take the reins in Washington, the stakes have never been higher for the US relationship with China and the rest of Asia.

26,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1251/Files (250).DOCX","Canadian Press",2020-10-27,"1094 words","INTERNATIONAL","Marcy Gordon, The Associated Press",NA,"Social media CEOs to face grilling from Republican senators",FALSE,"WASHINGTON - Less than a week before Election Day, the CEOs of Twitter, Facebook and Google are set to be grilled by Republican senators making unfounded allegations that the tech giants show anti-conservative bias. Democrats want to expand the discussion to include issues such as the companies' impact on local news.
The Senate Commerce Committee has summoned Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Sundar Pichai to testify for a hearing Wednesday. The executives have agreed to appear remotely after being threatened with subpoenas.
With the election looming, Republicans led by President Donald Trump have thrown a barrage of grievances at Big Tech's social media platforms, which they accuse without evidence of deliberately suppressing conservative, religious and anti-abortion views.
The chorus of protest rose this month after Facebook and Twitter acted to limit dissemination of an unverified political story from the conservative-leaning New York Post about Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, an unprecedented action against a major media outlet. The story, which was not confirmed by other publications, cited unverified emails from Biden's son Hunter that were reportedly disclosed by Trump allies.
Trump, asked by reporters about the companies Tuesday as he left Washington for the campaign trail, said they are trying to suppress revelations of Joe Biden's ""corruption.""
""They don't want to show corruption, like you have with Biden. That's totally corruption, and everybody knows it,"" Trump said. ""It's very unfair. Nobody has ever seen anything like this. It's not freedom of the press, it's the opposite.""
Social media giants are also under heavy scrutiny for their efforts to police misinformation about the election. Twitter and Facebook have slapped a misinformation label on content from the president, who has around 80 million followers. Trump has raised the baseless prospect of mass fraud in the vote-by-mail process.
Starting Tuesday, Facebook is not accepting any new political advertising. Previously booked political ads will be able to run until the polls close next Tuesday, when all political advertising will temporarily be banned. Google, which owns YouTube, also is halting political ads after the polls close. Twitter banned all political ads last year.
Beyond questioning the CEOs, senators will examine proposals to revise long-held legal protections for online speech, an immunity that critics in both parties say enables the companies to abdicate their responsibility to impartially moderate content.
The tech platforms are gateways to news online. Critics say their dominant position in the advertising market has crushed the struggling U.S. news industry, especially local news publishers.
A report issued Tuesday by the committee's Democratic staff cited the additional devastating impact of the recession triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. About 7,000 newspaper employees are expected to be laid off this year, and newspaper revenues will be down 70% from two decades ago, according to the report.
""Local news is an incredible engine for the creation of accurate information. We don't want to lose that infrastructure,"" Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington state, the panel's top Democrat, said in an interview.
The Democrats' report accuses the big platforms of unfairly using news content, taking news consumers' data and diverting customers from local news websites, with little compensation. It proposes that Congress enact rules preventing tech platforms from taking local news content without fair payment.
""These unfair and abusive practices should be called out,"" Cantwell said.
Democrats have focused their criticism of social media mainly on hate speech, misinformation and other content that can incite violence or keep people from voting. They have criticized Big Tech CEOs for failing to police content, homing in on the platforms' role in hate crimes and the rise of white nationalism in the U.S.
Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have scrambled to stem the tide of material that incites violence and spreads lies and baseless conspiracy theories.
The companies reject accusations of bias but have wrestled with how strongly they should intervene. They have often gone out of their way not to appear biased against conservative views - a posture that some say effectively tilts them toward those viewpoints. The effort has been especially strained for Facebook, which was caught off-guard in 2016, when it was used as a conduit by Russian agents to spread misinformation benefiting Trump's presidential campaign.
The Trump administration's Justice Department has asked Congress to strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the tech companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.
Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd told congressional leaders in a letter Tuesday that recent events have made the changes more urgent. He cited the action by Twitter and Facebook regarding the New York Post story, calling the companies' limitations ""quite concerning.""
Trump signed an executive orde r this year challenging the protections from lawsuits under a 1996 telecommunications law. A provision known as Section 230 has served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet.
""For too long, social media platforms have hidden behind Section 230 protections to censor content that deviates from their beliefs,"" Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., the committee chairman, said recently.
The head of the Federal Communications Commission, an independent agency, recently announced plans to reexamine the legal protections, potentially putting meat on the bones of Trump's order by opening the way to new rules. The move by FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, a Trump appointee, marked an about-face from the agency's previous position.
The unwelcome attention to the three companies piles onto the anxieties in the tech industry, which also faces scrutiny from the Justice Department, federal regulators, Congress and state attorneys general around the country.
Last week, the Justice Department sued Google for abusing its dominance in online search and advertising - the government's most significant attempt to protect competition since its groundbreaking case against Microsoft more than 20 years ago.
With antitrust in the spotlight, Facebook, Apple and Amazon also are under investigation at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission.

In Columbia, S.C., on Saturday, a young protester told a reporter that she just didn't think voting is ''how change happens.'' 
 ''They've been telling us to do that for so long,'' she added, ''and we've done it -- and look at everything that's still going on.''
 Fury over the cruel death of George Floyd, a black man in police custody, combined with fear of a deadly virus and its painful economic impact, make this a dark, dizzying moment in our national life. But African-Americans shouldn't feel hopeless, because the black vote does matter -- it has never mattered more. It is at the heart of the fight to take back America.
 The biggest story of 2020 politics is hard to ignore. But somehow it is being ignored.
 The black vote now defines American politics.
 Joe Biden would be retired if not for the black vote. Black voters made him the Democrats' presidential nominee. In November, the number of black voters who turn out in the crucial swing states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin is likely to be the deciding factor in the election. That means black voters, 12 percent of the national electorate, are set to pick our next president.
 Black women, the most reliable activist base of the party, are this year's version of the stars of past campaigns -- Soccer Moms and Blue Collar Moms. The best illustration of this power is a black woman asking Jim Clyburn, her South Carolina congressman, who he planned to vote for in the primary. He said Joe Biden and followed up with a public endorsement: ''We know Joe. But most importantly, Joe knows us.''
 Mr. Biden went on to blow out the competition in South Carolina and easily win the rest of the South. Two top competitors with no traction among black voters, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, dropped out and endorsed him.
 The party's sudden consolidation around Mr. Biden abruptly ended a confusing race that many feared was hurtling toward an open convention. Few had seen it coming. Mr. Biden looked boring in comparison with the impassioned Bernie Sanders and the furious Donald Trump. Yet polls consistently showed that in a general election matchup, it was Mr. Biden who held the highest margin of victory over Mr. Trump.
 There are many reasons for black voters to like Mr. Biden -- his record on judicial appointments and voting rights during his long tenure on the Senate Judiciary Committee; his work on federal stimulus spending after the recession and on Obamacare; and of course his service as vice president to the nation's first black president.
 But beating Mr. Trump tops the list. For black voters, the prospect of four more years of this administration is about more than politics.
 It's personal.
 It is a reaction born of real fear -- of the racism that led a white man to shoot Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia and a white police officer to press his knee into the neck of George Floyd in Minnesota, of the racism that every day results in more black people dying of the coronavirus. African-Americans see this, and they see a president who does nothing to stop it.
 Contrary to the image created by news coverage of the Black Lives Matter protests, 43 percent of black voters are moderates. A quarter identify as conservatives. These are the black people in church on Sunday. They are proud members of a sorority or fraternity.
 Russian trolls recognized the power of these voters. ''No single group'' was targeted more than African-Americans, according to a Senate Intelligence Committee report on interference in the 2016 presidential election.
 The Russians wanted to drive down black enthusiasm for Hillary Clinton. But they also worked to deepen the black-white divide to increase white turnout for the Republican Party.
 Their bots and trolls depicted black Americans as synonymous with the loudest activists in the Black Lives Matter movement. They amplified Mr. Trump's tactic of appealing to ''forgotten'' white voters by demonizing blacks and Latinos, suggesting they bring crime and bad schools into white neighborhoods and contribute to the flight of American jobs.
 The strategy seems to have succeeded.
 In 2016, while white turnout went up, ''the black voter turnout rate declined for the first time in 20 years in a presidential election,'' according to the Pew Research Center.
 President Trump, too, recognizes the power of the black vote. After his upset win in 2016, he said: Blacks ''didn't come out to vote for Hillary. They didn't come out. And that was big -- so thank you to the African-American community.''
 Today he continues putting his attention and campaign money into diminishing the impact of black voters.
 First, he wants to attract more than the 8 percent of the black vote he won in 2016. He likes to cite low unemployment statistics as evidence that he is a good president for black Americans. Of course, black unemployment fell to 7.5 percent from 16.8 percent under President Obama; it fell two more points under Mr. Trump before skyrocketing in the course of the pandemic.
 But if he can't get them to vote for him, he'd like to keep them from voting at all.
 Mr. Trump is opposed to mail-in voting, even during the pandemic, saying it is fertile ground for fraud. But his real concern seems to be that making voting easier in any way means more members of minorities will vote, and vote for Democrats. In March he was explicit in saying ''you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again'' if mail-in voting were allowed. Last week he doubled down, tweeting that it would ''lead to the end of our great Republican Party.''
 (In fact, there is no evidence of widespread mail-in voting fraud, many states already allow it, and some studies suggest that it actually helps Republicans.)
 Third, Mr. Trump is trying to assure suburban white female voters that they shouldn't fear being labeled racist if they vote for him.
 White women moved away from the Republican Party in the 2018 midterms in part in reaction to Mr. Trump's bully-boy behavior and the racial division he encourages. They didn't want to be seen as some of those ''fine people,'' as Mr. Trump described the white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va.
 During the Super Bowl, white women and blacks were the target audience of a high-priced ad centered on the president's decision to commute the prison sentence of a black woman who had been in jail for 21 years for a nonviolent drug conviction. Then, during his 2020 State of the Union address, he celebrated a former member of the Tuskegee Airmen and featured a black woman and her daughter who received an academic scholarship.
 But anyone who remembers Mr. Trump's record of disrespect toward women, and black women in particular, isn't going to fall for this act.
 He told four congresswomen of color, three of whom were born in the United States, that they should ''go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.'' He called Representative Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, a ''low-IQ person'' and Omarosa Manigault Newman, a former aide, a ''dog.'' He said one black reporter was a ''loser'' and another asked ''a lot of stupid questions.''
 ''His supporters are right -- he does attack everyone,'' Adia Harvey Wingfield, a sociology professor at Washington University in St. Louis, told The Washington Post. ''But there's also a clear commonality in the attacks he levels against people of color and black professionals. These are straight out of historic playbooks about black workers and professionals in particular -- not being qualified, not being intelligent or having what it takes to succeed in a predominantly white environment.''
 After three years of Mr. Trump as president, 65 percent of black people say it is a ''bad time'' to be black in America, according to a January Washington Post-Ipsos poll. Just as dispiriting, most black people now say white Americans ''do not understand'' the discrimination they face. That applies to white Democrats as well as white Republicans.
 The sense of racial isolation is fueled by the high incidence of hate crimes against black people -- as well as against Latinos and Jews.
 And then there is the anxiety over the prospect of four more years of being invisible as the president sets national goals. For example, Mr. Trump regularly demeans government workers, many of whom are black. He's still trying to dismantle the Affordable Care Act and cut financial aid to the unemployed.
 Mr. Trump was slow to respond to the coronavirus overall. But he really failed to step up to the crisis in black America.
 ''The disproportionate impact of Covid-19 crisis is only having the effect of increasing people's disdain and distrust of Trump and the entire administration,'' Adrianne Shropshire, the executive director of BlackPAC, a super PAC focused on black Democrats, told The New York Times.
 After Mr. Arbery was stopped while jogging on a residential Georgia street and shot to death for no apparent reason, Mr. Trump said it was ''very disturbing'' but added that the gunmen might have reacted to ''something that we didn't see on the tape.'' The refusal to condemn the attack outright led black activists to complain that even in the face of what looked like murder, Mr. Trump felt the need to nod to his ''largely white coalition,'' according to The Washington Post.
 ''When you have hate emanating from the Oval Office, why are we surprised?'' said Karen Bass, a California congresswoman who heads the Congressional Black Caucus, about the shooting.
 Black Americans have had enough. They have an explosive, personal investment in defeating Mr. Trump in 2020. More than 80 percent of them say Mr. Trump is a racist. For them, defeating him is the civil rights movement of 2020.
 And it is not an empty threat.
 If black voters returned to the polls at their 2012 levels, the Democratic presidential candidate ''would win the Electoral College by 294-244,'' according to an analysis by the Center for American Progress.
 If Mr. Biden chooses a black woman as his running mate, as many expect him to do, it could further boost turnout. He is said to be considering Kamala Harris, Val Demings and Stacey Abrams. He has also promised to name a black woman to the Supreme Court. Given their role in his triumph in the Democratic primaries, black women are at a point of maximal leverage in demanding a seat at the table of power.
 One 2006 study of voting patterns found that black Democratic candidates spurred a jump of two to three percentage points in turnout among blacks and whites. There is the risk of increasing the number of whites voting in opposition to the black candidate. But that risk comes with a big benefit if the history-making ticket sparks a boost in black turnout in swing states.
 White Democrats actually were ''a little more likely than black Democrats to think a black nominee would help the ticket's chances,'' according to the summary of a CBS News poll in early May. Most black voters say their priority for a vice president is simply that the candidate -- black or white -- increases Mr. Biden's chance of winning. In late May, polls showed the top choice for Mr. Biden's vice president among black and white Democrats was Senator Elizabeth Warren.
 It's likely that Mr. Trump is now hoping that suburban white voters will be so frightened by the protests against police violence and news footage of broken windows at Target stores that they will turn to him in sufficient numbers to nullify the black vote. Stoking racial divisions may work for his base, but not for voters in the middle. Polls show most independents have already decided they can't support Mr. Trump. Now they have seen the tape of Mr. Floyd dying. Violent protests may make them anxious, but they have had their eyes opened to injustice.
 These are dark days, but black voters' profile and power have never been this high. They have the chance to lead the nation to recovery. Civil rights leaders, who pushed for the 1965 Voting Rights Act and had their blood spilled to register black voters, dreamed of this moment.

First, he wants to attract more than the 8 percent of the black vote he won in 2016. He likes to cite low unemployment statistics as evidence that he is a good president for black Americans. Of course, black unemployment fell to 7.5 percent from 16.8 percent under President Obama; it fell two more points under Mr. Trump before skyrocketing in the course of the pandemic.
But if he can’t get them to vote for him, he’d like to keep them from voting at all.
Mr. Trump is opposed to mail-in voting, even during the pandemic, saying it is fertile ground for fraud. But his real concern seems to be that making voting easier in any way means more members of minorities will vote, and vote for Democrats. In March he was explicit in saying “you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again” if mail-in voting were allowed. Last week he doubled down, tweeting that it would “lead to the end of our great Republican Party.”
(In fact, there is no evidence of widespread mail-in voting fraud. Many states already allow mail-in voting, and some studies suggest that it actually helps Republicans.)
Third, Mr. Trump is trying to assure suburban white female voters that they shouldn’t fear being labeled racist if they vote for him.
White women moved away from the Republican Party in the 2018 midterms in part in reaction to Mr. Trump’s bully-boy behavior and the racial division he encourages. They didn’t want to be seen as some of those “fine people,” as Mr. Trump described the white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va.
During the Super Bowl, white women and blacks were the target audience of a high-priced ad centered on the president’s decision to commute the prison sentence of a black woman who had been in jail for 21 years for a nonviolent drug conviction. Then, during his 2020 State of the Union address, he celebrated a former member of the Tuskegee Airmen and featured a black woman and her daughter who received an academic scholarship.
But anyone who remembers Mr. Trump’s record of disrespect toward women, and black women in particular, isn’t going to fall for this act.
He told four congresswomen of color, three of whom were born in the United States, that they should “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.” He called Representative Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, a “low-IQ person” and Omarosa Manigault Newman, a former aide, a “dog.” He said one black reporter was a “loser” and another asked “a lot of stupid questions.”
“His supporters are right — he does attack everyone,” Adia Harvey Wingfield, a sociology professor at Washington University in St. Louis, told The Washington Post. “But there’s also a clear commonality in the attacks he levels against people of color and black professionals. These are straight out of historic playbooks about black workers and professionals in particular — not being qualified, not being intelligent or having what it takes to succeed in a predominantly white environment.”
After three years of Mr. Trump as president, 65 percent of black people say it is a “bad time” to be black in America, according to a January Washington Post-Ipsos poll. Just as dispiriting, most black people now say white Americans “do not understand” the discrimination they face. That applies to white Democrats as well as white Republicans.
The sense of racial isolation is fueled by the high incidence of hate crimes against black people — as well as against Latinos and Jews.
And then there is the anxiety over the prospect of four more years of being invisible as the president sets national goals. For example, Mr. Trump regularly demeans government workers, many of whom are black. He’s still trying to dismantle the Affordable Care Act and cut financial aid to the unemployed.
Mr. Trump was slow to respond to the coronavirus overall. But he really failed to step up to the crisis in black America.
“The disproportionate impact of Covid-19 crisis is only having the effect of increasing people’s disdain and distrust of Trump and the entire administration,” Adrianne Shropshire, the executive director of BlackPAC, a super PAC focused on black Democrats, told The New York Times.
After Mr. Arbery was stopped while jogging on a residential Georgia street and shot to death for no apparent reason, Mr. Trump said it was “very disturbing” but added that the gunmen might have reacted to “something that we didn’t see on the tape.” The refusal to condemn the attack outright led black activists to complain that even in the face of what looked like murder, Mr. Trump felt the need to nod to his “largely white coalition,” according to The Washington Post.
“When you have hate emanating from the Oval Office, why are we surprised?” said Karen Bass, a California congresswoman who heads the Congressional Black Caucus, about the shooting.
Black Americans have had enough. They have an explosive, personal investment in defeating Mr. Trump in 2020. More than 80 percent of them say Mr. Trump is a racist. For them, defeating him is the civil rights movement of 2020.
And it is not an empty threat.
If black voters returned to the polls at their 2012 levels, the Democratic presidential candidate “would win the Electoral College by 294-244,” according to an analysis by the Center for American Progress.
If Mr. Biden chooses a black woman as his running mate, as many expect him to do, it could further boost turnout. He is said to be considering Kamala Harris, Val Demings and Stacey Abrams. He has also promised to name a black woman to the Supreme Court. Given their role in his triumph in the Democratic primaries, black women are at a point of maximal leverage in demanding a seat at the table of power.
One 2006 study of voting patterns found that black Democratic candidates spurred a jump of two to three percentage points in turnout among blacks and whites. There is the risk of increasing the number of whites voting in opposition to the black candidate. But that risk comes with a big benefit if the history-making ticket sparks a boost in black turnout in swing states.
White Democrats actually were “a little more likely than black Democrats to think a black nominee would help the ticket’s chances,” according to the summary of a CBS News poll in early May. Most black voters say their priority for a vice president is simply that the candidate — black or white — increases Mr. Biden’s chance of winning. In late May, polls showed the top choice for Mr. Biden’s vice president among black and white Democrats was Senator Elizabeth Warren.
It’s likely that Mr. Trump is now hoping that suburban white voters will be so frightened by the protests against police violence and news footage of broken windows at Target stores that they will turn to him in sufficient numbers to nullify the black vote. Stoking racial divisions may work for his base, but not for voters in the middle. Polls show most independents have already decided they can’t support Mr. Trump. Now they have seen the tape of Mr. Floyd dying. Violent protests may make them anxious, but they have had their eyes opened to injustice.
These are dark days, but black voters’ profile and power have never been this high. They have the chance to lead the nation to recovery. Civil rights leaders, who pushed for the 1965 Voting Rights Act and had their blood spilled to register black voters, dreamed of this moment.

Video of Amy Cooper with her dog in Central Park was widely shared on social media on Monday. Twitter/@melodyMcooper
Amy Cooper, the white woman who was recorded calling the police on a Black bird watcher after he asked her to leash her dog in Central Park, has been charged with a misdemeanor for making a false police report, the Manhattan District Attorney's office announced.
""Today, our office initiated a prosecution of Amy Cooper for falsely reporting an incident in the third degree,"" Manhattan DA Cy Vance said in a Monday statement.
The incident, caught on camera hours before Minneapolis police were called on George Floyd for allegedly passing a counterfeit bill, sparked a national debate on racial bias in policing that exploded into widespread protests and social tumult following Floyd's death in custody.
The birdwatcher - Christian Cooper, a black man of no relation - recorded the encounter on his phone. After his sister posted footage of the incident on Twitter, it was viewed more than 25 million times in 24 hours. Another chapter in an ongoing narrative of police being called on black Americans for ""living while black"" quickly became a cultural flashpoint.
Christian Cooper had been birdwatching early Monday morning in the Ramble, a bosky, secluded area in Central Park which draws hundreds of species of birds, when he encountered Amy Cooper and her dog. The white cocker spaniel mix was not on a leash, a violation of park rules posted on several conspicuous signs in the area - and one which the dog owner herself has acknowledged.
Christian Cooper told CNN that he pulled out dog treats, which he keeps on him for exactly such an occasion. They excite dogs, forcing defiant owners to restrain them.
""I'm taking a picture and calling the cops,"" Amy Cooper says on the video, suggesting possible consequences. ""I'm going to tell them there's an African-American man threatening my life.""
""Please tell them whatever you like,"" he replies.
She then raised her phone to place the call.
""There's a man - African-American - he has a bicycle helmet,"" she says. ""He is recording me and threatening me and my dog.""
""I'm being threatened by a man in the Ramble,"" she continues. ""Please send the cops immediately.""
Eventually, she leashes her dog.
""Thank you,"" Christian Cooper says as he stops the recording.
By the time officers from the New York Police Department arrived, both of the individuals had left.
Amy Cooper later apologized in a statement.
""I am well aware of the pain that misassumptions and insensitive statements about race cause and would never have imagined that I would be involved in the type of incident that occurred with Chris,"" she wrote. ""I hope that a few mortifying seconds in a lifetime of 40 years will not define me in his eyes and that he will accept my sincere apology.""
In an interview with CBS This Morning's Gayle King, Christian Cooper called it ""unmistakably racist.""
""I don't know whether she's a racist or not,"" he said. ""I don't know her life. I don't know how she lives it. That act was unmistakably racist, even if she didn't realize it in the moment.""
Earlier that month, Georgia law enforcement arrested white former police officer Gregory McMichael and his son in the murder of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old black man who was killed while jogging through a tree-lined Brunswick neighborhood. McMichael had told police that he believed Arbery was a burglary suspect. The Department of Justice is reportedly investigating the killing of Ahmaud Arbery as a possible federal hate crime.
Amy Cooper's arraignment is scheduled Oct. 14, per Vance's statement.
""At this time I would like to encourage anyone who has been the target of false reporting to contact our office,"" Vance said. ""We are strongly committed to holding perpetrators of this conduct accountable."""

In hindsight, June 16 2015 was a turning point, a date critical to understanding today's political tumult. That was the day Donald Trump announced his candidacy for president, theatrically descending the escalator at Trump Tower, then giving a rambling speech that linked illegal immigration, terrorism, and the offshoring of American jobs. 
It was the moment when he introduced the phrase ""Make America Great Again"" and vowed to build a ""great, great wall on our southern border."" The media would focus on his derogatory remarks about Mexicans ""bringing drugs, bringing crime."" Trump's candidacy would cause an immediate spike in hate crimes and send political groups scrambling to join forces with-or distance themselves from-whichever group he targeted next. His following surged as he rode the wave of white nationalist backlash to immigration, failed wars and a black incumbent.
Among the more intriguing developments in the wake of Trump's candidacy was the rise in anti-Muslim speech from Hispanic celebrities and public figures. Conservative Hispanic politicians had long argued that immigration reform was stalling because of Muslim terrorists slipping through the southern border. For example, New Mexico Governor Susan Martinez had called for more security at the US-Mexico border in 2013, after Border Patrol agents found candy wrappers with Arabic writing. 
But Trump's brutal joining of the question of Hispanic migration with terrorism, of Islamophobia, and Hispanophobia (long linked in French and English colonial thought, but not in the American imaginary) would unleash a torrent of anti-Muslim speech on Spanish talk radio and social media. Miss Puerto Rico Destiny Vélez tweeted that Muslims ""terrorise innocent Americans,"" adding that, ""Mexicans, Arabs, Jews and anything in between aren't the same thing."" 
In August 2015, Ramon Escobar, a youngish Hispanic American diplomat who had handled State Department engagement with the Muslim world, ranted to a handful of journalists about his tour in Saudi Arabia, saying that in the Gulf's failed societies ""it's always the will of Allah"" and expressed outrage that Latinos were being associated with terrorism. 
As the campaign unfolded, more prominent Hispanic politicians sounded off: Texas Senator Ted Cruz called for law enforcement to patrol Muslim neighborhoods while Florida Senator Marco Rubio denigrated President Barack Obama for visiting a mosque in Baltimore. This rhetoric was aimed at distancing Latinos from Muslims, to signal that Latinos were not a national security issue.
Trump's candidacy and rise to office ultimately proved as politically cataclysmic as the events of September 11, 2001, generating unexpected animosities, alliances, and bizarre new discourses. Thirty percent of Latinos ended up voting for Trump, while Hindu nationalists rallied behind his stances on terrorism and immigration. But Trump's ascent also precipitated much solidarity on the left, as groups mobilised against the Muslim ban and to defend DACA. 
Resistance to Trump also coalesced to produce wins for progressive candidates nationwide, including four women of color (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib) elected to Congress in 2018 who became known as The Squad. These victories occurred alongside a surge of hate crimes against Jews, Muslims, and Hispanics, with a terrible mass shooting of Hispanics at a Walmart in Texas in November 2019. As groups integrate into the American political process, they often reflect the country's deep rifts, frequently manifesting in a split between those wanting to express solidarity or opposition to the Muslim other. 
Unsurprisingly, the Trump years have been characterised by a rise in Hispanic Islamophobia, including the tragic high-profile murders of Muslims by young Hispanics, most prominently of Nadra Hassanen in Washington, DC and Imam Maulana Akonjee and Thara Uddin at a mosque in Ozone Park, Queens.
In early 2005, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the David C. Driskell Center for the Study of the African Diaspora at the University of Maryland, trying to understand a social movement that was spreading rapidly across US campuses and cities, and eventually to France and Britain. The Save Darfur movement took off in early 2004-in circumstances not unlike the present moment-as a buffoonish, flailing Republican president ran for a second term against a lackluster Democratic candidate in a war on terror context. 
I subsequently published an essay in Middle East Report titled ""Slavery, Genocide and the Politics of Outrage: Understanding the New Racial Olympics"" that sought to explain why of all the civil wars in Africa and humanitarian crises in the world, it was the mass violence in western Sudan that had gripped the American imagination. The answer, I argued, lay in the post-September 11 domestic political scene:
The Save Darfur movement started on college campuses to counter pro-Palestinian agitation. When Students for Justice in Palestine would bring Israeli refuseniks to speak, the American Anti-Slavery Group founded by Charles Jacobs-who would also launch Save Darfur-would respond by bringing Sudanese ""lost boys"" to speak about Arab racism. Jacobs was also the founder of The David Project, which monitored Middle East Studies departments for alleged anti-Israel prejudice and funded the film Columbia UnBecoming, which claims to document incidents of bias in that university's Department of Middle East and Asian Languages and Cultures.
To show how these three American nationalisms - evangelical, Jewish and black - overlapped in Sudan, I highlighted three frontiers: the colonial and Huntingtonian so-called faultline between Africa and the Arab world that ran through Sudan; the urban periphery where competing conceptions of the Middle East co-existed uneasily and where Latino immigration was leading to fears of ethnic succession; and finally the US-Mexico border where Hispanic migration had led to Minuteman vigilantism and to Samuel Huntington's warning of a ""demographic Reconquista"" and a backlash from whites fearing ""replacement.""
The current protest movement against police brutality-unfolding during a horrific pandemic crisis that has exposed and deepened societal fissures-clearly differs from the Save Darfur movement. For starters, the current protest is against American state violence, specifically the recurring spectacle of police cruelty against black men. Black Lives Matter is not calling for military intervention, and in fact has an anti-colonial facet. Save Darfur activists, on the other hand, would often chant ""Out of Iraq, Into Sudan.""
Since the Covid-19 crisis began in February, the global war on terror seems to have faded away; the war on the new ""invisible enemy""-and the Trump administration's hapless response-have dominated headlines. The absence of a Muslim bogeyman seems to have created space for new alliances and coalitions, as the establishment foreign policy hawks have receded from view. Another difference is that while, in 2005, some older Afrocentrists (like the late comedian Dick Gregory) supported Save Darfur, the majority of black (and minority) leaders steered clear of the movement. 
Save Darfur ended up being a largely white movement led by a Jewish-Christian coalition. Jewish organisations, which agitated on campuses in the mid-2000s, have been relatively silent in recent years, perhaps because their policy objectives have been achieved. The Department of Education has moved to sanction and deny Title VI funding to a number of Middle East Studies programs deemed biased, the US embassy has been relocated to Jerusalem and Israel is moving to annex additional Palestinian territories.
The current movement, under the aegis of Black Lives Matter, is multi-ethnic and multi-racial, and while it has inspired protests globally, it is focused domestically on police violence and reparations. If Trumpism was a response to the humiliation of failed wars in Afghanistan and Iraq (it is no coincidence that the Minuteman Project began patrolling the southern border days after the Abu Ghraib story broke) then Black Lives Matter is protesting the militarisation of urban policing resulting from those same unending wars. 
The decades of counterinsurgency abroad have boomeranged back home with the expansion of mass surveillance under Obama and the continuation of the Pentagon's 1033 program that has transferred $7.4-billion of surplus military equipment (such as armored vehicles and rifles) to law enforcement departments nationwide.
In February 2015, The Guardian broke a story about a ""black site"" operated by domestic law enforcement in Chicago, echoing the secret detention facilities used by US defense and intelligence agencies to interrogate and torture prisoners overseas. The militarisation of policing may have been newsworthy in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014 after the death of Michael Brown at the hands of the police, but it barely registered in 2012 when then-Mayor Pete Buttigieg shared a New York Times article titled ""With Green Beret Tactics, Combating Gang Warfare"" with the comment: ""Interesting use of counter-insurgency tactics to address gang violence."" Nor was much made of Minnesota Governor Tom Waltz's recent claim that the unrest made American cities look like Baghdad or Mogadishu.
Now, 15 years after Save Darfur, American power and prestige are vastly diminished. In 2005, the neo-cons calling for intervention in Sudan were in part vexed by China's access to Sudan's oil, as well as Beijing's refusal to isolate the regime of former Sudanese President Omar Al-Bashir. (Stephen Spielberg famously withdrew as adviser to the Beijing Olympics because of China's Darfur policy.) Today as Chinese-American relations are in free-fall, China has surpassed the United States as Africa's biggest trade partner and Trump allegedly appealed to Chinese President Xi Jinping for help in the upcoming election.
But the parallels and continuities between Save Darfur and the current movement are striking-the three frontiers are still politically relevant. At his inaugural speech, Trump warned that ""places like Afghanistan are safer than our inner cities."" The president is still intrigued by comparisons of Islam's ""bloody borders"" with the southern US border and continues to link the two, as when he threatened to designate Mexican drug cartels terrorist organisations, or when he placed Venezuela on the updated Muslim ban list because the Maduro government was allegedly granting Venezuelan passports to Hezbollah militants.
Prima facie, the president's fascination with the inner city may appear less comprehensible than his obsession with the southern border; but these two frontiers are critical to understanding his persona. Trump's America First worldview, we are told, is rooted in Jacksonian nationalism, which harks back to Andrew Jackson, the notorious slave-owning and slave-selling president and architect of the Indian Removal Act, whose portrait currently hangs in the Oval Office. 
In his well-regarded Special Providence: American Foreign Policy and How It Changed the World (2002), Walter Russell Mead describes the Jacksonian tradition as the honor-based, Scotch-Irish ethno-nationalism of the American frontier, a folk community hostile to elites, immigration, and international law, which believes the US should deploy ruthless military power whenever threatened. In an aside, Mead argues that despite their white supremacist roots, Jacksonian values had a major influence on African American culture in the South and also in the gang culture of inner cities which have re-created ""the atmosphere and practices of American frontier life.""
Few would think of Trump as a blend of hip hop and Jacksonian swag, but a case could be made. Trump was an icon in hip hop culture for decades, a symbol of ostentatious wealth, his name mentioned in some 300 rap lyrics. As Charles Blow of The New York Times wrote, the Queens-born real estate magnate rose alongside the genre in 1970s New York watching ""the moguls it made, the bravado it brandished. He liked it, envied it, aped it."" And for all his disdain for poor minorities, soon learned ""how to assert white privilege and emulate black power."" 
In fact, Trump weaponised New York city's hip hop culture, appropriating - in Blow's words - the ""coarser side"" of black culture to build a blustering populist brand that propelled him to the country's highest political office. It is ironic that as gangsta rap declined in the mid-2000s (making way for a gentler, more up-lifting Kendrick-Drake sound), its echoes can still be seen in the Oval Office and among populist strongmen elsewhere. Consider Brazilian leader Jair Bolsonaro, who has a coterie of MAGA-hat-wearing rappers who compose lyrics in support of his reactionary platform. Still, it is worth emphasising that in the US (and Brazil) the hip hop community turned overwhelmingly against Trump once he was in the White House.
As during the Darfur crisis, the Muslim grocer in the inner city is still a source of contention. In November 2005, liquor stores in Oakland owned by Muslim immigrants were vandalised (one store burnt down, and an employee kidnapped.) In 2015, following the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson outside a store owned by an Indian immigrant, a boycott was organised of immigrant-owned stores. Anger at the figure of the Muslim grocer has surfaced again since the death of George Floyd, when it emerged that the call to the police was made by an employee of a Palestinian-owned grocery, prompting more calls for boycotts as well as attacks against Middle Eastern and South Asian-owned businesses in a range of cities. The debate continues among African Americans on the merits of solidarity with Arab/Muslim organisations. 
In 2005, Arab and Muslim activists were focused on lobbying the US Census Bureau to add a new MENA (Middle Eastern and North Africa) minority status category that would allow Americans from the region to claim non-white identity, and thus qualify for various civil rights protections (including special status as potential hate crime victims) as well as benefit from affirmative action policies. An energised black-Palestinian left emerged in 2014 speaking of a Gaza-Ferguson nexus, but a self-described school of Afropessimism continues to be wary of forming solidarities, especially with the Arab world where these critics say ""anti-blackness"" is ""foundational.""
Given that the Trump White House has flatly opposed the census request, these young anti-racism activists from Arab and Muslim backgrounds have turned their energy to countering police violence and surveillance as well as addressing the image of the anti-black Muslim shop-owner. 
Multiple initiatives have been launched by Middle Eastern and North African Americans - scholars and activists - most recently ""Arabs For Black Lives"" that attempt to mediate between Muslim grocers and their patrons by providing training in cultural difference, de-escalation, and support for these merchants to ""go green"" and carry produce in lieu of liquor and junk food. The generation that was in high school during the Darfur crisis has now come of age. 
But there remains a political gulf between this younger generation of woke Muslim activists, who are eager for acceptance into BLM and similar coalitions, and who are harshly critical of the much-maligned grocer - sometimes speaking of them as settlers and exploitative colonists-and the older generation (among them the shop-owners) who do not understand the difference between a Becky and a Karen, and do not see why they should be criticised for selling the alcohol and tobacco products their customers demand. 
Ironically, some of this local opposition leads Muslim grocers to relocate to Hispanic neighborhoods, where immigrant merchants selling such products have been less likely to draw criticism. Despite the Islamophobic rhetoric from political hopefuls, a recent poll shows that among whites, blacks and Hispanics, Hispanic Americans score the lowest on the Islamophobia Index, with Hispanic Americans five times more likely to hold favorable opinions of Muslims than negative ones (51% versus 10%).
In my 2005 essay, I concluded by observing that the topic of racism in North Africa and the Middle East has long been dominated by external interests and actors and marked by official suppression of all discussions of the region's legacies of slavery and racism. But even in the mid-2000s, one could see the emergence of an anti-racism discourse in the Middle East, enabled by the internet. That process has accelerated. The final sentence called for a celebration and mobilisation of Afro-Arab identity against tired Arab nationalist narratives and colonial separations.
Since the 2011 uprisings in the Middle East, and especially with the passage of Tunisia's anti-racism law in October 2018, social media abounds with Afro-Arab activists and new collectives. These black Arab voices run the gamut from socialist pan-Africanist feminists who quote Angela Davis to Afrocentrists who quote John Henry Clarke and his theory of Arabs overrunning Africa, a discourse last heard during the Save Darfur moment. The past is preface.
Geopolitically, much has changed-and not changed. The Sudanese strongman Omar Al-Bashir was toppled by a protest movement and is in prison awaiting an International Criminal Court trial for war crimes committed in Darfur. Yet Sudan is still in America's crosshairs. The mass violence in South Sudan has not resonated with the American public, but the new Sudanese regime is still under heavy pressure from Washington to recognise Israel in exchange for a lifting of sanctions-coercion that could derail Sudan's transition. Brand activism continues as well. 
Save Darfur drew celebrities and corporate actors, as companies began selling Darfur underwear, video games, and Timberland boots. Today retail companies are scrambling to capitalise on Black Lives Matter. Walmart has pledged to stop locking up so-called multicultural hair products in display cases and BAND-AID has released new bandages in different skin tones.
In conclusion, it is worth recalling that before America's grand ""awokening"" of 2020, there were protest movements in Sudan, Lebanon, Chile, Algeria, France, and Spain centered on exclusion and state violence. It is exhilarating to watch a protest movement against state brutality, white supremacy, colonial memory, and Trump-inspired racist contagion spread around the world. But it is not clear that an American-style anti-racism can counter racism in societies elsewhere, with their own race regimes and constructs. More importantly, it is worth noting that a backlash to the current protests is in the offing. 
This counter-movement could easily attempt to unify a polarised nation with time-honored tactics of division and distraction: by smashing current links of solidarity and directing the collective anger and bereavement caused by American policy failures toward a domestic or international other, be that Iran, Venezuela, Sudan, or mosques in America, as happened in 2005.

Zionist",FALSE,"Sep 21, 2020( Elder of Ziyon: http://elderofziyon.blogspot.com Delivered by Newstex) From Ian: Eugene Kontorovich: International Law for Just One Nation[1] Like a drunk looking for his keys under the lamppost, the authors invariably attach great weight to every scrap of evidence in favor of their arguments, while discounting or entirely ignoring contrary evidence. Both authors, for example, give almost conclusive weight to the International Court of Justice's Advisory 2004 opinion in the Wall case, where the Court opined that territory can be deemed 'occupied' even if it had no prior sovereign. But the ICJ opinion was, as the authors are aware, 'advisory,' and thus not legally binding. As a formal matter, the ICJ's opinion deserves no more legal weight than the quality of its legal arguments. 
On this point, it made none, but rather cited the numerous U.N. resolutions that had said the same thing, all solely in the context of Israel. In any case, the ICJ opinion was only issued in 2004, further discounting its value, for both legal and sociological reasons. Under basic principles of international law, the law that would govern Israel's presence in the West Bank is the law as it was understood in 1967, not subsequent interpretations. Moreover, by 2004, and indeed, much earlier, the question of occupation of non-sovereign territory had become entirely synonymous with the question of Israel and the territories; it could hardly be treated as an abstract legal question. On the other hand, both authors entirely ignore the Cession of Vessels and Tugs for Navigation on the Danube case, which was decided before 1967, and would thus state the law as it was when Israel took control of the territories. That case held that the territory that was not under the sovereignty of any state could not become occupied. That means that the West Bank, which was not under any sovereignty when Israel ended Jordanian control, could not be deemed occupied. Dinstein's failure to acknowledge this precedent, which goes contrary to his conclusions, is a particularly odd lapse given that he cites Danube Tugs as authority for other propositions of occupation law. Yet even these authors, who largely track the conventional U.N. consensus on these matters, try to take seriously the fact that they are dealing with legal texts. Many readers will be surprised that both authors agree that the broad and undifferentiated treatment of Israeli settlers as 'illegal' lacks any basis. In the commonplace understanding, any Jewish presence across the Green Line is ipso facto illegal. This is the view that animates groups such as Peace Now and Btselem, who condemn every individual Jewish-inhabited housing unit. But the authors note there is simply no colorable basis in Art. 49 for such a comprehensive ban: it does not prohibit the nationals of an occupying power from moving to or living in the territory. Rather, it regulates certain actions by occupying powers to move its population there. In particular, it requires acts of 'transfer' by the occupying power, a term which the authors interpret sweepingly, but still excluding clearly private actions. Thus, both authors agree that Israelis who purchase land in private transactions, or move to land they had prior title to, cannot conceivably fall within these prohibitions. Dinstein also points out that 'so called 'outposts''#8212;settlements established in the face of opposition by the Israeli government-would have to be considered legal under international law, precisely because they are illegal under Israeli law. Yet neither book takes these points to their logical conclusion. They agree that 'transfer' must refer to movements of people caused by official government action, but in practice they interpret causation in a 'but for' way, rather than a more direct causation of the kind typically required by criminal prohibitions. That is, to say that 'transfer' occurs when Israel makes it possible for its citizens to move to the West Bank, or does not discourage residence there relative to other places, is to interpret a ban on transfer as a requirement of discouragement, which appears nowhere in the convention. Nonetheless, it is important to note the gap between the somewhat more limited version of the rule conceded by these authors and the absolute ban assumed by the international community and pro-Palestinian NGOs. It is an odd coincidence that the legal interpretation of the obscure Art. 49(6) adopted by so many happens to be entirely congruent with Palestinian political demands and negotiating positions.Thomas Friedman's Folly[2]Friedman, like his newspaper, routinely applied a double standard to Israel (that he imaginatively recast as a 'unique double dimension'). He preposterously claimed that when Israel no longer was 'judged by standards applied to no other country,' it meant that 'something very essential in Israel's character and the character of the Jewish people has died.' He declined to say what double standards revealed about journalistic integrity. Returning to the United States as a Times columnist who could lacerate Israel at will, Friedman believed that there was 'no hope for peace without a Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank.' Yearning for a 'total Israeli withdrawal' to pre-1967 lines, he warned that without a two-state solution, 'Israel will be stuck with an apartheid-like, democracy-sapping, permanent occupation.' Echoing a trope favored by his colleague Anthony Lewis, he feared that 'scary religious nationalist zealots' might lead Israel into the 'dark corner' of a South African future of apartheid. But Friedman's dark fantasies about Israel unless it obeys his peace proposals reveal nothing more than his frustration that the Jewish state does not heed his advice for a return to its pre-1967 borders. That, of course, would heighten its vulnerability to new waves of Palestinian terrorism. He remains as he was as a Brandeis undergraduate: yearning for Palestinian statehood and furious at Israel for its determination to rebuild a state within its ancient Jewish homeland. To be sure, Friedman is hardly alone at the New York Times. In an editorial (Sept. 17) celebrating the normalization of relations between Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain, the Times reiterated its hackneyed insistence that 'a true Middle East peace deal' requires 'an accommodation' (a two-state solution) with Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. But even a cursory glance at the refusal of Palestinians under Yasser Arafat to accept a peace that would have given them the entire West Bank and Gaza for their own state would suggest otherwise. Thomas Friedman and the New York Times are a perfect match for the blame-Israel-first prize.https://www.drybonesproject.com/blog/D19715_1.pngDavid Collier: Canadian research house EKOS spews a twisted anti-Israel survey[3]Ekos Research Associates is a social and economic research company in Canada run by Frank Graves. They have just put their name to some rather vicious anti-Israel propaganda. Lies, manipulation and EKOS Long before anyone in the UK knew who I was, I put a comment under a Tony Greenstein blog pointing out a truly glaring factual error. Greenstein's response was to delete my comment. This type of action speaks volumes and this event was part of my awakening into understanding the real danger these people pose. Who deliberately lies but those that set out to deceive? Their need to spread lies is the key reason behind their refusal to engage or debate. It is why they block people like me on social media. We have nothing to fear from the truth - they most certainly do. Which brings us to their methods. One of the more intelligent ways that they spread disinformation is through twisting surveys. They have long understood that if you ask the right question, you will get whatever answer it is you are looking for. A skill they have just put to good use in Canada. According to a recently published survey carried out by EKOS almost every Canadian thinks Israel should be investigated for war crimes: https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.188.149/3e8.04f.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/monodweiss1-1024x352.jpg84%? Almost nothing is ever as high as 84% and certainly not Canadian animosity towards Israel. We know this is not true - so here is how they did it. A story of how Ekos Research Associates put their name to anti-Israel propaganda. The bad, the nasty and the even worse Ekos Research Associates were commissioned to conduct an online survey on Canadian attitudes towards Israel by three groups - Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East (CJPME), Independent Jewish Voices Canada (IJV), and the United Network for Justice and Peace in Palestine-Israel (UNJPPI). UJPPI have a FB page with 184 'followers'. Their Twitter account has 132 'followers'. Their posts and tweets generally remain unsupported. Of their last 15 tweets, two received a single like, the other 13 got none. Their Facebook page is equally dormant. Their blog has numerous outrageous posts, even coming out in support of Linda Sarsour.Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Zionist[4]To Linda Sarsour, who once angrily proclaimed that you cannot be a feminist if you are a Zionist, meet our fearless Jewish feminist champion, Ruth Bader Ginsburg z""l. Proud and unapologetic Zionist. 'I am sometimes asked 'Who were your role models?'' Ginsburg said. 'The term role model was not yet in vogue in my childhood,' she added, with a Hermione Granger-ish glint. 'But thinking back, I recall two Jewish women both raised in the USA whose humanity and bravery inspired me in my growing up years.' 'Emma Lazarus was a Zionist before that word came into vogue,' Ginsburg said, praising the 20th century Sephardic writer. 'Her poem 'The New Colossus,' etched on the base of the Statue of Liberty, has welcomed legions of immigrants including my father and grandparents — people seeking in the U.S.A. shelter from fear, and longing to find freedom from intolerance.' Letting this swipe at anti-immigration politics — or, depending how you look at it, accurate representation of US history — hang in the air, the Justice went on. 'My next inspirer: Hadassah-founder Henrietta Szold.' Szlold, who was apparently gifted with the same bottomless energy as Ginsburg, was a university lecturer, a prolific writer and editor, and an organizer who helped save thousands of Jewish children during the Holocaust. She also started night schools to educate Jewish immigrants who arrived in America in the late 19th century, the same kind, the Justice added, that educated Ginsburg's father when he first arrived in America. Additionally, as Ginsburg proudly added, 'She was a Zionist even before Theodore Herzl came on the scene.' Will @MSNBC[5] discipline its anchor @AymanM[6] for this lie? There is no civil marriage in Israel, never has been. Secular couples of the same faith have the same problem. (Answer: don't hold your breath about consequences) https://t.co /QlZ6Z3aUMC[7] — Gary Weiss (@gary_weiss) September 20, 2020[8] Jonathan Tobin: End fake anti-Semitism charges[9]The line between normal political warfare and actual dog-whistling to haters is one that seems to depend on party preferences. Democrats say that when Republicans like President Donald Trump called Bloomberg an ""elite"" and a ""globalist,"" that's dog-whistling to anti-Semites because those terms have been used by hate groups against Jews. But Republicans can argue that resentment against an out-of-touch press magnate and politician is permissible even if they are Jewish. Trump was also denounced this week for referring to Israel as ""your country"" during his annual Rosh Hashanah conference call with Jewish leaders. Democrats say that he was invoking the dual-loyalty canard against Jews that encourages far-right anti-Semites to smear Jews. A president who was more careful about his speech would never have said something like that. American Jews are Americans, not Israelis, and Trump's use of the phrase was, as it has been in the past, inappropriate and wrong. But the notion that he was expressing anti-Semitism while promoting support for the Jewish state is more than a stretch. Israel is the nation-state of the Jewish people to which most Jews feel deep ties and for whose security many work tirelessly to help ensure. To the extent that extremists speak of Jews manipulating American policy for Israel's sake - the ""Zionist occupation government"" or ZOG, they are also usually referring to Trump and his pro-Israel policies. The same people who are screaming ""anti-Semitism"" about that were silent when former Vice President Joe Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, met with an open anti-Semite who happened to be the father of a victim of a police shooting in Kenosha, Wis. Harris saying she was ""proud"" of Jacob Blake's family, despite the fact that Jacob Blake Sr. promotes anti-Semitic smears and is an open supporter of Nation of Islam hatemonger Louis Farrakhan that could be said to legitimize his extremism. Had Trump met with such an extremist from the right - no matter what the circumstances - he would be pronounced guilty by association. Democrats also saw nothing amiss about Pelosi's endorsement of Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), despite their backing for the anti-Semitic BDS movement and for spouting memes of-Jew hatred directly rather than engaging in dog-whistling. The speaker's party and its mainstream media cheerleaders gave both the coddling of the congresswomen and the meeting with Blake a pass. All of these actions can be labeled questionable or worse. But it's also true that using them to validate claims that Biden, Harris or Pelosi are Jew-haters are unjustified. And as much as many Democrats take it as an article of faith that Trump is an anti-Semite is equally untrue. There are plenty of examples of real anti-Semitism, both in terms of violence and open advocacy for hate, without seeking to weaponize words or actions that, while debatable, were clearly not intended to be hateful for partisan purposes. In a country in which politics has replaced religion for many people and in which loyalty to their political tribe has priority over anything else, it's hardly surprising that too many Jews only see anti-Semitism when it can be associated with their political enemies and are blind to it when it comes from those they see as allies. On the eve of the Jewish New Year and as the traditional period of cheshbon hanefesh (""accounting of the soul""), it's time for American Jews to stop politicizing anti-Semitism. The only people who benefit from such tawdry partisan exploitation of a real problem are actual anti-Semites.Measure To Fight Anti-Semitism Opposed By Majority Of House Democrats[10]An amendment opposing anti-Semitism was passed Wednesday despite being rejected by a wide majority of Democrats. An amendment to the Equity and Inclusion Enforcement Act (EIEA) aims to include anti-Semitism as a form of discrimination based on race, color, or national origin. The Republican-proposed amendment passed despite more than 70% of House Democrats voting against it Wednesday. Representatives of districts with large Jewish populations were among those in opposition to this measure. Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York was one of the 162 House Democrats to vote against the measure. Nadler's district is home to the largest Jewish community in the United States. The EIEA aims to strengthen Title VI of the Civil Rights Act by restoring 'the right to individual civil actions in cases involving disparate impact.' This piece of legislation was introduced by Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia and Democratic Rep. John Conyers, Jr. of Michigan. Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina proposed the amendment in an effort to include Jewish people in the protections offered to other minorities in the EIEA. (RELATED: Dems Attempt To Show Unity After Delay Of Anti-Semitism Resolution) 'With anti-Semitism on the rise around the world, the need for this amendment is clear,' Foxx said, according to The Washington Free Beacon. The bill was proposed following a year of increased anti-Semitic attacks. Anti-Semitic incidents rose by 12% in one year, the Anti-Defamation League found, according to the New York Times. When congressmen and women do not recognize antisemitism to be far more than ""religious discrimination"", you know we have a systematic issue of antisemitism in this country, that is deeply rooted in ignorance wrt what it means to be Jewish. https://t.co/30HZHsx65M[11] — Claire Voltaire (@Claire_Voltaire) September 20, 2020[12] PMW: Unrepentant terrorist heading to San. Fran. State U. SFSU has invited unrepentant terrorist Laila Khaled to take part in a university event this Wednesday, that is in breach of US anti-terror laws[13]San Francisco State University (SFSU) has invited unrepentant terrorist Laila Khaled to take part in a university event this Wednesday, Sept. 23, that is in breach of US anti-terror laws. Khaled is a member of and has held senior positions in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). The PFLP is designated as a terrorist organization in the United States, the European Union, Canada and Israel. The PFLP is responsible for scores of terror attacks that resulted in the deaths of dozens of Israelis. Terror attacks of particular note include the assassination of Israel's Minister of Tourism, Rehavam Ze'evi, the sending of suicide bombers, and the recent murder of Israeli teenager Rina Schnerb on August 23, 2019. Khaled has been an active terrorist of the PFLP for over five decades. In 1969, Khaled and other terrorists hijacked TWA flight 840 from Rome to Tel Aviv. The plane was diverted to Beirut where all the non-Israeli passengers were released. While some Israeli passengers were released soon after, other spent months in captivity. Khaled was so motivated to continue hijacking civilian aircraft that after her picture appeared in the press, she underwent six plastic surgery operations to change her appearance. In 1970 together with an accomplice she attempted to hijack an EL-AL flight from Amsterdam to New York, in which a flight attendant was murdered. This hijacking was one of four simultaneous hijackings carried out by the PFLP. The hijacking was foiled by security personnel who shot Khaled's accomplice, Patrick Argüello, and overpowered Khaled. Khaled was handed over and held by British police until she was exchanged on Oct. 1, 1970 for hostages held by the PFLP. Khaled has never given up on terror as a means to achieve the goal of 'liberating Palestine' - i.e ., murdering Israelis and destroying Israel. The following are terrorist Khaled's opinions on terror, hijackings, negotiations, and destroying Israel - in her own words: HonestReporting Videos: Notorious Terrorist to Shape Hearts and Minds on Campus Leila Khaled is a Palestinian terrorist known for her membership in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. She conducted numerous attacks on behalf of the group. This week, San Francisco State University is inviting her to participate in a conference via Zoom.

[15]In the late 1920s, Iranian Jewish academic and scholar Solaiman Haiim single-handedly created Iran's first modern Farsi to English dictionary and English to Farsi dictionary. Haiim's comprehensive two-volume dictionary was an invaluable resource, helping hundreds of thousands of Iranian students of all faiths to learn English and overcome the language barrier. For nearly five decades Haiim's name appropriately appeared on the dictionary he created until the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran when the Khomeini regime removed the name of this Jewish man from this significant dictionary. To this day Haiim's name does not appear on his dictionaries that are published in Iran. Likewise, the Iranian Ayatollahs have also removed or omitted the names of other prominent Jewish academics from hundreds of textbooks, journals and academic papers published in the country. For the last 40 years, most of Iran's Jews have resettled in Southern California with the hopes of creating new lives and not only having a voice in their new homeland but having their history remembered. Sadly, last month the State of California's Department of Education with its latest release of its Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum has totally ignored Iranian Jewry and their history in Iran. Moreover, it's shameful that the state with the largest Iranian Jewish population in the country who claims to have created an all-inclusive educational material for the state's schools, has failed to even mention the Jews of Iran and the anti-Semitism they faced at the hands of Iran's Ayatollahs in their new proposed ethnic studies curriculum. For the past 20 years I have had the special privilege of reporting on and sharing the stories of my Iranian Jewish community who have been living in Southern California and New York. Their experiences in escaping or fleeing Khomeini's anti-Semitic Iran sometimes with only the shirts on their backs is heartbreaking. They still bear the scars from Iran's Islamic revolution that almost overnight turned them into third class citizens in Iran and stripped them of nearly all of their rights. As a result, after several decades, still many Iranian American Jews are often too traumatized to even speak about the nightmares they experienced in Iran.Guardian corrects Raja Shehadeh's false claim over 'confiscation of Palestinian land'[16]On Thursday, we posted about a Guardian op-ed by Raja Shehadeh ('Occupying Palestine is rotting Israel from inside. No Gulf peace deal can hide that', Sept. 17) that was riddled with egregious distortions and falsehoods, including the following: It is all out in the open and the government and the courts are on the same page in supporting the settlers and working to achieve the goal of greater Israel. The Knesset has passed the regularisation bill, which 'legalises' settlements built on privately owned Palestinian land via de facto expropriation.As we wrote in our complaint to the Guardian's Readers Editor: though the passage links to a 2016 Guardian article about the passage of the bill, in June 2020, the Israeli supreme court overturned that law, rendering it null and void. Editors promptly upheld our complaint and deleted the erroneous claim from the article. BBC World Service radio coverage of the Bahrain-Israel agreement[17]So while BBC audiences did not hear any comment on the story from representatives of either the Bahraini or Israeli governments, they did get an obviously partisan opposition view from a 'human rights defender' who does not currently reside in Bahrain. An edited version of that interview with al Khawaja were also aired in one of the September 12th editions of the BBC World Service radio programme 'Weekend'. Presenter Pascale Harter used a similar introduction (from 00:42 here) to the one given by Marshall the previous evening. Harter: 'But we start today in Bahrain in what might be described as a win for the current US administration ahead of November's presidential election, two Arab states will be at a signing ceremony next week at the White House making their peace with Israel. As widely expected, Bahrain has followed the decision of the United Arab Emirates to normalise relations with Israel. It was President Trump who Tweeted the news, describing the Bahraini move as another historic breakthrough. And indeed it does break with the history of Arab states - Jordan and Egypt aside - refusing to establish ties with Israel until there is a settlement of the Palestinian issue. The Bahraini king said that this was a new era of peace, however not everyone welcomed the deal. Maryam al Khawaja is a member of Bahrain's Shiite Muslim majority. She spoke to the BBC from Denmark.' Al Khawaja: 'I think a lot of the outrage is because the people of Bahrain were not expecting the Bahraini regime to go to the point of making this deal against the will of the Bahraini people. The former speaker was talking about how this was for the benefit of the Bahraini people. Nothing about this deal has anything to do about the well-being or the protection of the Bahraini or the Palestinian people. The Bahraini people are not a free people. Bahrain is not a free country. People don't have the right to have opinions or to express those opinions. It's very obvious that this is a decision made by the government and it has nothing to do with the Bahraini people.'Listeners to this programme did at least get to hear an alternative view from Ebrahim Nonoo, a member of Bahrain's small Jewish community which was confusingly described by Harter as 'indigenous' despite its 19th century origins. One of Harter's questions was particularly interesting: Harter: 'What if the Shiite youth doesn't support this deal and you see more demonstrations on the streets, perhaps stoked or encouraged by your neighbour Iran?'That phrasing implies that the BBC is in fact more aware of the broader background to the topic of dissenting voices in Bahrain than its coverage clarified to audiences worldwide.US journalists group take stand in support of Al Jazeera[18]Two officials from the US National Press Club have issued a statement criticizing the US Depart of Justice's order from this past Monday requiring that a US-based affiliate of the Al Jazeera network register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). According to National Press Club President Michael Freedman and president of the National Press Club Journalism Institute Angela Greiling, the Department of Justice's decision ""effectively says that the US government views Al Jazeera to be a propaganda arm of the Qatari government rather than the independent news organization that journalists all over the world know it to be."" The statement from Freedman and Greiling points out that ""FARA was developed during World War II to block Nazi propaganda from influencing Americans,"" and requires designated foreign entities to reveal their sources of funding and to file regular public disclosures about their activity. ""The classification of Al Jazeera under FARA seems wholly political. The Trump Administration has close ties to UAE and Saudi Arabia even as the United States shares long-term strategic interests with Qatar exemplified by the Air Force's reliance on the large air base at Al Udeid,"" the statement argues. Freedman and Greiling's statement also calls the timing of the DOJ order, which was issued a day before the United Arab Emirates signed a peace agreement with Israel, ""of note,"" and points out that the UAE has made it ""one of its priorities"" to ""undercut Al Jazeera's journalism since it worked with Saudi Arabia in 2017 to impose a blockade on Qatar, which provide state funding to the news organization.""NY to direct hate crimes unit to investigate antisemitic graffiti at NYU[19]Following the recent appearance of antisemitic and racist graffiti scribbled across the side of a New York University (NYU) buidling, the state government has decided to direct the Hate Crimes Task Force to assist with investigations. ""I am appalled to see media reports of hateful antisemitic and anti-Black graffiti scrawled on the side of an NYU building,"" the NY Governor's Office said. ""The fact that Rosh Hashanah begins tonight makes this bigoted graffiti all the more hurtful, as does the placement on a building dedicated to education. ""This is not who we are as New Yorkers and I am directing the New York State Police Hate Crimes Task Force to assist in the investigation immediately."" The graffiti itself was found on an NYU Silver Center for Arts and Sciences building in Greenwich Village, and the suspect appears to be a heavyset man who on the day in question was wearing a gray hat and a white bandana covering his face. ""Jews = N*****s"" and ""Kill the N****r,"" the graffiti said, according to New York Daily News.French Court Jails Neo-Nazi Apologist and Holocaust Denier for Antisemitic Messages[20]A French court jailed an unrepentant antisemitic activist on Friday for two postings on the internet that defamed Jews and a third that denied the Holocaust. Herv Lalin — who also goes by the name Herv Ryssen — has now begun a 17-month jail term at the Fleury-Mrogis prison near Paris for the three offenses, committed between 2017 and 2020. The court convicted Lalin for a series of antisemitic postings on Facebook and Twitter, as well as for a video he published on YouTube in 2018 — called 'The Jews, Incest and Hysteria' — in which he attacked Jews as a 'people of incest.' A book-length screed by Lalin — published in 2018 and titled 'Antisemitism Without Complexity or Taboo' — was condemned for denying the truth of the Nazi Holocaust, a criminal offense in France. In a recent analysis of the French far right, the newspaper Liberation identified Lalin as an integral member of a network of propagandists who were dedicated to the denial and distortion of the Holocaust.Auschwitz survivor speaks out on the atrocities of the Holocaust[21]Milanese-born Auschwitz survivor Liliana Segre, who recently celebrated her 90th birthday, is recognized as an Italian patriot, so much so that in 2018, President Sergio Matarella named her a Senator for life. Segre's mother died when she was a baby, and she was raised by her father and his parents. The family was secular, and Segre barely knew she was Jewish until after November, 1938, when the Italian racial decrees were enacted. Segre experienced the evils of antisemitism while still in elementary school. Under the racial laws, Jews were excluded from public office and higher education, and were deprived of many of their civil rights. After a brief period of persecution, Segre's father, Antonio, obtained false documents and hid her with friends. Milan is only 166 kilometers from the Swiss border, and Segre's father planned to get them to safety in the neighboring neutral country. They left Milan on December 10, 1943, but Swiss border guards denied them entry. They were arrested in Italy the following day, and after more than a month's detention in different places, were deported to Auschwitz.Israel sends emergency supplies to malaria-stricken Chad[22]When Israeli Flying Aid delivered several shipping containers full of donated medical equipment and food to refugees and orphans in Chad last October, IFA founder and CEO Gal Lusky said they would be back. Last week, despite the pandemic, a Hercules military transport aircraft took off from an Israeli military base in the south, filled to capacity with items donated by IFA and the American Jewish Committee (AJC) — 2,000 six-person tents, personal protection equipment (PPE) for medical teams, backpack sprayers to eradicate malaria-carrying mosquitos, and more. 'The operation was completed tonight after 24 nerve-wracking hours,' Lusky told ISRAEL21c on September 17. 'It was amazing. The pilot was so emotional when they finally landed at 1 a.m.' With all the turmoil in the world, people aren't paying attention to what is happening in Chad, Lusky says. The African country has absorbed many refugees from neighboring countries who have been victimized by radical Muslim jihadis including Boko Haram. One of the biggest refugee camps, with 30,000 people, is near Lake Chad. 'Nobody is speaking about the floods at Lake Chad,' Lusky tells ISRAEL21c. 'They suffer from terrible malaria there. In that one refugee camp there are 12,000 cases of malaria.'The first Haredi and Ethiopian women in Knesset[23]Israel faces a turning point in its history amid the COVID-19 pandemic and the country's diplomatic successes this year. 'We see a huge awakening of aliyah that we haven't seen since the 1990s,' says Immigration and Absorption Minister Pnina Tamano-Shata. Tamano-Shata is Israel's first government minister from the Ethiopian Jewish community, a milestone in history that she says is a recognition of the community and the Jewish people's accomplishment here. Tamano-Shata was joined in this year's unity government and Knesset by another first, Diaspora Affairs Minister Omer Yankelevitch is also the first ultra-Orthodox woman to run a ministry. Yankelevitch sees a unique opportunity today for a different kind of dialogue, not only as the first ultra-Orthodox woman in the Knesset but also an opportunity 'to connect the entire Jewish people to a unifying and inclusive discourse, to talk about what unites us and not what separates.' These two groundbreaking women from two different communities represent the diverse face of Israel and are contributing to influencing Israel's role in the world and the Jewish people's successful journey in the world. In late August, Tamano-Shata was one of the many victims of COVID-19 in Israel and she spoke to The Jerusalem Post from her home while recuperating. 'The desire to come to Israel in the Jewish world during the pandemic illustrates how the Jewish community sees how important Israel is, and my office is working closely on their right to aliyah,' she says. She estimates that 12,000 olim may arrive this year with an additional 70,000 to 90,000 estimated to come next year.Play Video[24] We have lots of ideas, but we need more resources to be even more effective.

32,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1251/Files (250).DOCX","The Technician: North Carolina State University",2020-06-25,"740 words","NEWS; Pg. 1","Mariana Fabian, Correspondent",NA,"OPINION: Southern pride doesn't have to be based on racist symbols",FALSE,"In most education systems across the U.S., students are taught about the importance of the Civil War: The North vs. the South, one side fighting for slavery to stick around and the other fighting against them. As the war raged on, the South flew the ill-famed Confederate flag, one that I'm sure many Americans recognize today - and not for a good reason.
This heinous flag is still etched throughout the states in front of government buildings. It's also plastered on T-shirts, hats, license plates-the list goes on. I see it hung on a flagpole every single time I go back to my hometown in Virginia. It is a reminder of the rampant racism that continues to plague the U.S. that needs to be put to a stop.
Many white Americans claim that the Confederate flag is a salute to their Southern pride. They say that the flag isn't racist or offensive, as it is a form of heritage. While it is a part of history, I do wonder: Why is this a history that Americans want to remember? One where the country was laid to flames because slavery--not including the current prison system-was being put to an end. The same goes for Confederate statues being taken down across the U.S. right now. Several fell in Raleigh recently; one was a Confederate artilleryman while the other was a memorial for fallen Confederate soldiers. This all made me very proud to be from Raleigh as it went viral. It should be noted that, according to Jonathan Horn, the man who wrote Robert E. Lee's biography, titled, ""The Man Who Would Not Be Washington,"" when the Confederacy fell, even their leader, Robert E. Lee, swore his allegiance to the Union after the war.
""It's often forgotten that Lee himself, after the Civil War, opposed monuments, specifically Confederate war monuments,"" said Horn in an interview with PBS. Even at his funeral, he requested prior to his death that the Confederate flag not be displayed and didn't want to be buried in his uniform.
There is no doubt that this flag represents hate and bigotry. In June 2015, a young man named Dylann Roof committed a hate crime when he entered a church in Charleston and shot and killed nine Black individuals. Before any white supremacists or nationalists try to tell me it was just a coincidence that Roof flew the Confederate flag proudly, I will remind them of the manifesto that was posted before the shooting. 
The New York Times paraphrased this manifesto as it reads: ""I am not in the position to, alone, go into the ghetto and fight. I chose Charleston because it is most historic city in my state, and at one time had the highest ratio of blacks to Whites in the country. We have no skinheads, no real KKK, no one doing anything but talking on the internet. Well someone has to have the bravery to take it to the real world, and I guess that has to be me.""
For Southerners, the bigots who carry the flag around make the rest of them look bad. In an article by The Atlantic, a Southerner named Tyler Bishop talks about his experience with the racist symbol and his childhood.
Bishop talked about growing up in the South and what it taught him. He learned to appreciate the little things in life, and have a lot of love for friends and family. Bishop also learned how important it was to understand differing ideas from his own and challenge preconceived ideas he had. ""Real people-real southerners-are defined by these values every day,"" Bishop wrote. However, these values and ideologies aren't things people think of when they think of the South. Yes, it has to do with how people praise the Confederate flag as a form of heritage, instead of acknowledging its problematic history. 
Bishop also talked about how, while symbols are important, using the Confederate flag belittles the South as a region that is entrenched in racism. That is simply not true. It is now the responsibility of true Southerners to forget about the Confederate flag and reclaim Southern pride. 
Concluding with what Bishop said: ""Because if the Confederate flag is my only means of displaying my Southern pride, then the South has already lost me."" 
It is time for the South to let go of this flag and the history that comes with it. Being Southern doesn't have to include these symbols that, frankly, make minorities feel uncomfortable and unsafe. There has to be more than just Confederate symbols that the South can use to represent its values and strengths. Southerners, let's reclaim your pride and bring honor back to the South."

Sumaiya Ahmed, who poses, hijabless but demure, in a photo accompanying the article, complains: 'You'd think growing up in a predominantly Asian area in London would mean not having to deal with racism and Islamophobia. But as a British-Bangladeshi Muslim, I can say racism in this city runs deep.' Racism?
 What race is Islam again? What race is wearing the hijab? In any case, this article proceeds from the assumption that women who wear hijabs in the UK (and the US) are routinely subjected to discrimination and harassment, and that Britons (and Americans) consequently need this reminder that decent folk treat hijabis with respect. Hijabis should indeed be treated with respect, like everyone else, but it is false that they are routinely disrespected in this country. In fact, many of the most celebrated of the cases claiming this turned out to have been faked by the victims themselves. In one such incident, an eleven-year-old girl in Toronto made international headlines with her claim that a man had followed her and cut her hijab with scissors. After an investigation, police concluded that the attack never happened[2]. Likewise, Yasmin Seweid, a Muslim teen who claimed in December 2016 that Trump supporters on a New York subway tore off her hijab and no one in the packed subway car helped her. She, too, gained international media attention, and she, too, made up the whole thing[3]. Shortly before that, a hijab-wearing Muslim student at San Diego State University also falsely claimed[4] that she was assaulted by Trump supporters. In July 2017, a Muslim in Britain falsely claimed[5] that a man had pulled off her hijab in a 'race hate attack.' In November 2016, a University of Michigan Muslim student claimed[6] she was 'accosted by a white man who told her to remove her hijab or he would set her ablaze with a cigarette lighter.' She also fabricated the whole event. And there are many others of this kind. The hijab symbolizes the subjugation of women in Islam. Women are required to wear the hijab according to Islamic law because it is their responsibility to remove temptation from men. If men are tempted anyway and they end up being sexually assaulted or raped, it's their fault. Because the hijab is an important part of a woman's responsibility under Sharia, many women have been brutalized and even killed for not wearing it. Aqsa Parvez's Muslim father choked her to death[7] with her hijab after she refused to wear it. Amina Muse Ali was a Christian woman in Somalia whom Muslims murdered because she wasn't wearing a hijab.[8] 40 women were murdered in Iraq in 2007[9] for not wearing the hijab. Alya Al-Safar's Muslim cousin threatened to kill her[10] and harm her family because she stopped wearing the hijab in Britain. Amira Osman Hamid faced whipping[11] in Sudan for refusing to wear the hijab. An Egyptian girl, also named Amira, committed suicide[12] after being brutalized by her family for refusing to wear the hijab. Muslim and non-Muslim teachers at the Islamic College of South Australia were told they had to wear the hijab[13] or be fired. Women in Chechnya were police shot with paintballs[14] because they weren't wearing hijab. Other women in Chechnya were threatened by men with automatic rifles[15] for not wearing hijab. Elementary school teachers in Tunisia were threatened with death[16] for not wearing hijab. Syrian schoolgirls were forbidden to go to school[17] unless they wore hijab. Women in Gaza were forced by Hamas[18] to wear hijab. Women in London were threatened with murder[19] by Muslim thugs if they didn't wear hijab. An anonymous young Muslim woman doffed her hijab outside her home and started living a double life[20] in fear of her parents. Fifteen girls in Saudi Arabia were killed[21] when the religious police wouldn't let them leave their burning school building because they had taken off their hijabs in their all-female environment. A girl in Italy had her head shaved[22] by her mother for not wearing hijab. Other women and girls have been killed or threatened, or live in fear for daring not to wear the hijab. Women in Iran continue to protest against the Islamic regime[23] by daring to take off their hijabs, despite the fact that they face heavy prison sentences for doing so. But where is the weepy article in the UK's Metro about the many victims of hijab? Who is standing with them? Robert Spencer is the director of Jihad Watch[24] and a Shillman Fellow at the David Horowitz Freedom Center. He is author of 21 books, including the New York Times bestsellers The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam (and the Crusades)[25] and The Truth About Muhammad[26].

34,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1251/Files (250).DOCX","The New York Times",2020-06-11,"1684 words","US","Manny Fernandez and Patricia Mazzei",NA,"Houston Bids Goodbye to George Floyd, Whose Killing Galvanized a Movement",FALSE,"The funeral served as both a national reckoning and a moment of personal mourning. The Rev. Al Sharpton demanded more action against police brutality.
HOUSTON — George Floyd died at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis. A thousand miles to the south, in the Texas city where he was raised, two rows of police officers saluted as his coffin went past.
Hours before Mr. Floyd’s funeral began at a southwest Houston church, uniformed officers stood between the hearse and the front doors. As relatives and friends pushed the gold coffin with blue trimming into the church, the officers raised their hands in a show of respect.
Mr. Floyd’s funeral and the public viewing that preceded it a day earlier have been a counterpoint to the fury that his death touched off in cities across America. Mr. Floyd, who grew up in a tough public housing complex in Houston’s predominantly black Third Ward, was considered a native son, and the tone adopted by protesters, activists, elected officials and police officers has been one of honoring a grieving Houston family.
Inside the Fountain of Praise church, Mr. Floyd, 46, the emblem of an international movement whose name has been chanted by thousands of people since his death, was remembered as the son, brother, uncle and father that he was in life.
George Perry Floyd Jr. was born in North Carolina but grew up in the Cuney Homes housing complex in Houston. He was a 1993 graduate of Jack Yates High School, where he played on the basketball team as a 6-foot-6 power forward “able to dunk with both hands.” And he was a father of five and grandfather of two, according to the funeral program.
His relatives referred to him as “Superman.”
“The world knows George Floyd,” said Kathleen McGee, one of his aunts, surrounded by relatives, all dressed in white. “I know him as Perry Jr. He was a pesky little rascal, but we all loved him.”
Like the funerals of Michael Brown and Eric Garner in 2014, Mr. Floyd’s funeral became a moment of both national reckoning and mourning, as black leaders and Mr. Floyd’s family celebrated his life and denounced the brutality of his death.
The funeral aired live on broadcast and cable television, and as it began at noon, the New York Stock Exchange went silent for eight minutes, 46 seconds — the length of time a Minneapolis police officer held Mr. Floyd’s neck under his knee before he died. It was the longest moment of silence on the stock exchange floor in its 228-year history.
In Houston, speaker after speaker invoked the political moment born out of what happened in Minneapolis.
“This was not just a tragedy. It was a crime,” said the Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights leader who delivered the eulogy.
“We must commit to this family — all of these families, all of his children, grandchildren and all — that until these people pay for what they did, that we’re going to be there with them,” Mr. Sharpton said. “Because lives like George’s will not matter until somebody pays the cost for taking their lives.”
He admonished the country’s political and business leaders for belatedly saying they were sorry for the mistreatment of African-Americans. “Don’t apologize — give Colin Kaepernick a job back,” he said, referring to the former N.F.L. quarterback. “We don’t want an apology. We want him repaired.”
The service came after five days of public memorials in Minneapolis, North Carolina and Houston, and two weeks after the Minneapolis police officer was caught on video making the arrest that ended Mr. Floyd’s life.
On Monday, a public viewing in Houston drew nearly 6,400 people, including Gov. Greg Abbott, nurses fresh from work dressed in scrubs, new fathers holding babies and Mr. Floyd’s high school classmates. Following Tuesday’s service, he was to be buried at the Houston Memorial Gardens in a grave next to his mother, Larcenia Floyd, who died in 2018.
In a video message, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, offered his condolences to the family, saying he understood the weight of grieving in public. Mr. Biden, who has often connected to people through grief after suffering deep losses in his own life, spent time with the Floyd family in private on Monday.
“No child should have to ask the question that too many black children have had to ask for generations: ‘Why? Why is Daddy gone?’” Mr. Biden said in the video. “When there is justice for George Floyd, we will truly be on our way to racial justice in America.”
Mayor Sylvester Turner of Houston announced from the altar that he would sign an executive order on Tuesday to ban police chokeholds and strangleholds. Among other things, the order would also require police officers to give a warning before shooting.
“We honor him today because when he took his last breath, the rest of us will now be able to breathe,” said Mr. Turner, who is black.
No one mentioned President Trump, but Representative Al Green, Democrat of Texas, said that the next person in the country’s highest office needed to tackle racial inequality. And Brooklyn Williams, a young niece of Mr. Floyd’s, called for an end to hate crimes.
“Someone said, ‘Make America great again,’ but when has America ever been great?” she said. “America, it is time for a change!”
Mr. Sharpton began his eulogy with a warning that people — especially elected officials — tend to forget about police killings before officers have been brought to trial. Often, he said, bad police officers are “protected by wickedness in high places.”
The officer who pressed his knee into Mr. Floyd’s neck, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He and three other officers who participated in the arrest have been fired, and the other men were arrested on lesser charges.
Mr. Sharpton promised to be back in Minneapolis when the trial starts, and to march on Washington “by the tens of thousands” on the anniversary of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech in August.
One by one, Mr. Sharpton named the relatives of other black men and women whose killings have invoked concerns over racial injustice and asked them to stand. Other mourners stood, too, until everyone in the sanctuary was up and clapping and the funeral of one man briefly became a funeral for all the other lives lost.
“The mother of Trayvon Martin, will you stand,” he said. “The mother of Eric Garner, will you stand. The sister of Botham Jean, will you stand. The family of Pamela Turner, here in Houston, will you stand. The father of Michael Brown from Ferguson, Mo., will you stand. The father of Ahmaud Arbery, will you stand.
“All of these families came to stand with this family because they know better than anyone else the pain they will suffer from the loss that they have gone through,” Mr. Sharpton said.
Most mourners and public officials attending the funeral wore face masks. But the coronavirus pandemic at times seemed an afterthought. Among the hundreds of people inside the sanctuary and outside in the parking lot, people hugged, shook hands and passed funeral programs and business cards.
“I see that you all have destroyed all laws of social distancing,” joked the Rev. William Lawson, pastor emeritus of Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church in Houston.
After the service, Mr. Floyd’s body was carried out of the church toward the final, private observances at the cemetery. His body was borne by horse-drawn carriage along the final stretch of the route, with the public permitted to gather along the roadside and watch.
“You called for Mama,” Mr. Sharpton said during his eulogy. “We’re going to lay your body next to hers.”
A group of activists and Houston-area residents stood outside the church throughout the funeral — a much smaller gathering than the thousands who flocked to the church on Monday for the visitation.
Before the service began, a young man and woman walked up to the bouquets of flowers left by mourners at the church’s front doors, beneath a framed picture of Mr. Floyd. They knelt and prayed, and the young man raised his fist high.
The man, Arion Ford, 27, a community organizer from the St. Louis area who is a friend of the Floyd family, choked back tears as he stood up.
“I was praying for Mr. Floyd,” Mr. Ford said. “In my mind, I’m thinking, that could be my father, that could be my cousin, my brother. It could happen to any one of us. We are fed up, as you see out on the streets.”
His friend, Trisha Boyle, 29, a community activist also from St. Louis, said Mr. Floyd’s death had started a movement.
“We go to school,” she said. “I have two master’s degrees. Arion is studying to be a lawyer. We do the American dream. There’s this one piece that’s missing — we’re murdered. We’re murdered if we’re jogging. We’re murdered if we just so happen to have a counterfeit bill. Is that a death penalty?”
Later, as Mr. Floyd’s coffin was wheeled out of the church, a man standing in the back of the group of onlookers shouted, “We will breathe!” Another yelled, “Get your knee off our neck!”
The two rows of police officers stood to the side. As the coffin was lifted into the hearse, a chant broke out: “Say his name! George Floyd! Say his name! George Floyd!”
Manny Fernandez reported from Houston, and Patricia Mazzei from Miami.

MACCALLUM: I got it. Thank you, Bill. I am happy to have you with us. I've got to go. ""The Story"" is ending tonight for October 29th. We'll see you back here tomorrow night.
Thanks for being here, everybody.
TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. I spent a lot of the day on the phone with UPS trying to figure out what happened to our package that we overnighted on Monday. We got some answers, we are missing others. We'll get to that in just a minute.
But first, the big picture we've been reporting on for quite some time. It's been obvious for really decades now that the Biden family has gotten rich from selling influence abroad. Joe Biden held a series of high level jobs in the U.S. government -- Senator, Vice President. Based on that fact, and that fact alone, Biden's son and brother approach foreign governments and companies, sovereign wealth funds, energy conglomerates, third-world oligarchs and dictators, and they offered to exchange favors from Joe Biden for cash.
The polite term for that practice is influence peddling. Sometimes it is legal under American law, sometimes it is not legal. But it has always been the economic engine of the Biden family. They've never done anything else.
Until recently, no one debated this fact. Several liberal news organizations in fact have written detailed stories about the Biden's secret business dealings over the years. Look them up, assuming you still can.
It's only since Joe Biden received the Democratic nomination that anyone in the media has claimed otherwise.
This week we introduced you to one of the Biden family's former business partners, a man called Tony Bobulinski. Bobulinski confirmed more conclusively than anyone ever has what the Biden's have been doing.
On two separate occasions, Bobulinski met personally with Joe Biden to discuss the family's business deals in China. Biden repeatedly has denied knowing anything about those deals.
Joe Biden is lying, Tony Bobulinski proved it.
It was a major story and not just because it happened here. We only interviewed Tony Bobulinski in the first place, because nobody else would. There was a complete media blackout on his story, and there still is.
In the last three days, and we just checked, the name Tony Bobulinski has not been mentioned a single time on any other television network, not one time.
Finally, today, it fell to an anchor on a small financial news called Cheddar to bring up the story. Here is his exchange with the Biden campaign spokesman.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
J.D. DURKIN, CHEDDAR NEWS ANCHOR: There were more accusations made this week on that most watched FOX News interview a couple nights ago from Tucker Carlson. Did those meetings happen, as they had been alleged when Joe Biden was a private citizen?
JAMAL BROWN, NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY FOR THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN: We're not going to waste any time on this smear campaign because it just another distraction, to distract again, from four years of Donald Trump's reckless policies and his failed leadership.
And I'm not going to accept the premise of the question. We have five days to keep our eyes on the prize. And again, that is to vote Joe Biden as the next President of the United States.
DURKIN: OK, fair enough.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: ""We're not going to waste any time on the smear campaigns,"" says the spokesman. In other words, we don't feel like answering a simple fact- based question of relevance to voters in the days before an election, so we're not going to. We're not embarrassed to admit that we're not going to because no one has the courage to make us answer, including you. ""Fair enough,"" says the anchor.
There you have it, the state of the American news media in October 2020. Keep in mind, the anchor you just saw, Mr. Fair Enough, is still one of the bravest people in journalism. At least he asked -- sort of. The rest of them pretend it's not really a story. But it is a story and it's not going away.
Tonight, James Rosen of Sinclair confirmed that the F.B.I. opened a criminal investigation into the Biden family, quote, ""Hunter Biden and Associates"" last year, apparently on suspicion of money laundering. That investigation is still underway tonight.
Less than a week before an election, we learn this. What else will we learn? Well, very little if the people in charge have their way. Our professional class has dismissed from day one the revelations about the Biden family as part of a Russian Intel operation.
There's no evidence for that no matter how many people repeat it. There never has been evidence there never will be evidence. It is totally untrue. And yet the public is buying it anyway, we are sad to report.
Voters have been cut off from the facts which of course is the point of shutting down the free flow of information. When all the news receive is manufactured propaganda, you are apt to believe it and why wouldn't you believe it? You have no alternative.
Here are the effects. A new Harris survey out today conducted by longtime democratic pollster Mark Penn found that 51 percent of respondents, the majority believe ""The New York Post"" is disseminating, quote ""Russian disinformation.""
It's hard to imagine a scarier or more depressing result than that. You assume the ""Today"" show and ""The View"" and the rest of it is just harmless garbage, but it's not harmless. They are liars and their lies have consequences.
How do you maintain a Democratic system when reality itself has been banned? That's something we're going to have to figure out.
Glenn Greenwald has thought a lot about that question. Greenwald is a traditional leftist. He has committed above all to forcing transparency on people who hold power.
Years ago, Greenwald co-founded a news site called ""The Intercept."" Today, he resigned.
In a statement, Greenwald explained why, quote, ""'The Intercepts' editors in violation of my contractual right of editorial freedom, censored an article I wrote this week, refusing to publish it unless I removed all sections critical of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, the candidate vehemently supported by all New York based 'Intercept' editors involved in this effort at suppression."" And he went on.
Greenwald's full statement is up tonight at an internet platform called Substack, which has not yet censored. No matter who you plan to vote for next week, we recommend that you read it. Glenn Greenwald joins us tonight.
Glenn, thanks so much for coming on. The idea of you resigning from a news organization you have found is stunning. Tell us why you did.
GLENN GREENWALD, RESIGNED CO-FOUNDER, THE INTERCEPT: Well, the news organization that a co-created was in 2013, at the height of the Snowden reporting. I left ""The Guardian"" to do it, because I was seeing that there were a lot of constraints imposed on journalism and their ability, our ability to report freely against governments, against power centers, against all kinds of institutions that wield authority.
And the premise of the news outlet, the core overarching premise, the reason it was created was to ensure that journalists would always have complete journalistic independence and editorial freedom, never have to pull punches journalistically or pay homage to pieties, because of the preferences, the partisan or ideological preferences of editors, or anybody else. That was the core founding idea and vision.
And then that is what makes it so amazing that at the very outlet that I co-created that was built on my reputation, my credibility, my journalistic accomplishments, then tried to intervene to censor me six days before an election, because I wanted to publish reporting and analysis about the evidence that raises serious questions about the conduct of the candidate that all of the editors out that outlet vehemently and enthusiastically support.
CARLSON: I would imagine that some of our viewers don't read ""The Intercept."" You live outside our country, which is one of the reasons I think you say what you think is true. Tell us what this portends for the future here in the United States.
GREENWALD: So ""The Intercept"" was actually for a while, a unique publication, and I think the vision I just described is one reason, but another was that it was intended above all else to be highly skeptical of the claims of Intelligence Agencies.
At the time when we were doing the reporting, the attacks were coming from the N.S.A., the C.I.A., and the Deep State against me and against my source, Edward Snowden and against the reporting. And we knew they were lying constantly and disseminating propaganda in a very powerful way. So we set out to say, we're going to investigate them. We are going to be skeptical of them. We are going to subject their assertions to critical scrutiny.
And I am so embarrassed and angered that the media outlet that I created along with two other excellent journalists to do that, the only article it published about all of these documents that have emerged about Joe Biden other than a column of mine, where I denounced Facebook and Twitter for censoring it was an article that made reference in passing to those documents, very snidely and dismissively to say that no one should pay attention to it, because it was Russian disinformation.
And it cited a letter from John Brennan, James Clapper, Mike Hayden, and the rest of the goons from the C.I.A. and the Intelligence Community asserting it and where still that letter said we have no evidence that Russia is involved in any of this. ""The Intercept"" omitted that phrase, simply cited that letter to try and encourage people to ignore this evidence on the grounds that Russia had manufactured it and that the evidence was fabricated, even though there's never been any evidence that that's been true and everything since has just proven it showing Russia was not involved in any of this. And nobody, certainly not even Joe Biden disputes that these e-mails and other text messages are completely real and authentic.
CARLSON: It's horrifying. So, what you're watching is agencies of the U.S. government, turning their awesome and unconstrained powers against the American population.
GREENWALD: This is the real story of the last four years of the Trump administration, which is that for a long time, on the left, there was a healthy skepticism of the C.I.A.
CARLSON: Yes.
GREENWALD: There was a lot of anti-war activism in the Bush and Cheney years. That has all disappeared. And the reason it's disappeared is because the C.I.A. from the very first days of the Trump administration, even before he was inaugurated, devoted themselves to sabotaging the administration because Donald Trump questioned just a few of their pieties, and that can't be done in Washington and whoever does that must be destroyed.
And so the C.I.A. and the Deep State operatives became heroes of the liberal left. The people who support the Democratic Party, they are now in a full union with the neocons, the Bush-Cheney operatives, the C.I.A., Silicon Valley, and Wall Street. That is the union of power along with mainstream media outlets that are fully behind the Democratic Party which is likely to at least take over one branch of government, if not all of them in the coming election.
And that is a very alarming proposition because they are authoritarian. They believe in censorship, and they believe in suppression of information that exposes them in any kind of a critical light.
CARLSON: For a U.S. government agency to try and disseminate propaganda within the United States, I mean, is there any clearer attack on democracy than that?
GREENWALD: So when we were doing the Snowden reporting, one of the things that brought -- induced Edward Snowden to come forward, someone who had worked in the C.I.A. and the N.S.A. was his anger and horror that the tools of the N.S.A. had been turned on the American people.
They are supposed to spy on foreign adversary governments, but they weren't. They were collecting our phone records. Same with the C.I.A. They are trained disinformation agents, that's what they do. They lie for a living.
But they are supposed to do that in other countries where we want to induce some sort of change, overthrow a government, topple a regime, whatever, quote-unquote, ""interference,"" the U.S. government wants to do the way we are all so upset that Russia did in 2016. That's what they are trained to do.
The law though, and the obvious foundational prohibition on having a security state -- a national security state after World War II was it was never supposed to be turned domestically. They weren't supposed to be involved in our politics or disseminating propaganda.
Go turn on any of those other cable networks or pick up the op-ed page of any of the biggest newspapers and all you'll see are ex-members of the C.I.A., the D.O.J., the F.B.I., the N.S.A., telling Americans what they ought to believe.
They have infiltrated the means of communication domestically. They do it through leaks. They do it through clandestine operations and through lies. They propagandize the American people in a way that is incredibly dangerous no matter what your ideology is.
CARLSON: I totally agree and I'm ashamed of the times that I made apologies for those agencies for this behavior. I really am.
You are telling the truth. That's really clear. Glenn Greenwald, congratulations on getting out of there. Good to see you.
GREENWALD: Thank you, Tucker. Appreciate it.
CARLSON: Mark Morgan is the Acting Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. On Wednesday, Twitter banned him -- hard to imagine a head of an agency being banned on social media, but it did, and it did so for engaging in quote, ""hateful conduct.""
So what did Mark Morgan do exactly? What did he write that was so dangerous, so vile that you should never be allowed to hear from him again?
Well, he wrote this, quote: ""C.B.P. (Customs and Border Patrol) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers continue to build new wall every day. Every mile help stop gang members, murderers, sexual predators and drugs from entering our country. It's a fact, walls work.""
You might disagree with Mark Morgan on policy, maybe you don't like Donald Trump. But how is that false exactly? Ask the many other countries around the world that have built walls? Why do they do that? That's true.
So maybe there was some mistake. Maybe Twitter did this by accident. So Mark Morgan appealed his ban. And here's what Twitter wrote back to him, quote, ""Our support team has determined that a violation did take place, and therefore we will not overturn our decision. You will not be able to access Twitter."" End quote.
In other words, we banned you on purpose. Truth is not a defense in this country. If we don't like what you're saying or its political effect, we will silence you.
So there wasn't inevitably news coverage of this. After 20 hours, Twitter reversed its decision claiming as Twitter always does, it was a big misunderstanding, quote, ""After reviewing your account, it looks like we made an error."" But they didn't make an error. They showed us who we know they are.
Mark Morgan is the Acting Commissioner, as we said, of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. He is currently along the Rio Grande where a section of the wall is being built.
Mark, great to see you tonight.
MARK MORGAN, ACTING COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION: You, too, Tucker. Thanks for having me.
CARLSON: So, how does it feel to live in a country where someone who runs an agency expresses a fact-based opinion and finds himself censored?
MORGAN: I didn't understand. I didn't think I was living in America. I mean, what happened to me, Tucker, should scare every American citizen right now. They really should be listening to your show, and Tucker, let's be clear, this wasn't about that tweet. That was just a vehicle that they used.
What they were trying to censor was my message that I've been trying to get to the American people about how successful this President has been by providing us not only the tools like the wall system behind me, but also the network of policies that allowed us to effectively absolutely be successful in addressing the illegal migration crisis we had last year.
And I've been equally as vocal on the critics whose policies want to undo all of that, Tucker, and which actually would end up with absolutely open borders. We wouldn't just have another illegal immigration crisis that would have -- that would result in an illegal invasion. That is what they are trying to censor. That is the truth they are trying to keep from the American people.
CARLSON: Not to mention the humanitarian disaster. But isn't a discussion of public policy sacrosanct? Isn't that why we have a First Amendment so people can express their political views so we can openly debate the best course forward for the country? I mean, you were making a public policy argument, were you not?
MORGAN: That's exactly right, and I'll stand behind what my policy argument is based on facts, statistical analysis and historical trends. But that's exactly right.
This is exactly the type of debate we should be having right now. But Twitter did what they did on purpose. Let's make no mistake about it. With just a few days before the election, they knew what they were doing intentionally.
And now after they did it, after they got their hand caught in the cookie jar, it is disingenuous, saying they made an error. Though the only reason why they reversed it is because it went viral and got national attention. That's the truth.
CARLSON: Right. If they are doing that to you, imagine what they're doing to people with less power.
Mark Morgan, thanks so much for joining us. I appreciate it.
MORGAN: You bet. Thanks for having me, Tucker.
CARLSON: Last night, we told you part of a very weird story about how we sent documents, primary documents relevant to the Biden family from New York to Los Angeles and they went missing.
Well, today UPS returned the flash drive that disappeared in this new envelope, not in the original envelope. But what they didn't include was an explanation for what happened.
What have we learned about that? We've spent all day reporting on it. We will tell you straight ahead.
CARLSON: Last night, we told you about a pretty weird experience we had this week. On Monday, one of our producers in New York overnighted a package to our executive producer, Justin Wells and to me in Los Angeles where we were there preparing for an interview with the former Biden family business partner called Tony Bobulinski.
Somewhere along the way, the contents of that package disappeared. Inside it was a flash drive that contained primary documents pertaining to the Biden family. We should tell you those documents did not come from Tony Bobulinski, and of course, we made a copy of those files before we sent them because we're careful.
We get a lot of documents from a lot of different sources all the time, but that's especially true in election years. Before we put them on the air, we have to determine first whether they are real -- these were real -- whether they are newsworthy, and whether it's legal to show them. We wanted to assess what we have and we're still assessing it.
But the point is, the package never arrived. Proprietary reporting on the Biden family, documents sent between journalists by supposedly secure overnight mail disappeared. They vanished on the same day we were conducting a heavily publicized interview based in part on documents from the Biden family.
So as you can imagine, we wanted to know what happened. Unfortunately, we still don't know what happened.
This morning UPS issued a press release announcing they had found our flash drive and then boasting about their Customer Service, quote, ""UPS will always focus first on our customers and will never stop working to solve issues,"" which is fine. UPS is a reliable company. They rarely lose anything. We agree with that. That's why we use them in the first place.
And yet, they lost our Biden documents. How? UPS won't tell us how.
We spent a lot of the day talking to executives there. They claimed that the flash drive was found on Monday night by an hourly employee at the UPS building on 43rd Street in Manhattan. They suggested it might have been sitting on the floor there.
They couldn't prove that because remarkably, in a room where millions of high value packages are handled, there are no security cameras. That's what they told us.
UPS says the employee who found our flash drive simply dropped it on top of a supervisor's desk. Our documents sat there undiscovered for more than 24 hours until we announced on television that they were missing. That's their story.
Obviously, we had some questions about it. But UPS executives did not answer our questions, quote, ""There are no more details. Security is returning it. Apologies again that we were unable to deliver it next day at the service level you requested.""
Our exchanges went on like this for hours, and the main question we had never changed. How did our flash drive get separated from the package that we sent it in? That seemed like something worth knowing.
The envelope was securely sealed. We know that. Two witnesses saw our producer seal it and UPS does not dispute that. Was the package torn open accidentally by a machine? That seems unlikely. UPS says that almost never happens.
So we're left with the obvious explanation. Someone for some reason, opened our package and removed a flash drive containing documents that were damaging to the Biden family. We'd love to know who would do that and why. It would be helpful to see the envelope itself, but UPS says we can't see it because they threw it away.
So here we are. We got our flash drive back today, and that's great. But we'd really like are some answers.
And speaking of answers. It occurs as we are reading this that we mentioned, the documents that we get from a lot of people and we've received an awful lot of documents recently about Hunter Biden. We haven't aired all, in fact, many we have not aired. The ones that are pertinent to his business career abroad favors he did on behalf of foreign clients with the help of his father: that seems relevant and it seems like news and we brought it to you and we are not ashamed of that.
But there are a lot of documents about Hunter Biden's personal life that we haven't brought to you and we're not going to and we should tell you why. One is the obvious answer. He is not running for President, and so to the extent those documents pertain to his dad, of course.
But Hunter Biden is a fallen man at this point, and I should also say that I knew Hunter Biden fairly well. We lived near each other in Washington for quite some time. I knew his wife who is an absolutely outstanding person, a good person.
I never thought Hunter Biden was a bad person. I thought he had demons. But in the time I knew him, he kept them mostly under control. At some point he lost control of those demons and the world knows that now. He is now humiliated and alone.
It's probably too strong to say we feel sorry for Hunter Biden. But the point is, pounding on a man, jumping on, piling on, when he is already down is something that we don't want to be involved in.
So with that --
CARLSON: If you're into identity politics, classifying people by their immutable characteristics, you'd think Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation of the Supreme Court would be good news for women. A lot of people see the world that way.
But surprisingly, we know this is a shock, feminists who pretend to represent women are angry. That's weird. They don't want anyone celebrating Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation. The Girl Scouts learned that the hard way today.
Lisa Boothe is a FOX News contributor, a senior fellow for the Independent Women's Voice and she has that story for us tonight. Hey, Lisa.
LISA BOOTHE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Hi, Tucker. They sure did. So yesterday, the Girl Scouts sent out a tweet to congratulate Amy Coney Barrett for being the fifth woman confirmed to the Supreme Court. However, the backlash was swift, including from people like Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, so the Girl Scouts of course, caved.
They took the tweet down, and then they put out a statement saying that the tweet was viewed as partisan and political and they are a nonpartisan and nonpolitical organization. However, here's the kicker, Tucker, they have previously sent out support of Hillary Clinton in 2017, and even prior to that and they put out a tribute to the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
So as a former Girl Scout, the message is clear to young girls across the country and that message is, you don't count unless you're a liberal. And that's the same message that Hillary Clinton and her campaign sent in 2016 when Madeleine Albright said that there is a special place in hell for women that don't support Clinton. It's the same message that Joe Biden is sending to black voters that you aren't black if you don't support him.
So clearly, if you don't bow down to the altar of progressivism, you don't count to the left.
CARLSON: They clearly feel that way. But why do they have to wreck all of this country's institutions in the meantime? Like why wreck the Girl Scouts? It seems kind of a sweet group. What -- you know, you know what I mean? And why are people putting up with that?
BOOTHE: Well, and also, this is what I just think is so ironic, all of these people right now, when they point to Trump as the problem, but they say, why is America so divided? And then when you look at the NBA, you look at the Girl Scouts, everything is poison, but like everything is poisoned by progressive politics.
So that's why we're so divided, because you're essentially shutting out half of America from the equation. And that's the problem.
I mean, everything is tainted in America with politics and partisanship and we can't have anything nice anymore, and it has just ruined all the fun.
CARLSON: Well, politics does poison everything. It would be nice to have some nonpolitical, and some sincerely, nonpolitical institutions in this country, I think.
BOOTHE: I would like that.
CARLSON: Lisa Boothe with a smart point. Amen. Good to see you.
BOOTHE: Thank you, Tucker. Good to see you.
CARLSON: Well, if you look at the polls, the President is trailing, more in some places than others, leading in other places. But there's one demographic he seems to be making kind of remarkable progress with.
We are not making this up. Some of the world's most famous rappers are now sort of aligned with Trump. Kanye West, sort of. He has met with the President many times since he supports some of his policies. Of course, Zuby, probably the best-known rapper in the entire United Kingdom.
But this evening, we add another rap artist to the list, the musician, Lil Wayne. In case you're not a fan, his real name is Dwayne Carter, tweeted about an hour ago this, ""Just had a great meeting with Donald Trump. Besides what he's done so far with Criminal Justice Reform, the Platinum Plan is going to give the community real ownership. We listened to what he had to say today and assured he will and can get it done.""
Well, OK. What does that mean for the rest of us? What is the Platinum Plan that Lil Wayne is excited about?
Well, according to the White House, the Platinum Plan would address the issues on every voters' mind: things like making Juneteenth a Federal holiday and prosecuting the Ku Klux Klan, which some say still exists. Lil Wayne couldn't resist a plan like that. If there was ever a bellwether rapper, a one-man sign of how this election is going to go in the rap community, Lil Wayne is the guy. When you've lost Lil Wayne, you've lost Lil America.
Amazing. You can't make this year up. It's just too good.
Well, it's not just the presidency, of course on the line next week, it's the Senate, and so this is a topic we probably haven't spent enough time taking a look at. Tonight, what races should we be watching?
Dana Perino knows the answer to that and many other questions. She is the host, of course, ""The Daily Briefing,"" co-host of ""The Five."" Happy to see you tonight.
Dana, what should we -- those of us who have been focused on one race, what are the others we should look at?
DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, there are several, but we're going to -- we don't have enough time to get to all of them and be like, totally nerd out with me. But I think one thing to keep in mind overall, Tucker, is that there are very few ticket splitters left. That means that when people go to vote, they're voting straight Republican or straight Democrat. We used to get a little bit more ticket splitting in the past, but those days are kind of behind us.
But President Trump in this last week, obviously, he is working very hard to try to close this and that could really help make the difference between a Chuck Schumer or a Mitch McConnell-led senate next year.
I would start in Georgia. There are two Senate races in Georgia and Georgia has a system that if you don't get to 50 percent, you have to go to a runoff in January. Well, one of those races is definitely going to a run off. That is the Kelly Loeffler and Doug Collins race. They're not going to get to 50 percent.
The other one, though, is incumbent Senator David Perdue against Jon Ossoff. Now, this one is a lot closer. And I think that David Perdue, he has announced that he is not going to do the final debate with Jon Ossoff and instead will join President Trump at a rally on Sunday. That probably makes sense for him. He did not have a great debate the other night. And I also think that it shows that President Trump is not taking Georgia for granted. So Georgia is one that I would look at. I mean, the Republicans are a little nervous on that one.
Another one, Tucker, is Arizona. President Trump is going to be there on Tuesday. Trump and Biden both very much want to win Arizona. The senator there that's up for election is Martha McSally. That race is going to be tough, but she has a very good ground game probably better than any of the other Senate candidates. And she is bringing in Mike Lee and Ted Cruz to campaign for her this weekend.
However, that race -- however the President does there is probably how she will do there. So that one is one to watch.
The last one is North Carolina. Cal Cunningham is the Democrat. He is basically trying to take Thom Tillis out. Cal Cunningham is running on character, Tucker, and about a month ago, it surfaced and he has been having an extramarital affair and he has been trying to hide from the media and not talk about that. That now race is probably within one point. So North Carolina is another one to watch.
CARLSON: Interesting. And you think, finally that all three of the states will track the presidential results.
PERINO: I do think that they probably will. But I also want to mention one other one, just kind of a sleeper race that no one is really talking about. But take a look at John James up in Michigan. He is running -- he is the Republican. He is a black man who has been running real hard against the incumbent, Gary Peters.
Gary Peters doesn't have a great -- you know, he just doesn't have a great campaign. John James has a pretty exciting campaign and President Trump when he was there this week really gave him a lift, so they are also on the ticket together.
CARLSON: John James is an impressive guy. I think we had him on once. Great to see you. Dana Perino, thank you.
PERINO: Yes. OK, see you next week.
CARLSON: See you. Well, we've shown you footage of violence and looting, rioting in Philadelphia this week. It's going on for days in a swing state that could have an effect on the presidential election. Has anything changed? An update tonight from a reporter who was attacked during the riots in Philadelphia. That's next.
CARLSON: Philadelphia is a major city on the eastern seaboard, one of the oldest in the country, our former capital. It's in the State of Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania could be a swing state next week. All of that explains why the media are ignoring the rioting and the violence that have gone on in Philadelphia all week.
The police there were ordered to stand down is more than a thousand BLM activists -- Joe Biden voters and anarchists -- looted and destroyed businesses. A lot of people were shot, most of them are the looters.
Authorities only started to take action after they found a van full of explosives in the city. But Antifa and BLM did not stop attacking businesses. They also attacked the handful of reporters who tried to cover what was happening there.
As we showed you last night, they did it on camera.
[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]
CARLSON: Elijah Schaffer is the reporter you just saw being attacked on camera. He is with ""The Blaze."" He is reporting on the riots. He joins us tonight.
Elijah, thanks so much for coming on. I mean, what the hell? What country is -- where was that, by the way? Was that at a 7-Eleven?
ELIJAH SCHAFFER, THE BLAZE: No, that was actually a Five Below, so a discount store that sells $5.00 and under items.
CARLSON: Tell us the context for that.
SCHAFFER: Yes, so the police, I guarantee you they were told to stand down. They lost control of several city blocks. The law enforcement failed to not only stop a first round, but a second, a third round of looting across four or five different entire shopping centers.
These were not just little strip malls from the middle of America. This was a Walmart Super Center strip mall. This is something massive that you would think they would have Security Police that would make this a priority. But no, the police just stood by as people went into store after store after store.
And what's crazy is, as they cleared one store, then the rioters and looters would jump to the next and they just couldn't keep up with them.
CARLSON: So you're a reporter, you're doing your job, you're committing journalism in the middle of a riot. You got assaulted for doing it. Did all the journalist groups that committed to protect journalists, did they rush to your defense? Pay your medical bills? Demand justice?
SCHAFFER: Yes, no actually that's quite the opposite. I think if you saw the video down and according to a police officer I spoke to from the Philadelphia Department. You know one of the looters there had a gun and he pulled it out on me. You can see him briefly as you do a play by play.
So they came at me with a firearm. They came at me with a mob. They started attacking me. They immediately punched me in the face.
And what was interesting was, they were specifically targeting white journalists as there were other great journalists that were there that were people of color, but they were leaving them alone. And you see the racial divide in this country where, you know, it's not only not safe to be a reporter telling the truth, but also the racial tensions have made things very difficult in this country with the narratives that are being played.
I mean, the man had a gun, and I'll say this, I was lucky enough, I owe it to God and I give praise to Jesus for saving my life in that moment, because just right outside a few hundred yards away, or a hundred yards or so, a 15-year-old girl was shot, multiple guns were fired.
And so they had guns, they were using guns. But luckily for me, all I received was about a dozen or so blows to the head and the body.
CARLSON: This is happening because people are allowing it to happen, people in charge, and they should be ashamed, deeply ashamed of themselves. So nobody came to your defense. There wasn't an editorial in ""The New York Times"" that a racist mob attacked you, threatened you with a firearm, beat you up in the middle of a major American city?
SCHAFFER: That's a good question. I know ""The New York Times"" talked about people that they call the rightwing glorifying or exaggerating or hyper focusing on violence, and I have to say to someone at ""The New York Times"" who is sitting in their office that is, you know, writing in the comfortability of their flat.
You, writing and judging and characterizing, people look at my face. I mean, this is good. I'm a young man, I'm married. My wife is at home, and I'm just there capturing the news while they are not.
And they look at someone like myself and many other brave people who are putting their lives on the line, and they tell me, my face being beaten, a gun being pointed at my head, this is a second time, in just a few weeks that I have had a gun pulled out on me for reporting on these riots. You're telling me this is an exaggeration?
Well, you know, I'm taking blows for America and you're sitting there in your fancy desk and your nice salary telling us, real reporters, why we're wrong. And that's why I have a whole tell-all, you know, I have a show called ""Slightly Offensive"" that covers all of this. It is a Blaze TV show.
And tomorrow on YouTube, I'm going in the step by step because journalism is dead in this country and it's dangerous. And I know why the journalists don't go out there and do this. It's because it actually takes a risk. It requires sacrifice. And that's been lost today in our country, and it breaks my heart to realize that people are not getting truth. They are just getting opinion.
And the truth that's being set free out there by many brave and amazing independent and right-wing journalists, and even some independent and left- wing journalists, is being shut down by the corporate media companies, because they refuse to show to America what is really happening, and I think Americans deserve better this election season.
CARLSON: Yes, well, there are going to be consequences, too, because at some point, you know, people are going to take the law into their own hands. I don't want that. I don't think anyone does. But that's inevitable if they allow this kind of disorder to continue.
People are sick of it, and they have every reason to be. Elijah, I'm glad you're OK. Thanks for joining us.
SCHAFFER: Thank you.
CARLSON: So Twitter bans people for wrong think. How long before the Federal government does the same? Well, it is already happening in the U.K. New hate crimes laws and this is real legislation. It could allow police to arrest citizens for having quote, ""dangerous views in their own homes."" That's real. You should pay attention. We'll be right back.
CARLSON: Andrew Cuomo is the Governor of New York. He is the son of Mario Cuomo, the brother of a CNN anchor. Like all of the Cuomos, his personal life and his public life often intersect. That just happened. FOX's Rick Leventhal has the details on that story for us right now. Hey, Rick.
RICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: We're on the same page, Tucker, because New York's governor often talks about his love life, but when it comes to his daughter, it's apparently a hands off policy. ""The New York Post"" reports that a State Trooper assigned to the Governor's Security Detail got hot and heavy with 25-year-old Cara Kennedy Cuomo.
Trooper Dane Pfeiffer met the First Daughter while acting as bodyguard for her dad and the two began dating about seven months ago after she moved to the Governor's Mansion in Albany because of the coronavirus pandemic.
But ""The New York Post"" reports, Trooper Pfeiffer was soon transferred to a remote outpost near the Canadian border that was soon after the Governor found out about it. A law enforcement source told ""The Post"" that the transfer was due to quote, ""the protocol of dignitary protection."" But ""The Post"" also quotes the source saying the real reason is the governor didn't like whatever they were doing. And that is also an actual quote.
Apparently, there was no finding of misconduct Tucker, and the Trooper's record has not been tarnished. And here's the kicker, the Trooper bought a home near Albany and now has to commute 160 miles each way to work, something the cops call Highway Therapy, but whatever the Governor did or didn't do, didn't work because according to ""The Post,"" the two are still dating -- Tucker.
CARLSON: Good. Thank you, Rick. For the record, we are rooting for the lovebirds. This show stands for love.
LEVENTHAL: Well, any father can understand maybe perhaps the Governor's actions or inactions.
CARLSON: If only we all had the power of choice, we go with you. That's pretty good. Great to see you, Rick. Thank you.
LEVENTHAL: You, too. Thanks.
CARLSON: Now, a more ominous story and it comes from the U.K., from Scotland, where a lot of trends that we wind up living with do begin.
In Scotland, an ominously called Hate Crime and Public Order Bill now under consideration would allow the authorities to arrest people for things they say in their own homes at the dinner table. So why is a public order bill focused on what people do in private? That's a good question. And what exactly is hate speech? Since everyone is against it, does hate speech including praising a border wall?
Well, according to legislation, it would. Under this legislation, you would not be allowed to, quote, ""Stir up hatred of any kind."" You could be arrested, if you did. In other words, disagreeing with people would be a crime if those people had power.
So how long before we face laws like this in the United States? It is possible. Pedro Gonzalez is an Assistant Editor at ""American Greatness."" We're happy to have him on tonight. Peter, thanks for coming on.
So first, let's just define the terms because I think it's helpful to know what we're talking about, what is hate speech?
PEDRO GONZALEZ, ASSISTANT EDITOR, ""AMERICAN GREATNESS"": Hate speech is whatever the people prosecuting you for hate speech, say it is, and that sounds a little bit reductionist, but that's really what it comes down to.
It is an entirely subjective standard that these people think society ought to be organized around, and if you disagree, well, you're going to prison.
CARLSON: So if you allow the people in charge to define hate speech unchallenged, and we're allowing that here in this country, then what you're doing is handing them power over your mind, and crushing all dissent. Right?
GONZALEZ: Yes, that's exactly right. This is very dystopian. This is right out of Minority Report. It's basically pre-crime. We need to know what you're saying in the privacy of your home, so that those words cannot become actions. And, you know, we have to basically throw you in prison before you can act against some victim group.
Now, this stuff only goes one way. Of course, it's only ever directed at victim groups and it seems to always work against white people, whether it's in Europe or the United States. It has the exact opposite effect in my view. It is profoundly divisive because you're creating resentment in society for basically every group that's excluded from the protections of - - because let's say, supposedly, the hate speech ideal is sincere. We want to protect everyone from hate speech.
CARLSON: Right?
GONZALEZ: It would be still wrong, but at least somewhat understandable. But it's not like that. Only some groups deserve protections from speech, others do not. And I think it inches us closer towards a kind of war of all against all by inculcating this kind of resentment in people if it doesn't just crush them outright.
CARLSON: That is such a smart and subtle point. So what you're saying is, a law purportedly designed to suppress extremism causes it?
GONZALEZ: Yes, absolutely. When you tell people that because of their immutable characteristics, being born white, for example, or something like that that you need to be treated as a potential terrorist, and that we need to know what you're saying in the privacy of your home when you're talking to your friends and family. I mean that either that's either going to psychologically break you and make you kind of just a docile little automaton, which is, I think what these people would love on the one hand, or it's going to drive you towards extremism, which I think they would also love.
Because every time someone acts out like this, when they've been just driven mad, it feeds their narrative, like, see, here's proof, here's a justification for what we're doing, and now, we're going to ratchet it up a little bit more.
CARLSON: Well, why not just treat everyone the same and use the same standard for everyone? I mean, isn't that -- I thought that was the goal?
GONZALEZ: Right, well, that's what good people think, and that would make too much sense and it would be -- I think it would be too easy or we are not as contrived, I should say.
I think it's hard for decent people, for good people to look at this and see it for what it really is. Because again, on the surface, it's -- we're doing this to protect certain people -- but that's not really what it's about. It's really about power.
I think even calling it a double standard is mistaken. This is about enforcing a kind of hierarchy with the people that are enforcing and creating these laws, ostensibly to protect others, they are the ones obviously at the top of this. They are the ones that we need to give all the power to, so they can keep the rest of us safe.
CARLSON: That is a very, very smart and too rarely noted point. And I appreciate it. This causes extremism and it's really about power. That is exactly right.
Pedro Gonzalez, thanks for coming on tonight.
GONZALEZ: Thanks for having me.
CARLSON: We're out of time tonight. We'll be back at 8:00 p.m., tomorrow as always, the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink.
We have great news for you. Up next from New York, our friend, Sean Hannity takes over our 9:00 p.m."

In response to the officers involved being suspended, the ""entire Emergency Response Team has resigned from the team,"" News4Buffalo's Dave Greber tweeted Friday.
A total of 57 officers reportedly resigned as ""a show of support for the officers who are suspended without pay"" after shoving Gugino.
""They are still employed, but no longer on ERT,"" Greber added.
""The SWAT and Riot teams of the Buffalo Police Department have resigned their special assignments,"" a police source said, according to WHAM radio talk-show host Bob Lonsberry.
Cops who shoved the 75-year-old 'peace activist' to the ground should be fired and could face criminal charges, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said.
Speaking at his daily press briefing on Friday, Gov Cuomo recalled seeing the video of the push - showing the victim bleeding and unconscious on the sidewalk - and said it made him ""sick to his stomach.""
""You see that video and it disturbs your basic sense of decency and humanity. Why? Why was that necessary?
""An older gentleman. Where was the threat? And then you just walk by the person when you see blood coming from his head.
""It's just fundamentally offensive and frightening. It's just frightening.""
Blood could be seen coming from the elderly man's head after he was knocked to the ground on Thursday night.
The victim, later identified as Martin Gugino was taken to the hospital after the incident in serious condition but its now ""alert and oriented,"" according to Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz.
Cuomo discussed the recent string of violence following the death of George Floyd after Officer Derek Chauvin was filmed kneeling on his neck during an arrest.
He said: ""Who are we, how did we get to this place? Incidents of pushing the press, incidents of police getting hit with bricks in the head. And these are undeniable situations.""
Cuomo then urged that the city fire the officers involved.
""I think the district attorney should look at the situation for possible criminal charges,"" Cuomo added.
Now Cuomo is pushing for the ""Say Their Name"" Reform Agenda, which is set to pass next week.
The agenda would push to ban chokeholds, make false race-bace 911 calls classified as a hate crime, allow transparency of disciplinary records for officers under investigation, and make the Attorney General an independent prosecutor for police murders.
""Reform works for everyone's interest here. Stopping police abuse vindicates the overwhelming majority of police who are there to do the right thing and do the right thing every day."" Cuomo said.
""It restores the confidence, the respect and the trust that you need to make this relationship work.""
The two officers were suspended by Buffalo Police Commissioner Byron Lockwood after they were caught on video shoving Gugino to the ground.
A full Internal Affairs investigation is pending after the disturbing footage emerged on Thursday.
One of the officers involved in Thursday night's incident has been identified as Aaron Torgalski.
Video, originally obtained by radio station WFBO, shows the officers pushing the man to the ground.
One cop uses a baton, while the other one extended his arm to knock down Gugino.
The disturbing clip shows Gugino approach a crowd of officers in Niagara Square this evening before he is roughly pushed out of their way by at least two of them.
He stumbles back, falls to the ground, and appears to be knocked out as shouts of ""he's bleeding out of his ears"" can be heard and bystanders urged someone to call an ambulance.
When one officer attempts to bend down and check on the injured man, he is pulled back by his colleague.
WBFO reported that the man is now in a stable condition at ECMC in Buffalo after the brutal interaction with the cops."

Purpose and Summary
The need to fight domestic terrorism in America is increasingly urgent. Over the course of the 116th Congress, the Committee has investigated this issue, including conducting a hearing entitled ""Hate Crimes and the Rise of White Nationalism"" on April 9, 2019. In the hearing witnesses highlighted Congress' critical role in addressing the disturbing increase in white supremacist violence, provided examples of how hate groups have proliferated inside the United States, and detailed how social media platforms have become dangerous recruiting tools in the white nationalist movement.
Additionally, the Committee heard testimony from communities that have been systematically targeted by white nationalist groups. Since that time a number of additional horrific white supremacist attacks have occurred./1/
The shooting spree at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, last August, which left 22 people dead and 24 more wounded, marked the deadliest attack in modern times against the Latino community in the United States./2/ The El Paso attack was also the third deadliest act of violence by a domestic extremist in more than 50 years./3/
In addition, since the deadly rampage at Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue, at least 16 white supremacists have been arrested for their alleged roles in terrorist plots, attacks or threats against the Jewish community./4/ And, over the last decade, right-wing extremists have been responsible for 75 percent of all domestic extremist-related murders./5/ These attacks are a stark demonstration of the threat white supremacist organizations pose.

With three-fourths of all domestic terrorist attacks coming from white supremacists, the federal government must allocate its resources to the most deadly threats. H.R. 5602 authorizes the collection of data, call for the results of the data collection to be published, and requires the FBI to focus its resources on the greatest threats. Additionally, H.R. 5602 authorizes the creation of three offices, one each within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), to monitor, investigate and prosecute cases of domestic terrorism. The newly created offices will provide Congress joint biannual reports assessing the state of domestic terrorism threats, with a specific focus on white supremacists.
Background and Need for the Legislation
I. DOJ'S HATE CRIMES & DOMESTIC TERRORISM ENFORCEMENT REGIMEN
The DOJ was created in the post-Civil War era, motivated, at least in part, by Congress' intent to enforce the Reconstruction Amendments and to have an entity within the Executive Branch to serve as a ""champion"" of civil rights./6/
To this day, DOJ serves as the Nation's chief law enforcement organization and carries out the United States' efforts to protect civil rights and it does so through various divisions, sections, and offices. The FBI's Criminal Investigative Division (CID) investigates cases involving a variety of criminal statutes that make it illegal to interfere with any person who is participating in a federally protected activity, such as public education, employment, jury service, travel, or the enjoyment of public accommodations, or helping another person to do so, based on their race or perceived race./7/
CID also investigates crimes allegedly committed because of the actual or perceived religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability of any person, where the crime occurred within a federal jurisdiction./8/

The Department's manner of prosecuting terrorism cases has changed substantially in the last 20 years. Before the September 11th attacks, the United States generally distinguished international and domestic terrorism matters by the type of alleged perpetrator. The FBI labeled foreign-born or foreign-based terrorists as ""international terrorists,""
while federal authorities considered acts of domestic terror as a subset of criminal behavior./11/
Following the September 11th attacks, Congress enacted the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (Patriot Act), which ushered in a dramatic shift in law enforcement authority./12/ Title VIII of the Patriot Act changed the definition of domestic terrorism, added a number of crimes to the list of those labeled terrorism, and criminalized cyberterrorism.

In 2005, the FBI established the National Security Branch (NSB) to merge its Counterterrorism Division, Counterintelligence Division, Directorate of Intelligence, Weapons of Mass Destruction Directorate, and Terrorist Screening Center. Only a year later, the DOJ created the National Security Division (NSD), which similarly brought together prosecution-focused counterterrorism operations and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) litigation sections. The NSB and NSD form the vanguard of the Nation's efforts to prevent and prosecute terrorism cases.
In the last year, the FBI has changed the way it approaches domestic terrorism. In his testimony to the Senate Homeland Security Committee in 2019, FBI Director Christopher Wray, noted that terrorism, including domestic terrorism, remains the FBI's primary focus./13/
Director Wray noted that white supremacists constitute the largest share of domestic terrorists and that white supremacists have perpetrated the ""most lethal"" attacks in the last few years./14/
According to Director Wray, the FBI arrested 107 individuals during fiscal year 2019 in connection with domestic terrorism investigations, which was ""close to the same number on the international terrorism front.""/15/ At any given time, the FBI has ""about 900 [open] domestic terrorism investigations,"" a ""huge chunk"" of which ""involve racially motived violent extremists.""/16/ Of these, the most lethal ""over the last few years"" have involved white supremacists./17/

II. HATE CRIMES AND DOMESTIC TERRORISM STATUTORY AUTHORITIES
Federal law defines domestic terrorism as involving acts that are ""dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State; appear to be intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.""/18/
--
/18/18 U.S.C Sec. 2331(5) (2018).
While domestic terrorism is defined in federal law, the definition does not accompany an associated crime or prohibitive behavior. Rather, absent an explicit crime prohibiting domestic terrorism, federal authorities charge terrorism acts, whether domestic or international in nature, under two laws that prohibit terrorism-related acts. The first statute, which passed in 1994, criminalizes material support of one of 57 underlying terrorism-related crimes./19/
--
/19/18 U.S.C. Sec. 2339A (2018); 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2332b(g) (2018).
Of 57 predicate terrorism offenses referenced in Section 2339A of Title 18 of the United States Code federal prosecutors may use 51 of the offenses to charge domestic terrorism./20/
The underlying predicate terrorism crimes include: maliciously damaging, destroying by means of fire or explosive any building or personal property used in interstate or foreign commerce;/21/ hostage taking;/22/ or willful or malicious destruction of any of the works, property, or material of any communication line, station, or system./23/ While the vast majority of those charged under Sec. 2339A have been internationally based, DOJ has charged at least four individuals for domestic crimes under these statutes./24/ The FBI also uses a second statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2339B, to investigate international terrorism. Despite the international focus of section 2339B, DOJ has also charged domestically based United States citizens under this statute./25/

III. CONGRESSIONAL REPORTING DEFICIENCIES
From the mid-1980s through the 2000s, the FBI issued an annual report, Terrorism, which provided insight on both domestic and international terrorist threats./31/ Despite its great value, the publication was discontinued in 2005, leaving a dearth of clearly tracked information. In February 2019, House Homeland Security Committee Chairman, Bennie Thompson, and House Judiciary Committee Chairman, Jerrold Nadler, sent a letter to FBI Director Wray, inquiring about the discontinuation of this reporting./32/
In a March 27, 2019 response, Director Wray cited ""resource allocation issues"" as the reason for its discontinuation./33/

IV. ""BLACK IDENTITY EXTREMIST"" DESIGNATION
During Attorney General Jeff Sessions' tenure, the FBI's counterterrorism intelligence gathering came under heavy criticism. In an August 2017 Intelligence Assessment (Assessment) the FBI's Counterterrorism Division designated ""Black Identity Extremists"" as a modern iteration of groups such as the Black Liberation Army, which was involved in a number of violent incidents in the 1970s. Based on a number of high-profile cases involving police use of force against African-American individuals, the FBI speculated in the Assessment--which was leaked to the press--that there may be a resurgence of attacks by what the FBI gave the new label ""Black Identity Extremists.""/34/ Civil rights and civil liberties groups roundly criticized the Assessment, both for the rhetoric it used, and for the FBI's apparent unwarranted focus on protest groups largely made up of African Americans./35/
The Congressional Black Caucus also expressed concerns, including that the Assessment conflated black Americans exercising free speech with violent extremism./36/ There are no specific ""black identity extremist"" groups named in the report nor did the report describe any shared ideology or name any leaders. The report further reinforced repeated concerns voiced by advocates that the FBI was unnecessarily surveilling leaders in Black Lives Matter protests.

In April 2019, the FBI notified Congressional staff that it was modifying how it categorized hate crimes incidents. In his testimony before the House Judiciary Committee in February 2020, Director Wray confirmed that the FBI has collapsed the previous nine categories it used to identify hate crime incidents into four categories./37/
The new categories are: (1) racially-motivated violent extremism; (2) anti-government/antiestablishment extremism; (3) animal rights and environmental extremism; and (4) abortion extremism. Director Wray also described an additional category, ""other domestic terrorism,"" which would encompass, for instance, attempted mail bombings./38/

V. WHITE SUPREMACY IN THE MILITARY
Servicemember participation in white supremacist organizations dates back to a time well before 1948, when President Truman ordered the integration of the military branches./39/ The Ku Klux Klan openly recruited members of the military through the 1980s./40/ In 1986, the Defense Department began efforts to stem servicemembers' participation in white supremacist organizations when Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger ordered military personnel to reject these organizations./41/ Commanders inconsistently applied the 1986 directive, thus allowing some white supremacists to continue to serve./42/
After the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, the Department of Defense explicitly banned servicemembers from participating in white supremacist organizations./43/ This policy largely remains in place.

Recent attacks by former servicemembers have brought renewed attention to the military's response to white supremacists within its ranks. In November 2015, Frazier Miller was sentenced to death on murder charges after he killed three people during an April 13, 2014, attack on a Jewish community center facilities in Overland Park, Kansas./44/
Miller served 20 years in the U.S. Army, including 13 years as a Green Beret, and later went on to found a chapter of the Ku Klux Klan./45/ Wade Michael Page, an Army veteran and an avowed white supremacist, killed six Sikh worshipers in a 2012 attack of the gurdwara (Sikh temple) in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, and was reportedly radicalized while in uniform./46/
More recently, a number of then-current and former servicemembers were linked in 2017 to the Atomwaffen Division, a violent white supremacist group./47/ Yet, the Department of Defense (DoD) reported to Congress that only 18 servicemembers have been discharged for extremist activity over the past five years./48/
A recent poll of servicemembers by the Military Times found that more than one-third of active-duty troops and more than half of servicemembers of color said that they have witnessed examples of white nationalism or ideologically driven racism within the ranks./49/

On February 11, 2020, the House Subcommittee on Military Personnel held a hearing, entitled ""Alarming Incidents of White Supremacy in the Military--How to Stop It?,"" on white supremacy in the U.S Armed Forces. Employees of the Department of Defense and various branches of the Armed Services, as well as researchers specializing in military extremism testified about the rise in white supremacist ideology among both active and retired servicemen and women./50/
During the hearing, DoD representatives from the criminal investigations divisions of the represented military branches acknowledged that their respective agencies do not generally pursue investigations into military personnel who are members of, or who share the ideologies of, extremist groups. They testified that investigations are opened only when instances of activity or active participation (fundraising, attending rallies, having tattoos, etc.) in these white supremacist or extremist ideologies are identified./51/
Even in those circumstances, where the DoD confirms active participation, removal from military service is not required./52/

Although Reeves was initially only demoted for his white supremacist activities, an Air Force administrative discharge board recommended his discharge from service in February of 2020./53/ The Marine Corps has faced issues as well, dishonorably discharging a number of Marines who have been found espousing white supremacist beliefs over the past few years, including an individual who, online, had praised Nazis and discussed running over demonstrators./54/

VI. WHITE SUPREMACY IN LAW ENFORCEMENT
White supremacists have long sought to infiltrate law enforcement agencies./55/ According to a leaked document drafted by the FBI Counter Terrorism Division, infiltration by members of white supremacist groups continues to pose a threat to law enforcement agencies around the country./56/ Currently, there is no federal database that tracks attempts by white supremacists to infiltrate law enforcement agencies. In the absence of formal tracking, several organizations and media outlets published investigative findings on law enforcement officers who have engaged in racist, nationalist, or white supremacists activity./57/ These efforts have uncovered hundreds of white supremacists who are currently employed or retired law enforcement and have prompted agencies across the nation to open internal inquiries into officer conduct, in some instances leading to termination of employment./58/

More recently, following the death of George Floyd on May 25, 2020, law enforcement agencies have faced additional scrutiny, with particular focus on the presence of racism and white supremacy among some law enforcement officers. A number of published reports have discovered examples of law enforcement officers who espouse white supremacist beliefs. One such example that has received nationwide attention involves three law enforcement officers in Wilmington, North Carolina, who made racist remarks on tape and urged civil strife./59/

Hearings
In compliance with section 103(i) of House Resolution 6, On April 9, 2019, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing titled, ""Hate Crimes and the Rise of White Nationalism,"" to investigate the recent spread of white identity ideology, the effect white nationalist groups have had on impacted communities, and the increase in domestic terrorist acts motivated by hate.
Committee Consideration
On March 11, 2020, the Committee met in open session and ordered the bill, H.R. 5602, favorably reported, an amendment in the nature of a substitute with one additional amendment, by a recorded vote of 24 to 2, a quorum being present.
Committee Votes
In compliance with clause 3(b) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Committee advises that the following votes occurred during the Committee's consideration of H.R. 5602.
1. An amendment by Mr. Buck to supplement the finding section of the bill by adding a number of additional examples of extremist violence and in requiring the FBI to consider Antifa, anarchists, fascist, socialists, ant-Semites, and black supremacists in making the threat assessments required by the H.R. 5602, was defeated by a rollcall vote of 19 to 9.
2. An amendment by Mr. Reschenthaler that would have added to a number of the bill's sections that require federal agencies to specifically review neo-Nazis, Antifa, and other violent hate organizations when assessing threats, was defeated by a rollcall vote of 16 to 10.
3. Motion to report H.R. 5602, as amended, favorably was agreed to by a rollcall vote of 24 to 2.
Committee Oversight Findings
In compliance with clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Committee advises that the findings and recommendations of the Committee, based on oversight activities under clause 2(b)(1) of rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives, are incorporated in the descriptive portions of this report. These include conclusions by the Committee following the February 5, 2020, oversight hearing on the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The sole witness during February 5, 2020, hearing was the Honorable Christopher A. Wray, Director of the FBI.
New Budget Authority and Tax Expenditures and Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate
With respect to the requirements of clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 308(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and with respect to requirements of clause (3)(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Committee has requested but not received a cost estimate for this bill from the Director of Congressional Budget Office (CBO).

Section 1 of the bill contains the short title, the ""Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act of 2020"".
Sec. 2. Findings. Section 2 of the bill makes a number of findings related to the significant domestic terrorism threat facing the United States, including that white supremacists and other far-right-wing extremists are the most significant domestic terrorism threat facing the country.
Sec. 3. Definitions.
Section 3 of the bill defines several terms, including ""domestic terrorism,"" which means ""activities that"" (1) ""involve acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State;"" (2) ""appear to be intended . . . to intimidate or coerce a civilian population . . . to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion . . . or to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping;"" and (3) ""occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States""; and excludes acts perpetrated by individuals associated with or inspired by foreign terrorist organizations.
Sec. 4. Offices to Combat Domestic Terrorism.
Section 4 of the bill authorizes, for ten years, domestic terrorism offices within the Office of Intelligence and Analysis of DHS, the Counterterrorism Section of the National Security Division of DOJ, and the Counterterrorism Division of the FBI.
Collectively, the offices are responsible for monitoring, analyzing, investigating, and prosecuting domestic terrorism.
The Secretary of Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and the FBI Director must each ensure that the authorized offices are adequately staffed to perform their required duties, including at least one staffer dedicated to ensuring compliance with civil rights and civil liberties laws and regulations. All staff must undergo annual anti-bias training.
This section also requires these offices to issue biannual reports to the House and Senate Judiciary, Homeland Security, and Intelligence Committees that assess the domestic terrorism threat posed by white supremacists and neo-Nazis (including white supremacist and neo-Nazi infiltration of Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies and the uniformed services); analyze domestic terrorism incidents that occurred in the previous six months; and provide transparency through a quantitative analysis of domestic terrorism-related assessments, investigations, incidents, arrests, indictments, prosecutions, convictions, and weapons recoveries, as well as an explanation of each individual case that progressed through more than one of those stages.
This section clarifies that all hate crime incidents must be reviewed to determine whether an incident also constitutes a domestic terrorism-related incident. The joint report must be unclassified to the greatest extent possible, with a classified annex only if necessary. The unclassified portion of the joint report must be made available to the public online. If any provision is duplicative of another reporting provision already in law, the agencies shall provide for the most extensive reporting analysis.
Additionally, this section codifies the Domestic Terrorism Executive Committee, which must meet at least four times per year to coordinate with United States Attorneys and other public safety officials to promote information sharing and ensure an effective, responsive, and organized joint effort to combat domestic terrorism.
Finally, this section requires the DHS, DOJ, and FBI domestic terrorism offices to focus their limited resources on the most significant domestic terrorism threats, as determined by the number of domestic-terrorism-related incidents included in the joint report.
Sec. 5. Training to Combat Domestic Terrorism.
Section 5 of the bill requires the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and the FBI Director to review the antiterrorism training and resource programs that are provided by their respective agencies to Federal, State, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies (including the State and Local AntiTerrorism Program, funded by DOJ's Bureau of Justice Assistance) and ensure that such programs include training and resources to assist law enforcement agencies in understanding, detecting, deterring, and investigating acts of domestic terrorism and white supremacist and neo-Nazi infiltration of law enforcement and corrections agencies.
The training must focus on the most significant domestic terrorism threats, as determined by the joint report, and individuals providing the training must have expertise in domestic terrorism and relevant academic, law enforcement, or other community-based experience. Additionally, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and the FBI Director must each submit a biannual report to the House and Senate Judiciary, Homeland Security, and Intelligence Committees on the training implemented by their respective agencies, including copies of all training materials used and the names and qualifications of the individuals who provide the training. The reports must be unclassified to the greatest extent possible, with a classified annex only if necessary. The unclassified portion of the reports must be made available to the public online.
Sec. 6. Interagency Task Force.
Section 6 of the bill directs, within 180 days, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and the FBI Director, along with the Secretary of Defense, to establish an interagency task force to combat white supremacist and neo-Nazi infiltration of the uniformed services and federal law enforcement. The task force must report on its findings and response to the House and Senate Judiciary, Homeland Security, Intelligence, and Armed Services Committees within a year of its establishment. The report must be unclassified to the greatest extent possible, with a classified annex only if necessary. The unclassified portion of the report must be made available to the public online.
Sec. 7. Department for Justice Support for Hate Crime Incidents with a Nexus to Domestic Terrorism.
Section 7 of the bill provides the DOJ's Community Relations Service the ability to offer support to communities where DOJ has brought charges in a hate crime incident that has a nexus to domestic terrorism and directs the FBI to assign a special agent or hate crimes liaison to each FBI field office to investigate hate crime incidents with a nexus to domestic terrorism.
Sec. 8. Authorization of Appropriations.
Section 8 of the bill authorizes such sums as necessary to be appropriated to DHS, DOJ, the FBI, and DoD to carry out these requirements.

Parolee voting rights will also be decided. Good morning, California. It's Thursday, June 25. Parolee voting also catapults to ballot"" >Esteban Nunez, a proponent of the parolee voting measure, seals his vote-by-mail envelope for the presidential primary on March 2. Photo by Anne Wernikoff for CalMatters In a massive shift from what seemed politically feasible just six months ago, California voters will decide in November whether to overturn the state's 1996 ban on affirmative action and once again permit the consideration of race and sex in public university admissions and state hiring and contracting. 
A supermajority of lawmakers voted Wednesday to propel the proposed constitutional amendment[1] to the November ballot, along with another that would grant California parolees the right to vote[2]. Both measures, top priorities for the Legislative Black Caucus[3], gained significant momentum amid widespread protests over racism following George Floyd's death at the hands of Minneapolis police. Political headwinds have shifted rapidly since January, when Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon told CalMatters[4] that 'from a political standpoint, it almost seems too late' to get the affirmative action measure on the ballot. Last week, University of California regents unanimously endorsed[5] reinstating affirmative action in their admissions practices, a striking departure from their 1995 ban on the policy — which led to a 10% drop in Black and 7% drop in Latino enrollment[6] the first year it was enforced. A number of Chinese American groups oppose reinstating affirmative action, arguing it would discriminate against Asian Americans, who are currently overrepresented[7] in both the CSU and UC systems. Voters will have the final say in November. Fifty-five percent voted to ban affirmative action[8] in 1996. ______________The coronavirus bottom line:As of 9 p.m. Wednesday night, California had190,222 confirmed coronavirus casesand5,632 deathsfrom the virus, according toaCalMatters tracker[9].

Newsom to cities, counties: Enforce mask order, or lose big bucks "" >Gov. Newsom speaks to reporters at Miss Ollie's restaurant in Oakland on June 9. Photo by Jeff Chiu, AP Photo/Pool Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday upped the ante for his statewide mask order[12], tying $2.5 billion in aid for local governments to their willingness to abide by state public health directives — though it remains unclear how cities and counties would prove their compliance. Newsom[13]: 'We give an enormous amount of power, control and authority to local government, but what we're now looking for is accountability.' The move came as California hit a record high[14] in the number of COVID-19 patients admitted to ICUs. Newsom added that coronavirus-related hospitalizations have ticked up by 29% over the past two weeks, a significant increase from the 16% figure he gave on Monday[15]. He continued to implore[16] Californians to wear face masks, a message echoed by Dr. Anthony Fauci[17], the nation's leading public health expert amid the pandemic, in a virtual event hosted Wednesday by the Sacramento Press Club. Fauci: 'This is an issue that really has social responsibility associated with it.' 2. California taking Uber, Lyft to court to force employee reclassification "" >A caravan of Uber and Lyft drivers passes by the Capitol during a rally in support of AB 5 on August 28, 2019. Photo by Anne Wernikoff for CalMatters California is taking Uber and Lyft to court — again — to force the companies to reclassify independent contractor drivers as employees within weeks, a move the ride-hail giants said could lead to a shutdown of services or a massive price hike, the San Francisco Chronicle reports[18]. The move comes a month after Attorney General Xavier Becerra and three city attorneys sued Uber and Lyft for failing to comply with AB 5, a new state law making it harder for companies to classify workers as independent contractors. This new legal action would force the companies to treat their workers as employees while the original lawsuit plays out. Voters will have their say in November. Last month, a measure championed by Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Instacart and Postmates that would allow drivers to remain classified as independent contractors qualified for the November ballot[19]. 3. University of California pivots to online fall term "" >Students wearing surgical masks walk through UC Berkeley's Sproul Plaza on March 12. Photo by Anne Wernikoff for CalMatters Fall classes will be held mostly online for University of California undergraduates, and students living on campus — two to a dorm room, at most — should expect to wear masks, practice social distancing and track their symptoms, CalMatters' Mikhail Zinshteyn reports[20]. It's a reality that departs somewhat from comments UC President Janet Napolitano made in May hoping that more classes would be held in person. UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol Christ: 'This is the most complex planning exercise we have ever done We simply don't know what is going to happen.' For more information on what campuses plan to do and student perspectives, check out Mikhail's report[21].4. Will California make racially motivated 911 calls hate crimes? "" >Illustration by Anne Wernikoff for CalMatters; elements via iStock Racially motivated 911 calls would be categorized as hate crimes under legislation that Assemblyman Rob Bonta, an Alameda Democrat, plans to introduce, CalMatters' Elizabeth Castillo reports[22]. The proposal comes on the heels of widespread protests over racism and a viral May incident in New York, in which a white woman called the police on a Black birdwatcher after he asked her to leash her dog. Though Bonta says the legislation 'would provide multiple pathways for justice of victims of racially weaponized 911 calls,' legal experts say it will be a challenge to prove that a person was targeted because of their race or another protected characteristic.

Although Armenians are generally spirited, our history is marked by oppression and loss. Armenia is one of the oldest nations in the world, at 3,500 years old; historic Armenia dates back to the 8th century BC.
Extermination is a recurring theme within Armenian history. The 1890s to early 1900s were marked with massacres eventually leading to the Armenian Genocide. On April 24th, 1915, the Ottoman Empire, planned a systematic killing and deportation of 1.5 million Armenians while the world turned a blind eye at the height of World War I. Turkish officials rounded up our people for execution. They sent our women, grandparents, and children into the desert on death marches. They burned our villages and churches. They drove our ancestors from our indigeneous lands, lands that exist today as present day Turkey. To this day the current Turkish government, led by Recip Tayip Erdogan, vehemently denies the Armenian genocide.
Artsakh is an is an ethnically Armenian autonomous region in the South Caucasuses, and is claimed by Azerbaijan, but has political, economic, and military support from Armenia and has been home to Armenians since ancient times, dating back to the 1st century BC. Armenians consider Artsakh to be Armenian because of its majority Armenian population (95%), and a shared, official common language (Armenian). Artsakh is run by an Armenian president and is home to many historic churches and monuments that are 2,000 years old.
After the Genocide in 1918, Armenia and Artsakh were forced to join the Soviet Union. In 1923, Joseph Stalin gave Artsakh to Azerbaijan to appease Turkey. During the fall of the Soviet Union, residents of Artsakh broke from Azerbaijan and voted to become an independent region, called the Republic of Artsakh. From 1988-1994, a war broke out in an ethnic and territorial conflict known as the Karabakh War. To Armenians, it is commonly referred to as the Artsakh Liberation War. The Armenians living in Artsakh demanded to unify with Armenia, and after the fall of the Soviet Union the tensions gradually grew into a violent conflict between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. Azerbaijanis expelled and murdered Armenians living in three different Soviet Socialist Republic cities, Sumgait, Baku, and Khojaly. It was a bloody and deadly war, but finally in 1994, a ceasefire agreement was signed and Artsakh began to operate as an independent state.
As of September 27th, 2020, Azerbaijan launched an unprovoked attack on Artsakh, violating the ceasefire. They continuously launch attacks by drone, bombing civilian settlements, including the capital of Artsakh. Azerbaijan is both politically and financially backed by Turkey, and Turkey assists Azerbaijan through military aid, paying mercenaries from Syria to fight on their behalf. This advances Turkey's goal of creating a Pan-Turkic state and their attempt at the ethnic-cleansing of the Armenian people. Each day, the attacks are becoming more and more serious and they are not subsiding. It has been a month since the first bombings began, and since then, they have not only been targeting our soldiers on the frontlines, but deliberately targeting and killing innocent civilian cities.
This shows that this is far more than a land dispute, but about the extermination of the Armenian people. Armenia has a small population of 3 million, compared to Azerbaijan's 10 million, and Turkey's 90 million. The agressors have repeatedly used banned cluster munitions in residential areas, bombing hospitals, targeting journalists, destroying churches, cultural centers and schools, torturing and beheading soldiers, executing prisoners of war, recruiting terrorists and using chemical warfare to set ablaze the forests.
Three ceasefire agreements were established between Armenia and Azerbaijan to allow time for each country to gather the bodies of their soldiers. Each agreement was violated by Azerbaijan in less than an hour with military strikes on civilian settlements in Artsakh. The international organization, Genocide Watch, declared that Azerbaijan is commiting stage 9 and 10 of genocide against the Armenian people in Artsakh. Stage 9 is defined as the elimination of the victim group and stage 10 as denial of the crime, yet the world still says silent and nothing is done.
Thousands of Armenians are displaced because of the war, forced to flee to Armenia. Those that stay are stuck in air raid shelters, uncertain if their loved ones are safe. Their sons, fathers, and grandfathers are fighting and for some, this is their second war. They have been fighting for the same rights for the past 42 years: the right to exist and peacefully live in their lands. The citizens of Armenia and Artsakh are willingly signing up to go to the frontlines, willing to sacrifice themselves for the Armenian cause.
Due to families having to gather in air raid shelters, COVID-19 is spreading through the population. Since the war started, the number of cases have exponentially grown. This is another concern for the Armenian people because they are having to fight two battles at once; a war and pandemic.
Even now, Armenians in the United States, France, Russia, and many other places are in danger. Armenians are are at risk of potentially being attacked and injured, whether at protests, walking down the street or in their cars. The Grey Wolves are an ultranationalist, far-right terrorist organization, whose ideology is rooted in the belief of Turkish superiority. They support Pan-Turanism, which is the movement to unify all Turkic peoples by means of eliminating all non-Turkic people from their lands. At some protests in the United States, Grey Wolves symbols have popped up in opposition to the peaceful protesting against injustice, genocide denial, war crimes, and hate crimes.
Over 1,200 Armenians have died since September 27th. An entire generation is being wiped out, since the majority of the soldiers are born in the late 90's and early 2000's. It has been over a month and yet remains unkown to many. The Armenian Diaspora around the world is doing whatever we can to amplify the voices on the frontline. The Armeniafund has raised over $150,000,000, and donations are used to provide humanitarian aid to the soldiers and to the families directly affected by the war. Armenian-diasporans all across the world have taken to the streets to protest, from New York to California, and in France, Argentina, Netherlands, London, Greece, Sweden, Canada and many other countries. One of the largest protests in California's history took place in Los Angeles last month, with 150,000 peaceful protestors. The lack of major news coverage spurred Armenians in New York and Philadelphia to shut down major highways by blocking traffic, to gain media recognition. All over Europe, Armenians shut down the borders into other countries, blocking the entrances by protesting on the highways with Armenian flags. The Armenian Diaspora is united like no other. We are determined to get the justice we deserve and for our voices to be heard. We are determined that we will win this war.
We have been screaming for the recognition of the Armenian genocide for 105 years. For 105 years, we attended marches and protests chanting ""1915, never again."" For 105 years, our wounds have remained open and now they are bleeding more than ever. For 105 years, we pleaded to the world for recognition so history would not repeat itself. For 105 years, the world was silent as the Armenian people were deliberately killed. We protest to call on politicians to recognize the Republic of Artsakh and to sanction the authoritative dictators that are Erdogan, President of Turkey and Aliyev, President of Azerbaijan.
It is evident why we Armenians are so passionate about our culture. If the world continues to stay silent, there will be no more Armenia and no more Armenian people. It is vital for every non-Armenian to hear our cries, to affirm our struggles and to bear witness to the destruction of a people and wiping out of an entire generation of Armenians. Until Armenians can live peacefully, we will not stay silent.
There are many ways to take action to support Armenians right now. Text 'Sanctions' to 44144, 'Artsakh' to 52886, 'Genoicde' to 52886. Send letters to your representatives, become an Armenian National Committee of America rapid responder at anca.org. Donate to the Armeniafund at armeniafund.ejoinme.org/donate. Advocate for the Armenian cause by posting on social media. Any awareness and support we can get from non-Armenians is greatly appreciated."

As Trump continues to ignore the deadly coronavirus, a massive national crisis that has killed more than 130,000 Americans and has no end in sight, his behavior in recent days has been marked by calls to preserve statues of Confederate generals who took up arms against the United States and defending their memory, even threatening to veto a must-pass defense spending bill to do so. It's all in character for a politician whose career began with a racist conspiracy against former President Barack Obama and who ran his 2016 campaign as a counter-cultural reaction to the country's first Black president. Trump has also retreated to racial equivocation when his turbulent presidency before ran into trouble.
Were the rest of his term not such a riot of outrage and impropriety and had he not spent his life exploiting racial fault lines for personal gain, Trump's solidifying reelection strategy -- rooted in unhealed wounds of the Civil War that ended 155 years ago -- would be more of a shock.
And while it's rooted in his character and ideological core, his campaign tone is also a Hail Mary.
Trump was stripped of the motoring economy on which he had planned to anchor his claims of a return to American greatness by a pandemic that could have showcased the ""I Alone Can Fix It"" leadership skills of which he boasted four years ago. Instead the crisis exposed his governing method based on chaos, building alternative political realities, ignoring science and lying repeatedly about easily provable facts.
By condemning efforts to pull down the Confederate flag, by portraying a nation locked in a dark feudal struggle against rampant crime, unrest and ""far left fascism,"" Trump is not just running the most demagogic, polarizing and race-baiting campaign in modern American history. He is betting that the uncanny political insight that powered his 2016 campaign will triumph again over an industry of political consultants, antsy Republican lawmakers and media pundits who see his crushed approval ratings and polls showing him trailing in battleground states as the throes of a doomed campaign.
If that damages the fabric of America, so be it.
Trump cuts against the grain
Trump's high-risk approach flies in the face of normally cautious institutions averse to racial reckonings that have made their own decision to change course after in some cases concluding continued resistance to change is bad for business and their brands.
NASCAR, the racing circuit popular in the conservative South, has banned the Confederate flag and stood behind one of its few Black drivers -- provoking a searing Trump Twitter attack on Monday. The Mississippi Legislature has passed a bill to cut the stars and bars from its state flag. And the Washington Redskins, which have for years disputed that their famous emblem is racist, are brainstorming for a new name -- a sign of the tsunami of change sent through the NFL after Colin Kaepernick took a knee to protest police brutality.
But against this sudden and sharp cultural sea change, Trump, as he has so often in a gambler's career in real estate and entertainment, is making the counter-intuitive wager.
He is pinning his hopes for another four years on the idea that his silent majority of voters in rural areas of swing states such as Michigan and Wisconsin, as well as suburban swing voters, will respond to his warnings. Trump claims that tumbling statues -- not just of Confederate leaders -- but of more mainstream historical figures with now discredited racial attitudes mean (White) American culture and history is under attack.
It is a strategy that exhumes some of the nation's most sensitive political arguments, is sure to leave the last semblances of unity shattered for whoever is the next President and could reverberate through national politics for years to come.
Exclusionary patriotism
Trump's hardening election strategy was clearly spelled out by the way he used the July Fourth Independence Day weekend -- previously one of the few nonpartisan moments in America -- as a long running version of the campaign rallies that have been hampered by the coronavirus.
In a fear-laden speech at Mount Rushmore, Trump portrayed multi-racial protesters who took to the street following the killing of George Floyd as an outburst of radical, Marxist anarchy from those who want to ""end America."" In blasting a new ""far left fascism that demands absolute allegiance,"" he warned that those that did not speak its language were liable to be ""banished, blacklisted, persecuted and punished.""
In effect, Trump's line was a supercharging of the campaign against what he said was political correctness that helped to underpin his 2016 presidential campaign. But his dark, hyperbolic tone strengthened the impression of an authoritarian, ultra-nationalist spirit that is a strong component of his own politics.
Trump's speeches in South Dakota and at the White House before the national fireworks display were artful in their way: they contained many references to the Founders, to basic American values and to Abraham Lincoln, as a foundation on which Trump built his argument that American history was under attack. This allowed prominent conservative media voices like the Wall Street Journal editorial page and the National Review to disregard how the inflammatory passage might appear to non-Trump supporters and to praise his weekend offerings as a brace of his greatest speeches.
""The chorus of independent media voices understands that Mr. Trump is trying to rally the country in defense of traditional American principles that are now under radical and unprecedented assault,"" the Journal wrote in an editorial.
Fox News then took the opportunity to brand coverage of Trump's more explosive remarks as an example of media bias -- completing the familiar cycle of Trump's base-pleasing antics.
But Trump practices an exclusionary patriotism. The impression left by his two speeches is that any American who disagrees with his perception of history or who thinks that the historical consequences of slavery and their legacy in a modern society need a sober reexamination is not a proper American at all. While there has been tragedy and sporadic unrest on American streets -- six children were killed in gun violence this weekend and there were 44 shootings in New York City while multiple statues have been pulled down, Trump's apocalyptic vision of life in America is not a widely recognizable one.
Another day of racial controversy
Trump might have been wiser to bask in strong reviews from conservative media. But the President can't leave well enough alone and often quickly puts those who defend him in an invidious spot. Soon, he was demanding an apology from Black NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace after a drama in which racing officials said a noose was found in his team garage. The FBI later concluded that the incident was not a hate crime directed at Wallace.
But Trump accused Wallace of perpetrating a hoax and said the stock car series was suffering its lowest ratings ever for banning its supporters from bringing Confederate flags to raceways.
Thus, Wallace, already in an uncomfortable and vulnerable position -- despite strong and moving support from his fellow drivers -- found himself dragged as an unwilling victim into Trump's race-based political campaigning. The NASCAR driver later implored his Twitter followers to ""always deal with the hate being thrown at you with LOVE! Love over hate every day. Love should come naturally as people are TAUGHT to hate.""
He added, ""Even when it's HATE from the POTUS.""
Hours later, the President inflamed yet another racial controversy. He lashed out at the Washington Redskins organization and Major League Baseball's Cleveland Indians for mulling a name change after years of controversy.
He claimed that the teams were so named to recognize ""STRENGTH, not weakness"" and added in an ugly racist swipe at the end of the tweet: ""Indians, like Elizabeth Warren, must be very angry right now!""
Then, in a daily press briefing, McEnany refused to denounce the Confederate flag and insisted that Trump ""has not given an opinion one way or the other"" on the NASCAR ban.
It was just another day on which the President seemed to go out of his way to deliberately court racial controversy.
And given his depressed approval rating -- in territory that history suggests will be difficult for him to win reelection -- and vulnerable position in swing states he only won by tiny margins over Hillary Clinton four years ago, he appears to be taking a big risk with his hard swing to the right and culture warrior approach.
But only four months from election day, he is betting that he knows the motivations of his base, less affiliated Republican and swing voters and the character of America better than anyone else.

42,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1251/Files (250).DOCX","Newsweek.com",2020-07-21,"877 words",NA,"Paul Miller",NA,"Woke Racism: 'Jewish Privilege'",FALSE,"On a recent Sunday afternoon, #JewishPrivilege was trending on Twitter. What does this even mean?
To be a Jew in America apparently means you are privileged to be the most targeted ethnic and religious group in the country, according to the FBI. Jewish students on college campuses have had the privilege of being victimized in more than 175 incidents of anti-Semitism so far this year, notes the anti-Semitism watchdog group AMCHA Initiative. Is it a privilege that in 2019, over half the hate crimes in New York City were committed against Jews? Maybe it's growing up hearing stories about your relatives murdered by the Nazis, or during the pogroms that ravaged the Jews of Eastern Europe. Anti-Semitism is a ""privilege"" only in Orwellian doublespeak.
This latest form of Jew-hatred began just a few years ago. I recall flyers posted on the campus of the University of Illinois at Chicago in the spring of 2017 that read, ""ENDING WHITE PRIVILEGE STARTS WITH ENDING JEWISH PRIVILEGE."" The flyers depicted Jews at the peak of a pyramid of wealth, claiming that 44 percent of Jews were in the top one percent. The horror in this story is not the falsehood of the statistics, but that the goal of the flyers was to elicit hatred toward Jews.
The flyers reflected a disdain for Jews shared by anti-Israel organizations on campus and their leftist allies who preach ""intersectionality,"" proffered as a common bond of all putatively oppressed groups. This ideology links Muslim groups with radical feminists and progressive organizations whose goals might have nothing in common other than an abhorrence of Israel and Jews who don't fall in line with their far-left ideology.
If there is any silver lining in the anti-Jewish trend that is the ""Jewish Privilege"" Twitter hashtag, it's that Jews from across the political spectrum took to social media and fought back. Jews reclaimed the hashtag by sharing their encounters as Jews, and the anti-Semitism they have experienced.
But the fact that in 2020, Jews had to take to modern media platforms to combat Jew-hatred, is disturbing. ""#JewishPrivilege"" was used by so many to express hatred for the Jewish people that it was publicized by Twitter as a trending hashtag.
#JewishPrivilege is the voice of the woke racist—the college-age, hip bigots who protest against police and vandalize statues of historical figures. Practitioners of intersectionality, they have bought into the age-old blame-the-Jews mentality. White privilege is bad, and Jewish privilege is even worse.
But this new hatred is only the tip of the iceberg. Jewish privilege ""means always having to say you're sorry""—sorry for all the sins immortalized in centuries-old canards that continue to flourish in America and around the world.
Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan used his annual Criterion Speech to blame Jews for the ills of the world, preaching hate-filled lies about Jewish control and power to over a million people on YouTube. One wonders how many new woke bigots were born out of his fire and brimstone about ""Satan""—Farrakhan's trademark reference to Jews.
While Farrakhan was spewing his hate, DeSean Jackson of the NFL's Philadelphia Eagles shared a vile anti-Semitic quote falsely attributed to Hitler.
Right before the Farrakhan and Jackson tirades, Nick Cannon, host of the Fox show ""The Masked Singer,"" sat down with longtime anti-Semite, rapper Richard Griffin, for an anti-Semitic gabfest. After outrage by the Jewish community and a few media outlets, Cannon reluctantly apologized. But the damage was done. How many young people absorbed the hate and ignored the apology?
#JewishPrivilege is not the only new weapon of anti-Semitism. Blaming Jews for global tragedies has resurfaced anew in the age of COVID-19.
According to researchers at the Kantor Center at Tel Aviv University, the pandemic has ""unleashed a unique worldwide wave of anti-Semitism [that] includes a range of libels that have one common element: The Jews, the Zionists and/or the state of Israel are to blame for the pandemic and/or stand to gain from it.""
A study conducted in May by Oxford University found that over 19 percent of the British public believe that Jews are responsible for the pandemic. No privilege in one-fifth of the population blaming you for a deadly virus.
Jews are in a lose-lose situation. Israel is a worldwide leader in the race to treat and cure COVID-19. Yet every anti-Israel government, from the Palestinian Authority to the Iranian regime, blames the Jewish state for the virus' spread. Iran even claims Israel created an extra deadly strain just for the Iranian people.
It's disturbing enough that millions, if not more, blame Jews for the virus. If the Israelis cure COVID-19, the anti-Semites will have a field day. The old libel of Zionist control and profit will dominate news headlines, be embraced by radical leftists and far-right groups and have its own hashtag on Twitter.
The concept of a privileged class—whether white privilege, Jewish privilege or Black privilege—must be called out for what it is: racism.

Slowly but surely, attention is turning to what's known as 'alt tech' — i.e., independent social platforms and services, especially as they are becoming the new home for those who have been unable to have their voices heard or even participate, as they are in recent years getting deplatformed and banned in droves by Twitter, Google, and Facebook. One such alt tech network that is gaining traction is Parler and this is where some conservatives are now going when they decide to leave Twitter and Facebook.[52] Carjackings Spiking Across Large Swaths of Chicago[53] CHICAGO (CBS) — Large parts of the city have found themselves under attack. Police on Tuesday night were asking the public to pay special attention if they live or work around where a string of carjackings and robberies are going down. As CBS2's Charlie De Mar reported, the Lincoln Park neighborhood is among the affected areas. There has been a large cluster of armed robberies and carjacking incidents in the neighborhood— two of them right on streets that go through Oz Park. West Dickens Avenue runs right to the lion statue at Oz Park. It is also where a coward saw an opportunity to rob someone and steal a car last month. The same thing happened a few minutes later on Burling Street. In fact, Chicago Police warned of 12 armed carjackings starting in mid-October up until last week — with a large cluster in Lincoln Park and Lakeview on the North Side.[54] Exclusive Video: Millions of Trump Supports Rally in D.C. To Support the President[55] The Million MAGA March that has been advertised on social media for the past week has shattered even the loftiest expectations for turnout Saturday, as massive throngs of patriotic American citizens descended on Washington, D.C. Saturday to protest against unfair elections and on behalf of President Donald Trump. National File staff on the ground at the march have obtained exclusive photographs and video footage showcasing the unprecedented turnout, which has remained almost entirely peaceful despite dwarfing the numbers pulled in by the summer's violent Black Lives Matter 'protests.'[56] Fatal Shooting in St. Paul Brings City's Homicide Tally to 30[57] A verbal argument led to gunfire near Sherburne Avenue and Rice Street late Saturday. One person was fatally shot Saturday night near the Minnesota State Capitol in St. Paul, police said in a late-night tweet. The shooting occurred near the intersection of Rice Street and Sherburne Avenue, just northwest of the Capitol, around 9 p.m., police said. Emergency dispatch audio described the victim as a 34-year-old man who suffered two gunshot wounds — one to the abdomen and one to the chest. The victim and a suspect had argued before the shooting, according to police scanner audio[58] Joe Biden Promises to Raise Annual U.S. Refugee Target by 800%[59] Joe Biden told the Jesuit Refugee Service this week that he plans to drastically increase the annual number of refugees taken in by the United States by over 800 percent of current figures.

But now, after the post-election censorship where legal challenges about potential voter fraud or election malpractice are taking place, instead of waiting for a judge to rule, Big Tech platforms are censoring complaints of voter fraud.[64] More 2020 D.C. Homicides Than in All of Last Year[65] With two fatal shootings in the opening days of November, more people have been killed in Washington, D.C., this year than in all of 2019, reports the Washington Post. The shootings Monday and Tuesday brought the city's homicide count to 167, according to D.C. police, one over last year's total count. The city last surpassed this number of killings in 2008. The two victims this week were found a mile from each other, but police do not think the two shootings are related. While many types of crime have slowed during the pandemic, D.C. has seen a rise in homicides and shootings. Police have attributed much of the violence to disputes involving neighborhood crews and gangs or between people who know one another. Police Chief Peter Newsham has blamed the spike in homicides on a proliferation of illegal firearms. He argues that many of those arrested are being treated too leniently by the criminal justice system and commit new offenses when they return to the community.[66] Nancy Pelosi Says Facebook is 'Part of the Problem' For Allowing People to Claim Election Fraud[67] US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has confessed to not being a big fan of Facebook, and touched on this in comments she made on Friday. Pelosi's way of articulating her dislike of the company, however, is quite interesting, even for a politician: 'I don't know what they have been doing, but I know they've been part of the problem all along.' This prominent Democrat managed to confess to both being ignorant of what's going on in one of the world's most influential and powerful entities — Facebook — and also, that not knowing the facts doesn't stop her from 'knowing' that somebody else is in the wrong.[68] Nationwide, Non-Partisan 'Verify the Election' Petition Demands Full Audit of 2020 Election Results[69] A nationwide, non-partisan petition is going viral online, demanding a full and fair audit of the 2020 Presidential Election amidst allegations of massive Democrat voter fraud schemes. The petition, backed by the Salem Radio Network, can be found at VerifyTheElection.com alongside a long list of demands. 'We demand a fair election,' the petition's headline reads. 'Count every legal 2020 vote.'[70] NYPD Can No Longer Force Muslim Women to Remove Hijabs in Mug Shots, Settlement Says[71] NEW YORK — The New York Police Department will no longer require people who are arrested to remove religious headwear during mug shots as part of a settlement in a federal lawsuit. A group of Muslim women sued New York City after they said they were forced to remove their hijabs after arrests and be photographed with their head and hair uncovered.[72] Officials Investigating Alleged Arson Targeting an Oregon Law Enforcement Officer[73] Federal law enforcement agencies are investigating a fire in Washington County that took place outside a law enforcement officer's home Wednesday. The fire was arson and burned a vehicle, according to a spokesman for the Washington County Sheriff's Office. Law enforcement said they are still investigating, but believe the incident may be linked to recent protests in Portland and could be a form of intimidation.[74] Pelosi Cancels in-Person Dinner for New Dems After Photo Sparks Backlash[75] Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced the cancellation of an in-person dinner that was planned for new Democratic members of Congress on Saturday.

Rally[77] A group of leftist protesters attacked numerous Trump supporters who had finished taking part in a rally on the streets of Washington, DC, on Saturday. In one of the most graphic attacks, a man who tried to fight off an attack is hit from behind while at least two women kick and stomp his head. Several videos captured numerous attacks by protesters that were chasing Trump supporters out of the rally area as the group made their way to their vehicles. Earlier in the day, thousands of Trump supporters had gathered in D.C. for a rally supporting U.S. President Donald J. Trump. Violence broke out as the rally ended and people attempted to leave.[78] Video: Antifa Cowers Behind Police Protection at Million MAGA March[79] An overwhelming presence of presence of patriotic American citizens descended on Washington, D.C. Saturday for the Million MAGA March against voter fraud, and as promised antifa black bloc and Black Lives Matter showed up to counter-protest. Curiously, however, while Antifa and BLM are known for their anti-police rhetoric, their members largely opted to hide behind lines of uniformed riot police while waving signs emblazoned with empty, violent threats. Video footage from the march shows a contingent of black bloc Antifa cowering behind the police while holding up banners with violent calls to 'Punch MAGA in the face,' as well as 'Biden/Harris 2020' campaign signs. Trump supporters can be heard repeatedly calling the antifa members 'p**sies' in the footage.[80] Watch: Fauci Says to Americans, 'Now is the Time to Do What You're Told'[81] Dr. Anthony Fauci said 'now is the time [for Americans] to do what [they are] told' on Thursday while speaking with other health officials at the Washington National Cathedral.[82] YouTube Removes Alex Jones Tim Pool Podcast for 'Harassment and Bullying'[83] On Thursday, Infowars host and founder Alex Jones appeared on journalist Tim Pool's Timcast IRL podcast alongside author and media personality Michael Malice. As with most of Jones' guest appearances, the episode was hugely popular and racked up 999,000 views in less than 24 hours. It also had a 99% approval rating with 92,000 likes to 1,300 dislikes. But less than a day after the episode was live streamed, YouTube took it down and claimed that it violated the rules around 'harassment and bullying.'[84] Dominion Voting Systems Shares Floor Space With Soros Group, Partnered With Soros Friend[85] Dominion Voting Systems shares an office floor with the George Soros-funded left-wing Tides Foundation in Toronto, NATIONAL FILE has learned. Our tipster makes clear that 'Soros people' are very close with Dominion, which has partnered with a voting technology company chaired by one of left-wing billionaire George Soros' best friends and associates. Dominion was caught flipping votes from President Donald Trump to Joe Biden in the 2020 election, and Trump has cited data to accuse Dominion of widespread vote-flipping and vote-losing in key states. Dominion is headquartered in Toronto and has a U.S. office in Denver.[86] Austria: Islamists Threaten to Murder Interior Minister and His Family After Crackdown on Political Islam[87] Radical Islamic extremists have threatened to murder Austrian Interior Minister Karl Nehammer and his family following a crackdown on political Islam which, so far, have seen multiple mosques closed and raids carried out against radical Islamist groups. Due to the death threats, the interior minister, his wife, and two children have all been placed under 24-hour police protection and are being guarded by EKO Cobra, an elite anti-terrorism tactical unit, Nehammer told the Austrian newspaper Kronen Zeitung. While admitting that he had received many death threats in the past, Nehammer said that threats against his family were something entirely new. Nehammer added that neither he nor his family would be intimidated by such threats.[88] Austria: Security Forces Arrest 30 Radical Islamists as Chancellor Kurz Declares Ban on Political Islam[89] On Monday morning, just two days before Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz announced plans to enact new laws that would allow for the criminal prosecution of those who propagate political Islamic ideologies, security forces arrested 30 suspected Islamists in a series of predawn raids which saw more than 60 residences searched. The raids, named Operation Luxor, followed last week's deadly terror attack which saw a convicted Islamic State supporter gun down four people in the Vienna's city center, and targeted the Muslim Brotherhood, Austrian branches of the Palestinian militant organization Hamas, and other international groups which openly advocate for Sharia law in Austria. Those arrested during the sweeps, which took place across the states of Vienna, Styria, Carinthia, and Lower Austria, are alleged to have been involved in money laundering activities, the financing of terrorism, and the formation of a terrorist association, the Daily Mail reports.[90] Austria's New Hate Speech Law[91] The Austrian government has presented a draft online hate speech law, the Communication Platforms Act, which, if passed, will limit free speech in the country. The Austrian government writes in the introduction to its proposed law: 'The main reason for the development of this draft Act is the worrying development that the Internet and social media, in addition to the advantages that these new technologies and communication channels provide, have also established a new form of violence, and hate on the Internet is increasing in the form of insults, humiliation, false information and even threats of violence and death. The attacks are predominantly based on racist, xenophobic, misogynistic and homophobic motives. A comprehensive strategy and a set of measures are required that range from prevention to sanctions. This strategy is based on the two pillars of platform responsibility and victim protection, with the present draft Act relating to ensuring platform responsibility'.[92] France: Socialist 'Anti-Hate' Chief Resigns From Paris Govt Over Rape Indictment[93] Pierre Aidenbaum, former deputy of Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo and former president of a French anti-hate group, has resigned his post in government after being indicted for rape. Aidenbaum, a socialist who served as president of the International League Against Racism and Anti-Semitism (Licra), was indicted for rape and sexual assault on October 9th and stands accused of raping a 40-year-old colleague he had worked with for years.[94] France: Danish Anti-Islam Activist Deported After Trying to Burn Islamic Qur'an[95] Danish anti-Islam activist Rasmus Paludan was arrested in Paris this week and deported after trying to burn the Qur'an in front of the Arc de Triomphe. Paludan was arrested in his car at around 2:30 p.m. on Wednesday, the same day France commemorates the end of the First World War and pays homage to fallen soldiers.[96] France: Police Arrest Man Armed With Knife Who Plotted to Kill Nice Terrorist[97] A man armed with a knife was arrested at a hospital in the Paris region after allegedly looking for the Nice terror attacker to kill him. Hospital security stopped the man on Wednesday, finding a knife in his pocket. The suspect admitted he was looking for the 21-year-old Tunisian migrant, Brahim Aouissaoui, who killed three people in a Nice church last month, saying he wanted to 'deliver justice' and kill him. The man, who has not been identified, was later taken into police custody, with investigators saying they are still investigating his motives, La Depeche reports. [Comment: I think that's 'Nice' as in the city.][98] Heads Are Rolling in Slovakia's Anti-Corruption Drive as Judges, Officials and Police End Up in Handcuffs[99] Top-ranking officials have been removed from office or arrested in Slovakian Prime Minister Igor Matovic's anti-corruption drive in the small Central-Eastern European country. Prime Minister Matovic, who came to office in February this year on an anti-corruption and organized crime platform, is widely credited with the downfall of previously untouchable and all-powerful officials, police chiefs and politicians. The latest person to be stripped of his position and arrested is the former head of the Office of Special Prosecutions Dusan Kovacik, who is accused of malfeasance in office, corruption, taking bribes and assisting a criminal organization. He has been taken into custody by officers from the Slovakian National Criminal Agency (NAKA). The irony is that all these types of serious offenses, such as organized crime and corruption, fell under the very jurisdiction of the office headed by Kovacik.[100] Metal Detectors Installed at British Railway Stations to Tackle Knife Crime[101] Police forces have installed 'knife arches' at railway stations in England and Wales to tackle violent knife crime. London's Metropolitan Police in partnership with the British Transport Police (BTP), Thames Valley Police, Merseyside Police, and Leicestershire Police are some of the forces involved in Operation Sceptre, which takes place twice a year.[102] Rescued Migrants Transferred to Quarantine Ship[103] More than 200 migrants rescued by Open Arms, a Spanish NGO, were transferred from a charity vessel to another boat for mandatory quarantine on Saturday (November 14). The 253 migrants, including women and children, were moved to a ferry off the Sicilian port of Trapani. They were rescued by Open Arms after their dinghy began to sink off the coast of Libya on Wednesday (November 11).[104] Scottish Hate Crime Bill Could Criminalise 'Inflammatory' Bible[105] A sloppily worded hate crime bill in Scotland could undermine free speech and unfairly stigmatize people of faith, the Christian Institute has warned. The Christian Institute's Deputy Director Ciaran Kelly said on Friday that the proposed legislation 'risks creating a chilling effect on free speech' because of the ambiguity of its language and lack of protections for basic freedoms.[106] Top UK Politician: Workplaces, Social Venues, May Ban Britons Without Vaccination Certificates[107] A senior Conservative MP has said it is possible that once mass vaccination is underway workplaces and social venues may ban entry to those who do not have a certificate to prove they have been vaccinated against COVID-19. Earlier this week, drugs firms Pfizer and BioNTech revealed that their coronavirus vaccine was more than 90 per cent effective at preventing infection. However, the British government was cautious about the development, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson telling a press conference: 'I must stress that these are very, very early days.'[108] UK: Law Commission Pushes for Hate Speech Law to Ban 'Islamophobic' Mohammed Cartoons[109] The Law Commission has proposed changes to hate crime laws in Britain that would see Charlie Hebdo style caricatures of the Islamic prophet banned, in what is being described as 'the Scottish Hate Crime Bill on steroids'. The suggested hate speech reforms from the Law Commission, an unelected official body of lawyers in England and Wales, would see the government ban the dissemination of 'inflammatory cartoons' in the wake of Islamist terror attacks in France.[110] Al Qaeda's Second-Highest Leader Killed in Iran[111] Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah, 58, who was believed to be Al Qaeda's second-highest leader, was shot and killed by two assassins on August 7 in Iran, intelligence officials confirmed. No country has publicly claimed responsibility for killing Abdullah. Al Qaeda has yet to announce Abdullah's death. Officials say Israeli operatives carried out the attack. It is unclear what role the U.S. played in Abdullah's killing.[112] ISIS Claims Attack at Saudi WWI Ceremony[113] BEIRUT — The Islamic State group claimed responsibility on Thursday for the explosion the previous day at a cemetery in Saudi Arabia, saying it primarily targeted French diplomats attending the ceremony in remembrance of the end of World War I. Other Europeans and Americans were attending the ceremony at the Non-Muslims Cemetery in the kingdom's coastal city of Jiddah. The blast wounded three people, leaving them with light to minor injuries.[114] Exodus: Christian Armenians Burn Their Homes as Land Handed to Turkey-Backed Azeris[115] KALBAJAR, Azerbaijan (AP) — In a bitter farewell to his home of 21 years, Garo Dadevusyan wrenched off its metal roof and prepared to set the stone house on fire. Thick smoke poured from houses that his neighbours had already torched before fleeing this ethnic Armenian village about to come under Azerbaijani control. The village is to be turned over to Azerbaijan on Sunday as part of territorial concessions in an agreement to end six weeks of intense fighting with Armenian forces. The move gripped its 600 people with fear and anger so deep that they destroyed the homes they once loved.[116] Turkish Al-Qaeda Group Operating Out of Azerbaijan Led by IHH Charity Founder[117] A Turkish al-Qaeda cell operating in Azerbaijan was led by the head of a Turkish-Azeri business association and founder of controversial charity group the Foundation for Human Rights and Freedoms and Humanitarian Relief (IHH), which has links to Turkish intelligence agency MIT, a Nordic Monitor investigation has found. According to a review of court documents, Hüseyin Büyükfirat, former IHH representative for the Caucasus, had run the operations of the IHH under the pretense of charitable work while keeping in contact with a Turkish al-Qaeda group called Tahsiyeciler. Turkish law enforcement kept tabs on Büyükfirat and was wiretapping his phone when he spoke to indicted al-Qaeda group leader Mullah Muhammed (real name: Mehmet Dogan) about plans and funds transfers.[118] Punjab: Christian Mother and Son, Killed by Muslim Neighbours in Quarrel[119] The woman and her 25-year-old son were killed in front of their home. Nobody in the village helped them. For human rights activists, the fact is 'a huge example of intolerance and hatred that spreads against Christians', also nourished in schools. Central and state government's silence and failure to defend minorities. Gujranwala (AsiaNews) — On November 9, Yasmeen and her only son, Usman Masih, 25 (photo 2), were shot dead by two of their Muslim neighbours, Hassan Butt (photo 3) and Khizer Butt. At first, some media reported that the killing was due to a case of blasphemy, but later it emerged that the reason was more trivial: a heated discussion between two women, Yasmeen and the mother of the two killers, Ishrat Bibi (photo 4).[120] 'You Backed Hong Kong!' China Finally Admits Why it Introduced Extraordinary Bans on Australian Exports Including Wine, Timber and Seafood[121] Wang Wenbin, a spokesman from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has told Australia to butt out of commenting on Hong Kong or Muslim Uighers after timber exports were suspended.[122] Is the Great Australian Rort Over?

Tishko S., 23, has challenged the 18-year-sentence handed down to him by a Swedish court after he was convicted in July of killing 17-year-old Andersson. Initially, he had been sentenced to life, but a court reduced his term to just 18 years.[130] Italy: Three Suspected Jihadists Escape Deportation Center, One is Still on the Run[131] Yet another consequence of the laxity in Europe regarding illegal Muslim migration, along with the persistent denial about jihad threats to Western nations. Last year, 'an illegal Tunisian migrant, who had been deported from Italy, mocked populist leader Matteo Salvini after getting back into the country, saying he was glad Salvini was gone.' Under Italy's left-leaning coalition government, illegal migrants have been flooding into the country via its open ports; meanwhile, Italian citizens are in strict coronavirus lockdown. In August alone, 11,000 migrants swarmed in. Merely twenty-four hours after the recent jihad massacre in the Notre-Dame basilica in Nice, France — by an illegal Muslim migrant who entered through Italy — dozens of Muslims outside of Sant'Andrea della Valle shouted 'Allahu akbar' and denounced insults to their religion. They also demanded that France apologize. How many of these people had just entered Europe? How likely are they to integrate into European society? 'Three immigrants flee the CPR. It is alarming: 'They are suspected terrorists,'' translated from 'Tre immigrati fuggono dal Cpr. allarme: 'Sono sospetti terroristi,'' by Federico Garau, Il Giornale, November 11, 2020.[132] Syrian Man Who Circumcised Boys With Soldering Gun Walks With Suspended Sentence in Sweden[133] A Syrian man who between April and May 2018 circumcised nine boys with a soldering gun in the Swedish cities of Söderhamn and Gvle has been slapped with a suspended sentence, national broadcaster SVT reported. The man is in his 30s and is not a licensed doctor in Sweden. He performed the circumcisions at the request of the boys' guardians with a non-medical soldering gun. For his services, he received approximately SEK 2,000 ($230) in payment. Medical journals describe how the underage victims of the botched circumcision were in so much pain that they had difficulty walking.[134] Oxford Dictionary Changes Definitions for 'Man' And 'Woman'[135] The publishers of the Oxford English Dictionary changed definitions for various words, including 'man' and 'woman.' The OED previously included 'a man's wife, girlfriend, or lover' in its definition for 'woman.' It now reads 'a person's wife, girlfriend, or lover.' The same was done to the definition for 'man,' which now reads 'a person's husband, boyfriend, or lover.'[136] Target Silently Removes Then Reinstates Dr. Debra Soh's Book, The End of Gender[137] Target is under fire again for removing another book on gender identity. The retailer has re-listed the book after being accused of censorship and thought-policing.

Soh wrote on Twitter in a post with screenshots showing that her book was no longer available.[138] [ 1]: #428783 [ 2]: #428795 [ 3]: #428759 [ 4]: #428765 [ 5]: #428791 [ 6]: #428821 [ 7]: #428813 [

During the past century, we have witnessed a long and tragic history of domestic policies that have targeted persons of Arab descent. We have been subjected to discriminatory treatment by law enforcement, immigration authorities, and by both Democratic and Republican Administrations. In addition to these hurtful policies, it is important to note the role played by the scapegoating of Arabs in American politics.In the 'The Politics of Exclusion', published in 1990 by the Arab American Institute, we have documented painful experiences of Arab American candidates who were targeted by their opponents for their Arab ancestry or the instances in which candidates for local and federal posts baited their opponents for accepting contributions from Arab Americans or for having an individual of Arab descent on staff. As a result, some candidates became afraid of accepting the support of Arab Americans.Examples abound. 
In 1983, a Democrat running for Mayor in Philadelphia was challenged by his Republican opponent for accepting contributions from Arab Americans. He responded by returning the donations. In 1984, Walter Mondale running for president returned money to Arab American donors and in 1988, Michael Dukakis' presidential campaign rejected an Arab American endorsement. In the years that followed, a Republican Congressman running for Senate asked Arab American leaders not to contribute to his campaign as did a Democrat running for Mayor in New York City.All of these acts of discrimination were motivated by fear of alienating Jewish voters and were prompted by a campaign launched by a number of major American Jewish organisations, including the Anti-Defamation League, the American Jewish Committee, and AIPAC, who published 'blacklists' warning of the emergence of Arab American leaders and groups who were deemed 'anti-Israel' and were therefore to be shunned.During the next two decades, especially following the signing of the Oslo Accords, this exclusion somewhat subsided, only to make a disturbing comeback during the 2008 presidential campaign. It resurfaced as an exclusively Republican-led effort and morphed into a largely anti-Muslim phenomenon.Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin stoked anti-Arab and anti-Muslim fires in framing her opposition to the Democratic nominee Barack Obama. This effort of focusing on Obama's 'otherness' resulted in the encounter Senator John McCain, the GOP's nominee, had at a town hall. When accosted by a questioner who insisted that Obama was an Arab, McCain famously responded 'No he's not, he's a decent family man.' While heralded by some in the media as a sign of McCain's nobility, Arab Americans, many of whom were 'decent family men,' were less than impressed.In 2010, we witnessed distinct Muslim-baiting used in a national campaign for the first time. It was utilised by former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich who latched onto a local New York City controversy involving plans to build an Islamic Community Centre a short distance from Ground Zero.Using the language of anti-Muslim bigots, Gingrich said that Muslims were intending to construct a 'Victory Mosque' to mark their conquering America. In that year's Congressional elections, 17 Republican candidates ran ominous TV ads accusing their Democratic opponents of being 'soft' in their opposition to the 'Victory Mosque'.While only two of the 17 won their races, the die was cast. Fuelled by the nativism and xenophobia Republicans had utilized to build the anti-Obama Tea Party and Birther Movement, they embraced anti-Muslim bigotry as a major theme in their political repertoire. By 2012, during a Republican primary presidential debate, the majority of contenders pledged that they would either refuse to appoint an American Muslim to a post in their administration or, at the very least, would insist they first take a pledge of allegiance to the US before considering them.While this view was not shared by the eventual nominee, Mitt Romney, Muslim-baiting continued to grow within the GOP setting the stage for Donald Trump in 2016. During that year's campaign, Muslims were one of candidate Trump's favoured targets, along with Mexicans, refugees and immigrants, in general. In addition to building a wall to keep out Mexicans, he pledged to stop more Muslims from coming into the country and to keep a close eye on those who were here.It was, therefore, no surprise that shortly after his inauguration, President Trump issued an executive order suspending and placing restrictions on immigrants or refugees coming from seven mostly Arab and Muslim-majority countries. It was punitive and not justified. Those excluded were mostly students, visiting family members, or businesspeople. Visas were cancelled for between 60,000 to 100,000 innocents who were detained, interrogated and many sent back to their countries of origin.In reaction to negative court decisions that he was unfairly singling out Muslims, Trump issued new executive orders increasing the countries covered in his ban. Nevertheless, the list remained largely focused on and adversely affected Arab and Muslim-majority countries.In an equally cruel act, Trump reduced the annual number of refugees admitted into the US, from Obama era highs of over 110,000 to less than 20,000. And while his administration has made much of its concern for Christians, this severe contraction of refugee slots coupled with the ban on immigration from targeted countries has severely impacted Arabs without regard for their faith.The point to note in all of this is that the rhetoric espoused and the policies pursued by the Trump Administration, in fact, have their foundation in a decades-long effort by the GOP to target Arabs and Muslims, and by the failure of Democrats to vigorously confront and defeat these policies. And a by-product of this insidious history has been the role that this bigotry has played in promoting hate crimes against our communities.The well has been poisoned and it will not be easy to undo the damage done. The challenge, however, is clear. We must put our immigration policy back on a sound non-discriminatory basis. We must dramatically increase our admission of refugees and asylees to meet the growing world demand. We must close the loopholes that make Arabs and Muslims fair game for Customs and Border Patrol officials. And we must fight xenophobia, anti-Arab, and anti-Muslim rhetoric and policies and base our relationships with these communities on their being fellow Americans and not on security concernMENAFN2610202000280000ID1101021656"

WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world, I'm Wolf Blitzer in THE SITUATION ROOM. We're following breaking news, America in crisis. Protests underway right now in cities across the United States over the killing of George Floyd.
And tonight, the U.S. is bracing for a possible eighth night of unrest. Curfews already have been issued in New York, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, and other major cities in an effort to prevent more violence. Also, Minnesota's governor has just announced the State Department of Human Rights will investigate the Minneapolis Police Department in the wake of George Floyd's death, to see if it has engaged in systematic discriminatory practices targeting people of color.
Let's begin in Brooklyn, New York right now. Our National Correspondent Jason Carroll is joining us. Jason, lots and lots of people protesting in the streets ahead of the curfew that's scheduled to take effect in what, just under three hours.
JASON CARROLL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, that's right, Wolf. Even before we got out here to Brooklyn in Manhattan, we saw hundreds of demonstrators who are already on the streets of Manhattan, more demonstrators out here in Brooklyn. And those that we've spoken to say that there's a real fear on their part that their message is getting lost because of all of those images of vandalism and looting.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
CARROLL (voice-over): Streets across the nation uneasy as protests continue for an eighth straight day. In Minnesota, where George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police one week and one day ago, still no charges brought against the three police officers who helped restrain Floyd and stood by as Derek Chauvin's knee slowly killed him. The state's governor announcing today the Minneapolis Police Department to undergo civil rights investigation.
GOV. TIM WALZ (D), MINNESOTA: The investigation will review MPD's policies, procedures and practices over the last 10 years to determine if the department has utilized systemic, discriminatory practices towards people of color.
CARROLL (voice-over): Despite calls from Floyd's family for the other officers to be held accountable. Minnesota's Attorney General promising action soon.
ATTORNEY GENERAL KEITH ELLISON (D), MINNESOTA: We plan on taking the proper and deliberate action.
CARROLL (voice-over): Thousands peacefully demonstrated Monday with some law enforcement even showing unity. Police officers taking a knee in Atlanta and Philadelphia. But others turned chaotic in New York City. The looting and violence was rampant. The governor publicly slammed the city's mayor for not deploying more police.
GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D), NEW YORK: What happened in New York City was inexcusable. First, the NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night.
CARROLL (voice-over): Cuomo even suggesting he would override the mayor to secure the streets.
CUOMO: My option is to displace the mayor of New York City and bring in the National Guard.
CARROLL (voice-over): The mayor's office called Cuomo's remarks offensive and the city is changing its curfew from 11:00 to 8:00 p.m. for the rest of the week. As darkness and lawlessness take over some city streets, police officers increasingly in the line of fire. A New York police officer brazenly struck by a car last night in the Bronx captured on video.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That's a -- car.
CARROLL (voice-over): The officer remains in serious condition.
MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO (D), NEW YORK CITY: Anyone who attacks a police officer attacks all of us.
CARROLL (voice-over): And three officers hit by an SUV that barreled through a police barricade in Buffalo. In Las Vegas, one officer shot while four officers struck by gunfire in St. Louis.
CHIEF JOHN HAYDEN, ST. LOUIS POLICE: (INAUDIBLE) and we need to pray for our city and pray for these officers.
CARROLL (voice-over): In other areas, the police coming under scrutiny for their actions. In Atlanta six officers face charges for excessive force while we're moving two college students from a car over the weekend.
MESSIAH YOUNG, MOREHOUSE COLLEGE STUDENT TASED BY ATLANTA POLICE: I feel a little safer now. These monsters are off of the street and no longer able to terrorize anyone else.
CARROLL (voice-over): And Austin's police chief sounding emotional when asked about a young man who was injured by police munitions during a protest.
CHIEF BRIAN MANLEY, AUSTIN POLICE: What I say to you now is my heart is with you. I am praying for your child. And I hope that they have a complete and quick recovery.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
CARROLL: So again, Wolf, tonight the curfew in New York will be at 8:00. Last night, we were out here until 1:00 in the morning with hundreds of people who defied that curfew last night when it was at 11:00, many of them telling us tonight they intend to do the same. Wolf?
[17:05:09]
BLITZER: All right, we'll watch it very closely. It could be rather tense. All right, Jason, thank you.
Let's go to the White House right now. Our Chief White House Correspondent Jim Acosta is on the scene for us. So Jim, what is the situation --
JIM ACOSTA, CNN CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes.
BLITZER: -- like right now over at the White House? What more are you also learning about that very ugly scene that unfolded live here on our air last night?
ACOSTA: Wolf, we can hear the protesters chanting just outside Lafayette Park, we've heard that all afternoon. There was also a moment earlier this afternoon where we could see Secret Service officers and National Guard troops mobilizing in the park as this crowd of demonstrators rose larger near the White House. Now, the Justice Department is claiming this evening that it was Attorney General William Barr who made the decision to clear out the park of peaceful protesters last night.
Some of those law enforcement officers and military forces, as we all remember, used tear gas or gas that looked like tear gas and flashbang. So the President could have a photo opportunity in front of St. John's Episcopal Church. The claim that Barr made that call conflict somewhat with what a senior administration official told us last night the decision was made by the Attorney General along with Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley.
Now, the U.S. Park Police just released a statement defending the response to the protesters saying the demonstrators were beginning to act violently. That is contrary to what multiple journalists including reporters that CNN witnessed.
In the meantime, Wolf, Mr. Trump has been taking something of a victory lap today and patting himself on the back at one point tweeting, D.C. had no problems. Last night. Many arrests. Great job. Done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination. A word he's been using often. Likewise, Minneapolis was great. Thank you, President Trump. There are some White House officials and Trump advisors though who are questioning the President's action. One White House official told me earlier today the park should have been cleared much sooner before this area was so crowded with protesters yesterday evening. And we should also note, former Vice President Joe Biden is condemning Mr. Trump's actions. And here's what he had to say earlier today.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOE BIDEN (D), PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I can't breathe. I can't breathe. George Floyd's last words, but they didn't die with him. They're still being heard. Echoing all across this nation.
A country is crying out for leadership. Leadership that can unite us, leadership that brings us together.
But I promise you this, I won't traffic in fear and division. I won't fanned the flames of hate.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ACOSTA: Now as for the Trump administration, clearly top officials are pointing fingers at one another and trying to avoid blame for what took place yesterday afternoon, Wolf. But I will tell you, I talked to an Episcopal rector who was chased away from St. John's Episcopal Church yesterday. I spoke with her on the phone earlier today.
She described being tear gassed and chased out of that area by those police and military forces. And she called that scene yesterday disgusting and it's really hard to disagree with that scene description from that priest, Wolf.
BLITZER: Yes, certainly is. All right, Jim Acosta, standby for a moment. Alex Marquardt is across the street not very far away from where you are over at Lafayette Park. You got a good crowd of protesters there. What's going on right now because the scene is very different today as opposed to 24 hours ago?
ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Wolf, that's right. That rector that Jim was talking about isn't the only one who was disgusted by what happened yesterday. So we're -- so many of the people here whether they saw it on TV or they were here in person. I just spoke with a young woman who had been hit in the arm by a projectile and had a huge bruise.
So this is a fired up crowd, Wolf. This is a growing crowd. This is a crowd that does not look like it's going anywhere anytime soon. The big difference today, Wolf, is that they have installed this 8 foot tall fence around the northern edge of Lafayette Park. And what that means is that the protesters won't be able to get inside the park without knocking it down. We have seen some violent shaking of that fence.
So -- but if that was meant to deter protesters from showing up, they have certainly failed. This is the fifth day of protests here in Washington, D.C. There's a curfew that is due to go into effect in just about two hours time.
But listening to Jim talk about what the U.S. Park Police said about their justification for that crackdown yesterday, Wolf, it is in stark contrast, I have to say, to what we saw. We were in that protest and utterly peaceful protests for three and a half hours not seeing a single projectile thrown at the police. Before that crackdown started right at 6:30, right as the President was going into the Rose Garden, to declare himself the law and order president.
That crackdown beginning right here with U.S. Park Police firing all manner of projectiles to push out the protesters all the way down this street, H Street so the President could walk right where I am standing, Wolf, across Lafayette Square, which had then been cleared out even though there was still some of that smoke hanging in the air and the protesters who were still lining up against law enforcement over on Connecticut Avenue over there.
[17:10:24]
So the President could come right here and do his photo opportunity outside St. John's Church, which is right there. And incident, Wolf, that the mayor of Washington, D.C. Muriel Bowser said she was shocked and outraged by it, Wolf?
BLITZER: A lot of people who were shocked and outraged by it as well. And that church, St. John's Church, it's right near you. It's right across the street from where you are, right?
MARQUARDT: It is, Wolf. Let me try to parse -- put -- cut through this crowd just to show you a little bit better. So that is St. John's Episcopal Church, right there, often referred to as the Church of the Presidents because it is so close to The White House. So many presidents have gone to worship there, have gone to services there, including President Obama. President Trump did go has been before. He does not go regularly.
And what -- two nights ago when we were out here, when protests did turn violent, when protesters did turn violent, they lit fires, they were throwing things at the police. There was a large fire that was set, pretty much right where I am standing, as well as in the basement room in St. John's Church. And you can see the day after they boarded up that church. What you're looking at right now is an auxiliary building, essentially, which is right behind the main church.
But, yes, this church that the President decided to visit, which he mentioned at the end of his remarks yesterday, he said he was going to visit a special place. That is this church right here. One block away from the White House.
And as we've now learned, Wolf, he wanted to do it because of the reporting about him being in a bunker in the basement of the White House on Friday as these protests exploded, and he didn't like that reporting. He didn't like that image of him being in that bunker, so he wanted to come out here and show his face outside. And that's why all these protesters are so violently cleared away last night, Wolf. BLITZER: Yes. It was a really, really ugly, ugly scene. Peaceful protesters and all of a sudden, the police, military police and Secret Service police moving forward and engaging in activities that they shouldn't have engaged in. And that was before the curfew was supposed to go into effect.
Alex Marquardt, thank you very much. We'll get back to you.
Brian Todd is in Philadelphia right now, which has seen a lot of activity as well. What are you seeing now, Brian?
BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, another very large gathering here in Philadelphia. Thousands of people gathering in the eastern part of the city marching past City Hall into Rittenhouse Square into an area here of South Philadelphia now turning back up towards City Hall.
There were several hundred at first and they were joined by throngs of several hundred more. So we've got thousands with us now. Very, very passionate, doing what they've been doing all week, chanting the names of George Floyd, of Breonna Taylor, the young woman killed in Louisville, and other young African-Americans dying at the hands of police.
What they don't want is for the recent reports that everybody has done about looting and burning in the city. They don't want that to be the central message of what they're doing here. We can tell you that there's also, Wolf, a lot of concern among protesters, about whether police might resort to the kind of tactics that they did yesterday at about this time. They find a lot of tear gas on protesters who are down on the highway, creating a basic stampede of people trying to climb over a fence. That was a horrible scene.
These people here are very concerned. They don't want police to start to do that. The police have defended their actions saying that they were basically provoked into doing that by protesters who harassed a police car who was on that highway and who did not obey orders to disperse from that highway. That's the police defending their actions.
But detentions here are still very high, Wolf, because protesters here just worried that maybe any little thing might provoke the police to resort to similar tactics. But we can tell you also we have some new figures from the last three days, nearly 700 arrests here, most of it for looting or violating curfew or public nuisance. We also have been able to confirm a rash of attacks on ATMs. There were several that were blown up overnight, and one young man was killed trying to blow one up according to city officials.
Still a lot of looting. There was a young looter who was killed by a store owner in South Philadelphia. So the tension is still in the air but also an air of real civil disorder in pockets in the city flaring up overnight. And today, Wolf, still a lot of tension in the air in Philadelphia. But right now, so far, this marks this protest very peaceful, very spirited, very boisterous. And as you can see, heading right to City Hall.
[17:15:01] BLITZER: And there's a curfew scheduled now in Philadelphia, Brian, where you are for 8:30 p.m. tonight, is that right?
TODD: That's correct, Wolf. They're pushing the curfew a little later tonight to 8:30. It was 8:00 last night. It's 8:30 today because there's a Pennsylvania State primary going on. They want to give people a little bit more time to vote. So they're pushing it to 8:30.
Last night when the curfew was implemented, there was a large -- there was a crowd of protesters in front of the police station. There was a standoff there with police. At one point, police took a knee in deference to the protesters. That created a great round of applause, a lot of positive energy and protesters started to disperse.
But then just a few minutes later, police moved in with tactical gear, riot gear, heavily armored vehicles. And you worried at that point that the police were just kind of, you know, resorting to more heavy handed tactics. Luckily, that particular standoff ended peacefully. The protesters dispersed and the rest of the evening was fairly quiet regarding protests, but there was still a lot of crime, a lot of looting overnight.
So the city is still trying to get their arms around all this trying to manage these crowds and trying to, of course, you know, apprehend the looters and the other criminals who -- one local district attorney by the way, Larry Krasner, he told a local affiliate that the vast majority of those looters are young Philadelphians that have nothing to do with these protests, Wolf.
BLITZER: All right, Brian, standby. We're going to get back to you. Brian Todd in Philadelphia. That curfew scheduled for 8:30 tonight.
We're joined now by CNN Anchor Don Lemon, who's been watching all of this very closely. Don, let's talk a little bit about the curfews. I'm looking at a list over here. New York City 8:00 p.m., Washington, D.C. 7:00 p.m., Philadelphia 8:30, Los Angeles 6:00 p.m., Miami 9:00 p.m., Atlanta 9:00 p.m., Louisville 9:00 p.m., Chicago 9:00 p.m., Denver.
These are major American cities and they have curfews, people will not be allowed to go out on the streets after that curfew goes into effect. It says a lot about what's going on in the United States right now.
DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: It says a lot about what's going on the United States. It says a lot about the vacuum of leadership in our country that protesters cannot take to the streets. And people can't figure out the difference between the protesters and the bad actors.
I think it's important to make a distinction between those people, the bad actors and the legitimate protesters. I think law enforcement should be able to get a handle on the difference and put people on the streets to be able to stop the looting and the violence.
But I also think that people should be able to continue to protest to exercise their First Amendment rights, because this has been a long time coming. I am heartened to see the scenes right now on the streets of the city -- of cities, Washington, Philadelphia, so on and so forth, all over the country, where people are exercising their First Amendment right to free speech to gather and to protest.
The farce that it was yesterday, Wolf, as we sat here at this time, and watch the build up to a major photo op that accomplished nothing for the American people, except everything for this President. A photo op that they use to build a video that they could put on a Web site so that they could send out to Twitter on a White House Web site. A photo op that they could possibly use for a campaign ad come November to reelect the President of the United States. That's all that was for yesterday.
At the -- while he was talking about treating everyone equally and protesters fairly, simultaneously, police and military personnel are pushing peaceful protesters back causing violence, the state actually causing violence on the people yesterday. It is a misuse of the office. It is a misuse of the government. It is a misuse of the instruments of the government of the United States.
And I am surprised that Republicans are standing by, many of them are standing by, most of them and not calling this action out. No one wants violence on the streets. That is a given. No American wants violence on the streets. No one wants anyone losing their lives. No one wants anyone losing their property.
But if we don't stand up for the First Amendment rights for the next person, then we will lose ours. So all the people, even if you support President Trump, or whoever you support, Joe Biden, whoever it is, you should be standing up for the rights of these young people to be out on the streets today.
They are exercising their rights as American, protect Americans protected by the Constitution of the United States. I'm not exactly sure what curfew no matter what time considering the anger among these people and the disappointment in our government, especially yesterday evening, I don't know what is going to stop them from being out on the streets except for --
BLITZER: Yes, we're showing --
LEMON: -- possibly martial law.
BLITZER: We're showing our viewers, Don, live pictures, these Washington, D.C., they're not sitting in Washington, D.C. Very peaceful, very peaceful right now.
[17:20:01]
Let's hope it stays like that. Let's hope the police don't move in on all these people who have gathered here in the nation's capital. We saw Philadelphia, we saw in New York, Los Angeles.
Derrick Johnson is with us as well, the President and CEO of the NAACP. Derrick, thanks so much for joining us. What's your reaction when you see these peaceful demonstrations continuing now? It's day eight. DERRICK JOHNSON, PRESIDENT & CEO, NAACP: You know, it -- when you look at the crowd, look at the diversity of the crowd, it shows you that Americans, not only African-Americans, are fed up with the system. They're fed up with this administration.
They're tired of seeing young people, black men killed in broad daylight by police and not held accountable or they're fed up with the current economic picture. They're fed up with the lazy response, the anemic response from this administration to address a global health pandemic.
We have seen this coming for the last four years. We have an administration that lacked the capacity to lead. We have a President that lack the capacity to see outside of the mirror that he looks in. And now we have a situation that we have to suffer through this until we get to November. And I'm looking forward today with all of the people I'm seeing in the streets turn out to the opposed to change this administration.
What we have witnessed in the last 80 days is perhaps, in my opinion, the worst time in American history outside of the Civil War. We've gone from a global pandemic, an anemic response, African-Americans beings impacted at alarming rates as a result of COVID. We've seen someone killed on camera in Georgia.
We've seen someone killed in Minneapolis, we've learned about a woman who her house was invaded by police officers because of a defect of war and they had the person that was looking for apprehended. We see a woman in Central Park practicing her acting skills, which was a racial hate crime because you had a gentleman simply bird watching.
And then we see a district attorney refusing to bring charges holding this whole nation hostage. It was time for peaceful protests. And that's what we're looking at. But unfortunately, we have a President who came to the catered to theatrics as opposed to leading the nation, speaking to everyone and helping us get out of this current situation. Most of us we cannot wait to November to address the current reality.
BLITZER: Derrick, I want you to stand by. Abby Phillip is with us as well. Abby, I think it was very clear the speech, the statement we heard the President deliver yesterday, was in marked contrast to what we heard from the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden earlier today. Very different words.
ABBY PHILLIP, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: It could not have been more different, Wolf. And, you know, that was the whole point on Biden's part is to draw that contrast not just in terms of empathy with the protesters who are on the street talking about how the country moves past this moment, and learns from these protesters who are out on the streets, but also talking about practical ways to actually reform policing in this country.
And that's the point at which, you know, I was literally just reviewing President Trump's statement on George Floyd on Saturday, the one that he gave when he was at the space launch that he gave to a group of reporters. And in that statement, the President says absolutely nothing about systemic racism.
He says nothing about whether or not he believes that this is part of a pattern of policing that needs to be addressed in this country. And he continued to not say anything about either of those things at the Rose Garden yesterday. So this is about blind spot, Wolf.
The President has not addressed this issue. It's one of the reasons the protesters are still out there. And I think you're going to hear a lot about this from his Democratic rival, in Joe Biden. But, you know, Wolf, I want to note, former President George W. Bush put out a statement today that directly addressed the issue of systemic racism in this country. Again, a stark contrast to President Trump, who still has not addressed that at all.
BLITZER: You know, and the former president, Abby, did put out a statement saying that he and his wife Laura, and I'm quoting now, are disturbed by the injustice and fear that suffocate our nation. The statement did not say anything directly about the President's response. But let me get Don Lemon to react to that, once again, a different tone coming from the former President George W. Bush as opposed to the current President.
LEMON: Well, again, that's leadership. The former president is a leader, the former president, in a sense, has sense. The former president cares about the country, puts a country in the office of the presidency ahead of himself.
[17:25:10]
The former president doesn't have dictatorial tendencies. He is, again, he cares about people. He has empathy. This President does not. This President cares only about photo ops. The former president of the United States would realize that the effect for peaceful marches last night had more to do with Terrence Floyd, George Floyd's brother calling for peace yesterday, then for a dictatorial President who seek violence and police officers in the military on peaceful protesters.
So, of course, there's going to be a marked difference between this President and any other president in history. I was quite heartened yesterday to hear one of our former anchors on television, Bernie Shaw, saying -- talking about this presidency and looking at it with a wisdom that Bernie Shaw has saying that this President, this administration will be looked upon in history as an aberration. Let's hope before that aberration happens that we don't lose hundreds of lives in the process.
BLITZER: Standby, Don, everybody standby. We're going to continue our special coverage here in THE SITUATION ROOM. Curfews are going to affect in major American cities from coast to coast, the largest cities in the United States.
And you're seeing live pictures coming in from Washington, D.C. You look at -- this is 16th street here in Washington, D.C. A huge crowd has gathered already there and more people are on their way. Our special live coverage will continue right after a quick break.
[17:31:22]
BLITZER: Peaceful demonstrations are occurring in huge, huge numbers all around the United States right now. We're watching all of them unfold as curfews are getting ready to be imposed in major cities coast to coast.
Let's go to Los Angeles right now. Kyung Lah is on the scene for us. Kyung, what are you seeing, what's going on there?
KYUNG LAH, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: This is a protest that is by, you know, just what I've seen, a larger protest than what we saw in Hollywood yesterday. It has been incredibly peaceful. This is a group that's really trying to get their message out and they are certainly taking care of one another.
And I want you to take a look over, as Jordan raises this camera, you cannot see where it starts and I cannot see where it ends. That's how large it is. A lot of the protesters here are holding up homemade signs.
And something interesting that I'm seeing is that people -- when they confront the police, and they're talking to the police officers who are blocking off the entrances to the freeway, is I'm hearing them say, March with us, make a difference. And there's much more of a sense of unity and connectedness and trying to find a common solution together.
So it's been really an extraordinary day, just from what we've seen. And yesterday, there were some sporadic reports of looting. I have not seen or heard anything like that today. And considering the size of this crowd, Wolf, it really is quite extraordinary. But, you know, essentially all of Hollywood is shut down, as this group marches peacefully to the streets here.
BLITZER: And the curfew in Los Angeles, Kyung, goes into effect 6:00 p.m. Pacific Time, your time, which is 9:00 p.m. here on the east coast. I guess that's being done because of because of what has happened over the past few days, right?
LAH: Yes, it's it's the bad elements who have really caused that curfew to happen. They want to try to clear the streets. And, you know -- I think you're the gentleman I saw earlier talking to the police officer.
JOSEPH HAYNES, DEMONSTRATOR, LOS ANGELES: Yes, ma'am.
LAH: And what's your name?
HAYNES: My name is Joseph Haynes.
LAH: And Joseph, I was really struck by what you told the police officer, and there was a lot of communication between the two of you. Tell me why you want to talk to the police officer. HAYNES: Well, see, I believe that at the end of the day, a lot of these stories that we see specifically in the media -- yes, I'm calling the media out because they're not reporting what's going on half the time with all these things that are occurring. We want peace.
You look at all these wonderful people out here. Look at us. And this is not just black people. These are all people out here and we're trying to tell the police all over the country. If you just marched with us, you're showing that you're not standing in solidarity for a system that has oppressed people for hundreds of years.
We just want you to show that you are with us. Because this is the America that I want my kids to live in and be proud of, that finally stands up to the meaning of its creed. That's what we're here for. What's your name?
LAH: My name is Kyung for the CNN.
HAYNES: God bless you.
LAH: Thank you so much.
HAYNES: Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Thank you.
LAH: So that's just one of the many people we're seeing here march through Hollywood, just a sampling, Wolf. However many people are out here and it's a lot of them.
BLITZER: Yes, they're certainly are. All right, Kyung, be careful over there. I see a lot of the people at least engaging in some social distancing as they march, but plenty of others are not. Some are wearing masks. Some are not. We'll watch that closely together with you Kyung Lah in LA.
Ryan Young is on the scene for us in Chicago right now. Ryan, what are you seeing there?
RYAN YOUNG, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, we're about two hours into this protest. And I can tell you a few thousand people are here. Take a look here, they've marched down to this location right now.
[17:35:01]
And you can see a line of officers that stand just about on the other side here. This protest has been remained absolutely peaceful and they've been having a sort of meetings and conversations in different intersections. They sort of talk about the platform that they want to get out there. At some points, they even engage with police officers.
Right now, there's a -- just a group of speakers who are talking to them. This is such a big difference between what we saw over the weekend where we had large protests that sometimes went out of hand. This is not the case here. The last two days has been completely organized, and on top of that has remained peaceful and these larger protests now. Last night, there was some small amounts of looting, but it had nothing to do with the peaceful protesters who were walking through the streets. Again, you look at this crowd, it's like thousands of people, it stretched block after block after block. I'll kind of walk you through this direction right now to and kind of show you just how large this crowd is.
And what we've noticed is they've asked for police reforms, they've talked about George Floyd, and they said they want to make sure there's a civilian review board that they could start seeing some differences throughout the country when it comes to policing.
On top of that, there's a tremendous amount of heat here in Chicago, so we've had several people unfortunately need medical attention out at this protest because of the extreme heat. But, again, Wolf, what a big difference. Think about Sunday, there was 699 arrests made during some of the protests and some of the looting. That's not the case that's happening right now.
BLITZER: Well, that's a very impressive crowd indeed. Ryan Young on the scene for us. Ryan, standby.
New York City is extending its 8:00 p.m. curfew for the rest of this week after protests did lead to some violence and looting last night. But the Mayor Bill de Blasio says the National Guard and other armed forces are not needed.
Joining us now is the Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams. He's a former captain in the New York Police Department. Thanks so much for joining us, Eric. You spent more than two decades in the NYPD, you also founded a group to fight police brutality. How do you make sense of the scenes that we're seeing unfold not only in New York City but around the country?
ERIC ADAMS, BROOKLYN BOROUGH PRESIDENT: Wolf, I cannot tell you how I feel right now. The emotion, the pain I saw when we saw George Floyd on the ground, with his foot on his neck. It reminded me as a child being beat by police and urinating blood for weeks after that beating and going into the police department and fighting against police abuse. This is a moment for me and the emotion is unbelievable.
And seeing young people are taken to the streets across our country, and stated that these are the children of these civil rights fighters, it brings me joy, but it also brings me concern and I must be clear about that. You cannot end violence by using violence.
And what has happened particularly here in New York City and other big cities, they have professional agitators who are attempting to hijack a righteous fight to end police abuse. And their goal is not to end police abuse in my opinion, their goal is to see how cities burns and we cannot allow that to happen.
But now these new peaceful marches of different ethnicities, this is what I've always look forward to. And I'm just really pleased with what Americans are doing across the country. BLITZER: Your city, New York City, Eric, has now moved the curfew up to 8:00 p.m. tonight, it was 11:00 p.m. last night. Do you think that will help prevent some of that ugly looting that we all saw on the streets of New York last night?
ADAMS: I believe that I am in support of the curfew as long as it's not a tool that's used to stop people from voicing their right to protest. The historical not only police abuse, but all of the issues. The police officer having his foot or knee on the neck of Floyd was just about Americans, and particularly those of color saying they had to put on their neck throughout the virus throughout the homelessness, throughout all of these issues.
And so I'm hoping that those who are really taking control of this protest is not going to allow people to hijack it. And the -- some of the looting that you have witnessed is not what this is about, and those who are using this as a method to go in and create crimes, we cannot accept that. Our cities can't burn, because our police, this city when crime was at high, when our homes were burned, we're not going to go back to that. But we're not also going to return to the days of police abuse.
BLITZER: You served for many years in the NYPD. As you know, your Governor Andrew Cuomo says the response last night by the Mayor Bill de Blasio and the NYPD, in Cuomo's word was inexcusable. He called the response a disgrace. How do you respond to that?
ADAMS: I think now is not the time to use terminologies that's going to divide us. I want -- I reached out to the governor this afternoon and I communicated with him and I've also been in contact with the mayor. It's time for both of them to show a united front and state that we're going to use whatever means and measures that are within the law to protect the people of this city, protect them, not only their right to protest, but the right to ensure that we don't destroy a city that we built throughout the years.
[17:40:15]
Many people don't know this was gutted-out city. The buildings were gutted-out and destroyed and no one wants to hear we're not going back to those days. But we're not going to go back to the days where young men like me would lay on the police floor and be beaten repeatedly by police officer. I did not give my life as a cop to change that. And I'm not going to give up and surrender my life as the activist and an elected official. We're going to move forward together in a safe manner.
BLITZER: And you are the Brooklyn Borough President. The Mayor Bill de Blasio is rejecting President Trump's call to bring in the National Guard. Do you think the NYPD needs that help or would that only potentially inflame the situation further?
ADAMS: We cannot -- Wolf, we cannot ignore the fact that the President has been a complete embarrassment to our nation. He has created the level of division that we are experiencing. And any advice that comes from that -- the occupation of the White House is something that we don't need right now. I think that if we use the proper police practices and tactics, then we can ensure the safety of New Yorkers without having to escalate to a level that we can return from.
Let's remember, the National Guard has presented a lot of pain to many people during the civil rights era. We do need to use them, they are not to be used in an enforcement aspect. They can be used in a very tactical way to protect property. But the police, the well-trained police should be used to interact with the crowd. And those who don't have the capacity.
And this is what I say often, every police is not made for every task but in the police department. We need to understand that and we need to have those who have the mental capacity to deal with the stress on the frontline of a issue of this magnitude there. I've had people spit in my face. I've had people throw rocks at me as a police officer.
I marched during the day and didn't put on the uniform to protect marchers at night. And I know you have to write -- I have to write demeanor to do something of this magnitude, and we need to start doing that without police departments.
BLITZER: Eric Adams is the Brooklyn New York Borough President, a former NYPD police officer, a captain in the NYPD. Good luck to you. Good luck to everyone in New York. Good luck to everyone around the country. These are really, really sensitive, delicate moments right now. Thanks so much for joining us.
ADAMS: Thank you. Take care, Wolf.
BLITZER: All right. We're going to continue our special coverage here in THE SITUATION ROOM. We'll squeeze in a quick break. Our special coverage will continue right after this.
[17:45:29]
BLITZER: There's a news conference going on in Houston. This is a Steven Jackson, former NBA player who was a friend of George Floyd's. Let's listen in.
STEVEN JACKSON, FORMER NBA PLAYER: We going to put my brother to -- we're going to send him home in beautiful ways this week, but I'm telling you, we are not leaving. We're demanding justice. And I'm tired of seeing that. I'm not going to see her hurt every day like this.
We need justice. We demand it, and some kind of way. God damn it, we going to get it. Thank you all for coming. But this shot has to stop, man. It has to stop.
CHRIS STEWART, ATTORNEY TO GEORGE FLOYD: You know, we'd literally flew up here from Atlanta where today the district attorney indicted six officers who were involved in beating those college students and tasering them. The district attorney, the mayor, and our chief of police took action in under a week, fired and indicted. But yet here, we're still waiting for the arrest of the other officers. Why can't that be a blueprint of what should happen in these officer-involved situations? The pictures last forever, but justice never truly comes in this. And time and time again, we're fighting these cases.
You know, we literally flew up here from Atlanta, where today the district attorney indicted six officers who were involved in beating those college students and tasering them. The district attorney, the mayor, and our chief of police took action in under a week fire and indicted. But yet here, we're still waiting for the arrest of the other officers.
Why can't that be a blueprint of what should happen in these often involves situations? The pictures last forever. But justice never truly comes in this and time and time again, we're fighting these cases.
Everybody at home is wondering why riots are happening, why protesting is happening. It is because situations like this do not get addressed. No one is saying that every police officer out there is out to try and kill somebody. But when someone does do something, when someone crosses the line, they have to go through the system and be held accountable. How is that not fair?
And it always happens to African-Americans. And the end result is this. And it's a circle because then it's held against a young African-American child when they don't have a parent, when they don't have a father. Now, we're somehow less than equal because we're missing that dad.
Well, this is going to be the reason that Gianna is missing that dad, through no fault of her own, through no fault of his. So this helps that cycle and it has to end. And we plan on fighting until the end to make sure that that happens even with new policies being instituted, with the investigation that was announced today. We hope to see further steps, so that this never happens again.
JUSTIN MILLER, ATTORNEY: With that, we'll take a few questions.
STEWART: And very few, because this is a rough day.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Could Roxie just talk about the man George was, and father? And give us some beautiful memories of him.
ROXIE WASHINGTON, MOTHER OF GEORGE'S FLOYD'S YOUNGEST DAUGHTER: He was a good man as a father. He was so happy to have her. He was there. He slept the whole time that I went through labor, but when he heard her cry, he got up. He woke up. And I still have a picture of him waking up and getting his baby. He loved her. He loved her so much.
STEWART: All right. One last question.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All right, can you tell us a little bit about what he told you where he wanted to move to Minneapolis? Why did he want to move? What did he tell you? WASHINGTON: To work, to seek work, job opportunity.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you feel like he was going to achieve his goal?
WASHINGTON: Yes, he was. He was.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He was able to be and remain a part of (INAUDIBLE).
WASHINGTON: Of course, he was. He still took care of us. He lived here, but we still had that connection. And he still took care of us. He provided for us, even living here working.
JACKSON: That was his main reason for moving. When he called me, his whole reason for coming was to get here, get away from Texas, so he can come and provide for his family. Be a better father, be a better provider.
His whole reason for being in Minnesota was to work and drive trucks. That's why he came here. And he was doing that. He was doing great here. He was turning the curve. And then this happened.
[17:50:05]
So he was doing his part.
STEWART: So we hope you all see the human side of George and not just pictures and videos on the internet. And that he has a legacy, a beautiful legacy, that no matter how rough and chaotic the world looks right now, this beautiful little girl is going to have a bright future.
JACKSON: Yes, indeed.
STEWART: And, you know, like he said, Jay said, we're going to guarantee that.
JACKSON: Yes.
STEWART: Making sure everybody's held accountable and making sure that her future is bright. So, now associate this beautiful little face when you all think of that memory. And when you see images or some outlets trying to bring up things to destroy a man's name, you think of this every single time you see him like that.
JACKSON: You all should know this is the frustration I have. This is my brother's six-year old daughter. I have a daughter. So this is my frustration. You all want to know why I'm here? Why I'm standing, why I'm here? Because my brother's daughter have to live without him.
Look at the tears from Roxie. This is why I'm here. I'm too crying. I'm ready to fight. I'm ready to stand for my brother. I'm ready to get justice for my brother. That's why I'm here. Don't ask me that no more.
STEWART: Thank you all.
WASHINGTON: Thank you.
BLITZER: All right, very emotional moment. The little six-year old girl Gianna, the daughter of George Floyd, her mother, Roxie Washington, you saw her crying. Stephen Jackson, the former NBA player, obviously understandably angry at what's going on right now. That was a powerful moment.
Let me get Don Lemon to react to what we just saw. What a sweet little girl and so sad, Don, that she's lost her dad.
LEMON: Anyone who has a family can relate to those pictures and are heartbroken by that little girl. She is stunned, she is six years old standing there, wondering what is going on. Imagine your six-year old having to go through the same thing to lose a father.
And I think it was quite appropriate for them to tell George Floyd's story about why he was in Minneapolis, what he was doing trying to provide for his family. Not all families are able to be together. Sometimes people grow apart and they separate, that happens to many, many families in this country. But yet and still the parents have a relationship and a connection where they provide for the child and they co-parent together. And that's what Roxie and George Floyd were doing for a little Gianna.
And I think this is a truly American story. When you look at this family and you look at that little girl and the mother of the child crying in tears. The mom couldn't get a word out without crying, saying he loved her talking about the day she was -- Gianna was born. And him being there and sleeping on the couch and sleeping in the hospital and holding her while she went into labor. And as soon as she was born, holding his daughter said she took care of -- he took care of us, he provided for us.
He came to Minnesota to be able to provide for us. He loved her so much. He said -- that's what this story is about. It's about families who are torn apart, about loved ones who are pulled from their families, whose lives are extinguished. People who lose their lives at the hands of police officers every single year and those officers are not held accountable. And this is not about the looting and the violence.
We have crime all over this country. And we take care of it every day. But this issue we need to take care of now, Wolf.
BLITZER: Yes. You know, I want to play another little clip. Gianna, the adorable six-year old little girl, Gianna's mother, Roxie Washington, you saw her in tears right now, Gianna, the daughter of George Floyd. I want to play this clip earlier Roxie Washington said this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
WASHINGTON: I don't have a lot to say because I can't get my words together right now. But I want everybody to know that this is what -- those officers took from --
JACKSON: It's all right, baby.
WASHINGTON: At the end of the day, they get to go home and be with their families. Gianna does not have a father. He will never see her grow up, graduate. He will never walk her down the aisle.
[17:55:06]
If there's a problem she's having and she needs her dad. She does not have that anymore. I'm here for my baby. And I'm here for George, because I want justice for him. I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good. And this is the proof that he was a good man.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BLITZER: What a heartbreaking moment that we've been watching Roxie Washington, the mother of little Gianna, six years old. She's the daughter of George Floyd, who was killed by police in Minneapolis a little bit more than a week ago.
Don, it's so heartbreaking to think this sweet little girl is now going to have to grow up without her dad.
LEMON: Yes. And, you know, I can only relate it to anyone -- the only way I can convey this as anyone who is watching. Wolf, you know, you walk your daughter down the aisle, right?
BLITZER: Mm-hmm.
LEMON: Every dad wants to walk their daughter down the aisle. Every daughter wants her dad to walk them down the aisle. Every daughter wants to go -- that connection that daughters and dads have. Every daughter wants to go when they have a problem, as Roxie Washington said. They go to their fathers, and they want their father to handle it.
They want the man in the house to handle it. The man in their life. And so many things that she's going to miss out, she's going to turn in and look for her father at graduation and he won't be there and look for him at whatever sporting event she may be. She may be an athlete, who knows. She may be a cheerleader, she may become president of United States, who knows.
But then she won't have her father there for her for that. She will had this searing memory in her life of what we saw on videotape. Sadly, this little girl -- and I hope that it is a motivating factor for her whether -- rather than one that causes her to have more pain, I want this to help her achieve greatness. I hope that that's a --this is a motivating factor for her.
BLITZER: We certainly all hope and we couldn't agree with you more. Don, don't go away and we're going to continue our special live coverage here in The SITUATION ROOM. Demonstrations unfolding all over the country. Curfews are about to be imposed in major cities from coast to coast. Our special coverage here in THE SITUATION ROOM will continue right after a very quick break. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What do we want?
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKERS (in unison): Justice!

BROOKE BALDWIN, CNN HOST: Hi there. I'm Brooke Baldwin. Thank you so much for being with me on this Monday. You're watching CNN.
We begin with this urgent warning, this warning from more than 200 scientists to the CDC and the World Health Organization that the coronavirus can float in the air in smaller droplets than previously thought, and the public needs to be on alert, that message delivered in an open letter.
And it comes as 32 states begin this new week where they ended the last one, in a fight to contain the spread, several states posting records yet again.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DR. PETER HOTEZ, BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE: Clearly, our current approach, if you call it that, is not working.
By the time we're -- for the fall election, I'm sure we will easily be at 100,000 cases a day, as Dr. Fauci predicts, and we might even be more -- might even be at a higher level than that. So we're in freefall, if we don't stop it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BALDWIN: Despite the surge, many Americans shrugged off the thread over the holiday weekend.
The Michigan medical director says police were aware of this lake party -- look at this -- but lacked the authority to enforce social distancing. And despite a statewide mandate requiring masks in public, you can see most people there are not at all wearing one.
And you know similar scenes played out nationwide. And the White House minimizing the risk and touting their questionable record, as the U.S. nears three million cases.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Now we have tested almost 40 million people. By so doing, we show cases, 99 percent of which are totally harmless.
KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I think the world is looking at us as a leader in COVID-19.

BALDWIN: We should note that, just last week, one of the president's top officials debunked Trump's claim that the spike is the result of more testing.
Admiral Brett Giroir testifying to Congress that a jump in positivity results tells him and others that -- quote -- ""This is a real increase in cases.""
Let's turn to Florida now, one of the hardest-hit states, where coronavirus cases topped over 200,000. Florida set a record for new infections on the 3rd of July, more than 11,000 in just that one day. And now Miami-Dade, the state's most populated county, is rolling back reopening plans.
CNN's Rosa Flores is live from Miami Beach.
And so what are the restrictions that are now going into place?
ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You know, Brooke, experts warned about this. If the number of cases didn't drop, this was going to happen.
Miami-Dade County announcing today that it's rolling back some of the reopening plans. They are closing down restaurants again, allowing only takeout and delivery. They're closing down fitness centers, party venues, short-term vacation rentals.
And officials here are citing the numbers, the increase in hospitalizations, and also the need of ICU beds and ventilators. The concern, too, is large gatherings in public -- in public places.
Now, here's what Governor Ron DeSantis said during a press conference today about theme parks and Disney. Take a listen.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): The theme parks have been doing great. Disney, I have no doubt, is going to be a safe environment. I think that where you start to see the spread is just in social situations, where people let their guard down, usually like a private party or something like that.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
FLORES: Now, Brooke, here in Miami-Dade, on the other hand, they're concerned both of what's happening in private, with private parties happening in homes, but also what's happening out at restaurants and public venues -- Brooke.
BALDWIN: What's the story also, Rosa, in Florida with contact tracing? Apparently, there's very limited contact tracing happening there. Why?
FLORES: The CNN Health unit interviewed 27 Floridians that tested positive for COVID-19. And according to these individuals, only five of them were contacted by the Health Department for contact tracing purposes.
Now, I remembered that, here in Miami-Dade, Mayor Carlos Gimenez announced on May 14 that the county was getting ready to hire 800 to 1,000 contact tracers. So we contacted the county today asking how many people they had hired.
Well, the answer, Brooke, was zero. And here is why. According to the county -- quote -- ""In Florida, the Florida Department of Health is the only entity authorized to conduct contact tracing.""
Now, Brooke, process this with me for just a moment, because Miami- Dade County is the epicenter of the crisis here in the state of Florida, accounting for 24 percent of the more than 206,000 cases in the state. So you would think that it's all hands on deck.
And we have asked the state why Miami-Dade County can't help with the contact tracing. And we're waiting to hear back -- Brooke.
[15:05:05]
BALDWIN: Keep calling them. Blow them up. That needs to change.
Rosa Flores, thank you so much in Miami Beach.
People in Texas are being urged to shelter in place. Hospitals in two counties have already reached capacity, as coronavirus cases surge statewide. And officials are sounding the alarm, as ICU beds and ventilators are coming dangerously close to being fully in use, as the number of cases continues to climb all across the state, really suggesting it is only a matter of days until hospitals are overwhelmed.
Listen to this:
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
STEVE ADLER (D), MAYOR OF AUSTIN, TEXAS: If we don't change the trajectory we're on now, that, in 10 days to two weeks, we're going to have overwhelmed hospitals and overwhelmed ICUs.
And it's not just the physical space. It's the health care professionals. It's the doctors and skilled nurses. And it's beginning to look like Houston and Dallas and San Antonio are all going to be competing with that same talent as Austin here in a couple weeks.
And that has great concern.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BALDWIN: Speaking of Houston, joining me now, Dr. Ben Saldana, a medical director of the freestanding emergency care centers for Houston Methodist Hospital.
So, Dr. Saldana, thank you so much for being on with me. Welcome.
DR. BEN SALDANA, HOUSTON METHODIST HOSPITAL: Thanks for having us.
BALDWIN: So, your hospital is seeing a surge, in the same way we saw across New York City and those hospitals back in March. As of today, what is your top concern?
SALDANA: Yes, so I think what I can tell you about the Houston environment is that Houston Methodist has seen in the past four months about 3,000 admissions for COVID.
We know that, at our peak in the mid-April, we have already tripled those numbers here in Houston at Houston Methodist. And so, as we are prepared to double those numbers, we are asking our public to take heed to the strict handwashing, the social distancing and the mask wearing.
So I think that's, that's our greatest concern is getting the message out to take these things serious.
BALDWIN: You know, I was reading about you today. You have been at Houston Methodist, Doctor, for almost two decades. You have been on the front lines of planning during the Ebola crisis, during hurricanes.
You know, when you think about this pandemic -- and I have read that doctors in Houston, say, vs. New York in the spring, you know, now have a broader knowledge about how to manage the sickest patients and are often more able to avoid breathing tubes and ventilators and critical care.
Why do you think that is?
SALDANA: Yes, so I think there's a couple of things.
First of all, many of us in Houston trained in New York City. We had the privilege of thriving through HIV/AIDS, 9/11, SARS, anthrax. And so all that experience brought with us the knowledge of how to address these kinds of issues.
So, in the past four months, what we have also learned from our colleagues around the nation is what better treatments that we can use. So, often, during the first surge, an older population required ventilator use early. And now we know, with the second surge in Houston, seems to be a younger population.
That younger population, we have learned, can do things like proning to aerate parts of the lung, to increase that oxygenation, without the use of ventilators early on. There are other therapies use at use that experimental that seem to be doing well as well.
But that's kind of, I think, the difference in why you might not be hearing the need for ICU ventilators at this point. BALDWIN: Quite like we were, quite like we were in New York City in March. I just think that is such an important distinction. Thank you for explaining that to us.
Let me throw -- I want to put a graphic up on the screen, Dr. Saldana, of just the timeline of the hospitalizations since Texas reopened.
And when you look at that curve upwards, the trajectory is frightening. And then you have some urging Governor Abbott there in Texas to empower local government to issue stay-at-home orders.
As a doctor, just right there on the front lines, what do you think it'll take to get that graphic moving in the right direction?
SALDANA: So, I think it's going to take, first of all, just continuing with the messaging.
We are lucky to have great medical leadership here at Houston Methodist and in the Med Center. All the CEOs, CNOs and quality leaders in the E.R. as well have collectively gathered every evening to discuss rates, help each other with bed management, so that we all share our patient population.
I think that there are conversations that happen with the governor and his leadership to make sure that there's an understanding of the realities of what's available to us and what really needs to happen.
I think some of the requests for mandated masking now and closing of the beaches this past weekend was a step in the right direction. It's really up to us. I think we need to in the public just be aware.
[15:10:03]
The way that we're going to show we care is by wearing a mask, social distance, and adhere to strict hand hygiene.
BALDWIN: No, I hear all your messaging. And I hope Texans are listening.
And Dr. Ben Saldana, thank you for all you're doing and all that you have left to do here during this pandemic. Appreciate you. Thank you very much.
I want to take everyone from Texas now to Illinois. The city of Chicago, once a hot spot in the pandemic, has now seen new cases drop dramatically in recent weeks. And now the city has a new rule to keep it that way.
Starting today, Chicago is requiring anyone traveling to the city from any of these 15 states to quarantine for two weeks. Violators could be subject to a fine of up to $500.
So with me now, the commissioner for the Public -- the Chicago Department of Public Health, Dr. Allison Arwady.
So, Dr. Arwady, thank you for being with me. And let's just go right to that list. You know, what was the criteria for choosing those things 15 states?
DR. ALLISON ARWADY, COMMISSIONER, CHICAGO DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH; Absolutely.
So, we felt like we had to do everything we could to protect the progress that we have made here in Chicago. We're at a point where we're seeing record lows in hospitalizations, record lows in death going back to March.
And so these states are places where there are more than 15 cases every day per 100,000 population. That means they're at levels twice what we're seeing in Chicago, and they're at a level of an outbreak back where we were under shelter at place -- in place.
But in these states, there are not shelter-in-place orders. So we have put an order in place saying that, if folks travel from those states, including Chicagoans who go to visit, if they return to Chicago, they need to quarantine for 14 days before they can be out and about.
BALDWIN: Now, it is one thing to put this order in place. It is quite another to enforce it.
How will you plan on forcing people to comply? And how will those fines work?
ARWADY: Sure.
So our main goal here is really, first and foremost, to educate people into doing the right thing. So people will be getting information at the airport. They will be getting information as they're booking tickets. We're having our hotels and our Airbnbs make sure that people have that understanding as they're looking to book information.
We're putting info up on the highways for people who are driving in. But we're not going to be pulling over people with out-of-state licenses. We're not going to be making big lists of people to track them down.
Primarily, if we determine, in the case of -- as we're doing our case investigations, that someone has violated this order, it gives us the authority to put those fines in, up to $500 per day for anyone who is found to not be in compliance with the order.
But, mainly, we want to educate people into doing the right thing, let them know that right now is not the time to be having nonessential travel to any of those places.
BALDWIN: No, it certainly -- with that list, that is sending a strong message.
Dr. Allison Arwady in Chicago, thank you so much on those new restrictions starting today.
Meantime, the polls. The polls show the president's political standing falling. So he is again blaming China for the coronavirus and peddling outright lies about how the U.S. is handling it, attributing spiking case numbers to increase testing and claiming it is under control.
The president is also holding closely to culture war symbols and tweeting about them just to light a fire under his political base. Just last hour, this tweet: ""They named teams out of strength, not weakness. But now the Washington Redskins and Cleveland Indians, two fabled sports franchises, look like they're going to be changing their names in order to be politically correct.""
Also prominently featured in the president's daily Twitter rant, the Confederate Flag. He criticized both NASCAR's decision to ban the Confederate Flag from its racetracks and said Bubba Wallace, the sports' only black driver, should apologize after the FBI determined that a noose was found in his garage at Talladega was, in fact, not part of a hate crime.
Wallace, for his part, has responded with this -- quote -- ""Love over hate every day. Love should come naturally, as people are taught to hate, even when it's hate from the president of the United States.""
Gun deaths are now spiking across America, with so many children among the victims. I will talk to the mayor of Atlanta, who says that she is fighting -- quote, unquote -- ""the enemy within.""
Plus, New York City is concerned about spiking numbers in other states. So, indoor dining is now off the table again.
And an army soldier is the victim of a grisly crime, and now her family is calling for change in the military.
You're watching CNN. I'm Brooke Baldwin. We will be right back.
[15:18:53]
BALDWIN: We're back. You're watching CNN. I'm Brooke Baldwin.
There is nothing worse than burying your child. Today, the parents of at least six children across the country will have to suffer through that inescapable grief, after gun violence stole the lives of their kids.
Secoriea Turner, she was 8. She died in her mother's arms in Atlanta. Davon McNeal, he was 11. He was killed running into his aunt's Washington, D.C., house to grab a phone charger. Natalia Wallace, she was 7. She was playing outside in her Chicago neighborhood when a bullet struck her in the head.
Royta De'Marco Giles, he was 8. He was caught in the middle of a gun battle inside a Hoover, Alabama, shopping mall. An unnamed 6-year-old boy in San Francisco and a 14-year-old in Chicago.
Just one child is too many, but six in 72 hours is a national wakeup call. Let's go straight to CNN's Omar Jimenez minutes in Chicago, where at least 77 people were shot over this weekend.
And, Omar, tragedy piled on top of tragedy, but the Chicago mayor says there decades of inequities fueling the violence.
[15:20:04]
OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Brooke.
Well, it's the ecosystem of public safety, is how Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot described it to me. And they're operating at the intersection of coronavirus and gun violence.
And many of the same communities that have most been affected by this pandemic are being most affected by violence. And when you look at this summer and what we have seen so far specifically, of course, you're dealing with the typical challenges of summer violence.
But, on top of that, we have had first responders, including police officers, who have tested positive for coronavirus or died. The jail has seen hundreds of detainees test positive or die. Courts have had to close at one point or another.
So, Mayor Lightfoot says all of these factors come together to create this current reality.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
LORI LIGHTFOOT (D), MAYOR OF CHICAGO, ILLINOIS: Violence is a manifestation of much larger social problems. It's a factor of poverty, lack of jobs, lack of education, and lack of hope.
All of these forces are coming together at the same time and making it very difficult.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
JIMENEZ: And one of the most difficult parts of this is, this is now a third week in a row in Chicago where children have now been killed, children that range in ages from 10 years old, 3 years old, 1-year- old, and, of course, this past weekend, a 7-year-old.
And the family of 3-year-old, Mekhi James, who died in recent weeks told me and gave me insight to a grim reality that they are now living firsthand, funerals where children are now carrying the caskets of children.
BALDWIN: Omar, thank you.
With me now, the mayor of Atlanta, Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms.
So, Mayor Bottoms, thank you so much for being with me.
And I want to just get right to Secoriea, 8 years of age. You said it over the weekend. She was a baby. How could this happen? KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS (D), MAYOR OF ATLANTA, GEORGIA: You know, Brooke, that's the question that we're all asking ourselves.
And, ironically, I found a note on my desk, and I don't even know the context in which I wrote this out. But I said, I don't know the answers because I often don't even know the questions to ask.
And I was listening to Mayor Lightfoot. She summed it up. We talk about systemic racism and the trauma and anxiety and all these things that are happening in our communities. And it is this convergence.
And I hate to use the word a perfect storm, but it's where we are in this country right now. And you think about the leadership or the lack there of that we have coming from the highest office in the land. I think that you are seeing so many emotions play out.
And so, too often, it's playing out in violence in our streets.
BALDWIN: I want to come back to this concept in the community of a perfect storm, but I do want to ask about the family first.
We know the family last night was calling on the community to work to help find who killed their daughter. Do you have an update, Mayor Bottoms, just on the search for Secoriea's killer? Is there any progress there? And have you spoken with the family today?
BOTTOMS: I have not spoken with the family today, but we have received a number of tips. So we are encouraged by that.
There are so many peaceful people in the area and so many people who've been gathering in a peaceful way throughout our city over the past few weeks. So, this is -- has not been received well by so many people of good conscience. And people are speaking up.
And, hopefully, we will have something more concrete soon.
BALDWIN: OK.
And then you made it clear when you were speaking last night these are folks in the same community shooting each other. And as you also point out, you cannot blame police. Why?
BOTTOMS: Well, the point that I was hoping to make, and I hope that it was received that way in the way in which I was intending, the irony of this is that this is on a site that was supposed to be a tribute to a man who was killed by police, who spoke about his daughter's eighth birthday the next day.
He spoke about her birthday party in his encounter with a police officer. And the irony was that, in -- this place of peace and what should have been a place of honor and tribute turned into deadly violence.
There were two shooters is what Secoriea's mothers said. One shot from that parking lot of the Wendy's, and one shot from the parking lot that she was attempting to make a U-turn in. And so it is -- there are separate issues, but the result is still the same.
There is injustice and there is police brutality in America, period. But there's also this violence that's erupting on our streets, often between people within the same community, that is also a problem.
[15:25:12]
And to someone like Secoriea's parents to her nearly 50 loved ones who were with us on -- yesterday, the result is still the same. Somebody who they love is gone. And I think that we have to deal with both of these issues, and we can't deal with them if we want to put our heads in the sand and act as if they don't exist.
BALDWIN: To that point, you said this last night -- quote -- ""During the civil rights movement, there was a common enemy. Now we're fighting from within.""
So two questions: How do you stop that infighting, and then what or who, in your view, is that common enemy?
BOTTOMS: Well, in the civil rights movement, there was a -- there was this defined objective. And that objective was to receive equal rights for all Americans, particularly African-Americans, during that time.
This movement is a very different movement. It's a more global movement. And I think that, at this moment in time, when you have so many people interested in making change across the globe, I don't think that it is helpful to this movement, when it is being overshadowed by violence and things and instances that are taking away from the importance of this movement.
And so I think that this enemy that we have to confront is violence. And whether it's violence from interactions with police officers, whether it's violence within our communities, the impact is still the same on our communities. It's destroying our communities.
And I think that they are equally important conversations. I think that we can have the same conversation. I think we can -- we have the ability to have this conversation simultaneously.
But when you have a child, an 8-year-old child who is killed just feet away from the site where we are protesting the killing of an unarmed black man, then we have got to acknowledge that we have got some layers of issues in our communities, and we have got to confront them both with the same anger and with the same sense of urgency.
BALDWIN: Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, I appreciate you speaking up and out on this. And thank you for taking the time with me.
And, of course, our condolences to Secoriea's family. Thank you.
BOTTOMS: Thank you.
BALDWIN: New York City's restaurants still not allowed to have indoor dining. Coming up, I will talk to a restaurant owner about the challenge of just trying to stay open safely and survive."
48,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1251/Files (250).DOCX","The New York Times - International Edition",2020-06-19,"1865 words","US","Lisa Lerer, Giovanni Russonello and Isabella Grullón Paz",NA,"On L.G.B.T.Q. Rights, a Gulf Between Trump and Many Republican Voters",FALSE,"As more Republicans say they support at least some L.G.B.T.Q. protections, President Trump and party leaders continue to stand in opposition and particularly target transgender Americans.
When President George W. Bush needed to shore up support with social conservatives during his re-election run in 2004, he turned to a familiar political tactic: demonizing L.G.B.T.Q. rights. On the campaign trail and from the White House, the Republican leader began championing a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, praising unions between a man and woman as ""critical to the well-being of families.""
Sixteen years later, when another issue of L.G.B.T.Q. rights popped up in the midst of another presidential campaign, the Republican incumbent responded with little more than a shrug.
""They ruled and we live with their decision,"" President Trump told reporters after the Supreme Court issued a decision on Monday protecting the rights of L.G.B.T.Q. workers. ""That's what it's all about. We live with the decision of the Supreme Court.""
For decades, most Republican leaders have opposed L.G.B.T.Q. civil and marriage rights, views that remain embedded in the party's platform and its activist base. Last weekend, party activists in Virginia punished Representative Denver Riggleman, a first-term Republican, for officiating a same-sex marriage ceremony; they chose a self-described ""biblical conservative"" as their G.O.P. nominee for November. And the Trump administration continues to limit civil rights protections for transgender people and bar most of them from military service.
Yet today, widespread battles over L.G.B.T.Q. rights are less frequent among parts of the Republican Party - not just among some corporate leaders and political donors who dislike openly bigoted fights, but also among many of the rank-and-file Republicans who say in polling that they support at least some rights and protections for L.G.B.T.Q. people.
Last year, according to Pew, roughly three in five Americans said they supported same-sex marriage - up from half that share in 2004. Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, 44 percent supported same-sex marriage last year, up from 19 percent. Wide majorities of the country also support extending workplace protections to L.G.B.T.Q. Americans, according to surveys taken before the Supreme Court's ruling.
The consensus was so broad that last year, even among white Republican men over age 50 holding favorable views of Mr. Trump, 52 percent said that workplace protections and other nondiscrimination laws should apply to L.G.B.T.Q. people, according to a Public Religion Research Institute poll.
""On L.G.B.T. rights, everyone has moved on this issue,"" Robert Jones, the founder of PRRI, said in an interview, referring to voters across the political spectrum. ""Whether you're talking about marriage equality, nondiscrimination protection - everybody has moved. Seniors have moved, white evangelicals have moved, base Republicans have moved.""
In interviews this week, several Republican voters in battleground states reacted to the Supreme Court ruling by expressing support broadly for civil rights for L.G.B.T.Q. people. Some were gently critical of Mr. Trump on points, while others said the most unexpected thing about the decision was that two Republican-nominated members of the court, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, joined the court's four more liberal justices on the majority opinion, which Justice Gorsuch wrote.
""As conservatives, they usually go by the rule of law, so I was surprised,"" said Wayne Bradley, 43, a Republican from Detroit. ""But I'm comfortable with the decision they made. Everyone deserves respect and with all the other things that are going on in the world, maybe that played a part in their decision. Everybody deserves protection.""
Margie Dougherty, 61, a Republican and Trump backer from Bayside in suburban Milwaukee, said she believed the president was not taking the right approach with his restrictions on transgender people serving in the military.
""If a person can perform the duties of a job or role they are hired and trained for, then they should be allowed to do the job,"" she said.
For many transgender and nonbinary Americans, however, changes in public opinion can be cold comfort given that prejudice and hate crimes remain a harsh reality in their lives. In interviews, some expressed concern that the new Supreme Court ruling could take the focus away from work that still needs to be done.
""The big picture is that employment is only one of many places where gay trans people are discriminated against,"" said Patrick Cognato, an English major at Binghamton University who is nonbinary. ""Things like health care, housing and education are really important, too, and have a serious effect on people's everyday lives. People can't wait for these to be addressed because it affects them every day.""
Last year, in a separate PRRI survey, 62 percent of Americans said that in recent years they had become more supportive of transgender rights, not less. Even a slim majority of white evangelicals - a Republican bastion - said they had grown more supportive.
But it was only five years ago that transgender Americans became a political target of Republicans trying to regulate the use of public bathrooms. Some political observers believe that the Republican focus on the issue backfired - particularly when a Democrat, Roy Cooper, won the governor's race in North Carolina after the state's ""bathroom bill"" became a flash point in the campaign. That legislation required transgender people in government and public buildings to use the bathroom that corresponds with the gender on their birth certificate.
The law drew nationwide outrage, prompting companies to cancel planned expansions and move events out of the state, costing North Carolina jobs and tax revenue. Last year, the law was partially repealed by a federal judge.
Whatever the change in attitudes, however, transgender Americans remain heavily targeted for hate crimes, violence and discrimination. Black transgender people suffer disproportionate levels of police violence, and the American Medical Association said last fall that killings of transgender people, especially women of color, amounted to an epidemic.
If some Republicans have grown more accepting of L.G.B.T.Q. rights, Mr. Trump, his administration and the party leadership appear out of step with those parts of the base.
While Mr. Trump said in 2016, while running for president, that transgender people should be allowed to use whatever bathroom they feel most comfortable with, he rescinded protections for transgender students in 2017 that had allowed them to use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity. In addition to the military ban, his administration moved last week to erase protections for transgender patients against discrimination by doctors, hospitals and health insurance companies.
""I cannot think of another administration that has gone out of its way to discriminate against transgender people specifically,"" said Gabriel Arkles, a senior staff lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union working on L.G.B.T.Q. rights. ""There are other administrations that were terrible for transgender people - the Reagan administration's management of the H.I.V. epidemic, Clinton's welfare and prison reform - but these weren't situations where they were specifically naming transgender people in their policies.""
On other issues, Mr. Trump called same-sex marriage ""settled law"" shortly after taking office, but he also promised to ""seriously consider"" a Supreme Court justice who would once again outlaw the constitutional right. Congressional Republicans and Mr. Trump continue to resist the Equality Act, Democratic-sponsored legislation that would extend anti-discrimination rules for L.G.B.T.Q. Americans. And the executive committee of the Republican National Committee decided this month to carry over the 2016 party platform, which calls for a constitutional amendment overturning the 2015 Supreme Court decision that struck down laws defining marriage between one man and one woman.
With the president's re-election prospects looking precarious at the moment, both Mr. Trump and some party leaders appear wary of antagonizing the loyal voters and activists in the most conservative parts of his base. Yet even some leaders on the right say that opposition to L.G.B.T.Q. protections doesn't carry the same political potency that it once did in some of the most conservative quarters of the party.
""Religious freedom and the protection of unborn lift ranks far higher in the hierarchy of the concerns from faith-based voters,"" said Ralph Reed, the chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, which works to drive evangelical voters to the polls.
On the campaign trail, most Republican elected officials now generally avoid broadcasting their opposition to same-sex marriage, except in select primary campaigns in deeply conservative districts. Meanwhile, a record number of L.G.B.T.Q. candidates won seats in the 2018 midterms, with 161 openly lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people elected, according to the Victory Fund, a nonpartisan political action committee devoted to electing L.G.B.T.Q. candidates. Most were Democrats.
Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster, said that what was once a hot-button issue for voters on the right had turned into something of a nonstarter.
""There was a period of concern over where things were moving on gay marriage: that a church that refused to marry a gay couple could be sued,"" Mr. Goeas said in an interview. ""The fact of the matter is, nothing's really pushed it to that extent, everything's sort of settled down into normalcy, and I don't sense that it's a big issue today.""
Even as national attitudes have evolved on questions around gender and sexuality, analysts said that the Republican Party under Mr. Trump has hardly let go of cultural issues altogether. It has simply shifted toward talking more about immigration and race, including in his attacks on protesters, immigrants and black celebrities.
""The new culture war is not abortion or same-sex marriage, the new culture war is about preserving a white, Christian America,"" said Dr. Jones, the PRRI pollster. A 2019 poll from his organization found that, even as many Americans' views on race had moved to the left in recent years, 69 percent of Republicans said they believed that discrimination against white people was just as much of a problem as discrimination against racial minorities.
""That's what Trump's really leading with,"" Dr. Jones added. ""The 'Make America Great Again' thing - the way that was heard by most white evangelical Protestants, white working-class folks, was saying: 'I'm going to preserve the composition of the country.'""

Global markets this morning have a firmer tone. Take a look at European indices this morning, green across the board. The FT 100 is up 34. The CAC quarante in Paris is up 70, and the DAX Index in Germany higher by 245 points right now, that's almost 2 percent.
EU leaders agreeing on a historic $2 trillion spending package to help the Eurozone recover from the economic impact of the coronavirus. The deal still needs to be approved by the individual governments of member states, but markets are certainly reacting to it.
In Asia overnight, the EU spending package and positive news on coronavirus vaccine trials led to gains across the board there as well. Take a look. Best performer was in Hong Kong, Hang Seng Index up two-and-a-third percent.
Now, some of the top stories that we are watching this morning. Top Democrats ready to meet with the White House officials today to discuss the latest round of a COVID-19 stimulus relief package. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer due to sit down with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows today.
Yesterday, top Republicans met with President Trump in the Oval Office to discuss their details of a $1 trillion proposal. That includes more than $70 billion to help schools. The very latest round of talks coming as the number of new U.S. COVID cases climbs at a slowest rate in a week, that is up by more than of 60,000 cases.
Overnight in Europe, EU leaders reach an agreement on a $2 trillion spending plan in coronavirus recovery fund after four days of heated talks in Europe.
Promising news this morning for a possible coronavirus vaccine. A partnership between Oxford University and AstraZeneca producing a strong immune response in the early stages of human trials. Researchers say that the vaccine triggered two immune responses by producing antibodies and increasing T-cells, which attack infected cells. AstraZeneca shares this morning are up slightly. Take a look. It's up about 1 percent. Next hour, we will speak with a doctor who will break down these results, coming up.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy hoping to clamp down on foreign hackers looking to steal U.S. vaccine research. Today he will introduce the Defend COVID Research from Hackers Act, which would reportedly give President Trump the ability to sanction any foreign person engaging in activity that threatens cyber health or national security.
China, Russia, and Iran have been accused of trying to steal vaccine- related information. It tells us a group of senators led by Arizona Senator Martha McSally released the Civil Justice for Victims of COVID Act yesterday. That allows China to be sued for its role in the pandemic.
Southern grocery store chain Winn-Dixie is reversing its no-face-mask policy. Customers will now be required to wear coverings starting on July 27.

Joining me right now is Yardeni Research President, Ed Yardeni. Also joining the conversation this morning is Fox Business's Dagen McDowell; The Wall Street Journal Senior Writer Jon Hilsenrath; and PwC Partner Mitch Roschelle.
Great to see everybody this morning. Thank you so much for being here this Tuesday morning.
And Ed, let me start it off with you. We've seen these spikes, and there have certainly been new worries sparked about a slowdown in the economic recovery. What's your take, second half of the year, in terms of growth - getting back to growth?
ED YARDENI, YARDENI RESEARCH PRESIDENT: Well, I think we've seen a V-shaped recovery in some areas of the economy like retail sales extraordinarily are basically back to where they were before this great virus crisis started. But a lot of that was fueled by a tremendous amount of government stimulus. The government sent everyone checks - almost everyone checks - sent - provided $600 a week in extra unemployment benefits, and all this added up to a tremendous boost to personal income, but more than offset the drop in wages related to unemployment.
So it's stimulus that's really giving us this V-shaped recovery. But it's not going to last without continuing stimulus. And apparently, they're already thinking about - talking about, as you said, more stimulus. And the Europeans have got stimulus. So a trillion here, a trillion there adds up to some serious money.
BARTIROMO: So, in other words, you do feel that we need another stimulus package. Obviously, they're working on it this morning and yesterday in Washington. Without that, you're not expecting a comeback to be sustained?
YARDENI: Well, yes. I think, clearly, if we see an elimination at the end of this month, the $600 per week, people aren't going to get another check. It's going to all be up to employment recovering.
And the problem with that, of course, is the case count has gone up. It is slowing, but it's still, as you said, 60,000. So the case count going up has cost some governors to slow down on opening up their economies. And that's the issue. We are seeing some of the daily and weekly indicators of the economy starting to stall right now. So that's where we are.
BARTIROMO: Wow! What about earning season, Ed? This morning we're standing by for Dow components Coca-Cola, the quarterly results. We'll also get Lockheed Morris, Philip Morris, Snap and United Airlines, other big names reporting their quarterly earnings. Anything - any takeaways from your standpoint from this second quarter earnings season so for?
YARDENI: No real surprises. I mean, the drop in earnings maybe a few months ago would have been surprisingly bad. But they're certainly shockingly bad. They're not surprisingly bad. They're down 40 percent on a year-over-year basis during the second quarter. That's pretty bad clearly.
And then we're going to see year-over-year declines in the third and the fourth quarters, but less so. The market clearly is looking beyond that to a recovery pattern. We are, in fact, seeing analysts starting to become less pessimistic about the outlook for earnings this year and next year.
And I think a lot of that has to do with the perception that the economy is opening up despite some of the outbreaks that we've seen and a perception that we're going to get more stimulus, and lo-and-behold, maybe we'll even get a vaccine, as you reported.
BARTIROMO: Yes, which would be great. IBM is up this morning on an earnings speed, but really when you look at tech overall, that has been where the money has been.
YARDENI: Right.
BARTIROMO: You've recently said that stocks are overvalued and could face a shock if coronavirus cases continue to rise. Tell me about that. How significant are you looking at this over-valuation and where specifically is it?
YARDENI: Right. Well, valuation really is a matter of opinion. There's no science to it. Historically, the average forward PE based on analysts' expectations for earnings has been around 15 to 18 for the S&P 500. Now we're at 22 going on 23. And this has all been led by these tech - magnificent six tech stocks. And their valuation multiple is around 40 and going maybe to 50.
So, historically speaking, the market is overvalued, led by these handful of tech companies and looks like it's not stopping. Money continues to pour there, and some of them are rightly so because they benefit from doing business over the Internet, and we're all spending more time working on the Internet, getting educated on the Internet, and having our entertainment on the Internet. But they're not cheap.
BARTIROMO: Yes. They're not cheap. And I wonder if that 40 goes to 50 or goes down to 30. Let me get Jon Hilsenrath in here. Go ahead, Jon.
JON HILSENRATH, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL SENIOR WRITER: Well, I want to hear what Ed has to say about the global stock outlook. The U.S. has really led the charge over the last few years. In particular, there's tech stocks that you're talking about. International stocks haven't been a great place to be for U.S. investors. Is that changing, Ed, and if so, where? I know you've spent a lot of time over the years looking at the Chinese stock market. Where is the value overseas? And more importantly, where's the growth overseas?
YARDENI: Jon, the value is almost everywhere else but here. But here the problem is over-valuation or the high valuation, the elevated valuation of just a handful of tech companies. You take them out, and you've got a multiple. It's more like 18 - I mean, the - the so-called value stocks are selling around 17, 18. The rest of the world is selling also kind of like a value stock of around 17, 18.
So the thing that is interesting to me is it looks from a health perspective that the rest of the world, particularly Europe and some countries in Asia are doing a much better job of opening up their economy and containing the virus. We're not doing as good a job. And from that perspective, it might be worthwhile looking for opportunities overseas also from a relative valuation perspective.
BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Ed, it's always a pleasure to see you, sir. Thanks so much.
YARDENI: Thank you.
BARTIROMO: Ed Yardeni joining us there.

All coming up right after this. Stay with us.
BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Democrats will be meeting with White House officials today about their version of the new COVID-19 stimulus relief package. This comes today after Republican leaders met with the President yesterday over their proposal, which will see over $70 billion going to schools.
Joining me right now is Fox News Contributor Deneen Borelli.
Deneen, it's good to see you this morning. Welcome back. Thanks so much for being here. What's your fake on this new bill?
DENEEN BORELLI, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning.
BARTIROMO: And what are you expecting will eventually be in it?
BORELLI: Well, I expect the tax cuts to be in it. And when you think about it, Maria, tax cuts are the best way to stimulate the economy. This puts more disposable income in the hands of Americans who know the best way how to spend this money. Consumer spending is 70 percent of our economy. So it's not only that aspect but it's also the fact that it's an incentive for businesses to hire and to stimulate job growth. So tax cuts, I think, is a really great idea and is going to help the country economically.
When you think about what the President did prior to the pandemic with the rollback in taxes, the regulations, we had record low unemployment, wage growth, more jobs and people to fill them. So I think they're going in the right direction with this.
BARTIROMO: Yes. Meanwhile you've got all of this unrest all across the country. We haven't really heard from Joe Biden on this. Yesterday he said he has four black women on his shortlist to become vice president. He would not give a guarantee that he will have a black woman as vice president.
What are your thoughts on where we are, Deneen? We are waiting to see who his partner in this race is while the incredible unrest across the country is warranting some kind of a response.
BORELLI: Yes. It was shame on Joe Biden for not responding to the unrest that we're seeing going across our country. But as a member with black voices for Trump, Maria, we have exposed Joe Biden as a fraud. He is not only a serial plagiarist but he supported segregation as early on in his career in the Senate. They helped him get ahead in his career. So Joe Biden will do and say anything to be elected President of the United States.
So now what he is doing is pandering to black voters by saying he's got four black women or so on his list that he's going to suggest for VP. Well, so what? What about content of character? What about the person's ability to do the job, the task at hand? He is just pandering to black voters because he's desperate for black voters' support.
BARTIROMO: Deneen, how is the black support for President Trump in your view? I think before this pandemic, it was clear that the unemployment situation had gotten so much better under President Trump. And yet now here we are with a double-digit unemployment rate again. What's your take on the African-American community and its support for this President going into the election?
BORELLI: Sure. I think black voters will definitely take a good look at what is going on, the dynamics between President Trump and Former Vice President Joe Biden. President Trump wants law and order across the country. And you have these Democrat-run cities who are just in utter chaos and they are not stemming the violence and destruction that is going on. They're letting them run wild. President Trump wants law and order. He is also--
BARTIROMO: Yes.
BORELLI: --concerned about economic security for all Americans and especially in black communities, which is why they have the opportunity zones which is helping disadvantaged neighborhoods to provide that help jobs and lower taxes, regulations and other opportunities for black Americans. So they are certainly taking a good look at President Trump and his agenda of the America-first agenda.
BARTIROMO: All right, Deneen. Great to talk with you this morning. Thanks so much. We'll keep watching. Deneen Borelli there. Stay with us. We'll be right back.
BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The future of American cities at stake. A new study finds some Wall Street firms are considering cutting their presence in New York City by 20 percent. The report also finds one in four employers are planning on reducing their footprint in the city.
Jon Hilsenrath wrote the story about state of cities in a ""Wall Street Journal"" piece this week. Jon wrote this. ""Extended lockdowns have drained cities of their energy, charm and financial promise that drew so many in the first place, and underlined the weaknesses, inconveniences and risks. With remote technology facilitating work from home for many, some New Yorkers have already decamped to the suburbs.""
Jon Hilsenrath, great piece in the journal. Tell us more about it.
HILSENRATH: Well, American cities have been through something like a 30- year renaissance. Maria, you know as well as anyone what New York was like in the late 1980s. One of the big issues that turned New York and other cities around was that crime fell so much and people felt safer being there. And New York is - and many other cities are being hit right now by two safety shocks. One is an increase in crime. In particular, I should say, an increase in violent crime, murder. Robberies are down across many cities. And then the other is the coronavirus pandemic.
So American cities after having a boom really for the last 30 years are going through their biggest test in a long time. And I should say, the other thing that was really going for cities for a long time with this tech boom, it was drawing workers, skilled educated workers into metropolitan areas. And now the question is whether technology is going to draw people out by having more people working remotely.
BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, are you seeing plans being changed right now given the fact that we are now worried about a second spike? We are worried that it's not going to happen overnight in terms of getting back to normalization. Our executives changing their plans right now in terms of shutting down offices in New York or moving their employees around in different places or leaving them at home?
HILSENRATH: Yes. Well, what I see is not complete abandonment. When you talk to the big financial firms, they're not talking about leaving New York altogether. But they are talking about reducing their footprints. Moody's, for example, is in my story. They're scaling back two floors. They're finding that they can have more people working remotely, and they don't need as much floor space in the process that solves a couple of problems for them. What is it? Cut costs.
But - excuse me - the other thing is that it cuts down on how many - how much people have to commute. And that's a real safety concern for a lot of people. The other thing I think we have to look at is what's happening in crime. It's a complex issue. As I said, violent crime--
DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS: It's not complicated.
HILSENRATH: --is up across cities. All of--
(CROSSTALK)
MCDOWELL: You know what? It's not complicated. The crime issue--
HILSENRATH: Dagen--
MCDOWELL: --is not complicated. This is not blameless. New York City is a hellhole because of the left-wing lunatics running this city that it has become a violent downward spiral.
HILSENRATH: Dagen, I've got to challenge you - I have to challenge you on - Dagen, I have to challenge you on that because if you look--
MCDOWELL: I - wait. Can I speak? Can I speak? Because I can go through what is going on since - since New York was America's safest big city in 2014 when Bill de Blasio was sworn in as the Mayor. It started with quality of life offenses.
The City Council said, oh, let's relax enforcement of vagrancy, public urination, public defecation. Cy Vance, the Manhattan D.A., stopped prosecuting those very crimes. Bail reform this year. If you get arrested for manslaughter, arson, hate crimes, aggravated assault of a child, you don't have to put up bail. You get right out. The plainclothes anti-crime unit was recently disbanded because of political pressure.
And what is also going on is because the budgets have skyrocketed, taxes will keep going up. People don't want to live here because it's not safe and they're paying more in taxes for nothing. But also what's happening is, the landlords are actually raising the rents now on the people who are stuck here, who can't leave, not 2 percent a year, but 10 percent, 15 percent a year. No one will stand by--
BARTIROMO: Wow!
MCDOWELL: --and tolerate that.
HILSENRATH: All right. So I just want to make - I want to make one point. I'm not going to - I'm not going to defend what's--
(CROSSTALK)
BARTIROMO: Jon, you got the last (inaudible). Go ahead.
HILSENRATH: I'm not going to defend what's happening in New York. But I will tell you this. Murder is rising in cities all across the country, including Republican-run cities such as Miami, such as San Diego, such as Tulsa. So I'm not going to sit here and tell you that New York is a sunny, rosy place. But this issue is being politicized by a lot of people, and the fact is that murder is rising in many places and robbery is still falling. So we just have to look at the facts. And those are the facts, Dagen.
MCDOWELL: Miami has a Democratic mayor, does it not?
BARTIROMO: Is it the same extent?
HILSENRATH: No.
MCDOWELL: Doesn't Miami have a Democratic mayor?
HILSENRATH: No. Look it up. Two Republicans.
MCDOWELL: Miami Beach? Miami Beach? They don't have a Democrat?
HILSENRATH: Listen. Listen. My only point is, it's happening in many places. And it's - I just don't - I think you have to be careful about politicizing it because - again, San Diego - and I'm not pointing my fingers at those places. I'm saying there are a lot of things going on, and you have to look across the broad spectrum to really get to the bottom of it.
I'm not going to say New York is a great run place. I understand people have all kinds of concerns about New York. But if you just make it about politics, you could be missing something. That's all I'm saying.
MARIA BARTIROMO, ANCHOR, MORNINGS WITH MARIA: Well, but the policies, the policies have made things worse in those cities. Isn't that right? The policies --
HILSENRATH: Right, I'm not -- I'm not going to argue against that --
BARTIROMO: The sanctuary cities, for example.
HILSENRATH: Well, it's also --
BARTIROMO: Yes --
HILSENRATH: The case that crime has fell for 30 years, and was falling right up until the last few years --
DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS: You're right, you're right --
HILSENRATH: So --
MCDOWELL: Suarez is a Republican, but --
BARTIROMO: All right --
MCDOWELL: I believe the mayor of Miami Beach is a Democrat.
HILSENRATH: These are -- Dagen, these are my --
BARTIROMO: All right --
HILSENRATH: This is the city of Miami that I'm talking about --
BARTIROMO: OK --
HILSENRATH: And listen, I'm not pointing my finger at those places, all I'm saying is, there are a lot of things going on --
BARTIROMO: Yes --
HILSENRATH: Let's look at --
BARTIROMO: I understand --
HILSENRATH: All of them and not just point to what they think --
BARTIROMO: This is -- well, we're all trying to understand, we're all trying to understand why this is happening, and this is the conversation taking place across the country. We'll be right back, stay with us.
BARTIROMO: Well, welcome back to Tuesday morning everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, July 21st. Take a look at markets here, 6:34 a.m. on the East Coast. We're looking at a firmer tone this morning, encouraging news from three coronavirus vaccines trials, helping fuel markets this morning, futures pointing to a higher opening.
The Nasdaq is on fire, it is once again in record territory. It is up 93 points, the Dow Industrials right now up 176, and the S&P futures right now up 23.5 points. We're going see a rally right out of the gates this morning after a big strong rally in technology stocks yesterday, that helped pushed the Nasdaq to another record close.
The Dow, the S&P 500 also finishing in the green yesterday at 4:00. But look at the Nasdaq up 263 points at the close yesterday, 2.5 percent. Global markets this morning are also high, European indices higher across the board. We do have news from EU leaders agreeing on a historic $2 trillion spending package to help the Eurozone recover from the economic impact of the coronavirus.
The deal still needs to be approved by the individual governments of member states, the FTSE 100 up 36, the CAC Quarante up 63, the Dax Index up 231. In Asia overnight, that EU spending package and positive news on the coronavirus vaccine trials also leaning to gains across the board, best performer was in Hong Kong, Hang Seng index up, 2.3 percent. IBM is looking to the cloud to grow its business despite uncertainty from COVID-19 pandemic, good numbers last night on earnings, Jackie DeAngelis with the details. Jackie.
JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS: Good morning to you, Maria, that's right. IBM's latest results fell from a year ago, but they still beat the street's forecast. Cloud computing revenue jumped 30 percent to $6.3 billion and IBM CEO Arvind Krishna telling analysts that the economic recovery is looking to be a little longer and more protracted than we might have hoped for back in March. Checking on shares of IBM in the pre-market this morning, they are up more than 5 percent.
And Elon Musk is now the fifth richest person in the world. Just four months ago, Musk was ranked 31st on the ""Forbes"" billionaire list with a net worth of under $25 billion, but now the magazine estimates that his net worth has tripled to more than $74 billion. He can thank the soaring stock price for Tesla and also rising evaluation for Space X as well. And here's a look at what's trending this morning on foxbusiness.com.
Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, her trial may be delayed again due to the pandemic. Holmes' trial was postponed until October and now may be pushed until 2021. United Airlines average occupancy rate is expected to fall about 45 percent this month as the airline limits the number of passengers to curb the spread of coronavirus. And Ulta Beauty slowing down its store reopening plan as coronavirus cases spike in the United States. The company now expects to open around 30 store this year, Maria?
BARTIROMO: All right, Jackie, thank you. We'll keep checking back, Jackie DeAngelis. The battle for 5G is on. China reportedly weighing retaliation against European telecom firms Nokia and Ericsson. Should EU countries move to ban Huawei from its 5G network. This comes as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo meets with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson today, just a week after London sided with the United States in banning Huawei Technology in its 5G networks.
Joining me right now is Fox News senior strategic analyst, retired General Jack Keane. General, it's always a pleasure, thanks very much for joining us. Well, things are heating up around 5G, what's your take on this push- back from China? U.K. already banned Huawei. Tell us the security risks around this?
JACK KEANE, FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST: Well, I think what's happening here is somewhat predictable. I mean, that China -- if you push them, they're going to lash back out at you. And listen, we pulled the scab off of the wound when it comes to China's force, and every country in the world to reassess their strategic relationship with China. And it's also forcing businesses to relook as well.
Maria, in terms of this relationship, because while certainly the profits have been there, operating inside of China, the reality is -- there's a perception that that's a free capitalistic society, but the truth is, it's a controlled capitalistic society and controlled by the Chinese Communist Party which means things could turn around overnight geopolitically and your company can be in serious trouble. And that's the reassessment that has to take place in terms of short-term gains versus long-term gains.
BARTIROMO: General, there's a conversation taking place right now in government about whether or not the United States should be backing an alternative to Huawei, and that would mean Nokia and Ericsson. There was a Senate hearing where the idea was raised for the U.S. government to take stakes, a minority stake in either Nokia and Ericsson to show the world smaller countries which China is trying to bully to use their network, Huawei.
Look, you have an alternative, and it's backed by the United States. Do you think that the U.S. should go this way or -- and what about Huawei trying to -- trying to get back at Nokia and Ericsson in some way. What could they do?
KEANE: Well, I don't think the United States should get involved in what businesses we want to back. I think the United States is doing the appropriate thing in making certain that Huawei who we know is an arm of the Chinese Communist government is not dominating our telecom industry as we move towards 5G. And certainly, talking to our allies about doing the very same thing because we are connected to our allies in terms of intelligent-sharing.
And that I think is the number one reason why the U.K. reversed their position on Huawei because there's no other country in the world where we have more shared intelligence with than the United Kingdom. And we would have to walk away from that relationship which would be detrimental to both countries. And so, we're trying to convince the Europeans of the same --
BARTIROMO: What --
KEANE: Thing, and I don't believe the Europeans are going to go the same route that the U.K. does.
BARTIROMO: I'd say, yes, because I mean, even after the -- overreach in Hong Kong, you saw a statement come out from the English-speaking allies of the United States, Australia, Canada, the U.K., you know, demanding information about this national security law, and pushing back at China. But you didn't hear a word from Spain, Italy, Germany, where are they in this and what do you think the conversation will be today when the Secretary of State meets with the U.K. Prime Minister?
KEANE: Well, I just think that there are so many -- have a lot on the plate when it comes to the Chinese Communist Party. But they also have a lot on the plate dealing with the Russian threat and Russian meddling in elections. So there's a lot of issues there for them. But the come-back to the Europeans -- and I mean, we've been challenged by the Europeans before over the predatory nature of Iran dominating the Middle East and the Europeans willing to continue to do business with them.
Despite their predatory nature, they haven't been as strong on Russia, although they've been stronger on Russia than they have been on Iran, but not as strong as we would like them to be. And certainly here with the Chinese Communist Party, I think they're going to try to find some middle ground, which is what they normally do. They don't show the strong leadership willingness to stand up to the predatory nature of China the way the United States is doing right now.
It's going to take some work -- and I suspect, you know, China will push them towards us because of their predatory nature. And --
BARTIROMO: Yes --
KEANE: How ambitious President Xi is, and how aggressive he is, and how he doesn't care about his malign behavior. Look at what we have seen. We've watched him destroy --
BARTIROMO: Yes --
KEANE: A free capitalist society in Hong Kong, 27 years before the treaty was supposed to --
BARTIROMO: Right --
KEANE: Be over right in full view of the entire world. What a lesson that is for all of us who are looking at the Communist Chinese Party --
BARTIROMO: Yes --
KEANE: When our relationship should be going forward.
BARTIROMO: What about the Trump administration barring these 11 Chinese companies from purchasing American technology without a special license. Breaking overnight, saying that the firms were complicit in human rights violations against Uyghur Muslims.
KEANE: Yes, and was not aware of that. Totally in agreement with it. I think -- from what I've been told by President Trump's economic adviser, they have a very long list of things that they'll be executing, dealing with what's taking place with the Chinese Communist Party and businesses. And some of that has to do with the -- you know, the listing on the Stock Exchange by Chinese companies, but not abiding by SEC rules or not abiding by public accounting procedures as well. So, I think --
BARTIROMO: Yes --
KEANE: Comprehensively, this administration is looking at the Chinese Communist Party economically, financially, geopolitically and militarily. And it's a whole of government approach, something we've not seen before. And the good news is, it's a huge strategic opportunity, Maria, to stitch together a plan with our partners and allies as well.
BARTIROMO: Yes, you're right, and you look at our allies, India banning TikTok and 58 other apps. You know, you've got Hong Kong and many of our allies pushing back on that. The U.K. banning Huawei in its 5G, so you are seeing an agreement here. Well, we'll see how any kind of a trade deal works out when we have a sort of new conversation and new outlook on China, that's for sure on the Communist Party. General, it's always great to get your insights on this. Thanks so much.
KEANE: Yes, good seeing you, Maria.
BARTIROMO: General Jack Keane, and to you, we'll be right back.
BARTIROMO: Welcome back, the fall of a giant since 1892. General Electric has been nearly synonymous with American innovation at its peak in August of 2000. GE was the most valuable company in the country worth nearly $600 billion. But it soon became a cautionary tale of what happens when conglomerates fail to adapt quickly when their success falters. Joining me right now is Ted Mann; he's a ""Wall Street Journal"" reporter who covered GE's fall and co-authored a new book titled ""Lights Out: Pride, Delusion And The Fall of General Electric"". Ted, it's great to have you this morning, thanks very much for joining us.
TED MANN, AUTHOR: Thanks for having me.
BARTIROMO: I worked at GE, literally for almost 20 years at ""CNBC"". I was at CNBC for 20 year, but for much of my time at ""CNBC"", GE was our parent company and we knew that GE was really supporting ""CNBC"". GE was a different company, I was there at its height in August 2000. Tell us Ted, what happened?
MANN: Well, it's a long story. There was a long multi-year effort to transform the conglomerate that Jack Welch had helped sort of grow and create. And over the years, the new leadership under Jeff Immelt were having to try to create a new model for this large entity and figure out how it needed to transform in the 21st century. And really in a period of around five years, late in Immelt's tenure, when he was trying to figure out exactly what was needed to shake the stock out of this long slump, he attempted a pivot.
He attempted to really break the company's reliance on financial services for its earnings. He attempted to gigantic industrial acquisition that was pretty much a failure. And in the process elsewhere in the company, they were losing site of some of the really key elements of the basics of the business, especially in the power division where the company simply was running out of cash in a way that investors didn't see until too late.
And that was a perfect storm that really combined to end Immelt's tenure and to shock, I think the entire investing world.
BARTIROMO: It really was, and he also wanted to un-jack GE, I mean, let's face it. He wanted to take Jack Welch's name off the Crontonville Leadership Center. You write in the book that he wanted to change the tagline, ""we bring good things to life"", which was in place since 1890. Was it a mistake to make such harsh changes after Jack built the place, he wants to un-jack GE.
MANN: Well, I think that's complicated. The corporation that he inherited in -- he being Immelt, was already not going to be sustainable in the specific structure it held when Welch turned it over as Immelt's defenders will point out, the stock was already falling when he took the job. Also, if you think about taking over in 2001, this was a company that was having to be remade to some extent for an era of globalization.
Having to be rethought along those lines. But then certainly, there also was a desire by the new guy at the top over many years to remake parts of the company in his own strategic vision, and not simply to run what he had been given. So they would have said this is -- this number is several years old, they would have said that by late in his tenure, Immelt had sold about 65 percent of the portfolio that he had inherited from Welch, holding on to things like airplane engines and power turbines, but investing in different places than Welch had.
BARTIROMO: It's a great book and it's an important book because there was a time when you had GE stock you had money in the bank. Seniors held it and it's just no longer the case, it's a very important book to read. Ted, thank you so much for joining us. Ted Mann, stay with us --
MANN: Thanks very much --
BARTIROMO: We'll be right back.
BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Time for the Morning Buzz, first up, exercising without breaking a sweat? Researchers believe the effect of working out could come in pill form, yes, Dagen, you're a runner. What do you think about this, take a pill and you've exercised?
MCDOWELL: Expletive. I don't buy it. It's -- they're talking about a specific enzyme that's released from your liver when you exercise. If you want good brain health, it's about sleeping. So, if that's in a pill form, it's called Ambien, and it will help you get a good night rest.
BARTIROMO: Yes, good point. Next up, the coronavirus hitting the entertainment industry, the paparazzi can't get the right shot, celebrity photographers are having a hard time spotting stars. Companies are turning down celebrity photos since those spotted are usually in masks, keeping a low profile. This is hurting a whole another industry that we don't talk about, Mitch.
MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER: Yes, I don't have a lot of sympathy for paparazzi honestly, and their go-to spot which is baggage claim at LAX, they can't go there because nobody is flying. But the one thing about masks, be careful what you say online at supermarkets because you have no idea who is standing next to you, and you don't want to be talking about somebody when they're standing right next to you.
BARTIROMO: Yes, that's right, very good advice. All right, finally, the doctor plays ball too. Dr. Anthony Fauci will be throwing out the first pitch this Thursday at the Washington Nationals season opener. Jon, are you ready?
HILSENRATH: Yes, you know, I'd like to say two things about this. One is, I'm looking forward to my Yankees beating up on Dr. Fauci's Nationals. The other thing is, you know, stuff gets so politicized these days, I think the doctor ought to stick to the pandemic until it's over and then throws pitches later on.
BARTIROMO: Yes, all I have to say is when I threw out the first pitch at Yankees stadium right before the playoffs, it was the most exciting day of my life. I practiced a lot and guess what? I got it right over the plate, there you go. Let's see how Anthony Fauci does. We'll take a break, when we come back, stay tuned for more MORNINGS WITH MARIA, next hour, we are live on Fox Business this morning, back in a minute."

James Murdoch has revealed he doesn't watch Succession, the TV show inspired by his family, and only 'sometimes' tunes into Fox News after quitting his father's media empire. 
The youngest son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch spoke with The New York Times from his farm in Connecticut, where he keep chickens and sheep, to explain why he left the organization in July. 
James, 47, told the paper he quit his father's media empire because it was 'legitimizing disinformation' and slammed 'crazy' Trump for 'infecting the US with cruelty' and downplaying COVID-19. 
When asked if he watched Fox News James replied: 'Sometimes I watch, if there's an important thing, like an important interview or something like that, sometimes.'
Probed on why he does not watch HBO drama Succession, the Emmy award winner said to be modeled on his family dynamics, he added: 'I think you'd find it really easy. The other thing is, the dramatization of family affairs is as old as anything. It's always built in a certain construct, back in Shakespeare or back in Homer.
'I think the reality, my reality anyways, is that I've never felt that comfortable drawing any parallels, because I don't feel as if I live solely in a needy orbit of approval or whatever from the charismatic mega-fauna. Not at all. I'm entirely my own person.' 
James and his second wife Anna told the New York Times about his decision to break free from the family business, saying he 'pulled the rip cord' at the end of July because he was 'increasingly uncomfortable' with News Corp and Fox 'legitimizing disinformation' and denying climate change.
In a major departure from his father's Fox business which has long been an ally of the president, Murdoch also blasted Trump's 'craziness' for denying the dangers of the pandemic and said 'it's no coincidence the number of hate crimes in this country are rising' since he entered the White House. 
News Corp is one of the two major media conglomerates owned by the Murdoch family, the other being Fox Corporation, which was established after The Walt Disney Company acquired the majority of 21st Century Fox last year. 
Murdoch told the Times it was 'not that hard a decision' to stand down from News Corp because of major disagreements with his father and brother Lachlan over the running of the business.
He accused the news organization of 'hid[ing] agendas', 'sow[ing] doubt' and 'obscur[ing] fact' to its audience at a time when Trump has blasted other outlets for spreading so-called fake news while often heaping praise on conservative outlet Fox. 
'I reached the conclusion that you can venerate a contest of ideas, if you will, and we all do and that's important,' he told the Times. 
'But it shouldn't be in a way that hides agendas. A contest of ideas shouldn't be used to legitimize disinformation. 
'And I think it's often taken advantage of. And I think at great news organizations, the mission really should be to introduce fact to disperse doubt - not to sow doubt, to obscure fact, if you will.' 
Murdoch said he became 'increasingly uncomfortable' with the inner workings at the company and so 'pulled the rip cord.' 
'I just felt increasingly uncomfortable with my position on the board having some disagreements over how certain decisions are being made,' he said. 
'So it was actually not that hard a decision to remove myself and have a kind of cleaner slate.' 
Murdoch said he felt he couldn't change the company from the inside and so no longer wanted to be associated with it.
'I think there's only so much you can do if you're not an executive, you're on the board, you're quite removed from a lot of the day-to-day decisions, obviously,' he said. 
'And if you're uncomfortable with those decisions, you have to take stock of whether or not you want to be associated and can you change it or not. 
'I decided that I could be much more effective outside.' 
He added that he had 'been arguing about politics since I was a teenager' with his father. 
Murdoch told the Times his new ventures include investing in start-ups created to combat fake news and the spread of disinformation.
He said fake news was 'terrifying' because it 'undermine our ability to discern what's true and what's not' and said the spread of disinformation 'is only at the beginning as far as I can tell.' 
 THE MURDOCH FAMILY MEDIA EMPIRE 
RUPERT MURDOCH, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF NEWS CORP 
The Australian-born mogul began building his media empire in Australia by acquiring numerous publications in the 1950s, before entering the British newspaper market in 1969, and expanding to the US in 1974. 
He founded News Corporation in 1980, which quickly evolved into one of the largest media groups in the world owning assets in print, news, and television.
In 2013, News Corporation split into two sister companies, News Corp and 21st Century Fox. The latter was later rebranded as Fox Corporation after the majority of its assets were sold to The Walt Disney Company in 2019. 
Murdoch currently serves as the executive chairman of News Corp and the chairman of Fox Corporation. He is estimated to be worth $17billion. 
LACHLAN MURDOCH, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN AND CEO OF FOX CORPORATION, CO-CHAIR OF NEWS CORP
Lachlan Murdoch, 48, the eldest of the Murdoch children, is the heir apparent to News Corp Executive Chairman Rupert and is co-chairman of News Corp. He was named executive chairman and CEO of Fox Corp in 2019, after 21st Century Fox was sold to Disney. 
Before the sale, younger brother James had been the CEO of the company and Lachlan was executive chairman. Lachlan is also chairman of Australian entertainment company NOVA Entertainment, which operates a number of radio stations across the country.
JAMES MURDOCH, FORMER BOARD MEMBER OF NEWS CORP
The younger son of Rupert Murdoch, James, 47, had been on the board of News Corp since 2013. He and brother Lachlan had shared power at 21st Century Fox, but the sale of much of the Fox entertainment business to Disney in 2019 saw James depart as CEO. 
Since then, he has worked at the helm of investment fund Lupa Systems. 
James is considered more liberal than his older brother who is CEO of Fox Corp, home to conservative news network Fox News, the Fox broadcast and sports networks and local TV stations. 
James has been critical of News Corp's editorial decisions and has said he disagreed with Fox News coverage. He resigned from the board on July 31, 2020.
PRUDENCE MURDOCH, NON-EXECUTIVE BOARD MEMBER OF NEWS CORP
Prudence Murdoch, 62, is the eldest child of Rupert Murdoch through his first marriage with Patricia Booker. 
She formerly worked as journalist for now-defunct British tabloid, News of the World, which was owned by her father.
Prudence was once described in the media as the 'only one of [Murdoch's] children not directly competing for his business affections.'
ELISABETH MURDOCH, MEDIA EXECUTIVE AND FORMER CHAIRPERSON OF SHINE GROUP
Elisabeth is Rupert Murdoch's daughter from his second marriage with Anna Maria Torv. Born in Sydney, she moved to London in 1990s where she worked on the operations side of BSkyB, ran by her father. 
She founded UK-based TV programming company Shine Limited in 2001, which was sold to News Corp ten years later. 
She currently serves as executive chairman of production company Sister.
GRACE AND CHLOE MURDOCH
The sisters, aged 19 and 17, are Rupert's daughters from his third marriage to Wendi Deng.
He is also funding a research program to study how society is being manipulated by technology including through the use of mass surveillance and 5G. 
As well as spreading 'disinformation' Murdoch revealed other major disagreements including his father's unwillingness to replace Roger Ailes with former CBS News president David Rhodes in 2016, after Ailes faced multiple accusations of sexual harassment at Fox. 
The Harvard dropout also cited the vast differences in opinion around climate change. 
Murdoch, who announced he would make Sky carbon neutral in 2006, told the Times climate change is 'a crisis'. 
'Climate is also a public health crisis,' he said when asked about coronavirus. 
His wife Kathryn also told the Times she was shocked that some people and organizations - including her husband's family's business - are still denying its existence in 2020. 
'I never thought that we would actually be at the point where we would have climate change effects and people would still be denying it,' she said. 
The couple have long championed sustainability but the disparities with News Corp really came to a head in January when they said they were 'frustrated' when Fox peddled a theory that climate change was not to blame for the Australian wildfires that destroyed more than 46 million acres nationwide. 
Murdoch also sought to dispel rumors that he had wanted to take over the helm at Disney after pushing for News Corp to reach a deal with the entertainment giant. 
'I decided pretty soon after we closed it that I didn't want to stay on in the business,' he said.
He added: 'We never really even took talks very far at all about going to Disney because I informed them, because they were really trying to figure, 'OK, what does the structure look like? Et cetera.' I called Bob [Iger] and said, 'Look, you need to design that without me.''
Murdoch went on to slam Trump calling his administration 'dangerous' and blaming him for a spike in hate crime across America. 
'I'm just concerned that the leadership that we have, to me, just seems characterized by callousness and a level of cruelty that I think is really dangerous and then it infects the population,' he said. 
'It's not a coincidence that the number of hate crimes in this country are rising over the last three years for the first time in a long time.' 
He blasted Trump's handling of coronavirus saying his likening of the virus to the flu 'from day 1' is 'craziness.' 
Trump has repeatedly downplayed the severity of the virus and refused to wear a mask for several months as cases soared nationwide and health experts urged Americans to wear face coverings to slow the spread.
The president tested positive for the virus last week and was hospitalized for four days and given experimental drugs for treatment after his condition deteriorated.
However, he has now left the hospital and returned to his stance downplaying the virus, telling people to 'not fear' the virus that has killed more than 200,000 Americans and claiming he is 'cured'. 
Murdoch also showed disapproval for Fox's very close relationship with the president.
When asked about Sean Hannity comparing Trump's actions during the pandemic to the leadership of President Roosevelt and his 'we have nothing to fear but fear itself' speech in 1933, he said 'it's a little much'. 
Murdoch threw his support behind Joe Biden saying 'hell yes' when asked if he will be voting for the Democratic candidate in November's election. 
He donated to Pete Buttigieg in the primary has given $1.23 million to Biden's campaign. 
James previously served as the CEO of 21st Century Fox but stepped down following the sale. 
Since then, he has worked at the helm of the investment fund Lupa Systems. 
Rupert Murdoch designed his companies to benefit his family, making certain that he and his children always had control. 
But the media tycoon has not left his children with a plan for the future of his media empire, refusing to officially name an heir despite making no secret of his preferred child - Lachlan. 
Lachlan, Murdoch's older son, is the 'golden child' according to multiple sources - not his oldest child Prudence or the next in line Elisabeth, who has found incredible success outside the family business in emerging media markets. 
James, who stood by his side for decades and weathered the fallout from the 2011 hacking scandal at News of the World and the 2016 sexual assault scandal at Fox News, is also not the firm favorite. 
The media mogul is the father of six children, who range in age from 61 to 16. 
News Corp also publishes major papers in Australia and the UK and owns the HarperCollins book publisher. "

We are constantly bombarded with mediated information from all sides, whether it is over television, radio, newspaper or social media. At the Daily Wildcat, we believe that an education and understanding of media literacy is as important to a functioning democracy as the information itself.
Although the act of reading a journalistic article should be a simple process that gives the reader clear facts and information on events, people, topics, etc., we don't live in a perfect world. It is on the individual consumer to have tools to filter truth and falsehoods in each piece of media viewed from any platform, whether it be newspapers and evening news broadcasts or social media and the internet.
Media literacy is the set of skills involved in the critical consumption of news and media by identifying where media comes from and what it is intended to do. Media literacy is what allows citizens of democracies to consume information from news outlets and understand what is going on in the world around them.
In order to turn media literacy from a buzzword into a real concept, it is important to understand the contexts in which you see media, where the media came from and what underlying message the information in a media source is conveying.

Democracy hinges on its citizens and their ability to be media literate. In other words, the only way a democracy can survive is if its citizens are filtering out false information. In society, people act on information, and the most basic duty of living in a democracy - voting - is useless without factual information.
The spread of false information can also cause real physical harm. False information about racial groups and religions can cause hate crimes according to the United Nations. During the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, this danger has been clear with anti-Asian hate crime occurring due to false information spread online. While words can be revised, actions cannot, especially those driven by the hate and malice that false information can provoke.
Many instances of disinformation proliferating social media have become relevant just this year. An example is the conspiracy theory that the online furniture store Wayfair was selling very expensive furniture labelled with names of missing children as a part of an elaborate child sex-trafficking scheme, which was not true. Unfortunately, despite absolutely no evidence to back this claim, you can see the spread and find the claims of this conspiracy on Twitter with a simple search.
This conspiracy theory is a small component of the growing terrorist group QAnon, which originated as an umbrella term for fringe conspiracies from the website 4chan. The fundamental agreement of QAnon believers is that top U.S. Democrats and celebrities are all part of a child-sex trafficking, pedophilic, Satan-worshipping ring - including President-elect Joe Biden and his affiliates, celebrities like Oprah Winfrey and religious leaders like Pope Francis - while outgoing President Donald Trump is the chosen one to rid the country of these people through ""The Storm.""
According to The New York Times, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube have played essential roles in the spread of the online conspiracy. Violent acts and threats have been linked to the conspiracy, causing the current FBI director to classify the group as a domestic terrorist organization. Trump has done nothing but encourage the group, stating that they ""are people that love our country,"" and refusing to condemn them when asked to directly.
Trump has also done more than enable and encourage a domestic terrorist group. As of Nov. 16, he tweeted more than 300 false claims about the presidential election results, with more being flagged every day. Twitter has been flagging this flood of disinformation as ""disputed,"" but has left the Tweets visible. This not only allows the spread of disinformation that destroys the credibility of what was the most secure election in U.S. history, it enables his supporters to actively deny reality, reject the election results and encourages violence against election staff.
Since Trump's defeat, it has been reported that QAnon has ""gone dark,"" with no new posts from ""Q,"" along with a mixture of denial and an understanding of loss among supporters. This does not mean that QAnon is no longer a domestic terrorist group, it just means their largest enabler's platform has become a lot more restricted. This will not end the groups' beliefs or acts of violence.
QAnon and its massive following is only one example of how misinformation can infect a population by feeding people fear and lies in order to gain ground in popular media. The acts of violence encouraged by QAnon leaders and Trump pose a real, consequential threat to the functioning of our free elections in the U.S.
This spiral of false information, as aforementioned, is largely enabled by the failure of filtering on social media platforms. A March 2019 report showed 49% of U.S. adults unknowingly shared false information via social media.
The Daily Wildcat believes strongly in the importance of media literacy as media becomes increasingly influential in shaping our culture and beliefs, and, in turn, our public policy. Fake news - including doctored photos, online conspiracies and deep fakes - continues to infect our democracy with disinformation that drastically affects the outcome of policy, elections and the lives of every person under the jurisdiction of the U.S.
If media literacy continues to be neglected, false information not only threatens marginalized citizens and any people who oppose it, but also has the potential to undermine the idea of a free press, which is essential to a functioning democracy. The need for media literacy cannot be ignored. Radical change needs to happen in educating children on the media they consume, as well as working to gain trust of adults in trustworthy news organizations. This education must evolve with technology and media platforms.
Journalists work for the public. The public needs to carefully choose where their information comes from, while trusting journalists who work tirelessly to bring them information to use when voting for the future.

Macdonald’s statue in Montreal, they probably don’t want to be reminded that in neighbouring Ontario there stands another statue, one that has thus far escaped the wrath of Black and Indigenous Lives Matter activists.
Victoria Park in Brantford, Ontario features a grand statue commemorating the life of Mohawk leader Joseph Brant (Thayendanegea). To mark the statue’s unveiling in 1886, celebrated Indigenous Canadian poet E. Pauline Johnson wrote:
“Then meet we as one common brotherhood
In peace and love, with purpose understood
To lift a lasting tribute to the name
Of Brant, who linked his own with Britain’s fame.”
And in the same poem:
“Today the Six Red Nations have their Canada.
And rest we here, no cause for us to rise
To seek protection under other skies.
Encircling us an arm both true and brave
Extends from far across the great salt wave.
Tho’ but a woman’s arm, ’tis firm, and strong
Enough to guard us from all fear of wrong,
An arm on which all British subjects lean —
The loving hand of England’s noble Queen.”
By these words, we can presume Johnson clearly believed in the value of Brant’s legacy and the essential role of colonization for Canada’s future. 
Yet a year previous, in 1885, she wrote in “A Cry From an Indian Wife”: 
“Go forth, nor bend to greed of white men’s hands,
By right, by birth we Indians own these lands,
Though starved, crushed, plundered, lies our nation low …
Perhaps the white man’s God has willed it so.””
The chronology of these writings leaves us bewildered about where Johnson really stood.
And today, we live in bewildering times indeed.
Memorials are being vandalized, torn down, or re-named all across our country, colonialism and colonists being named the villains. Among them: Queen Victoria, British Columbia chief judge Sir Matthew Baillie Begbie, Egerton Ryerson, James McGill, Hector-Louis Langevin, Samuel Champlain, Sir John A. Macdonald, Edward Cornwallis, Sir Garnet Wolseley, Henry Dundas, to name a few. These historical figures are today either condemned, or are about to be, by the desecration of their memorials or the renaming of streets, parks, bridges, buildings, and universities.
All the while, there is little or no criticism of Liberal Prime Minister Alexander Mackenzie and every other prime minister after him – prior to Paul Martin – who presided over Indian residential schools (the last one closed in 1996). Indeed, Mackenzie’s government enacted the Indian Act, for which Macdonald seems to carry all the blame.
More about Joseph Brant, for whom Brantford, Ontario is named, as is the Joseph Brant Hospital in Burlington, Ontario. Dedicated by Governor General Michaëlle Jean as recently as 2006, Brant is commemorated as one of 14 Canadians designated “hero” at the Valiants Military Memorial in Ottawa. (Nine of the heroes are memorialized with busts – only five, including Brant, with statues.)
Brant led the nations of the Iroquois League in assisting the British against the rebels in the struggle that was the American Revolutionary War. Canada’s future interests were at stake and, in this respect, Brant’s contribution to British – later, Canadian – military history, and colonization, ought never to be minimized or forgotten. All Canadians should be happy to have Brant memorialized. In the same way, the contributions of those other early leaders whose memorials are now so indecently vandalized should also be remembered and appreciated.
But there is an inconvenient truth. The elephant in the room is that Brant owned more than 30 black slaves, brought with him from Mohawk Territory in New York to the Burlington area of Ontario. 
What irony: Michaëlle Jean, a refugee from Haiti to Canada and a descendant of African slaves, commemorating a slave owner by naming him a hero.
Black slaves owned by an Indigenous Canadian: where is the outrage?
If there is any, I do hope the rage is not taken out on Brant’s proper honourable place in Canadian history, nor on his numerous memorials.
But the hypocrisy is embarrassingly evident.
The blackface painting of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau’s statue in Vaughan, Ontario last June is investigated as a hate crime, but none of the other acts of vandalism are given the same treatment. Or, apparently, any treatment at all. Some people find this very confusing.
But we should hope the current habit of spitting on our history will end soon. If this is how some people think reconciliation can happen, or that real and positive change can result, law-abiding Canadians want no part of it.
Anger about injustice is one thing, and it’s understandable; hatred and criminality are quite another.

On Facebook, strangers snipe at each other. Old friends “un-friend” each other based on political preference. Talking heads trade insults on cable “news.” The angry acting out isn’t new Four years ago New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told an interviewer on public radio “hate has become the currency of this nation. We hate, therefore we are.” The facts bore him out: The FBI had just documented a 16-year peak in all types of hate crimes.
Which brings me to some of the ways people use prejudice and personal attack as forms of identity, here in the West. In Idaho, where I’ve lived for over nine years, big diesel pickup trucks are a way of life — even for folks who live in Boise and probably don’t need them for hauling.
Before the 2016 election, I began noticing more and more big pickups with full-sized American flags mounted in the rear cab. Soon after, many of those trucks had a full-sized Confederate flag mounted on the opposite side. I asked a man who works on diesel engines why he thought so many guys in big pickups were flying the Confederate flag, here in Idaho. After all, this was the West, not the South.
“They’re just giving the finger to this f***ing politically correct government,” he said.
If that were true, then American flags as protest to Obama should have stopped once Trump was elected. Instead, there were more flags than ever before the 2020 election. I’ve come to see the flag flying as a form of personal identity.
I asked an African-American friend how the flags made him feel. “Intimidated and unwelcome,” was his reply. But they intimidate me, too, and I’m white.
Others use their trucks as weapons of aggression. I drive a 15-year-old little red sporty Japanese car. Back when I lived in southern California, the sunroof was open almost every day. In Idaho, I still like to open my sunroof on nice days. Funny thing is, even though the air here is theoretically much cleaner than it is in Los Angeles, I nearly always end up having to close it. Perhaps because my little red car is definitely not an “Idaho car.”
When somebody in a big diesel pickup equipped with “rolling coal” sees me, he inevitably speeds up, passes me, and then steps on the brakes. As I near his tail, a giant cloud of toxic black diesel exhaust blows out, and if I haven’t already shut my sunroof, I’m going to be inhaling it. What drives his aggression and gives him pleasure about harming me?
In 2017, Idaho State Sen. Michelle Stennett, D-Ketchum, introduced a bill to prohibit the practice of modifying diesel engines to increase the amount of soot and smoke belching from tailpipes. The bill failed to pass, but thanks to the Clean Air Act, rolling coal is already illegal. In Idaho, however, don’t expect much enforcement.
Unless there’s a state law, most Idaho police won’t issue tickets for rolling-coal pollution violations. The bill would have made it a misdemeanor, but the state senate decided that public health was less important than the right of angry drivers in diesel trucks to blow smoke into our faces.
I’ve also heard from bicycle riders who say they’re sitting ducks when trucks pass by while belching out black smoke, and that this is a particular problem on rural roads. It seems to me there was a time – not that long ago – when this would have been considered rude, if not downright dangerous.
The people who spew hate on the Internet or peddle conspiracy theories on Facebook, who wave flags all over town, or who blow smoke in our faces, all say they are expressing the freedom to be themselves. They are proud to be “politically incorrect.”
Last week at my local gym, a man strode angrily up to the front desk to complain about the rap music playing that day. “Turn off that f*#%in’ music and put on some rock ‘n roll!” he insisted. The staffer at the front desk was Black. After a moment of deer-in-the-headlights shock, he quickly complied.
You know what politically correct means? It means nothing more than good manners, and manners are sorely lacking these days.

In this article we use Emirbayer and Desmond’s institutional reflexivity framework to critically examine the production of racial knowledge in British criminology. Identifying weakness, neglect and marginalization in theorizing race and racism, we focus principally on the disciplinary unconscious element of their three-tier framework, identifying and interrogating aspects of criminology’s ‘obligatory problematics’, ‘habits of thought’ and ‘position-taking’ as well as its institutional structure and social relations that combine to render the discipline ‘institutionally white’. We also consider, briefly, aspects of criminology’s relationship to race, racism and whiteness in the USA. The final part of the article makes the case for British criminology to engage in telling and narrating racisms, urging it to understand the complexities of race in our subject matter, avoid its reduction to class and inequality, and to pay particular attention to reflexivity, history, sociology and language, turning to face race with postcolonial tools and resolve.
FULL TEXT
Introduction: Content and discontent
At the start of this century, Garland and Sparks (2000) called for a reconfiguring of criminology to facilitate the vibrant transformation of modes of theorizing, empirical research and political engagement (see also Carrabine, 2016; Loader and Sparks, 2011). Their exhortation was fuelled by the recognition that crime and punishment are deeply enmeshed in the routines, emotions and cultural imaginations of our everyday lives and centrally implicated in political decision making. In turn, Carbado and Roithmayr (2014), as critical race scholars, insist there is a powerful and longstanding dialectical relationship between race and crime. This operates so that when we think of crime we have black people in mind, and when we think of black people we have crime in mind. Other variations work but the prevailing paradigm is one of Otherness (or ‘non-whiteness’) being synonymous with crime or its threatening presence (see also Cuneen, 2011). Rather than engaging with this enmeshment of race, crime and the public and political imaginary, criminology has tended to focus on the numerical incidence of race and disproportionality in criminal justice outcomes, defaulting to a positivist lens of quantification, rather than theorizing race’s complex material and symbolic manifestations in the intersection with crime, control and social order (Bosworth et al., 2008; Parmar, 2016). Our concern is that the relative stasis of the ‘recited truths’ of the social construction of race are deployed in criminology through its research and teaching agendas without substantive engagement with race’s constitutive dynamism. 
This is in stark contrast to the vigour and vitality that currently propels the sociology of race (Lentin and Titley, 2011).
By way of comparison, reconfigurations of criminology with regard to gender have been more transformative. The scholarly inroads made by feminist criminology are widely regarded as distinctively and irreversibly reshaping the discipline (Burman and Gelsthorpe, 2017; Downes and Rock, 2003). This began with bringing girls/women into criminological focus from a position of neglect and challenging the unthinking generalization of androcentric criminological theories to girls’/women’s experiences (see Daly and Chesney-Lind, 1988; Heidensohn, 1968). Subsequent work has acknowledged subjectivities intersected by class, race and sexualities, unpacking variation in lifeworlds and exploring their impact on victimization, offending and treatment within the criminal justice system (Daly, 2010). Epistemological and methodological questions emanating from feminist theory have brought further refinement in articulating whose knowledge counts in the academy (Heidensohn, 2006, 2012). The feminist struggle in criminology is far from concluded and neither is gender totally analogous to race. However, our fear is that while most British criminologists would routinely introduce students to theorists of gender and class (such as Butler, Connell, Marx, Weber and the like), we suspect they might struggle to identify theoretical equivalents for race or recognize their salience to the study of crime.
The test set for criminology in Garland and Sparks’ (2000) challenge was to move beyond extant ‘habits of thought’, to embrace intellectually reflexivity, so as to better reflect the stark realities of late modernity. Two decades on, we are in the midst of politically tumultuous times. A seismic shift to the right and the forceful march of nationalistic populism means that a criminology for our times in which race is not central and fundamental is surely untenable.
Coalescing at the same time has been a resurgence of pressure ‘from below’, from students, prompting a new wave of epistemological and pedagogical attempts to decolonize the university (Arday and Mirza, 2018). Such efforts have a foundation in decolonizing movements’ political struggles in countries of the ‘Global South’ that exposed how knowledge production in elite institutions of the imperial metropole were implicated in sustaining global racialized hierarchies (Bhambra et al., 2018; see also Ladner, 1973). Today, we have seen student-led political campaigns such as UCL’s ‘Why is my curriculum white?’ (Peters, 2018), ‘Why isn’t my professor black?’ (following a panel organized by Nathaniel Adam Tobias Coleman) and ‘Rhodes Must Fall’ at Oxford (Gebrial, 2018), challenging the narrowness of curricula and academic representation. Such developments have profound implications for criminology just as much as any other discipline.
Yet there are worrying signs, we argue in this article, of criminology turning away from race (Back and Tate, 2014), or as Garner (2015) puts it, criminology’s disciplinary norms continuing to contend with race only at the margins. This is particularly evident in criminology’s tendency to elide race with class, a point we return to later in the article. In noting criminology’s suppressions, contradictions and lacunae when it comes to race and racism our intention is to highlight criminology’s carelessness rather than claim proactive discrimination (see also Unnever and Owusu-Bempah, 2019). To develop this claim further, we employ Emirbayer and Desmond’s (2012, 2015) typology of disciplinary reflexivity to consider where some of the weaknesses in the development of racial knowledge within criminology lie, additionally using an illustrative mapping of the coverage of race in a premier criminological journal, Punishment & Society.
Disciplinary reflexivity, according to Emirbayer and Desmond (2012, 2015), is key to scientific progress. It requires us to turn our analytic gaze back upon ourselves to inquire critically into the hidden presuppositions that shape our thought. This is emphatically not about ‘introspective confessionalism’ at the individual level but rather moving collectively towards ‘analyses of the institutional settings in which [race] scholars are formed, the structures and processes whereby their hidden assumptions about the world are forged’ (Emirbayer and Desmond, 2012: 592). As they note, such self-critical reflection has become increasingly commonplace in diverse disciplines including sociology, anthropology, history, philosophy and literary criticism. Specifically in the UK, the Royal Historical Society has noted the intellectual, legal, demographic and ethical rationales for challenging racial and ethnic equalities in the practice of History (Atkinson et al., 2018), and the Social Policy Association has begun its own interrogation of teaching and learning practices (Craig et al., 2019). And so we may ask, why not criminology?
Drawing from Bourdieu’s insistence on the epistemological value of reflexivity, Emirbayer and Desmond (2012, 2015) propose a three-tier model of systematically scrutinizing the social unconscious, scholastic unconscious and disciplinary unconscious to appraise the content and conduct of a discipline. Notwithstanding some theoretical caveats (Venkatesh, 2012; Winant, 2012), Emirbayer and Desmond’s call for vigilance towards the disciplinary frames that reproduce a hegemonic whiteness in sociology is also significant for criminology. And while the need for intersectional rather than a singular race-based analysis is irrefutable—we maintain that a necessary first step is to invest explicitly in theorizing race and racism (Parmar, 2017).
Criminology’s social unconscious: ‘Doing criminology while white, black and Asian’
Emirbayer and Desmond (2015) focus on the dominant normativity of whiteness against which all aspects of social and academic life are judged and the way this spills over into knowledge production. They recognize how the biographical positioning of scholars along axes of privilege and disadvantage shape our thinking and practice according to objective structural experiences and subjective understanding. Given the ubiquity of white academic criminologists—referred to as ‘this very White criminological world’ in African American Ruth D Peterson’s (2017: 251) presidential address to the American Society of Criminology—these ‘doxic experiences’ mask the whiteness of mainstream academic activity as race becomes other people’s (research and teaching) business, typically relegated to the periphery of the discipline.
An example that Emirbayer and Desmond (2015) use—of the default to whiteness as the reference category in regression analyses—has obvious applicability to empirical criminology’s analysis of risk and protective factors in predicting offending and victimization. No recent academic longitudinal studies (e.g. Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions or the Peterborough Adolescent and Young Adult Developmental Study (PADS+)) have contained large enough sub-samples of different minority ethnic groups to sustain any intra-minority analysis, hence the putative default to whiteness against which all else is compared. A second illustration of the routine skewing of racial knowledge in criminology is the effective de-racialization of corporate and state crimes in contrast to the ready racialization of violent crime, particularly serious youth violence. Indeed, as Russell-Brown (2019: 116) notes, ‘“White crime” and victimization are rarely investigated as racially specific criminological phenomena’ (but see just published Benson and Kennedy, 2019; Sohoni and Rorie, 2019).
The authors’ differing vantage points present further examples, demonstrating how the racial order is literally self-evident through our working lives. Collectively, as we developed this project (the 2018 international symposium on race at the LSE, this Special Issue and reconstituting the British Society of Criminology Race Matters network (), we have repeatedly recalled examples of these positional perspectives according to our respective racialized (and classed and gendered) identities. Briefly retold here, they offer insights into the racialized conditions of work in criminology and academic life more generally. For Phillips and Parmar, they belong within the insidious category of ‘nigger moments’, recurring reminders that ‘there is no protection, no sanctuary, no escaping’ from racism, even in the hallowed spaces of the liberal academy (Anderson, 2011: 253). For Earle and Smith, the dividends of whiteness, class and masculinity in criminology become more apparent, not least in the invitations to join all-white lists of speakers at penological events where race and racism are critical, an issue we explore more below.
For the lead author, Phillips, a telling incident occurred at an informal lunch before an editorial board meeting of the British Journal of Criminology. A white female professor joined a conversation in which she repeatedly tried to hand Phillips a bundle of administrative documents, apparently blind to the possible academic status of the only minority ethnic woman in the room. Another moment: the offer of a junior white female research officer, vacating her overnight accommodation at an academic event, to leave her door open for Phillips, who was leaving her own, neighbouring room at the same time. The woman assumed Phillips to be a cleaner rather than a fellow (more senior) academic. In another incident Parmar’s presence was rudely challenged by a white academic in front of her students in a classroom scheduling clash. Baldly told, ‘you are in the wrong room, please check with your lecturer before disturbing an ongoing class’, Parmar experienced shock and frustration, but was ultimately muted by this racial degradation ceremony, wrong-footed by the ironic continuities between her teaching and scholarship on race and gender and her own mistreatment in the academy. Normative whiteness embodied in a specific academic space can become disturbed by the arrival of black and Asian bodies in occupations which are not historically and conceptually marked out as their ‘natural’ domain; in these cases Phillips and Parmar were ‘out of place, a space invader’ (Puwar, 2004).
While ‘victim’s tales’ (Christian, 2017: 414) risk being dismissed for anecdotal and plaintive partiality, stories of being perceived as incapable of occupying high-status positions, assumptions of inferior intellect or ascriptions of criminality are common currency among minority scholars (Alexander and Arday, 2015; Johnson and Joseph-Salisbury, 2018). They are illustrative of the subtle but pervasive undercurrents of everyday racism where talk, actions, gestures signal an implicit lower status, undermining of minority scholars’ authority and expertise. They can and do add up to systemic racism when they are embedded within inequitable, racialized hierarchies of power in which temporary contracts, exclusion from Russell Group institutions and a lack of career progression, amid oral but not abiding political commitments to equality are prevailing tendencies (Ahmed, 2012; Rollock, 2019). The pretence of inclusion in a colour-blind, egalitarian academy is all too easily upended by the painful and humiliating experience of ‘nigger moments’, where regardless of class position and academic status racism penetrates everyday life in the university. The faith of white academics in the meritocracy of intellect, that it is this alone which decides who wins and who loses on the academic playing field, is the faith of those untouched by racism (or it seems, anti-racism). As Tate and Bagguley (2017: 294) put it, ‘the pervasive power of whiteliness continues to be denied and indeed is balked at, remaining unsayable within universities’.
Criminology’s scholastic unconscious: Navel-gazing in the ivory tower
Before moving to our substantive concern with what we consider the most important level of Emirbayer and Desmond’s model, the disciplinary unconscious, we turn briefly to their identification of a scholastic unconscious. Here Emirbayer and Desmond (2012) analyse the significance of remote and elevated abstraction where scholarly modes of reasoning lack both self-criticality and self-awareness. The scholastic unconscious tends towards the elevation of theoretical abstraction into a kind of discrete zone of moral, cognitive and aesthetic inquiry taken to be necessarily superior to an interpretation of the lifeworlds of the people who are its subject. It lives in the ivory tower—with the emphasis on ‘ivory’ (Alexander and Arday, 2015: 4)—free to question everything but itself.
According to Emirbayer and Desmond (2015), the scholastic unconscious proffers a false moral universalism, assuming formal equality through the assertion of colour-blindness as race and its properties are denied. It includes, for example, the misguided claim that invoking race in and of itself is profoundly racist when studying crime and the criminal justice system. Likewise, the chimerical pursuit of predictive modelling to tease out the so-called ‘independent effect’ of race/racism in criminal justice outcomes (cf. Hood, 1992; May et al., 2010) using de-historicized data ‘magically cleansed of race animus and meaning’ (Ward, 2016: 309). This has unhelpfully reinforced the notion that racism operates only in singular or binary form, marked by an identifiable presence or absence that can only be determined definitively when it can be pinned down using sophisticated statistical techniques. This positivist neutralization obscures the privileging foundations of whiteness and the historically embedded materiality of systemic racism and its legacy in contemporary realities (see also Henne and Shah, 2013).
But Emirbayer and Desmond’s (2015) ire is also directed towards the uncritical referencing of ‘heroic scholars’ work without careful interrogation in race scholarship. They remind us to be scrupulous in the analysis of racial domination, to be open to striking down the shibboleths or conventional wisdoms where appropriate (e.g. Waddington, 1986). Specificity and precision are similarly to be preferred over broad-brush acceptance of claims of structural racism without delineating the mechanisms through which such forces are effected in the everyday practices of criminal justice (Garland, 2018). Otherwise, the result is work which eulogizes or inferiorizes minority cultures, as authenticity, resistance or some other quality is attributed as a group characteristic. Regarding minority cultures as entirely determined by structural forces without agency or conversely engaging solely in rational (if problematic and sometimes criminal) actions is equally limiting (Emirbayer and Desmond, 2012). Casual sanctification and careless exotification are as problematic as malicious pathologization.
Criminology’s disciplinary unconscious: Assume the position
Attending to the disciplinary unconscious helpfully brings various aspects of criminological practice, otherwise invisible, into critical focus. Consistent with the primary concerns of this journal, the intellectual task requires the critical unpacking of criminology’s ‘traditions and national particularities, its obligatory problematics, its habits of thought, its shared beliefs and self-evidences, its rituals and consecrations, its constraints as regards publication of findings’, all of which combine to determine the nature of criminology’s knowledge of race (Emirbayer and Desmond, 2015: 39). This means interrogating the position-takings of criminology, the influential trends and coalitions of intellectual practice around which different traditions or groups of scholars gather. Here, we begin to sketch how these dynamics have shaped racialized modes of thought within criminology, additionally using a preliminary analysis of the coverage of race in the journal Punishment & Society to convey some of the current gaps as we see them.
Position-takings: Sketching criminology’s theoretical currents
Rock’s (1994) authoritative examination of criminological theories finds a disparate array of ideas circulating throughout criminology’s history. As an academic pursuit in the late 19th to mid-20th centuries he notes Lombroso’s influence and the rise of positivism, whose foundational ideas have long been dismissed for their inherent racism. Notwithstanding the pre-eminence of Sydney and Beatrice Webb’s (1922/1963) eugenicist predilections, inflected by Lombrosian themes, in their early contribution to prison studies, their work has remained an anomalous feature of British criminology. The legacy of biological positivism aligned with ideas about race briefly re-surfaced in the fraudulent genetic essentialism of Herrnstein and Murray’s (1994) The Bell Curve, with similar ideas pursued in Canada by Phillipe Rushton, but it was not a ‘national particularity’ that took hold in Britain (Emirbayer and Desmond, 2015: 39).
The heyday of sociological criminology in the USA saw the emergence of strain, ecological and subcultural theories which were, as Cullen et al.’s (2019) careful review shows, somewhat blind to race. With only a brief mention in Merton’s (1938) strain theory, racial divisions were less explicitly analysed than we might have expected, particularly given their salience in the Jim Crow era. To give but one example, Burgess’ work has been criticized for its failure to account for the role of racism in explaining why African Americans did not successfully assimilate through the concentric zones of the city over time (Valier, 2003). In Britain there was a tendency not to incorporate the exclusionary experiences of black and Asian colonial citizens in criminological work (Downes, 1966; Gilroy, 1987; Morris, 1958) although some notable exceptions exist (e.g. Hebdige, 2006). The relative silence about race in Marxist, radical and control theories, and to a degree labelling perspectives and the new penology, has largely gone unnoticed (Bowling and Phillips, 2002), although there have been some attempts to remedy this neglect (Burt et al., 2017; Gross, 2008; McCorkel, 2014; Sampson and Wilson, 1995; Unnever and Gabbidon, 2011). Such omissions reify race-blind theoretical development as race continues to be ‘forgotten, squeezed into an analytical framework as an afterthought, or relegated to the bottom of a regression table’ (Cullen et al., 2019: 46).
It is hard to underestimate the significance of critical criminology in the development of British criminology nor to dispute Carlen’s (2011) claim that it represents the mainstream of the discipline. For this reason, it is worth tracing how it has contributed to racial knowledge. The most enduring features of critical criminology, according to McLaughlin’s (2010) review, centre on the state’s ideological preference for law and mechanisms of social control to serve elite economic and political interests (McLaughlin, 2010). The resultant hegemony of crime control has operated to oppress, alienate and criminalize poor individuals and communities, while obscuring the racial partiality of the law and its enforcement. Returning to Emirbayer and Desmond (2015), this can be regarded as one of criminology’s ‘obligatory problematics’. In this regard, Hall’s et al.’s (1978) Policing the Crisis stands as an exemplary intervention, effectively fusing ideas from sociology and criminology (see also Murji, this issue).1 It centralized race, demonstrating how ‘mugging’ and black street crime became the prism through which the broader crisis of politics, economics and ideology in the late 1970s were viewed (cf. Waddington, 1986). Policing the Crisis is celebrated for the way it analysed the articulation of race within criminal justice agencies and how it maintained a fragmenting post-imperial social order (Brown, 2008). Hall’s adroit deployment of the terminology of ‘articulation’ combines both vocal connotations of expression with the pivotal linkage to structural formations, institutional processes and individual experience.
The intellectual dispute between sociologists of race and left realists in the 1980s is also valuable for understanding the production of racial knowledge in criminology. Engaging as it did with the question of why black individuals were over-represented in official crime statistics, it offered a rejection of these data in favour of an explanation centred on moral panic, authoritarianism, oppressive policing and anti-colonialist resistance (Gilroy, 1982a, 1982b). In response, mirroring the broader criminological trend, as victims’ accounts of their experiences became more audible, theoretical fault lines faded as it became impossible to think only of the social reaction to deviance or of abstract Marxist ideas about crime control (Rock, 2017). As left realists Lea and Young (1984) put it, it was all very well to see street crime as expressive and with liberatory potential, but it was also individualistic, macho, predatory, intra-class and intra-racial. Their reflections on the lived reality of victimization were well observed and those realities persist today, whether we are considering serious youth violence or hate crimes. However, Lea and Young’s account underestimated the racist impulse to violently repress the perceived inferior, threatening, anarchic, cultural outsiders through appeals to civilized (white national) law and order ideologies, as persuasively argued in Gilroy’s (1982a) work, including in There Ain’t No Black in the Union Jack (1987). Gilroy’s recollection of being ‘drummed out of writing about crime by the realists during the 1980s’ has concerning implications (cited in Back, 2014). This debate has stalled for far too long, unresolved, neglected and largely dormant.
In the 1990s there were three further developments with implications for race scholarship, albeit at the margins of the discipline. The first was the provision of a deeper insight into racist violence and the failures of state agencies to respond effectively to victims’ needs (e.g. Bowling, 1999) and the second was the annual publication of administrative data to meet the Home Secretary’s obligation under s. 95 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 to assist in preventing discrimination on the grounds of race. The latter provided national data, albeit lacking meaningful contextualization, analysis and theoretical engagement, fostering a narrowing of the race and crime debate. This was not least because the data did not afford the opportunity to pursue the ‘rituals and consecrations’, to use Emirbayer and Desmond’s (2015: 39) words, of positivist multivariate modelling (cf. Hood, 1992; May et al., 2010). The third development occurred in the wake of the Macpherson report (1999) which stimulated research examining institutional racism, shining a light on areas previously lacking robust or recent research (Lewis et al., 2006; MVA and Miller, 2000; Shute et al., 2005; Souhami, 2014), evincing a brief engagement of both criminologists and sociologists of race (Anthias, 1999; Lea, 2000; Murji, 2007; Solomos, 1999; Yuval-Davis, 1999).
Race and punishment in British criminology
As Garland (2018) has observed, penological scholarship has experienced rapid development in recent years. Imprisonment, in particular, represents the apogee of state power, and it is one of the sites where racialized patterns of social control are at their starkest. For these reasons it is apposite to think long and hard about punishment and the production of racial knowledge. Rather surprisingly, in British criminology the interrogation of racialized patterns of criminalization and punishment are largely presented as if they are most meaningfully and problematically a US phenomenon. Racism in criminal justice has come to be characterized through the American paradigm and recognized as principally an issue for the USA, undoubtedly because of its sheer scale, but this erases corresponding patterns elsewhere and feeds an illusion that the conjunction of racism and criminal justice is a singularly US construct (cf. Wacquant, 1999). The USA being treated as the worst-case scenario rather than part of a more expansive late modern iteration of a global racial order all too often provides other states with an alibi for neglecting their own racial differentials and accounting for their own specific racial histories (Earle, 2019).
This is all rather curious given Tonry’s (1994) work in the 1990s. Published in the British Journal of Criminology as incarceration rates were well on their way to reaching their peak in the USA, Tonry’s analysis clearly showed that if we look at the degree of prison disproportionality using incarceration rates the black–white ratio was highest in Australia (involving indigenous populations) followed by England and Wales, with the USA relegated to—unusually in relation to punishment—third place (see also Phillips, 2012). Thus, one of the stark realities of late modern Britain is ongoing racial disproportionality in state detention that at times has outstripped that of the USA (but see Ministry of Justice, 2017). The ‘habit of thought’ of British criminology that defers to the US carceral atrocity is dangerous, not least because as Emirbayer and Desmond (2015: 5-6) stress, while we hear frequent, loosely post-racial talk of racism being more restrained and less harsh than in previous eras or than in other countries, ‘there is nothing particularly quiet, subtle, or invisible about the staggering racial disparities along the poverty line or within the criminal justice system’, and this holds true on both sides of the Atlantic (Phillips and Bowling, 2017).
A preliminary, admittedly limited, systematic mapping of one premier criminology journal, Punishment & Society, documents this tendency towards US penological scholarship on race. Table 1 indicates an increasing substantive focus on questions of race in the last two decades which is very much to be welcomed. Further analysis shows, however, that of the 46 articles with substantive references to race over the period 1999 to mid-2018, 70% (n = 32) focused on the USA with just 9% (n = 4) analysing punishment in England and Wales. Self-evidently only indicative of the contours of race within one journal, it offers some substantiation of our suspicion that race in the UK is not well articulated in mainstream criminological literature on punishment.

A likely factor explaining this blind spot, we think, is that poverty and economic inequality remain the primary vector through which crime and justice are understood. Seeking to assert the primacy of class in his disavowal of ‘over-racialized’ accounts of incarceration, Matthews’ (2017) realist account risks underplaying the conditioning logic of racism in postcolonial settings. This preoccupation with class, being one of criminology’s commonsensical doxa, one of its ‘shared beliefs and self-evidences’ (Emirbayer and Desmond, 2015: 39), assumes a singularity of explanation in which, as Shilliam (2018: 96) observes ‘economic inequality is a class issue that race is safely derivative of [. . .] [with] class removed from its racial constitution and imperial constellation’. Evidently, this is not a peculiarly criminological deficiency, for as Alexander (2018: 1044) scathingly notes in relation to sociological research on inequalities, the dynamics of race are similarly frequently masked or neglected as an ‘inconvenient complication’. This seems to be a characteristic of much contemporary UK scholarship, despite the consistently stark realities of racialized criminalization and punishment.
In tracing more recent ‘habits of thought’ in criminology there have been new empirical and theoretical developments including expansion in studies of terrorism, social harms, hate crime, cultural and green criminology, migration and border criminology. While these new advances grow and enrich the discipline, each have developed with race and racism only implicit in their analyses, typically vaguely specified, largely under-theorized—or arguably in the case of the idiosyncratic postures of ultra-realist criminology, akin to the ‘colour-blind socialists’ mentioned by Virdee (2015)—actively minimized and effectively denied as a feeble-minded throwback to obsolete and inadequate critical traditions (see Hall, 2012). This, despite Virdee’s (2014) comprehensive account of the English working class pointing to its essentially multi-ethnic formation and (sometimes anti-racist) character throughout its history, while also documenting the corrosive effects of its racist factionalism. A reminder of the ‘non-reductiveness of race and ethnicity as social features’, their relative autonomy from class and their centrality as an organizing principle of postcolonial societies is long overdue and increasingly urgent for the contemporary criminological landscape (Hall, 1980: 306).
The idea of racial capitalism may be useful in developing this theoretical thread further (Bhattacharyya, 2018). As Virdee (2019: 6) suggests, this necessitates co-locating ‘colonization and racism within the unfolding story of historical capitalism over the past half a millennium’, albeit with the cultural, political and ideological modalities of contemporary racisms also specified. The reinvigoration of the criminological field demands an historical analysis which takes into account the variegated logics of racial domination and violence in colonial and postcolonial times, the symbolic and emotional aspects of racial meanings, migration histories and trajectories, endowments of human capital, modes of integration, as well as cultural practices and lifestyles. This will need to incorporate macro-level structural forces, micro-level everyday experiences, as well as the meso-level field of the institutions of the criminal justice system. It demands analysis that is nationally specific and adequate to the variable historical formations of race and colonialism.
Organizational structure and social relations
Garland (1994) characterizes criminology as eclectic and disparate in its approaches and theories. Its development in England was driven and secured through the efforts of Jewish emigrants—Radzinowicz at Cambridge University, Grünhut at Oxford University and Mannheim at LSE (Rock, 1994). Becoming more fully fledged from the 1930s to the 1960s, Garland (1994) maintains, postgraduate teaching provision, journals, a professional association and government-funded research programmes cemented its position as an academic discipline. In this sense, criminology in the UK has historically been both a conventional scientific endeavour and a pragmatic, problem-oriented one with an eye towards governmental priorities, intervention and funding. Yet, perhaps surprisingly, criminology is also unusually invested in its own deconstruction (Cohen, 1988). Cohen’s (2011: xxxv) work aligns with our misgivings and his prognosis that criminology is prone to ‘taking some things too seriously and other things not seriously enough’ seems apt.
Garland (2011) affirms criminology can best maintain its intellectual strength when it is integrated and in dialogue with its constitutive, parent disciplines of sociology, psychology and law. It is the ‘rendezvous’ character of the discipline that can prevent it being exclusively focused on policy-oriented criminal justice concerns, seen by some to predominate in the less highly ranked educational institutions (Matthews, 2017). Their emphasis on vocational utility can be regarded as troubling when it reflects what Hobbs (2012: 262) calls criminology’s ‘loss of its sociological soul’. Clearly a valid concern, it is nonetheless the expansive context of criminology in post-1992 universities, rather than in the more prestigious and traditional research-active institutions, where minority ethnic scholars and students are most likely to be located (Equality Challenge Unit, 2017). These forms of academic segregation and hierarchy that hinge so persistently around race may be relatively obscure to white scholars but remain a key feature of the national and international criminological landscape, determining job opportunities, academic progression and research recognition (Alexander and Arday, 2015; Warikoo, 2016).
Statistical data documenting more minority ethnic than white academics on temporary contracts, fewer in senior roles, with fewer minority ethnic students attending Russell Group institutions, and their lower attainment in degree performance, have emphasized intersecting concerns about inequality and racism in the UK’s higher education institutions (Equality Challenge Unit, 2017; Tate and Bagguley, 2017). Conditioned by this reality, the racialized dynamics of criminological expansion are completely neglected, yet they are very much part of the disciplinary unconscious, particularly in elite institutions where whiteness is rarely problematized but even more ubiquitous (Peterson, 2017; Reay, 2018). Undoubtedly of relevance too is the broader concern about the absence of theoretical development in the discipline as a whole (Carrabine, 2016; Hobbs, 2012).
Notwithstanding, in what Back and Tate (2014) identify as the ‘bleaching’ of sociology we recognize features and dynamics of their analysis that are also salient to criminology (see also Virdee, 2019). Despite criminology being centrally concerned with issues of governing, categorization and social order, race and ethnicity have been largely relegated to subfields within the discipline, confined to a periphery that limits access to the dominant frames of reference creating contemporary criminological knowledge (Bosworth et al., 2008). As a result, criminology remains ‘analytically white’ (Hesse, 2014: 143) because it consistently fails to situate contemporary formations of crime and its institutional controls within historical racial configurations constructed as part of the dominant social order.
Sociology is beginning to see an intellectual shift undermining its foundational modes of knowledges as the canon of Marx, Weber, Durkheim, Giddens, Foucault and Bourdieu has been shown to have paid scant attention to societies outside of the West (Connell, 2006; Go, 2013; Virdee, 2019). This complicity in colonial optics that homogenized, inferiorized or exoticized people not of the West arose from the neglect of the processes of empire-building, colonization and decolonization. Criminology must take note, otherwise it risks being forever ‘haunted and constrained by its inability to shake the colonizing whiteness that continues to colour its imagination’ (Back and Tate, 2014: 124), particularly if it does not engage more critically with its canonical affinity with sociology. More than 25 years ago Russell-Brown (Russell, 1992) identified this trait in the US criminological canon and the corresponding need for a black criminology, as did Phillips and Bowling (2003) in proposing the development of minority perspectives in UK criminology—both seemingly falling on deaf ears (Russell-Brown, 2019; Unnever and Owusu-Bempah, 2019).
What Bhambra (2015: 475) calls the ‘politics of canon formation’ and their deconstruction in sociology has yet to gather momentum in criminology with regard to race, even though we have African American criminologists Gabbidon, Greene and Young (Gabbidon, 2001; Gabbidon et al., 2001; Greene and Gabbidon, 2000) to thank for their illuminating anthology of African American scholars previously excluded from the criminological canon, including Wells-Barnett, Du Bois, Work and Franklin Frazier. Their work sought to dispel pathological views of African American culture, chronicling and analysing their lived realities in the Jim Crow era. In recent years, postcolonial influences have emerged to demonstrate their potential but a specific and consistent focus on race and racism remains missing from mainstream criminology (Agozino, 2003; Cain, 2000; Carrington et al., 2016; Cuneen, 2011).
Narrating race and telling racism
Sketching the contributions of race scholarship in criminology and suggesting some future lines of inquiry can be disruptive of old habits of thought but it is not enough by itself. Re-historicizing the contemporary contours of race is an urgent intellectual task. We can only contextualize the present and shape the future by understanding the past. Criminological amnesia towards Britain’s history and role in the legitimation of systemic violence and punishment of populations through slavery and colonization is a particular omission, and the indifference to its ongoing consequences and implications remain pressing concerns, particularly in discussions of state crime (Agozino, 2003). Similar issues are at stake with the traction achieved by the fallacious formulation of a post-racial condition which has been widely debated in sociology (Goldberg, 2015). Furthermore, yet to be integrated into critical analyses of the working of the criminal justice system is the relevance of the resurgence of racial biologism through genomics (Duster, 2015) and how the corporeality and comportment of racialized bodies (Omi and Winant, 2016) affect processes of criminalization. Deeper excavation into the consequences, the existential and psychic costs of ongoing racializing practices for black male bodies has also thus far largely escaped criminological attention (Yancy, 2017). Digital technologies and artificial intelligence are increasingly implicated in these dynamics and their racializing potential exposes the limitations of an analytically white criminology. Facial recognition, big data analytics and algorithmic assessments are increasingly implemented in criminal justice spheres to reduce human effort and democratize encounters in areas such as policing. Yet they have been shown to reproduce coded forms of racism that are harder to trace thereby diffusing accountability (Benjamin, 2019; Buolamwini and Gebru, 2018; Noble, 2018; Parmar, 2019). The emergence and impact of citizens’ movements and insurgencies like Black Lives Matter in the USA, JENGbA and StopWatch in the UK (Emirbayer and Desmond, 2015; Shiner et al., 2018) are crucial for advances in criminological thought. And while there are political risks involved in unpacking racialized tensions and interactions between minority ethnic groups such work is necessary to more fully understand the dynamics of our complex social world.
Epistemologically and methodologically there is also a need for a re-fusing of humanistic, artistic styles and scientific styles of reasoning to more holistically represent and interpret intersectional realities (Stanfield, 1985). Back and Tate (2014: 125) describe how Du Bois, for example, evocatively incorporated the ‘personal pains of racism’ and humiliations wrought in the Jim Crow period with a sociological sensitivity in works such as The Souls of Black Folk (1901). Their illustration of this synthesis is in Du Bois’ telling of the racism of white onlookers as he travelled alongside the coffin of his baby son, while also referencing high infant mortality rates among ‘Negro Americans’. Du Bois is lauded for integrating history, biography, sociology, black literary arts and culture, and on occasion, fiction into his analytical frame. Implicit in this approach is the value of intertwining personal reflections on political positioning in literary prose, to use personal troubles and inner lives at the micro level framed by history and social structure to enable a properly sociological imagination (Mills, 1959/2000). Hence, the telling of our experiences of race in criminology’s social unconscious earlier in this article. It is an approach that involves eschewing the restrained neutrality expected of academic work in order to narrate the affective and ontological dynamics of economic and political lives lived by minority ethnic people (as bearers of intersectional identities that include our occupational ones as criminologists).
We have been inspired to take Agozino’s (2003) lead as he rejects ‘criminological orientalism’ by creatively combining theory, history and poetics in his own work using the ‘insurrectional lyrics’ of Jamaican reggae artist, Peter Tosh, to conceptualize oppressive policing. As authors of varied ages, each of our generations has its equivalents: Linton Kwesi Johnson’s (1979) Sonny’s Lettah, a vivid oration of the spectacularly violent use of ‘sus’ powers and Macka B’s (1984) We’ve Had Enough (1984) describing the ‘Babylonian murder’ of Clinton McCurbin and the ‘neverending list’ of others killed in police encounters; Dizzee Rascal’s (2007) Sirens where white fox hunters pursue the black police suspect and P Money’s (2016) Stereotype wistfully noting ‘[i]f they acted like black lives matter, I wouldn’t have to make a track like this’—are all brutally eloquent in capturing the essence of how policing can be felt, endured and defied. They offer powerful means to elucidate political consciousness, develop criminological insights and mobilize resistance by foregrounding experiences defined by race and racism.
Glynn (2019) is pioneering exciting forms of engagement using spoken word, hip-hop and theatre to generate new alliances among criminologists, community activists and performance artists to resist the degradations of racism and the injustices of criminal justice.2 The model of co-production of music, performance and social media anchored within criminological theory is also being used by white scholars in the Distant Voices project using Scottish traditions of music-making and story-telling (Urie et al., 2019). Such projects offer new crafts for a reflexive discipline not as a rejection of ‘the master’s tools’, as Audre Lorde warned, but in recognition of their current limitations. It is a demand for the academic freedom to use other tools ‘in order to define and seek a world in which we can all flourish’ (Lorde, 1984: 112). In seeking intellectual progress and innovation there is a long but exciting to-do list to take criminology beyond the pale.

WASHINGTON -- Philonise Floyd, whose brother's death in police custody has inspired two weeks of sprawling protests across the country, made an impassioned plea to Congress on Wednesday to enact sweeping changes to law enforcement in America to address police brutality and systemic racism. 
 In wrenching testimony on Capitol Hill, Mr. Floyd described to the House Judiciary Committee the agony he felt as he watched the video of George Floyd, his older brother, dying while pinned under the knee of a white police officer for nearly nine minutes, gasping that he could not breathe. The elder Mr. Floyd was arrested over a complaint that he had bought cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill.
 ''I am asking you, is that what a black man's life is worth? Twenty dollars?'' Mr. Floyd asked. ''This is 2020. Enough is enough. The people marching in the streets are telling you enough is enough.''
 Mr. Floyd was the first witness and marquee voice among more than a half-dozen civil rights experts and activists at a hearing called to consider the most expansive federal intervention into law enforcement that lawmakers have proposed in recent memory, which was put forth by Democrats this week. His remarks came a day after his brother was laid to rest in Houston, amid a groundswell of public support for the Black Lives Matter movement, widespread protests that have convulsed big cities and small towns alike, and a rapidly unfolding national conversation on race in the United States.
 ''Sitting here, coming to try to tell you all about how I want justice for my brother, I just think about that video over and over again,'' Mr. Floyd said in tears.
 What happened to his brother, he said, was ''a modern-day lynching in broad daylight.''
 His testimony added to the mounting sense of urgency on Capitol Hill to overhaul law enforcement practices and address systemic racism in policing. House Democrats have indicated that they intend to act quickly, with a vote on their legislation planned by the end of the month. Congressional Republicans, faced with a rapid shift in public opinion, are scrambling to coalesce around a legislative response.
 Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the committee, opened the hearing with the words ''I can't breathe,'' quoting the phrase uttered by Mr. Floyd and other black men who have died in police custody.
 ''The nation is demanding that we enact meaningful change,'' Mr. Nadler said. He called for Congress to institute a new paradigm for law enforcement that he described as ''a guardian -- not warrior -- model of policing.''
 The Democrats' bill proposes significant changes to the rules that govern how police officers operate and how they can be held accountable for wrongdoing, and would make it easier to identify, track and prosecute police misconduct. It would curtail protections that shield officers accused of misconduct from being prosecuted, ban chokeholds and other neck-pressure tactics like the one used on Mr. Floyd, and mandate that law enforcement officers use deadly force only as a last resort.
 The hearing, which stretched through the day, was punctuated by bursts of emotion, as Mr. Floyd detailed the pain his family has felt since his death. Representative Lucy McBath, a black Democrat from Georgia, whose son, Jordan, was shot and killed by a white man after he refused to turn down his rap music at a gas station tearfully replied, ''I know your pain.''
 Tracing a connection between her own loss, the death of Mr. Floyd, and the death of Ahmaud Arbery, who was fatally shot after armed white residents chased him during a run, Ms. McBath described the continued violence against black men as ''a sucker punch in my heart and my gut.''
 ''I pray every single day for our nation,'' Ms. McBath said. ''I pray every single day for every family, and I pray that today, we finally do something about it.''
 Republicans on the panel said they agreed that the nation's policing needed to be overhauled, and Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the panel said the public was hungering for ''a real discussion, real debate and real solutions about the police treatment of African-Americans.'' But they spent much of their time condemning activists calling for defunding the police, a proposal not included in the Democrats' bill.
 And many of them appeared to take issue with the animating idea behind the protests and the Democratic legislation -- that there is systemic racism in law enforcement -- instead arguing that the problem was ''bad apples'' in police departments, as Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the minority leader, and several other Republicans put it.
 ''From where we sit right now, we believe the most actionable reforms must focus on three core concepts: simple transparency, training and termination of those rare bad apples in law enforcement,'' said Mr. McCarthy, who is not a member of the committee but made a point of appearing to introduce Angela Jacobs Underwood, one of the Republican witnesses.
 There were some glimmers of bipartisan agreement. Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, and a close ally of President Trump, approvingly singled out measures in the Democratic package that would ban the use of chokeholds and make lynching a federal hate crime.
 ''You can count on Republican cooperation as we hone these ideas and hopefully pass them and get them to the president's desk,'' Mr. Gaetz told Democrats.
 Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin and a former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, endorsed the proposal in Democrats' legislation to create a national registry of police misconduct. He also denounced police unions, accusing them of protecting ''bad cops,'' and saying they would need to ''step up to the plate'' in rooting out their own bad actors.
 ''I would hope that as this debate goes on we have speedier resolutions of getting rid of bad cops,'' Mr. Sensenbrenner said. ''I see nothing wrong with having a bad cop database, but having a database isn't going to get somebody fired who ought to be fired.''
 Still, Republicans and the witnesses they invited did not dwell on specific elements of the bill, and focused mostly on defending law enforcement. Mr. Jordan equated Mr. Floyd's death with that of Dave Underwood, a federal officer who was killed in the line of duty during protests last month in Oakland, Calif., calling both deaths ''as wrong as wrong can be.''
 After Mr. Floyd testified, Republicans called Angela Jacobs Underwood, Mr. Underwood's sister.
 Congressional Democrats' legislation would not defund or otherwise dismantle police departments, though it would condition some federal grants on adoption of anti-discrimination measures and other practices meant to prevent the excessive use of force. But Representative Karen Bass, Democrat of California and the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, a key sponsor of the bill, told reporters she found Republicans' focus on the defund movement on Wednesday to be an encouraging sign.
 ''They're talking about defunding the police -- fine,'' Ms. Bass said. ''That doesn't have anything to do with what we're doing. So that makes me feel a little hopeful.''
 After delivering his testimony on Capitol Hill, Mr. Floyd visited Black Lives Matter Plaza, the area in front of the White House where federal officials used chemical spray to clear demonstrators protesting police misconduct and his brother's death. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser of Washington later directed city workers to paint the mantra in large yellow letters down the street.
 Flanked by his lawyer, Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, Democrat of Texas, and other protesters, Mr. Floyd raised his fist and shouted with them, ''George Floyd matters.''

There was a fisherman in Alaska, a veteran firefighter in Connecticut and the father of a student killed in a school shooting in Parkland, Fla.
There was a fourth-generation family farmer in Kansas, a recent college graduate in Montana, a registered nurse in New York and a tribal activist in South Dakota.
And finally, after a roughly 30-minute virtual tour of America, there were Gov. John Carney and Senator Tom Carper of Delaware, standing at the Joseph R. Biden Jr. Railroad Station in Wilmington.
“I have known Joe Biden for 40 years,” Mr. Carper said. “There’s nobody I trust more to lead our party, unite the country and restore our standing in the world.”
Then, together, as the 56 states and territories before them had done, the two Delaware politicians cast the state’s 32 official nominating votes for their favorite son, Mr. Biden, to become the Democratic Party’s nominee for president, capping a convention roll call unlike any other.
Here is a quick rundown of people who cast votes Tuesday night, where they spoke from, and selected remarks they made.
ALABAMA Representative Terri Sewell:
“If we want to honor John Lewis’s incredible life, let’s restore the voting rights act and ensure our democracy belongs to all Americans.”

But now we have three family members that tested positive for Covid, and it just doesn’t feel safe to put Evan and Emma back to school. This is going to be hard on them and on us. But millions of working families will have it much harder. I know Joe Biden cares about these struggles, and that’s why I trust him to fight for us.”

DELAWARE Gov. John Carney, left, and Senator Tom Carper:
“Our nation faces daunting challenges. But I’ve known Joe Biden for 40 years and there’s nobody I trust more to lead our party, unite the country and restore our standing in the world. What’s more he’s humble, he tells the truth and treats everybody he encounters with respect and builds bridges, not walls,” Mr. Carper said.
“Delaware is proud to cast 32 votes for our favorite son and our next president,” Mr. Carney added.

“When my daughter was murdered in Parkland, Joe Biden called to share our family’s grief. I quickly learned about decency and his civility.

Over time, my wife, Ghazala, and I have come to know his soul. He’s a decent, compassionate man. He will bring this nation together.”

The present study aims at explaining individual differences in self-reported political violence. We integrate key concepts from the field of criminology that are conceptually related to social identity theory (Flemish identity, feelings of group superiority, and ethnocentrism) and the dual process model on prejudice (perceived injustice, perception of threat, and right-wing authoritarianism). In our model, social identity concepts are hypothesized to play a mediating role between mechanisms derived from the dual process model and political violence. To test the integrated model, a model was run for testing the strength of direct and indirect effects of perceived injustice, authoritarianism thrill-seeking behavior, feelings of superiority, Flemish nationalism, ethnocentrism, right-wing extremist beliefs, and exposure to racist peers on political violence. The analyses are based on a web survey (N = 723) among adolescents and young adults in Flanders, Belgium. Results indicate that social identity variables play an important mediation role between perceptions and ideological attitudes related to injustice, and political violence. The main path revealed by our study is that perceived injustice may result in heightened perceptions of threat, which in turn positively influence levels of right-wing authoritarianism. Mediated by ethnocentrism, this variable has a significant and positive effect on right-wing beliefs, which in turn has a positive effect on political violence.
FULL TEXT
The present study starts from an integrated theoretical approach to political violence. Political violence can be explained from different theoretical perspectives in criminology ranging from strain theory, control theory, and social learning theory. However, since the 1990s, one can observe attempts to integrate the study of (political) violence against the broader framework of several theoretical perspectives. Regarding traditional theories of offending, Elliott, Ageton, and Canter (1979) argued more than two decades ago that theoretical reliance on separate explanations of offending has resulted in the diffusion of middle-range theories that can explain only a small percentage of the variance in offending. That statement is equally true for the explanation of political violence (Opp, 2009). Therefore, the present study starts from a conceptually integrated approach toward political violence.
The integrated framework we propose to study individual differences in political violence is based on the principle of end-to-end integration. End-to-end integration entails the integration of mechanisms that play a role in differing theories so that the dependent variables of some theories become the independent variables of the integrated theory (Messner & Krohn, 1989). The integrated model is meant as an action theory, that is, a wide reasonable actor approach that recognizes that actors have agency and choose, based on their preferences (normative and nonnormative), perceived opportunities and threats, and perceived utilities. Such a wide version of rational choice theory is fully in line with Tversky and Kahneman’s (1992) prospect theory, which argues that humans are suboptimal decision makers (and not merely rational agents as supposed by proponents of a narrow, micro-economic versions of rational choice theory argue; see Opp, 2017, for a discussion on wide versions of rational choice theory).
Basically, we propose an integrated perspective to study political violence that incorporates concepts of perceived injustice theory (relative deprivation theory, see Bernstein & Crosby, 1980; Gurr, 1970), integrated threat theory (ITT), social identity theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1974), and self-control theory. We propose that perceived group threat, perceived injustice, and authoritarianism exert a positive influence on right-wing extremist beliefs, which in turn affects seeing political violence and vandalism as a viable action alternative. In our model, the effects of perceived group threat, perceived injustice, and authoritarianism are hypothesized to be largely mediated by mechanisms that relate to social identity, that is, Flemish identity, ethnocentrism, and feelings of in-group superiority (e.g., Doosje, van den Bos, Loseman, Feddes, & Mann, 2012).
However, most social psychological inquiries do not consider low self-control. This is surprising as low self-control is a very consistent covariate of violent behavior, which has been tested thoroughly, even so in hate crime literature (e.g., McDevitt, Levin, & Bennett, 2004; Walters, 2011). Low self-control is an additional factor that plays a role in the process of self-selection of individuals in social milieus (exposure to racist peers). The strength of our integrated approach is that we integrate these variables in the model, thus bringing together two different traditions to increase our understanding of how individual attitudes and characteristics translate into political violence.
To guide this integration, we rely on current theorizing on intergroup dynamics, notably parochial altruism, the dual process model, and social identity theory. Compared with the dual process model and social identity theory, parochial altruism is a relatively new approach to the study of intergroup dynamics which is rooted in evolutionary psychology (e.g., Bowles, 2008; Choi & Bowles, 2007). The central tenet of this approach is that people have cognitive mechanisms through which they are ready to bear a cost to the benefit of the group they belong to when faced with threats, especially when these threats are attributable to a specific out-group. This concept has been applied to politically/ideologically motivated intergroup behaviors such as terrorism and hate crimes in the past (e.g., Wright, 2015), and provides the central logic in our conceptual model. The basic logic in our model is that political violence occurs if (a) there is a clear threat to the in-group, (b) which assumes that the dynamic is dependent on the level and type of identification with that in-group. The discussion of the variables is organized along the lines of the theoretical background sketched above. First, a set of variables relating to the dual process model will be discussed, followed by a set of variables relating to social identity theory and a set of variables relating to self-control theory. The overall conceptual model is displayed in figure 1.

Perceived Injustice, Group Threat, and Authoritarianism
To grasp what the specific threat to the in-group can mean, we draw upon the dual process model on prejudice developed by Duckitt, Wagner, du Plessis, and Birum (2002). This model constitutes a cognitive motivational model, in which two ideological attitudinal dimensions, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO), are considered to be the two main factors that influence prejudice (e.g., Duckitt et al., 2002; Duriez & Van Hiel, 2002). Both have a differential influence on prejudice, as both are expected to become salient under different conditions. In this sense, social dominance is expected to become salient in a context of competition and RWA is expected to become salient if an individual perceives the world as a dangerous place. Whereas they are firmly rooted in certain personality traits, contextual or structural factors may equally influence the perception of the world as either a dangerous (RWA) or competitive (SDO) place.
RWA
To the purpose of this study, the focus will largely be on RWA. The reason for this is that it has been explicitly been brought into relationship with the evolution of human sociality and, consequently, parochial altruism. It is parochial altruism that provides for the theoretical backbone of this study, and the explicit rooting of RWA in this concept ensures theoretical coherence of the model developed in this study. Second, RWA corresponds to the worldview that the social world is a dangerous and threatening place in which good, decent people’s values and way of life are threatened by bad people versus belief that the social world is a safe, secure and stable place in which almost all people are fundamentally good. (Duckitt et al., 2002, p. 192)
This perception of the world results in a heightened motivation for security, social order, and social cohesion. Individuals high in RWA will therefore display a preference for groups that have stable norms and in which these norms are effectively upheld (“policed”). It is expressively threat driven, and includes both realistic and symbolic threats (e.g., Asbrock, Sibley & Duckitt, 2010). Out-groups, then, are usually seen as threats to their traditional values.
Group Threat
Given the fact that RWA is explicitly threat-driven, we expect perceived group threat to have a positive effect on it in a context of political-ideological violence. Researchers often observe strong effects of group threat on prejudice toward out-groups. In social psychology, a long-standing research tradition that focuses on the context of threats to the in-group is ITT, which can be regarded as the most important integrative threat-related theory to day (e.g., Stephan & Stephan, 1996, 2000). In ITT, both realistic and symbolic threat—the two classic approaches to threat-studies—are combined and complemented by the addition of negative stereotypes and intergroup anxiety as additional sources of threat (for a meta-analytic review, see Riek, Mania, & Gaertner, 2006). To the purpose of this study, however, we focus on realistic and symbolic threats given their explicit relation with and compatibility with RWA.
The first type of threat, realistic threat, stems from Sherif and Sherif’s realistic threat theory (also referred to as realistic group conflict theory; see Sherif, 1966, 1988; Sherif & Sherif, 1953). In this theory, intergroup relations are considered to display characteristics that go beyond the characteristics of a single group. That is, group norms (intragroup) are forged based on intergroup relations. While good intergroup relations and shared goals attenuate intergroup bias, realistic conflict over resources (both material and tangible, or other resources such as power and status) can worsen intergroup relations and lead to both prejudice and violent extremism. The main argument of the theory is that people will display negative out-group behavior if they are involved in a real competition with that out-group (for a meta-analysis, consult Jackson, 1993; for a discussion on various types of realistic threat consult Sears & Henry, 2003). While the original emphasis of the theory was on real competition, more recent research indicates that, next to actual competition or threats, the perception of threat suffices to achieve intergroup bias (Beaton & Tougas, 2001; Brown, Maras, Masser, Vivian, & Hewstone, 2001; Esses, Dovidio, Jackson, & Armstron, 2001; McLaren, 2003; Zarate, Garcia, Garza, & Hitlan, 2004).
As opposed to the realistic threats proposed by realistic conflict theory, symbolic threat focuses on conflicting values between different groups, or conflicting beliefs (e.g., Sears & Henry, 2003). In this context, it has been shown that the more conflicting the values or beliefs of the groups are, the more negative the attitudes toward those groups will be (e.g., Dunbar, Saiz, Stela, & Saez, 2000). However, even though the two approaches may have been competitive in the past, nowadays they are viewed as being complementary rather than mutually exclusive (e.g., McLaren, 2003; Riek et al., 2006).
Perceived Injustice
Both realistic and symbolic threats can, in turn, be triggered by perceptions of injustice. Studies of political violence have repeatedly drawn attention to channels of inequality and injustice. Within the field of criminology, it has especially been the merit of Agnew to stress the importance of perceived injustice. In his general strain theory (GST), Agnew argued that confrontation with negatively valued stimuli causes strain, which can pressure adolescents into crime (by stimulating negative emotions and violent beliefs; Agnew, 2006, 2011).
In our theoretical model, we consider perceived injustice to be an antecedent factor of group threat. In this sense, it is a more generalized feeling of being treated unfairly or the perception that the in-group is relatively disadvantaged over other groups in society which may result in perceptions of group threat once this generalized feeling can be attributed to a specific out-group. In this sense, the attributions of the cause of the negatively valued stimuli people are confronted which can be conceptualized as a self-serving attribution, one of the fundamental attribution biases in attribution theory (e.g., Malle, 2004; Pettigrew, 1979). In this vein, we hypothesize that a general perception of injustice, which is subsequently attributed to an external factor (the out-group), can heighten levels of RWA. This line of reasoning is furthermore consistent with social identity theory, given the fact that external attributions, inter alia, serve the purpose of protecting self-esteem. This brings us to the second cluster of variables in our model, which are related to social identity theory. They are conceived of as intermediate variables that mediate the effects of perceived injustice, perceived group threat, and RWA.
Flemish Identity, Ethnocentrism, and Feelings of Superiority
Social identity theory can be regarded as one of the most fundamental theories in the explanation of intergroup dynamics. It relies on one of the most fundamental cognitive mechanisms by which people relate to the social world: social categorization (even though social identity theory ought not to be equalized with social categorization given its more limited scope). Per social identity theory, once a social identity is salient, it will affect our perceptions and shape our actions (Tajfel & Turner, 1974). In the explanation of ideological/political violence, identity factors play a crucial role. As discussed earlier, social categorization and external attribution to an out-group are the fundamental triggers of such violence. These factors explicitly refer to a group to which someone belongs, resulting in a salient social identity.
In this context, it is important to note that social identity has been considered to have a strong mediating role in respect of perceived group threats (e.g., Doosje, Loseman, & van den Bos, 2013) as well as related factors such as RWA which are explicitly rooted in perceptions of group threat. When social identity is salient, group threats (or perceptions thereof) may more easily result in more active, aggressive responses to that threat or the source of it (e.g., Fischer, Haslam, & Smith, 2010) such as politically or ideologically inspired violent behaviors. For this reason, we have retained three criminological variables that relate to social identity as mediating variables between the first cluster of variables and the outcome variables. These variables are ethnocentrism, Flemish identity, and feelings of superiority.
Flemish Identity and Superiority
In addition to the aforementioned sources of threats discussed in ITT, two other additional sources of threats have been discerned by Riek et al. (2006), which are derived from social identity theory, originally formulated by Tajfel and Turner. The theory focuses explicitly on the relationship between self-esteem, as derived from belonging to a positively valued in-group, and derogation of out-groups. Three sources of social identity are discerned: self-conceptualization, group self-esteem, and commitment to the group.
A first type of threat in this respect are group esteem threats and relate to the claim that individuals identify themselves with positively valued in-groups. When the prestige of the in-group is threatened, prejudice may be the result (when leaving the group is not possible or desirable; for example, Leach, Spears, Branscombe, & Doosje, 2003; Ouwerkerk, de Gilder, & de Vries, 2000). A second and related threat is distinctiveness threat. When distinctiveness between groups is low, high in-group identifiers are more likely to react to out-groups given the importance the in-group identity has for them (e.g., Jetten, Spears, & Manstead, 2001). Furthermore, levels of intergroup bias tend to be higher when intergroup distinctiveness is low, however, only weakly so (based on a meta-analysis by Jetten, Spears, & Postmes, 2004). To the purpose of this study, Flemish identity and feelings of superiority (self-esteem) can thus play a crucial role in the etiology of political violence.
Ethnocentrism
While high identification with the in-group, in this case, Flemish identity, can be viewed as one aspect of what is generally called a “negative worldview,” a second concept within the perspective of a “negative worldview” is ethnocentrism, which includes two dimensions, as it refers to a positive attitude toward the “in-group” and, within that same context, a related negative view of the “out-group” (e.g., Willems, 1995). Research has already indicated that ethnocentrism may lead to negative stereotypes, negative prejudices, and negative behavior toward minorities (Bircan, 2012). Tajfel and Turner (1974) indicated in their social identity theory that the shared experiences, values, and norms of the group play a major role in the development of a social identity and status of the group in relation to its enemies. They refer to a psychological process that is involved in in-group socialization and is related to the path that individuals take when entering a group (Guimond, 2000). Eisinga and Scheepers (1989) have built upon the theory of Tajfel and Turner, stating that there is not only a positive identification but that the concept also contains a negative identification toward the “out-group” (contra-identification). The “in-/out-group” relationship allows people to break down the barriers to committing violent acts (Heitmeyer & Hagan, 2003; Van der Valk & Wagenaar, 2010). For this reason, ethnocentrism is operationalized as a negative view of the out-group and is expected to be influenced by both Flemish identity and feelings of superiority. Theoretically, it is expected to have a significant and positive effect on right-wing extremist beliefs. The reasoning here is that threats to the status of the in-group are likely to lead to negative attitudes toward the in-group that is the source of these threats, which may in turn result in extremist beliefs, an idea in line with existing research that draws clear links between such negative attitudes and stereotypes and prejudice.
Exposure to Racist Peers and Thrill-Seeking
To complete the model, two important mechanisms from (hate) crime literature are added to it in a third set of variables. We treat them as a third set of variables rather than integrating them in the logic set out above, as they can be considered to be nondomain specific variables, whereas the variables discussed above are domain specific insofar as they are consistently related to out-group hostility or intergroup dynamics. Thrill-seeking is an important dimension of low self-control, that is, the failure to consider the full range of consequences of one’s acts. Thrill-seekers tend to take decision at the spur of the moment, without considering the long-term consequences (Hirschi, 2004; Vazsonyi, Mikuška, & Kelley, 2017). Exposure to racist peers, in a similar fashion, constitutes a specific instance of social learning, that is, conformist transmission. This type of transmission, too, is a disposition all people are susceptible to given its evolutionary origins (e.g., Henrich & Boyd, 1998).
Thrill-Seeking
Research points out that thrill-seeking behavior is an important reason why people take part in antisocial behaviors directed to out-groups. For example, ethnographic studies have indicated that new members of right-wing extremist groups are often motivated out of opportunistic or thrill-seeking motives (Bjørgo, 2002; Watts, 2001). Although ideological motivations are important in understanding acts of politically motivated violence, ideology is not always crucial for entering extremist groups. The search of adventure, that is, thrill-seeking behavior, is one of the reasons often mentioned by (former) members of extremist groups. Thrill-seeking behavior also is a general predictor of violence: It is one of the most important components of low self-control.
Thus, the role of thrill-seeking behavior can be justified from several perspectives. The central assumption in Gottfredson and Hirschi’s (1990) General Theory of Crime is that low self-control increases the risk of offending, as well as other deviant and imprudent behaviors. Many studies have tested this proposition and empirical research shows that low self-control is associated with offending among different samples (e.g., youth, college students, adults, males vs. females, criminals) and in different designs (Burton, Cullen, Evans, Alarid, & Dunaway, 1998; Pratt & Cullen, 2000). Thrill-seeking behavior can be expected to be directly related to political violence, and indirectly through positive attitudes toward extremist beliefs and through exposure to racist peers. This is usually called a selection effect.
Exposure to Racist Peers
The causal role of peers is especially prominent in social learning theories (Akers, 1998; Bruinsma, 1992; Warr, 2002), but highly contested in control theories (Hirschi, 1969; Hirschi & Gottfredson, 1990; Kornhauser, 1978). As peer delinquency is one of the strongest predictors of self-reported delinquency, it is expected that this also applies to the study of political/ideological violence. Differential association with racist and/or delinquent peers provide two specific contexts of exposure to settings in which the use of violence either in general or for political reasons is supported. Differential associations are not only important in social learning theory, however, but also in routine activities/lifestyle theory (Laub & Sampson, 2003; Pauwels & Svensson, 2013). From a routine activities/lifestyle perspective, peers are important as they may be responsible for the situational instigation to commit an act of political violence. Previous studies have documented that exposure to racist peers is related to self-reported violence (Pauwels & De Waele, 2014; Pauwels & Schils, 2014). In the present study, we consider exposure to peer racism as important indicator of exposure to extremist moral settings, shaping the individual’s routines and risky lifestyle.
Right-Wing Extremist Beliefs and Political Violence
The above theoretical exposition on initial causes and mediating variables eventually gives rise to two outcome variables: right-wing extremist beliefs and political/ideological violence, the latter being the dependent variable of the model whereas the former can be regarded as an intermediate outcome. We call it an intermediate outcome, because right-wing extremist beliefs do not necessarily result in political violence, it can also result in a wide array of other actions such as terrorism and hate crime, or it can just exist on its own without necessarily implying a behavioral dimension.
The concept of right-wing extremist beliefs refers to the individual’s positive attitude toward the use of violence by right-wing extremist groups. Violent radicalization is often defined as the process whereby individuals acquire norms that are favorable to the use of violence used in a means-to-an-ends fashion (Borum, 2010, 2011). Right-wing extremist beliefs are defined as personal moral beliefs that favor the use of violence by right-wing extremists to obtain political goals. In our theoretical framework, right-wing extremist normative beliefs is a key mechanism by which perceived injustice, group threat, authoritarianism, feelings of superiority, Flemish identity, and ethnocentrism translate into political violence. A multitude of studies have found that measures of antisocial moral beliefs are significantly related to offending (Akers, 1998; Bottoms, 2002; Hirschi, 1969; Stams et al., 2006; Svensson, Pauwels, & Weerman, 2010) and political violence (Hagan, Merkens, & Boehnke, 1995; Pauwels & De Waele, 2014).
Hypotheses
To test the conceptual model that has been outlined above, a series of hypotheses are tested:
Hypothesis 1: Perceived injustice positively influences group threat, which in turn positively influences authoritarianism.
This hypothesis embodies the idea that when people perceive unfair treatment of their in-group, and especially when this injustice can be ascribed to a specific group (group threat), levels of authoritarianism will rise. For, authoritarianism is an explicitly threat-driven attitude.
Hypothesis 2: Authoritarianism has a positive effect on Flemish identity, ethnocentrism, and feelings of superiority.
Hypothesis 2 reflects a core idea of theorizing on RWA and social identity theory. First, higher levels of authoritarianism are expected to correlate with higher in-group identification (Flemish identity) and incline people to view the out-group in a negative way (ethnocentrism). Second, we hypothesize that people high in RWA will tend to favor a high distinctiveness of threatening groups, as this threat in itself reflects a non-compatible set of behaviors/values, which may be translated to feelings of superiority.
Hypothesis 3: Flemish identity and feelings of superiority have a positive effect on ethnocentrism.
The third hypothesis incorporates the ideas derived from the discussion on negative worldview. There, it was argued that both Flemish identity and feelings of superiority have a positive effect on ethnocentrism.
Hypothesis 4: Exposure to racist peers is positively influenced by ethnocentrism and thrill-seeking behaviors.
In Hypothesis 4, the important finding that thrill-seeking behavior is often associated with seeking the company of extremist/racist peers is incorporated, as well as the idea that holding negative views of a certain out-group may lead to people seeking out other people with similar views on that out-group. Regarding the latter, we argue that ethnocentrism is a mediating variable between feelings of superiority and Flemish identity on one hand, and exposure to racist peers on the other. This is because in ethnocentrism, a clear out-group is depicted as the source of the identity threats that underlie feelings of superiority and Flemish identity, and it is precisely those views on a specific out-group that may motivate one to seek the company of like-minded people regarding that out-group, but not necessarily the company of people holding similar beliefs of other out-groups.
Hypothesis 5: Right-wing extremist beliefs is positively influenced by Flemish identity, ethnocentrism, feelings of superiority, thrill-seeking behavior, and exposure to racist peers.
Largely in line with the perceived injustice model, we hypothesize that Flemish identity, ethnocentrism, feelings of superiority, thrill-seeking behavior, and exposure to racist peers have a positive effect on right-wing extremist beliefs, which is considered to be a positive attitude toward the use of violence on the basis of extremist views. Contra Hypothesis 4, the stress in extremist beliefs is on the antisocial aspect, not so much on the specific ideas about a specific out-group; for this reason, we hypothesize that it is more broadly influenced compared with exposure to racist peers.
Hypothesis 6: Right-wing extremist beliefs, thrill-seeking behavior, and exposure to racist peers have a positive effect on political violence.
In Hypothesis 6, the mechanism is completed. We hypothesize that the behavior-based index of political violence is positively influenced by tolerance/support for such acts (extremist beliefs), an urge for adventure (thrill-seeking behavior), and indirect influences of peer pressure (exposure to racist peers), much in line with existing theorizing.
Data
Data were collected through a web survey which was completed by young adults between the ages of 18 and 25. Web surveys are increasingly acknowledged as a valid and reliable tool for measuring self-reported delinquency, its data quality measuring up to those of paper and pencil studies (Lucia, Herrmann, & Killias, 2007). This is confirmed for studies targeting children in primary school (McCabe, Boyd, Young, Crawford, & Pope, 2005), youth in high school (Wang et al., 2005), and higher education (Miller et al., 2002). Two factors influencing the response rate, compared with paper and pencil studies, were considered:
Research population (Nulty, 2008). For certain groups, like students (our sample consisting for 95% out of students) or certain professionals, a survey can generate higher response rates than paper and pencil studies (Greenlaw & Brown-Welty, 2009; Kiernan, Kiernan, Oyler, & Gilles, 2005) because these groups are familiar with computer usage and the Internet is part of their daily life (Yetter & Capaccioli, 2010). This is also true for youth, the research population of our research.
Survey presentation (Shih & Fan, 2008). We presented the survey to respondents in a way that minimizes effort for completion. Invitation emails provide a direct link to the project’s Facebook page and the survey. Respondents only had to click to start and click again to submit the results. This means no saving of files, no mailing of questionnaires, no switches between paper and computer, and so on (Kiernan et al., 2005).
Some advantages of a web-based survey include the following: (a) costs involved are limited (Bethlehem, 2010), (b) errors in data-input are limited due to automation (Schmidt, 1997), and (c) the relative speed of data collection and storage compared with traditional paper and pencil surveys (Manfreda & Vehovar, 2008).
Although the possibility of distributing the questionnaire via online platforms or mailing lists has significantly contributed to the survey response, one must still have some reservations regarding the response: while web surveys seem to be increasingly popular in social science research, there are some questions left regarding the systematic bias that might result from exclusively using the world wide web as a sample frame: (a) response rate and (b) self-selection bias. Regarding the response rate, it can be said that it is impossible to estimate the actual response rate given the fact that the researchers cannot possibly know how many potential respondents were reached. However, as is shown, response rates are expected to be high when one focuses on student populations (e.g., Greenlaw & Brown-Welty, 2009). Regarding self-selection bias, efforts were taken to minimize nonparticipation in line with Nulty (2008). In this vein, (a) the survey was easily accessible through software packages, (b) appealing incentives such as a chance to win an iPod or cinema tickets were used, and (c) multiple reminders were posted on the survey’s Facebook page. This, taken together with the fact that the clear majority of respondents were students, should alleviate the concerns commonly raised against web surveys.
The survey was administered between December 2012 and April 2013 and resulted in a response of 723 respondents. In all, 37.3% of respondents were between 18 and 20 years old, 39.9% of respondents were between 20 and 22 years old, and 22.8% of respondents were between 22 and 25 years old. Most of those respondents were female (64.3%), student (94.7%), and either Catholic (45.6%) or atheist (47.3%). Among the students, the highest diploma obtained by respondents was one of general secondary education (56.8%), followed by a university degree (bachelor or master, 19.3%) and vocational training (14.3%). Only 0.4% (three respondents) were unemployed and 3.2% of the youngsters indicated that they had a job. Among the religious respondents, about half thinks religion is not important (45.9%), while an equal percentage finds religion moderately important. In total, 7.9% of religious respondents find religion highly important. Most religious respondents attend religious services once a year (35%) or twice a year (31.7%), while a considerable proportion of religious respondents never attend religious services (25.1%). Only a small percentage frequently attends religious services, once a month or more (8.2%). In terms of geographical spread, the whole region of Flanders was surveyed. The majority of people where from the eastern part of Flanders, with, respectively, 34.7% and 29.3% of the respondents derived from the province of Limburg and Antwerp. The other respondents live in one of the other three provinces, Flemish Brabant and Brussels Capital (10.1%), East Flanders (16.7%), and West Flanders (9.3%). A more detailed account of the study protocol can be found in De Waele (2015).
Measurement of Concepts
In the present study, numerous scale constructs were used to assess the relation between exogenous variables, mediators, and dependent variables. In view of the extensive nature of concepts used in the present empirical study, a brief overview of the scale constructs is presented.
Dependent Variable
Self-reported political violence was measured using the scale used by Gavray, Fournier, and Born (2012), De Waele and Pauwels (2016), and Pauwels and Schils (2016). Respondents were asked if they ever had done certain things, such as, for example, “vandalized anything in the street or at the public transport stations (e.g., bus stops, bicycles, streetlights, or something else),” “participated in a political action that was not allowed,” “thrown stones at the police during a demonstration?” “destroyed something on the streets because of your political or religious belief,” “damaged someone’s property because of your political or religious belief,” and “set something on fire because of your political or religious belief.” In the present study, we summarized all scale items and created a variety scale, which is common practice in juvenile delinquency research. Variety scales measure the number of different offenses that were reported.
Exogenous and Independent Variables
All exogenous variables were measured using 5-point Likert-type scales. All scales were standardized prior to analysis. Perceived injustice was measured using a scale translated from Doosje et al. (2012). The scale consisted of 12 items (minimum = 12; maximum = 60; M = 19.60; SD = 7.95) and had an alpha of .62. Group threat was measured using a 16-item scale (minimum = 26; maximum = 65; M = 43.95; SD = 6.64) translated from Doosje et al. (2012), with a Cronbach’s alpha for this measure of .76. Superiority was measured using a six-item scale (minimum = 7; maximum = 31; M = 12.98; SD = 4.78) translated from Doosje et al. (2012). Cronbach’s alpha for this measure is .76. Ethnocentrism was measured using a seven-item scale (minimum = 7; maximum = 35; M = 19; SD = 5.33) derived from Bircan (2012) and Hooghe, Vanhoutte, and Bircan (2009) and had a Cronbach’s alpha value of .87. Authoritarianism was assessed by means of a 10-item scale (minimum = 15; maximum = 56; M = 34.52; SD = 7.31) derived from Altemeyer (1988) with a Cronbach’s alpha of .92. Flemish identity was measured using a three-item scale (minimum = 3; maximum = 15; M = 9.38; SD = 3.24), translated from Doosje et al. (2012). Cronbach’s alpha for this measure is .83. Right-wing extremist beliefs was measured using a three-item scale (minimum = 3; maximum = 15; M = 4.66; SD = 2.51) translated from Doosje et al. (2012) with a Cronbach’s alpha of .87. Exposure to racist peers was assessed using a four-item scale (minimum = 4; maximum = 20; M = 10.10; SD = 1.52), derived and translated from Doosje et al. (2012) and had a Cronbach’s alpha of .85. Thrill-seeking behavior was measured with a three-item scale (minimum = −1.54; maximum = 3.21). Thrill-seeking is one of the major dimensions of low self-control in Gottfredson and Hirschi’s (1990) self-control theory and was measured using the three-item Thrill-Seeking subscale by Bursik and Grasmick (1993; minimum = 3; maximum = 18; M = 6.90; SD = 2.53). Cronbach’s alpha for this measure is .71.
Analysis Plan
To test the integrated theoretical model, a series of path analyses were run, using MPlus (Muthén & Muthén, 2012). The results are shown in Figure 2. Direct effects are presented. The relations between the interdependent scale variables were standardized before the analyses and presented through standardized path coefficients. To estimate mediation effects, the bootstrap procedure for SPSS as developed by Hayes (2013) was used (serial mediation with boot = 10,000 and a confidence level of 0.05. In the “Results” section, lower [LLCI] and upper [ULCI] levels of the confidence intervals are reported to indicate the significance of the indirect effects.)

Model resulting from SEM analysis.
Note. Maximum likelihood estimation was used. RMSEA for this model is 0.045, SRMR is 0.038, CFI is 0.975, which indicates a good model fit. Level of significance was set at 0.05 for all coefficients. SEM = structural equation model; RMSEA = root mean square error of approximation; SRMR = standardized root mean square residual; CFI = comparative fit index; RWA = right-wing authoritarianism; RW = right wing.
Results
Results will be discussed per hypothesis used to test the conceptual model. Hypothesis 1, stating that perceived injustice is directly and positively related to group threat, which in turn is positively and directly related to authoritarianism, is corroborated in the study. As conjectured, perceived group threat is in part determined by perceived injustice toward the in-group (β = .245). This finding is in line with ITT, as groups that act in an unjust manner toward the in-group can easily be seen as threatening toward the in-group, both in a realistic or symbolic way. In turn, group threat is directly and related to authoritarianism. The effect size of the regression parameter is strong (β = .591). From the standpoint of RWA theory, this is not surprising, given the fact that fear is assumed to play a key role in authoritarianism and that individuals displaying high levels of authoritarianism tend to see the world as an unsafe and threatening place. Analysis of indirect effects reveals that, indeed, the perception of injustice has a significant indirect and positive effect on RWA (β = .124, LLCI = 0.093; ULCI = 0.160), but no significant direct effect on the same variable. This bolsters the idea that a perception of injustice alone is not enough but that it needs to be attributed to a specific out-group to result in heightened levels of RWA.
Hypothesis 2 stated that authoritarianism is positively and directly related to ethnocentrism, Flemish identity, and feelings of superiority. This hypothesis is also corroborated. In line with the theoretical model outlined above, the perception of the world as threatening place, in which this threat originates in perceptions on out-groups, is strongly and directly related to identification with the Flemish community (β = .34), as well as ethnocentrism (β = .22) and feelings of superiority (β = .17). The findings that authoritarianism is positively related to both Flemish identity and feelings of (in-group) superiority can be explained by the fact that people who display higher levels of RWA tend to prefer clearly defined groups. A link can be made with social identity theory, insofar as threats to Flemish identity are closely related to distinctiveness threats and threats to in-group superiority can be regarded as group esteem threats. Regarding the latter, and in line with social identity theory, we argue that heightened levels of RWA may thus result in a more salient prestigious appreciation of the in-group, as people tend to identify with positively valued in-groups (e.g., Leach et al., 2003; Ouwerkerk et al., 2000).
In a similar vein, Hypothesis 3 stated that Flemish identity and feelings of superiority are positively related to ethnocentrism. Here, we only found a positive effect of Flemish identity on ethnocentrism (β = .17), but no significant effect of feelings of superiority on ethnocentrism. This suggests that negative feelings toward the out-group are only partially related to identification with the in-group, but not significantly related to the prestige one attaches to that in-group. Taking this reasoning further, perceived injustice attributed to a specific out-group (group threat) and a need for clearly defined groups (RWA) may result in ethnocentrism, and this effect is partially mediated by identification with the in-group (Flemish identity). When testing this particular indirect effect using the bootstrapping procedure, a small but significant indirect effect of injustice on ethnocentrism appears, which is mediated by group threat, RWA, and Flemish identity (β = .011, LLCI = 0.0071, ULCI = 0.0157). By contrast, the indirect effect of perceived injustice on ethnocentrism mediated by only group threat and authoritarianism is larger (β = 0.043, LLCI = 0.032, ULCI = 0.0584), suggesting that the additional mediation through Flemish identity is off less importance. Thus, Hypothesis 3 is only partly corroborated.
Hypothesis 4 relates to additional variables derived from self-control theory and hate crime literature that were added to the model. It states that exposure to racist peers is positively influenced by ethnocentrism and thrill-seeking behaviors. Both ethnocentrism and thrill-seeking have a positive effect on exposure to racist peers, with the effect of ethnocentrism being considerably stronger (β = .42) than the effect of thrill-seeking (β = .16). Often, scholars favor a “birds of a feather flock together” interpretation (Bjørgo, 1997, 2002; De Waele & Pauwels, 2016). This is logical from a theoretical point of view, given that ethnocentrism is operationalized as negative attitudes toward the out-group, and association with racist peers can result in an approval of these attitudes, thus heightening self-esteem. Furthermore, people tend to identify with positively valued groups or group-members, so if one has negative opinions of a specific out-group, identification with like-minded people is not at all surprising. Both explanations have been extensively tested by scholars investigating social identity theory, self-categorization theory, and self-control theory. Thrill-seeking and the accompanying search for adventure in itself has proven to be a salient predictor of joining extremist groups (Bjørgo, 2002; De Waele, 2015). In the criminological literature on troublesome youth group involvement, this search for adventure may explain self-selection: thrill-seekers select social environments with higher levels of exposure to racist peers.
Hypothesis 5 relates to the cluster of outcome variables, stating that right-wing extremist beliefs is positively related to Flemish identity, ethnocentrism, feelings of superiority, thrill-seeking behavior, and exposure to racist peers. Both thrill-seeking (β = .18) and exposure to racist peers (β = .12) have a positive effect on extremist beliefs. The positive effect of thrill-seeking on exposure to racist peers (β = .16) further suggests a partially mediated effect of thrill-seeking on extremist beliefs. When testing this mediated effect, a small yet significant effect of thrill-seeking through association with racist peers can be identified (β = .04, LLCI = 0.023, ULCI = 0.068). The positive effect of feelings of superiority (β = .15) and ethnocentrism (β = .26) on right-wing extremist beliefs is in line with social identity theory, as feelings of superiority may recalibrate moral beliefs, so that moral beliefs are in line with feelings of superiority. When in-group distinctiveness is low, which downplays the self-esteem derived from belonging to the in-group by making it less different or exclusive compared with the out-group, right-wing extremist beliefs can be a resultant response to restore this self-esteem. The fact that the effect of ethnocentrism is relatively larger in comparison with the effect of feelings of superiority bolsters this claim, as ethnocentrism is specifically located at the group level rather than the individual level, which plays a less obvious role in the etiology of group dynamics.
Hypothesis 6 focuses on the dependent variable, stating that right-wing extremist beliefs, thrill-seeking behavior, and exposure to racist peers are directly related to self-reported political violence. However, in our study, right-wing extremist beliefs had a direct and positive effect on political violence, but we could not find any direct effect of exposure to racist peers or thrill-seeking behavior on self-reported political violence. This suggests that the effects of both thrill-seeking and exposure to racist peers are entirely mediated by support for political violence. The absence of direct effects can be explained in terms of horizontal learning mechanisms. Social learning in the sense of horizontal transmission also relates to learning the customs and norms of the group, a quintessential element of group living. Therefore, it is no surprise that thrill-seekers, who do not believe political violence is an acceptable means to an end, will be less inclined to perform acts of political violence, while people can easily acquire such beliefs of acceptability while associating with like-minded peers.
Therefore, we also tested mediation effects. Our analysis there reveals that there is a small but significant indirect effect of thrill-seeking on political violence, mediated by support for political violence (β = .04, LLCI = 0.187, ULCI = 0.075), as well as a slightly larger indirect effect of exposure to racist peers on political violence, mediated by right-wing extremist beliefs (β = .06, LLCI = 0.024, ULCI = 0.099). Even though the hypothesis predicting direct effects of thrill-seeking and racist peers on political violence is falsified in the current study, this finding does highlight the major and important role beliefs that certain actions are justifiable play in the etiology of violence regarding both variables. In conclusion, Hypothesis 6 is partly corroborated, in the sense that support for right-wing violence, thrill-seeking, and association with racist peers do have a positive effect on political violence, be it that the influence of the latter two is mediated by support for political violence.
Conclusion
In this study, we integrated mechanisms from different theoretical traditions into one integrative framework, which was guided by the theoretical tenets of the dual process model and social identity theory and self-control theory. The study showed that, indeed, a cluster of mechanisms related to the dual process model (perceived injustice, perceptions of group threat, and RWA) had a significant impact on right-wing extremist beliefs and, by consequence, political violence. This effect, as predicted by social identity theory, was mediated by a set of mechanisms relating to in-group identity and prestige (identification with the Flemish community, ethnocentrism, and feelings of in-group superiority). Our findings thus lend support to the overall theoretical logic of the study, stating that perceptions of injustice may result in political violence if this injustice is attributed to an identifiable out-group and if social identity is salient. As an additional set of mechanisms derived from hate crime literature and criminological literature on extremism, thrill-seeking behaviors and association with racist peers were included, and had an indirect effect on political violence which was mediated by support for right-wing violence. In this sense, the study brings together mechanisms and insights from evolutionary psychology, social psychology, sociology, and criminology in one theoretical framework.
The current study contributes to current theorizing by explicitly relating different theoretical perspectives to each other, and may thus shed more light on what the entire mechanism leading up to political violence looks like. A proper explanation of a specific kind of behavior is the bedrock of an efficient preventive strategy. In our opinion, two main and interrelated cruxes in the generation of political violence appear. First, there is the importance of association with racist peers, along with high levels of in-group identification. It seems that preventive programs should explicitly incorporate this notion of socialization in their working, such as the program devised by Bjørgo (2002).
Second, the importance of a perception of injustice, along with that threat, should not be underestimated. The intricate mechanism leading up to extremism has its roots in these perceptions, and programs should be developed that incorporate this notion more explicitly. This type of program is most likely going to be one of a more indirect approach, for example, one incorporating the idea of superordinate goals (e.g., Sherif, 1966), but these types of program seem to be awarded only limited attention in dealing with extremism. Given that this can be perceived as the root cause of extremism, however, this lack of attention seems ill-founded.
Of course, the study has some limitations, relating to both the theoretical background, its testing, and its methodology. Regarding the theoretical background, future studies ought to include SDO in the model and focus on how this variable alters the dynamics in the model. SDO is the second main predictor in prejudice in Duckitt et al.’s dual process model, and is of a fundamentally different nature than the threat-driven RWA, as it is driven by competition. This may further refine the mechanism and reveal different, additional pathways to political violence. Second, future studies should focus on sex differences regarding the model. We did not discern between men and women in our analysis, but criminological literature indicates violent behaviors are disproportionately committed by males and that conceptions of masculinity play a vital role in violent behavior (e.g., Treadwell & Garland, 2011). Especially notions of masculinity may be of importance to the current model, given that social identity is one of the main theories it is based on.
Regarding the test of the model and the methodology, this theoretical framework can only account for a part of the variation of youth’s political violence in Flanders. The scope of the findings is thus limited to this spatiotemporal region, and cannot necessarily be generalized to other regions, where other social and cultural values and customs are observed. Future research can help to address this issue in generalizability, which may not only affect the findings of this study, but equally so the operationalization and measurement of the concepts used therein, as items that resonate well with a Flemish public do not necessarily resonate with other audiences, thus affecting the measurement model underlying this study.
Furthermore, the study is cross-sectional and therefore not optimal for making causal inferences as causes and effects are measured simultaneously. Finally, we need to consider that our results are based on a large-scale web survey. Given the potential bias this method entails—as does any method—cross-referencing the results with results from other types of studies, such as longitudinal and experimental designs, is warranted.

Co-host Mika Brzezinski noted: ""We are stepping up our efforts against this network and know there is still more to do."" You know what, if I could just say, they keep saying that. We know we have more to do. 
We know. We know. We're going to get better. They've been saying for five years that they know they have more work to do. The blog post continues. ""We know that our efforts will never completely eliminate the risk from this network or other dangerous organizations, but we will continue to remove content and accounts that break our rules so we can keep people safe.""Apparently that wasn't good enough for Scarborough: ""Well, didn't they already know -- did they just figure that out yesterday?"" He went on to demand that Congress take some unspecified action against tech companies: And I've got to say to Congress, I don't understand why Congress continues to allow people like Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg and Jack Dorsey to make billions and billions of dollars personally while keeping hate groups on their sites. Allowing them to fester and spread. They allow -- that man right there is responsible, more than anybody else in America, for the spread of hate speech and racism and misinformation about a pandemic that's killed 130,000 Americans. Zuckerberg is more responsible than anyone for hate speech and racism, seriously? Not Antifa members, not racists like Richard Spencer, the CEO of Facebook is worse? The question could also be turned around on Scarborough himself, why does MSNBC continue to pay him $8 million a year to spew hate against anyone he doesn't like?The anchor eventually revealed his true motive for slamming Zuckerberg -- revenge. Scarborough has convinced himself that Russian memes on Facebook stole the 2016 election on behalf of Donald Trump: And even now, the President of the United States is generating lies. To try to undermine our election. We know that foreign countries use Facebook first to interfere with American democracy and they do nothing about it! So, if you're Coca-Cola, like, why do you want to ever fund -- which, of course, they're not -- anti-semitism, racism against blacks? As you said, Holocaust deniers, giving them a platform, boogaloo deniers, giving them a platform. And up to this election, giving a platform to people trying to undermine the credibility of American democracy in this election. Zuckerberg is not the one that needs admonishing here, it is Scarborough, for continually engaging in his own misinformation and hate speech against people who he deems to be his political enemies.MSNBC's attack of Facebook was supported by Sleep Number [1]and USAA[2].Read the transcript below to learn more. MSNBC's Morning Joe 07/01/20 6:49 AMMIKA BRZEZINSKI:Facebook has taken its broadest action yet to fight hate crime on its site after yesterday it classified a large number of boogaloo movement accounts as dangerous and banned them. Facebook announced in a blog post that it has removed more than 300 boogaloo Facebook and Instagram accounts, 106 boogaloo groups, as well as 400 additional groups and 100 pages that host content supporting the movement. Facebook said they made the decision because the group, quote, actively promotes violence against civilians, law enforcement, and government officials and institutions.JOE SCARBOROUGH: Well, didn't they already know -- did they just figure that out yesterday?BRZEZINSKI: Yeah. ""We are stepping up our efforts against this network and know there is still more to do."" You know what, if I could just say, they keep saying that. We know we have more to do. We know. We know. We're going to get better. They've been saying for five years that they know they have more work to do. The blog post continues. ""We know that our efforts will never completely eliminate the risk from this network or other dangerous organizations, but we will continue to remove content and accounts that break our rules so we can keep people safe.""SCARBOROUGH: So, why do they know that they can never stop violent people who are racist, who want to kill black people and kill Jews and kill minorities? Why is it that you can never stop that from being on your social network? I don't understand, because, hell, The Washington Post,The New York Times,they don't let people that write racist things and call for the killing of police officers -- Oh, it's because you don't make enough money to police it. Oh, wait a second - You're worth $86 billion, Mark. And you're saying that you know there will always be hate groups and racist groups and bigoted groups and dangerous groups? And foreigners, people who are trying to interfere in our elections and you can't do anything, but here's a half measure? I don't get it. And I've got to say to Congress, I don't understand why Congress continues to allow people like Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg and Jack Dorsey to make billions and billions of dollars personally while keeping hate groups on their sites. Allowing them to fester and spread. They allow -- that man right there is responsible, more than anybody else in America, for the spread of hate speech and racism and misinformation about a pandemic that's killed 130,000 Americans. And for disinformation that is trying to rig the election, to actually undermine the American democracy. And he's doing a half measure, saying oh, we can't do anything about it.(...)7:00 a.m. EasternSCARBOROUGH: And you're so right, Jonathan. If you want just an example of how irresponsible Facebook has been and how irresponsible they continue to be, look at the fact that a federal official, law enforcement officer, was assassinated by a boogaloo boy, and it's taken them a couple of weeks to actually clean up those sites. You have -- I remember getting texts from friends talking about this ""Plandemic"" movie that was clearly, clearly a conspiracy theory that was causing real health concerns for doctors who also talked to me about it, saying they are creating a conspiracy theory that are making people believe this pandemic is nothing more than a George Soros-backed conspiracy plot. And they kept it up for months. It got more views than Taylor Swift videos, than Office reunions, but they kept it up. And even now, the President of the United States is generating lies. To try to undermine our election. We know that foreign countries use Facebook first to interfere with American democracy and they do nothing about it! So, if you're Coca-Cola, like, why do you want to ever fund -- which, of course, they're not -- anti-semitism, racism against blacks? As you said, Holocaust deniers, giving them a platform, boogaloo deniers, giving them a platform.

Two churches in Washington state were damaged by fire Sunday morning, and investigators suspect arson in one of the cases, numerous sources reported.
Police in Brewster are investigating a fire at New Testament Baptist Church, where firefighters were called at around 2:30 a.m. Sunday and discovered “quite a bit of fire to deal with,” according to the Blue Mountain Eagle.
The sanctuary of the church was heavily damaged, and the rest of the building sustained smoke and water damage. But around the time that firefighters had controlled the situation at the Baptist church, another call reportedly came in about a fire a few blocks away at Sacred Heart Catholic Church at 7 a.m.

Father Pedro Bautista, the pastor at Sacred Heart, said there was evidence that the fire was intentional, such as a broken window and a type of ignition device, according to the Spokesman Review. Investigators also have determined the fire at the Catholic Church to have been intentional.
The fire did not cause significant damage, to the surprise of authorities on the scene, according to Catholic News Agency. A chair, some carpet and a window were damaged, but Bautista said it was “divine intervention” that the fire did not spread further.
Bautista told CNA that the majority Hispanic parishioners at the church were frightened by the incident, and he didn't want rumors to spread throughout the community as an investigation into potential suspects was still ongoing. 
The two incidents follow numerous other attacks targeting churches, particularly Catholic parishes, across the country.
In late October, a man was reportedly arrested after allegedly severely vandalizing Saint Martin of Tours Church in Louisville, Kentucky.

A few weeks prior, the New York Police Department investigated vandalism at a Brooklyn church where a Virgin Mary statue had its hand cut off and was cracked along the head. In September, police in San Antonio investigated vandalism at a Catholic seminary where glass doors were struck and damaged, and a crucifix was desecrated.
The vandalism in San Antonio occurred a night before Republican Indiana Rep. Jim Banks called on the Department of Justice to investigate “increases in Catholic hate crimes and vandalism” in the United States. Incidents have included vandalism, arson, and attempted murder.

SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Hello and welcome to FOX NEWS @ NIGHT. I'm Shannon Bream in Washington, and we begin with a Fox News ""ALERT"".
In Democratic nominee Joe Biden's first interview since the convention, he lays down the law on exactly what measures he'll require Americans to take in the fight against COVID if he is elected.
Biden clearly is taking out a different approach to tackling the virus than President Trump, to supports targeted reopenings based on local conditions.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DAVID MUIR, ABC NEW ANCHOR: So, if the scientist say, shut it down --
JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I would shut it down. I would listen to the scientist.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BREAM: We'll have analysis on that straight-ahead. Plus, we're previewing the Republican National Convention. In just minutes, you're going to hear from one of the speakers, Mark McCloskey, the attorney from St. Louis, who is charged by a local prosecutor after he says he was trying to defend his home from a mob, when he and his wife stood outside with their guns.
But we begin with senior political correspondent Mike Emanuel on the latest in the race for the White House tonight. Good evening, Mike.
MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Shannon, good evening. A clear difference there on COVID policy with Joe Biden, saying he would shut down the country if that's what the experts suggest.
Today, President Trump blasted the Democratic convention for being a total downer.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The Democrats held the darkest and angriest and gloomiest convention in American history.
EMANUEL: The president also blasting his opponent, Joe Biden, and his fellow Democrats.
TRUMP: They want to punish American, its citizens instead of holding them high. Where Joe Biden sees American darkness, I see American greatness.
EMANUEL: In Biden's DNC speech last night, the Democratic nominee did not call out the president by name, but did go after him.
BIDEN: The current president has cloaked American darkness for much too long. Too much anger, too much fear, too much division.
EMANUEL: Biden is pledging to improve the lives of the American people.
BIDEN: Together we can and we'll rebuild our economy. And when we do, we'll not only build it back, we'll build it back better.
EMANUEL: President Trump, argues the economy is already recovering.
TRUMP: We call it a super V. It's no longer V, it's a super V, and they didn't think that could happen, and they are probably not happy about it.
EMANUEL: The president also laid out the differences between his 2016 and 2020 opponents.
TRUMP: Clinton's much smarter but not a likable person. Joe is not nearly as smart, but he's more likeable. So, you know, I don't know. Maybe I'd rather have the smarter person. Who cares about personality, right? But that's the difference.
EMANUEL: While Democrats try to show they are unified in purpose, a prominent progressive is signaling a fight over the heart and soul of the party is coming.
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT): But we're going to come together to defeat Trump. And the day after Biden is elected, we're going to have a serious debate about the future of this country. But it will be done within the framework of a Democratic society.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
EMANUELL: Tonight, a federal appeals court dealt President Trump a setback, refusing to provide immediate relief to stop his accounting records from being handed over to a New York state grand jury.
Instead, oral arguments are schedule for September 1st, over whether a subpoena of those records should be put on hold. Shannon?
BREAM: All right. Getting awfully close to Election Day. Now, Mike, we're also getting some breaking news tonight about former CIA director under the Obama administration John Brennan and the Durham investigation. What can you tell us?
EMANUEL: That's right. John Brennan's longtime colleague, Nick Shapiro, says Brennan was interviewed by John Durham related to Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
According to Nick Shapiro, Brennan was told by Durham that he is not a subject or a target of a criminal investigation, and that he is only a witness to events that are under review.
The interview was conducted at CIA headquarters. And I'm told it lasted eight hours. Brennan spoke about the efforts made by the intelligence community to ""understand and disrupt Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 election.""
I am told it's Brennan's fervent hope that the results of the Durham review will be apolitical and not influenced by personal or partisan agendas. Shannon.
BREAM: I think everyone should expect that. All right. Mike, thank you.
EMANUEL: You bet.
BREAM: Good to see you.
EMANUEL: Thank you.
BREAM: All right, new video tonight purportedly from a Portland neighborhood earlier this week of protesters marching through the streets and yelling profanities at residence.
ON SCREEN TEXT: Right here is another example of white men feeling comfortable.
BREAM: Well, Portland, just one of many democratically run cities that have been plagued with unrest and demonstrations that have often turned violent for weeks now in Portland.
ON SCREEN TEXT: Bet you you've never had a struggle in your life! Your flag does not represent justice and liberty for all.
BREAM: Correspondent Lauren Green brings us the latest developments from Chicago, in New York, and across the country tonight. Good evening, Lauren.
LAUREN GREEN, FOX EWS CHIEF RELIGION CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Shannon. Well, it is starting to look like another busy weekend in America's large urban areas. We're seeing a dramatic rise in violence, it was a bloody 12- hour span between Thursday night and Friday morning in New York City.
Local reports say 11 people were shot and two killed in Brooklyn and the Bronx. No arrests have been made in any of the shootings. It follows last weekend's string of shootings, and 39 shootings, and six deaths.
According to the NYPD, there have been 63 more homicides than the same time last year, a 30 percent increase and an 84 percent increase in the number of shootings year to date.
President Donald Trump has threatened to bring in federal law enforcement. Trump pointing out, the cities experiencing a barrage of violence and unrest are run by Democrats. Tweeting, ""The Democrats have to start enforcing law and order in their cities in states. New York City, Chicago, and Portland are total disasters.""
Meanwhile, the Windy City has been overwhelmed with looting spawned by bands of protesters. Shop owners reported smashed windows and destroyed or stolen property. Chicago officials ordered the bridges to the city's downtown area raised to prevent looting in the city center. And the unrest prompting the police chief to ban protesters from demonstrating outside Mayor Lori Lightfoot's home. And ordered anyone who refused to leave be arrested.
One neighbor frustrated with the heightened security, nicknamed it Fort Lori. But mayor is unapologetic.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
MAYOR LORI LIGHTFOOT (D-IL), CHICAGO: This is a different time like no other. And I'm not going to make any excuses for the fact that the given of threats that I have personally receive, given the threats to my home and my family, I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that they are protected.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
GREEN: A small amount -- a small group of city council members in Chicago wanted to declare a state of emergency and call in the National Guard. But Mayor Lightfoot and her allies delayed that decision and called for more discussion. Shannon.
BREAM: All right, Lauren Green for us tonight in New York. Thank you so much.
74 days until the election and the rising tide of violence along with a reluctance from the left to call it out specifically seems to be a growing issue even from some who say they've been staunch democratic voters.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And I will never vote for a Democrat again because what they're doing is disgusting. I'm still waiting for Democrats to condemn all the violence, all the violence. And instead, they're going on camera, appointed, elected people calling for more restlessness or up rest in the street.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BREAM: Our next guest has a message about law and order to share at the Republican National Convention next week, and he is already facing tough criticism for being there. So, let's talk about the shifting political landscape with St. Louis attorney and gun owner, Mark McCloskey. You remember the video well. Good to have you back on Fox, Mark.
MARK MCCLOSKEY, ST. LOUIS ATTORNEY AND GUN OWNER: Well, thanks for having me.
BREAM: Can you give us a quick update about your case, what you can can't say what position you guys are in now with regards to charges.
MCCLOSKEY: Well, we've been charged, we're -- if we plead next Monday on the -- not next Monday, but on the 31st, so, that will be the next stage in it. You know, since the Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner got re-elected, she won the primary and winning the Democrat primary in St. Louis as the same as a general election. So, we will deal with this.
And, of course, you know, our governor is up for re-election too, and so, our fate hangs in the balance of the election and the people of Saint Louis.
BREAM: OK. So, you are going to be speaking next week at the RNC and a lot of people think that is a bad idea for Republicans. I want to give you a chance to respond to your critics.
The Boston Globe says this, ""At the RNC, Trump will offer the strongest case against his reelection."" And that includes you, apparently. It's saying, ""Expect a GOP horror show with Trump as the ringleader of what will likely be an ugly spectacle of white grievance and culture wars. That Mark and Patricia McCloskey, the white St. Louis couple who brandished guns at Black Lives Matter protesters have been invited to speak at the RNC lays bare the path Trump has chosen."" How do you respond to that?
MCCLOSKEY: Well, once again, from the very beginning they call what we did a racial thing as a complete misrepresentation. What it is, is it protecting oneself against the mob. OK? The most basic right human beings have is a right of self-defense.
When the -- when the framers of our constitution and when the founders of our country put down the rights that we have, they weren't creating those rights, these are rights who are given us by God. These are our God-given rights to protect ourselves, our home, our families.
What the founders did was merely put down on paper the rights that we were given by God. It's not the government that gives us those rights. However, the other side, the leftists, the Democrats, their media allies, they wish to take those rights away for us. They wish to impose upon us government restrictions, make us, instead of free people under God, the servants of the leftist, you know, Marxist organization like Black Lives Matter.
BREAM: OK. Well, I know at one point, I think it was your attorney -- you're an attorney, your wife, I am too. I think that your attorney released a statement that you all were supportive of Black Lives Matter. Maybe you mean that small b, black lives matter, not the group, Black Lives Matter. Do you want to clarify that at this point?
MCCLOSKEY: Well, sure. You know, and I've been saying this since the beginning, what my (INAUDIBLE) earlier lawyer Albert Watkins was attempting to say was that we've always been champions of equal opportunity and equal rights under the law. We still believe that we always have. That has nothing to do with Black Lives Matter.
In the city of Saint Louis as of yesterday, I haven't checked the statistics today, 170 people murdered in the city of Saint Louis yesterday -- up until now. Out of a population of 300,000. That's essentially the exact same ratio as the number of people that have died of COVID virus in the United States compared to the population of the United States. It's a horrible thing in the city of St. Louis.
The background level of violence is remarkable and yet nobody seems to care. Those black lives -- don't seem to matter to anybody. And Black Lives Matter, it's not about blacks, and it's not about lives, it's a -- it's a Marxist organization that wants to transform the United States, remove our constitutional liberties, destroy our ability to protect ourselves, take our guns away, and make us servants of a -- of an all-powerful state.
And if you look at the Black Lives Matter web site, they make no bones about it. And it is shocking to me and it ought to be shocking I think to the entire country that major corporations, major sporting events like the NFL -- what? Going to give $250 million to an organization that is avowedly Marxist? Does that make sense to anybody?
And you see the violence in the streets, and you see, you know, people like that poor Adam Hainer, beaten when he was part of their organization. He said he's marched with Black Lives Matter. These people don't care about human rights, they don't care about people. What they want is power.
(CROSSTALK)
BREAM: Well --
MCCLOSKEY: What they want us to take over and --
(CROSSTALK)
BREAM: Yes, I think --
MCCLOSKEY: Go ahead, I'm sorry.
BREA: Yes. I would just say, I think for a lot of people, there is confusion and some frustration wanting to support the ideals of saying, black lives matter. And having differences from the group, particularly, as it's organized, and what its goals are. And as you said, their web site is, and people can check that out for themselves.
We'll watch for you next week at the RNC and we'll keep up to date on your plea and your hearing on the 31st as well. Mark McCloskey, thank you. Good to have you.
MCCLOSKEY: Thank you, Shannon.
BREAM: All right, the Democratic National Convention forced to go virtual because of the pandemic. Avoided potentially damaging infighting going public. That's happened before and will they put up a united front against the incumbent president?
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
JAMES MARTIN, JESUIT PRIEST: Our hearts to those most in need. The homeless person looking for a meal. The LGBT teen who was bullied, the unborn child in the womb.
BREAM: The Democratic National Convention ended virtually with a prayer for what the Jesuit Reverend James Martin called an almost forgotten constituency, the unborn.
MARTIN: Help us to be a nation where every life is sacred.
BREAM: But that was one of the few allusions to abortion during the entire four days by the dozens of speakers in prime time and the online caucus meetings.
KRISTEN DAY, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, DEMOCRATS FOR LIFE: I think the current plan platform is just way out of touch with, with regular Americans. So, they know that they have to downplay it right now if they're going to get these pro-life votes, because the pro-life votes are very upset with the platform right now.
BREAM: The pro-life advocacy group Democrats for Life of America coordinated multiple letters from religious leaders and elected officials to the platform committee, leading up to the convention to request a moderation in the language regarding abortion.
Democrats for Life also protested in Milwaukee, even though, practically nobody was there. Speeches took place remotely and delegates were asked to stay home.
DAY: Honestly, they -- I just don't think they believe -- they need our votes to win. And I think that's a mistake.
BREAM: A Fox News poll from June found that nearly a quarter of Democrats identify as pro-life, while a minority still a lot of votes. Life was a critical issue within the Democratic Party as recently as the sparring over Obamacare.
Allegiance to progressive stands on immigration and climate popped up even more recently in the campaign. But when they got to the virtual convention, the party focused on selling Joe Biden, and attacking President Trump, and avoiding hot button issues while watering down the platform to make it more palatable to moderates.
TEZLYN FIGARO, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: I mean, the moment that Bernie Sanders gave Joe Biden his endorsement.
SANDERS: We need Joe Biden as our next president.
FIGARO: That was when the establishment was given the legs up -- the leg up. It really wasn't about necessarily the DNC convention; it was about support from Bernie Sanders.
BREAM: Tezlyn Figaro worked for Senator Bernie Sanders' campaign four years ago.
FIGARO: You know, he has convinced his followers that it was a revolution. And so, they had a revolutionary mindset to believe that they would keep pushing the envelope until change was made. So, the convention was just a summary to be able to confirm that the progressive movement has pretty much been put on pause.
JULIAN CASTRO, FORMER HUD SECRETARY: Out of 35 primetime speakers, only had three Latinos in it. You know, and no Native Americans, no Muslim Americans.
BREAM: Progressive Latinos were also disappointed by what they saw as weak representation by their growing demographic.
REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): Good evening, bienvenidos.
BREAM: There was a marquee appearance by superstar Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, but it was only 90 seconds. An opinion writer complained on nbcnews.com. What it says to Latinos is that we must wait our turn, quietly, to have more than a token presence at the party's biggest party but vote for it unconditionally in the meantime.
FIGARO: There's diversity in America and I just don't believe that right now, that is what is selling. So, they have defaulted to say hey, you know, let's focus on getting President Trump out of office and then come back and have inner fight among ourselves as -- once Joe Biden is elected.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
BREAM: We will, by the way, have full coverage of the Republican National Convention next week, starting at our special time, midnight Eastern, right after the event's wrap up each night. Well, there are several major new wildfires burning in California taking lives and property and there seems to be a growing consensus that past policies are at least partly to blame. Rather than doing control burns in a state were much of the flora has evolved to depend on frequently naturally occurring fires, have to scale back, leading to a pile of dead and drying undergrowth, lots of it, according to experts.
The government accountability office reported late last year that fire suppression and other land management practices have disrupted the normal frequency of fires in many ecosystems. The altered landscape has contributed to larger and more severe wildfires. Scientific American says this, California's forests are even more vulnerable because more than 147 million drought-weakened trees have died statewide since 2010, leaving them primed to burn. Here's what President Trump said about it yesterday.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: Many, many years of leaves, broken trees, and they are like, so flammable, you touch them and it goes up. I've been telling them this now for three years. But they don't want to listen. The environment. The environment. But they have massive fires again in California.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BREAM: The latest GAO report says the number of acres needed -- needing controlled burns or other kinds of cleanup is now significantly larger and federal agencies can treat annually. Well, the pulpits and the pandemic, a church wins against COVID restrictions for now, as another California pastor is now facing jail time, maybe even a congregant to go there. Pastor John MacArthur from Grace Community Church and Joel Griffith, research fellow at Heritage, join us to talk about the latest COVID data, they're live, next.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BIDEN: I will be prepared to do whatever it takes to save lives because we cannot get the country moving until we control the virus. That is the fundamental flaw of this administration's thinking to begin with.
MUIR: So, if the scientists say, shut it down?
BIDEN: I would shut it down. I would listen to the scientists.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BREAM: Well, that is newly nominated democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden saying tonight, he'd be prepared to shut down America's economy altogether if scientists he trusts recommend doing that. So, let's talk about where we are tonight in the fight against the pandemic with the pastor of Grace Community Church in California, John MacArthur, who has been under fire for holding in-person services and economics research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, Joel Griffith, who is tracking a wide array of COVID data across the country. Welcome to you both.
JOEL GRIFFITH, RESEARCH FELLOW, HERITAGE FOUNDATION: Thanks for having us.
JOHN MACARTHUR, PASTOR, GRACE COMMUNITY CHURCH: Thank you, Shannon, good to be here.
BREAM: OK. So, Pastor, I know that you all have won a temporary part of what you're fighting, I -- my understand is that it's not over yet. And I want to read something also from a different church. This is Harvest Rock Church, they got a letter from the chief assistant city prosecutor in Pasadena, telling them this, your compliance with these orders, not holding services, is not discretionary, it's mandatory.
Any violations in the future will subject your church, owners, administrators, operators, staff and parishioners to the above-mentioned criminal penalties which, by the way, include jail time and fines, as well as the potential closure of your church. Pastor, what's the update on what you guys are facing there in California?
MACARTHUR: Well, from the standpoint of the police and arrests, I've been told personally by the authorities of the police department that there's no scenario that they can even imagine in which they would come and close down Grace Community Church and put anybody in jail because they enforce the law and health mandates and governor's mandates don't constitute law. So, we are not expecting that, but that doesn't mean they don't continue to attack us.
They attack our constitutionally protected right to worship together, even with low, low COVID numbers at this particular point. And they drag us into court. Monday will be the fourth time we have gone to court.
BREAM: Right. And I know for this one church that got the threatening letter about jail time, not only for the pastor but for the congregants, they are doing social distancing, masks, and all kinds of other things, taking temperatures when you come in. And I know every church is handling this in a different way. OK. I want to ask you, Joel, about -- first of all, I want to put up a map that you guys are tracking areas to see what the death toll trend is, and it's really cool, people can click on it, you can try to find your own county. You're doing county by county.
And I want to put up together -- put up some of the things that you have found. You say just 1 percent of the counties in the U.S. representing 17 percent of the population are responsible for almost half of the country's COVID-19 deaths. Overall, only about 10 percent of the counties in the U.S. contain 90 percent of all the COVID-19 deaths even though those counties include 60 percent of the population. I find that very interesting and surprising. And listen, I've been covering this thing for months. Were you surprised by anything that you guys uncovered in the data?
GRIFFITH: Yes. The -- I think the -- we are really trying to help the country see what the pundits elsewhere aren't telling them. That's -- this is a very concentrated virus. We know that more than half of all counties actually have five or fewer deaths. And like you pointed out just now, a lot of these deaths that we have are focused on 30 counties, that's 1 percent of all counties that stretch from Philadelphia up to Boston. You know, we see people as a result tonight with Vice President Biden suggesting that we should go into a nationwide economic shutdown.
Based on this data, it simply makes no sense to subject citizens in places like Indiana, South Dakota or Arkansas, to these absolutely disastrous restrictions that we see in New York City.
BREAM: OK. And again, cool interactive page, people can see the data for themselves at Heritage. Pastor, there are those who think, your church, why you continue to meet, should be doing more as far as masks, social distancing, that kind of thing. And under the headline, California church defies public health orders and they say churches obey all kinds of government guidelines from fire codes to maximum occupancy limits.
Surely trying to contain pandemic falls within that category and is not a new government overreach or attempt to shutdown churches, other evangelicals have argued. What do you say?
MACARTHUR: Well, first of all, none of those normal government mandates and designs for the safety of people in general, tell us we can't worship, we can't go to church and worship. And none of them tell us we can't sing, we can't fellowship, we can't shake hands, specifically we can't hug. They're so onerous that we couldn't possibly meet under those rules. And again, our people get it, 99.99 percent of the people in California have no lasting impact from COVID.
The health director out here said the other day there's one COVID-related death per 100,000 at this particular time. We have 7,000 people in our church. We don't know anyone that's sick and no one has been in the hospital with this.
BREAM: OK. Well, we know you'll continue your services on Sunday. You're back in court next week. We'll track that. Pastor and Joel, thank you both for coming on.
MACARTHUR: Thank you.
GRIFFITH: Thank you, Shannon.
BREAM: OK. The Russian dissidents, still in a coma, being taken to Germany for further medical treatment. Supporters of Alexei Navalny, a leading critic of Vladimir Putin, say he drank tea laced with poison and that Kremlin is behind both his illness and the 24-hour delay in transferring him to a top German hospital. Russian doctors say there's no evidence of poisoning and the Kremlin denies, trying to prevent the transfer from happening.
Ok. Can a university, force students to download an app that tracks their every move in order to stop the spread of COVID? ""NIGHT COURT"" convenes, next. You're the jury.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't want to spend 14 weeks locked in a 4.5-mile radius and not be able to work or see friends and family outside of here.
BREAM: Three major groups of wild fires are raging across California tonight as the Golden State also suffers from a record-breaking heat wave.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, it's stifling hot. It's terrible, obviously. You know, it's just really uncomfortable, difficult to sleep.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BREAM: And if that wasn't tough enough, California residents are experiencing rolling blackouts this month with some lawmakers there saying the state's push to rely on green energy could be to blame. Correspondent Leland Vittert is digging and taking a look for us tonight.
LELAND VITTERT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: And Shannon, good evening to you. Mother nature is challenging California's dedication to green energy. And while the governor is pledging to continue the promise of being green by 2045, a lot of Californians just want things from 1945 like air conditioning, lights, and electricity for the refrigerators to keep their food from spoiling.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We tried to sleep in the backyard, and of course, we had a little thunderstorm on Saturday night which didn't help anything at all. So, it was just sweat and grin and bear it.
VITTERT: The heatwave settled over the Western United States pushing power plants to their max. But California's grid faces a unique challenge. Environmental restrictions on coal, nuclear, gas plants are meant to achieve the green dream of fully renewable energy by 2045. But despite the boiling sun, the state solar and wind plants aren't enough. And in that record heat and California's neighbors don't have enough power capacity to share. The bottom line, is people don't want the lights to go down, Former Governor Gray Davis explained to Politico. People also want a carbon-free future. Sometimes, those two aspirations come into conflict. Current Governor Gavin Newsom has made his choice.
GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA): We are committed to low carbon green future. We are going to radically change the way we produce and consume energy for one reason: we believe in climate change.
VITTERT: Back to the ordinary Californians, their lives are radically changing right now.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have no power, I have no Internet, so they can't do their schooling from our house, so they have to stay somewhere else until we get power back.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
VITTERT: Perhaps said a different way, a majority of consumers want clean energy but they wanted reliably and affordably. During this heat wave it was neither -- a warning state critics of a sweeping Green New Deal, which rejects natural gas is a bridge fuel until experts solve the challenge of storing the clean energy whenever the wind and solar systems create it.
BREAM: OK. Leland, thank you. Time now for ""NIGHT COURT."" After 20 students at Albion College were caught in an off-campus party, the private Michigan school imposing tough new measures as it welcomes students back to campus. Among them, not allowing students to leave campus and requiring students to download an app that will track their locations around the clock, leading some students to say: ""we feel like prisoners."" So, let's discuss with Michigan Top Radio Host, Steve Gruber, and Washington Times Legal Affairs Reporter and Attorney, Alex Swoyer, good to have you both.
STEVE GRUBER, RADIO HOST: Good to be here.
ALEX SWOYER, LEGAL AFFAIRS REPORTER, WASHINGTON TIMES: Hey, Shannon.
BREAM: OK. So, I want to start with part of a statement from Albion's president. He says, ""The purpose of tracking students is to manage risk and not limit movement, location data will only be accessed if there's a positive test result for the purposes of contract tracing or in the event of an unauthorized departure from campus for the purposes of managing risk of exposure."" All right, Steve, I imagine you're getting an ear full about this on the radio up there.
GRUBER: Well, we certainly are and let's talk about this. The students have to stay on this 4.5-mile radius. They're not allowed to leave. They have to sign a contract or they can't come to school at all. Now, if they violate that, like the 20 kids who were out playing beer pong, smoking weed, sharing pizza -- shocking, right, for a college student to do such things.
They're facing some severe penalties. Failure to comply, putting life of others in danger they're being told, is going through a judicial process at the school there. But what is really telling you, if it's about the safety of the students, this part is very unusual, the faculty and the staff, they can leave at will. It's the students that are locked down. Now, how does that make any sense to anyone?
BREAM: Well, and we have one of the students who talked to us, Hayden Baker, who addresses that point. Let's hear from him.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
HAYDEN BAKER, ALBION COLLEGE SENIOR: They're trying to create this bubble, but when faculty and staff can go home and go about their lives regularly and we can't, then it's kind of defeating the purpose of that bubble.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BREAM: What about that, Alex?
SWOYER: I think that presents a crack in their argument. Of course, you can see schools, this is something Mitch McConnell spoke about on Capitol Hill about wanting some sort of liability protection. I'm sure they're trying to protect themselves from a massive outbreak in being sued and liable for that. So, you can see some legal interests there. However, I do think the students could possibly look at toward law an invasion of privacy claims. I saw that the app tracks them every 10 minutes. That seems, I think, a reasonable person would say that's an intrusion.
BREAM: OK.
GRUBER: It certainly does.
BREAM: And one of the problems that the students have had, too, is that they work off-campus, a lot of them, and Hayden was ones you heard from earlier who said, like, I need a job to pay my way through school. Here's what they say about the safety guidelines: ""Students should not work off- campus. This policy will operate on the honor system. Students who wish to take classes in person and participate an on-campus activity but need to work, should work on campus."" Now, Steve, I don't know how many jobs there are to go around but that's their solution.
GRUBER: Well, the solution is to offer them jobless contract tracers, that's the solution. You can't leave campus to see a relative, you can't see -- leave campus to see the doctor, you can't go get groceries, all of those things will be brought to you. Now, you can get a special permit to leave campus, potentially, but you have to go through the process. And I want to address what Alex had to say, you know, I think there's a breach of contract.
You see, it cost $62,500 a year to go to Albion, and the kids all signed a contract to go there but the school offers many students $20,000-$30,000 a year if you signed a four-year deal. So, what you have is a breach of contract, a promissory, a stopple of violation of the contract because these kids were promised a college experience. They want to be in the dorms, they want to part of the social events, they want to go to class, they want to go to football games and basketball games.
They are being denied the college experience. Can you imagine? You guys went to college. It's like a prison camp. The guards, professors, they go home every day. The kids, back to your cell because you're not allowed to leave campus. Can you imagine what the experience would be like especially for a senior like Hayden Baker that we just heard from.
BREAM: Yes, that is trying to work his way off-campus to help pay his way through. All right, Steve and Alex, thank you very much. And I love to hear from our viewers because I think this is going to a very interesting conversation. Use the #NightCourt and @ShannonBream or @FoxNewsNight and tell us what you think. Thank you, both.
GRUBER: Thank you.
SWOYER: Thanks.
BREAM: OK. Two incidents of racist graffiti complete with the news and the n-word in a peaceful upscale suburb near the nation's capital. But once the arrest was actually made, local authorities failed to reveal the suspect is black. FOX NEWS @ NIGHT investigates hate crime hoaxes, are you on the rise? That's next.
BREAM: A political candidate in Sumter, South Carolina along with an associate charged with faking her own kidnapping and beating. Sabrina Belcher allegedly staged the fake crime in an attempt to garner publicity and sympathy and ultimately, votes, in the next election. Our next guest digs into cases much like this one in his book, ""Hate Crime Hoax,"" Kentucky State Professor, Dr. Wilfred Reilly joins us. Good to have you, sir.
DR. WILFRED REILLY, PROFESSOR, KENTUCKY STATE: Good to be here.
BREAM: OK, so this was the reaction from the police. They say, ""This was simply an effort to create disorder and discontent in our community for personal gain. As a result, a valuable number of resources including personnel, man-hours at the police department, as well as local medical professionals were wasted based on false information."" What do you make of this case out of South Carolina?
REILLY: Well, I think this is a uniquely bizarre case, but quite frankly, false or dubious, hate crime allegations are nothing new. Obviously, if someone makes, if you will, ordinary hate crime claim: they were beaten up outside a country bar or a tough African-American club at closing time, that's very, very likely to be true.
But when we look at the most high-profile allegations of this in the recent past, Jussie Smollett, Bubba Wallace, Yasmin (INAUDIBLE), Covington Catholic, Air Force Academy, Eastern Michigan, Drake University, Duke Lacrosse, it wouldn't be hard at all to go on.
Those have, in fact, all collapsed. And there's interesting questions about the motivation of people involved in the incidents, why these so often happen on the campus or in the political sphere. But yes, a strange case but something we've seen before.
BREAM: OK. I want to point to another case here that happened in Bethesda, an up-scale school, you know very nice suburb outside of D.C. here, where there were a couple of incidents. Graffiti, racist in nature that was perpetrated on a local school here, again a very nice school. There's an attorney who is now involved in defending one of the kids who got in trouble but he says this, he says: ""At Walt Whitman High School, one of American's top 100 public high schools, students and faculty imagine white- hooded riders racing through the tidy house after two incidents of lynching graffiti, complete with a noose and the N-word.""
He goes on to say, ""But nobody told the people of Bethesda was that the graffiti painter of both Whitman incidents was African-American."" He says the other students that he is defending and this did not know what was going to go down. But he said, I think that's important for the community that's been so worried that there was a race problem with this graffiti to find out that the perpetrator actually and, I think, the police quote him as saying something like: ""oh, I just thought it would be interesting, given the current environment to, you know, gin up some news.""
REILLY: Yes, the thing that remarkable about that is that incident itself was widely publicized but no one mentioned that the person responsible for things like the news found on the campus himself happened to be a black guy. One thing that I do find putting together the book ""Hate Book Hoax"" is that symbols of sort of the prejudiced past, actual KKK regalia, actual nooses are these days very often associated with hate crime hoaxes as well as or instead of with actual hate crimes.
We saw this at Oberlin College, we saw this at Wisconsin Parkside where nooses and list of ""death threats"" were found throughout campus. And again, it seems like this has happened in this pleasant suburban environment. On the one hand, it's a very good thing that the Klan isn't active on the campus. On the other hand, I don't think that's entirely surprising.
BREAM: OK. Super quickly before we're out of time, are you worried about the impact it has on people who are victims of legit hate crimes? Quickly.
REILLY: Yes. Yes, absolutely. The primary victims of individuals who falsify crimes are the actual victims of crimes with hate crime, obviously, as with sexual assault and any other category of crime there's many, many real incidents. People who falsify them in this matter take away from those who actually had that terrible experience.
BREAM: Dr. Reilly, an interesting conversation and interesting book. We appreciate your time.
REILLY: Thank you.

BREAM: President doubling down on his argument that vote by mail is right for fraud. As the Postmaster General took a grilling in the Senate today, Democrat say they're worried the postal service won't be able to handle mail-in voting to the pandemic. Well, they get some answers today. Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram taking a closer look for us tonight. Good evening, Chad.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Shannon, Louis DeJoy testifies on Monday before the House Oversight Committee. But Senate Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson views that panel as ""hostile."" So, Johnson called DeJoy earlier as a preemptive strike.
SEN. RON JOHNSON (R-WI): There's a lot of fiction and a lot of false narrative agendas.
PERGRAM: Democrats charged DeJoy wants to tilt the field toward the president curtailing vote by mail, but in fact the joint it encourages mail in voting.
LOUIS DEJOY, U.S. POSTMASTER GENERAL: The Postal Service will deliver every ballot and process every ballot in time, that I receive.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: New support voting by mail.
PERGRAM: Joining the president, he might not be on the same page.
TRUMP: We'll have double voting, where they send in a balloon then they got to be invert. problem.
SEN. GARY PETERS (D-MI): Did you discuss those changes are there a potential impact on the November election with the president. I
DEJOY: I have never spoken to the President Service. But moving forward: shine to any negative impact on the election is now an outrageous claim.
PERGRAM: The postal Service sent warnings to 46 states that delivery delays could leave ballots uncounted but DeJoy says a similar notice went out in 2016.
DEJOY: There has been no changes in any policies with regard to election mail for the 2020 election.
PERGRAM: President Trump says mail-in voting creates chaos.
TRUMP: You know, it's a theory, if you don't have the end of the year, the crazy Nancy Pelosi would become president and you know that, right?
PERGRAM: That's not entirely true. It presumes Nancy Pelosi reelected a speaker next year and also ignores the fact that the House in the Senate convene in the joint session of congress in January to ratify the Electoral College. If Congress can sort out the Electoral College the house decides whose president V.A. a contingent election. Each delegation casts one ballot. If been too contingent elections, 1800 electing Thomas Jefferson, and 1824, electing John Quincy Adams. Shannon.

63,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1251/Files (250).DOCX","Newstex Blogs",2020-11-16,"5371 words",NA,"Ian",NA,"11/16 Links Pt2: Democrats, Media Stand On The Graves Of European Jews To Hit Trump; Israel demands Amanpour apologize for comparing Kristallnacht and Trump",FALSE,"Nov 16, 2020( Elder of Ziyon: http://elderofziyon.blogspot.com Delivered by Newstex) From Ian: Democrats, Media Stand On The Graves Of European Jews To Hit Trump[1] To even consider using Kristallnacht in the same sentence as Donald Trump, let alone in an attempt to compare Trump to the Nazi Party, is to stand on the ashes of European Jewry. Hitler and the Nazi Party openly acted upon their expressed desire to eradicate the Jewish people. Given that the Trump administration has yet to discriminate against Jews in any manner, when Amanpour said 'after four years of a modern-day assault on those same values,' what exactly does she mean? Donald Trump and the Republican Party do not have an official paramilitary wing, and any relevant policies during Trump's first term have been overwhelmingly pro-Jewish and pro-Israel. 
When it comes to the targeting of Jewish businesses, homes, or places of worship, there are certainly anti-Semites on the radical wings of both sides, but the mainstream implicit endorsement of such actions are unique to one side of the political spectrum, and it's not the political Right. After all, it was not a Republican who used the same rhetoric of 'hypnosis' and 'wealth' when condemning the 'evil doings' of the Jewish state. It was not a Republican who supported the boycott of Jewish businesses. It was not a Republican who endorsed a one-state solution which would result in the expulsion or mass murder of millions of Israeli Jews. So, we must conclude that Amanpour is using one of the darkest moments in Jewish history as a proxy to describe a supposed attack on some unknown set of 'values' which Biden and Harris will somehow defend and prevent. For her, the suffering of Jews is a disposable weapon which can be wielded in pursuit of Leftism and the Democratic Party. It doesn't matter that it is the mainstream Left who are burning books. It doesn't matter that it is the mainstream Left who wish to actively enable nations who have called for the destruction of the Jewish State. And it doesn't matter that it is the mainstream Left who are using the very same language which fueled Kristallnacht and the Holocaust.Israel demands Amanpour apologize for comparing Kristallnacht and Trump[2]Israeli Consul-General in Atlanta Anat Sultan-Dadon wrote a letter to CNN executive vice president Rick Davis, obtained by The Jerusalem Post on the condition that it not be quoted. The letter, sent two days after Amanpour's remarks, explained that the Nazis murdered at least 90 Jews on Kristallnacht. They also arrested over 30,000 Jews and deported them to concentration camps. The night of Kristallnacht was the opening chapter of the Holocaust. The consul-general expressed outrage at Amanpour's use of the Holocaust for political means, and said it disrespects those who perished. Amanpour's statements set off an immediate backlash on Twitter. Former Israeli consul-general in New York Danny Dayan tweeted that 'the foolish comparison Amanpour made between Kristallnacht and Trump must bring about her immediate dismissal from CNN. There is no immunity for Holocaust deniers.' White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany called Amanpour's remarks ""despicable,"" and said the CNN anchor ""must apologize for trivializing the Holocaust &#38; the tragic genocide of millions of Jews. ""They must also apologize for slandering the most pro-Israel President in history,"" she said. 2. Amanpour has thrived because her hatred for the Jewish state is considered ""sophisticated"" in her little, sick bubble of Western elitists who have spent the past 70 years pretending that anyone could have been Nazis -- especially the Jews. This erases Germany's culpability..3 — Caroline Glick (@CarolineGlick) November 16, 2020[3] Israel to send second astronaut into space[4]In about a year, Israel will send its second astronaut into space. Former fighter pilot Eytan Stibbe will be trained in the United States, Germany and Russia before taking off from Florida in December 2021 for a 200-hour stay on the International Space Station (ISS). This mission will be the first to the ISS manned entirely by private astronauts. Stibbe is donating his time and all costs of the journey, including expenses related to the experiments to be chosen for him to bring into space designed by Israeli scientists, entrepreneurs and students. The announcement was made today at the President's Residence in Jerusalem by the Ramon Foundation, the Israel Space Agency and the Israeli Ministry of Science and Technology. Ran Livne, CEO of the foundation, will lead the project. He plans on special broadcasts from the space mission for Israeli children, including dozens of demonstrations, experiments and live calls from the ISS with schoolchildren across the country. Israel's first astronaut, Ilan Ramon, died in the explosion of the Space Shuttle Columbia in February 2003. Receiving his pilot wings in 1978, Stibbe flew under Ramon's command in the 117 F-16 squadron. Ramon's son Tal said that Stibbe 'and his family escorted us through the years through everything we went through, the good and the bad, and their family has become our family.'https://www.jewishpress .com/wp-content/uploads/Jewish-Astronaut-696x492.jpg ;Growing Peace in the Middle East[5]American Jews can help Israel and the entire region by strengthening the Abraham Accord. And please, come visit us. For the UAE and Israel, the benefits of the accord are straightforward. The two countries have never been in a state of active hostility, so there is none of the baggage that attends other Arab-Israeli interactions. We expect to see substantial mutual gains quickly, in a number of areas, from health care to agritech and tourism. Once the accord was signed, we started working with our Israeli counterparts to meet the enthusiastic demand by young people to see what life is like 'on the other side.' There has been a lot of interest on the part of Israeli and Emirati students and academics in studying and teaching in the other country. One initiative that is coming together now is a UAE-Israel Youth Circle, bringing young professionals together in the arts, literature, diplomacy, science, to share ideas and make connections. Israel and the UAE have so many complementary interests and strengths, that the possibilities for action and innovation really are endless, and exciting. We expect these connections to grow and evolve quickly, in step with the number of people traveling to the other country for business and tourism. This will be made infinitely easier by 28 weekly direct flights between Tel Aviv and Dubai and Abu Dhabi. We are looking into other ideas, including the construction of platforms for collaborative action, where Arabs and Jews (and others) can meet and share ideas, and start new initiatives and businesses. We want the youth of the entire region to imagine how this widening diplomatic space can open doors for them. It is essential that the Palestinians see the concrete benefits from the accord. While the task of peacemaking is up to the Israelis and Palestinians, we in the United Arab Emirates will continue to do what we can to support the process. We have seen proposals already from various groups and individuals with ideas about how to bring Israelis and Palestinians closer together through creative logistics solutions, virtual education, and collaborative opportunities for Palestinian and Israeli women in tech, and more. Last but certainly not least, we believe there is a place for the Jewish and Arab diasporas in this process. These are dynamic populations with world-class skills who care about the future of the region, and have influence in their own countries. We extend a very warm welcome in particular to the American Jewish community and hope more will come to visit us in the United Arab Emirates, which is home to a growing and dynamic Jewish community.JNS top 40 global advocates for Israel online[6]In this day and age, the State of Israel is fighting on multiple battlefronts, none more so important than online. Whether it be Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram or TikTok, battles of the narrative are being waged, anti-Semitism is spreading, and extremist forces are seeking to undermine efforts towards peace. In compiling this list, which is by no means exhaustive (or ranked), JNS has sought to include individuals from all walks of life, from around the world, and both Jews and non-Jews alike. Each of these inspiring leaders has two things in common: He or she is making a real difference, and is a fearless and tireless advocate for the Jewish state. Dave Collier (@mishtal)Dave Collier is a British investigative journalist who has uncovered a wealth of news-breaking stories on Jeremy Corbyn and anti-Semitism in the British Labour Party, as well as Islamist groups in the United Kingdom. Michal Cotler-Wunsh (@CotlerWunsh)In the short space of a few months, Michal Cotler-Wunsh, a Knesset member for the Blue and White Party and one of Israel's top international law experts, has become the leading voice in the Knesset making the case for Israel and fighting online anti-Semitism. Hillel Neuer (@HillelNeuer)Hillel Neuer of UN Watch is a man who makes tyrants and dictators nervous every time he comes up to the microphone at the U.N . Human Rights Council in Geneva, holding the world body to account and fearlessly standing up for the State of Israel, while also championing the oppressed. Arsen Ostrovsky (@Ostrov_A)Arsen Ostrovsky is a leading pro-Israel voice online with a regular monthly Twitter reach of more than 8 million users. Earlier this year at the Knesset, he single-handedly took Twitter to task for continuing to give a platform to Iranian leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.Poll : Most Arabs Don't View Israel as Greatest Threat (PDF)[7]According to the Arab Opinion Index (2019-2020), published in October, 51% in Jordan and 48% in Lebanon see Israel as the greatest threat to their country, while only 25% in Egypt, 24% in Sudan, and 23% in Kuwait agree. 50% in Iraq, 29% in Saudi Arabia, and 34% in Kuwait see Iran as the greatest threat. 61% in Algeria see France as the greatest threat. Overall, the number of those who say Israel poses the greatest threat to the Arab countries has fallen from 52% in 2012-13 to 37% in 2019-20. 88% of Arabs disapprove of recognition of Israel by their home countries. Saudi Arabia was the country with the lowest level of disapproval of recognition - 65%, while 6% approved, and 29% did not answer. The 2020 Presidential Election: How Jewish-Americans Voted[8]A study of 540 Jewish-American respondents after Election Day looked at the role Jewish identity played and asked about ""pro-Israel"" attitudes. We also looked at which issues played a role in determining how Jewish-Americans voted. When asked, ""Would you consider yourself definitely ""pro-Israel""?, a majority had no problem saying ""yes"" (over 57%), while only 5% said ""no."" 37% preferred the choice: ""The term is too vague for me to give a 'yes' or 'no' answer."" Among Trump voters, 87% said they were definitely ""pro-Israel,"" with 1% saying ""no"" and 12% saying ""the term is too vague."" Among Biden voters, 52% said they were definitely ""pro-Israel,"" with 6% saying ""no"" and 42% saying ""the term is too vague."" Fully half of our sample said their Jewish identity did not figure at all into their choice for president. While the other half did say it had an impact, only 13% said it figured a ""great deal,"" and only 8% said it figured ""a lot."" In this particular election, Israel took a back seat to something else. When asked which were the ""most important"" issues in choosing a president, 59% chose ""character and trust."" When asked about the ""second most important issue,"" respondents chose Covid-19, climate change, the economy, and health care (in that order). It appears that many Jewish-Americans are increasingly more concerned about the principle and substance of certain issues as related to their personal ideology and party affiliation and are less inclined to apply identity-based labels such as ""pro-Israel"" to describe themselves or define their behavior.Eli Lake: The Pro-Israel Progressive Movement Notches a Win[9]Ritchie Torres, a gay Afro-Latino Democrat from the Bronx, will join Congress next year as a charter member of what might be called the anti-anti-Israel caucus. Not only did Torres win without the help of the police union or the institutional left, but he also won despite opponents who tried to paint him as a pawn of the Jewish state. Whereas many progressive Democrats are wary of bucking their party's left flank on Israel, Torres is not. 'The progressive position is to promote a Jewish state and a Palestinian state, not to end the existence of Israel as a Jewish state,' he told me. Torres stands in contrast to Democrats such as Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who last year accused her fellow members of Congress of being more loyal to Israel than to the U.S. Some Democrats initially sought to censure Omar. But in March the Democrat-controlled House failed to pass a resolution formally condemning Omar for her remarks. In that moment, it was fair to say the Democratic Party had turned a corner. The majority of its members remain supporters of the U.S.-Israel alliance. But after the vote, the party's tent widened to include representatives who sought to portray Israel as a toxic and apartheid state. Now it's possible that Democrats are turning a corner again. For Torres, the journey began with a trip to Israel in 2015 sponsored by the Jewish Community Relations Council of New York. Organizations that support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanction (BDS) movement against Israel pounced. They protested on the steps of city hall, singling out then-city councilman Torres for 'pink-washing' — that is, using Israel's openness towards LGBTQ citizens to obscure its occupation of Palestinian lands.Democratic Socialists of America Run 6 Candidates for NYC Council with BDS on their Agenda[10]First, the media are full of reports on the distress of many Democrats in purple states who say their party's failure with blue color and Latino voters has to do with its inability to push back the GOP's portrayal of democrats as Socialists, as did Representative Donna Shalala of Florida, who lost her seat in a Hispanic district, according to a NY Times report. As did Representative Vicente Gonzalez, a Democrat from South Texas, who said, 'Defund police, open borders, socialism — it's killing us.' Republicans made incremental gains with voters of color in a campaign in which Joe Biden's two main agenda items were: I am not Trump, and I am against systemic racial injustice. Now, on their path to self-destruction, national Democrats are looking on with horror as a group known as Democratic Socialists of America, led by renowned politicians such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Michigan), is launching attacks to establish a bridgehead in the NY State Assembly and the NY City Council. On Saturday, the Democratic Socialists of America endorsed six candidates for City Council, including Tiffany Caban, who in 2019 lost by a hair her primary bid for Queens County's District Attorney; as well as Adolfo Abreu from the Bronx; Jaslin Kaur from Queens, and Michael Hollingsworth, Alexa Aviles, and Brandon West from Brooklyn. There are 51 seats in the City Council (3 of them held by Republicans), so even if all six DSA candidates win, they won't be able to establish a Marxist government just yet. But Socialists are also converging on both NY Statehouses: on Nov. 3, five DSA candidates have won their races: Jabari Brisport in the Senate, and Phara Souffrant Forrest, Marcela Mitaynes, Zohran Mamdani, and Emily Gallagher in the Assembly.CAA reiterates call for intervention by Charity Commission after another senior figure at Islamic Relief Worldwide has resigned over alleged antisemitism[11]Yet another figure at Islamic Relief Worldwide has resigned over alleged antisemitism in the third such incident in just six months. It has now emerged that Tayeb Abdoun, a former interim-CEO at the charity who has worked there for 25 years, resigned on 14th October after being confronted over a picture he reportedly posted on Facebook of a knife with a thumbs up and wrote: 'Lay the bodies of the Jews on the top of the mountains, so that no dog in Palestine must suffer hunger.' Other controversial posts were also uncovered, and Mr Abdoun resigned after the Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger confronted him. In a statement, Islamic Relief Worldwide reportedly said: 'We continue to work as an organisation to root out anyone that does not meet our core values as a respectful, faith-sensitive, non-discriminatory and principled charity.' Back in August, the entire board of Islamic Relief Worldwide resigned after a new trustee-director was discovered to have a history of antisemitic posts on social media. He had been appointed to replace another trustee who had previously resigned after his history of antisemitic social media posts was uncovered. This is therefore the third such incident to rock Britain's largest Muslim charity in just six months, making our representations to the Charity Commission all the more urgent.Yisrael Medad: And Yet Another Non-Published Letter to the New York Times[12]Robert Malley and Phillip H. Gordon suggest that President Trump's ""proposed peace plan was...drafted without input from the Palestinians"" and so, it was ""dead on arrival"" (""Trump Still Has 70 Days to Wreak Havoc Around the World"", Nov. 11). Unfortunately, we are left to wonder why there was no input. Was it because Palestinian Authority communications systems failed? Perhaps the Trump Administration made demands they considered outrageous, such as to halt funding the acts of terrorists and stop anti-Israel incitement in the schools? Maybe President Mahmoud Abbas refused to make any compromises or even to return to the negotiating table? Could it be that the PA is fearful of Hamas? Does Malley and Gordon actually know why? Yisrael MedadShiloh, IsraelLA Times Fails To Correct After Reporting Saeb Erekat Was Treated 'Near Tel Aviv'[13]The Los Angeles Times has failed to correct a basic factual error, apparently originating from the Palestine Liberation Organization, that Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat was transferred from his home to Jericho to a hospital near Tel Aviv for treatment of COVID-19. In fact, Erekat was treated in a Jerusalem hospital, a politically inconvenient fact for the Palestinian leadership which does not recognize Israel's capital city. In their Nov. 10 article, 'Longtime chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat dies,' Tracy Wilkinson and Noga Tarnopolsky inaccurately reported near the bottom of the story that Erekat 'was transferred to the Sheba Medical Center, near Tel Aviv, by an ambulance heavily guarded by Israeli army vehicles.' As was correctly reported at the top of the article, Erekat died in Jerusalem's Hadassah Ein Kerem hospital, and that's where he was transferred when he left his home in Jericho. The misinformation about the Tel Aviv hospital apparently originated with Fatah, which initially tweeted that Erekat was receiving treatment in an Israeli hospital in Tel Aviv. While the PLO subsequently clarified that original, erroneous Tweet, The Los Angeles Times inexplicably has yet to amend its report. Reuters Errs on 'New Settlement' in Golan Heights[14]In a Nov. 8 article, 'Loved or Hated, Trump stamped his face on the Middle East conflict,' Reuters erroneously reported: 'Trump Heights' was the name given to a new settlement in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, after he recognised Israel's claim to sovereignty over the plateau that was captured from Syria in a 1967 war. (Emphasis added.)Though Prime Minister Netanyahu promised the establishment of a 'new community' on the Golan Heights in 2019, Trump Heights is not a newly established community, but the renaming of Kela-Beruchim, home to a tiny, neglected elderly population (14 retirees and five students). As Haaretz reported ('Netanyahu Promised to Name a 'New' Community After Trump. We Went There and Locals Are Not Pleased'): on May 12, Netanyahu announced thata site had been located for the new community named for Trump, and it would initially comprise 110 plots for religious and secular families But the location chosen by the government is anything but new. Indeed, 63-year-old Nina Missin has been calling it home for well over 20 years. Israel has not founded a community, or 'settlement,' in the Golan Heights in decades. Though CAMERA has notified Reuters of the error, editors have yet to correct.

Anti-Semitic incidents once again made up the majority of hate crimes based on religion. In addition, federal officials recorded the highest number of hate-motivated killings since the FBI began collecting that data in the early 1990s, with the number of murders nationwide more than doubling the previous year. The total number of hate crimes rose to the highest level in more than a decade. The Anti-Defamation (ADL) League cautioned that the FBI's numbers probably represent just a fraction of total hate crimes committed nationwide. The FBI recorded 953 hate crimes against Jews in 2019, a 14 percent increase from the 835 recorded in 2018, and similar to the 938 recorded in 2017. In 2019, hate crimes against Jews constituted 62% of all hate crimes based on religion, slightly up from 58% in 2018 and 2017. Last year saw a series of lethal anti-Semitic attacks that sparked fear and anxiety among American Jews. A synagogue shooting in Poway, California killed one person exactly six months after the 2018 synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh in which 11 Jews were murdered. In December, a shooting in Jersey City, New Jersey that ended at a kosher supermarket killed two Jews and two others. Later that month, a stabbing at a Hanukkah party in Monsey, New York killed one. The New York-area attacks came amid a spate of anti-Semitic harassment and assaults in Orthodox neighborhoods in Brooklyn. German sports body condemns vandalism of exhibition honoring Jewish athletes[20]The German Olympic Sports Confederation has condemned an act of vandalism against an outdoor exhibition highlighting Jewish sports stars in Bochum. 'This cowardly act is a blow for the whole of German sports,' confederation president Alfons Hörmann said in a statement Thursday. Plexiglas figurines of track and field athlete Lilli Henoch and gymnasts Alfred and Gustav Felix Flatow were destroyed on Monday night or the early hours of Tuesday morning. The figure of Walther Bensemann, one of the founders of the German soccer federation (DFB), was already damaged in the previous weeks, when the Flatow cousins' memorial had been targeted with anti-Semitic graffiti. 'We condemn the devious attacks on the important memorials to our sports comrades Lilli Henoch, Alfred and Gustav Felix Flatow, and Walther Bensemann. We also stand in solidarity with our member associations the DFB and Makkabi Germany, and all those who actively promote the values of sport,' Hörmann said. The traveling exhibition focused on Jewish stars in German sport until 1933 — when the Nazis began persecuting Jews — and beyond, as the Nazis also exploited some of the athletes to avoid a threatened boycott of the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin. 'The willful destruction of the figures in this important exhibition has stunned us,' said Bochum mayor Thomas Eiskirch, who had opened the exhibition on Oct. 7. 'It's the limit. Bochum was and remains a cosmopolitan and tolerant city in which the culture of remembrance will always have its place.' UAE's Etihad formally announces launch of daily direct flights to Israel in 2021[21]Etihad Airways, the United Arab Emirates' national carrier, announced Monday it will start direct flights to Israel in March 2021 after the countries' recent agreement to normalize ties. The Abu Dhabi-based airline 'will launch daily scheduled year-round flights to Tel Aviv,' it said in a statement. It added the service will begin on March 28 — approximately six months after the UAE signed a US-brokered deal to formalize relations with Israel, the first such accord between a Gulf nation and the Jewish state. 'The commencement of scheduled flights is a historic moment and as an airline, cements Etihad's commitment to growing opportunities for trade and tourism,' said Mohammad al-Bulooki, chief operating officer of Etihad Aviation Group, according to the statement. Last month an Etihad flight lauded as the first commercial shuttle between the two countries landed at Ben Gurion airport, before departing for Abu Dhabi later that day with an Israeli travel and tourism delegation on board. The crew of an Etihad Airlines flight wave Israeli flags after landing at Ben Gurion Airport, October 19, 2020 (Sivan Farag) Dubai's budget airline flydubai had already announced that it would start direct flights to Tel Aviv this month, operating 14 flights a week. Unlike Dubai and the other emirates that make up the UAE, Abu Dhabi has placed stringent coronavirus restrictions on entering the city. Israeli carrier Israir has announced that it will offer direct flights from Ben Gurion Airport to Abu Dhabi and Israeli national carrier El Al will also reportedly offer flights on the route.

We even managed to imagine the first time we would encounter the temple, while we still thought it was standing - until we arrived in Zion, and were greatly disappointed to discover that it had been destroyed. The Sigd holiday enables Ethiopian Jews to do communal introspection, become stronger, unite and dream of a better future: a mutual and spiritual future in Jerusalem. Despite the sadness over the destruction, and the amazement they felt, the Ethiopian immigrants to Israel were able to realize their long standing dream of seeing Jerusalem with their own eyes. And the dream, after a long, terrifying, painful and arduous journey, has become a reality that surpasses all imagination. A vaccine is needed for social correction to cure Israeli and world society. What is a person's value if we are socially injured? As it is said: ""if the mind is healthy, the body is healthy."" The values of Sigd can be a bridge and an opportunity for the Israeli society for social and personal correction while creating unity. As a young girl in Ethiopia, I remember the excitement I felt with every fiber of my being whenever we spoke about Jerusalem, the respect we felt for it and the strong spiritual feeling we had - especially on the Sigd holiday, the greatest traditional, social and communal event. Every year, about 50 days after Yom Kippur, just like at Mount Sinai and the covenant between the children of Israel and God, the whole family would ascend a mountain. United and together, we would pray, bow down and ask God to return us to the Land of Israel, with prayers like it's described in the Return to Zion section in the Book of Ezra and Nehemiah. The prayers and songs were led by the Keses, the high priests of Ethiopian Jews. I remember the beautiful white clothes and the two days of coming to the mountain by Ambuber, one of the important villages of Beta Israel in Ethiopia until their immigration to Israel.

In an unusually strongly worded speech, António Guterres urged major reform to the UN security council, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, to address systemic inequalities exposed by the coronavirus pandemic.
The health crisis had revealed the world's fragility and ""laid bare risks we have ignored for decades: inadequate health systems; gaps in social protection; structural inequalities; environmental degradation; the climate crisis"", he said.
He said the pandemic was exposing ""fallacies and falsehoods everywhere: the lie that free markets can deliver healthcare for all. The fiction that unpaid care work is not work, the delusion that we live in a post-racist world, the myth that we are all in the same boat.""
The anger of the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements were a measure of ""utter disillusionment with the status quo"", Guterres said, while colonialism and patriarchy were historical sources of inequality.
""Let's not fool ourselves. The legacy of colonialism still reverberates. We see this in economic and social injustice, the rise of hate crimes and xenophobia; the persistence of institutionalised racism and white supremacy.
""We see this in the global trade system. Economies that were colonised are at greater risk of getting locked into the production of raw materials and low-tech goods - a new form of colonialism. And we see this in global power relations.""
Speaking from the UN's New York headquarters, Guterres was delivering the annual Nelson Mandela lecture - on what would have been Mandela's 102nd birthday -, to an online audience for the first time in its 18-year history.
Africa, Guterres said, had been a ""double victim"", first because of colonialism and second, because African countries were underrepresented in the international institutions set up after the second world war.
""The nations that came out on top 70 years ago have refused to contemplate the reforms needed to change power relations in international institutions. The composition and voting rights in the UN security council and the boards of the Bretton Woods system are a case in point. Inequality starts at the top: in global institutions. Addressing inequality must start by reforming them.""
More advanced countries, he said, had failed to deliver the support needed for the developing world in these ""dangerous times"". He called for a new global deal, based on fairness and a revamped social contract, to deliver universal health cover and the possibility of a universal basic income.
His comments follow those of the UN's outgoing special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, who described the World Bank's $1.90 (£1.50) a day international poverty line as a "" scandalously unambitious benchmark "" that had painted a false picture of ""heroic gains"" against poverty.
Guterres said the world had been brought to its knees by a microscopic virus that had set back progress on eradicating poverty and narrowing inequality by years. He warned that it could bring famines of ""historic proportion"" and push 100 million people into extreme poverty.
""We face the deepest global recession since world war two, and the broadest collapse in incomes since 1870,"" he said. Workers in the informal economy, small and medium businesses, and people with caring responsibilities, mostly women, had been hit worst.
""Deep disparities begin before birth, and define lives - and early deaths,"" he said.
More than 70% of the world's people were living with rising income and wealth inequality, he said, while the 26 richest people held as much wealth as half the global population. In developed countries, more than 50% of 20-year olds were in higher education, a figure that dropped to 3% in less developed countries.
""Even more shocking: some 17% of the children born 20 years ago in countries with low human development have already died.""
Everyone suffered the consequences, he said, because inequality was linked to economic instability, corruption, financial crises, crime, and physical and mental health.
Guterres said the climate crisis and digital transformation were ""seismic shifts"" that would define the 21st century and heralded a new movement for racial equality, human rights and the rights of future generations. Young climate activists were on the frontline, he said.
""This movement rejects inequality and division, and unites young people, civil society, the private sector, cities, regions and others behind policies for peace, our planet, justice and human rights for all. It is already making a difference.
""Now is the time for global leaders to decide: will we succumb to chaos, division and inequality? Or will we right the wrongs of the past and move forward together, for the good of all?
""We are at breaking point. But we know which side of history we are on."""

While inside the Queens 7-Eleven Kwon told the man he 'should be ashamed'

A young South Korean man has captured the moment he was attacked by a racist thug at a 7-Eleven.
Shopper Sungmin Kwon, 23, was trying to buy a jug of juice and some popcorn from the store near his home in Queens, New York, when the man behind him in the queue launched into a foul-mouthed tirade. 
The man, who wore a blue polo shirt and had his black mask around his chin, blamed Asian and Chinese people for the coronavirus pandemic that has now killed more than 119,000 Americans, Kwon told the Daily News.
'I just felt like it was important to speak up and show people like him that his kind of behavior will not be tolerated,' he said.
In a video of the attack at the store on Northern Blvd in Bayside on Saturday night the man threw several punches before pushing Kwon to the ground.
He had taken out his phone to film after the man called him a 'g**k' and lifted a leg as if to kick him.
Kwon had approached the man after paying for his snacks. He said: 'Bro, you got a f***ing problem, you should really be ashamed of yourself.'
In a short video posted to Facebook, the man said: 'Get the f**k out of here, you g**k.'
In another slightly longer, 35-second clip, Kwon walked up to the man who lashed out and tried to grab Kwon's phone.
'This man has assaulted me,' Kwon said in the video, turning the camera around to show his own face.
'You f--king g--k, get the f--k away from me,' the man said. 
Kwon said: 'You just pushed me, bro.'
Then there's a second scuffle, Kwon is pushed to the ground again and the video stops. 
'He grabbed me, and he was trying to steal my phone,' Kwon told The News.
Two of Kwon's friends, who had been waiting in the car, came inside to see what was going on. Kwon decided to call the police and that's when his attacker 'made a run for it,' Kwon revealed. 
As the man drove off in a jeep Kwon photographed the number plate. Officers from the 111th Precinct showed up minutes later.
Authorities confirmed Kwon reported the incident, and said the NYPD's Hate Crimes Task Force is investigating.
Instances of racism against Asian Americans have also surged during the coronavirus pandemic with several examples recorded on a representative list by the Anti Defamation League. 
There are now more than 2.2million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the US, 211,000 of those in New York City. Some 17,389 people have died in NYC since the pandemic began in February. 
Last week an Asian woman exercising in a California park was the victim of racist abuse from a woman who threatened violence and yelled 'Go back to whatever f****** Asian country you came from.'
The disturbing incident, which was captured on cell phone footage, happened last Wednesday on a set of stairs at Charles H. Wilson Park in Torrance.
According to the Twitter account that shared the footage, the victim was working out on the staircase when a white woman bumped into her. 
The victim responds to the bump by saying 'Jesus' just seconds before the older woman launches into a racially charged tirade. 
'Hey, listen to me! We don't play games here anymore. Next time you ever talk to me like that you're going to get you a** kicked by my family. They're going to f*** you up!' the woman says. 
The victim questions what she did to cause the sudden outburst, but the unidentified woman continues to hurl insults and says 'because you're an a******.' 
'Why don't you go somewhere else?' the woman says. 'Get the f*** out of this world, get the f*** out of these stairs, go back to whatever f****** Asian country you belong in! 
'This is not your place; this is not your home. We do not want you here!' the woman adds.
She then added: 'You put that on Facebook, I hope you do because every f****** person will beat the crap out of you from here on out.
'Don't you ever say ""oh Jesus"" to me when I want to use the stairs you little b****.'
The victim points out that there are other stairs located throughout the park, but this does not quell the woman's verbal attack. 
'You are a sick, f****** ignorant teenager... Who wears black in California sun? Who the f*** wears black? Are you an idiot? You wear black in California sun? Seriously?'
The victim said the altercation was unnerving and she's not afraid to return to Charles H. Wilson Park. 
ABC 7 revealed that the incident was reported to Torrance city officials and Mayor Patrick J. Furey.
'The Torrance Police Department is investigating and will determine the appropriate course of action. And, all visitors to our open spaces should always feel safe and free to exercise while practicing social distancing without conflict.
'Conduct like that displayed on the video cannot be tolerated,' Furey said in a statement.
The victim's friend who tweeted the video wrote: 'My friend was threatened in Wilson Park in Torrance, California today while she was working out in a public park by a Karen. She now does not feel safe to exercise in the park because of this. This is infuriating.'
Another friend of the victim claimed 'there was no backstory' to the incident and that her friend was subjected to the racist rant without provocation.
A screenshot of a text reportedly between the victim and the friend shows her explaining the incident.
'But one person was like, ""Oh, what did she do to provoke Karen,""' the victim wrote. 'I jumped on the stairs and worked out. She walked into me.' 
The video was trending in the midst of protests for racial justice across the United States. 
The protests were sparked by the death of George Floyd, a 36-year-old African-American man who died after a white officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.
Black Lives Matter demonstrators have called for police forces across the US to be defunded and replaced by less aggressive systems. "

At the unfortunate news of Pride celebrations being cancelled across the world at the hands of COVID-19 (AKA Miss Rona), many have found themselves disheartened at the move to a virtual Pride. The Vancouver Pride Society itself announced back in April that Vancouver's Pride celebration, typically held in August, would also be put on hold. Yes, I know what you're all thinking and I fully agree: Miss Rona is definitely homophobic. 
SEE MORE: ""Pride events may be cancelled, but being proud is not.""
However, the move to a virtual Pride Month does not mean we cannot celebrate queerness in different, less physical ways. One way is to celebrate the trials and journeys of the queer community through appreciating art dedicated to telling their stories. So, here is a list of five queer-centric films you should check out to keep Pride Month alive and running.
The Queen

For fans of RuPaul's Drag Race, the documentary The Queen will contextualize the culture of pageant drag. Released in 1968, the film follows the Miss All-America Camp Beauty Contest, a pageant held in New York City. In between cuts of the contestants rehearsing choreography and trying on outfits and wigs, they discuss the struggles of a drag queen, such as being deemed too feminine to join the military and the discourse around gender reassignment surgery. 
The sisterhood shown in helping each other get into dresses and applying each other's makeup is juxtaposed with the competitive side of the drag pageant world - a side which reveals itself in overdramatic breakdowns, petty arguments, and incredibly loud egos. Avid Drag Race fans may recognize the legendary Crystal LaBeija, who Season 9/All-Stars 3 contestant Aja impersonated for her All-Stars Snatch Game. Even for viewers who may not be well versed in Drag Race, the film is charmingly entertaining and very approachable to delve into the drag scene - trust me, the drama is so theatrical you can't help but sit back and enjoy.

Boy Erased

Based off of Garrard Conley's memoir of the same name, Boy Erased follows Jared Eamons as he is sent to a gay conversion therapy facility. While there, Jared confronts the pressure that comes with having a pastor for a father and a complacent mother who only wants ""what's best for him."" As a film that mirrors Conley's life, Boy Erased provides a window into the broken homes that many LGBTQ2+ members are subjected to. It offers an accurate and heartwrenching display of the hardships some LGBTQ2+ youth face, without appropriating or romanticizing them. As someone whose parents were more accepting of my sexuality, this film gave me a clear sense of my own privilege and put into perspective just how abusive conversion therapy is. I will warn that as a realistic depiction of conversion therapy, this movie contains triggering conversations and themes.

The Normal Heart

Another film that was first literature, The Normal Heart follows writer Ned Weeks in New York City in the midst of the rising HIV-AIDS crisis from 1981 to 1984. The film shows Ned and his friends struggling with loss due to the crisis. Elucidated in the film is the reoccuring oppressive rejection by news outlets not wanting to cover a disease mostly impacting homosexual men. Being based on real-life events, the film shows viewers an accurate depiction of the anxiety, companionship, and heartbreak that befell many during such grave circumstances. While there is romance involved throughout various plots of the movie, it puts an appropriate amount of weight on how heartbreaking this pandemic truly was. One particularly moving scene shows the coming together of LGBTQ2+ members in the face of discrimination - a sentiment I think is extraordinarily significant at this time.

Portrait of a Lady on Fire (Portrait de la jeune fille en feu)
Image courtesy of Lilies Films.
Right off the bat, I will say this film is appropriately titled because it was literal fire. This French film sees a forbidden affair begin between two women in late 18th century France. Painter Marianne is commissioned to paint a portrait of aristocrat Héloïse who is being married off to a Milanese nobleman. Héloïse finds that her bond with Marianne grows stronger as the two spend more time together, complicating the fact that Héloïse is expected to be married. 
Captivating in both cinematography and character chemistry, Portrait of a Lady on Fire truly brings to life the simultaneous thrill and sorrow that come with having someone light your fire, only for the presence of a man to put that out. As a non-traditional rom-com, I think this film captures the poetic injustice that sometimes accompanies falling in love as someone who is LGBTQ2+ and will have you wishing you were caught up in a whirlwind affair in 18th century France. If the plot isn't enough, just look at the dresses in the film, they define elegance and I need one now.

Boys Don't Cry
Image courtesy of Fox Searchlight.
Despite this film being called Boys Don't Cry, I sure as hell did watching it. The film is based off the real life story of Brandon Teena, a trans man, and follows his journey to find both himself and love. As Brandon traverses several hardships as a trans man, the film represents the strength that comes with continually facing oppression on the journey toward honing one's identity. 
Ultimately, this film doesn't sugarcoat just how horrifically trans people are treated, and doesn't rely on comedy or romance to give the main character presence and agency. Although this film was released in 1999, Boys Don't Cry depicts several of the challenges the trans community continues to face today. Scenes in this movie display the disrespectful and immoral reality of blatant misgendering, hate crimes, and the lack of sympathy from people who do not wish to get involved in trans-related violence. While there are a few gruesome scenes, these offer a lens into the reality many trans people face on a day-to-day basis, and are truthfully significant to acknowledge and watch.

The celebrity chef, 47, shared a Facebook post on Wednesday stating that the riots across the U.S. in response to the death of George Floyd are part of a media conspiracy staged by 'the elite' to distract citizens from the coronavirus pandemic. 
'With the wave of a wand the media diverted your attention from a ""deadly"" pandemic to racial riots, and you didn't even stop to notice,' the post reads.
'Stop taking the bait and being spoon fed by the media. They are here to misinform you. Think critically and research for yourself,' it continues.
'Do not mistake rioters with protesters. There is plenty of evidence showing you that the riots were instigated by organisations affiliated with the elite.
'It is no accident that videos of police brutality have suddenly gone viral. I hope you see the pattern. Stay vigilant, be prepared, don't fall for the new world agenda. And once again think, it's not illegal yet.
'We are waking up, and the elite are afraid.'
Evans captioned the post: 'I invite you to read and feel into these words that someone sent me. Or simply scroll on.'
The origins of the meme are unclear, but Evans probably sourced it from a Facebook page dedicated to conspiracy theories - which he has done before.
The post sparked backlash from Evans' once-loyal fans, several of whom were appalled by how he was portraying the anti-racism protests.
'Jesus dude, do you mind? People are facing physical violence from the people who are supposed to be protecting them, and you're too busy rEaLIsinG tHe tRUtH that you suddenly think hate crimes shared via organic reach are just the ""lamestream"" media,' one person commented.
'Just because you can suddenly share your thoughts without breaking a contract, doesn't make them any less cracked.'
Another wrote: 'I really liked you Pete until this post. This movement has the ability to bring never seen before change for black people in many countries, especially ours.
'And you, a person who has the power to influence others, is choosing instead not to see the possibilities for miraculous positive change and instead vilify it.'
Others pointed out there was no conspiracy behind the recent wave of police brutality, saying that such behaviour was just being caught on camera more regularly.
One Facebook wrote: 'I'm sorry, but unless you've lived it, you will never understand and it's no new world, it's an old world for many that's finally being exposed.'
Several conspiracy theories about the George Floyd protests have surfaced on social media since his death in custody last Monday.
One example of the misinformation is the baseless rumour that Floyd is alive and that his death was a hoax designed to cause social division.
Another false claim is that George Soros - the Hungarian-born billionaire investor, philanthropist and Holocaust survivor - is secretly funding the protests. 
A spokeswoman for Mr. Soros told the New York Times: 'We deplore the false notion that the people taking to the streets to express their anguish are paid, by George Soros or anyone else.'
Aryeh Tuchman of the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish organisation that opposes antisemitism, also told the Times of Israel: 'It has been very common among right-wing pundits and leaders in the media to ascribe the activity on the ground to Soros, who they claim is paying protesters to show up and advance his alleged anti-American agenda.'
Daily Mail Australia has contacted Pete Evans for comment. 
Anti-police brutality demonstrations have erupted in more than 400 cities in all 50 states in the 10 days since Floyd, a 46-year-old unarmed black man, died in custody in Minneapolis after being forcefully restrained by a white officer for eight minutes.
The riots have so far resulted in more than 9,000 arrests and major cities, including New York, Atlanta, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., have enforced curfews.
Derek Chauvin, the officer who restrained Floyd, has been charged with second-degree murder, and the three other officers on the the scene have been charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder.
In recent weeks, Evans has shared dozens of social media posts vaguely hinting at a global conspiracy, encouraging his followers to 'join the dots'. 
Meanwhile, he has faced backlash for spreading false information about 5G technology and the non-existent link between vaccines and autism, not to mention his wildly off-brand pro-Trump rhetoric.
His views have become so bizarre since quitting Channel Seven earlier this year, that a leading doctor has expressed concerns for his mental health. 
Dr Harry Nespolon, the president of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, said last month he feared Evans was 'in trouble' and advised him to book an appointment with his GP.
The chef insisted he was perfectly fine, physically and mentally.
Evans drew criticism earlier this week when he shared a video of U.S. President Donald Trump saying he would use force to 'take back the streets' in the wake of America's race riots.
He captioned a video of Trump announcing new measures to stop violent protesters with a red love heart emoji, despite the president facing widespread condemnation for his handling of the demonstrations.
'I have no respect left for you Pete! How can you agree with him when black people don't have the same rights?' one person commented. 
'How can anyone support Trump! He's clearly incompetent in COVID-19, contributed to such division in the States and gives tax breaks to the very rich while the poor get poorer,' another wrote. 
Similar comments included, 'I'm so confused, what is to love about this?' and, 'A Trump supporter? Yuck.'
One disappointed fan added: 'You have always been someone I've looked up to with your consistent messages of peace and love. So the fact that you're endorsing this man and his fight fire with fire proposal is truly appalling.'
Evans has used his page to share posts in support of Trump in the past.
This comes after broadcaster Ben Fordham revealed that the celebrity chef may be considering a career in politics.
Speaking on his 2GB radio show on Monday, Ben explained that a fan had suggested the idea to Evans on social media and he responded with: 'Stay tuned'."
68,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1251/Files (250).DOCX","Newstex Blogs",2020-06-24,"923 words",NA,"Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough LLP",NA,"Supreme Court's Pro-LGBTQ Ruling: What It Means and Related Legislative Solutions",FALSE,"Jun 23, 2020( JD Supra: http://www.jdsupra.com Delivered by Newstex) In Bostock v. Clayton County, Ga., the U.S. Supreme Court (SCOTUS) changed the face of LGBTQ civil rights across the country. The landmark 6-3 decision confirms that Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits employment decisions based on a person's gender identity or sexual orientation.Writing for the majority, Justice Neil Gorsuch stated, 'An employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex. Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids. 
An employer who fires an individual merely for being gay or transgender defies the law.' The Cases The decision combined three lower-level court cases. In the first pair of cases (Bostock v. Clayton County, Ga; Altitude Express Inc. v. Zarda), each of two gay men alleged he was fired from his job (as a Georgia county government employee and a New York skydiving instructor, respectively) because of his sexual orientation. Each argued that the discrimination fell within Title VII's protections. One advocate paraphrased the argument, saying, 'If Don and Donna date men and you fire only Don, what else is that [other than sex discrimination]?' The lawyer for Bostock went further: 'If it's sex discrimination to say, 'You can't work for us if you are a woman and you have children at home,' it's also sex discrimination to say 'You can't work for us because you're a woman and you have a wife at home.'' In Bostock and Zarda, the employer defendants (and the DOJ) argued that sex discrimination does not include sexual orientation, that the definition of 'sex' refers to biological sex, and that any question under Title VII should be resolved by Congress in new legislation.The third suit (R.G. &#38; G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) involved a Michigan transgender woman (a funeral home director) who alleged discriminatory firing based on gender identity. The employee said she was fired after she indicated she would embrace her gender identity (transitioning from man to woman in identity) in the workplace. The EEOC's argument centered on whether someone could be fired for being insufficiently masculine or feminine and whether that, thus, involves 'sex' as used in Title VII. In other words, if the transgender woman had been assigned the female sex at birth and dressed as a woman, the firing would not have occurred; but, here, she was assigned the male sex at birth and dressed as a woman and was fired. Thus, she was fired for not meeting the employer's gender norms. The funeral home argued that sex discrimination is not tripped if the same gender role standard is applied to all persons based on sex. Noting that the employee's dressing habits would disobey 'God's commands,' the employer argued that it 'would have responded to a female employee who insisted on dressing as a manthe same way it responded to [the transgender woman].' The Impact The SCOTUS decision this week prevents discrimination in employment, giving employers across the country a uniform standard. It also repairs the patchwork of inconsistent and discriminatory state laws on the books.Over 25% of LGBTQ Americans report discrimination based on their LGBTQ status. And recent nationwide polls found that a majority of Americans incorrectly believed that LGBTQ persons already had federal civil rights protections. While gay marriage became the law in 2015, no federal civil rights safeguard existed prior to this week's decision: an LGBTQ person could get married and be fired on same day.The Bostock decision is a step toward correcting the disparate treatment across states. Three states (including Georgia) lack hate crime legislation, and 24 states (including Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina) permit employment discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Consequently, any gap in federal protections leaves LGBTQ persons in these states vulnerable. A Legislative Solution: Congress Considers The Equality Act Despite the Bostock ruling, the fight for LGBTQ civil rights is far from over. Comprehensive federal legislation is still needed to provide broader and clearer protections in all areas of civil rights. There are hundreds of similarly worded federal statutes that remain unclear. Potential areas for challenge include Title IX (federally funded educational programs), the Fair Housing Act, the Equal Pay Act, and the Affordable Care Act.To that end, progressives in Congress have attempted for decades to pass The Equality Act, which would amend civil rights laws (including those affecting public accommodation, housing, health, and education) to uniformly prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Importantly, The Equality Act would replace the word 'sex' in various statutes with 'sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity).' In May 2019, the House passed the bill, but it stalled in the Senate.The conservative alternative to the Equality Act — The Fairness for All Act — would make LGBTQ status a protected class separate from 'sex' and include exceptions under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act for discrimination by people or groups with anti-LGBTQ religious beliefs (e.g., religious organizations and small businesses such as wedding vendors). The Fairness for All Act has been introduced in the House but has not passed. "

During a four-hour service broadcast live on every major US television network from a church in Floyd's boyhood home of Houston, family members, clergy and politicians exhorted Americans to turn grief and outrage at his death into a moment of reckoning for the nation.
The funeral followed two weeks of protests ignited by graphic video footage of Floyd, 46, handcuffed and lying face down on a Minneapolis street while an officer kneels into the back of his neck for nearly nine minutes. The video shows Floyd gasping for air as he cries out, ""Mama,"" and groans, ""Please, I can't breathe,"" before falling silent and still.
The officer, Derek Chauvin, 44, has since been charged with second-degree murder and three other officers with aiding and abetting Floyd's May 25 death. All were dismissed from the department a day after the incident.
Floyd's dying words have become a rallying cry for hundreds of thousands of protesters around the globe who have since taken to the streets, undaunted by the coronavirus pandemic, demanding justice for Floyd and an end to mistreatment of minorities by U.S. law enforcement.
""I can breathe. And as long as I'm breathing, justice will be served,"" Floyd's niece Brooklyn Williams declared in a eulogy that drew applause from mourners inside the Fountain of Praise Church. ""This is not just a murder but a hate crime.""
'BIG FLOYD' Williams was one of several relatives and friends who addressed the service, remembering Floyd as a loving, larger-than-life personality. The memorial was punctuated by gospel music and a video montage of shared memories of the man affectionately known as ""Big Floyd.""
His younger brother, Terrence Floyd, spoke about awakening in the middle of the night in recent days traumatized by the memory of seeing his older sibling calling out for their mother as he lay dying.
His older brother, Philonise, sobbing in grief, told mourners, ""George was my personal superman.""
Civil rights activist the Rev. Al Sharpton called Floyd ""an ordinary brother"" who grew up in a housing project but left behind a legacy of greatness despite rejections in jobs and sports that prevented him from achieving all that he once aspired to become.
""God took the rejected stone and made him the cornerstone of a movement that is going to change the whole wide world,"" Sharpton said, invoking a biblical parable from the New Testament.
Sharpton said the Floyd family would lead a march on Washington being organized for Aug. 28 to mark the 57th anniversary of the 1963 ""I Have a Dream"" speech given from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial by civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., who was assassinated in 1968.
'HOME-GOING CELEBRATION'
Some 2,500 people attended the funeral, after more than 6,000 people filed past Floyd's open casket on Monday.
Two columns of uniformed Houston police officers saluted the golden casket as it was wheeled from the hearse into the church before the service. A horse-drawn carriage later bore the coffin on its last mile to the cemetery in Pearland, Texas, where Floyd was buried in a private ceremony.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate in the Nov. 3 election, addressed the funeral service via a video recording, lamenting that ""too many black Americans wake up knowing that they could lose their life in the course of just living their life.""
""We must not turn away. We cannot leave this moment thinking we can once again turn away from racism,"" he said.
Two voter registration tables were set up outside the church.
MOURNING FAMILIES Among those in attendance were loved ones of several other black men killed by white police or white civilians.
The mother of Eric Garner, the New York man who died in a police chokehold in 2014, was present, as was the family of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Georgia man who was shot and killed in February while jogging. Three white men were charged in his death.
Fallout from Floyd's death, and reaction to a spate of arson and looting that accompanied some of the otherwise mostly peaceful protests, also plunged President Donald Trump into one of the biggest crises of his tenure.
Hundreds of protesters packed Seattle's city hall late Tuesday night, chanting demands for the resignation of the mayor and the defunding the police force.
Days after Seattle's mayor and police chief promised a month-long moratorium on tear gas, the department used it again on protesters overnight Sunday, bringing severe criticism.
A Republican, Trump repeatedly threatened to order the military onto the streets to quell protests, focusing on restoring order while saying little about the U.S. racial wounds at the root of the upheavals.

71,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1251/Files (250).DOCX","Thai News Service",2020-06-25,"974 words","GENERAL NEWS",NA,NA,"United States: Experts Say Trump Can't Claim 'Kung Flu' Doesn't Affect Asian Americans in This Climate",FALSE,"White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Monday defended President Donald Trump's use of the term ""Kung Flu"" in referring to COVID-19 at a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
McEnany said Trump's rhetoric Saturday was an indictment of China rather than Asian Americans, NBC News reported.
Experts, however, stated that besides being offensive to both groups, the excuse doesn't hold up because Asians and Asian Americans are often viewed as a monolith because of implicit bias, the history of the racial group in the US and the current political climate.
Asian American advocacy groups responded to Trump's use of the racist phrase, which he used after joking that the coronavirus ""has more names than any disease in history"".
""I can name 'kung flu',"" Trump told the crowd, adding, ""I can name 19 different versions of names.""
CBS News White House correspondent Weijia Jiang, who said the term was previously used against her by an unnamed White House official, brought up the language at McEnany's news briefing Monday.
Jiang had asked about the language's impact on Asian Americans who are worried that the rhetoric could exacerbate hate attacks that have targeted the community since the pandemic started. McEnany claimed that Trump encouraged Americans to ""totally protect our Asian community"" before defending his use of the racist phrase.
""It's not a discussion about Asian Americans, who the president values and prizes as citizens of this great country,"" McEnany stated, adding, ""It is an indictment of China for letting the virus get here.""
But Andy Kang, executive director of the civil rights nonprofit Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Chicago, told NBC News that given the political and racial environment of the US, Trump's words could have harmful consequences.
""We're currently in the middle of a global pandemic that has caused a tremendous amount of suffering, both in economic terms and, more importantly, lives lost. On top of that, it's a presidential election year,"" he said, adding, ""With such an emotionally charged political atmosphere, it's irresponsible and reckless for our political leaders and candidates for our nation's highest office to engage in rhetoric that incites xenophobic scapegoating and violence.""
Kang noted that the history of Asian Americans in the US is dotted with evidence showing that such rhetoric has laid the groundwork for violence and shameful policies.
More than three decades ago, Vincent Chin, who was Chinese American, was fatally beat in Detroit by two white autoworkers, who mistook him for a Japanese man and blamed him for the loss of jobs in the US during the Japanese auto boom of the 1980s. Chin died just days before what was supposed to have been his wedding date.
In recent years, several Chinese American scholars and academics, including professor Xiaoxing Xi and scientist Sherry Chen, have been wrongfully accused of espionage by the US government. Both were the subjects of alarming accusations before their cases were abruptly dropped. Moreover, an NPR report revealed that the FBI has visited at least 10 universities since 2018 to urge them to develop protocols for monitoring students and visiting scholars from Chinese state-affiliated research institutions.
Public health authorities, including the World Health Organization (WHO), have warned that using terms that tie certain groups or industries to diseases are inaccurate and could be incendiary. In 2015, the WHO revised its naming guidelines to avoid stigmatizing communities or industries.
But Russell Jeung, chair and professor of Asian American Studies at San Francisco State University, stressed we need not look to history to find evidence of such misdirected anger.
The online hate crime reporting forum Stop AAPI Hate announced it had received 1,843 incident reports from March 19 to May 13. In more than a quarter of incidents, perpetrators invoked the words ""China"" or ""Chinese"" in their acts of discrimination. In 17.5 percent of cases, the assailants parroted the term ""Chinese virus"", the group added.
Jeung, who was involved in analyzing the cases, said half of the incidents of racist abuse were directed at people who weren't even ethnically Chinese.
Research shows that Trump's harmful rhetoric toward other groups has led to negative consequences. A study published in February showed that his inflammatory remarks toward the Latinx community had led to what researchers dubbed the ""emboldening effect"" - people are more likely to express their prejudices and to act on them after hearing his remarks. While statements condemning such rhetoric didn't completely negate the emboldening effect, they did soften it, according to the research.
McEnany not only claimed that Trump's remark was an indictment of China, but she also shifted blame to media outlets, including CNN and The Washington Post, that she said had used language identifying the illness by origin or location, like ""China virus"", in January. That was before the Asian American Journalists Association released guidelines in February to urge news outlets to use more responsible reporting practices.
Manjusha Kulkarni, executive director of Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, the group behind the reporting tool, stated that the rhetoric is an example of the president's pinning blame elsewhere, rather than taking responsibility for his handling of the virus.
The New York Times reported in April that Trump had gotten warnings from advisers, experts and intelligence agencies as early as January calling for aggressive action to deal with the virus. However, Trump continued to downplay the virus, and in February he had accused Democrats of ""politicizing"" it. It wasn't until March that he took actions like recommending shutting down certain cities.
""This is a danger not only for Asian Americans, but all Americans,"" Kulkarni added. - FNA"
72,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1251/Files (250).DOCX","Indian Media news",2020-06-18,"832 words",NA,NA,NA,"Anmol Narang becomes first observant Sikh to graduate from US Military Academy at West Point",FALSE," June 18 -- Anmol Narang has made history by becoming the first observant Sikh to graduate from the prestigious United States Military Academy at West Point, and the Second Lieutenant is hopeful that her efforts to represent her religion and community will encourage Americans to learn more about Sikhism.
 
US President Donald Trump on Saturday addressed the 1,107 graduates, including 23-year-old Narang, who gathered for the academy's annual commencement.
""It's an incredible feeling. It's a humbling experience, I have never worked harder for anything in my life. Being a Sikh woman is a very important part of my identity and if my experience can play a small role in being an inspiration for others, regardless of career field, that will be wonderful,"" Narang told CNN.
A second-generation immigrant born and raised in Roswell, Georgia, Narang had an early appreciation for military service due to her maternal grandfather's career in the Indian Army.
After she developed an interest in military service during high school, she began the process to apply for the West Point after her family visited Pearl Harbor National Memorial in Honolulu, Hawaii.
 
At the Saturday's ceremony, the graduates socially distanced 6 feet from one another across the Plain Parade Field to accommodate COVID-19 public health requirements instead of congregating at Michie Stadium, the ceremony's traditional location. Family and friends were not allowed to attend the ceremony but could watch it online, the report said.
""This premier military academy produces only the best of the best-the strongest of the strong-and the bravest of the brave. West Point is a universal symbol of American gallantry, loyalty, devotion, discipline, and skill,"" Trump said in his address.
""To the 1,107 who today become the newest officers in the most exceptional Army ever to take the field of battle, I am here to offer America's salute. Thank you for answering your nation's call,"" he said.
While other Sikhs have graduated from the academy, that Narang is the first observant Sikh to have graduated from West Point.
She hopes that her efforts to represent her religion and community will encourage Americans to learn more about the Sikh faith, the fifth largest religion in the world, the report said.
 
In 1987, the US Congress passed a law that prohibited Sikhs and several other religious communities from maintaining their articles of faith while in the military, despite a history of diverse service and simple accommodations.
The Sikh Coalition said that for 30 years, the visible Sikh articles of faith-including unshorn facial hair and turbans-were banned, despite being core tenets of the faith.
In response, for more than 10 years, the Sikh Coalition has led a campaign, in partnership with other Sikh and civil rights organisations, litigation partners, and like-minded advocates, to ensure equality of opportunity for Sikhs Americans in the US Armed Forces.
""I am immensely proud of (Second Lieutenant) Narang for seeing her goal through and, in doing so, breaking a barrier for any Sikh American who wishes to serve,"" said Simratpal Singh, US Army Captain and a family friend of Narang.
""The broader acceptance of Sikh service members among all of the service branches, as well as in top tier leadership spaces like West Point, will continue to benefit not just the rights of religious minority individuals, but the strength and diversity of the US military,"" Singh said in a statement.
 
Singh's 2016 suit over his own right to maintain his articles of faith in uniform spurred a critical change in the Army's accommodations policy in 2017, which streamlined the accommodations process for Sikh soldiers and ensured that accommodations would stay with them throughout their career.
In 2020, after granting a series of individual accommodations to Sikh airmen throughout the year prior, the US Air Force implemented a similarly updated policy.
 Since the Army and the Air Force changed their policies, at least 60 observant Sikhs are serving in those two branches of the military. The work continues to ensure equality of opportunity for Sikhs in the US Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, a media release said on Saturday.
There are an estimated 500,000 Sikh-Americans in the US.
There have been several attacks on Sikhs in America. Two Sikh Americans were killed in two separate incidents in one week in California in July 2017.
 
In March 2017, a 39-year-old Sikh man was shot in the arm outside his home in Kent, Washington, by a partially-masked gunman who shouted ""go back to your own country"".
In 2015, an elderly Sikh-American man was brutally assaulted and left with severe facial injuries by an assailant who yelled racial slurs like ""terrorist"" and ""Bin Laden"", in an apparent hate crime just before the US commemorated the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.
According to a 2009 Sikh Coalition report, 41 per cent of Sikhs surveyed in New York City had been called derogatory names, such as ""Osama bin Laden"" or ""terrorist""."

Experts, however, stated that besides being offensive to both groups, the excuse doesn't hold up because Asians and Asian Americans are often viewed as a monolith because of implicit bias, the history of the racial group in the US and the current political climate.
Asian American advocacy groups responded to Trump's use of the racist phrase, which he used after joking that the coronavirus ""has more names than any disease in history"".
""I can name 'kung flu',"" Trump told the crowd, adding, ""I can name 19 different versions of names.""
CBS News White House correspondent Weijia Jiang, who said the term was previously used against her by an unnamed White House official, brought up the language at McEnany's news briefing Monday.
Jiang had asked about the language's impact on Asian Americans who are worried that the rhetoric could exacerbate hate attacks that have targeted the community since the pandemic started. McEnany claimed that Trump encouraged Americans to ""totally protect our Asian community"" before defending his use of the racist phrase.
""It's not a discussion about Asian Americans, who the president values and prizes as citizens of this great country,"" McEnany stated, adding, ""It is an indictment of China for letting the virus get here.""
But Andy Kang, executive director of the civil rights nonprofit Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Chicago, told NBC News that given the political and racial environment of the US, Trump's words could have harmful consequences.
""We're currently in the middle of a global pandemic that has caused a tremendous amount of suffering, both in economic terms and, more importantly, lives lost. On top of that, it's a presidential election year,"" he said, adding, ""With such an emotionally charged political atmosphere, it's irresponsible and reckless for our political leaders and candidates for our nation's highest office to engage in rhetoric that incites xenophobic scapegoating and violence.""
Kang noted that the history of Asian Americans in the US is dotted with evidence showing that such rhetoric has laid the groundwork for violence and shameful policies.
More than three decades ago, Vincent Chin, who was Chinese American, was fatally beat in Detroit by two white autoworkers, who mistook him for a Japanese man and blamed him for the loss of jobs in the US during the Japanese auto boom of the 1980s. Chin died just days before what was supposed to have been his wedding date.
In recent years, several Chinese American scholars and academics, including professor Xiaoxing Xi and scientist Sherry Chen, have been wrongfully accused of espionage by the US government. Both were the subjects of alarming accusations before their cases were abruptly dropped. Moreover, an NPR report revealed that the FBI has visited at least 10 universities since 2018 to urge them to develop protocols for monitoring students and visiting scholars from Chinese state-affiliated research institutions.
Public health authorities, including the World Health Organization (WHO), have warned that using terms that tie certain groups or industries to diseases are inaccurate and could be incendiary. In 2015, the WHO revised its naming guidelines to avoid stigmatizing communities or industries.
But Russell Jeung, chair and professor of Asian American Studies at San Francisco State University, stressed we need not look to history to find evidence of such misdirected anger.
The online hate crime reporting forum Stop AAPI Hate announced it had received 1,843 incident reports from March 19 to May 13. In more than a quarter of incidents, perpetrators invoked the words ""China"" or ""Chinese"" in their acts of discrimination. In 17.5 percent of cases, the assailants parroted the term ""Chinese virus"", the group added.
Jeung, who was involved in analyzing the cases, said half of the incidents of racist abuse were directed at people who weren't even ethnically Chinese.
Research shows that Trump's harmful rhetoric toward other groups has led to negative consequences. A study published in February showed that his inflammatory remarks toward the Latinx community had led to what researchers dubbed the ""emboldening effect"" — people are more likely to express their prejudices and to act on them after hearing his remarks. While statements condemning such rhetoric didn't completely negate the emboldening effect, they did soften it, according to the research.
McEnany not only claimed that Trump's remark was an indictment of China, but she also shifted blame to media outlets, including CNN and The Washington Post, that she said had used language identifying the illness by origin or location, like ""China virus"", in January. That was before the Asian American Journalists Association released guidelines in February to urge news outlets to use more responsible reporting practices.
Manjusha Kulkarni, executive director of Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, the group behind the reporting tool, stated that the rhetoric is an example of the president's pinning blame elsewhere, rather than taking responsibility for his handling of the virus.
The New York Times reported in April that Trump had gotten warnings from advisers, experts and intelligence agencies as early as January calling for aggressive action to deal with the virus. However, Trump continued to downplay the virus, and in February he had accused Democrats of ""politicizing"" it. It wasn't until March that he took actions like recommending shutting down certain cities.
""This is a danger not only for Asian Americans, but all Americans,"" Kulkarni added."

[READ:Weekend Protests Call for Defunding Police]
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Congressional Black Caucus Chairwoman Karen Bass and nearly two dozen Democrats, who all wore Kente cloth stoles, introduced ""The Justice and Policing Act of 2020"" to strengthen police accountability by creating a federal registry to catalog police misconduct, require police to have body and dashboard cameras and limit the transfer of military weapons to civilian police departments. Democrats are also pushing to limit ""qualified immunity,"" a legal doctrine that shields police officers from being sued for actions that don't clearly violate a person's constitutional rights. 
The bill also addresses the way black Americans have died in recent deadly police incidents. The legislation seeks to ban police officers from using chokeholds and outlaws an officer kneeling on a person's neck, which is how Floyd died two weeks ago. It would also stop ""no-knock"" warrants in drug cases, which permit police officers to enter and search homes without identifying themselves. In March, Breonna Taylor died during a police raid in her home. 
The bill would also make lynching a federal hate crime, a provision that has passed the House but which Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, the lone holdout, was able to stall last week in the Senate. He said that the legislation was too broad and is offering an amendment that would change the threshold of what should be considered lynching and adds ""a serious bodily injury standard."" 
""This is a first step, there is more to come. We cannot accept anything less than fundamental, structural change,"" Pelosi said at a Monday press conference. 
Bass said that the legislation has so far garnered 200 co-sponsors in the House and Senate, adding that ""the world is witnessing the birth of a new movement in our country."" 
[READ:Protests Raise Policing Dispute in D.C.]
Democrats proposed legislation two weeks after Floyd, an unarmed black man, died when a white police officer kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Democrats rushed to piece together a reform bill, though it's expected to hit some hurdles among Republicans. As momentum grows among activists and protesters, the bill doesn't address ""defunding"" the police, though most of the funding for departments come from states and localities. 
When asked by reporters about the movement for ""defunding"" the police, Democrats noted that there will be no new funding allocated to police departments, with Bass adding that ""part of that cry [for defunding] is a desire for there to be significant higher investment in communities."" 
""There are many things we call upon our police departments to deal with -- mental health issues, policing in schools and the rest -- that we could rebalance some of our funding to address some of those issues more directly,"" Pelosi said, referring to calls to move some money in police budgets to social programs. 
Prior to the announcement, Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York held a moment of silence with a group of Democrats in Emancipation Hall of the U.S. Capitol for Floyd and other black Americans who have died due to police brutality. 
[MORE:Protests Filled With Anguish]
Republicans are unlikely to back the measure in full, but some have signaled a willingness to work with Democrats on some provisions. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California said last week he believed both parties could ""easily find common ground,"" though it's not immediately clear what reforms his conference would support. 
""I believe this is a moment for us. I hope that, in this moment in time, Congress rises to the occasion,"" McCarthy told reporters on a call last week. ""Because I will tell you, from the [lawmakers] that I have talked to on both sides of the aisle, there's a great desire to do that."" 
But as Democrats introduced their legislation, McCarthy reaffirmed GOP support for the police and attacked Democrats for wanting to defund police departments, though the particular bill doesn't address it. 
""To the police officers across the country who put on the uniform every day and uphold their oath -- THANK YOU,"" McCarthy tweeted Monday morning. ""Democrats want to defund you, but Republicans will never turn our backs on you.""

It is an assault on our humanity (op ed by Ambassador Gingrich published by Fox News[1] on November 19, 2020) Seventy-five years after the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp and the defeat of Nazism, anti-Semitism is on the rise. In many places around the world, Jews are vilified, demonized, and physically attacked. This increase in incidents is being reported across the globe. 
In the United States, the rate of anti-Semitic incidents has risen to near-historic levels, punctuated by a deadly massacre in Pittsburgh, a horrific attack in Jersey City, and ongoing attacks in New York City, where more than half of the hate crimes in 2019 targeted Jewish people. In Europe, according to a 2018 survey by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, nearly 80 percent of European Jews believe anti-Semitism is a growing problem, and 40 percent live in daily fear of being attacked. The United Nations released an unprecedented report in 2019 identifying anti-Semitism as a serious human rights issue, which is 'toxic to democracy and mutual respect of citizens and threatens all societies in which it goes unchallenged.' Knowledge about the Holocaust is woefully inadequate. A September 2020 survey among young Americans revealed a clear lack of awareness of key historical facts: 31 percent of those surveyed did not know when the Holocaust happened; 63 percent did not know that 6 million Jews were killed; and 48 percent could not name a single concentration camp. This is unconscionable, and every free society has a stake in reversing this trend. As President Trump has made clear, anti-Semitism is not only a Jewish problem. It is an assault on our humanity and demands resolute action. Under President Trump's leadership, the United States has taken bold action to raise awareness of the Holocaust and confront the rise of anti-Semitism at home and abroad. As the president said earlier this year in marking the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, '[We] recommit ourselves to the fight against anti-Semitism and to the two words that cannot be repeated often enough: Never Again.' Assuring such atrocities will never again occur requires action. In 2018, President Trump signed the Justice for Uncompensated Survivors Today Act, which requires the U.S. Department of State to report to Congress on steps taken by 47 countries to compensate Holocaust survivors and their heirs for assets seized by Nazi Germany and postwar communist governments. The president also issued an Executive Order in 2019 ensuring that enforcement of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 extends to anti-Semitic discrimination. And last month the U.S. Department of State aired it's first-ever conference on combatting anti-Semitism online. The United States government is pressing other governments to provide adequate security for their Jewish populations and is advocating for the investigation, prosecution, and punishment of hate crimes. It is calling on countries to remove anti-Semitic content from textbooks in publicly funded schools, to promote Holocaust education, and to condemn hate speech wherever it occurs. International cooperation is critical to these efforts. The United States currently works with the European Union, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA), and other international organizations to confront and combat anti-Semitism. Faith communities, through partnerships, coalitions, dialogue, and mutual respect, also have an incredibly important role to play. The Muslim-Jewish Advisory Council in the United States is one example of successful interfaith cooperation, bringing together leaders in the American Jewish and Muslim communities to advocate for issues of common concern. Similarly, the Muslim-Jewish Leadership Council in Europe unites prominent figures from both communities to 'free religious people and religions from prejudice, false claims, attacks, and violence.' At the Vatican, Pope Francis is a significant ally in the fight against anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial. In his message to the Simon Wiesenthal Center in January, Pope Francis called upon all of us to keep the memory of the Holocaust alive. 'If we lose our memory, we destroy our future,' he warned. In March, Pope Francis opened the Apostolic Archives of Pope Pius XII. Many Jewish organizations have expressed support for this decision and the availability of the records is 'enormously important to Catholic-Jewish relations,' according to Rabbi David Rosen, the Director of Interreligious Affairs for the American Jewish Committee (AJC). In response to the great challenge of anti-Semitism and reaffirming our steadfast support for the Jewish community, the U.S. Embassy to the Holy See is hosting a virtual symposium Thursday titled 'Never Again: Confronting the Global Rise of Anti-Semitism.' Leading experts are discussing the importance of Holocaust remembrance and education and sharing best practices for confronting the disturbing rise of anti-Semitism around the world. I am pleased that U.S. Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism Elan Carr and Holy See Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin are participating in this important symposium. With dialogue and cooperation across governments, faith communities and civil society we can confront anti-Semitism, sow the seeds of peace, and reaffirm our commitment to the eternal promise: Never again.

Mindich",NA,"Carry Yom Kippur message to the booth: A more perfect union of empathy",FALSE,"""We have trespassed,"" begins the Viddui, the sacred prayer of repentance that will be repeated on Yom Kippur, which began Sunday at dusk.
When I was a child, I silently replied that I had not trespassed.
""We have betrayed. We have stolen. We have slandered.""
I have not, I used to think. As I matured, I began to see in myself literal and metaphorical trespasses, betrayals, and other sins.
But it was only recently as a middle-aged adult that I had an epiphany: The prayer is speaking in the first-person plural. When taken to its logical conclusion, it offers a radical thought: We all need to atone for the sins of us all. Imagine a world in which rather than call out folks on social media, pointing blame at the Other, we take ownership of all of our collective sins. With this collective guilt comes an awesome burden that is easily translatable to our times.
We have put children in cages.
We have permitted sexual violence.
We have polluted our waters.
We have placed migrants and asylum-seekers in jails.
We have denied systemic racism, and we have perpetuated it.
We have taken money from the poor to enrich the wealthy.
We have caused violence.
We have thrown innocent men and women in prison.
We have pressed a knee on the neck of an unarmed Black man for eight minutes and 46 seconds until he died, and we have allowed a society in which crimes like this are too often unpunished.
I imagine that some might push back: Am I really guilty of Harvey Weinstein's or Bill Cosby's crimes? Am I to blame for the Trump administration's policy of separating children from their mothers? Can you blame me for street violence? Or hate crimes? The direct victims of these sins are not to blame for what was heaped upon them. But most of us could do more, much more. We are all like Oskar Schindler at the end of Steven Spielberg's film. ""I didn't do enough,"" he says with guilt and anguish.
Imagine that we, newly armed with a sense of collective culpability and responsibility, approach this autumn with the understanding that the world's problems are intrinsic to our lives and our communities. Imagine if we approach our local, state, and national elections with a greater urgency to confront ourselves and politicians to work harder to create a more perfect union of empathy, shared responsibility, and love.

It's game on. The political collision course over the Supreme Court is going forward. President Trump set to announce his nominee on Saturday, and Senate Republicans say they have the numbers to hold a vote.
The partisan infighting is just getting started. Here's just a small sample of what will likely be the nastiest confirmation fight we have ever seen.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Leader McConnell has defiled the Senate like no one in this generation.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: None of them assert this majority would be breaking any Senate rule by holding this vote. It is just that our Democratic friends where they might not like the outcome.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What Senator McConnell is putting the Senate through now is so destructive.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: After Kavanaugh, everything changed with me. They're not going to intimidate me, Mitchell McConnell or anybody else.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: And that back-and-forth is just the beginning. Democrats making all kinds of threats to try to stop Republicans, that includes Nancy Pelosi doubling down on potentially impeaching the president.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What is your power to do this? I get the election, but you -- you can get up more -- you can speak out more. You can do more impeachments, things like that. Do you have enough power?
NANCY PELOSI, HOUSE SPEAKER: Well, we can impeach him every day of the week for anything he does. In fact --
(CROSSTALK)
PELOSI: Well, because -- look, American people want to know what we are doing that affects them directly.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: And President Trump says bring it on.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: They want to impeach me again if I nominate somebody as -- Constitutionally obligated to do to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States. Go ahead. I want them to do that. I want them to do that.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: So Republicans were holding their breath the last 48 hours. And then Gardner, Alexander, and then today, Dana, Mitt Romney, I mean, I think everything is falling into place, it looks like.
DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: You kind of have to love Mitch McConnell who has the votes. And yet, is so calm and doesn't, you know, dance in the end zone or --
(CROSSTALK)
PERINO: He's just calm, right? So he's like, yeah, I got the votes. And we'll have a vote. And he was very calm. And meanwhile, you have Schumer and Durbin and other Democrats outside with the poster board, you know, the old fashioned poster board, trying to say the McConnell is wrong on process. And McConnell wins that argument. So I think that was a huge game changer.
I do think that there will be a vote this year. I actually think it could be before the election, because in some ways, why wait.
WATTERS: Right.
PERINO: And also, I think when it comes to the Senate races that are on the line, and that is on the line. It helps Democrats in a couple but probably helps Republicans in more than it hurts for -- hurts them, probably four seats for Republicans and probably helps them have this fight.
WATTERS: Greg, did you know that Mitchell McConnell has defiled the Senate by holding this vote?
GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: What a verb. Put it -- a Democrat would know what defiling is. I mean, look at their cities. Dana, Happy Halloween. So I looked at the list of all the nominees, and they're all women, right? And we all have to accept that. It's like they're all -- there's going to be no guy, and that's not sexist, right? It's just that assume that it's going to be all women.
But there's one woman that is not on the list, hello, Judge Jeanine, right, right? I mean, if you are going to fill that seat -- I want her to be nominated because I have the title for her next book, which would be Courtrooms, Criminals, and Crooks, My Time as a Supreme Court Justice in Donald Trump's America.
WATTERS: Yes.
GUTFELD: Yes. OK, so to the impeachment thing -- you know what impeachment is for the Democrats and the media? It's the genie lamp that they keep rubbing, like assuming the impeachment is actually going to come out of the lamp. But those lamps only exist in cartoons like Aladdin. I'm pretty sure. The Republicans should continue to employ the GFY of strategy, which is go after yourself.
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: -- you guys have been smearing us for five years, calling us names. You keep threatening us. Why is -- when are you going to be nicer to us if we don't do this?
WATTERS: We expect that language out of Dana, not you.
GUTFELD: The bottom line is if you got the ball, you've got to score. That's all you got to do.
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: Let's go to Juan. Juan, what is there -- I know. I know.
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: -- not only that, but we go back to defile, because I think -- I was glad that he didn't tell us what that means. That's all what I'm saying.
WATTERS: Can the Democrats do anything procedurally at all to slow down or stop what it looks like is coming in the Senate?
WILLIAMS: I don't see it, Jesse. I think that what we learned today is that the Republicans are going to stack the Supreme Court. They're going to have a 6-3 majority. And I don't think there's much they can do about it. In the short run, Trump will use this. The big question is how does it affect the presidential race? Because I think right now, it looks like, as everyone said, McConnell has the votes and he intends to use his power.
It's brutish, but he's going to do it. I think it really does hurt the institution. But so be it. That's the way it is in (Inaudible) polarized political system at the moment. But I say it's how -- it affects the presidential race. And right now, I think the president is using to distract from his primary liability, which is his failure to deal with Coronavirus.
So, you know, today we learned 200,000 plus have died from Coronavirus in this country. And I think right now, he doesn't have, you know, he doesn't have any answers. And I think, you know, the added vote on the court, given that there is an Obamacare -- case coming up right at the week after the election. So I think pre-existing conditions and the like right there on the ballot for Democrats to see.
He said because it's, you know, young people are not going to get sick. Healthy people are not going to -- we know he's wrong. I think he knows he's wrong. He told Bob Woodward he's wrong, but he says this stuff. You know, to me, that's why -- you know, I think this former Pence aide, this young woman who came out and said, you know what, I can't do it, I quit.
And then she said Trump said, oh yeah, I'm glad to have Coronavirus because it means I don't have to shake hands. I think people should pay attention.
(CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: And you paraphrased him completely incorrectly. As for the 200,000, that was a prediction that was even made by experts after you flatten the curve.
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: If you flatten the curve --
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: -- between one to two million. And by the way, replacing -- filling a vacancy isn't stacking the court, right? We know what stacking the court really is. It's adding more judges, OK?
WILLIAMS: No. Stacking is when we don't let Democrats legitimately nominate a candidate --
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: the president nominated Garland, the Senate just didn't --
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: There's a difference --
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: Six weeks out. You say --
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: Dagen, let's let Dagen get in here. Juan says it's a distraction -- that he's talking about this vacancy on the court from COVID-19. I see it as him fulfilling his constitutional obligation to nominate someone to fill that vacancy. What do you say?
DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS HOST: You know who controls the power of the purse (ph), the Congress and Nancy Pelosi. So where the hell is she in passing a new stimulus bill? There's a compromise -- bipartisan compromise, $1.5 trillion. You're going to get, what, $450 extra per week in unemployment benefits? There are -- more than 12 and a half million of people just collecting extra state employment benefits.
Extra $1200 checks, half a trillion dollars to the states, the blue states, the leaders of which don't know how to do math. Nancy Pelosi is talking about impeachment. Where is she on this? She left town. And she left unemployed Americans, millions of them in the lurch. She left town residents passing even a small, a skinny bill. And I've been thinking about this.
Why are the Democrats huffing and puffing so much and caterwauling about the hypocrisy, like, pulling their shirt collars? Because they got themselves into this, this is pure misdirected outrage and self-loathing. It started with Harry Reid seven years ago, got rid of the filibuster. Then Donald J. Trump beat Hillary Clinton.
He's going to have three Supreme Court Justices appointed in his first term, potentially. And then you have -- the Senate is in a better position because of the four Democratic senators who voted nay on Justice Kavanaugh. They lost their seats. So Mitch McConnell is in a better place. So you know what, I would be hating myself, too, if I was a Democrat, because here we are.
WATTERS: The self-loathing Democrats, more on that. Coming up, Sleepy Joe ignoring the Supreme Court fight to focus on COVID, will that end up costing him? That's next on THE FIVE.
MCDOWELL: Welcome back. Joe Biden ignoring the Supreme Court fight on the campaign trail yesterday. Instead, the former VP focusing on blaming President Trump for the pandemic like he's been doing for months. It looks like the strategy is already starting to backfire. Biden is refusing to even answer questions about who he would nominate for the Supreme Court, President Trump quickly using that to his advantage.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: They don't want to show the judges, because the only ones that he can put in are far left radicals. And if he does something even toward the left of center, which would be acceptable, I guess, we have no choice. If he did that, he would lose the left. So he's going to have to put in radicals, so he doesn't want to show who his judges are. He doesn't want to do that.
Because if you found out who he was going to pick, he would be unelectable. Hopefully, he's going to be unelectable anyway.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MCDOWELL: Dana, does this hurt Biden?
PERINO: The Supreme Court thing, possibly. Well, let's see. I think it helps Trump. And Trump needed a little bit of a boost, right? So for Joe Biden, this election is all about COVID-19, everything. And he ties everything to it, right, the economy, healthcare, jobs, racial injustice. Everything about his campaign, he can tie back to COVID-19.
So I can understand why his campaign is saying let's just stick to our knitting. It's been working for us. Let's just keep going in this direction. But news happens. A little September surprise, we don't know what October could bring. I think -- I don't blame Joe Biden for not releasing a list of names, probably for what President Trump says, right?
Because there is a fractious Democratic Party and you have a center left group, and then you have progressives. No matter who he puts out there, they're not going to be satisfactory. Plus, the conservatives had a long history of working on judicial nominations. And so they had a list that President Trump was very willing to put forward.
The thing about for Joe Biden is if he wants to make the case about COVID- 19 and make this election a referendum on COVID-19, then he should do it. But that means that he has to make the case. And yesterday, he tried to do that on a day when everyone's talking about the Supreme Court this morning. They called the lid at like 9:15 in the morning, which means that you're not going to see the candidate for the rest of the day.
They're not out there making the case. So if he wants to make it about Coronavirus, fine. But you still have to get out there and do it. You can't just expect millions of people to come to their own conclusion.
MCDOWELL: Well, I think that that's why they're staying on Coronavirus, Juan, because he does really well in polling, just on fighting the pandemic. But he needs to justify the fact he's been locked up in his house and not really doing much for months and months and months, and that's his only excuse.
WILLIAMS: Well, I don't know. I don't know. But I do know about today, Dagen. And I think the reason he put a lid on early was because he had two fundraisers. He wants to maintain what is now an advantage in terms of cash on hand.
(CROSSTALK)
PERINO: -- I mean, Hillary Clinton had more money than Trump.
WILLIAMS: Right. But I think that right now he wants to maintain an advantage on the cash funds, so he had two fundraisers. It's not that he was an active. But, you know, just to get back to the topic you started on, Dagen. I think not having a list, in my experience, is normal. I think what's abnormal is Trump committing to a list, and a list provided by a conservative legal group, the Federalist Society, it's incredible.
I don't know if people realize that if Trump gets another person on the court, six of the nine people on the Supreme Court will have been recommended and are members of one group, the Federalist Society.
PERINO: What an accomplishment.
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: -- no, it wasn't you. It was President Trump, Dana, who said, oh, he's afraid. You know, because if he puts a list out with all these far left people, wait a minute. Have you seen the Federalist Society?
(CROSSTALK)
MCDOWELL: That's a talking point from Senator Sheldon Whitehouse because he's trying to smear the people who are on --
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: That's no smear. That's just the truth.
MCDOWELL: Yes, it is.
WILLIAMS: How's that a smear? Is it a truth? Is it a fact? It's a fact.
PERINO: The Federalist Society is like the Chamber of Commerce for lawyers.
MCDOWELL: Jesse.
WATTERS: I would say the story right now is that Biden is beholden to his radical base. And he got elected because he went just far enough in the primary to say, you know what, have those people think we can control the sky, because he went so far left on taxes, immigration, healthcare, and trade. And so after that, the Democrat base went so far left with the riots.
And now, they are saying they want to pack the court. Biden is stunned into silence. Biden didn't say anything about the riots all summer, Biden who was always kind of a law and order Democrat, is now saying nothing about that. And he said in June he was going to release a list of names for the Supreme Court. So there was going to be a list of black women.
And now, he is saying he's not going to say that. And a year ago, he's on tape saying that I don't think we should pack the court. But now, when he's asked that question, he says, no, I don't want to say anything. This is going to give Trump ammunition. The reason he's not saying anything, and Trump is right. If he says we will pack the court. That just admits he's the Trojan horse for the radical left.
If he says no, we will not pack the court, which I believe he believes in. That depresses his base and they don't turn out. And it exposes the rift that's there. And that rift is being exposed right now. There's only one candidate that has a strong consolidated base right now. That's Donald Trump.
MCDOWELL: Greg?
GUTFELD: I love how the Dems do manipulate words, like packing the court is now called reform, right? But what is packing the court? It's basically adding more referees onto the field that are actually on your team. It's a flaw that anybody could exploit. So whoever is in power could just pack more judges under the court. It's a flaw that probably should be changed.
But the way they are framing it, they are framing it as reform by actually packing the court. And to the COVID thing, what drives me crazy is that the Democrats have first came out with this line of reasoning that we shouldn't be politicizing the virus, even though they called the travel ban racist because they hate Donald Trump.
And then they tried to hold up the funding because it's Donald Trump. And now, who is politicizing COVID? Joe Biden, it's his entire campaign. And I think that Trump has got to fight back on this, because the two -- you see everybody in the media is like 200,000, 200,000 in the prediction. That was the low end. It was like 140-200 if you did everything right. If you didn't do anything, it was two million.
So Donald Trump could actually argue that. If you are going to say I killed 200,000 people, I could say I saved 1.8 million lives. Because it's essentially the same argument, it's un-provable, because you don't have a parallel universe where Joe Biden or a Democrat was president, so nothing they say could be proved.
In fact, I guarantee you in a week they will say that Donald Trump had Justice Ginsburg killed. That's how crazy -- they are running out of crazy stuff to say. I'm going to help them with that completely absurd suggestion.
MCDOWELL: Up next, Joe Biden, he has a major blind spot, the one thing that Democrats fear could cost him the election.
WILLIAMS: President Trump getting ready for a big rally in Pittsburgh tonight, while Joe Biden off the campaign trail. It comes as all eyes turn to the big debate one week from tonight. Some Biden allies now concerned a poor performance could hurt him. A new article from The Atlantic saying, quote, ""almost every Democratic operative I've spoken with in the past few weeks remains petrified that Biden is going to bungle the debates in a way that costs him the election"", end quote.
Jesse, I'm thinking to myself, boy, those Democrats, they're sneaky. Are they are trying to lower expectations for Biden?
WATTERS: Probably. Juan, I've been following presidential debates since I was 18 in 1996. I've seen, like, 18 presidential debates. Only two times has the media declared the Republican the winner. Once, the first debate between Bush and Gore, when I was sighing heavily into the microphone, and then that first Obama-Romney debate, where Romney just decimated him.
And Obama seemed very bewildered. So according to history, Joe Biden will be deemed the winner of this debate no matter what happens. Yes, he's been debating for 47 years. I wouldn't say it was that difficult to beat this crop in the spring. How hard is it to debate a socialist? It's not that hard. But remember, he used to walk out on stage with bloody eyeballs.
He got cold cocked by Kamala. He confused his own website. He called Bernie Sanders President Sanders. I wouldn't say it was a strong performance. And here's is his weakness when he goes against the president, and he has to have been practicing because when he calls lids (ph) every other day. He goes out there. He gets very defensive when he has to defend his record, very angry and very frazzled.
That's where Trump will pressure him right there. He's also not quick on his feet. He doesn't have these quick retorts that the president has. All he'll say is come on, man. And oh, he's lying. But he won't be able to specifically counter that. And also, he's not having a strong field at the base. He doesn't know how his base feels about fracking or healthcare for illegals.
So there are kind of things where you're unsure. You make a lot of unforced errors. Then lastly, these debates are won in these kinds of moments, these viral moments. Trump creates the viral moments. Joe Biden does not have a history of creating those memorable moments that go viral and decide these big moments.
WILLIAMS: All right. So Greg, we were talking earlier about COVID. So is it reasonable to think Trump is going to have to produce something about Coronavirus? Is he going to have to say here's my plan?
GUTFELD: Well, he has already. But I mean, to the point that -- Joe Biden's expectations are so low for his performance, that if he shows up in the bathrobe isn't open, he wins. But this -- I think -- now to your point about COVID, OK? I think that -- if this debate doesn't go off the rails in the first 10 minutes, I will be shocked because of what Biden says about Trump.
His entire plank is about Trump, right? Trump is a murderer, to the COVID thing. Do you think Trump is going to let that slide? Trump is going to have to be, like, this is the first time he's ever had to defend his record in a debate. So he's got this guy who's basically got nothing but you're a murderer. You're a racist with the fine people hoax. You drink Clorox.
He's going to say these -- it's up to Trump to match every one of those things with a fist, you know, metaphorically speaking, right back at Joe. Because -- if not, I think that Joe has a chance. But he's going to have to fact-check Joe.
WILLIAMS: All right. Well, Dagen, you're our financial expert. Now, what'll Trump do in terms of saying to the American people I know how to fix this economy.
MCDOWELL: Well, it goes back to his record before the pandemic shut down, where you had incredible gains in incomes. You had the poverty rate at the lowest level in 60 years. And work -- like, working men and women were making more money than even their bosses. He will focus on that.
He'll focus on the private sector getting a vaccine out where you're going to have probably the entire population of the United States vaccinated maybe by the middle of next year.
But all Trump has to do is some rope a dope. This debate is not won or lost for Joe Biden in the first 30 minutes, it's the last 30 minutes where his mind starts wandering and the briefing books have gone right out of both of his ears, and he's starting to think about that bedtime snack and that hot cup of cocoa. You go back and read some -- read the transcripts, I won't bore you. Read the transcripts of what Joe Biden, some of the answers toward the end of debates, their doozies. Remember the record player?
GUTFELD: How long is the debate? Do we know?
PERINO: An hour and a half, I think.
WILLIAMS: Yes, 90 minutes, 90 minutes.
GUTFELD: They should make it three hours.
WILLIAMS: So, Dana, the court is going to come up and the whole issue of the additional justice. And so, I imagine they might say to Donald Trump, do you want to overturn Roe v. Wade. What does he say?
PERINO: Well, I think that he'll say that if that case comes before the Supreme Court, I'm confident that the court will rule based on the rule of law, etcetera, etcetera. I think that he'll have an answer for that. I think on some of this is that remember, there won't be an audience. And I think that that is different. I think it's better for people that are watching so that you can -- there's no cheers or jeers, and so it is just the two of them.
Sometimes these viral moments aren't actually anything spoken. It could be the sigh, or remember, was it 41 that was looking at the watch, and then that was bad. And then do you remember Al Gore like came up to like, try to like, invade 43 space and he's like, looks at him. That's like that was the moment of the debate. It was like, who the heck do you think you are?
I don't know if they'll be able to do that with -- in this moment. We'll see. But I also think that Democrats, by putting this out there now, they call them bedwetting Democrats. They are so nervous. They have they always do this. I was I was listening to David Axelrod's podcast where he was talking about, they're always nervous that you're not going to have enough money. He does have enough money. You're not going to have ground game. They do have the ground game. He's not going to do this. He's not going to do that. And it's just a little bit too much of a worrywart syndrome.
WILLIAMS: All right. Coming up, a CNN host calls to ""blow up the entire (INAUDIBLE).
GUTFELD: As President Trump prepares to fill a seat, Don Lemon fills his diaper.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CHRIS CUOMO, ANCHOR, CNN: No matter what happens, everybody sticks with their team.
DON LEMON, ANCHOR, CNN: We're going to have to blow up the entire system. And you know what we're going to have to do?
CUOMO: Yes, I don't know about it.
LEMON: You know, Oregon? You know what we have to do you?
CUOMO: You just got to vote.
LEMON: Honestly, from what your closing argument is, you're going to have to get rid of the Electoral College.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Yes. Extremism is in at CNN, a symptom of cognitive failure. For to hold such extreme notions, you must embrace the irrational. As for real problems, just deny. Yes, the guy who wants to destroy the system actually denies it when people are actually destroying the system. Remember, there's no crime because we dined in New York City.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
LEMON: We went out and had a great dinner in New York City tonight. People actually walked up to us and said thank you for -- I watch you every night. I can't believe. They thought they didn't do a double take at as actually hanging out and not seeing us on the T.V. screen. But New York City was not, you know, hellscape was it?
CUOMO: I mean, that one guy ran by with the machete who tried to get -- no, of course, it isn't.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Nice journalism there, champ. No wonder CNN is now just weekly world news with Botox. Hey, I didn't get stabbed. Waiter, more Pino. This is the same guy who mocked the mayhem until the polls mocked him.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
LEMON: Democratic cities are in chaos right now. Is this what you want from Joe Biden? And they're going to take your country away and they're taking down the statues and --
CUOMO: Crime is rising, and they'll defund police.
LEMON: Crime is rising. Oh, my gosh, it's so bad.
The rioting has to stop. Chris, as you know and I know, it's showing up in the polling.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: So, the stats, the crimes, the victims, the torch city blocks, they don't exist until the polling says so. Worse, after forever denying provable violence, they still scream about an imagined hell that will come if Trump does X or Y. But these apocalypses never come unless they themselves create them. Meaning, they use their premise of a future Trumpian hell to validate the actual hell their own business model creates.
They envision Trump destroying society, but they're doing the real work excusing the real chaos, which happened. Here's a summary.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Nationwide unrest sparked by the police killing of George Floyd could lead to the highest insurance payout of its kind in history. Damage from looting and arson will cost one to $2 billion in claims.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They took everything. They took medications like in a patient medications that we had. The empty all the shelves. They destroyed our computer system.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) this new bar in a restaurant. This was like a dream. In the last 48 hours, it just -- everything just disappeared. It's gone.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: As crime surges, citizens flee cities and the police resign. We know what's coming. And when it comes, you know who will still be calling it a peaceful protest from a secure location? Pino in one hand, 9/11 on speed dial in the other.
So I'm always amazed, Dagen, that the Democrats can imagine this incredible apocalypse from everything Trump does, which never happens. Why the stuff that's actually raging, nothing to see here.
MCDOWELL: Well, because they only talk to themselves. They live in that echo chamber. You only need to go into the streets of New York City and ask people, hey, you know, anybody who's been assaulted in the last week? Hey, you know, anybody whose car has been stolen. And this bears -- this is in the numbers.
Now, I'm not going to sit here and quote statistics. But the reason that the liberals and the left-wing lemmings and the media want to shut you up and basically act like all victims are lying, because it doesn't fit their political narrative. And people are -- in the Democratic Party, they're worried because in this city, with the bail reform, no enforcement of quality life crimes, disbanding of the plainclothes street crime units, you name it, that's created a surge in crime.
They have turned their backs, these idiots, on the people who live here. It is coming to other cities. This is a place with the left-wing leaders, they coddle criminals, and they allow violent protests to just run amok. And it is coming for other cities because guess who's in favor of bail reform? Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
GUTFELD: Yes. Jesse, I'm sure you have montage envy.
JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: That was pretty good, Gutfeld. I did like how Lemon use that as an opportunity to say he was recognized at dinner. I hope you guys caught that one.
GUTFELD: That's true.
WATTERS: In New York City, imagine. Listen, Greg, they've been lying and leaking. They've been unmasking and borking, and boycotting, and doing all kinds of crazy stuff. But now, now, they're going to blow up the system.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: Like, what have they been doing? Like, where we've been seeing them do this. So just 10 years ago, Barack Obama, he had the White House, the Democrats had the Senate, they had the House. He's won the Electoral College twice. He's put two people on the Supreme Court justices. The Supreme Court ruled for gay marriage. Like everything was good, right?
PERINO: The system was great.
WATTERS: The system worked fine. Then the Republicans, they said, you know what, let's get the people to help us get our power back, and they did that within the system. They didn't try to blow it up. So, what we have now is this. The Democrats are like a football team that keeps losing, and they want to blame the rules. And they asked their fans to say, hey, we're playing fine. The coaches are doing great. It's the rules that are causing us to lose. And the stupid fans, AKA Democratic voters, they're going along with it. They're saying, yes, it's the rules, it's not the terrible players and the coaches.
GUTFELD: What do you think, Juan, what Jesse just said.
WILLIAMS: Well, before I get to Jesse, let me just say, you guys talk about, you know, anarchy chaos in the streets. And I think, wow, Donald Trump has nothing to do with this spike in hate crimes under which president?
GUTFELD: He didn't loot my neighbor.
WILLIAMS: Oh, Donald Trump. How about this? Now, what does the FBI --
GUTFELD: How do you -- you have to link it, Juan.
WILLIAMS: Hang on. Hang on. Let me finish. What does the FBI say is the number one threat, domestic terrorist or in country? White supremacy is what --
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: Did hate crimes cause $2 billion in damage? Did they cause $2 billion in damage, Juan?
WILLIAMS: No, you guys don't want to hear this because it's just so plain to everybody. What a divisive president. What a divisive president.
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: But let me just say -- I want to go back to your monologue, because I think you're missing something here. I think you don't understand how frustrated people on the left are, Democrats, at the idea, for example, that, you know, the Republicans are the majority of the Senate, but actually Democrats represent 40 million more people in this country in terms of their democratic minority in that senate. You don't understand how --
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: Hang on. Hang on. You don't understand how frustrated Democrats are that they have won, I believe it's four of the last five elections in terms of popular vote, but guess what, the game gets changed because of this or that. And suddenly, Republicans are in the White House with the exception of the two Obama elections.
So when it comes to saying how do we deal with racial justice, how do we deal with economy economic issues? Hey, Democrats say wait a minute, this is a tyranny. We never get a voice. The Republicans who are a minority of the voters are in fact dominating this democracy.
WATTERS: Juan, it's not a tyranny, it's a constitutional republic.
WILLIAMS: Oh, yes.
WATTERS: Those rules about the government, they've never changed. They've been in place since the 1700s. To complain now because you're out of power, just looks like you're being a whiner.
WILLIAMS: No, it doesn't. It looks to me like you're saying this country has changed and we need to address it because right now we're allowing the minority to rule over a majority.
WATTERS: No, no. You've changed. The country stayed the same.
WILLIAMS: The country has not stayed the same. Most Americans don't live in the country anymore.
WATTERS: Juan, the Senate has been there since the 1700s. Don't complain now when you're out of power.
WILLIAMS: And you're a farmer? Are you a farmer? Are you a farmer? That's what Americans were back then.
WATTERS: No, but I go to Whole Foods. I love Whole Foods.
PERINO: I can make it quick.
GUTFELD: It's so great to back together.
PERINO: You know, I love the Electoral College and I can do a whole thing on it, but I won't. I was (INAUDIBLE) right now. I would just say this. Do you remember when Sarah Palin said that she had targeted sites for --
GUTFELD: Right.
PERINO: Right? And then the media said, oh, she is targeting actual people for violence.
GUTFELD: Right.'
PERINO: Or when President Trump has done some of these memes and they're funny but they're like he's inciting violence. When they say that they're going to blow up the entire system, nobody bats an eye.
GUTFELD: Yes, especially after all the -- all these cities are burning. Bad language, Don. So, what's it really like being back in studio? We'll tell you next.
PERINO: So, we are thrilled to be back in the studio, but we're still getting used to the new set. We're a little far apart so we won't take it around the semi-circle. I love the idea yesterday of the Lazy Susan for food to like come around. What about you, Greg?
GUTFELD: I don't know. I feel bad for all those women named Susan.
PERINO: Yes.
GUTFELD: But what's great about this distance, I don't have to shower. You guys can't smell me which is really, really good. But although I do feel like that I'm having to yell when I don't have to.
PERINO: Yes, we're good.
GUTFELD: Because we're far away and I'm yelling and everybody can see my shoes, there were better lit so I have to make better shoe choices.
PERINO: Those are pretty good ones.
GUTFELD: I loved these.
PERINO: I mean they're wrapped with green duct tapes.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: Why do they have duct tape?
GUTFELD: These are Garcon.
PERINO: That was the fashion.
WATTERS: You are a man of the people, Greg.
GUTFELD: Really?
WATTERS: Expensive French shoes. That was French, was it?
GUTFELD: I got in Japan.
WATTERS: OK.
PERINO: Anything you would do different, Jesse, on the set?
WATTERS: The only thing that worries me with the distance is because, you know, we used to have a thing, Dana. When I was about to say something controversial, I would ask for you to hold my hand and squeeze it. We can't reach anymore. I have a solution.
PERINO: OK.
WATTERS: Before I say something controversial, I'm going to ask you to squeeze my -- what do I call this?
GUTFELD: I don't know. Is it a can grabber?
WATTERS: OK, maybe you should -- yes.
GUTFELD: A can grabber.
PERINO: Do we put this around your neck, or how does it work?
WATTERS: Yes. Many people would like that.
PERINO: All right, Juan, what about you? I like a -- I need a pointer stick.
WILLIAMS: A pointer stick. I think that's for picking up trash, isn't it?
WATTERS: That's right.
WILLIAMS: Yes.
WATTERS: You know what, De Blasio won't do it, so I'm going to --
WILLIAMS: I know. I know.
PERINO: A do it yourself city.
WILLIAMS: No. Well, I mean, actually, this is fine with me. I think it's kind of interesting. And I like the conversation when -- as a group. I think the dynamic is good.
PERINO: How about you, Dagen?
MCDOWELL: I have problems with my posture, so this chair is not good for me.
PERINO: I know.
MCDOWELL: In real life, I look like Mr. Burns, like this. And clearly, I was feeling overconfident because I chose this dress. It's not a good pick.
PERINO: I think it's a good pick.
WILLIAMS: Yes.
PERINO: We're working on it.
GUTFELD: Do you know how I pick up trash, Dana? Beer and cigarettes.
PERINO: All right, ""ONE MORE THING"" is up next.
WATTERS: It's time now for ""ONE MORE THING."" Dana?
PERINO: OK, it's time for this.
WATTERS: Yes.
PERINO: Corny jokes. I have them over from yesterday because they are so good. These are New York related, OK.
GUTFELD: Oh, great.
PERINO: Coming back to New York related. Number one. Why did Eve move from the Garden of Eden to New York City?
GUTFELD: Great ribs?
WILLIAMS: Big Apple.
WATTERS: Big Apple.
PERINO: Yes. Very good. Juan is good at these. Where does Dwayne Johnson go when he visits the city?
WATTERS: Rockefeller Center.
PERINO: 30 Rock.
WATTERS: Darn it.
WILLIAMS: No, you got it.
WATTERS: Oh, it was perfect.
PERINO: Why did all the Staten Island's girls' wishes come true?
GUTFELD: Because there's a fairy there.
PERINO: Yes, fairy god mother. How does the honey enthusiasts get around the city?
GUTFELD: Takes the B.
PERINO: Yes, the B train. I know you guys would do well. Where do Trump supporters go when they visit New York?
WILLIAMS: Wall Street.
PERINO: Yes, very good.
WATTERS: Oh, Juan.
PERINO: OK, the last one. Where did I get these amazing jokes?
WATTERS: I don't know.
PERINO: Come on. Corny Islands.
WATTERS: Oh, that was really good.
WILLIAMS: I like -- I like the New York thing.
PERINO: You guys are good.
WILLIAMS: You know what -- you know what my favorite New York joke is? I think it's Jeff Garlin, you know that comedian? He says New York's the only city in the world where you -- a smell can wake you up.
GUTFELD: Or kill you.
PERINO: That's true. I'm not kidding. Walk a mile.
WATTERS: All right, let's do some mom text.
PERINO: Well, all good stuff today.
WATTERS: All right, now that we're back in studio. Number one, ""Your comments about voting by mail are inaccurate and entirely irresponsible. You are giving credence to Trump's undermining of a process and behaving like his pawn."" Number two, ""You'd better put your tie back on and trim the mullet."" And I did. I definitely did.
PERINO: She was right.
WATTERS: Number three. ""Greg does look exactly like a middle school math teacher."" Remember that? Let's see him. Yes, there he is.
GUTFELD: I do.
WATTERS: You did. And number four, ""Jesse, do not denigrate experts. You sound like Trump. And let's please remember you are not an expert regarding the virus. Listen and hush."" Oh, I got a hush.
GUTFELD: Yes. You'd be unemployed if you did that.
WATTERS: Oh, yes. Greg?
GUTFELD: All right. Let's do this thing of a jig.

WATTERS: What is that?
GUTFELD: It's like an ASMR video for dogs. Anyway, I've been watching this before I go to bed and you know what, it works. But the dreams I'm having, kinky. Anyway --

WILLIAMS: Yes. You remember Sammy Davis thinking about the Candy Man? Well, I've got a real-life nominee for the title of today's Candy Man. Take a look at Keith Tordoff. He owns the oldest candy store in England. But according to Guinness, it's the oldest sweet shop in the world dating back to 1827. Mr. Tordoff is a retired policeman. He took over the business with his wife 25 years ago. The building goes back to the 1600s. And during the pandemic, the store has been doing booming business. Now, that's today's real-life Candy Man. It's so sweet.
PERINO: Nice.
WATTERS: All right, Dagen McDowell.
MCDOWELL: Since we -- with the passing of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, I wanted to give a woman who changed my life a thank you on national T.V. Barbara Bass was my math teacher in high school. And she looked at me and said Miss McDowell, I know where you're from. Pull your head up. You're not stupid, you're just uneducated.
And she changed that, changed my life.

During a four-hour service broadcast live on every major US television network from a church in Floyd's boyhood home of Houston, family members, clergy and politicians exhorted Americans to turn grief and outrage at his death into a moment of reckoning for the nation.
The funeral followed two weeks of protests ignited by graphic video footage of Floyd, 46, handcuffed and lying face down on a Minneapolis street while an officer kneels into the back of his neck for nearly nine minutes. The video shows Floyd gasping for air as he cries out, ""Mama,"" and groans, ""Please, I can't breathe,"" before falling silent and still.
The officer, Derek Chauvin, 44, has since been charged with second-degree murder and three other officers with aiding and abetting Floyd's May 25 death. All were dismissed from the department a day after the incident.
Floyd's dying words have become a rallying cry for hundreds of thousands of protesters around the globe who have since taken to the streets, undaunted by the coronavirus pandemic, demanding justice for Floyd and an end to mistreatment of minorities by U.S. law enforcement.
""I can breathe. And as long as I'm breathing, justice will be served,"" Floyd's niece Brooklyn Williams declared in a eulogy that drew applause from mourners inside the Fountain of Praise Church. ""This is not just a murder but a hate crime.""
'BIG FLOYD' Williams was one of several relatives and friends who addressed the service, remembering Floyd as a loving, larger-than-life personality. The memorial was punctuated by gospel music and a video montage of shared memories of the man affectionately known as ""Big Floyd.""
His younger brother, Terrence Floyd, spoke about awakening in the middle of the night in recent days traumatized by the memory of seeing his older sibling calling out for their mother as he lay dying.
His older brother, Philonise, sobbing in grief, told mourners, ""George was my personal superman.""
Civil rights activist the Rev. Al Sharpton called Floyd ""an ordinary brother"" who grew up in a housing project but left behind a legacy of greatness despite rejections in jobs and sports that prevented him from achieving all that he once aspired to become.
""God took the rejected stone and made him the cornerstone of a movement that is going to change the whole wide world,"" Sharpton said, invoking a biblical parable from the New Testament.
Sharpton said the Floyd family would lead a march on Washington being organized for Aug. 28 to mark the 57th anniversary of the 1963 ""I Have a Dream"" speech given from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial by civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., who was assassinated in 1968.
'HOME-GOING CELEBRATION'
Some 2,500 people attended the funeral, after more than 6,000 people filed past Floyd's open casket on Monday.
Two columns of uniformed Houston police officers saluted the golden casket as it was wheeled from the hearse into the church before the service. A horse-drawn carriage later bore the coffin on its last mile to the cemetery in Pearland, Texas, where Floyd was buried in a private ceremony.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate in the Nov. 3 election, addressed the funeral service via a video recording, lamenting that ""too many black Americans wake up knowing that they could lose their life in the course of just living their life.""
""We must not turn away. We cannot leave this moment thinking we can once again turn away from racism,"" he said.
Two voter registration tables were set up outside the church.
MOURNING FAMILIES Among those in attendance were loved ones of several other black men killed by white police or white civilians.
The mother of Eric Garner, the New York man who died in a police chokehold in 2014, was present, as was the family of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Georgia man who was shot and killed in February while jogging. Three white men were charged in his death.
Fallout from Floyd's death, and reaction to a spate of arson and looting that accompanied some of the otherwise mostly peaceful protests, also plunged President Donald Trump into one of the biggest crises of his tenure.
Hundreds of protesters packed Seattle's city hall late Tuesday night, chanting demands for the resignation of the mayor and the defunding the police force.
Days after Seattle's mayor and police chief promised a month-long moratorium on tear gas, the department used it again on protesters overnight Sunday, bringing severe criticism.
A Republican, Trump repeatedly threatened to order the military onto the streets to quell protests, focusing on restoring order while saying little about the U.S. racial wounds at the root of the upheavals.

A document, ""Joe Biden's Agenda for the Indian American Community,"" issued by his campaign on Saturday outlining his stand on issues of interest to those citizens said that Biden will introduce several immigration reforms that could benefit Indians, who face decades-long backlogs, and modernise the H1-B and other work-based visas for highly qualified professionals.
The document said, ""No common global challenge can be solved without India and the United States working as responsible partners.""
""Biden believes there can be no tolerance for terrorism in South Asia - cross-border or otherwise,"" the agenda said.
""A Biden administration will also work with India to support a rules-based and stable Indo-Pacific region in which no country, including China, is able to threaten its neighbours with impunity,"" it added.
Unlike communal appeals to Muslims and Jewish people in religion-specific documents, there were no such Biden agendas for Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhist and Jains but only a general document directed at Indian Americans.
The Democratic Party's list of religious leaders who will be saying the opening prayers and giving the blessings at its convention sessions has only members of various Christian sects, the Jewish faith and Islam.
On bilateral relations with India, the Agenda for Indian American Communities noted that when Biden was the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 2007, he had said, ""My dream is that in 2020, the two closest nations in the world will be India and the United States.""
""Biden will deliver on his long-standing belief that India and the United States are natural partners, and a Biden administration will place a high priority on continuing to strengthen the US-India relationship,"" it said.
It added, ""Together, we will continue strengthening India's defence and capabilities as a counter-terrorism partner, improving health systems and pandemic response, and deepening cooperation in areas such as higher education, space exploration, and humanitarian relief.""
On issues directly impacting Indian Americans, the agenda said that ""Biden will ensure that South Asian Americans are represented in his administration, starting with his vice presidential nominee, Senator Kamala Harris, whose mother emigrated from India.""
On immigration, the agenda said that reforms that while supporting family-based immigration, increase the number of green cards for those qualifying based on employment, subject to ""macroeconomic conditions,"" the agenda said.
These reforms will cut the decades-long waits for visas, it said.
Any recent PhDs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields would be exempt from the limits on the number of green cards, it said.
Biden will also support reforming the the H1-B and other employment-based visa systems to ""protect wages and workers,"" the agenda said without providing further details.
It said that Biden will support a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants from India, who it said numbered 500,000.
Trump has proposed ending green cards for extended family members beyond the nuclear family, while introducing a merit-based system of immigration.
Biden's agenda said the work visas procedures for religious workers like priests and imams would be streamlined.
The Biden agenda offered direct federal protection for places of religious worship like temples, gurdwaras and mosques so that they don't have to depend on donations to ensure their safety.
The document mentioned the 2012 White supremacist attack on a Wisconsin gurdwara in which seven people were killed while he was vice president and the 2019 ""horrific act of vandalism"" against a Hindu temple in which a murti or sacred image was defaced, window broken and xenophobic messages painted.
It said that ""we cannot leave our faith-based organizations to rely on donations and internal fundraising efforts to guard against deadly attacks"" and said that Biden would ""ensure that places of worship have access to robust and direct security support from the federal government.""
The agenda accused Trump of encouraging and emboldening prejudice and hatred dangerously.
""Indian Americans of all backgrounds - Hindu, Sikh, Muslim, Jain, and others - have been subjected to bullying and xenophobic attacks and need now, more than ever, a reassurance that our leaders in Washington will have their backs,"" the agenda said.
A Biden administration would prioritise fighting hate crimes, ""confront White nationalist terrorism"" and increase penalties for hate crimes occurring in places of worship like ""gurudwaras, mandirs, temples, and mosques.""
The agenda directed towards Indian Americans offered that ""Biden will rescind Trump's 'Muslim ban' on day one,"" even though the restrictions by the Trump administration does not apply to all Muslims, but to citizens of all faiths from certain countries where there are problems with screening visa applicants.
India is not among those countries and there are no blanket bans on Indian Muslims.
The Agenda for Indian American Communities was silent on the Kashmir issue and the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which had been raised in his Agenda for Muslim American Communities.
In contrast, the document for Indian Americans was silent on the persecution or infringement of the rights of Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains and Christians in Muslim countries, whom the CAA sought to protect.
However, responding to the attack on a gurdwara in Afghanistan, had said in May, ""I stand with the Sikh and Hindu communities in Afghanistan seeking safety for their families and the freedom to practice their faiths.""
He had urged the Department of State to give them emergency refuge.

Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1107, I call up the resolution (H. Res. 908) condemning all forms of anti-Asian sentiment as related to COVID-19, and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Tlaib). Pursuant to House Resolution1107, the resolution is considered read. The text of the resolution is as follows: H. Res. 908 Whereas 23,000,000 Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders account for 7 percent of the Nation's population in the United States; Whereas over 2,000,000 Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are working on the frontlines of this COVID-19 pandemic in health care, law enforcement, first responders, transportation, supermarkets, and other service industries; Whereas the use of anti-Asian terminology and rhetoric related to COVID-19, such as the ``Chinese Virus'', ``Wuhan Virus'', and ``Kung-flu'' have perpetuated anti-Asian stigma; Whereas since January 2020, there has been a dramatic increase in reports of hate crimes and incidents against those of Asian descent; Whereas according to a recent study, there were over 400 cases related to COVID-19 anti-Asian discrimination between February 9, 2020, and March 7, 2020; Whereas the increased use of anti-Asian rhetoric has resulted in Asian Americans being harassed, assaulted, and scapegoated for the COVID-19 pandemic; Whereas in March 2020, anti-Asian violence includes: a woman wearing a mask was kicked and punched at a New York City subway station; two children and two adults were stabbed at a wholesale grocery in Midland, Texas; a couple was assaulted and robbed by a group of attackers in Philadelphia; and a 16-year-old boy was sent to the hospital after being attacked by bullies in Los Angeles, California; Whereas the increased use of anti-Asian rhetoric has also resulted in Asian-American businesses being targeted for vandalism; Whereas there are approximately 2 million Asian American- owned businesses that generate over $700 billion in annual revenue and employ nearly 4.5 million workers; Whereas the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recognize that naming COVID-19 by its geographic location or linking it to a specific ethnicity perpetuates stigma; Whereas in 2015, the WHO issued guidance calling on media outlets, scientists, and national authorities to avoid naming infectious diseases for locations to avoid stigmatizing groups of people; Whereas, on February 27, 2020, the Secretary of Health and Human Services stated ``ethnicity is not what causes the novel coronavirus'' and that it is inappropriate and inaccurate to call COVID-19 the ``Chinese virus''; Whereas, on February 28, 2020, Dr. Mitch Wolfe, the Chief Medical Officer of the CDC said, ``Stigma is the enemy of public health''; Whereas, on March 10, 2020, Dr. Robert Redfield, the Director of the CDC, testified that use of the term ``Chinese coronavirus'' is wrong and inappropriate; and Whereas the Secretary General of the United Nations called for international solidarity and an end to any ill-founded discrimination of the outbreak's victims: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives-- (1) calls on all public officials to condemn and denounce any and all anti-Asian sentiment in any form; (2) recognizes that the health and safety of all Americans, no matter their background, must be of utmost priority; (3) condemns all manifestations of expressions of racism, xenophobia, discrimination, anti-Asian sentiment, scapegoating, and ethnic or religious intolerance; (4) calls on Federal law enforcement officials, working with State and local officials-- (A) to expeditiously investigate and document all credible reports of hate crimes and incidents and threats against the Asian-American community in the United States; (B) to collect data to document the rise of incidences of hate crimes due to COVID-19; and (C) to hold the perpetrators of those crimes, incidents, or threats accountable and bring such perpetrators to justice; and (5) recommits United States leadership in building more inclusive, diverse, and tolerant societies-- (A) to prioritize language access and inclusivity in communication practices; and (B) to combat misinformation and discrimination that put Asian Americans at risk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The resolution shall be debatable for 1 hour, equally divided and controlled by the [[Page H4496]] chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary. The gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler) and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Jordan) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. General Leave Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H. Res. 908. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 908, a resolution condemning all forms of anti-Asian sentiment as related to COVID-19. Among other things, the resolution, introduced by my colleague from New York, Representative Grace Meng, calls upon all public officials to condemn and denounce anti-Asian sentiment, and it calls on Federal law enforcement officials to investigate and document all credible reports of hate crimes against Asian Americans, to collect data on the rise of hate crimes incidents due to COVID-19, and to hold perpetrators accountable. The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing crisis for our country. Over 6.6 million Americans have been infected, and almost 200,000 have died from COVID-19. It has upended the lives of almost every American in some way, and it will continue to do so for some time as we brace for a potential second wave of infections. On top of bearing the burdens that the pandemic has imposed on all Americans, Asian Americans have been forced to carry the added anxiety of confronting racial prejudice, including racially motivated harassment and violence stemming from the stigma that has unfairly associated them with COVID-19 because of the virus' origin in China, a stigma that has been reinforced by rhetoric suggesting such a link. According to the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, since March 19, there have been almost 2,600 cases of anti-Asian discrimination related to COVID-19. According to the resolution, at the pandemic's earliest stage in this country, between February 9 and March 7, there were over 400 such incidents. These include the stabbings of an Asian-American father and two young children, ages 2 and 6, in Texas. Public health entities, including the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have recognized that labeling a virus by geographic or ethnic terms unfairly stigmatizes certain communities and ultimately harms public health. For this reason, Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar rightly condemned the use of the phrase ``Chinese virus'' in testimony before the Ways and Means Committee, stating that: ``Ethnicity it is not what causes the novel coronavirus.'' It is incumbent on all public figures, including elected officials like us, to publicly condemn bigotry and the stigmatization of racial or ethnic groups unfairly targeted for blame. We must speak out clearly against such attitudes and acts of hate whenever they occur, but particularly in the face of public panic or fear during a national emergency, when society can be especially vulnerable to racist appeals and prejudices. While many public figures have admirably sought to end COVID-19- related animosity, some, unfortunately, appear not to share the same sense of moral duty. Rather than using their bully pulpits to confront prejudice and racial hatred, they have instead chosen repeatedly to use derogatory and prejudicial phrases and remarks, reinforcing the exclusion and stigmatization of Asian Americans in the face of a national crisis, a tactic that sadly has a long and ugly history in our country. Left unchecked, this type of rhetoric has, in the past, led to grave injustices like the Chinese Exclusion Act and the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. In the year 2020, condemning bigotry and racial scapegoating should not be hard for any Member of this House to do. It is long past time to leave the days of yellow peril hysteria and unjustified blame of the other behind. The House can take an important step in that direction by passing H.Res. 908 unanimously. I urge strong support for this resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, we oppose this legislation. Everyone knows racism is wrong, but that is not what this legislation is about. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins). Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam Speaker, let's be clear. There is no denying where the virus originated. It was China. There is no denying the Chinese Communist Party has done everything in its power to cover up their role in the ongoing pandemic, intentionally misleading the global community and forcing their friends in the World Health Organization to do their bidding. That being said, how is that Democrats are still refusing to acknowledge China's role in the coronavirus pandemic? Just recently, a Chinese virologist acknowledged that the coronavirus was released from a Chinese lab in Wuhan. Are we just to pretend that didn't exist or is not even a possibility? It seems like the route the Democrats would like us to take is to pretend that the Communists in China absolutely played no role in the global pandemic and blame it all on the President. To be clear, Madam Speaker, all forms of racism and discrimination are abhorrent, including anti-Asian sentiment. If that is what we were talking about today, that would be even better. But this is not what we are talking about today. The underlying tone, even from the chairman, is discussing how we deal with this in words. I have stood on this floor several times over the past year-and-a-half in denouncing all forms of hatred on both sides. But let's be honest. That is not what this bill is really about. This bill is exactly what this entire Congress has been about the entire time: Democrats ignoring the real issues plaguing Americans, just for the opportunity to criticize President Trump. Despite their overwhelming failure to undermine the Trump administration through the Russian collusion hoax and the sham impeachment, the Democratic playbook has not changed at all. Now, a little over 6 weeks from the election, Democrats are leaning on the global crisis to continue their admonitions, all at the expense of American families and businesses desperate for relief. Democrats have taken no issue in ignoring the coronavirus' effects on the ground in favor of criticizing the President, and no criticism is more dynamic than their collective offense at President Trump calling the virus the ``China virus'' or the ``Wuhan virus.'' Democrats would love for the American people to forget the work that the administration has done to tackle the virus, including shutting down travel for China in the early days of the virus. Instead of applauding the move, Democrats and Joe Biden accused the Trump administration and President Trump of fanning the flames of hate, fear, and xenophobia, when his actual actions kept others from getting it and kept it from spreading because it was coming from China. For the last 3 years, Democrats have repeatedly claimed that Russia must have something on Donald Trump. The real question is, frankly, during a presidential election, what does the Chinese Communist Party have on Joe Biden? Democrats would also love for the American people to forget that many viruses are named for where they originated. Take the Spanish flu, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Ebola, and German measles. Because the Democrats seem to be so bankrupt on this floor of bringing bills and real solutions forward, maybe the next 2 weeks we are up here, we are going to have one on the German measles and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. That is all we are doing, wasting the people's time with this right here. If you want to work on politics, go outside the Capitol, not here on the floor of this House. [[Page H4497]] President Trump and Republicans have made it clear where the blame of this virus begins. It begins and ends with the Chinese Communist Party and their refusal to acknowledge the problem they had and let it go into all the world. Refusing to acknowledge that fact is wrong, and failing to address it in the House, in favor of political messaging bills like this, is nothing more than political attempts to take down this President. Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline). Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, last March, as the COVID-19 pandemic first began to affect our day-to-day lives, the FBI warned that we could soon see a rise in hate crimes committed against Asian Americans. In this moment, President Trump could have tried to bring Americans together. That is not the path he chose. Instead, the President has poured gasoline on the fire, using terms like ``kung flu'' and ``China virus.'' The White House has stoked racial tensions and fed into our country's worst xenophobic impulses. From March until June of this year, our country saw more than 2,100 reported hate crimes targeting Asian Americans. More than 3 in 10 Asian Americans now say that they have been the subject of slurs or racist jokes since the start of this pandemic. These slurs and jokes aren't just words. They are actions designed to make Asian Americans feel less than equal, and they have no place in this country. But that is the reality of life in Donald Trump's America. This administration has tried to turn back the clock on racial equality. This administration has demeaned, belittled, and ostracized nearly every minority community. Today, the House is saying no more. We will not stand by as this administration attacks innocent men, women, and children of Asian descent. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this excellent resolution. {time} 0930 Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Posey). Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, I was hopeful that this resolution would lead us to common ground. None of us here believes in discriminating against our fellow Asian-American neighbors. On March 23, President Trump said the Asian-American community ought to be ``totally protected'' in light of the xenophobic attacks during the coronavirus pandemic. ``It is very important that we totally protect our Asian-American community in the United States and all around the world,'' President Trump tweeted. ``They're amazing people, and the spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way, shape, or form,'' he said. ``They're working closely with us to get rid of it,'' the President added. ``We will prevail together.'' I have restauranteurs in my district who suffered from bullies because of their heritage, so I asked my staff to prepare a resolution to echo the President's sentiments. My staff reported to me that such a resolution already existed, H. Res. 908, ostensibly to protect Asian Americans. On April 7, I signed onto what I considered to be a good faith effort to protect Asian Americans. I am more than saddened to see that this resolution and today's debate is being used for nothing more than to malign and vilify the President of the United States, just as the President and congressional Republicans have been called domestic enemies in the last couple of days. I would hope for more, but, sadly, this body has chosen to take the low road. This debate has devolved into finger-pointing, name-calling, and scoring political points. Rather than reaching a high watermark for bringing us all together, it has further ripped apart the fabric of America. I am deeply disappointed and will not be a party to today's partisan exercise that is more about scoring political points than rebuilding America. We should be working together to help all Americans recover, to investigate COVID-19, which has resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths around the world, trillions lost and trillions more spent responding to COVID. Lives and dreams have been shattered. We have a duty to all Americans to find a cure, to get to the bottom of just how this pandemic started, and to do what we can to prevent it from happening ever again in the future. Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Krishnamoorthi). Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker, today I rise in support of H. Res.908, condemning all forms of anti-Asian sentiment related to COVID-19. Since this pandemic began, there have been thousands and thousands of reports of discrimination and xenophobic attacks against Asian Americans in the United States, including in my district, which has one of the highest concentrations of Asian Americans in the country. As an Asian American myself, this is deeply personal and offensive to me. When people, including those in the White House, refer to COVID-19 as the Chinese virus or the kung-flu, they encourage bigotry or discrimination against Asian Americans. To put it simply, promoting anti-Asian-American sentiment or anti- Asian sentiment as related to COVID-19 is un-American, which is why I am proud to cosponsor this resolution and encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, again, we all know racism is wrong, but that is not what this is about. This is just another effort of the Democrats to attack the President. The third whereas in the resolution, the gentlemen just spoke about this. The third whereas in the resolution says you perpetuate anti- Asian bias if you use the terms ``Chinese virus'' or ``Wuhan virus.'' Well, someone should have told the media this. CNN called it the Wuhan virus. MSNBC called it the Chinese coronavirus. ABC and CBS called it China's coronavirus. CNBC called it the China coronavirus. So someone should have told the media that you couldn't use these terms. Frankly, someone should have told the Democrats a few months ago that a few months later the mob, the cancel culture, would say this is a term you can't use, because the Democrats used it on their committee notice. In the January 29, 2020, committee notice, House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation, Congressman Barrett, the chairman, says in the subject line of the hearing for the following week: ``Subject: The Wuhan coronavirus.'' Someone should have told the Democrats you can't use that term, but in the new woke world you can't state the truth. And as Mr. Collins pointed out: Did the virus start in China? Yes. Did the virus start in Wuhan, China? Yes. Did China lie to the United States about the severity and the origins of this virus? Yes. Did China lie to the world about the virus? Yes, they did. Did the World Health Organization lie to the United States? Yes, they did. Did the World Health Organization lie to the rest of the world? The answer to every single one of those questions is yes. But you can't say that, not in this world, not in the politically correct cancel culture. You can't state the truth. You can't state that the Chinese Government launched a disinformation campaign to cover up its role in exacerbating the spread of COVID-19. You can't say the coverup included punishing doctors, limiting the access of journalists, censoring the internet, spreading disinformation, and withholding information from the entire international community. You can't say that. You can't say a Chinese Government official publicly and falsely claimed that the United States Army brought it to Wuhan, the Chinese Government failed to institute a full-scale public response, and underreporting of COVID-19 cases and deaths propelled the virus on the course that it has been on. You can't say all that. You could a few months ago. You could have a few months ago, but you can't today. That is the cancel culture world. That is how the mob operates today. You used to be able to say, as Mr. Collins pointed out, the West Nile virus, the Zika virus, German measles, Spanish flu. Not today. Not today. They will attack you if you don't say it [[Page H4498]] the way they want you to say it, and this is dangerous. You can't say China virus today, and tomorrow who knows what it will be. But, like I said, a few months ago, even the Democrat committee chairman used the very term that is in their resolution they are saying you can't use today because somehow it is anti-Asian bias. I think it has more to do with the fact that we are 7 weeks before an election, and this is one more way to go after the President. But we should all remember, this is dangerous when you start saying certain things can't be said. If you don't say it the way we, the politically correct, the cancel culture mob wants you to say it, you have to be quiet. Silence is the biggest threat to the First Amendment, and that is what we are seeing. And they want to just say--this is broader, this is bigger. I would say look at the sports world. Look at the sports world. Drew Brees says you should stand for the national anthem; he gets attacked. Mike Gundy, football coach at Oklahoma State, goes fishing with his kids and wears what the mob says is the wrong T-shirt; he almost loses his job. He wore a T-shirt that had a conservative news outlet on the T-shirt. Oh, my goodness. You can't coach football if you wear the wrong T-shirt with your kids, according to the mob. You can't say a term today that just a few months ago they used on their committee notice. You can't say it today because that is what the mob says. James Harden says ``Back the Blue'' on a mask. He has to answer for that. Last week, two high school football players--on 9/11--ran on the field with a Back the Blue flag and a flag supporting our firefighters, and they get suspended because today the mob says that is not okay. We need to understand the cancel culture restricting, limiting, telling you what you can and can't say is so darn dangerous, and it will never stop, because the mob never--it never quits. You don't believe me? Two weeks ago--2 weeks ago--the mayor of this city, our Nation's Capital, has a proposal to remove and relocate the Washington Monument and the Jefferson Memorial. This is how ridiculous--this is how ridiculous it gets. And maybe I will just finish with this. Maybe the most ridiculous thing is the last clause, the last page of their resolution. The last page says: ``recommits United States leadership in building more inclusive, diverse, and tolerant societies . . . to combat misinformation. . . .'' Now, think about this for a second. If you state the truth, the virus started in China, you are a bad guy. You are not allowed to state the truth. This resolution says that is misinformation. The very misinformation that happened was China misinforming the world, lying to the world. You are not allowed to talk about that. You have to do what--this resolution says you have to do it the politically correct, the woke way, the cancel culture way, and that is why this is so darn wrong, so darn wrong. I hope we don't continue to travel down this road. This is scary where the left wants to take the country, so dangerous for the First Amendment and free speech rights. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Kim). Mr. KIM. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this resolution and in strong opposition to the rise of hate crimes and acts of racism toward Americans of Asian descent. We all know that these are divisive times. They are tough times. Hateful language, petty name-calling, and acts of violence are not the way for us to get through these tough times. This resolution allows Congress to come together to speak with one voice, that hate targeted at the Asian-American community has no place in this country and must be condemned. I am especially proud to speak here today with so many of my AAPI colleagues. Many of us have been the victims of these hateful and harmful actions. We have seen firsthand the vitriol of racism. We have felt the sting of the distrustful look or a harsh word. I hope you will join me today in acknowledging the impact of racism and forcefully renouncing it. I hope you will join me here today in calling on unity and calling out division. And I hope you will join me here today in passing a resolution that can remind us that even in the darkest times we are strongest when we reject hate and embrace America's diversity. Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs), the chairman of the Freedom Caucus. Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Madam Speaker, I join in condemning racial discrimination of all kinds. It should never be tolerated. I wish we had the perfect society and everybody recognized everybody in a colorblind way, but what this bill does today is it doesn't address that. When I heard the chairman of the Judiciary Committee just refer to calling the virus that originated in China the Wuhan prefecture, when I heard him say that this is somehow equivalent to the Chinese Immigration Exclusion Act or somehow equivalent to the Japanese internment camp experience that we had where over 100,000 Japanese were removed from their homes and taken to camps, I said: This really is the woke culture on steroids. This has gone beyond. If this would have been a condemnation of anti-Asian discrimination, I probably would have been right there signing this. I lived in northeast Asia for 2 years. I speak Japanese. I have traveled extensively in Asia. This doesn't address that. What it does is says: You know what, we want to do something when we are about 6 weeks out from an election. That is what this resolution is about. You can't tell the truth here. Let's just recite some of the things we know: The West Nile virus, that is because that virus emerged from the West Nile district of Uganda, 1930. The Saint Louis encephalitis virus broke out around St. Louis in 1933. The Japanese encephalitis virus broke out in Japan in 1870. {time} 0945 Coxsackie, New York State; Marburg, Germany; Hendra, Australia, all have viruses named after them. You will always have the ignorant who act out on racial animus. We condemn that. But let's tell the truth. The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome virus in 2012. We call that ``MERS.'' This week we learned from Chinese virologist Dr. Li-Meng Yan that not only did this virus originate in China, but it may have been manufactured and released intentionally by the Chinese Communist Party. So when the media refers to this as the ``Wuhan virus'' or the ``China virus,'' and other officials, including folks from this party over here, it is not because they have an existing racist sentiment, but it is rather to describe its origination as has been done historically. This resolution today is even more than a measure to appease the woke and tolerant and politically correct leftists. It is an attack on President Trump and all who support President Trump. It is a crying shame that you can't take the actual issue that you want to address and address it. You have to expand it that way for political purposes. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.'' Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee). Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and also for his tremendous leadership. And also, I acknowledge Representative Meng for spearheading this important resolution. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 908 to condemn all forms of anti-Asian hate speech related to COVID-19. Now, this pandemic is leading to an alarming rate of hateful speech directed at people of Asian and Pacific Islander descent in the United States. And the truth is, as an African American, I know what hate and racism is and I know the violence that results. And the facts are: Since March, there have been over 2,500 reported cases of anti-Asian discrimination related to COVID-19, including over 1,100 cases in my home State of California. At the same time, by no accident or coincidence, the White House continues to refer to COVID-19 as the [[Page H4499]] ``China virus'' and ``kung flu'' trying to shift attention and blame away from this administration's inadequate response and poor leadership. They would rather scapegoat Asian Americans, exacerbating anti-Asian hate and violence. Congress needs to send a clear message that we will stand with our AAPI community, especially during these challenging times, to fight bigotry and racism within our country. Hate speech does lead to violence and discrimination. That is the truth. Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. Takano). Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to condemn the xenophobic anti-Asian rhetoric that President Trump and his allies have been using to distract us from their woefully inadequate response to COVID-19. By referring to COVID-19 almost exclusively as the ``China virus,'' the President is fueling racism and inspiring violent attacks on Asian Americans and Asian immigrants. Rather than condemning this divisive language and unifying our Nation in response to the pandemic, my Republican colleagues are blindly following suit. This partisanship is so pervasive that Congresswoman Meng's simple resolution condemning this anti-Asian sentiment could not be passed unanimously out of this Chamber. This is a disgrace. A disgrace. The COVID-19 pandemic has become a defining moment in our Nation's history. Instead of unifying to confront this disease head-on, Republicans have instead weaponized this to revive the racist blemishes of the past. Madam Speaker, I urge passage of this resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Kelly of Illinois). Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Was it a disgrace a few months ago when the Democratic chairman called it the `` Wuhan coronavirus,'' or is it just a disgrace now when we are less than 7 weeks before an election and you guys want to continue to attack the President? Which is it? Because it can't be a disgrace just now when you used the exact same language that the Democrat chairman, the Democrat staff used for their subcommittee hearing. So you can get all fired up and start yelling at us, but the truth is you guys used it, the same terms you are now saying, oh, are so bad in this resolution. The hypocrisy from the left and the mob of what you can say today and can't say tomorrow is ridiculous, and the American people see it. They see it. They know this is complete BS. They know it is completely about the election, which is 7 weeks away. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Arrington). Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman, my dear friend from Ohio, for yielding. I am listening to my colleagues and the recent speaker. Where is that passion, where is that indignation over the violent mobs that are terrorizing our communities, that are assaulting our law enforcement officers? People are being killed in cold blood in once great American cities, and not nigh a word is said in this great Chamber about what is happening to our fellow Americans whose rights are being trampled. Instead, they want to hyperventilate over this pettiness. We know what it is about, and the American people know what it is about, Madam Speaker. They know good and well this is about scoring political points. They have seen it over and over, day in and day out for the last 2 years under the Pelosi leadership of this great representative body; obstruction, more political theater, and just dividing us. This is dividing our country. This is opportunism like I have never seen before. You can't refer to a virus by its place of origin? We have been doing that for time immemorial. And now we can't call it the ``Chinese virus,'' somehow that is offensive? This is about dividing our country. This is about stoking the flames of racial dissension. It is un-American. It is unacceptable for our leaders to do what is happening today. I trust the American people; they are watching this. This is the stark contrast in leadership that we have been talking about. Do you want more of this, America? Do you want more resolutions to condemn calling the virus the ``Wuhan virus?'' Or do you want to condemn what is happening in Portland, in Seattle, and the rise in crime and the mass exodus by our police officers, who feel that they have jeopardized their livelihoods and their lives? We have disrespected them. We have demonized them. What are we doing in this Chamber? God save the Union. God have mercy that we can't just come together, solve a few problems, I don't know, like the unprecedented crisis that we are facing to get our fellow American citizens and families back on their feet. To hold China accountable for what they have done. There are real problems to solve, and I want to work with my colleagues. And they know we condemn racism. They know we don't stand for making light of something so serious. But they are seizing on this political opportunistic moment. It is the wrong time. They are on the wrong side of history here, Madam Speaker. And the ultimate judge of what happens today in this Chamber and what has happened over the last 2 years will be in the hands of we the people. And that is my faith, that is my confidence. Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Case). Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, and back to the subject of the resolution on the floor, which is discrimination against any and all Americans on the basis of their race. As the proud Representative of the State and district with the highest percentage of Asian Americans in this country, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 908 to condemn any and all forms of anti- Asian discrimination during and beyond this terrible pandemic. Our country confronts not only the novel coronavirus but also a virus of racism and hate. We cannot allow the one to feed off the other. On behalf of all Americans, we have a moral responsibility to call out and condemn this wave of racist hate speech, harassment, discrimination, and physical violence driven by fear, disinformation, and even purposeful exploitation. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this resolution without reservation and speak out against racism against any group in any form at any time. Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Malinowski). Mr. MALINOWSKI. Madam Speaker, after 9/11, President Bush never once called terrorism a Muslim virus or an Arab virus or a Saudi virus. He made clear that the enemy was not the place where the terrorists came from or the people who lived there, but terrorism itself. He did that because it was right and because he knew that equating the evil of al- Qaida with an entire faith or nationality or country was exactly what our enemies wanted. So today, when prominent people in our country, whether they are Republicans or Democrats, or anybody in the media, encourage Americans to call COVID the ``China virus,'' language that seems to blame this pandemic on a country and a people, they are not only doing something wrong, something that has already encouraged violence and discrimination against Asian Americans, they are playing right into the hands of a Chinese Communist Party that wants Asian Americans to feel unwanted and unsafe in America. Now, if you want to blame this on the Chinese Government, sign me up. If you want to blame them or anybody else for lying to the American people, sign me up. But if you are going to give this virus a nationality, you are doing something wrong. And if you don't see the difference between those two things, then you don't understand what is going on in this country in this moment of division, this moment of danger that we face. Madam Speaker, I am proud to support this resolution condemning anti- [[Page H4500]] Asian rhetoric in any form. I ask my colleagues to vote for it, and I urge them to live up to it. Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. Cisneros). Mr. CISNEROS. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution condemning all forms of anti-Asian sentiment related to COVID-19. The AAPI community in the 39th District has been an integral part of fighting the coronavirus. They are first responders, essential workers, educators, and small business owners. Yet there have been too many stories in my district and across the country of racism, discrimination, and physical and verbal assault towards Asian Americans. I had the opportunity to hear some of these stories during one of my town halls, including the emotional encounter of a constituent from Brea, California. This young woman was unable to pick up her mother's prescription drugs due to racist aggressive remarks she received that were directed towards her. She left, running away in tears. This resolution will assure that cases like hers are justly investigated and receive the attention they deserve. I thank my colleague Representative Meng for her leadership, and I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this resolution to ensure protection, safety, and respect for our AAPI community. Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green). Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding the time. Madam Speaker, on this Constitution Day we will do well to heed the words of Dr. King when he reminded us that the ultimate measure of the person is not where the person stands in times of comfort and convenience, but where do you stand in times of challenge and controversy? Where do you stand when racism and anti-Semitism and anti-Asian sentiments are emanating from the highest office in the land? Where do you stand? {time} 1000 I stand with the business owner who is losing business, and some have gone out of business because of this kind of hateful violence emanating from words. I stand with the mother who has to console her child who comes home from school and who has been bullied. I stand with the child who has been bullied who comes home crying. I stand with the people of my congressional district and across this land who happen to be of Asian ancestry. I stand against racism. It is easy to say: ``I am against racism. I condemn racism.'' But when will you condemn the racist? When will you condemn the racist when it is emanating from the highest office in the land? This is Constitution Day. I close with these words from Emily Dickinson. The truest measure of the person, I have reminded you, but Dickinson reminded us that: ``A word is dead when it is said, some say. I say it just begins to live that day.'' These words live; they take on meanings; they impact people; and they cause harms. It is time for us to take a stand. Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, the import of this resolution could not be more clear. Anti-Asian sentiment will not be tolerated. Anti-Semitism will not be tolerated. Discrimination against anyone will not be tolerated. When language comes consistently from the White House, from other places that stoke anti-Asian sentiment, that stoke racism, this cannot be tolerated. And this House must declare that we will not tolerate it. This House must be on record against the use of language designed to stoke racism, against the use of language designed to pick out a particular ethnic group--in this case Asians, but it is the same as if it picked out a different ethnic group. No ethnic group should be the target of such obloquy, of such racism, of such opposition from the White House. None. It is unconscionable that we have to stand here and oppose the White House stoking anti-Asian sentiment. It is unconscionable that the White House would do such a thing. But if it does such a thing, then it is incumbent on this House to denounce it. It is incumbent on this House to make sure that the American people know that we do not stand with anyone, whether in the White House or anyplace else, who stokes deliberately anti-Asian sentiment. We cannot abide, we must not abide, the use of public office, the use of public facilities, the use of the public microphone to stoke anti- Asian sentiment, no more than we would tolerate it if it were stoking anti-Black sentiment or anti-Semitic sentiment. None of this is tolerable. We must not permit this. So, I say again, it cannot be allowed that, on the floor of this House, we do not denounce the use of public resources, the use of the White House, the use of public resources to stoke anti-Asian sentiment. Mr. JORDAN. Will the gentleman yield for a question? Mr. NADLER. I yield to the gentleman from Ohio for a question. Mr. JORDAN. Was The Washington Post on January 26, 2020, to use your words, stoking anti-Asian bias when they used the word ``Chinese coronavirus''? Was The New York Times on February 20, 2020, stoking anti-Asian bias when they used the term ``Wuhan coronavirus'' in their headline? Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, reclaiming my time. They learned their lesson. They stopped using such terms. They learned their lesson. They understood what this House should understand. They understood that the use of such terms stokes racism, stokes anti-Asian sentiment, and they stopped using the term because they learned the lesson. All we are saying is the White House should learn the same lesson, and they should stop using the term. And for that matter, Members of this House should stop using the term because it deliberately stokes anti-Asian sentiment. The Washington Post learned that lesson and ceased using such terms. The Washington Post learned the lesson. We are not saying that everyone knew this initially, but it is clear. It is now clear. The Washington Post learned its lesson and stopped using such terms. The New York Times learned its lesson when they realized that it was stoking anti-Asian sentiment and stopped using this term. We are saying that the White House and Members of this House and anyone else should learn the same lesson and not stoke anti-Asian sentiment by continuing the use of terms that we know stoke anti-Asian sentiment. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Bera). Mr. BERA. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 908, led by my colleague Representative Grace Meng. I do feel compelled, though, to respond to my colleague on the other side of the aisle, Mr. Jordan. I was that subcommittee chairman. We held the first coronavirus hearing in this new pandemic addressing the issues. Yes, we did identify it by its geographic origin as the Wuhan coronavirus. We also learned that as soon as we started to see instances of racism, violence against Asian Americans, that was a mistake. We stopped using that term. That is what we do as adults. We are not here to instigate racism. We are not here to instigate violence against any ethnic group. What we are here to do is actually defeat this pandemic. In that hearing, what we talked about is it is fine doing a travel ban from a country. That would buy us some time. But we also rightfully identified that that travel ban wasn't going to prevent the virus from coming to the United States. It wasn't going to protect us. We had to get ready. We squandered that time. [[Page H4501]] Look, this is a virus. It doesn't understand a country of origin. It doesn't know whether you are a Democrat or Republican, what religion or God you worship. It is a virus. It is shameful for Members of this body or anyone to continue to use language that potentially incites violence against any of our fellow citizens. That is what this resolution is about. Let's actually learn from that. I don't call it by its geographic origin. It now has a name. At that time, it didn't have a name. It is called SARS-CoV2 or COVID-19. We ought to call it by its name. We should not willfully or intentionally use language that potentially incites violence against any of our fellow citizens, that incites racism. We should be better than that. Let's show the American public that we can actually learn, and let's lead by example. That is what we should be doing in the House of Representatives. Again, we called it by its area of origin because the virus didn't have a name. We have learned from that. We don't do that. And we shouldn't intentionally use terminology that would incite violence against any ethnic group, religious group, or any of our fellow citizens. Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. Madam Speaker, what we should also do is denounce violence, all the violence, we see in our urban areas. The Democrats were given that opportunity just 2 months ago when the Attorney General of the United States asked them: Why won't you speak out against the violence in our cities? Why won't you speak out against what the mob is doing in our cities? Guess what we got from them? We got silence. Let's speak out against the violence we have seen for over 100 days in Portland and so many of our other great cities. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), the minority leader, the leader of our great Conference. Mr. McCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. The gentleman makes a very good point. Are we here condemning two sheriffs from California getting shot while sitting in their car? No. Are we here talking about the innocent lives that are being killed night after night in Chicago or other cities? No. Are we here, in the last hours before this body rushes to the airport to leave, to debate the help that we need for COVID, for those who are unemployed, or the small businesses that are going to continue to lay off somebody or are wondering whether they can survive the next day, or for the schools wondering if they will have the resources they need, or the States? No, we are not doing that. We are not doing any of that. But I will make this one promise to you: If the majority was on the other side, we would have already done that. Madam Speaker, Democrats are neglecting the real issues. Month after month, they have refused to end our dependence on China or even acknowledge that the Chinese Communist Party is a national security threat. I have read it in the paper. We have heard it out in the public domain that the Communist Chinese Party wants to influence the election even. They have picked a side. Now, in January, Democrats were too busy impeaching the President to pay attention to what was happening in Wuhan. There is a common denominator here. Let's just go through the calendar. In January, they were too busy with impeaching. In February, they backed out of what should have been a bipartisan China Task Force. They actually said yes. The Washington Post actually had the article written. The members were already chosen. But the hour came, and the Democrats thought that was wrong. Then, let's move to May. Speaker Pelosi said focusing on China is a diversion. I look forward to hearing what the Speaker says about this resolution. Is that a diversion from solving the COVID relief that we need? In June, Chairman Smith of the Committee on Armed Services on this very floor, just over at that mic, said this about China: It is not actually their job to tell the American people about the coronavirus. Seriously? Those were the words that were spoken by the chair of the Armed Services Committee. In July, Chairman Schiff--remember who he is and what role he has. He is the chairman of the Committee on Intelligence. He said it was an escalation for the Trump administration to close down the Chinese consulate that was, according to the Secretary of State, the hub of spying and IP theft in Houston. He was the only one who thought that. And now, today, while Democrats deny the real threat of Communist China, they are delaying a coronavirus relief package because they despise the President. I heard a Member here, Madam Speaker, who said we are adults, so we think differently. You know what adults do? They give adult supervision, and they focus on things that are important. We only have a few hours left before people leave. I know Madam Speaker told us before August that we will not leave unless we get a COVID relief package. I am not sure if I should believe her then or believe her now, because I know people are going to leave in a few short hours. I know, as the majority, you have the power to schedule what comes to the floor. That was one of my jobs. So this is what they picked? This is what we are doing? Seriously? My question to the Democrats is simple: Is debating a nonbinding resolution the best use of our hour? Apparently, you have made that decision. You thought long and hard long before we came to this moment in time. You spent hours on this. I will promise you this: There is no kitchen in America that thinks this is the priority. What makes today's resolution so harmful is it does not stop discrimination. It simply spreads disinformation. At the heart of this resolution is an absurd notion that referring to the virus as the Wuhan virus or the China virus is the same as contributing to violence against Asian Americans, which I will tell you nobody on this side of the aisle supports. In fact, we have heard time and again--I just heard from my colleague on the other side. The Democrat-led Foreign Affairs Committee held a hearing titled ``The Wuhan Coronavirus'' in February. {time} 1015 Should we put an ethics complaint? Are Democrats saying that their own committee members are encouraging discrimination against Asian Americans? Likewise, CNN, The Washington Post, NPR, The Guardian, all other major media outlets were referring to COVID-19 as the Wuhan coronavirus long before most Americans knew what it was. Now, let's put this in contrast, because you are wasting our time; you are spending hours on it. You think it is the most important thing, when someone is sitting there in the unemployment line or a small business is questioning whether they can stay open. So let's take this moment in time on this floor talking about it. Republicans condemn crime and discrimination in all forms. Listen to what the President said in March: ``spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way, shape, or form.'' But I guess you can't take his word for it, so let's waste another hour on this floor on a nonbinding resolution. Madam Speaker, I wonder--because every Member who comes here works hard to get here, I wonder the number of times Members in a debate said they would take their time to have nonbinding resolutions on the floor. I wonder the number of promises they made. Because I listened, Madam Speaker, to the Speaker up there when I handed her the gavel on what they said they would focus on. I have spent a lot of time trying to wonder what one problem this Democrat majority has solved. I have actually asked Democrats: Name me one that you solved. I haven't read a tweet from probably the most prominent of the new party's chief of staff. They had the same question. They couldn't answer it. [[Page H4502]] The President's words express what every good and decent American has known from the beginning: Asian Americans are not responsible for COVID-19. Let me be very clear. Let me state that again. The President's words express what every good and decent American has known from the beginning: Asian Americans are not responsible for COVID-19. Now, let me tell you everything else every American understands. We have an economic problem. We have people unemployed. We have small businesses questioning whether they can stay open. We have schools that are wondering could they have the money to be able to open again. But you chose an hour of this time on the last day before we leave to debate a nonbinding resolution. Congratulations. Well done. You fought hard for a majority, and this is what you decided. Unfortunately, while Democrats waste an hour of the House's time on this ridiculous resolution, the opportunity costs of the inaction are rising. And do you know who is paying the price? The American people. For months, every reasonable American has understood that America must end our dependency on China; we must move our supply chain out of China for critical needs like medicine. Do you realize we don't make penicillin? We don't make vitamins here, personal protective equipment that we strive so hard to get, and technology. The American people want safety and security. They want to return to the American way of life. I am not sure what this nonbinding resolution does, but I know we have done a lot of them since you have taken the majority. Unfortunately, the Chinese Communist Party is trying to hack our vaccine research at this very moment. That is why I introduced legislation earlier this summer to sanction these cybercriminals. My bill had real consequences. And you know what is so unique? I introduced the bill because there were reports out there that Russia, China, Iran wanted to hack our universities, our businesses to get that vaccine, not to work with us, but to steal it. Do you know what happens when they do that? It slows the process down. Do you know what happens when it slows the process down? It takes longer before people have a safe vaccine that would cure this virus. It is very interesting. That moment on the floor, the day after I introduced it, we actually--the FBI found two Chinese who were doing this, coming into our country, slowing the process down. We had the opportunity to have a motion to recommit on this floor. Nobody in America thought that bill would be partisan. It would only sanction those people who were caught, about right and wrong, about the safety, the security, a safe and effective vaccine being slowed down because of a foreign country coming in. So, as one, we had an opportunity to do something about it. Do you know what happened? The Democrats voted against it and defeated it. Not only did they defeat it, let me tell you, again, what the chairman of the Armed Services Committee said about it. He stood up at that microphone. He literally said it is not actually their job to tell the American people about the virus, referring to China, while they are hacking our own companies working to provide a safe and effective vaccine. You wouldn't spend 1 minute on that, but you are spending an hour on this. Sadly, this is not an isolated incident. Madam Speaker, the majority won't even work with the Republicans to protect our vaccine research from hackers, and they will attack the very companies that are working around the clock to provide that safe and effective vaccine for the American people. They won't work with Republicans to restore American manufacturing to rebuild the American medical supply right here, but they will call the House back into session to debate conspiracy theories about the post office. And while we were here in that emergency meeting--and, Madam Speaker, I should probably talk about it, because there were a lot of Democrats who didn't come even though it was an emergency meeting called by the Speaker. I think it was one-third of all of them did not come. But while we were here, that one moment, the one opportunity that the Republicans had, we offered a motion, a motion to recommit, to put up funding for COVID relief. Once again, the Democrats did the exact same thing. Instead of stopping the hackers from China, what they said no to, instead of giving another COVID relief bill that opportunity--because we were in an emergency, it was the only time we were coming back, even though, Madam Speaker, the Speaker said we would not leave--they voted it down. They voted it down, the only window that we had. They won't even work with Republicans on what was supposed to be a bipartisan China task force, but they wasted an hour on a nonbinding resolution. Is this how you expect to manage the Chamber? Is this why you took the majority, to waste the American people's time? Madam Speaker, it is time for us to stop acting like the House of resolutions and start acting like the House of Representatives. Make no mistake: China aims to displace America as the world's economic superpower. If they succeed, we will have more than viruses to worry about. The stakes are too high for petty partisanship. If we want safety, if we want independence, we know what we have to do. We have to rebuild our economy, bring back our supply chain, protect our vaccine research and, yes, end our dependency on China. Our President is doing that. House Republicans have made a commitment to America to do just that. We have done it time and again, bringing the idea to the floor. Unfortunately, the majority has thought otherwise. Madam Speaker, I make this promise to you: If the sides change, if we have the opportunity and the privilege to determine what comes to this floor, we will not waste America's time in a time of crisis. We will not tell people they will not leave and then let them go. We will not have Members call it an emergency meeting and let them stay home. We believe Congress is essential. We believe the American public expects that. Madam Speaker, we have a COVID crisis. We have an economy crisis. We have a dependency on China that harms us when it comes to our health issues. We have hackers from foreign nations trying to slow a safe and effective vaccine. We have schoolkids that continue to learn from home, not in school. We have veterans who want to be able to pick their own doctors. We have an infrastructure that is crumbling, but a 5-year plan to make a difference. These are all the problems that, if the majority would switch, would be addressed. But no, today, on our last day this week, we will once again have a nonbinding resolution. I hope you fought hard for this majority. I hope you spent a lot of time and a lot of hours deciding what would come to the floor. But if this is what it is, you have fallen well short of what America expects of this Chamber. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to address their remarks to the Chair. Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished Speaker of the House. Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the recognition, but I also thank Mr. Nadler, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for bringing this important statement of our American values to the floor of the House. I thank him and our colleagues from the Senate, Senators Kamala Harris, Tammy Duckworth, and Mazie Hirono, three Asian- American Members of the United States Senate who were so instrumental in advancing this important, as I said, statement of American values. And yes, it is a good use of time for us in the House of Representatives to state our values, to remove all doubt that people in our country are respected, and that we are not using a pandemic to have people--I will go into that in a moment. But let me just say this. Before the distinguished leader spoke, the gentleman on the other side said: Where are you when you are talking about violence, this or that? [[Page H4503]] We are there. We support peaceful demonstrations. We participate in them. They are part of the essence of our democracy. That does not include looting, starting fires, or rioting. They should be prosecuted. That is lawlessness. I am very proud that Joe Biden has presented the clarity of that, making a distinction that I don't think our colleagues quite understand but the American people do. In a poll released today, it said that the American people support congressional Democrats over President Trump in terms of dealing with the issue of crime in our country, for all of their misrepresentation. It is interesting to hear the revisionist history that the distinguished leader put on the floor of this House when he asked us what have we done. It is a very long list, and I will go into some of it. But I want to say to him, when you had the majority and the Presidency, the one thing that you did was pass a tax bill that put $2 trillion of debt onto our children and giving 83 percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent in our country. And yet you resent the fact that we want to invest more money in making it safe for our children to go back to school; more money into crushing the virus, which is what we do in the HEROES Act; and that we want to help our heroes. That is why it is called that. Our State and local employees, our State and local governments that provide services to the American people, our healthcare workers, our first responders, our police and fire, our transportation, our sanitation workers, our food providers, all of those people working make life go on for us; without them, we couldn't. And our teachers, our teachers, our teachers, the custodians of our children for a good part of their day and of their lives. {time} 1030 Yet the disdain that the Republicans have for our heroes is clear because that is the obstacle to our bringing the coronavirus legislation to the floor that is so needed. I hope that we can reach agreement on that. So when they talk about accomplishment, you had a President and you had two Houses of government. What did you do but take care of the top 1 percent to the tune of 83 percent of the bill that would put $2 trillion of debt to our children and their future? In terms of China, I have taken second place to no one in this body in my opposition to China for three decades. Sometimes I take pride in being called the most disliked American in China for my opposition to China; their trade policies which have been a rip-off of the American worker, and have fought them for decades, whether it is stealing our intellectual property, barriers to our products going into China and other violations; trying to stop their proliferation of weapons technologies of mass destruction to rogue countries, and delivery systems to make delivery possible of those weapons; to their human rights policies in Tibet and Hong Kong and now with the Uighurs and, again, all over China. So I have been on it every single day for over 30 years. I need no pontificating from the leader on the other side who seems to have newly arrived at this issue in order to deflect attention from the fact that the Russians are trying to, once again, infiltrate and jeopardize the security of our elections. Whoever interferes with our elections must be dealt with, whatever country it is; but all of a sudden it is all about China and not about Russia. I think the American people should decide who the next President of the United States is, not Vladimir Putin. So we come here today, and I say this about the legislation: We have had four bills that have been overwhelmingly bipartisan on COVID. Our first one on March 4 was testing, testing, testing; and still we do not have a commitment from this administration that we can crush the virus by testing, tracing, treatment, mask wearing, sanitation, ventilation, and separation--still. The solution is as plain as the nose on your face, which should be covered with a mask. Yet the President said he didn't want to cause panic, but he doesn't mind causing panic that will result in some terrible things happening to the Asian-American community in our country. He has brought about great angst as he shines a bright light on the injustices experienced by so many, including the surge of violence and discrimination being experienced by the Asian American/Pacific Islander community. So I thank the Asian Pacific American Caucus Chair, Judy Chu; the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chair, Joaquin Castro; and the Congressional Black Caucus Chair, Karen Bass, for their leadership on this important resolution and this very necessary use of our time to condemn and combat anti-Asian sentiment. Grace Meng has led this drumbeat for justice for a generation. Together with the other leaders she has brought this legislation to the floor, and I salute her. As the resolution states--and we have all seen--at the same time that the coronavirus pandemic has broken out, so too has a disturbing epidemic of hate and discrimination against the AAPI community erupted. You may not have noticed it. You may have tried to ignore it, but it, in fact, exists. According to the Stop AAPI Hate Reporting Center, more than 2,500 recorded incidents of anti-Asian hate have been perpetrated against the AAPI community since March. These include both physical and verbal attacks, commuters spat on, racial slurs lobbed at passersby, community members shunned, store owners having businesses vandalized, and even little children being pushed and shoved, and families insulted in places of business. Many of these incidents represent civil rights violations, and that is a value for us to protect. It is particularly unconscionable that more than 2 million members of the AAPI community are fighting on the front lines against the COVID-19 virus, yet instead of being celebrated as heroes, they are fighting violence and bigotry. In February, during one of my visits to San Francisco's Chinatown-- which I am overwhelmingly proud to represent--I was heartbroken to witness the devastating impact that fear, stigma, and misinformation are continuing to have on its families and businesses. Nearly half of recorded incidents of anti-Asian hate, according to the Stop AAPI Hate Reporting Center, have occurred in California. For many of the bay area who remember the systemic injustices and discrimination perpetrated against generations of Asian Americans, this resurgence is a traumatic reminder of the lingering specter of xenophobia. Sadly, this bigotry is being fueled by some in Washington, D.C --I thought there would be almost unanimous consent to condemn violence against Asian Americans--even from the White House itself, which uses dangerous, false, and offensive terms to describe the coronavirus. The World Health Organization and the CDC, the Centers for Disease Control, have explicitly warned against linking infectious diseases to a specific ethnicity because of the stigmatizing effects which have serious impact on health and defeating the virus. As the CDC chief medical officer said, stigma is the enemy of public health. Anti-AAPI bigotry violates our bedrock American values and undermines our fight against the coronavirus, and it must end. That is why we must do our part to combat hate, and that is why I am proud to support this resolution and am proud to bring it to the floor as an appropriate and excellent statement of values and good use of our time, instead of giving tax breaks to the wealthiest people in our country at the expense of our children and their future. It calls on public officials to condemn and denounce any and all anti-Asian sentiment in any form, and it recognizes that the health and safety of all Americans, no matter their background, must be of the utmost priority. We are none of us safe until all of us are safe. It condemns all manifestations of expressions of racism, xenophobia, discrimination, anti-Asian sentiment, scapegoating, and ethnic or religious intolerance. It calls on Federal law enforcement officials working with State and local officials to investigate and collect data on hate crimes and bring perpetrators to justice. It recommits our leaders to diversity and inclusion, including in our response to COVID-19. [[Page H4504]] This resolution has the support of hundreds of organizations, including from the medical and scientific communities. Now I know science doesn't mean much to you because you are anti- science, but the scientific community, the American College of Physicians, recently wrote a letter of support for this resolution, stating: It is an essential step to support the health and safety of our Nation during a national crisis. Hate crimes directed against individuals based on individuals' race, ethnic origin, ancestry, primary language, cultural background or nationality are a true public health threat. He goes on to say: It is imperative that physicians, and all people, speak out against hate and discrimination, especially during this national crisis caused by COVID-19. At this challenging time, our Nation's focus should be on respecting the dignity of everyone. That should always be the case. We cannot allow prejudice and discrimination to divide us. So let me just close by adding this: we had a tremendous opportunity, as I said, we passed four bills that were overwhelmingly bipartisan. The CARES Act has done some good things for our country. It also gave an enormous, practically $150 billion, tax break to the wealthiest in our country and made it retroactive. What did that have to do with the coronavirus, making a tax break for the wealthy retroactive? They can't pass a bill without doing something at the high end and then worrying when we want to help working class families in our country. Anyway, our counter to that bill was called the Take Responsibility Act. Those two bills came together. We were able to find our common ground, even though we had to swallow some bitter pills in order to help America's working families as well as small businesses in our country. Why does it have to be so hard? Because there is an anti-science attitude in this Congress and in this administration. There is an anti-governance; there is contempt of science; and there is disdain for State and local government which does so much for our country. Don't take it from me. The chairman of the Fed is saying that it recognizes that State and local government are an important part of our economy. Don't take it from me that we cannot open our economy unless we crush this virus. That is exactly what the Fed chairman said yesterday: it is essential to do this. But it takes money, it takes respect for science, and respect for the advice of scientific leaders in our country that has been absent. Instead, they play a blame game. Who pays the price? The Asian-American community in our country. That is why it is essential for us to follow Grace Meng's lead and that of the Hispanic, Asian-Pacific, and Black Caucus leadership today. I thank, again, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee for his leadership in bringing this important legislation to the floor. It is one of many. We have many bills that we have taken up and we will take up next week as we try to work together to find our common ground. One thing that we are working on right now is to keep government open, because while they may have an anti-governance attitude, we know that we have to make our compromises to keep government open. So, Madam Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to use my Speaker's 1 minute to salute the leadership and thank the sponsors of this legislation. You bring luster to the House of Representatives when you enable us to associate ourselves with the great values of our country and to respect the dignity and worth of everyone in our country. It has never been more important than in this time of great crisis in our country. The SPEAKER pro tempore. I want to remind all Members to address their remarks to the Chair. Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, the Speaker of the House said that the Russians are trying to jeopardize the security of our election. So are the Democrats. Democrats are trying to win the election after the election. Democrats in Pennsylvania have filed a lawsuit that says you can fix errors on absentee ballots after the ballot has been returned to the Board of Elections. I don't even know what this means. Can you vote in a race you didn't vote in? Can you change a vote? What does that mean, you can fix errors after you have already submitted the ballot? In Nevada, Democrats passed a law that says you can accept mail-in ballots 3 days after the election, even if the postmark date on the ballot on the envelope can't be distinguished. They are trying to win the election after the election. That is scary. The Speaker said that the White House is using dangerous and offensive language. The premise of the resolution in front of us is language can cause people to take action, and if you use the term ``China virus'' or ``Wuhan virus'', somehow that will lead to bias against Asian-American people; even though they used the terms ``China virus'' and ``Wuhan virus''. Everyone in the mainstream media used it. They used it in the committee hearing notice. Even though all that is there, they now say, oh, if you use those terms it will lead to anti-Asian bias. But they don't talk about the language they use and the left uses, the language the Speaker uses and how that may create an environment that will lead to violence. The Speaker of the House called the President of the United States an enemy of the state and said his supporters in Congress--Republicans--are enemies of the state. They don't talk about that. No. China virus can lead people to take action, but, no, not when the Speaker of the House calls the President of the United States and Republican Members of Congress enemies of the state. Two years ago a Democrat Member of Congress, the chair of a committee said this 2 years ago this summer: If you see somebody in the Trump Cabinet, you create a crowd, you push back on them, you tell them they are not welcome anymore anywhere. She encouraged her constituents to approach people in the Trump administration, harass them, and tell them they are not welcome anymore anywhere. She encouraged direct action. That is far different from using the term ``China virus'' which they used and which they had in a committee notice. {time} 1045 This individual Member of Congress said, ``Go harass people in the Trump Cabinet.'' The Speaker of the House calls Republicans ``enemies of the State.'' And that is all fine by them. But, oh, you say, ``the virus started in Wuhan, China,'' and somehow you are terrible. This is the crazy world the left is in today. The crazy world they are in today. And, again, as said earlier by the gentleman from Texas and by others, I think the American people see right through this baloney, see right through it. This is ridiculous. I hope we get our senses and start--as the Republican minority leader said--I hope we would actually start spending more of our time on issues of more value to the American people. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I thank our distinguished chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, and I thank and applaud the gentlewoman from New York for her outstanding leadership and championing the rights of all Americans. Madam Speaker, from the unwarranted, unwanted allegations of hysterectomies in immigrant women around the Nation in detention centers, to the President of the United States taking to the bully pit to be able to call COVID-19 and the coronavirus the ``China virus,'' we are finding ourselves in the midst of confusion that is hurting the American people--hurting them in two ways: One, over 6 million COVID-19 infections in the United States, and now, predictions of upwards of 250,000 dead. [[Page H4505]] Every one of them we, as Members of the United States Congress, should mourn because families, sadly, are having to bury family members having not seen them in their last days. What good is it to use that word--the ``Wuhan'' virus? That is not the scientific term. And out of that, we have created a hostile situation for our Asian-American friends, for Asian Americans who have been at the front lines fighting on behalf of this Nation. The use of anti-Asian terminology and rhetoric related to COVID-19, such as the Chinese virus, Wuhan virus, kung flu have perpetrated anti- Asian stigma and is reminiscent of dark and shameful chapters in America's past where Asian Americans were labeled as the ``yellow peril'' and interned in relocation camps. Madam Speaker, more than 23 million Asian American and Pacific Islanders account for 7 percent of the Nation's population in the United States, but over 2 million Asian American and Pacific Islanders are working on the front lines of this COVID-19 pandemic in healthcare, law enforcement, first responders, transportation, supermarkets, and other service industries. They feel threatened. For example, in March 2020, an Asian woman wearing a mask was kicked and punched at a New York City subway station by individuals; two children and two adults were stabbed at a wholesale grocery store. This was anti-Asian rhetoric. Finally, let me say, my own constituent, Coco Ma, in Houston, was afraid to go into a grocery store. Madam Speaker, include an article describing her concern. [From houstonchronical.com, Apr. 17, 2020] In Houston's New Normal, a Different Curve Emerges: Outward Racism Toward Asian Americans (By Olivia P. Tallet) Coco Ma knows it's risky to leave her house amid the coronavirus pandemic, as the number of Houston area confirmed cases increases and the peak is yet to come. The Rice University MBA student, however, doesn't even do the occasional run to the supermarket because, for her, the risk comes not only with battling against the virus but also against the vitriol aimed at Asian Americans like her, stereotyped as culprits of the pandemic. ``I have that fear . . . I ask my husband, who is white, to pick up the food we order. I'm afraid to go inside myself,'' said Ma, aware of the scapegoating impacting Chinese Americans and Asians in general who are mistaken as people from China, where the COVID-19 pandemic was first detected. Almost 1,500 hate incidents against Asian American and Pacific Islanders in the U.S have been reported to the STOP AAPI HATE initiative since it began tracking incidents March 19. ``We know that (that) number is only a drop in the bucket. We know that this is really ubiquitous now,'' said lawyer Manjusha Kulkarni, executive director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council and founder of the tracking hate initiative, headquartered in California. Although the tracking isn't well known around the country, it has already received reports of incidents in 46 states, including Texas, said Kulkarni. The majority of the attacks are verbal, but some are also physical. To report incidents Hate and racist incidents against Asian Americans related to the COVID-19 pandemic can be reported to: Hate is Contagious: racismiscontagious.com; Stop AAPI Hate: asianpacificpolicyandplanningcouncil.org/stop-aapi-hate. In West Texas, a man stabbed and cut members of a family from Burma, at a supermarket in Midland on March 14. The father and one of his two small children were severely wounded before a store employee subdued the attacker. The man allegedly said he did it because he thought the family was from China and infecting people with the virus. Local media outlets reported that the FBI is investigating the case as a hate crime. In Houston, a city known for its diversity and tolerance, a woman verbally attacked the owner of the Vietnamese restaurant Vietopia earlier this month in a parking lot in front of the business, screaming expletives and, ``You, get out of our country.'' ``I felt unwanted here. We were very offended,'' said Sammi Tran, co-owner and wife of the victim, who videotaped the incident. ``My husband was born here in America. We don't harm anybody, but this is happening now. I've never felt like this before.'' ``We go to the supermarket and they look at us as if we were ugly people,'' Tran said. `Racism Is Contagious' At over half a million people, Asians make up 8 percent of the population in the Houston metro area. Residents with Chinese heritage represent the third largest subgroup after Indian and Vietnamese. Roughly 70 percent of Asians in the city are U.S born or naturalized citizens, according to the U.S Census Bureau. Statewide, about 1.5 million residents identify as Asians, or 5.2 percent of the population. In Houston's Chinatown, the novel coronavirus hit businesses hard in January, well before residents were ordered to stay at home. Rumors spread on social media falsely claiming that an Asian supermarket in the area was shut down by the government due to coronavirus infections. Although there wasn't a single COVID-19 case in the state at the time, the rumors quickly propelled a fear of contagion and customers avoided the area, driving losses that reached 70 percent overnight for many Asian American businesses. Not long afterward, President Donald Trump called the agent of the pandemic ``the Chinese virus,'' stirring outrage and concern among Asian Americans. ``The community feels under siege. There is a genuine, palpable sense of fear in the Asian American community, they feel that they're being targeted,'' said Texas Representative Gene Wu, a Democrat from Houston. ``And this is not a Democratic or Republican issue. I've heard this from Democratic and Republican'' Asians. Trump recently said he was not going to use ``Chinese virus'' anymore, but some of his supporters do. ``China poisoned our people. President Trump has the courage to call it as it is: The Chinese Virus,'' the narrator's voice says over a sinister music clip in a campaign ad currently running on local television stations for Kathaleen Wall, who is in the GOP runoff for the 22nd District of Texas, representing the Sugar Land area. Asked if she didn't consider that her ad could negatively impact Asian Americans, she answered in an email: ``Leave it to Texas Democrats like Sri Preston Kulkarni to defend the Chinese Communist Party while ten thousand Americans have died because of the Coronavirus.'' Kulkarni is the Democratic candidate running in the November general election for District 22. Wea H. Lee, chairman of the Asian Southern News Group and the business organization International Trade Center in Houston, said attempts to diminish Asian people and their cultures overlook their success and integration in the country, such as having higher levels of income and education than the U.S population overall. ``These politicians, the people making this kind of statement, it's so stupid, they are so nave that they don't see really what our community looks like,' said Lee. The Anti Defamation League warns that online forums and posts, some from white supremacist groups, are ridiculing Chinese people in relation to COVID-19 and portraying them as a dirty culture. A national campaign called ``Racism Is Contagious'' is using data to raise awareness about the issue and collect reports of abuses. It shows photos of Asians wearing a mask with the message ``I am not a Virus,'' which has become a viral hashtag. Invisible stories For many Chinese Americans, the real story buried under the vitriolic noise is that their network of connections with China, Asian doctors and business people is precisely what has helped them help others during the coronavirus crisis. The North Houston Chinese American community, for example, acquired part of its donation of masks and medical supplies to local healthcare providers via their connections in China, said Yanbo Wang, one of the organizers. They raised over $14,000 in donations from 98 families and have helped seven nonprofit health providers and organizations. ``We paid for shipments to bring masks that people in China donated to us,'' said Wang. The shipment arrived right when those supplies were difficult to find. Similarly, The Pearland Chinese Association collected and donated masks and other products from many Asian Americans who bought them earlier in the year. Hearing from their families in China about the epidemic gave them an edge to prepare and acquire products before the pandemic was well known in America. Jie Wu, a board member of the association, said many Asian Americans who work in the Texas Medical Center also let them know early about concerns with medical supplies. She said they mobilized and raised thousands of dollars plus masks, gloves and protective gowns, in what the organization calls ``The Love for the Community Initiative.'' Masks were collected among school parents, many of whom worry that the stigma can hurt Asian American children born in the U.S Some reports nationwide have already pointed to hateful incidents against minors. Coco Ma, the co-founder of #SnacksForMedStaff initiative, is also concerned about the stereotyping. ``But I also want people to understand that I wanted to start the campaign not to prove who I am (and that) people should not get mad at me'' as an Asian person, said Ma. ``We Asians are doing this because we care.'' The idea of sending food to medical teams working in hospitals with COVID-19 cases came to Ma while talking on the phone with her mother, who is an administrator at a hospital in China dealing with the pandemic. Initially, she sent snacks to a few healthcare providers, but the initiative grew with people sending her money for a GoFundMe campaign. Ma, a Houston resident, and her classmate and program partner Kathleen Harcourt, [[Page H4506]] who is Asian American, have now created a website to make all the #SnacksForMedStaff activities transparent to donors. They have raised around $12,000 of a $20,000 goal and have sent food packages to hospital teams in Texas and other four states among the hardest hit by the pandemic. ``We are getting very good feedback from doctors,'' Ma said. ``They feel appreciated.'' As the coronavirus is soon expected to peak locally, adding pressure to medical teams, Ma said her initiative will raise the funding goal and provide more packages. ``People are so polarized,'' said Ma. ``Forget about politics, especially during this pandemic. Forget about race. Focus on what is the problem and coming up with a solution. This is about humanity first.'' Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I support this legislation because we have to stand to cure, to fix COVID-19, not to stigmatize and destroy the opportunity of saving America and doing the right thing by science. Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary and Homeland Security Committees, and the Budget Committee, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 908, which condemns anti-Asian sentiment in all its forms and manifestations, from whatever quarter, and from whomever, from the ordinary citizen up to and including the President of the United States. Since January 2020, there has been a dramatic increase in reports of hate crimes and incidents against those of Asian descent and the danger accelerates as the number of deaths attributable to COVID-19, which currently stands at 197,000, continues to increase and is expected to exceed 250,000 by Election Day on November 3, 2020. The use of anti- Asian terminology and rhetoric related to COVID-19, such as the ``Chinese Virus'', ``Wuhan Virus'', and ``Kung-flu'' have perpetuated anti-Asian stigma and is reminiscent of dark and shameful chapters in America's past where Asian-Americans were escaped as the ``yellow peril'' and interned in relocation camps. Madam Speaker, more than 23,000,000 Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders account for 7 percent of the Nation's population in the United States and over 2,000,000 Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are working on the frontlines of this COVID-19 pandemic in health care, law enforcement, first responders, transportation, supermarkets, and other service industries. Madam Speaker, there are approximately 2 million Asian American owned businesses that generate over $700 billion in annual revenue and employ nearly 4.5 million workers. According to a recent study, there were over 400 cases related to COVID-19 anti-Asian discrimination just between February 9, 2020, and March 7, 2020 with Asian Americans being harassed, assaulted, and scapegoated for the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, in March 2020, anti-Asian woman wearing a mask was kicked and punched at a New York City subway station; two children and two adults were stabbed at a wholesale grocery in Midland, Texas; a couple was assaulted and robbed by a group of attackers in Philadelphia; and a 16-year-old boy was sent to the hospital after being attacked by bullies in Los Angeles, California. According to a report in the Houston Chronicle, during this pandemic a different curve has emerged in the Harris County metroplex, one of outward racism toward Asian Americans, where the increased use of anti- Asian rhetoric has also resulted in Asian-American businesses being targeted for vandalism. Madam Speaker, the Secretary General of the United Nations called for international solidarity and an end to any ill-founded discrimination of the outbreak's victims. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) counsels against that naming COVID-19 by its geographic location or linking it to a specific ethnicity because such linkage perpetuates stigma. For this reason, in 2015, the WHO issued guidance calling on media outlets, scientists, and national authorities to avoid naming infectious diseases for locations. On February 27, 2020, the Secretary of Health and Human Services stated ``ethnicity is not what causes the novel coronavirus'' and that it is inappropriate and inaccurate to call COVID-19 the ``Chinese virus.'' On February 28, 2020, Dr. Mitch Wolfe, the Chief Medical Officer of the CDC said, ``Stigma is the enemy of public health'' and on March 10, 2020, Dr. Robert Redfield, the Director of the CDC, testified that use of the term ``Chinese coronavirus'' is wrong and inappropriate. So, I am proud to be an original cosponsor and to strongly support H.Res. 908 introduced by my friend, the gentlelady from New York, Congresswoman Meng. The resolution calls on all public officials to condemn and denounce any and all anti-Asian sentiment in any form and recognizes that the health and safety of all Americans, no matter their background, must be of utmost priority. The resolution condemns all manifestations of expressions of racism, xenophobia, discrimination, anti-Asian sentiment, scapegoating, and ethnic or religious intolerance and calls on Federal law enforcement officials, working with State and local officials to expeditiously investigate and document all credible reports of hate crimes and incidents and threats against the Asian- American community in the United States. The resolution also calls upon federal, state, and local authorities to so, collect data to document the rise of incidences of hate crimes due to COVID-19; and to take action whenever appropriate to hold the perpetrators of those crimes, incidents, or threats accountable and bring such perpetrators to justice. Finally, and importantly, H. Res.908 recommits United States leadership in building more inclusive, diverse, and tolerant communities and combatting misinformation and discrimination that put Asian Americans at risk. I urge all Members to join me in voting for H. Res. 908 and I thank Congresswoman Meng for introducing this important resolution. Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms. Spanberger). Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res.908. I rise today in support of my constituents of Asian descent. Central Virginia is the proud home to a strong and vibrant Asian- American community. And since COVID-19 began, we have seen a disturbing increase in hate crimes directed at the Asian-American community across the country, including in Virginia. Our neighbors, our fellow Americans, should never be the victims of discrimination, violence or derision. And today, I am proud to stand with them and support this resolution on the floor of the House. We should all actively and forcefully condemn these acts of hate directed at our friends and our neighbors, at home, across our communities. And today, I am proud to do so with my vote on the floor of the House. A vote that affirms the following: That we call on public officials to condemn and denounce anti-Asian sentiment; That we recognize that the health and safety of all Americans of any background should be our priority; That we condemn the manifestation and the expression of racism, xenophobia, and anti-Asian sentiment; That we call on Federal law enforcement officials working with State and local officials to expeditiously investigate hate crimes; and That we recommit the United States' leadership to build a more inclusive, tolerant society. Madam Speaker, to my colleagues who agree with these principles, I urge them to vote ``yes'' in support of this resolution and in support of our neighbors. I, for one, will proudly vote ``yes.'' Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the resolution for all the reasons we have articulated here this morning. I think it is important to go back and just remember, this is not about people of Asian- American descent. This is not about the Chinese people. It is about the Chinese Communist Party. It is about the Chinese Government, a government that lied to us about the origins of this virus, lied to the world, used the World Health Organization to continue to mislead the United States and the world. That has been where the criticism has been targeted by the President. But, again, 7 weeks before an election, Democrats don't care about the facts. They care about attacking the President, calling his supporters, as the Speaker of this House did, ``enemies of the state,'' bringing a resolution to the floor of this nature, but not being willing to condemn the violence and the mobs in the streets of our cities and certain places for over 100 days straight, looting and violence and rioting and attacks on our law enforcement officers. Nope, can't. We can't bring a resolution. We can't talk about that. When the Attorney General of the United States asked, the Democrat members of the Committee on the Judiciary won't even speak up then. Madam Speaker, I hope we defeat this resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Madam Speaker, this is an important resolution that will put the House firmly on record against the insidious [[Page H4507]] form of racism and racial scapegoating that we have seen since the COVID-19 pandemic began. It is completely unacceptable to use derogatory and prejudicial terms, like ``Chinese virus'' or ``Wuhan virus,'' as if they merely describe the factual reality of where the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 originated. First, this logic does nothing to justify the use of the term ``kung flu,'' another term often used by some to describe COVID-19, a term clearly designed to mock Asians and to associate them unfairly with this disease. Madam Speaker, the need for this legislation is clear. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, as millions across our nation continue to be impacted by the coronavirus, many continue to live in fear following the dramatic increase of threats and attacks against those of Asian descent since the COVID-19 outbreak. Since January 2020, there has been a significant number of reports of anti-Asian incidents; wherein, due to scapegoating Asian Americans for the spread of COVID-19, many are being threatened, harassed, or assaulted, or have had their businesses vandalized. The upsurge of racial discrimination against Asian Americans has been fueled by misinformation about the coronavirus and usage of anti-Asian rhetoric and terms like ``Chinese virus'' and ``Kung-flu.'' All of our nation's leaders must stop using these racist phrases that instigate hatred and violence. In the midst of the COVID-19 crisis, Asian Americans are left fighting an additional front--that of hate and bigotry. That is why I introduced a resolution condemning all forms of anti- Asian sentiment as related to COVID-19. We, as leaders of this nation, must coalesce and condemn all manifestations of expressions of racism, xenophobia, discrimination, and anti-Asian sentiment and scapegoating. We must denounce any and all anti-Asian sentiment of any form. Madam Speaker, during this time of heightened anxiety and fear surrounding COVID-19, we cannot lose sight of protecting the health and safety of every single person--no matter their race, ethnicity, religion, or background. The House must take a strong stand against the sickening intolerance, bigotry, and violence that is leaving a terrible stain on our nation's history, especially during this moment of an unprecedented public health crisis. The adoption of this resolution is a necessary step to confront the second pandemic of racism and discrimination in this country. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to keep all Americans safe. Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of HouseResolution 908--Condemning all forms of anti-Asian sentiment as related to COVID-19. I praise my distinguished colleague, Congresswoman Grace Meng, First Vice-Chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC), for her exemplary leadership on this Resolution on behalf of Asian-Americans and Asian and Pacific Islander communities all over the world. With this Resolution, I am reminded of the talented and brave Asians and Asian-Americans who have helped lead us through COVID-19. I think of my district's University of Toledo Medical Center's molecular specialist, Dr. Ji-Youn Yeo, Ph.D , a Postdoctoral Fellow of South Korean descent. Dr. Yeo's expertise helped the Center's coronavirus pathology lab modify its test to keep employees safe during the testing process. First Lady of Maryland, Yumi Hogan, was instrumental in obtaining 500,000 testing kits for Maryland by working with the South Korean Ambassador to the United States, Lee Soo Hyuk. The people of South Korea were able to minimize the devastation of COVID-19 on its own shores and became an example to the world by implementing lessons and procedures learned from its MERS outbreak. These efforts are a significant representation of how Asian communities are helping to combat the corona virus. To incite anti-Asian sentiments through racism, discrimination, or religious intolerance, especially related to COVID-19, is an insult to the very people who have helped shape our country. At this difficult time as we experience a resurgence of this troubling discrimination, I am reminded of my trailblazing colleagues as they continue the fight against discrimination, and through their efforts, are making our nation a fairer and more just society. One such trailblazer is the distinguished Chairwoman of CAPAC, Congresswoman Judy Chu, the first Chinese American woman elected to the United States Congress. She has served with great dignity and has been a fierce leader and advocate for Asian Americans. Former Congressman and CAPAC Chair Emeritus, Mike Honda, a statesman who was forced into a Japanese internment camp with his family in Colorado and then thrived to become a Member of the United States House of Representatives. He experienced xenophobia firsthand, and we heartfully thank him for teaching all those who face oppression that they have the ability to overcome and achieve remarkable things. I also recognize our distinguished Chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Congressman Mark Takano. He is a consummate educator and brave leader who became the first openly gay person of color to serve in Congress. These are some of America's finest patriots. I had the honor and privilege to serve with Congress' first female Member of color, Patsy Mink. A third generation Japanese American, she achieved greatness through insurmountable barriers. A fighter for the fundamental belief in equality, Mink co-authored Title IX to ensure that no person, regardless of sex, could be excluded from any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. She was ahead of her time and laid a great foundation for Asian Americans and women to follow. Congresswoman Meng's efforts today proudly honor her memory. To the current and past Asian American and Pacific Islander Members of Congress, the current 74 bicameral members of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, and the many Asian Americans who are working every day to make sure America stands tall during COVID-19, I salute them and their service to a grateful nation. I urge support for H. Res. 908. Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker. I rise today to support H. Res. 908, which condemns all forms of anti-Asian sentiment as related to COVID-19. Since the beginning of this pandemic, the Asian American community in Philadelphia and nationwide has seen an alarming surge in anti-Asian bigotry and in hate crimes. There is no doubt that COVID-19 has resulted in the spread of hate, racism, and xenophobia toward the Asian American community. As you may already know, the FBI warned at the end of March that they expected to see hate crime incidents against Asian Americans to increase suddenly as the general public associated the coronavirus with the Asian American population. At its peak, there were nearly 100 hate incidents being reported each day. Yet, the President and his Administration failed to address this and fueled this misconception with their rhetoric. Madam Speaker, words matter. This widespread racism against Asian Americans during this public health crisis is a serious and destructive issue that negatively impacts the lives of millions in our nation. Congress has a duty to address the ongoing anti-Asian sentiment and break the silence, raise awareness, and change the public perception surrounding it. In my hometown of Philadelphia, we have witnessed far too many hate crimes. Back in February, a young man and woman were physically assaulted by a group of juveniles at a SEPTA station in what appeared to be a racially motivated anti-Asian attack. In March, several Asian American homes were harassed through letters. Later in April, an Asian American-owned restaurant in my Congressional district was vandalized with spray-paint graffiti that included a racial slur. Just last month, an Asian American pregnant mother was attacked on the streets by someone who deliberately mentioned her race during the attack. The Asian American community has enriched the city of Philadelphia, and our nation, and we must do more to protect them. The prejudice against the Asian American community distracts us from finding real solutions to the pandemic at a time when they are much needed. Madam Speaker, now, more than ever, it is important to stand in solidarity with the Asian American community. We cannot let the rise in hateful rhetoric and discrimination go unchecked. We must work together to build a more inclusive and diverse society, and this resolution is a step toward achieving that. urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution to build on America's diversity, which has proven to be one of our greatest strengths. Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of HouseResolution 908, which condemns the anti-Asian rhetoric that has arisen because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Madam Speaker, our Asian friends, neighbors and family members have been unfairly targeted by bigotry in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using terms like the ``China Virus'' and ``Kung Flu'' is offensive to the communities I represent in the Lower East Side and Brooklyn. Our friends and neighbors in these communities are essential workers and small business owners who provided critical services to our community as the pandemic raged across New York City, and continue to play an essential role in our city's recovery from the virus. Unfortunately, New York City has seen a spike in bias crimes. We cannot let hate crimes go unpunished, let alone condone them. As the resolution states, there are over 2 million Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders [[Page H4508]] working on the frontline combatting against the pandemic. We must stand in solidarity with our friends and neighbors by denouncing the vitriol and anti-Asian sentiment. Our response to this pandemic should have been a unifying moment for our country. Instead, the administration has actively sought to inflame racial tensions. Today, we say ``no more'' to the anti-Asian rhetoric from the White House. I am proud to cosponsor this bill and I want to thank my colleague from New York Representative Grace Meng, for her leadership on this issue and urge all my colleagues to support its passage. Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution that condemns all forms of anti-Asian sentiment during this COVID-19 pandemic. This public health crisis has caused significant pain and suffering to communities across our nation, and we are especially concerned about an apparent increase in verbal and physical attacks, as well as discrimination, against Asian Americans. Our society must clearly state that this xenophobia must not and will not be accepted. Asian Americans are not responsible for the spread of COVID-19, and yet they have been repeatedly harassed, discriminated, and even attacked by some who wrongly believe they are at fault. There are over two thousand reported incidences of coronavirus-related discrimination by the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council. We must better protect our vulnerable communities during times of turmoil, and it is even more egregious that many of these same victims are simultaneously fighting this pandemic as doctors, nurses, and other frontline providers. Therefore, I am proud to support this resolution that explicitly calls on all public officials to condemn and denounce all anti-Asian sentiment in any form. Additionally, I am pleased that this legislation recognizes that the health and safety of all Americans, no matter their background, must be our utmost priority. On behalf of the constituents of the 30th Congressional District of Texas, I am proud to support this resolution condemning anti-Asian sentiment during this pandemic, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 1107, the previous question is ordered on the resolution and the preamble. The question is on the resolution. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3 of House Resolution965, the yeas and nays are ordered. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question are postponed."

The reckonings have been swift and dizzying.
On Monday, it was the dictionary, with Merriam-Webster saying it was revising its entry on racism to illustrate the ways in which it “can be systemic.”
On Tuesday, the University of Washington removed the coach of its dance team after the only two black members of the group were cut. The two women were invited to return.
On Wednesday, after a black racecar driver called on NASCAR to ban the Confederate battle flag from its events, the organization did just that.
On Thursday, Nike joined a wave of American companies that have made Juneteenth, which celebrates the end of slavery in America, an official paid holiday, “to better commemorate and celebrate Black history and culture.”
And on Friday, ABC Entertainment named the franchise’s first black man to star in “The Bachelor” in the show’s 18-year history, acceding to longstanding demands from fans.
In just under three weeks since the killing of George Floyd set off widespread protests, what started as a renewed demand for police reform has now roiled seemingly every sphere of American life, prompting institutions and individuals around the country to confront enduring forms of racial discrimination.
Many black Americans have been inundated with testaments and queries from white friends about fighting racism. And anti-racist activists have watched with some amazement as powerful white leaders and corporations acknowledge concepts like “structural racism’’ and pledge to make sweeping changes in personal and institutional behavior.
But those who have been in the trenches for decades fighting racism in America wonder how lasting the soul searching will be.
The flood of corporate statements denouncing racism “feels like a series of mea culpas written by the press folks and run by the top black folks” inside each organization, said Dream Hampton, a writer and filmmaker. “Show us a picture of your C-suite, who is on your board. Then we can have a conversation about diversity, equity and inclusion.”
“Stop sending positive vibes,’’ begged Chad Sanders, a writer, in a recent New York Times Op-Ed, directing his white friends to instead help protect black protesters, donate to black politicians and funds fighting racial injustice, and urge others to do the same.
The protests have so far yielded some tangible changes in policing itself. On Friday, New York banned the use of chokeholds by law enforcement and repealed a law that kept police disciplinary records secret.
But their power is also cultural. A run on books about racism has reordered best-seller lists, driving titles like “How to Be an Antiracist’’ and “White Fragility’’ to the top. And language about American racial dynamics that was once the purview of academia and activism appears to have gone mainstream.
In a video released June 5 apologizing for the N.F.L.’s previous failure to support players who protested police violence, Roger Goodell, the commissioner of the league, condemned the “systematic oppression” of black people, a term used to convey that racism is embedded in the policies of public and private institutions. The Denver Board of Education, in voting to end its contract with the city police department for school resource officers, cited a desire to avoid the “perpetuation of the school-to-prison pipeline,” a reference to how school policies can lay the groundwork for the incarceration of young black Americans.
“One of the exhilarating things about this moment is that black people are articulating to the world that this isn’t just an issue of the state literally killing us, it’s also about psychic death,’’ said Jeremy O. Harris, a playwright whose “Slave Play” addresses the failure of white liberals to admit their complicity in America’s ongoing racial inequities.
He added, “It’s exhilarating because for the first time, in a macro sense, people are saying names and showing up and showing receipts.’’
Sensing a rare, and perhaps fleeting, opportunity to be heard, many black Americans are sharing painful stories on social media about racism and mistreatment in the workplace, accounts that some said they were too scared to disclose before. They are using hashtags like #BlackInTheIvory or #WeSeeYouWAT, referring to bias in academia and “White American Theater.”
The feeling of a dam breaking has drawn analogies to the fall and winter of 2017, when sexual abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein triggered a deluge of disturbing accounts from women and provoked frank conversations in which friends, colleagues and neighbors confessed to one another: I’ve suffered in that manner as well. Or: I now realize I have wronged someone, and I’d like to do better.
Though racism is hardly a secret, “a huge awakening is just the awareness of people who don’t face the headwinds,” said Drew Dixon, a music producer, activist and subject of the documentary “On the Record,” about her decision to come forward with rape allegations against the music producer Russell Simmons, which he has denied. “Many people had no idea what women deal with every single day, and I think many non-black people had no idea what black people deal with every day.”
A shift in the making
While the outpouring may seem sudden, there have been signs that perceptions on race were already in flux.
Opinion polls over the last decade have shown a self-reported turn by Democrats toward a more sympathetic view of black Americans, with more attributing disparities in areas like income and education to discrimination rather than personal failure. By 2018, white liberals said they felt more positively about blacks, Latinos and Asians than they did about whites.
The reason for the shift is unclear — and those attitudes have so far not translated into desegregated schools or neighborhoods — but may help explain the cascade of responses to Mr. Floyd’s killing.
The outpouring is also related to the horrific nature of Mr. Floyd’s death — a white police officer kneeling on his neck for nearly nine minutes — captured in a stark video at a moment of rising national frustration with the government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the lockdown.
The protests still surging through the streets of America’s cities, said the civil rights movement scholar Aldon Morris, are “unprecedented in terms of the high levels of white participation in a movement targeting black oppression and grievances.”
Younger Americans are also much more racially diverse than earlier generations. They tend to have different views on race. And their imprint on society is only growing.
Brands trying to appeal to younger consumers have in recent years increasingly proclaimed their belief in equality and justice. Two years ago, Nike featured in a major ad campaign the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who knelt during the national anthem to protest racism. The tagline for MAC, the cosmetics company, is “All Ages, All Races, All Genders.”
In the wake of the Floyd protests, everyone from Wall Street C.E.O.s and the sportswear giant Adidas to the fruit snack Gushers and a company that sells stun guns put out statements of support of diversity, flooding Instagram with vague messages.
These prompted cries of hypocrisy from those who said the companies don’t practice the values they’re espousing.
At several companies, what employees saw as an inadequate response to Mr. Floyd’s death seemed to serve as a catalyst for a long-simmering contention over questions of racial equity. At Adidas, dozens of employees stopped working to attend daily protests outside the company’s North American headquarters in Portland, Ore.
The tumult has been especially fraught at Estée Lauder, the beauty giant, stemming from the political donations of Ronald S. Lauder, a 76-year-old board member and a son of the company’s founders. He has also been a prominent supporter of President Trump.
On May 29, employees at Estée Lauder, like those in much of the rest of corporate America, began receiving emails from the company’s leadership addressing racial discrimination.
There was “considerable pain” in black communities, one missive noted. According to copies of the internal communications obtained by The New York Times, the company, whose vast portfolio includes Clinique, MAC, Bobbi Brown, La Mer and Aveda, encouraged employees to pause working on June 2 in honor of “Blackout Tuesday.”
At a video meeting on June 4 among an internal group called NOBLE, or Network of Black Leaders and Executives, company leaders said Estée Lauder was donating $1 million to support racial and social justice organizations. But employees pinpointed Mr. Lauder’s political donations to Mr. Trump as being in conflict with the company’s stance on race. The president has tweeted conspiracy theories about injured protesters, described demonstrators as “THUGS,” and praised most law enforcement officers as “great people.”
Employees left dissatisfied. Later that night, a petition appeared on Change.org.
The company’s donation did “not match, or exceed Ronald Lauder’s personal donations in support of state-sanctioned violence,” organizers of the petition, which has amassed more than 6,000 signatures, wrote. “Ronald Lauder’s involvement with the Estée Lauder Companies is damaging to our corporate values, our relationship with the Black community, our relationship with this company’s Black employees, and this company’s legacy.”
In his first public comment on the situation, Mr. Lauder told The Times in a statement Friday that he had spent decades “fighting anti-Semitism, hate and bigotry in all its forms in New York and around the world as president of the World Jewish Congress.”
“As a country, we must recommit ourselves to the fight against anti-Semitism and racism,” he said. “In this urgent moment of change, I am expanding the scope of my anti-Semitism campaign to include causes for racial justice, especially in the Black community, as well as other forms of dangerous ethnic and religious intolerance around the world.”
On Monday, Estée Lauder said it would donate $5 million in coming weeks to “support racial and social justice and to continue to support greater access to education,” and donate an additional $5 million over the following two years.
Other companies have also pledged money. On Thursday alone, PayPal, Apple and YouTube collectively pledged $730 million to racial justice and equity efforts.
Jobs on the line
As companies face restive employees, pressure has also grown to remove those who have made offensive statements. Others have had to apologize publicly. Adam Rapoport resigned as editor in chief of the magazine Bon Appétit on Monday after a 2004 photo showing him in an offensive costume resurfaced on social media.
And Greg Glassman, the founder and chief executive of CrossFit, stepped down on Tuesday following comments about race and racism on a Zoom call to gym owners.
“We’re not mourning for George Floyd, I don’t think me or any of my staff are,” said Mr. Glassman on the Zoom call, according to a recording of the call provided to The Times.
“Can you tell me why I should mourn for him?” he said. “Other than it’s the ‘white’ thing to do. I get that pressure, but give me another reason.”
NBCUniversal, a division of Comcast that includes the NBC broadcast network and cable channels like Bravo, has encountered fires on multiple fronts as the reckoning has swept the country.
For NBC, the problems started the morning after Mr. Floyd’s death, when Jimmy Fallon found himself under attack on Twitter for performing in blackface on “Saturday Night Live” in 2000. A video of the sketch had resurfaced online. Mr. Fallon, who has been an NBC star for 22 years, first at “SNL” and more recently leading the “Tonight” show, issued a written apology that afternoon. He apologized at length on camera the following week.
On June 2, a writer was fired from an upcoming NBC series, “Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime,” after posting photos of himself on Facebook holding a weapon and threatening to “light up” looters.
Then came an explosion from NBCUniversal’s cable division. The hit reality series “Vanderpump Rules,” an anchor tenant on Bravo since 2013, fired four cast members for past racist behavior. Some of the incidents were already known. Others were disclosed on Instagram after Mr. Floyd’s death.
On June 8, Brian Roberts, Comcast’s chief executive, said in a memo to employees that the company would give $75 million to social justice organizations, along with $25 million worth of advertising inventory, including on Sky, its pay-television unit in Britain.
“We know that Comcast alone can’t remedy this complex issue,” Mr. Roberts wrote. “But you have my commitment that our company will try to play an integral role in driving lasting reform.”
A ‘boiling point’
Late last Saturday night, two women who study black health and communication were talking to each other, for what seemed like the thousandth time, about the racism they have encountered in their careers.
The killings of Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and too many others had brought them to a “boiling point,” recalled one of the women, Joy Melody Woods, a graduate student at Moody College of Communication. But the national conversation was still focused primarily on police brutality.
“That’s not the only system that perpetuates white supremacy,” Ms. Woods said. “There are other systems, and academia is one of those.”
Ms. Woods called on black scholars to begin sharing their experiences using the hashtag #BlackInTheIvory, which her friend Shardé M. Davis, an assistant professor at the University of Connecticut, had just coined.
The women went to sleep that night, not knowing they had opened the floodgates. The hashtag was trending by Sunday night, and as of Thursday evening had collected nearly 90,000 tweets.
The stories of exclusion, humiliation and hostility were all too familiar. But the difference was that they had mostly been shared behind closed doors. In the past, nonblack colleagues could be sympathetic but were more often dismissive or worse, sometimes labeling a black colleague as “difficult.”
“What feels different this time is that white folks are listening,” Dr. Davis said.
Particularly important, she and others said, is that white scholars seem to be having conversations about racism in their institutions without a black colleague around to prompt or guide them.
“You need to be willing to get in the mix and have the conversation and not expect us to hold your hand through the whole thing — and so maybe that’s something that is beginning to gain momentum,” said Chanda Prescod-Weinstein, a theoretical physicist and feminist scholar at the University of New Hampshire.
There’s a tendency among nonblack scholars to view their black colleagues as exempt from police brutality and violent hate crimes. But, Dr. Prescod-Weinstein said, “That sense of safety isn’t real — our Ph.D.s are not bulletproof.”
The danger is particularly acute for black naturalists, as shown in the recent incident with Christian Cooper, the birder in Central Park who asked a white woman to leash her dog, only to have her call 911.
“Our job means going into the field and being visible and moving in spaces that are not always welcoming to us,” said Earyn McGee, a herpetologist and birder at the University of Arizona. “We understood what the danger was.”
The viral video prompted Ms. McGee and others to organize #BlackBirdersWeek. Jeffrey Ward, a co-organizer and well-known birder, said he always keeps his binoculars visible to reassure people who act fearful when they see him. After two police officers followed and questioned him two years ago at Crotona Park in the Bronx, he recalled, he told some white friends. They were sympathetic then, but seem to better grasp the breadth and gravity of systemic racism now, he said.
“They reached out to me and said, ‘We didn’t understand it was this serious. We apologize for not listening to you before.’”
Dr. Prescod-Weinstein was one of several researchers who called for a strike on Wednesday to protest racism in science. Nearly 6,000 scientists, professional societies and institutions pledged to join. 
But she also noted that academic institutions are unrelentingly hierarchical and resistant to change.
As a postdoctoral fellow at M.I.T., Dr. Prescod-Weinstein was the only black physicist with a Ph.D. in a department of about 100. Students of color sought her out for advice and mentoring, she said — unpaid labor that she was never recognized or compensated for — and they felt the pressure of having to represent their entire race.
“That kind of pressure is extraordinary,” she said.
Inequity in universities manifests at multiple levels. Black academics are disproportionately hired to positions with weaker long-term prospects. They receive fewer grants, and their papers are cited less often.
Changing these systems will take “an incredible amount of energy at the right pressure points in the system,” said Dr. Kafui Dzirasa, a psychiatrist at Duke University.
For any system — say, applying for grants from the National Institutes of Health — making things more equitable would come at a cost, either to the system or to nonblack applicants. “And that’s the cost that it’s unclear if the system is ready to take on,” Dr. Dzirasa said.
Dr. Davis was more blunt.
“We’ve received nothing but empty platitudes and empty promises, and the wound just scabs right back up,” she said. “We’re walking around in institutions with a whole bunch of Band-Aids and scabbed-over wounds. Enough, enough.”

U.S. Representative Pramila Jayapal (WA-07) and nine city, county and state elected officials of color who represent the Seattle community sent a letter to Mayor Jenny Durkan and Police Chief Carmen Best today that urged them to enact meaningful and transformative changes to the very nature of policing throughout the city.
""We write as elected officials of color who represent various parts of the City of Seattle and are deeply committed to honoring the lives of the many Black brothers, sisters and siblings who have been killed by police violence and are currently experiencing the triple threats of a global pandemic, pervasive anti-Blackness and police violence,"" wrote Seattle's elected officials of color who serve at the local, county and state level. ""We believe this is the moment to enact meaningful and transformative change in the very nature of policing at the federal, state and local levels.""
The letter--led by Congresswoman Jayapal and Seattle City Council President Lorena Gonzalez--is also signed by State Senators Joe Nguyen, Rebecca Saldana and Bob Hasegawa, State Representative Cindy Ryu, King County Councilmember Girmay Zahilay and Seattle City Councilmembers Teresa Mosqueda, Tammy Morales and Kshama Sawant. It calls on Mayor Durkan and Chief Best to take three critical and timely actions:
First, immediately end law enforcement's violent response to ongoing demonstrations by ending the use of the National Guard; stopping the use of all forms of chemical substances for crowd control; ending the use of rubber bullets and flash-bangs; and demilitarizing police on the streets who interact with protestors.
Second, completely rethink policing to create a model for public safety that truly upholds the safety of all communities and redirect law enforcement spending and investing into essential services.
Third, immediately institute serious accountability and transparency measures into police contracts.
The letter comes just hours after Representative Jayapal helped to introduce the Justice in Policing Act, federal legislation that would implement long overdue police accountability and reform measures by establishing a federal police misconduct registry, making lynching a federal hate crime, ending qualified immunity, requiring reporting of all incidents of use of force to the Justice Department, banning chokeholds and no-knock warrants for drug cases, restricting the transfer of military equipment to local police and increasing accountability, oversight and transparency. The New York Times has described this new legislation as ""the most aggressive intervention into policing by Congress in recent memory.""
Representative Jayapal will discuss this legislation, today's letter and other key updates at a 6:00 p.m. PT constituent town hall on Wednesday, June 10. The town hall will be streamed live at Facebook.com/RepJayapal.
* * *
June 8, 2020
To: The Honorable Jenny A. Durkan, Mayor, City of Seattle, 600 4th Avenue, Seattle, WA 98104
Chief Carmen Best, Chief of Police, Seattle Police Department, 610 5th Avenue, Seattle, WA 98104
Dear Mayor Durkan and Chief Best:
We write as elected officials of color who represent various parts of the City of Seattle and are deeply committed to honoring the lives of the many Black brothers, sisters and siblings who have been killed by police violence and are currently experiencing the triple threats of a global pandemic, pervasive anti-Blackness and police violence. We believe this is the moment to enact meaningful and transformative change in the very nature of policing at the federal, state and local levels. We also believe that law enforcement's response to people exercising their First Amendment right to freedom of speech and demonstration must shift right now. Specifically, we call on you to:
1. Immediately end law enforcement's violent response to ongoing demonstrations, by ending the use of the National Guard; stopping the use of all forms of chemical substances for crowd control; ending the use of rubber bullets and flash-bangs; and demilitarizing police on the streets who interact with protestors.
2. Completely rethink policing to create a model for public safety that truly upholds the safety of all communities and re-direct law enforcement spending and investing into essential services.
3. Immediately institute serious accountability and transparency measures into police contracts.
We have watched in horror as the National Guard has been called into our city and law enforcement has responded aggressively to people protesting police violence inflicted upon Black people in Seattle and across the country. The methods used by law enforcement, such as deploying tear gas and pepper spray, are not only dangerous as these tactics could increase the spread of COVID-19/1, but they are also counter-productive. We are extremely disturbed that immediately after your declaring a 30-day halt to the use of tear gas by police, just last night we saw the use of tear gas by Seattle Police Department (SPD) officers. We are also appalled by video footage taken on May 31 showing an SPD officer using the same knee-on-neck tactic that killed George Floyd on a protestor, and reports that this same officer was seen kneeling on the necks of multiple people./2
In under a week, people have filed over 15,000 complaints against the SPD./3
It is not enough to commit to a ""proportional"" response to protestors. It is not ""proportional"" for the police to respond with rubber bullets or chemical agents when they are in full riot gear, many with rifles, while people in the streets have no protective equipment. The onus should always be on law enforcement to de-escalate, stand down and above all, protect the lives of the people they are sworn to protect and serve, including those that are protesting.
We see this moment as an opportunity to begin the modeling of a new and transformational relationship between law enforcement and community. The immediate fallback to the very same behavior that protestors are protesting--""domination"" with militarized police, large numbers of troops and dangerous crowd dispersing techniques--is not only wrong, it is likely to escalate the protests when what we need is a complete de-escalation and standing down of the police. Instead, we call on the City to immediately send back the National Guard, reduce the police presence and allow protestors who have been largely peaceful to continue their protests, and immediately stop the use of military crowd dispersing tactics including rubber bullets, pepper spray and flash-bangs.
Simultaneously, we believe it is critical to immediately commit to building a transformative new model of policing. We are a community that has led the country on everything from a $15 minimum wage to gun safety--now we must do the same in designing a model of public safety that protects everyone in our community, and does not have Black parents instructing their children at an early age to always avoid the police or worrying if they will come home if they have an interaction with the police. We believe it is time to do the same with a transformative new model of policing.
It is a horrifying reality that law enforcement in the South began as slave patrol and then moved to enforce Jim Crow laws./4
That culture of violence is deeply embedded in the very notion of law enforcement as it has been created. Today, across America, police disproportionately use force against Black people and Black people are more likely to be arrested and sentenced./5
That is why our re-imagining of community safety must begin with shifting police funding to community-based alternatives and investing in essential services like healthcare, mental health, domestic violence, homelessness and housing, and other basic needs. No amount of spending or changes to law enforcement can ever substitute for investment in these essential services; we need a public health response to public health problems. Budgets are moral documents. It is past time that we make significant investments in people and the systems they need to thrive.
We also ask that you immediately institute accountability and transparency measures, including through contract negotiations with the Seattle Police Officers Guild. We were heartened to see the call from the Martin Luther King County Labor Council to ensure that ""contracts do not evade legitimate accountability.""/6 We agree. This is past due.
This week, the House Judiciary Committee in Congress will have a hearing on a sweeping police accountability bill that the New York Times has described as ""the most aggressive intervention into policing by Congress in recent memory.""/7
It would make it easier for the federal government to successfully prosecute police misconduct cases, ban chokeholds, end racial and religious profiling and eliminate qualified immunity for law enforcement. It would also prevent the movement of dangerous officers from department to department, specify that lynching is a federal hate crime, and end no-knock warrants and the transfer of military weapons to local police departments. Finally, it would provide a new stream of federal funding to community-based organizations to reimagine how public safety could work in a truly equitable and just way to drive real policing reform from directly within communities. This is critical work being done at the Federal level. We must have similar transformative policies implemented at the state and local levels, and we must finally deliver on reforms that local advocates have championed for years, including changes to police contracts and implementing civilian oversight.
Thank you for your attention to these important matters.

CORRECTION APPENDED
What started as a renewed push for police reform has now touched seemingly every aspect of American life.
The reckonings have been swift and dizzying.
On Monday, it was the dictionary, with Merriam-Webster saying it was revising its entry on racism to illustrate the ways in which it ""can be systemic.""
On Tuesday, the University of Washington removed the coach of its dance team after the only two black members of the group were cut. The two women were invited to return.
On Wednesday, after a black racecar driver called on NASCAR to ban the Confederate battle flag from its events, the organization did just that.
On Thursday, Nike joined a wave of American companies that have made Juneteenth, which celebrates the end of slavery in America, an official paid holiday, ""to better commemorate and celebrate Black history and culture.""
And on Friday, ABC Entertainment named the franchise's first black man to star in ""The Bachelor"" in the show's 18-year history, acceding to longstanding demands from fans.
In just under three weeks since the killing of George Floyd set off widespread protests, what started as a renewed demand for police reform has now roiled seemingly every sphere of American life, prompting institutions and individuals around the country to confront enduring forms of racial discrimination.
Many black Americans have been inundated with testaments and queries from white friends about fighting racism. And anti-racist activists have watched with some amazement as powerful white leaders and corporations acknowledge concepts like ""structural racism'' and pledge to make sweeping changes in personal and institutional behavior.
But those who have been in the trenches for decades fighting racism in America wonder how lasting the soul searching will be.
The flood of corporate statements denouncing racism ""feels like a series of mea culpas written by the press folks and run by the top black folks"" inside each organization, said Dream Hampton, a writer and filmmaker. ""Show us a picture of your C-suite, who is on your board. Then we can have a conversation about diversity, equity and inclusion.""
""Stop sending positive vibes,'' begged Chad Sanders, a writer, in a recent New York Times Op-Ed, directing his white friends to instead help protect black protesters, donate to black politicians and funds fighting racial injustice, and urge others to do the same.
The protests have so far yielded some tangible changes in policing itself. On Friday, New York banned the use of chokeholds by law enforcement and repealed a law that kept police disciplinary records secret.
But their power is also cultural. A run on books about racism has reordered best-seller lists, driving titles like ""How to Be an Antiracist'' and ""White Fragility'' to the top. And language about American racial dynamics that was once the purview of academia and activism appears to have gone mainstream.
In a video released June 5 apologizing for the N.F.L.'s previous failure to support players who protested police violence, Roger Goodell, the commissioner of the league, condemned the ""systematic oppression"" of black people, a term used to convey that racism is embedded in the policies of public and private institutions. The Denver Board of Education, in voting to end its contract with the city police department for school resource officers, cited a desire to avoid the ""perpetuation of the school-to-prison pipeline,"" a reference to how school policies can lay the groundwork for the incarceration of young black Americans.
""One of the exhilarating things about this moment is that black people are articulating to the world that this isn't just an issue of the state literally killing us, it's also about psychic death,'' said Jeremy O. Harris, a playwright whose ""Slave Play"" addresses the failure of white liberals to admit their complicity in America's ongoing racial inequities.
He added, ""It's exhilarating because for the first time, in a macro sense, people are saying names and showing up and showing receipts.''
Sensing a rare, and perhaps fleeting, opportunity to be heard, many black Americans are sharing painful stories on social media about racism and mistreatment in the workplace, accounts that some said they were too scared to disclose before. They are using hashtags like #BlackInTheIvory or #WeSeeYouWAT, referring to bias in academia and ""White American Theater.""
The feeling of a dam breaking has drawn analogies to the fall and winter of 2017, when sexual abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein triggered a deluge of disturbing accounts from women and provoked frank conversations in which friends, colleagues and neighbors confessed to one another: I've suffered in that manner as well. Or: I now realize I have wronged someone, and I'd like to do better.
Though racism is hardly a secret, ""a huge awakening is just the awareness of people who don't face the headwinds,"" said Drew Dixon, a music producer, activist and subject of the documentary ""On the Record,"" about her decision to come forward with rape allegations against the music producer Russell Simmons, which he has denied. ""Many people had no idea what women deal with every single day, and I think many non-black people had no idea what black people deal with every day.""
A shift in the making
While the outpouring may seem sudden, there have been signs that perceptions on race were already in flux.
Opinion polls over the last decade have shown a self-reported turn by Democrats toward a more sympathetic view of black Americans, with more attributing disparities in areas like income and education to discrimination rather than personal failure. By 2018, white liberals said they felt more positively about blacks, Latinos and Asians than they did about whites.
The reason for the shift is unclear - and those attitudes have so far not translated into desegregated schools or neighborhoods - but may help explain the cascade of responses to Mr. Floyd's killing.
The outpouring is also related to the horrific nature of Mr. Floyd's death - a white police officer kneeling on his neck for nearly nine minutes - captured in a stark video at a moment of rising national frustration with the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the lockdown.
The protests still surging through the streets of America's cities, said the civil rights movement scholar Aldon Morris, are ""unprecedented in terms of the high levels of white participation in a movement targeting black oppression and grievances.""
Younger Americans are also much more racially diverse than earlier generations. They tend to have different views on race. And their imprint on society is only growing.
Brands trying to appeal to younger consumers have in recent years increasingly proclaimed their belief in equality and justice. Two years ago, Nike featured in a major ad campaign the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who knelt during the national anthem to protest racism. The tagline for MAC, the cosmetics company, is ""All Ages, All Races, All Genders.""
In the wake of the Floyd protests, everyone from Wall Street C.E.O.s and the sportswear giant Adidas to the fruit snack Gushers and a company that sells stun guns put out statements of support of diversity, flooding Instagram with vague messages.
These prompted cries of hypocrisy from those who said the companies don't practice the values they're espousing.
At several companies, what employees saw as an inadequate response to Mr. Floyd's death seemed to serve as a catalyst for a long-simmering contention over questions of racial equity. At Adidas, dozens of employees stopped working to attend daily protests outside the company's North American headquarters in Portland, Ore.
The tumult has been especially fraught at Estée Lauder, the beauty giant, stemming from the political donations of Ronald S. Lauder, a 76-year-old board member and a son of the company's founders. He has also been a prominent supporter of President Trump.
On May 29, employees at Estée Lauder, like those in much of the rest of corporate America, began receiving emails from the company's leadership addressing racial discrimination.
There was ""considerable pain"" in black communities, one missive noted. According to copies of the internal communications obtained by The New York Times, the company, whose vast portfolio includes Clinique, MAC, Bobbi Brown, La Mer and Aveda, encouraged employees to pause working on June 2 in honor of ""Blackout Tuesday.""
At a video meeting on June 4 among an internal group called NOBLE, or Network of Black Leaders and Executives, company leaders said Estée Lauder was donating $1 million to support racial and social justice organizations. But employees pinpointed Mr. Lauder's political donations to Mr. Trump as being in conflict with the company's stance on race. The president has tweeted conspiracy theories about injured protesters, described demonstrators as ""THUGS,"" and praised most law enforcement officers as ""great people.""
Employees left dissatisfied. Later that night, a petition appeared on Change.org.
The company's donation did ""not match, or exceed Ronald Lauder's personal donations in support of state-sanctioned violence,"" organizers of the petition, which has amassed more than 6,000 signatures, wrote. ""Ronald Lauder's involvement with the Estée Lauder Companies is damaging to our corporate values, our relationship with the Black community, our relationship with this company's Black employees, and this company's legacy.""
In his first public comment on the situation, Mr. Lauder told The Times in a statement Friday that he had spent decades ""fighting anti-Semitism, hate and bigotry in all its forms in New York and around the world as president of the World Jewish Congress.""
""As a country, we must recommit ourselves to the fight against anti-Semitism and racism,"" he said. ""In this urgent moment of change, I am expanding the scope of my anti-Semitism campaign to include causes for racial justice, especially in the Black community, as well as other forms of dangerous ethnic and religious intolerance around the world.""
On Monday, Estée Lauder said it would donate $5 million in coming weeks to ""support racial and social justice and to continue to support greater access to education,"" and donate an additional $5 million over the following two years.
Other companies have also pledged money. On Thursday alone, PayPal, Apple and YouTube collectively pledged $730 million to racial justice and equity efforts.
Jobs on the line
As companies face restive employees, pressure has also grown to remove those who have made offensive statements. Others have had to apologize publicly. Adam Rapoport resigned as editor in chief of the magazine Bon Appétit on Monday after a 2004 photo showing him in an offensive costume resurfaced on social media.
And Greg Glassman, the founder and chief executive of CrossFit, stepped down on Tuesday following comments about race and racism on a Zoom call to gym owners.
""We're not mourning for George Floyd, I don't think me or any of my staff are,"" said Mr. Glassman on the Zoom call, according to a recording of the call provided to The Times.
""Can you tell me why I should mourn for him?"" he said. ""Other than it's the 'white' thing to do. I get that pressure, but give me another reason.""
NBCUniversal, a division of Comcast that includes the NBC broadcast network and cable channels like Bravo, has encountered fires on multiple fronts as the reckoning has swept the country.
For NBC, the problems started the morning after Mr. Floyd's death, when Jimmy Fallon found himself under attack on Twitter for performing in blackface on ""Saturday Night Live"" in 2000. A video of the sketch had resurfaced online. Mr. Fallon, who has been an NBC star for 22 years, first at ""SNL"" and more recently leading the ""Tonight"" show, issued a written apology that afternoon. He apologized at length on camera the following day.
On June 2, a writer was fired from an upcoming NBC series, ""Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime,"" after posting photos of himself on Facebook holding a weapon and threatening to ""light up"" looters.
Then came an explosion from NBCUniversal's cable division. The hit reality series ""Vanderpump Rules,"" an anchor tenant on Bravo since 2013, fired four cast members for past racist behavior. Some of the incidents were already known. Others were disclosed on Instagram after Mr. Floyd's death.
On June 8, Brian Roberts, Comcast's chief executive, said in a memo to employees that the company would give $75 million to social justice organizations, along with $25 million worth of advertising inventory, including on Sky, its pay-television unit in Britain.
""We know that Comcast alone can't remedy this complex issue,"" Mr. Roberts wrote. ""But you have my commitment that our company will try to play an integral role in driving lasting reform.""
A 'boiling point'
Late last Saturday night, two women who study black health and communication were talking to each other, for what seemed like the thousandth time, about the racism they have encountered in their careers.
The killings of Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and too many others had brought them to a ""boiling point,"" recalled one of the women, Joy Melody Woods, a graduate student at Moody College of Communication. But the national conversation was still focused primarily on police brutality.
""That's not the only system that perpetuates white supremacy,"" Ms. Woods said. ""There are other systems, and academia is one of those.""
Ms. Woods called on black scholars to begin sharing their experiences using the hashtag #BlackInTheIvory, which her friend Shardé M. Davis, an assistant professor at the University of Connecticut, had just coined.
The women went to sleep that night, not knowing they had opened the floodgates. The hashtag was trending by Sunday night, and as of Thursday evening had collected nearly 90,000 tweets.
The stories of exclusion, humiliation and hostility were all too familiar. But the difference was that they had mostly been shared behind closed doors. In the past, nonblack colleagues could be sympathetic but were more often dismissive or worse, sometimes labeling a black colleague as ""difficult.""
""What feels different this time is that white folks are listening,"" Dr. Davis said.
Particularly important, she and others said, is that white scholars seem to be having conversations about racism in their institutions without a black colleague around to prompt or guide them.
""You need to be willing to get in the mix and have the conversation and not expect us to hold your hand through the whole thing - and so maybe that's something that is beginning to gain momentum,"" said Chanda Prescod-Weinstein, a theoretical physicist and feminist scholar at the University of New Hampshire.
There's a tendency among nonblack scholars to view their black colleagues as exempt from police brutality and violent hate crimes. But, Dr. Prescod-Weinstein said, ""That sense of safety isn't real - our Ph.D.s are not bulletproof.""
The danger is particularly acute for black naturalists, as shown in the recent incident with Christian Cooper, the birder in Central Park who asked a white woman to leash her dog, only to have her call 911.
""Our job means going into the field and being visible and moving in spaces that are not always welcoming to us,"" said Earyn McGee, a herpetologist and birder at the University of Arizona. ""We understood what the danger was.""
The viral video prompted Ms. McGee and others to organize #BlackBirdersWeek. Jeffrey Ward, a co-organizer and well-known birder, said he always keeps his binoculars visible to reassure people who act fearful when they see him. After two police officers followed and questioned him two years ago at Crotona Park in the Bronx, he recalled, he told some white friends. They were sympathetic then, but seem to better grasp the breadth and gravity of systemic racism now, he said.
""They reached out to me and said, 'We didn't understand it was this serious. We apologize for not listening to you before.'""
Dr. Prescod-Weinstein was one of several researchers who called for a strike on Wednesday to protest racism in science. Nearly 6,000 scientists, professional societies and institutions pledged to join. 
But she also noted that academic institutions are unrelentingly hierarchical and resistant to change.
As a postdoctoral fellow at M.I.T., Dr. Prescod-Weinstein was the only black physicist with a Ph.D. in a department of about 100. Students of color sought her out for advice and mentoring, she said - unpaid labor that she was never recognized or compensated for - and they felt the pressure of having to represent their entire race.
""That kind of pressure is extraordinary,"" she said.
Inequity in universities manifests at multiple levels. Black academics are disproportionately hired to positions with weaker long-term prospects. They receive fewer grants, and their papers are cited less often.
Changing these systems will take ""an incredible amount of energy at the right pressure points in the system,"" said Dr. Kafui Dzirasa, a psychiatrist at Duke University.
For any system - say, applying for grants from the National Institutes of Health - making things more equitable would come at a cost, either to the system or to nonblack applicants. ""And that's the cost that it's unclear if the system is ready to take on,"" Dr. Dzirasa said.
Dr. Davis was more blunt.
""We've received nothing but empty platitudes and empty promises, and the wound just scabs right back up,"" she said. ""We're walking around in institutions with a whole bunch of Band-Aids and scabbed-over wounds. Enough, enough.""

 Inequity in universities manifests at multiple levels. Black academics are disproportionately hired to positions with weaker long-term prospects. They receive fewer grants, and their papers are cited less often.
 Changing these systems will take ''an incredible amount of energy at the right pressure points in the system,'' said Dr. Kafui Dzirasa, a psychiatrist at Duke University.
 For any system -- say, applying for grants from the National Institutes of Health -- making things more equitable would come at a cost, either to the system or to nonblack applicants. ''And that's the cost that it's unclear if the system is ready to take on,'' Dr. Dzirasa said.
 Dr. Davis was more blunt.
 ''We've received nothing but empty platitudes and empty promises, and the wound just scabs right back up,'' she said. ''We're walking around in institutions with a whole bunch of Band-Aids and scabbed-over wounds. Enough, enough.''

Tuesday, August 4, 2020, p. 25
New York, nearly 50 men, women and children were killed or wounded in the deadliest anti-latino attack in recent U.S. history a year ago, an act of hatred considered terrorist by some nurtured by the xenophobic official rhetoric that has elevated racist violence in the country.
A year ago, Patrick Crusius, a 21-year-old white man armed with an Ak-47 rifle, drove about 10 hours from his home, near Dallas, to El Paso, for the explicit purpose, according to the message he allegedly drafted and uploaded the Internet, to curb the Hispanic invasion of Texas and when he was arrested to police that his target was to kill Mexicans. Upon arrival, he entered a Walmart, where in a few minutes he killed 22 people (one more died nine months later from injuries), and wounded 22. Nine of the dead were Mexican nationals.
Today Crusius faces 90 counts, 23 of them for hate crimes. The district prosecutor stated that this case could be considered an act of domestic terrorism.
Commemoration events were held throughout the day in El Paso, including the site of the massacre. In a nearby park, a healing garden, 23 silhouettes decorated with flowers were placed; in another 23 circles of candles were formed. Several organizations held tribute acts in that city, both to remember the lives lost and to demand justice not only around the accused, but in the face of anti-immigrant and xenophobic policies.
A year ago, our community and nation were dismayed and heartbroken by the horrific act of domestic terrorism nourished by racism and xenophobia that killed 23 beautiful souls, wounded 22 and devastated us all, said yesterday the federal DEPUTY Veronica Escobar, who represents that district. He stated that with the pain of this anniversary, the inhabitants of El Paso must continue to face hatred with love and confront xenophobia by treating the foreigner with dignity and hospitality. He pledged to continue the fight against gun violence and hate epidemics in the United States.
Other Latino and immigrant advocacy leaders accuse the official anti-migrant and racist discourse of nourishing the climate for what happened in El Paso a year ago, noting that although it was not an attempt with official blessing, to some extent the orders came from the president and his allies. ""There was a very powerful narrative coming from the president of the United States. a speech of racism, xenophobia and white supremacy,"" said Fernando Garcia, director of the Border Network for Human Rights, in an interview with USA Today. He concluded that August 3 was not circumstantial, but the result of the combination of easy access to arms, white supremacy, and President Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric.
When the representative visited El Paso a few days later, despite a chorus of local leaders who asked him not to arrive and others who refused to meet him, he refused to consider any measures to control the sale and use of firearms (the rifle and more than a thousand ammunitions used by the defendant were purchased online). Nor did he acknowledge any link between the facts and the xenophobic rhetoric of his government. Throughout the day he also decided to attack Democratic politicians in Texas.
But perhaps the image that caused the biggest controversy was a spread on Melania Trump's Twitter account during their visit to the hospital in El Paso (although it is notmet with none of the wounded there); in it is seen the first lady smiling with a baby in her arms; her husband, the president, by her side with a smile and making the thumb gesture up (that is, all right). The two-month-old baby, Paul, was an orphan, his parents were among those killed in the shooting.
Critics noted that the baby was moved from his home to serve as the stage for the Trumps. Doctors at the hospital told them that the tycoon told them how their rallies had been larger than those of the then candidate, originally from El Paso, Beto O'Rourke.
Meanwhile, no progress has been made in promoting new measures for gun control in private hands by the federal government, nor has the state of Texas with Gov. Greg Abbott, the president's loyal ally, whose election campaign included propaganda suggesting that Texans might have to defend border security with their bare hands the day before the massacre , remembers the Texas Tribune.
Trump, for his part, made no mention of the anniversary."

Chaudhry - popularly referred to by his supposed nom de guerre, Abu Huzayfah - had been the subject of numerous news stories since 2017. 
Most notably, in 2018, Chaudhry was the focus of Rukmini Callimachi's award-winning New York Times podcast, Caliphate. In it Chaudhry provided graphic details of his role within ISIS, the veracity of which is now being questioned. Chaudhry had previously been interrogated about his involvement with ISIS by Canadian national security agencies but was not charged. 
Nevertheless, Callimachi's misleading reporting at the Times prompted debates in Parliament, raising fears about an ""ISIS terrorist"" and ""despicable animal ... freely walking the streets of Toronto.""
The ensuing media attention fed into panic about the risk posed by returning ""foreign fighters,"" individuals - mainly Muslim women and men - who travelled to Iraq and Syria to support ISIS. 
In response to the Times podcast, the Canadian government reversed plans to repatriate Canadian foreign fighters and their families detained in Kurdish-controlled Syrian prison camps.
Callimachi's gaffe is a symptom
Chaudhry's case has raised questions about the abruptness of his arrest, the merit of a terrorism hoax charge, the substantial role of the media in the War on Terror and Canada's obligations to its citizens, including 26 children, held in Syrian prison camps. 
But the reporting and policy reaction to Chaudhry's alleged falsehoods reveals a sociopolitical climate where a different standard is applied to the threat posed by Muslims. Chaudhry's case is not an outlier, but rather a symptom of the system. Callimachi's faux pas is then just another story of Islamophobia.
Edward Said introduced the concept of Orientalism to capture how western societies imagine and produce reductive and racist representations of Muslims and Arabs. Our research on national security policies in Canada and the United Kingdom suggests that Islamophobia informs and legitimizes an Orientalist approach in the reporting of Muslim terrorism suspects and produces racialized national security policies.

Islamophobia is more than hate
Chaudhry's case reveals how Islamophobia operates beyond individualized instances of discrimination against Muslims. The view that Islamophobia is merely an ""irrational fear of Muslims,"" as a 2018 report by the House of Commons suggests, is simplistic and outdated. 
According to legal scholars Reem Bahdi and Azeezah Kanji, Islamophobia ""is historically rooted in Orientalism, draws on and perpetuates stereotypes about a Muslim propensity for violence, ... is state-driven and persists through a dialectical process of private and state action."" 
In our research, we outline how Muslims are racialized through the War on Terror: ""appearance as well as expressions attributed to Muslim bodies and Islam are framed within a social order which sees these as backward, foreign and threatening.""
Rather than abstract disdain for Islam or Muslims, Islamophobia manifests as ""concrete social action"" by the national security industry, populist politicians, journalists, experts, think tanks and others who benefit from portraying Muslims as ""inherently violent ... alien and inassimilable."" 
In this, any political movement connected to - or perceived as connected to - Islam is not only viewed as antithetical to democracy, but as a threat to democracy's very existence. This Islamophobia was especially evident in coverage by Callimachi, whose success skyrocketed after the Caliphate podcast.
Muslims and risk
Islamophobia is useful to understand how the dangerousness and riskiness of Muslims is constructed. 
First, Muslim beliefs and actions are thought to present the potential of regressiveness and violence. This establishes the basis of ""good Muslim, bad Muslim"": Muslims are considered ""good"" if they integrate and continuously perform their role as model citizens. But their potential of becoming a ""bad"" Muslim - who could radicalize toward terrorism - is never fully eradicated. 
Through this lens, despite interrogations by Canadian authorities and journalists, Chaudhry was presented as an ISIS terrorist before ever being charged.
Second, Islamophobia represents Muslims as ""dangerous internal foreigners,"" whose rights can be overlooked in the name of national security. This explains why Canadian Muslims in Syrian prisons are not even considered worthy of repatriation to stand trial. 
Finally, the Orientalist framing of the bad Muslim is the basis of counterterrorism practice - and perpetuated by academic scholarship - reinforcing the status of Muslims as a ""suspect community.""
The media in the War on Terror
Today, national governments, media conglomerates and security industries profit from the potential of catastrophe, and so perpetuate a present that is always ""at-risk."" 
News coverage plays a significant role in normalizing constant risk; counterterrorism and counter-extremism institutions rely on this to establish their legitimacy among the public.
The media's role in advancing Islamophobia cannot be understated. Media narratives that portray Muslims in dehumanizing and violent terms establish public consensus about the danger of Muslims. 
Incidences of terrorism by Muslim perpetrators receive more media attention and their motivations are linked to their ethnic and religious background. This feeds into a ""moral panic"" around Muslims, where media sensationalism and governments stigmatize Muslims as deviant and a threat to social and moral order. 
Chaudhry's case is not about an ignorant or irresponsible reporter telling a poorly fact-checked story. It is about the complicity of media and governments in vilifying Muslims to the point that it is reasonable to paint Muslims as terrorists before they ever stand trial. 
Chaudhry's alleged hoax - from its rise to an award-winning New York Times story to affecting Canadian national security policy - reveals a lot about Islamophobia today. This is the same Islamophobia that dehumanizes Canadian Muslims and casts them as potentially dangerous.

Ultimately, Islamophobia presents real harm to Muslims. It emboldens deadly anti-Muslim violence as seen in the 2017 Quebec City mosque shootings, the murder of Mohamed-Aslim Zafis and most recently the violent threats made against a Toronto mosque.

A petition has been started following the latest incident urging police to press charges against the woman.
This week the woman was seen launching a racist tirade against an Asian man, shouting ""This is from my government...go home...I don't understand you Chinaman"" in a mock Asian accent, among other comments, at a parking lot. The incident was captured in a video shared Thursday on Twitter by @brendonmcnerney, a friend of the man.
""Our friend and attorney just sent us this video of a very racist and extremely disturbed old lady going off on him while his kids are in the car,"" wrote @brendonmcnerney. The video has had at least 2.7 million views, as of Friday.
The woman approached the man as he filmed the encounter and said: ""You know what? I am not a racist person. But you know? You need to go home.""
The man can be heard replying: ""I am from [the U.S.],"" after which the woman said, ""Go home...do you know how many people can't stand you being here? You play games. We don't play games. I play games where you get [expletive] to death.""
The man filmed her car license plate and after she opened the door of her car, the woman said in a mock Asian accent: ""You understand me, Chinaman?""
When the man replied: ""Respect people, lady,"" she imitated him using the mock Asian accent saying: ""Respect. I don't understand your language, Chinaman. Respect? Then you move your car. You're way too close. Get away from me.""
""Do you know why my family is? Do you know who your family is? Go home to your family. This is from my government. Go home. You are getting [expletive]. You are so [expletive]. This is from my country and this is from my government. Go home. Put that on your Facebook,"" she continued.
""You know what? You are nothing,"" she later added.
The latest incident has seen others come forward on Twitter who reportedly had similar racist encounters with the woman in Torrance, including Kayceelyn Salminao, a Torrance resident.
Salminao said: ""I filed a police report on this same lady back in October 2019 due to a physical attack ON ME. Nothing came of it. What are you going to do about it NOW? @TorrancePD,"" in a post on her Twitter account sharing photos of what appeared to be the same woman.
Upon seeing the video of the woman ""I jumped and screamed and told my husband this is the lady that attacked me back in October,"" Salminao told CBS Los Angeles.
Salminao was at the Del Almo Fashion Center mall in October when she heard the woman berating and cursing at a janitor in the bathroom. Salminao told the woman to stop, after which she was physically attacked by the woman.
Salminao told CBS Los Angeles: ""She comes out and physically shoves me to the ground and I literally fall to the ground. She points at me and says 'You better not get up or else.'""
""As she grabs my hair, she pushes my head down and she's starting to me on the back of my head. She's saying all those really mean words, just like [in] the video,"" she said.
Salminao's husband then came into the bathroom and got the woman off of his wife. The pictures shared by Salminao on Twitter were taken of the woman just outside the bathroom following the encounter.
""I remember as she was walking down the hallway she said 'You guys are all gonna get it. You guys are all gonna [expletive] get it,'"" Salminao recalled.
Salminao never heard back from the police at the time she reported the incident to the TPD last year. The TPD has spoken to Salminao about her case this Thursday, CBS Los Angeles reports.
""I'm angry now. Where's the justice in this? She physically attacked me. She verbally attacked someone else. Who else has she done this to?"" Salminao said.
Another user on Twitter, @DarrelJDelfin, also recognized the woman in question and noted: ""OH WAIT A MOMENT. It didn't click until I saw your [Salminao's photos, but this woman had it out for me too! I think a year or two back? I was a guest at an anime convention in Torrance and this lady told me to go back to my country and all that junk!,"" on a post on Twitter.
The user added: ""I should clarify. This happened just before the convention started. I was out getting breakfast at a McDonald's. If this was at the convention itself, I would've shut that down and alerted staff. Needless to say, it was a great start to my morning.""
Members of the public have launched a petition on Change.org calling for the woman to be charged.
""The public demands charges against a woman who had been video taped and seen in public on three different occasions harassing people with racist slurs and inflicting fear in the community and United States. Name of abuser to be updated when confirmed,"" the petition said.
""We are asking the Torrance Police to charge this woman for disorderly conduct, harassment, and a hate crime. We ask charges to be executed for the maximum punishments. Including but not limited to:
""Disorderly conduct in California: We wish the following charges, 'Fighting, noise, and offensive words are all misdemeanors. Penalties include a fine of up to $1,000, up to six months in jail, or both.
""Hate crime in California: We wish the court to order the defendant to pay each victim $25,000 or more for violating the victims civil rights,"" noted the petition, which has been signed by nearly 3,000 people, as of Friday.
Members of the group South Bay Social, which is organizing a workout session Friday at the Torrance park where the ranting woman was spotted, said in a post on its Instagram account: ""We are joining forces to show support for our South Bay neighbor who was verbally harassed with racial comments while working out in Wilson Park.""
The group asked people to wear black, referencing the black attire worn by the Asian woman in the racist rant video.
Congressman Ted Lieu, who represents the Torrance region, noted: ""This woman went on an anti-Asian tirade in Torrance, CA [California]. You know what's sort of cool? The good and decent people of Torrance repeatedly elected an Asian American to City Council, then State Assembly, then State Senate, then Congress. That would be me,"" in a post on his official Twitter account.
Newsweek has contacted the TPD and the office of Torrance Mayor Patrick Furey for comment.
Last month, the New York City Commission on Human Rights announced it will belaunching an investigation on behalf of the city into Amy Cooper, a white woman who called the cops on a black man at Central Park when he asked her to put her dog on a leash.
The incident was recorded by the man, Christian Cooper, after he asked Amy to leash her dog in accordance with Central Park regulations. In the video, Amy can be heard saying: ""I'm going to tell them there's an African American man threatening my life.""
The latest incident comes amid ongoing protests worldwide following the killing of George Floyd, who died shortly after being pinned to the ground with a knee to his neck during an arrest made by the Minneapolis Police Department.

Zanele Muholi, though, wasn't crushed. Instead, the South African ""visual activist"", whose photographs are now on display at Tate Modern, met the omission eyeball to eyeball, and then set out to correct it.
Since 2003, Muholi, who is 48 and uses the pronoun ""they"", has worked hard to create a tangible history describing the lives of black lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer and intersex communities in South Africa, of which Muholi is part. They were greatly inspired by the no-holds-barred photography of Nan Goldin, who turned her lens on her drug-taking, drag-wearing friends in Eighties New York.
Faces and bodies haunt this show, acknowledging the troubled relationship that South Africa has historically had with the depiction of its people. (It was almost always the settler elite photographing a colonised subject.) That Muholi is not an outsider is therefore crucial, as is their insistence on the term ""participant"" rather than ""subject"", and that each photograph should be collaborative: the upshot of a sustained relationship or, at the very least, repeated meetings.
We see the outcome of that in the very first room: a trio of pictures titled ZaVa I, III and IV (2013) that show Muholi with ""collaborators"". Two were taken with Vaseline smeared on the lens, making the figures behind only partly visible, at the centre of a beautiful foggy swirl. The third features two women wrapped jointly in a crisp, Madonna-like cowl, and is photographed so attentively that one notices gooseflesh prickling in an unseen breeze.
It's not all so comely. A few feet away, pictures display evidence of the hate crimes that are a brutal reality for queer South Africans. Freedom of sexual orientation may be guaranteed under the rainbow nation's progressive constitution, but homophobic attacks, murders and ""corrective"" rape remain commonplace. It's hard to say what is more awful: the six-inch scar, or the indifferent, half-baked biro jottings of a Soweto policeman for his ""report"" of a serious assault.
What makes one picture more alluring or memorable than another is often down to something nobody sees but you. Even so, I defy anyone not to be stirred by Muholi's portrait series
Faces and Phases (2006-ongoing) which, at several hundred pictures strong, near covers one of the Blavatnik's most cavernous rooms.
Potent subject matter aside (and the laying down of a visual library of queerness for future generations feels currently very potent) Faces and Phases establishes beyond doubt that
Muholi is an extraordinarily good photographer. Depth, tonal range - it is all masterfully done. To look into each pair of eyes is to feel as if your own head has been temporarily turned transparent; the reel of your thoughts exposed for all to see.
The same is true for Somnyama Ngonyama (2012-ongoing), though here the faces are all Muholi in dozens of guises and roles. Some of these selfportraits - one sold for $35,000 (£26,000) a few weeks ago - plunder early South African photography for ""native"" props such as beads and animal skins. Others make use of the symbolic value of everyday objects such as scouring pads and combs to refer to the black labour force or the tests employed during the apartheid era to determine ethnic origin.
There is a riveting urgency and, dare one say it, an excitement, because Muholi is breaking ground like no other. I left with a head crammed full of images and stories, every last one both new and thrillingly real.

But I was blindsided by my daughter’s coming out as trans, and that first year was riddled with mistakes.
Sweat trickled down my neck as I stood in the heat alongside my daughter and husband, waiting for our turn to march in the Los Angeles Pride Parade in 2018.
While I had been a spectator at Pride before, I never guessed that one day I would be marching beside my teenager, dark maroon lipstick painting her lips, a barrette pinning back her now almost shoulder-length hair, a “she” pin fastened to her “love wins” shirt. She was beaming and radiant.
I looked over at my husband and held his gaze. We each ceremoniously waved the pink, blue and white striped trans-pride flag with one hand and gripped our daughter’s hand with the other.
I had spent more than 15 years examining hundreds of newborn babies wrapped in pink, blue and white striped blankets when I made my hospital rounds as a pediatrician. But I had only recently learned that the trans-pride flag had a similar pattern. This wasn’t the only thing I had learned over the last year. Being a pediatrician and mother of three, I didn’t think there were many parenting scenarios that could catch me unprepared. But I had been blindsided by my daughter’s coming out as trans, and that first year was riddled with mistakes. Following are three of the greatest lessons I learned, which ultimately made me a better mother.
Be an optimist for your child.
Once our daughter came out, the language in our home became predominantly negative. Are you sure? Your life is going to be so much harder and you’ll be discriminated against. You are so smart with so much potential, but some people won’t see that. You’ll have a more difficult time getting a job. You’ll have to work harder to prove your worth. You could be the victim of a hate crime.
Even if my husband and I weren’t always making these statements directly to our daughter, fear and worry pervaded all of our conversations, creating an overall negative energy in our home. One day we found our daughter moping around on the couch, dismayed about her future, and realized it was all our fault.
We decided right then and there to stop being pessimists. We told her that with her big heart, intelligence and family support, there were no limits on what she could accomplish. We shifted our focus from all the negative trans media coverage and began highlighting the positive, citing examples of trans people living full lives and making a difference in the world. We said that we expect all three of our children to pursue their passions wholeheartedly, and that she was no exception. The more positively we spoke, the more optimistic I became.
Your child is dealing with enough negativity from the media and outside world. Make your home a safe space. Don’t be a pessimist. Instead of telling your child they have a long and limited road ahead, tell them their future is bright with no limits on what they can accomplish or who they can be.
There is not one way to be trans or transition.
As a pediatrician, I assumed I knew all about trans identity and its presentation, despite never receiving any formal training on gender identity or transgender health care. I questioned my daughter’s trans identity because she didn’t have signs in childhood. I’ve learned that not every trans person presents at the same age or in the same way. Trans identity can emerge during childhood, adolescence or beyond. Just because the way your child presents doesn’t align with your understanding doesn’t mean their trans identity is not valid.
Once I accepted my child’s gender identity, I had my own ideas of what transition meant. I stepped in and orchestrated various appointments for my daughter according to how I thought her transition should be. While my daughter was eager to begin medical transition, the pace of all the appointments involved was overwhelming at times. Transition can involve social, medical and surgical options, or a combination thereof. Not every trans person chooses every intervention available.
I’ve spent a lifetime expressing my gender in different ways, like choosing a pantsuit some days and a frilly dress on others. Most days I wear makeup, but some days I don’t. Gender identity is not a choice, but how we express our gender is. Don’t impose your choices on your child or make assumptions that they will want to explore procedures to help them look or sound more like they are cisgender. The American Academy of Pediatrics’ first policy statement on the comprehensive care of transgender and gender diverse kids outlines a multidisciplinary approach, emphasizing “there is no prescribed path, sequence or endpoint.” Ask them what they want, listen and go at their pace while providing support and being an advocate. Leave the doors of communication open.
Make decisions based on love, not fear.
Fear had my husband and I paralyzed with indecision and inaction for months before I reached out to another mother who had also been blindsided by her child coming out as a teenager. I heard her speak at a Moth storytelling event, and was moved and inspired by her journey from bewilderment to acceptance.
She gave me an invaluable lesson that every parent can practice, whether or not they have a trans child. She told me that at every decision point, she would ask herself if she was deciding based on fear or love. If you’re asking yourself, “Should I let my child take the next step toward transition?”, the fear choice and answer would be, “What if she regrets it or changes her mind?” The love choice and answer would be, “Is this the right decision for the child in front of me now? What does my child need from me today?”
Multiple studies have shown that supporting transgender teens in their identity significantly improves their mental health and decreases their threefold risk of suicide to the same rate as that of their cisgenderpeers.
When your children are newborns, you meet their cries minute to minute. Let that parental instinct take over again. Initially, concern over how reactions of elderly relatives and friends would impact my parents also held me back. While my parents are progressive, I worried that gender variance would be beyond their level of understanding given their age and the conservative culture they grew up in. Then I realized that I had an obligation to do what is best for my child over an obligation to protect anyone else.
As a pediatrician, I’ve always supported parents in making decisions for their kids based on their own beliefs rather than those of extended family or friends. Pretend that there is no fear or hate in the world, and ask yourself what decision you would make. Then do that. Sometimes, it really can be that simple.
Are you the one raising your child, or is the outside world? Choose love as your guiding point. Choose your child.
Having a transgender child has expanded my heart and mind in unimaginable ways. It has brought people into my life that I would not have otherwise met and enriched my understanding of what it means to be human. Most importantly, it has taught me the true definition of unconditional love and what it means to be a mother.

To look into each pair of eyes is to feel as if your own head has been temporarily turned transparent; the reel of your thoughts exposed for all to see. 
The same is true for Somnyama Ngonyama (2012-ongoing), though here the faces are all Muholi in dozens of guises and roles. Some of these self portraits (one sold for $35,000 dollars a few weeks ago) plunder early South African photography for “native” props such as beads and animal skins. Others make use of the symbolic value of everyday objects such as scouring pads and combs to refer to the Black labour force or the tests employed by officials during the apartheid era to determine ethnic origin.
There is a riveting urgency to this exhibition and, dare one say it, an excitement, because Muholi is breaking ground like no other. I left with a head crammed full of images and stories, and every last one both new and thrillingly real.

Today I lost a close friend. Cherished and admired by my family. 
A great humanitarian. Generous and kind individual. I have a heavy heart for it was so sudden. No, she did not die! Then why such great sadness? She cut off our friendship because I am a Conservative and she is a Liberal. Believe me, just as painful.On June 9, 2020, American Thinker published an article I wrote called, 'Whiteness,' The New Evil. It has brought many incredible people into my life. Since my Liberal friend and I shared many life events, Isent the article[2]to her.I didn't speak with my Liberal friend for two weeks and when I called to 'check in' and see how she and her family were doing, the last part of our conversation was about my article. Prior to this, we never talked politics. I said, 'I guess you now know I am a Conservative and I think you are Liberal.' She acknowledged, 'A little Liberal and some of my family are a little Conservative.' (That is like being a little bit pregnant.) She said she liked the part I wrote about antisemitism and the Ethiopian Jews, but she didn't agree with other points I made. One being that I believe that antisemitism is more prevalent in the United States than racism. She disagreed and saw it the other way around even though I provided statistics of hate crimes against Jews. I told her, 'No problem.' And we said our warm and friendly goodbye.Two more weeks went by, and there was a Zoom event taking place from the New York Consulate also about the Ethiopian Jews (Beta Israel). My friend Raffi Berg, Middle East Editor of BBC Online is the author of the book, 'Red Sea Spies,' the story of how the Israeli Mossad set up Operation Brothers in a fake diving resort in Sudan, to rescue 7,000 Ethiopian Jews and get them safely to Israel. The program also featured Commander of the Mossad Dani Limor. Here is the link[3]for that event which starts three minutes after opening:I also sent the announcement for this wonderful event to my Liberal friend. To follow up and make sure she could open the Zoom account, I called, but she didn't answer. So I left a message. No response. Then I called again and left a message. No response. I decided to send an email. No response. This was quite unusual for my Liberal friend usually gets right back to me. I actually started getting worried something happened to her.

Complaints are soaring, too, during a time when many people are already on edge due to the pandemic, of course. Mola Lenghi is in New York where the barrage is literally keeping people up at night. Mola, how bad is it?
MOLA LENGHI (CBS News Correspondent): Well, Anthony, people have been reporting this problem really from coast to coast. Here in Brooklyn, folks say that they`ve been seeing and hearing these illegal fireworks go off almost every single night for weeks. Now firework retailers say they have seen their sales skyrocket, and that is causing some dangerous situations really across the country.
(Begin VT)
MOLA LENGHI: They are in Los Angeles, Baltimore and New York City, powerful displays of illegal fireworks disrupting neighborhoods across the country.
MAN #1: It`s three o`clock in the morning, and then you`re-- you`re waking up, you know, during a big explosion.
MAN #2: My baby takes longer naps during the day because he does not get enough sleep during the night. And he wakes up crying. He used to sleep in this form.
MAN #3: Some of them are firecrackers. Some of them sound like bombs.
MOLA LENGHI: Communities nationwide have seen increases in complaints. In New York City, 911 calls about illegal fireworks shot up more than twelve hundred percent from last year. In Boston, they rose by nearly sixty-five hundred percent. And in Pasadena, California, there was a roughly four hundred sixty percent increase.
KEITH GOMEZ (Pasadena Police Department Sergeant): It`s just skyrocketed this year.
MOLA LENGHI: That`s Pasadena Police Sergeant Keith Gomez who is part of the city`s newly created firework detail.
KEITH GOMEZ: We don`t want people to unnecessarily burn down their home, burn down their neighbor`s home.
MOLA LENGHI: It`s unclear what`s behind the recent spike in dangerous displays, but Maureen Vogel with the National Safety Council told us it could pose major risks.
MAUREEN VOGEL (National Safety Council): We see a lot of injuries occurring to the people who set fireworks off but also to the people who are around them.
MOLA LENGHI: Here in New York City, those concerns prompted Mayor Bill de Blasio to launch a task force targeting illegal fireworks.
BILL DE BLASIO: There will be all sorts of actions taken. Undercover buys, sting operations, finding where the supply is and cutting it off at the knees.
ERIC ADAMS (Brooklyn Borough President): I`ve never witnessed anything like this.
MOLA LENGHI: Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams told us the crackdown will be a test of not just enforcement but community engagement. He is urging residents to think twice before calling 911.
ERIC ADAMS: It`s about how do you find the right balance and not to be heavy-handed as we deal with a nuisance, a nonviolent infraction.
MOLA LENGHI: How do you deal with it?
ERIC ADAMS: I think it`s a combination of a light touch from policing, but a real interaction with everyday citizens and everyday organizations.
(End VT)
MOLA LENGHI: Now Adams there acknowledged that those sounds that people hear, the fireworks going off, can be more than just a nuisance. You know, for some people who may not know what the sounds are, they could think that they are gunshots going off or they might trigger PTSD in other people. So he says he`s been walking the streets of Brooklyn at night, trying to find the people who are launching them to try to explain the dangers to them. Anthony.
ANTHONY MASON: Mola, thank you.
I-- Gayle, I`ve only heard-- I`ve heard one or two, and they are very startling.
GAYLE KING: Yeah.
ANTHONY MASON: But I`m hearing complaints all over the place about them.
GAYLE KING: Well, I don`t hear them on the Upper West Side. But I do hear that it`s a serious problem when you think what it could trigger in people. It`s not a good thing, so be careful.
ANTHONY MASON: Right.
GAYLE KING: Or we could break out into Katy Perry`s ""Firework"" song.
ANTHONY MASON: Would you like to do that?
GAYLE KING: If you will do with me.
ANTHONY MASON: No, I`m not doing it with you.

(ANNOUNCEMENTS)
TONY DOKOUPIL: Time now for What to Watch with Vlad Duthiers. Vlad, we`ve been joking for a couple of days that until baseball comes back, you are America`s pastime. Baseball is now coming back, but I`ve got--
GAYLE KING: Yeah.
TONY DOKOUPIL: --more good news for you. A lot of people have been telling me you`re more exciting than baseball. No comment from me.
GAYLE KING: Did Vlad`s mother call you, Tony?
VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: I wonder if--
GAYLE KING: Vlad`s mother call you again?
VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Vitamin V-- I wonder if people telling you, Tony, is my mom.
ANTHONY MASON: Yeah.
VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: But we`ll talk about that after the show.
TONY DOKOUPIL: Yeah.
VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Good to see all of you.
We`re taking a look at some of the stories we think you`ll be talking about today, including this--Bill Cosby has won a new appeal of his 2018 sexual assault conviction. The eighty-two-year-old is nearly two years into a three to ten-year prison term for drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand at his home back in 2004. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court agreed yesterday to review two aspects of the case. The first involves the judge`s decision to allow testimony from five other accusers who alleged long ago sexual assault by Cosby. The court will also review Cosby`s claim that he had an agreement with a former prosecutor that he would never be charged in the case. In a statement, Constand asked the court to consider the prospect of putting, quote, ""my perpetrator back into the community"" when he has shown no remorse for his actions.
All right. Now to this, at least seventeen high school students from Ohio tested positive for coronavirus after a recent trip to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Officials say two people who came in contact with those teenagers have also been diagnosed with COVID-19. Nearly one hundred students returned home to Belmont County, Ohio, from the resort city eleven days ago. The number of cases is expected to rise as more people who went on the trip, or came into contact with the students get tested for the virus. The county previously had reduced infection rates to zero. Gayle, Myrtle Beach saw another day of triple-digit increases for the county which officials have labeled a hot spot.
GAYLE KING: And every time this happens, people have big regrets. I saw a Doctor Tom Frieden the other day, former head of the CDC. He said, listen, we`re all sick and tired of coronavirus. But the virus is not tired of making us sick. And I think that`s a really good way to look at it, you have to be careful with the reopening.
Vlad, your next story is all about girl power. I know I like it already. I have no clue what you`re talking about, but I like girl power.
VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: All right. Let me lay this on you, Gayle. The Pasadena Fire Department in California is noting a remarkable milestone. For the first time in its one-hundred-and-thirty-three-year history, the engine crew rolling out of Station 34 yesterday was all female. One of the women said it is a moment she will never forget.
CHRISTINA TERRAZAS: The guys get to experience that every day, and as much as we enjoy working with them and they love working with us, it`s really nice to enjoy this experience today.
VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Move isn`t permanent. It just so happens that the female firefighters were all assigned to work on the same day. But, Anthony, this trend will continue. The department is hosting a summer program for girls who want to be firefighters.
ANTHONY MASON: Yeah. I love that idea. There are actually a hundred and fifty members of the Pasadena Fire Department. Eight of them are women. So, that`s literally half of the-- the female staff of the department who went out. It`s-- maybe only be a one-time thing, but it was cool to see.
Vlad, you got some-- some a funny video for us.
VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: All right. So, we usually try to leave folks with a smile. But today, get ready for a laugh. NFL safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix can tackle pretty much anything on the field. But a new Instagram video he posted shows he is not completely fearless. Watch what happens when he encounters a bear and its cub. The six-foot-one, two-hundred-and-eleven- pounder who played for the Bears last year, he can`t make this stuff up, stop his scooter and runs for his life. Homina, homina, homina, homina, homina. No one was hurt. The bears were scared off.
TONY DOKOUPIL: It`s so great.
ANTHONY MASON: The bears looked more scared than he was.
VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: It`s like he`s just moseying along, do, do, do, do, do, do and all of a sudden--
GAYLE KING: Oh, God. He said-- he said I never liked that scooter anyway. That was great, Vlad.
TONY DOKOUPIL: Yes.
VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: He just hops off--
TONY DOKOUPIL: Pretty good turn there.
VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: --and, like, runs the other way.
GAYLE KING: And his name is Ha Ha?
ANTHONY MASON: Yes.
GAYLE KING: Well, there`s so many layers to that one.
TONY DOKOUPIL: He-- he played for the Bears last season.
ANTHONY MASON: That`s true.
TONY DOKOUPIL: He played for the Bears last season, confronted those bears, ran away.
VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: (INDISTINCT).
TONY DOKOUPIL: And he`s kind of-- he`s kind of running away in real life from the bears. He is not running away, running away. But he`s now signed for the-- with the Dallas Cowboys. So making a change in his driveway, also probably making a change in real life.
All right. Vlad, thank you very much.
Ahead, we talk to NASCAR--

*************************************************************************** ** (8:00 AM, EDT)
GAYLE KING: Hey, it`s Wednesday, June 24, 2020, hump day. Welcome back to CBS THIS MORNING. I am Gayle King with Tony Dokoupil and Anthony Mason.
Pivotal moment. Coronavirus cases are rising, and Doctor Anthony Fauci says it`s a critical time. How his message differs sharply from what the President is saying.
TONY DOKOUPIL: Driving progress. We talk to NASCAR`s Bubba Wallace about a surprise twist after a noose was found in his Talladega garage.
ANTHONY MASON: And flipping the script. Gloria Steinem on her lifetime of activism and a new play about her life starring Oscar-winner Christine Lahti.
GAYLE KING: Go, Gloria.
But first, here`s today`s Eye Opener @ 8.
Doctor Anthony Fauci told Congress yesterday the coronavirus is not going to disappear. But at a rally in Arizona, President Trump once again claimed the virus is going away.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We`re doing so well after the plague. It`s going away.
TONY DOKOUPIL: The FBI now says a noose found by NASCAR`s Bubba Wallace had been there for several months at least.
JERICKA DUNCAN: NASCAR says it will continue its own investigation into why there was a noose there in the first place.
ANTHONY MASON: Former National Security Adviser John Bolton is hitting back at President Trump.
JOHN BOLTON: His decision-making is not anchored in any discernible philosophy.
MAN: Foodies in Ohio want to rename the city of Columbus to Flavortown. It`s all in honor of celebrity restaurateur Guy Fieri.
JAMES CORDEN: Guy Fieri. He`s much more deserving of having a town named after him than Christopher Columbus. Now some people might argue that Columbus discovered America, which is seeming less impressive with every passing day. But, Guy Fieri, he discovered all of this.
GUY FIERI: Peanut butter burger.
MAN: Duck tongue tacos.
GUY FIERI: Woh, woh, woh, woh.
The weirdest grilled cheese.
Dragon`s Breath chili.
Super Duper Weenie.
They are like mop sauce.
JAMES CORDEN: The choice is clear. Congratulations, Ohio, and welcome to Flavortown.
GAYLE KING: Flavortown. Super Duper Weenie sounds pretty good to me.
ANTHONY MASON: I liked the grilled cheese myself.
GAYLE KING: Give me some mustard and onions. I think it`s good.
TONY DOKOUPIL: Peanut butter burger, it`s great to me.
GAYLE KING: Yeah.
ANTHONY MASON: Yeah.
GAYLE KING: Some of that stuff sounds good.
ANTHONY MASON: Getting hungry here.
GAYLE KING: I know some Super Duper Weenies.
Welcome back to CBS THIS MORNING. Tony, good to see you.
ANTHONY MASON: There`s a toss, Tony.
GAYLE KING: Yeah.
TONY DOKOUPIL: Good to see you, guys.
GAYLE KING: Take it, Tony. Take it.
TONY DOKOUPIL: All right. We`re going to begin with this, one of our nation`s top health officials had issued a warning about what he calls a disturbing rise in the coronavirus. During Capitol Hill testimony yesterday, Doctor Anthony Fauci pleaded with Americans to remain cautious, to wear masks and follow guidelines.
DR. ANTHONY FAUCI (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director): Right now, the next couple of weeks are going to be critical in our ability to address those surgings that we`re seeing in Florida, in Texas, in Arizona and in other states.
ANTHONY MASON: At least twenty-six states have seen surges in daily coronavirus cases over the past two weeks. That includes Arizona where President Trump held a rally in Phoenix yesterday. Most of the approximately three thousand people in the crowd did not wear masks in violation of a city order, including the President who claimed the virus is going away.
GAYLE KING: Federal investigators say that NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace was not the target of a hate crime, following the discovery of a noose in his Talladega garage. They also say the noose had been in the garage since as early as October. Now that was before Wallace was assigned to the space. On Monday, in a powerful show of support, NASCAR drivers and crew members escorted him and his number forty-three car on to the track. It`s a powerful scene. Wallace is the only full-time black driver at NASCAR`s top level. He had advocated for NASCAR`s recent ban of the Confederate battle flag. Bubba Wallace joins us now to discuss his latest turn of events. Bubba, it`s really good to see you. I want to start with the federal investigators` conclusion no crime was con-- committed. Therefore, they say, there will be no federal charges. How are you processing this latest turn of events?
BUBBA WALLACE (NASCAR Driver): Yeah. I know, it was a relief that, you know, I wasn`t targeted or anything. But-- but, yeah, I was-- and I was delivered the-- the information when it all went down Sunday afternoon, Sunday evening, and was just kind of following set there knowing that it was in NASCAR`s hands and that I didn`t report it. I was just delivered the information, so.
GAYLE KING: No. You were told by the head of NASCAR, you said--
BUBBA WALLACE: Yeah.
GAYLE KING: --he came to you in a very emotional state saying that this had happened. How could something-- this is what I don`t get, Bubba, how could it have been there for nine months and no one noticed it before? I-- I don`t understand that.
BUBBA WALLACE: Yeah. I`m not sure either. You know, I guess we`re-- we`re all kind of hypersensitive to what`s going on in the world right now. And-- and my crew member looked-- just looked over and-- and seen, you know, what was in the shape of a noose. And it, in fact, was a noose. I`ve seen the footage or the-- the video-- or, I`m sorry, the picture--
GAYLE KING: Yeah.
BUBBA WALLACE: --of the-- of the garage pull as we want to call it to-- to make everybody happy here. That, you know, it was, in fact, the shape of a noose. The FBI backed that up one hundred percent. Never thought I`d be talking to FBI.
GAYLE KING: Mm-Hm.
BUBBA WALLACE: But-- but they said absolutely it is a noose. Not a functioning noose, but it is a noose. And they were curious on why that was even hanging, as well. So--
GAYLE KING: And didn`t you say--
BUBBA WALLACE: --all in all, it`s resolved. And we move on from it.
GAYLE KING: --didn`t you say, Bubba, that it was hanging over your car? Didn`t you say that it was hanging over your specific car, your area?
BUBBA WALLACE: It was in my garage bay, I never seen it personally.
GAYLE KING: You never saw it.
BUBBA WALLACE: I never, you know, walked up and seen it. Yeah, I never seen it.
GAYLE KING: So do you think that you were the target of a hate crime? I know what the federal investigators were saying. What do you think happened here?
BUBBA WALLACE: No, I don`t-- I don`t-- I don`t think I was. You know, when I-- when I heard the news, I-- I wasn`t immediately, you know, scared of-- or-- or, you know, afraid of-- of-- of whatever it was.
GAYLE KING: Mm-Hm.
BUBBA WALLACE: So I still-- I-- I don`t feel that way. I mean, yeah, we`re all entitled to our opinions and-- and, you know, a lot of people were unhappy with the removal of the Confederate flag at NASCAR events. And some have taken it, like we`re getting rid of that out of their personal lives. So I don`t really understand that logic on thinking. But you can`t help some people in today`s world. But we`ll just keep moving on. We`ll keep pushing the needle and-- and fighting for-- for what`s right in this sport. And-- and I`ll continue to stand proudly where I am.
ANTHONY MASON: Bubba, you got extraordinary display of support from other drivers on the track the other day. But I imagine this has got to be-- this has been pretty exhausting all of this to go through. How are you doing?
BUBBA WALLACE: Uh-Huh. All good.
ANTHONY MASON: You`re doing okay?
BUBBA WALLACE: All good. Ready to go to-- ready to go to Pocono.
ANTHONY MASON: What did you-- what did you-- what did you think of that display of support that you received the other day?
GAYLE KING: Very touching.
BUBBA WALLACE: Yeah. It was for sure was emotional. It, you know, definitely a moment that will stand out for me for-- forever, knowing that the support was there. You know, I know everybody in the garage has each other`s backs. And we-- we-- we-- we don`t show it because we`re competitors. And maybe that`s a-- considered a sign of-- of weakness and that we could kind of attack on that. But knowing that, you know, we have that family support, that`s how NASCAR is. It was good to see, and I definitely appreciate that.
GAYLE KING: I really hope, Bubba, that this wasn`t a hate crime directed at you. That it-- that would be very good news. But talked to your mom the other day, she said something very interesting to me. She said sometimes God will put your enemies in a position that you use them as a footstool to elevate and rise above it and don`t let anybody question your character or your integrity. You seem to have taken that message, her words, to heart. Do you feel you`re being tested?
BUBBA WALLACE: She is my mom.
GAYLE KING: Yeah. Yeah, she is.
BUBBA WALLACE: Oh, for sure. I`m-- I`m-- I`m-- I`m being tested each and every day throughout this whole matter, whether it`s right, wrong, or indifferent. You know, it`s-- that`s-- that`s how life is. People want to dethrone you from the pedestal that you`re on when you have a platform and when you have a voice. And I`ve got a strong support system behind me, you know, including my mom, my sister--
GAYLE KING: Yeah.
BUBBA WALLACE: --my dad--
GAYLE KING: Mm-Hm.
BUBBA WALLACE: --my-- my girlfriend. And so they are all keeping me standing up tall when I-- when I get down, and frustrated like I am now. But I still know the path that I am destined to be on--
GAYLE KING: Mm-Hm.
BUBBA WALLACE: --and I`m walking that proudly with my head held high.
ANTHONY MASON: Bubba, what`s frustrating-- what`s frustrating you right now? What`s frustrating you the most right now?
BUBBA WALLACE: I think that`s obvious to everybody. How they want to turn it into a hoax when I was just rational thoughts off the factual information that I was given, so.
ANTHONY MASON: Yeah.
GAYLE KING: Yeah.
BUBBA WALLACE: Yep.
GAYLE KING: Yeah. Bubba, I have to say you do seem-- seem a little down, a little frustrated. I`m wondering how you`re going to move forward because, listen, you have a lot of support from-- you have a lot of support from people who-- who are cheering you on, who don`t appreciate what you`ve been through, who don`t appreciate now that people are trying to change the narrative of this story. And I-- I hope that you will hang on to that. But it is concerning to me, you do seem a little down and-- and upset by this. Who is helping you get through?
BUBBA WALLACE: It will be all right.
GAYLE KING: It will be all right?
BUBBA WALLACE: Yeah. It will-- it will be okay. Honestly, the best medicine for me is-- will be Saturday and Sunday when I`m in the race car and can get away from all the madness for a few hours, it`s good.
GAYLE KING: All right, Bubba Wallace. We will be cheering you on, on the track. Please be careful, please stay safe. Thank you very much.
BUBBA WALLACE: Thank you.
GAYLE KING: Thanks for your time today.
ANTHONY MASON: Thanks, Bubba.

GAYLE KING: Mm-Hm.
ANTHONY MASON: --a couple of days ago and how down he seems.
GAYLE KING: No. We`re both still sitting here still very unsettled by it because you can see he feels-- he seems very defeated.
ANTHONY MASON: Yeah.
GAYLE KING: And it`s so unfortunate, Anthony, to have the word hoax associated with this. Number one, he didn`t call attention to this.
ANTHONY MASON: No, he didn`t.
GAYLE KING: It was brought to his attention and said--
ANTHONY MASON: By NASCAR.
GAYLE KING: By NASCAR.
ANTHONY MASON: Yep.
GAYLE KING: And so now for anybody to question it and say it`s not a noose, it was a rope pull, whatever it is--
ANTHONY MASON: Yep.
GAYLE KING: --to say it`s not a hate crime, I still don`t really know what- - what-- what happened here.
ANTHONY MASON: Yeah.
GAYLE KING: But it-- it`s very painful to see how personally he is taking it. He says he is fine.
ANTHONY MASON: Yeah, yeah.
GAYLE KING: But you can look at him and see that he is not fine.
ANTHONY MASON: Yeah.
GAYLE KING: I`m very unsettled by that conversation.
ANTHONY MASON: It-- it-- yeah, it was a very unsettling interview. But the thing is he`s been incredibly courageous--
GAYLE KING: Yes."
93,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1251/Files (250).DOCX","The Irish Times",2020-07-11,"1107 words","SPORT; Pg. 23","Keith Duggan",NA,"Trump doing so much winning when it comes to his tweet storms on sports",FALSE,"Donald J Trump has issued 53,500 tweets (and counting) since he made his social media debut back in 2009 when he was just a symbol of Big Apple excess and vulgarity. 
There can be no question that when future biographers and historians sit down to account for the most grotesque presidential cycle in the history of the republic, they will be poring over those messages - and the millions of replies, both outraged and approving - which they have generated.
Phil Graham, the former Washington Post owner, is credited with the old saying that journalism is the first draft of history. But now that the Lamestream Fake News media empire has been outed by POTUS, the first draft on the life of the Donald belongs to his personal Twitter feed and its slow demonstration of a mind turning more bleak and narrow and paranoid as the pressure mounted and the limitations - of his curiosity, his empathy, his know-how - were exposed. This week, for instance, the big guy had sports on his mind. 
Even as America's coronavirus case numbers continue to soar ominously in several states and dark clouds gather over the opaque history of his personal wealth, the 45th president of the United States spent this dull and feckless July week - devoid of celebrity golf tourneys, of Mar-a-Lago events, of global conferences - firing out broadsides in the direction of Nascar and American football. 
Over a fortnight has passed since the FBI concluded that a hate crime was not behind the presence of a noose hanging in a speedway garage assigned to Bubba Wallace, Nascar's only African-American race driver and the person who led calls for the removal of the Confederate flag from the race tracks. 
The photo of the noose, with its obvious connotations, looks sinister. It was clearly knotted by someone. No other garage had its pull-rope tied into a noose. But the investigation concluded that it could find nothing premeditated and that the noose had been there before the garage stalls were even assigned to drivers; that it had been a bizarre coincidence.
Black Lives Matter movement 
Nascar issued a statement of relief and an inevitable firestorm of debate quickly flared on social media, with all kinds of conspiracy theories, including the inevitable accusation that Wallace had perpetrated some kind of hoax. In fact, the driver wasn't the person who discovered the noose and wasn't even aware that it had been reported to Nascar, who initiated the investigation. 
Over the summer Wallace has emerged as a prominent advocate for the Black Lives Matter movement. When he was told about the noose, he quickly posted his reaction on Twitter, saying that ""today's despicable act of racism and hatred leaves me incredibly saddened and serves as a reminder of how much further we have to go as a society"". That was June 22nd.
Two days later, the federal investigation ruled out the general assumption that the noose had been left there as a deliberate symbol of hate. Immediately, the driver faced a predictable few hours of bile and loathing across various platforms. In an interview on CNN, Wallace admitted that the backlash was left him feeling frustrated and ""pissed"". ""Are you reading social media?"" the interviewer asked him and when Wallace conceded that he was, he half counselled: ""Don't. Don't.""
And because the world is so frayed and distracted and under siege from economic and viral stresses, the moment seemed to have passed until, from some reason, in entered the mind of the Donald on Tuesday.
You imagine the big guy padding around the interior of the White House, restless and malcontented as he walked in the literal footsteps of Eisenhower, of LBJ, of Obama and maybe coming across a Nascar item when flicking over to SportsCenter. And remembering then how much Bubba Wallace gets on his wick. 
Out with the phone, on to Twitter and wondering: ""Has Bubba Wallace apologized to all of those great NASCAR drivers and officials who came to his aid, stood by his side and were willing to sacrifice everything for him, only to find out that the whole thing was just another HOAX? That & Flag decision has caused lowest ratings EVER!' 
The message contained Trump's Twitter trade marks - the capitalisation for emphasis, the depressing laziness when it comes to spelling ""and"", the exclamation marks. And it was also further evidence of how Trump regards everything in the world, including the governance of his country, as an ongoing popularity contest in which decisions must be based on ratings rather than on fairness or justice or ethics or any of that stuff. 
Washington Redskins 
The reference to ""all those great Nascar drivers"" concerned the march, in solidarity, behind Wallace's car by his fellow competitors. Trump's jumbling of the noose-discovery with the principled decision to end the sport's association with the Confederate flag is just another example of where he stands during this delicate and volatile moment in America's struggle with its own racial history. 
On the same day, his mind wandered towards the imminent demise of the team name of Washington's long-standing NFL team, the Redskins. With major retailers withdrawing their merchandise, the writing is on the wall. And Trump is sickened, noting that ""they name teams out of STRENGTH, not weakness but now the Washington Redskins and Cleveland Indians look like they are going to be changing their names in order to be politically correct. Indians, like Elizabeth Warren, must be very angry right now!"" 
Soon, he moved on ""the China Virus"" but not before he got 52,000 retweets for his thoughts on the Redskins. Trump's scattergun bluster and hatred is so generalised and predictably volatile by this stage that his Twitter messages receive nothing like the attention they did during the first year of his presidency. 
Even Wallace, after acknowledging that it was weird to imagine that the president of the United States was thinking about him, particularly during a fearful global summer defined by a pandemic and a fierce economic storm, laughed it off. 
It is comforting to interpret the tweets as evidence of Trump under pressure; that the messages were fired out as a distraction from the imminent news that the supreme court has ruled that New York prosecutors can examine the president's financial records to scrutinise his tax returns, a move he has blocked throughout his presidency. 
But by the time that privilege has passed through the machinations of the lower courts, the November election date will have passed. And Trump might be back in the White House. By then, Washington may well have a newly named football team but nothing else will be changing for the better."

Voting has always been a symbol of power for me and my family. Growing up, I'd watch my grandfather and father educate themselves on the campaigns, stances, and political backgrounds of the people running for office by watching interviews, debates, and reading newspapers. They'd try to inform themselves to make sure they were making the correct decisions. To them, being politically knowledgeable was a civic duty to not only their country but, more importantly, to their community.
Oftentimes, my family would look at the candidates and if it got down to it, they'd ask themselves, ""Which one is Latinx?"" There was this sense of unspoken community that so many Latinx individuals have shared with me over the years of just being Latinx and supporting each other without reservations. That community power and pride is very necessary in this year's election because so much of the Latinx community continues to suffer under President Donald Trump's administration.
As someone who is Latinx and gay, this election will have a massive impact on my future in the United States. In 2018, while my community was racially profiled as ""rapists"" and ""drug dealers"" by the current president, anti-Latinx hate crimes went up 21%. These instances are only a few examples of the mistreatment we have faced under this administration.
The most pressing reason, for me, to vote is the brutal treatment of Latinx people at the border. We must remember the neglect and abuse that our sister Roxsana Hernandez Rodriguez, a transgender woman from Honduras who died within an ICE facility, endured. Many Latinxs, such as Roxsana, are just looking for safety in the United States. Many countries in Central and South America are not as accepting, and sometimes violent towards LGBTQ people, therefore many queer and trans people from these countries look to the United States for refuge. From general harassment to murder, LGBTQ+ Latinxs are forced to come to the United States for a chance at life. This is why it is so important to vote for candidates that understand how serious this situation is. We need compassionate and intelligent leadership in all offices open for re-election this year. Just remember that their voices need yours in order to be amplified and make an impact.
Another reason why I am voting in this election is because my community is disproportionately affected by COVID-19. According to the Human Rights Campaign, nearly 34% of New York City's coronavirus deaths are Latinxs even though they account for 29% of the city's population. Long-standing economic disparities between white Americans and people of color have caused these outbreaks to impact Latinx and Black communities disproportionately. Latinx and Black residents of the United States are three times more likely to become infected with COVID-19 and twice as likely to die from the virus as compared to their white counterparts. Latinx individuals are also put in danger more often due to the types of jobs they are - in some cases - forced to take. Under the current administration, this trend will likely continue. The only way we can change this is by voting for representatives that will fight for us and a president who cares.
Voting is not only our responsibility but it is also a privilege. Not everyone living in this country can vote but all of us are affected by the outcome of the election. For every undocumented Latinx individual, this election decides their futures in the United States and we need to think of them when we vote.
In 2020, 32 million Latinx individuals will be eligible to vote. This could turn the tide of the election toward a more secure and just future. We need to remember as a community that this election is not just about our own individual struggles but the multitude of struggles that our community faces."
95,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1251/Files (250).DOCX","EFE Newswire - Americas in Focus",2020-06-28,"1179 words",NA,"int/dm/amg/bp",NA,"LGTB+ groups cancel marches due to pandemic, but not demands for equality; GLOBAL PRIDE",FALSE,"International Desk, Jun 28 (EFE). - The coronavirus pandemic forced the worldwide LGTB+ community to cancel in-person marches and Gay Pride parties on the weekend but not to scale back their demands for equality, which they have lobbied for this year online and at assorted smaller demonstrations.
The Internet has been the place where the Global Pride 2020 festival is being celebrated this weekend, among the online events being a concert with artists such as pop icon Elton John performing from their homes, and the ""Can't Cancel Pride"" concert at which Ricky Martin and Katy Perry performed, or Pride Inside offering chats and other activities through July 5.
Each country is also holding virtual conferences and discussions regarding the particular demands being made by LGTB+ groups worldwide.
In Belgium, one of the few countries in which the Gay Pride festival is being held in the traditional way - albeit in August - between now and then organizers are preparing the events and discussion influenced by concern over the health crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
The Belgian Pride association, which is coordinating the event along with other LGTB+ groups, said that this year the Belgian Gay Pride festival will be dedicated to ""mental and physical health.""
The group said is wants to call attention to th emany challenges that must be faced, such as preventing HIV and giving transgender people access to health services.
In addition, the Belgian organizers said that mental health does not seem to be improving, with several studies showing that LGTBI people have a much higher risk of suffering mental health problems, including suicidal thoughts and attempts.
In The Netherlands, an international group of politicians, artists, journalists and former elite athletes - including British songwriter and performer Elton John and the European commissioner for equality, Helena Dalli - published a letter in several media forums in which they warn that the coronavirus has serious social and economic consequences over the long term, especially for minorities.
In Mexico, the so-called Comite Incluye T organized a virtual event that was rebroadcast on the weekend on YouTube, Facebook and Mexican television's Canal Once that included information, discussions and assorted artistic expression under the slogan #ElOrgulloPermanece.
The information capsules revolved around four main themes: recognizing trans people from childhood, recognizing the rights of diverse families, equal rights for everyone and preventing, detecting and providing timely health care for HIV and other illnesses and conditions.
In Italy, the demand this year is very specific: an effective law against homophobia.
This week, it is expected that Italy's Chamber of Deputies will begin examining a bill against homophobia pushed by lawmaker Alessandro Zan, with Italy's center-left Democratic Party (PD), one of the parties comprising the government coalition.
The aim is to strenthen an existing law that since 1993 punishes with up to four years in prison hate crimes committed due to issues of race, ethnicity, religion or nationality, including discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity or misogyny.
The Italian Episcopal Conference has rejected the bill, saying that ""a new law is not necessary"" and is pushing for ""educational commitment to prevent"" cases of discrimination and homophobia.
Italy, where the coronavirus has infected more than 240,000 people and killed 34,700, Gay Pride this year has been commemorated with assorted online and in-person events, although that has not included large gatherings due to the social distancing rules in force to limit the spread of the coronavirus.
In London, meanwhile, although the large parade originally scheduled for Global Pride day was cancelled, a group of people gathered for a demonstration that linked the demands of the gay community to the recent protests against racism.
Another march, amid security measures to prevent Covid-19 infection, was staged by a small group of LGTB+ veterans to hail the 50th anniversary of the pioneer organization founded in New York in 1969 that gave rise to the gay liberation movement.
In Barcelona, there was also an historic demonstration, the first in Spain to demand gay rights, with hundreds of people on Saturday moving through the downtown capital of Catalonia to commemorate the first such demonstration 44 years a few months after the death of long-time dictator Francisco Franco.
The rest of the events in Spain, however, were relegated to the Internet, with the central theme of the discussions and forums to be the role of women in LGTB+ activism
Workshops in educational diversity, sexual health or raising LGTB+ awareness in Latin America were also organized in Spain, and people who are suffering serious forms of psychosocial harm amid the Covid-19 pandemic or the quarantines - including loneliness - were not forgotten in those discussions.
In Moscow, the rainbow gay pride flag was hung from two official buildings, namely the US and UK Embassies, although not from the Russian government headquarters, a move made in solidarity with the LGTB+ community in Russia, which does not enjoy the freedoms accorded to it in other nations.
Although homosexuality stopped being legally considered a crime in Russia in 1993, the country still has a law on the books against gay ""propaganda,"" including gay pride marches.
In Poland, institutional intolerance of gay concerns similar to that in Russia also prevails, sharpened at this point by the presidential election being held on Sunday.
Current Polish President Andrzej Duda said at a campaign event that LGTB+ ""indoctrination"" is ""worse than communism,"" thus backing a lawmaker from his party who declared that ""LGTB+ is not people, it's an ideology.""
Since that remark was uttered, according to activist Ola Kaczorek, there has been an increase in physical attacks on LGT+I people.
In Ecuador, the slogan for the celebration this year did not invite people to the event but rather urged them to continue to seek justice, since the country's LGTBI Federation has registered three hate murders this year: one against a trans woman and two against male homosexuals.
In Berlin, the Gay Pride demonstration kicked off on Saturday with the unveiling of a plaque paying tribute to the gay victims of Naziism, the plaque bearing a pink triangle, which was the symbol the Nazi regime required all identified homosexuals to wear.
There, police said, the crowd at the march was estimated at some 3,500 people, one of the largest gatherings around the world.
The most festive atmosphere was felt amid a demonstration in Taipei, where some 300 people gathered on a city square for Taiwan's commemoration of Gay Pride.
In Argentina, city officials illuminated the country's main monuments with the rainbow colors of the LGTB+ flag.
And, in Israel, thousands turned out for a series of Gay Pride events and festivals in Tel Aviv, Jeruselam, Haifa and Beersheba after the marches scheduled for early June had to be cancelled due to the coronavirus.

JOHN KING, CNN HOST: Thanks for joining us as we start the work week. I hope to see you back here this time tomorrow as well.
Brianna Keilar picks up our coverage right now. Have a good day.
BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: I'm Brianna Keilar and I want to welcome viewers here in the U.S. and around the world.
We begin with a dangerous new turn in the coronavirus pandemic. Nearly half of all U.S. states are seeing a jump in new coronavirus cases, 11 states are seeing spikes of more than 50 percent here in the past week. The number of confirmed cases in the U.S. is now at more than 2,286,000 and more than 120,000 deaths.
Officials in states across the south have warned that more young people in their 20s and their 30s are now testing positive. One infectious disease expert comparing the months to a forest fire. Globally, the World Health Organization reported the largest single day increase in more than 183,000 new cases on Sunday. That was driven mostly by spikes in Brazil and also here in the U.S.
CNN's Tom Foreman is with me now on this. Tom, tell us where we're seeing the most increases stateside here.
TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Brianna, it is stretching from coast to coast. If you take a look at the current map, remember, everything that's red or dark red, that's where they're seeing an increase. And you can see there are pockets down there in the southeast, the middle of the country and, of course, the west is just getting hammered with the tremendous number of cases out there.
Bri, you and I have been looking at these maps for weeks and weeks now. This is as bad as it's been, I think, to see it spread this wide and in so many place where they thought it would be getting better.
Take a look at Arizona where the president is going for his next rally this week where he's hoping to have a big turnout there. He's going to go down to the border, he's going to have a rally at a church that holds about 3,000 people.
Arizona has been seeing its cases jump up recently to about 2,400 new cases every single day. That is enormous. And it's not just a little bleep of the past few days. If you look back over Arizona's track since early on in June, this has been steadily growing and the number of cases and the number of hospitalizations so much so that Arizona absolutely is a hotspot on this first day of summer with no sign of it getting any easier down there.
They have just enacted a new mask law in Phoenix, where the president will hold this rally. Of course, he has turned away from masks many, many times and many his followers have too. Not clear what will happen at this event, even though the city says they won't be looking for mask enforcement there.
Nonetheless, Arizona absolutely one of the hottest spots in the country right now but look at this. Compared to the top five states, look at the other ones that are in there, terrifically bad numbers in a number of states and leading them all right now is Florida, which really was a place where they hoped it wouldn't be so bad, now it absolutely is. Brianna?
KEILAR: That's right. They had had some high hopes. It seemed to be tracking well for a bit there. Tom, thank you. Good to see you.
An alarming milestone in Florida, as Tom was just outlining, the state now reporting more than 100,000 cases and the big reason for that jump. Just look at the new number of new cases in the last three days here, more than 11,000 since Friday.
CNN's Rosa Flores is in Miami Beach for us. Tell us about how the hospitals are looking there, Rosa.
ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Brianna. Well, it's very difficult to tell how hospitals are doing in relation to COVID-19 patients because the State of Florida does not issue those numbers. However, we have been getting a glimpse of what's going on because Jackson Health, one of the major health systems here in the State of Florida, has issued those numbers. And in the past two weeks, there has been a 75 percent increase.
Now, here in Florida, according to Governor Ron DeSantis, what is driving the uptick in coronavirus cases right now are young people, not social distancing, not wearing masks out and about. So that's why we hit the street to kind of show you what's actually going on.
We are in Miami Beach, we're at a restaurant. And here is what it's like to dine at a restaurant. You get a one-use menu and you can see that the tables are at least six feet apart.
And if you look beyond this restaurant, you will see that restaurants have spilled over on to the street because that gives them a little more room to spread out to allow people to social distance. And you can see that there are multiple layers of restaurants that are doing the same thing.
Now, Brianna, here, you could tell that people are social distancing. You're required to wear a mask, like I am, while you're not sitting down dining. But over the weekend, three restaurants were closed here in Miami-Dade because they were not following the rules and that is the message both locally and from the State of Florida inspections will be going up as the number of coronavirus cases also increase. Brianna?
KEILAR: All right. Rosa, thank you for showing us what's happening there in Miami Beach.
New York City is now entering a phase two of its coronavirus reopening plan today and this means that offices, hair salons, barbershops, car dealerships and outdoor dining, among other things, are going to be allowed to resume.
CNN's Alexandra Field has more from New York.
ALEXANDRA FIELD, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Brianna, this is a big step for New York's comeback. Just behind me, a sight that we haven't seen in the city for months now, people able to eat at restaurants and bars, that is as long as they are doing it outside on the sidewalks.
Along with bringing back the restaurant industry, other big steps we are seeing in-store retail sales now open to people, also the comeback of the real estate market. You can even go to your salon or barbershops, milestones that people in this city have been looking forward to.
This was once the epicenter of the virus, but New York has made remarkable progress. The positivity rates on tests is now than 1 percent across the state. In order to hold the progress that New Yorkers have made, the governor signed executive order that will strictly enforce social distancing. it could lead to the suspension of liquor licenses for bars and restaurants that don't closely follow the guidelines. Brianna?
KEILAR: Thank you, Alexandra.
And a promising new report development from the maker of remdesivir, the antiviral drug that has been effective at treating COVID patients. Gilead Sciences announced it is about to start trials of an inhaled version of the medication, which is currently only available by intravenous infusion. The hope here is that an inhaled version could more easily distributed in earlier phases of infection.
With me now to discuss is June Ellis. She is an Associate Chief Nursing Officer at Jackson Health System in Miami. June, thank you so much for being with us.
Your network is reporting a 75 percent increase in cases, so tell us really what you are seeing in your hospitals there.
JUNE ELLIS, ASSOCIATE CHIEF NURSING OFFICER, JACKSON HEALTH SYSTEM: Yes, good afternoon, Brianna. We have seen a significant increase in the last week or so of COVID positive patients coming into the Jackson Health System. At our peak, prior to April, we were seeing about -- or around April, about 167 patients. Today, we spiked to 204, which is really the first time that we have been over 200.
And we are seeing a significant amount of patients in their younger years. in our peak we were seeing more of the over 65-year-old age group.
KEILAR: So tell us about that. Because as you're seeing the spike in cases and people who are in their 20s and 30s, and this isn't just happening in Florida, it's happening in Texas, it's happening in Georgia, why do you think that's happening?
ELLIS: You know, we have to speculate that it has to go hand in hand with the opening and we are seeing a lot of the younger population not wearing masks, getting back to their routine as normal as they can be and not social distancing. We know it is proven that masks and social distancing does help to prevent the COVID virus.
KEILAR: Yes. No, it certainly does, right? It's proven that it saved lives.
I want to ask you about something the president said in Tulsa over the weekend at his campaign rally. He said, when you increase testing for COVID-19, you find more cases. And he claims that he asked officials to, quote, slow down the testing. The White House now says he was joking but it's actually something similar to what we have heard him say many times before.
Even if that's true though, I mean, the deaths don't lie. We're nearing 120,000 deaths. What do you think about this possibility or this joke of slowing down testing?
ELLIS: I think it's important for people to be tested if they are exhibiting any symptoms whatsoever. I don't believe we should slow down on the testing. It's important for us to know the status of patients, our healthcare workers, your father, your mother, et cetera, because then we can quarantine and we can assist with treatments.
If we slow down in the testing, we don't know then exactly that. We're not going to know and we could be sitting next to someone who possibly is positive.
KEILAR: Do you think the spikes are solely attributable to there being testing or are the spikes real and it's attributable to there being more cases?
ELLIS: Obviously, if we test more, you're going to get more information. I think what's important to notice is the more testing is the positivity of the test. So if we're seeing more positives throughout this testing, then that's an important factor.
A lot of people test positive. We have seen it and here at our hospital. They test positive and they're totally asymptomatic.
[13:10:00]
But they still should quarantine for the 14 days because we don't really know if they are contagious. We assume they are. It's a novel virus. We are not sure what happens with the virus itself.
So it's important for patients to get -- people to get tested.
KEILAR: Yes. All right, June Ellis, thank you so much. We really appreciate your perspective down there in Miami. Thanks.
ELLIS: Thank you.
KEILAR: NASCAR is investigating a noose found in the garage of Bubba Wallace, a black NASCAR driver. Hear who was inside of the building where it was found.
Plus, the NYPD suspending an officer for a, quote, disturbing chokehold on a black man. I'll show you what happened.
And the future of President Trump's rallies are now in question after sources say the president is angry about the turnout in Tulsa.
This is CNN's special live coverage.
[13:15:00]
KEILAR: NASCAR is now investigating a potential hate crime. Officials say a noose was found inside Bubba Wallace's garage. Wallace is the sport's only full-time African-American driver. Two weeks ago, he drove a car promoting the Black Lives Matter movement and he also led the initiative to ban confederate flags from NASCAR events.
NASCAR has really released a statement saying, quote, we are angry and outraged and cannot state strongly enough how seriously we take this heinous act. We have launched an immediate investigation and will do everything we can to identify the person or persons responsible and eliminate them from the sport.
I am joined by Brehanna Daniels. She is the first African-American woman to work on a NASCAR pit crew, which I can't overstate just how significant that is. Brehanna, thank you so much for being with us.
You learned about this noose in Bubba Wallace's garage. Tell us your reaction.
BREHANNA DANIELS, FIRST BLACK WOMAN TO JOIN A NASCAR PIT CREW: You know, hearing about that just made me very angry because it's sad, you know? As soon as NASCAR was going in a positive direction, something like this happens. But the individual who committed this act, this is an individual who is not with the change that's happening obviously.
And this is not what NASCAR represents at all, because we're a family in NASCAR and we don't do things like this. So I hope whoever is involved with placing the noose in Bubba's garage gets -- you know, they get what they deserve and they're banned forever, from coming to the racing events and everything else because stuff like that is very, very disturbing and it shows you that racism still exists. And at the end of the day you can only pray for people like that.
Like I said, NASCAR, that's not what NASCAR represents, activities like that and people who commit things like that. That's not what NASCAR is about. KEILAR: And, you know, one of the things I think is this was in a garage stall. It's almost like someone, you know, for the uninitiated about how this works, this isn't an area that everyone has access to, right? This is like walking into your office and there is a noose there. So who would have had access to this?
DANIELS: Yes. As everyone knows that fans really aren't -- people who aren't a part of NASCAR, they're not allowed in the racing events right now, which makes it even more interesting to learn about who really is behind this, you know, because of we don't know.
And, unfortunately, there aren't -- I don't think there are that many cameras around in the garage areas to have even seen like who could be behind this. So to know that had to be someone like within who's -- I guess who's a part of some of the teams. It had to be somebody who's in the garage area who's behind this.
So -- but I said, I hope NASCAR finds out who this person was so we can just remove them altogether because that's not what NASCAR is about.
I'm behind NASCAR all the way. This is very -- this behavior is very disgusting. Whoever did this, whoever is involved, and NASCAR is going to do their job and they're going to will find out who did it so they can have them removed.
KEILAR: So this is a big day today, right? Talladega rescheduled, we're expecting to see this at 3:00 P.M. today. This is one of the biggest races of the circuit. It is in the deep south. And I know that you were there at Talladega this weekend. And I want to show viewers something that I actually think you saw, you tweeted on the way to the speedway. Let's take a look at this.
You can see a lot of confederate flags there and there was as well we understand reports of confederate flags across from the speedway and one that said, Defund NASCAR. I wonder if you think that there are actually more flags since NASCAR banned confederate flags and confederate imagery and what message do you think that sends.
DANIELS: NASCAR banning the confederate flags from racing events was the biggest thing to have happen since the end of the civil war. Basically since NASCAR is a southern-based sport and they finally realized that they wanted to get rid of this negative symbol.
[13:20:02]
Because, NASCAR, we are all about togetherness and we don't need anything, you know, dividing us. And the flag was so much negative history behind it, that's just not what NASCAR is about.
And there are people who are very, very excited about the removal. Like I said, I'm all for the removal of the confederate flag at racing events. There are people who are really, really angry. But, hey, NASCAR had to deal with that flag around for many, many years and they decided to go with the route of going without, and there's nothing wrong with that. And like I said, I fully stand behind them with the removal.
More race fans wanted to join. I had a lot of people contact me, saying they're going to come to racing events now. And like I said, that was another big step for our sport going in the right direction.
KEILAR: Yes.
So one of the cool things about -- one of the things I think is cool about NASCAR anyway is that you actually see the pit crews and you can see the race car drivers up close if you get into the infield. And so you're actually -- I mean, fans can walk right by you while you're prepping for the race. And I wonder, having had sort of more exposure to fans and, say, other sports, have you experienced racism or discrimination since you joined the sport?
DANIELS: Hey, you already know it's hard being a black woman in NASCAR. And I have had my struggles, I have been through things, but, hey, I'm here in the sport for a reason. I'm here to make a change, make a difference, and NASCAR is my family, you know?
And I'm so behind them, supporting the Black Lives Matter Movement and just basically taking the necessary steps that we need in order to progress the sport and make it a better sport that welcomes all faces, not just one face.
So --
KEILAR: What's your message to Bubba Wallace here on this big day?
DANIELS: I would just tell Bubba to -- I mean, he know what it is for real.
KEILAR: We want to know.
DANIELS: Yes, we go through the same things. But, you know, just for Bubba, you need to be strong, you know? And us being the only few people of color in this sport, it's already tough and you have to be tough to be here. And we both have tough skin and I know he will be good. He's just using this as motivation to keep moving forward.
He just has to block this out because whoever was trying to intimidate him, they pretty much failed because it's not bothering him. He's still going to go out there do what he has to do, what he has to get done, and I'm fully behind him. I support him.
KEILAR: Brehanna Daniels, thank you so much for joining us from Charlotte.
DANIELS: Yes, thank you for having me.
KEILAR: New York is sparking another debate about statues over plans to remove the Roosevelt statue from the steps of the Museum of Natural History.
Also, new reporting on the president's reaction to the smaller than expected crowd at his rally and what Republican donors are saying behind the scenes.
After the powerful prosecutor who's investigating the president's inner circle refused to resign, the president fires him. So what happens to active cases he's been investigating? We'll have that next.
[13:25:00]
KEILAR: Calls for investigations into Attorney General Bill Barr growing louder after the late Friday night ouster of one of the most powerful prosecutors in the country, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York who has gone after President Trump's allies.
House Democrats are now inviting Geoffrey Berman to testify during a hearing on Capitol Hill Wednesday.
On Friday night, Barr suddenly announced that Berman have resigned his post. But shortly after that, Berman said, no, he had not resigned. His investigations would proceed unimpeded and he showed up to work on Saturday.
Barr then said the president was firing him, this as the president told reporters Saturday, no, he wasn't involved at all.
And just in, a source familiar says Berman refused to sign a DOJ letter that was criticizing New York's coronavirus restrictions that affect religious institutions. We were told that Barr was not aware of the dispute and it had nothing to do with his ouster.
I want to bring in Senator Mazie Hirono to talk with us about this. Senator, thank you so much for joining us from the Hill.
You were on the Judiciary Committee, which would confirm a replacement for Berman. What is your reaction to his firing?
SEN. MAZIE HIRONO (D-HI): I think it was totally politically motivated and this is because of the pattern of this kind of behavior from Attorney General Barr that he is very much the henchperson, henchman to Donald Trump.

The man, Holden James Matthews, 23, who burned down the churches over a 10-day period ending on April 4, 2019, was also ordered to pay nearly $2.7 million (£2.07m) to the churches. He pleaded guilty in federal court in February to three counts of violating the Church Arson Prevention Act and to one count of using fire to commit a felony.
Prosecutors did not mention race as a factor in the charges, but the church arsons evoked a long history of racist crimes committed across the Jim Crow South.
""These churches trace their origins to the post-Civil War Reconstruction period,"" Eric S. Dreiband, assistant attorney general of the civil rights division in the Justice Department, said in a statement on Monday. ""The churches survived for nearly 150 years but did not survive this defendant's warped act of hatred.""
At his sentencing in U.S. District Court in Lafayette, Louisiana, Matthews addressed congregants of the churches he had burned and apologised, according to The Acadiana Advocate of Lafayette.
""There are not enough words in the English language to say how sorry I am,"" the newspaper quoted Matthews as saying. ""If I could go back and change it, I would.""
The churches Matthews set ablaze were St. Mary Missionary Baptist Church in Port Barre, and Greater Union Baptist Church and Mount Pleasant Baptist Church, both in Opelousas.
At the sentencing, Judge Robert R. Summerhays of the Western District of Louisiana gave Matthews credit for the 18 months he has been in custody since his arrest in April 2019, about two weeks after the last church fire, The Advocate reported.
Matthews has also pleaded guilty to six state charges in connection with the church fires, including aggravated arson of a religious building and three hate crime counts. Sentencing is pending.
Matthews has admitted that he targeted the churches because of their religious character, according to prosecutors.
Matthews has also said that he was copying similar crimes committed in Norway in the 1990s in an effort to elevate his status among the black metal community, whose most extreme practitioners have engaged in church burning, vandalism and killings. Black metal is a subgenre of heavy metal, known for its unique blend of howls, nonsyncopated blast-beat drums and cold, trebly guitars.
Matthews posted pictures and videos of the church burnings on Facebook, and discussed them with a friend online, prosecutors said. In one message to a friend that prosecutors presented in court as evidence, Matthews mentioned a possible name for his would-be record label: ""Soul Rotting Records, 'music to burn to,' "" he wrote.
Dustin Charles Talbot, a lawyer for Matthews, did not immediately return a telephone call or email seeking comment Monday night. In February, Talbot said that Matthews had the social and mental development of an adolescent, and that his actions were not motivated by the racial makeup of the congregations.
""Holden now fully understands the seriousness and gravity of his actions and is deeply remorseful for what he has done and the pain he has caused the congregations of these churches,"" Talbot said.
Matthews' arrest came after investigators determined that his debit card was used to buy a gas can that was found at the scene of one of the fires.
In April, The Advocate reported that the three churches were in various stages of reconstruction. The land had been cleared at Mount Pleasant, and the church was awaiting an inspection to begin foundation work.
Donations to help rebuild the churches poured in last year, surpassing the organizers goal of $1.8 million.

Yet in the year he made that claim, there were 394 attacks and 56 murders. In 2019, there were 419 attacks and 56 murders. And in 2020 there have been some 200 attacks, and over 50 murders to date.
In June, the Democratic Alliance (DA) launched an awareness campaign and asked the President not only to retract that statement, but additionally to apologise to the men and women in our rural areas who are living in fear while still working 24/7 to feed our country.
Only now, today, because the flood of fury and anger has finally broken its banks, has President Ramaphosa been moved to respond. He referred to the murder of young Brendin Horner - who was horribly tortured to death. But failed to also include the hundreds of others who have been murdered since he claimed there were no farmers being murdered in our country.
He then said Brendin's killing ""should anger and upset every one of us"". What country does the President live in? It can't possibly be the one we live in - where farm murders are glorified? Where farmers are vilified on a daily basis?
Mr President, you are quite correct that the majority of victims of violent crimes are black and poor, but surely someone has told you that it is four times more dangerous to be on a farm than in any other area of South Africa?
We are already 26 years into our democracy, and only now does the President notice that we have a huge task to bring an end to murder, assault, robbery and rape? Is it that he has only recently noticed - despite our speaking out about these farm attacks for over 20 years? Did it take our concerted campaign that we began in June, to finally bring this to his attention?
Or did the fulminating signs of a potential civil war in response to these tortures and murders finally catch the President's attention?
The President's newsletter today is a case of too little, too late. Had he ever shown the slightest care for our farmers, farm workers, or their families - they may not today be so terribly at risk that they are leaving our country in droves. They are moving into the welcoming arms of many other countries - Malawi, Zambia, the USA, the UK and much of Europe - growing food for them, and no longer for us. Since 1994 we have dropped from 120 000 commercial farmers to 38 000.
And this weak newsletter with its hollow words is all the President can offer.
Those of us without bodyguards know what is going on. The whole country knew what a powder keg Senekal was. Yet somehow the President and the South African Police Service (SAPS) didn't notice until it was too late. Instead, in the face of murder after murder after murder, Ramaphosa spouts homilies.
South Africans do not need a lecture from the President. They want solutions. They want certainty that their President will ensure that these murders are declared Priority and Hate Crimes. They want to see funding go to the rural police stations so that farmers may actually sleep at night rather than patrol. They need the President's promise that there will be investigations when farmers report that police are in on the stock theft syndicates.
Instead, the President tells farming communities that private security must work with the SAPS. Sir, they already do.
The President should dismiss whoever it is advising him, and spend a few days speaking with those who live and work in terror on the ground.
Ramaphosa should retract his 2018 statement, apologise, and listen to our farmers - and in case his advisor hasn't told him, our farmers are white, black, coloured and Indian. And all of them are in terrible danger and need equal protection from the police."

The present study examines the prevalence and impact of victimization among a sample of Roma individuals in Malmö and Gothenburg (Sweden). The aim of the study was to examine the link between visibility and victimization, and whether the Roma community employs behavioural strategies to reduce visibility, and, finally, to analyse how such strategies affect the group. The study design combines survey data (n=610) with interviews (n=30). The findings suggest that visibility is an important risk factor for victimization and that the study participants’ attempt to conceal their ethnicity affects them negatively both at an individual and a community level. The discussion concludes by presenting a number of policy implications.
FULL TEXT
Introduction
This study describes the prevalence of victimization and its impact among a sample of the Roma minority in a Swedish context. In this study, the term ‘Roma’ is used as an umbrella term and refers to many ethnic minority groups that share a nomadic history, including the Roma, Travellers (in Swedish: Resandefolket), and others. It is estimated that there are up to 12 million Roma living in Europe and about 50,000 Roma living in Sweden (SOU, 2010: 55). Although this group cannot be defined as a single homogenous group, they face a number of shared challenges including exposure to discrimination and victimization.
In Sweden, the Roma have been subject to several officially recognized human rights violations during different ages (Westin et al., 2014). Furthermore, researchers have noted that the Roma constitute a vulnerable group in relation to victimization (Hall et al., 2014). Swedish official statistics estimate the number of anti-Roma-motivated hate crimes (or bias crimes) reported to the police in the year 2018 as approximately 160 cases, which is the lowest number of reported anti-Roma crimes since crimes with an anti-Roma motive started being registered as separate offences in the year 2008 (National Council for Crime Prevention [BRÅ], 2018). However, these official statistics are associated with several problems. There is a consensus among researchers with a focus on bias victimization that a significant amount of criminal activity is not officially recorded. In general, the Roma have a low propensity to report crimes to the police (Wallengren and Mellgren, 2018). It should also be noted that, in Sweden, there are no official data regarding the Roma community’s exposure to non-bias crimes, which makes it difficult to get a clear picture of the group’s victimization experiences. Few self-report studies concerning the Roma community’s victimization experiences have been conducted. According to one study by Wallengren and Mellgren (2015a), of a sample of 121 Roma living in the Gothenburg region of Sweden, 46% of the respondents reported having experienced at least one type of victimization during the last 12 months and one-fifth of the respondents had experienced anti-Roma-motivated victimization. As many as 84% stated that they had been the victims of an anti-Roma-motivated crime at some point during their lifetime. The study also found a tendency towards a higher degree of victimization among those respondents who were open about their ethnicity.
Even though researching a vulnerable population like the Roma presents numerous methodological challenges, there are many reasons for analysing the group’s victimization experiences. Firstly, the gathering of victimization data is essential in determining the extent of a group’s social problems and for the development of prevention strategies. Secondly, the vulnerable populations themselves may use such data to increase their empowerment, to point out their difficulties, and for lobbying, so that politicians (and others) are forced to acknowledge their experiences. Lastly, it is also possible that the research production in itself has a positive effect on the relationship between the majority society and the population. As often highlighted, the crimes that these vulnerable populations suffer are frequently perceived as a ‘message’– implying that the vulnerable populations are not full members of society and should ‘know their place’ (Perry, 2001). By producing research that highlights vulnerable populations’ suffering, society offers a counter message. It sends a signal that the specific group’s voices are of importance and that the group should be acknowledged as well as helped and protected.
The present study will contribute to this largely underexplored research field by reporting the victimization experiences of individuals who belong to the Roma minority in Malmö and Gothenburg, two of Sweden’s largest cities. A questionnaire was distributed and in-depth interviews were conducted to examine how visibility, i.e. the perception of the minority as being different from mainstream society, is related to victimization. In particular, we want to (a) investigate how visibility is related to the risk of victimization; (b) investigate whether study participants employ behavioural strategies to conceal group belonging as a means of reducing their victimization risk; and, finally, (c) analyse how these behavioural strategies affect the group.
Previous research and the study’s theoretical point of departure
Earlier research has shown that ethnic minority populations are significantly more likely to suffer from crime compared to non-minority populations. The most common way of explaining this pattern has been to draw inspiration from routine and lifestyle models (Cohen and Felson, 1979; Hindelang et al., 1978). According to this perspective, it is hypothesized that minority populations suffer from high rates of victimization as a consequence of living and working in high-risk environments, or that they suffer from crime as a consequence of being involved in norm-breaking activities themselves (Skogan and Maxfield, 1980). The criminal incidents to which the Roma are exposed may be explained by the group’s marginalized life situation. Research has shown that the Roma rank lower in many social indicators in comparison to non-Roma individuals in Sweden (SOU, 2010; 55). However, no empirical study has tested whether the Roma community’s marginalization can explain their crime exposure. Furthermore, as has been noted by several researchers, the most distinguishing feature of vulnerable populations’ victimization is that they are at risk of suffering from bias-motivated victimization and, thus, of being targeted by offenders based on their group identity (Perry, 2001).
Before a minority community can be targeted, they must first be made ‘visible’ and set outside the societal norm (Perry, 2015). Most theories that have sought to explain how negative attitudes develop towards different marginalized groups argue that it starts by a process through which an ‘Us’ and a ‘Them’ are constructed based on group identities. Several theoretical models have been developed that emphasize different social mechanisms that are believed to create these negative attitudes; most importantly, if the primary threat posed by the minority is viewed to be cultural or economic, there are several theoretical overlaps between them (Plous, 2003). The current dominant theory for explaining bias incidents is that of Barbara Perry (2001), who argues that bias crime is an act of violence and intimidation, usually directed towards already stigmatized groups and carried out to keep individuals down in a social hierarchy. Those who do not resemble the norm of an ‘Us’ come to represent an ‘Other’ that is less valued, at best, and directly stigmatized through various forms of discriminatory practices such as bias crime, at worst (Perry, 2001). This perspective is suitable for analysing the Roma since the group has a long history of being set apart from society (Selling, 2013; Westin et al., 2014). Chakraborti and Garland (2012), however, have criticized Perry (2001), arguing that the interpretation of bias crime as structural leads us to overlook its situational causes. They acknowledge that norms govern behaviour and occasionally give rise to bias incidents. However, they also present other factors that can cause prejudiced behaviour on a situational basis, including the interpretation of the victim as a vulnerable and easy target. Current empirical evidence gives support for bias crimes being driven both by cultural tensions and by lifestyle-related factors (Van Kesteren, 2016). This indicates the importance of analysing victimization on the basis of both social and contextual factors.
Thus, according to current theory development, a minority group’s visibility should constitute a risk factor for victimization. Some argue that this pattern is rooted in social power structures and that bias incidents serve both a symbolic and an instrumental function in controlling stigmatized populations (Goffman, 1963; Perry, 2001, 2015), while others argue that the pattern may be explained by the fact that a minority population’s visibility is related to the offenders’ ability to exploit their vulnerability (Chakraborti and Garland, 2012). It should be noted that it is not only physical visibility that is of importance. According to Goffman (1963), stigma becomes visible through the presence of what he calls ‘stigma symbols’, which may be linked to both physical appearance and behaviour.
Earlier studies have indeed noted that the visibility of minority groups is a risk factor for bias victimization. A study by Chongatera (2013), who studied racially visible minority populations in Canada, found that while higher income minimized the likelihood of exposure to bias victimization to some extent, visible race status appeared to be the major and independent determinant of the likelihood of experiencing such incidents. Studies have also focused on the fact that other aspects of visibility, such as whether individuals employ various symbols that signal group belonging, whether individuals practice their culture openly, or whether they have surnames that are perceived as non-normative, also increase the risk of exposure to bias incidents (Khosravi, 2012; Perry, 2015; Tiby, 2001; Wallengren and Mellgren, 2015a; Wigerfelt et al., 2014). Existing studies have shown that one of the most common strategies employed by potential bias victims is to reduce their victimization risk by applying behavioural strategies that reduce their visibility. Commonly used strategies include hiding one’s background, avoiding symbols that may signal group belonging, changing one’s names, trying to speak without an accent, and attempting to avoid contexts that are perceived to be particularly risky (Ford et al., 2012; Rai and Hesse, 1992; Wallengren and Mellgren, 2015a; Wigerfelt and Wigerfelt, 2015a). The use of these strategies implies that potential bias victims come to regard their visibility as a risk factor for victimization.
However, it should be noted that there appears to be some variation between different groups concerning the behavioural strategies employed. The strategy of concealing one’s identity seems to be primarily used by those who are able to hide significant identity markers. For example, the strategy of concealing group belonging has been reported in the Jewish community (Wigerfelt and Wigerfelt, 2015b) but not in the African-Swedish community (Wigerfelt et al., 2014). As regards the Roma, it is possible that different Roma can manipulate these markers in different ways. Two studies by Wallengren and Mellgren (2015a; 2018) provide indications that this is, in fact, the case. The first study examined the experiences of a bias crime in the Swedish Roma community. The second study examined experiences of victimization among EU migrants who support themselves by begging. While members of the Swedish Roma community were able to conceal their identity and did so frequently, the EU migrants did not perceive this as an option due to the necessity of being visible in public settings when they were engaged in begging. This study will contribute to and enlarge the research field by analysing how visibility is related to Roma victimization and victimization consequences in more detail.
Methods and data
The study of victimization concerning a vulnerable research population raises many methodological and ethical difficulties. A fundamental challenge when it comes to the Roma, in a Swedish context, is that we lack information about the size of the community, where they live and other related demographic characteristics. It is also a fact that many Roma are actively hiding their ethnicity from the non-Roma community (Wallengren and Mellgren, 2015a, 2015b, 2018). The lack of ethnic-based registration data and the group’s tendency to conceal their group belonging means that it is in practice impossible to gather a generalizable sample of the community.
To gain access to the field, many researchers have argued for the importance of including representatives from the study population in the research process (Kósa et al., 2007). A commonly used sampling strategy has been to contact members of such populations through their interest associations. However, samples obtained in this way are in many ways problematic (Wallengren and Mellgren, 2015b). In the planning phase of this study, Roma organizations were contacted, but few of these showed an interest in collaborating with the research team, and, ultimately, no organization helped with the data collection. Instead, we had to use other strategies to get access to potential study participants. Within this project, one of the authors (SW) belonged to the Roma minority and earlier had a role as a Roma spokesperson. For this reason, previously established contacts with individual Roma could be used to reach potential study participants. Through these contacts, 22 gatekeepers were contacted, of whom 16 were recruited. These gatekeepers were thus not attached to any particular Roma organization per se but could be described as ‘ordinary’ Roma with an interest in participating in the study. The gatekeepers did not receive any form of payment for participating in the study, or during the data gathering, other than being helped with regard to different costs related to their expenses. The data collection involved a two-phase process of both the distribution of a questionnaire and in-depth interviews.
Questionnaire
During the first phase, the research team wanted to distribute a victimization questionnaire to Roma living in Gothenburg and Malmö. The questionnaire was constructed based on earlier measurements commonly used in victimization surveys (Andersson, 2018). However, in view of earlier research on measurements that can be perceived as ‘too sensitive’ and possibly stigmatizing within the Roma community (Wallengren and Mellgren, 2015b), and after discussions with the study’s gatekeepers, it was concluded that some questions were not suitable to include in the questionnaire. This concerned questions related to the respondents’ socio-economic status, their living situation/geographical location, and their own criminal activities, as well as questions related to especially vulnerable subpopulations (e.g., questions to do with women’s victimization and that of the HBTQ individuals). Thus, such questions were excluded from the questionnaire and this has undoubtedly affected the study’s validity. However, it also made participants more willing to participate in the study and potentially increased their feelings of safety and security.
The anonymity requirement has been highly prioritized in this study. An advantage of this study’s approach of first contacting gatekeepers, who then distributed questionnaires to Roma respondents, means that no one, not even the research team, can find out who has responded to the questionnaire. The gatekeepers received a number of questionnaires in unsealed envelopes. They were instructed to give the questionnaires to individuals whom they considered suitable for the study. The only inclusion criterion was that the study participant should self-identify with the juridical umbrella term Roma, be living in either Gothenburg or Malmö, and be over the age of 16. It should be acknowledged that this approach gave the gatekeepers considerable influence both on the selection process and in the treatment of the study population (Bound, 2012). It was therefore important for us to point out to the gatekeepers that they should draw attention to the purpose of the study, that participation in the study was voluntary, and that the questionnaire should be answered anonymously. To ensure that the gatekeepers did not commit any ethical violations, the questionnaire also contained a formal letter of information about the study and contact details for the research team. In discussions with the data collectors, it was concluded that it would be difficult to translate the questionnaire into Romani chib. The reason for this is that Romani chib is a language but also to a large extent consists of different dialects that differ from each other too much for Romani chib to be used in surveys. The fact that many Swedish Roma lack language skills (SOU, 2010: 55) was also seen as a problem in using Romani chib in the questionnaire. Instead, the questionnaire was conducted in Swedish. The distribution of questionnaires took place between January 2015 and October 2016. The respondents were given two options for returning the questionnaires: either to return them to the person who had distributed them or to send them by mail to the research group in prepaid envelopes. In total, 750 questionnaires were distributed, of which 610 were completed, giving a response rate of 80%, which is high in comparison to earlier studies (Andersson, 2018: Tiby, 2001). During the data collection, some respondents phoned to verify the identity of the researcher and were not willing to complete the survey until the researcher’s identity as a Roma had been established. This shows the benefits of involving members of the community in the research process.
Measures
The background variables included in the questionnaire are: Gender (0=male, 1=female); Residence (0=Malmo, 1=Goteborg); Age (0=16–19 years, 1= 20–29 years, 2= 30–39 years, 3= 40–49 years, 4 = over 50 years of age); Housing type (0=privately owned apartment, 1= house, 2= rented apartment); and Subgroup membership (0=Traveller, 1= Swedish Roma, 2= Finnish Roma, 3= Non-European Roma, 4= Newly arrived Roma).
Regarding victimization, we asked respondents: ‘Have you experienced any type of crime during the last 12 months?’ (Answer categories, if yes, were: threats, harassment, or bullying [either verbal or written], minor assault and aggravated assault, robbery, burglary and discrimination.) The respondent could answer no (=0) and yes (=1). With regard to bias victimization, we asked respondents in a follow-up question if the incident they had suffered during the last 12 months was founded on hostility towards or prejudice against their ethnic background. The respondent could answer no (=0) and yes (=1). In a series of follow-up questions, respondents were asked to state how many times they had been victimized (‘Give a number’), where the victimization occurred (‘Name a place in free text’), and what their relationship with the perpetrator was. Response alternatives for the relationship with the offender were: friend, acquaintance, stranger, partner or ex-partner, family member or resident in the local area. The questions used allow for a wide range of behaviours that the respondent could interpret as a bias crime. The legal definition of bias crime (or hate crime) in a Swedish context can be found in two legal sections and one penalty enhancement rule. The first is unlawful discrimination (Chapter 16, Section 9 of the Swedish Penal Code), and the second is incitement to hatred (Chapter 16, Section 8 of the Swedish Penal Code). The crimes not covered by these sections are included under the sentencing enhancement rule, introduced in 1994 (Chapter 29, Section 2, paragraph 7 of the Swedish Penal Code). According to this law (Law, 1994: 306), when a motive for crime is to aggrieve a person, ethnic group or some other similar group of people, by reason of race, colour, national or ethnic origin, religious belief or other similar circumstances, this should be considered an aggravating circumstance when assessing the seriousness of the act. The legal definition thus includes the definition of bias crime applied in this study, but this study has a victim perspective, which means that it is the victim’s perception of the act that defines whether or not it was bias-motivated.
To investigate the role played by visibility in relation to victimization, three questions about visibility were included in the survey. The first was ‘Do you wear symbols or clothing that are associated with your background?’ Secondly, we included the question if the respondents actively try to hide their ethnicity: ‘Do you actively try to hide your background?’ (Answer categories: 0=Never, 1=Rarely, 2=Sometimes, 3=Always). Lastly, to obtain a more specific understanding of whether the respondents are perceived by others as Roma, we added a question: ‘Do you believe that most other people perceive you as you described your background?’ (Answer categories: 0=No, nobody, 1=A few people, 2=Yes, most people, 3=Yes, everyone).
Sample characteristics
The characteristics of the questionnaire respondents are briefly presented in Table 1. As we can see, the gender distribution was relatively even in the sample as a whole: women=313, men =297. It is not possible to compare the sample characteristics to the general Roma population since there is no ethnic registration in Sweden. However, when comparing the respondent’s characteristics with the general Swedish population it is clear that the respondents of this survey were significantly younger than the general Swedish population and to a lesser extent owned their housing (SCB, 2019). It is also clear that the sample contains an overrepresentation of the Roma subpopulation ‘Travellers’. According to estimates, it is believed that about half of the Roma in Sweden belong to the Traveller community (SOU, 2010: 55).

Interviews
In the second phase of the data collection, those who had participated in the questionnaire survey were asked whether they would agree to participate in interviews. Within the project as a whole, 52 individuals who had participated in the questionnaire survey contacted the research team. Subsequently, a selection of study participants was made, where the research group had the objective of obtaining a variety of individuals regarding Roma subgroup belonging, age and gender. In the end, 30 Roma individuals were interviewed. Before the interviews took place, the research team asked the study participants if they found the quantitative phase, and the interaction between themselves and the gatekeepers, satisfactory, and they were once again informed about the purpose of the study. Study participants signed a written consent form before any recording began. All interviews were recorded and then transcribed. The study participants were given a choice to be interviewed by another Roma individual (SW) or by a female non-Roma member of the research team (no one chose the latter). The interviews took place at a location of the study participants’ choosing, most of them in the study participants’ homes, but some at Malmö University. The majority of the interviews were conducted in Swedish, but some were conducted with elements of Romani chib mixed in with Swedish. The interviewed study participants are briefly presented in Table 2. Their names and ages have been changed to ensure their anonymity.

All of the interviewed study participants had at some time been exposed to a bias crime based on their ethnic background. The goal was that the interviews should be conducted individually. However, some study participants preferred for the interviews to be conducted as group interviews. This included Rosa and Peter, who were close friends since childhood; Hans and Ellinor, who were a married couple; Isabell and her daughter Tove; and Jan and his son Charles.
Analytical strategy
The following analytical strategy was employed to answer the study’s questions.
As a first step, we began with a descriptive analysis of the prevalence of victimization in the survey sample. In the second step, we conducted six binary logistic regression analyses in order to analyse how visibility is related to bias and non-bias victimization. We also included gender and age as control variables. Based on earlier theoretical frameworks, we hypothesize that visibility will be significantly related to bias but not non-bias victimization (see e.g. Chakraborti and Garland, 2012; Perry, 2001). In the third step, once the qualitative data had been collected these were analysed using thematic analysis (Braun and Clarke, 2006), in which we sought themes or patterns of relationships between key concepts. We focused on themes and patterns related to visibility and victimization. The analysis was conducted in five steps: (a) initial read-through of the material; (b) additional reading with a focus on recurring themes; (c) initial categorization of themes; (d) further processing of the themes; and (e) final categorization. Thematic development occurred in an inductive or ‘bottom-up’ manner, which means that the themes identified are strongly linked to the data themselves.
Results
Of the 610 respondents in the survey, 221 (36%) reported having experienced at least one form of victimization during the last 12 months, which could be compared to approximately one-fifth of the Swedish population as a whole (National Council for Crime Prevention [BRÅ], 2018) and 46% of respondents in Wallengren and Mellgren’s (2015a) pilot study of Roma living in the Gothenburg region of Sweden. Among the respondents, 23% reported that they had been exposed to more than one crime during the previous 12-month period. The most common types of crime that the respondents reported having experienced were discrimination (30.1%) and threats, bullying or harassment either verbally (25.2%) or over the internet (11.8%). The least common forms of victimization reported by the respondents were minor or aggravated assault (3.7% and 3.3% respectively). The majority of the crimes that the respondents reported having experienced over the last 12 months were perceived as racial bias crimes (52%) and, more specifically, crimes with an anti-Roma motive.
Men reported significantly higher exposure for both non-bias crimes (19.9%) and bias-motivated crime (23.9%) compared to women (approximately 10% of women reported non-bias victimization and 19.2% reported bias victimization). With regard to age, younger respondents were more likely to report being victimized; 52% of the respondents in the age group 16–29 years old reported victimization compared to 14.1% of respondents over the age of 40. Younger respondents also reported significantly higher bias victimization compared to older respondents (34.1% versus 6.6%). In a majority of the cases (approximately 70%), the perpetrator was a person known to the victim. In about 20% of the cases, the perpetrator was a member of the victim’s own ethnic community. The most commonly reported place of incident was the respondent’s living area, where more than half of the criminal incidents had occurred.
Some 55% of the respondents stated that they at least sometimes concealed their ethnicity. There were small but notable differences between individuals who never or sometimes concealed their ethnicity compared to respondents who most of the time or always concealed their ethnicity (37.4% of the first group reported victimization compared to 33.1% of the latter). Regarding bias victimization, 26.3% of individuals who never or sometimes concealed their ethnicity reported bias victimization compared to 9% of respondents who most of the time or always concealed their ethnicity. Respondents who tended to use cultural symbols reported significantly more victimization compared to respondents who seldom or never used such symbols (16.9% compared to 54.8%). With regard to perceptional visibility, 31.9% of respondents who reported that none or few individuals perceive them as Roma had been victimized compared to 34.3% of respondents who believed that most or everyone perceived them as Roma.
Visibility and victimization
The main purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between visibility and victimization. As we have seen, at the descriptive level, the results seem to support that visibility is related to bias victimization. To discover whether visibility has a more independent effect on victimization, binary logistic regression analyses were conducted for three types of visibility: symbolic visibility, perceptional visibility and concealment of ethnicity (the concealment of ethnicity scale have been turned). Gender and age were used in all analyses as background variables. As the predicted variable, we used victimization during the last 12-month period, both with and without bias motive. The result can be seen in Table 3.

As we can see from the analysis, we found a negative relationship between perceptional visibility and non-bias victimization but a positive relationship between perceptional visibility and experiencing bias victimization (for each unit’s increase in perceptional visibility, the odds are 0.27 times less to be exposed to non-bias victimization but an increase of 2.3 with regard to bias victimization). With regard to non-bias victimization, we also found a significant relationship with gender, where men were more likely to report victimization than women (the risk is about 0.57 lower for females). We also found age to have a negative relationship with reporting non-bias victimization (for each unit’s increase in age the risk was 0.20 times lower). Also with regard to reporting bias victimization, we found a significant relationship with gender, where men were more likely to report bias victimization than women (the risk is about 0.36 lower for females) and that age has a negative relationship with reporting bias victimization (for each unit’s increase in age we found the risk was about 0.60 times lower).
With regards to symbolic visibility, we found a negative relationship with non-bias victimization and a positive relationship with bias victimization (for each unit’s increase in symbolic visibility, the odds are 0.3 times lower to be exposed to non-bias victimization but increases by 1.85 with regard to bias victimization). Women were found to be significantly less likely to report non-bias victimization compared to men (with an odds of 0.6 times lower risk) and with regard to bias victimization we did not find a significant relationship. Age was significantly related to both bias (for each unit’s increase in age the risk was 0.45 times smaller) and non-bias victimization (0.27 times lower) with older respondents being less likely to report victimization.
With regard to concealment of ethnicity, we found a significant relationship between both bias and non-bias victimization (for each unit’s increase in concealment (i.e. increased visibility) the odds of reporting bias victimization increases 1.5 times while the odds decreases by 0.34 times for non-bias victimization). Regarding non-bias victimization, we found a significant relationship with gender, where women were less likely to report non-bias victimization compared to men (odds for women were 0.6 times lower) but for bias victimization we did not find a significant relationship with regard to gender. Furthermore, we found a negative association with age, where older respondents were less likely to report both non-bias victimization (for each unit’s increase in age the risk was 0.25 times smaller) and for bias victimization (the risk was 0.5 times smaller).
To summarize, the analysis shows that there is a relationship between visibility and bias victimization. This pattern is in line with theoretical frameworks that predict that ‘visibility’ should be related to experiencing bias-motivated crimes. The next section will deal with the qualitative data material.
Thematic analysis of interviews
The analysis of the interviews resulted in three overarching themes: (a) Roma visibility and vulnerability; (b) strategies to conceal visibility; and (c) resulting individual and community effects.
Roma visibility and vulnerability
All of the interviewed study participants claimed that the Roma are a vulnerable group with respect to victimization. Of the 30 study participants, 12 emphasized the group’s social disadvantage in the explanation of the group’s victimization risk. These study participants proposed that one reason that the Roma are more likely than non-Roma to be victimized is that they live in high-risk neighbourhoods and often lead marginalized lives where, for example, the prevalence of alcohol and drug usage is high. These study participants argue that the group’s socio-economic vulnerability makes it difficult for them to protect themselves from crime. However, Peter and Rosa argued that this is not true for the younger Roma, who are much better integrated into Swedish society than the older generation.
All of the study participants agreed that the main reason that the Roma are at risk of victimization is the majority society’s negative attitudes towards the group. Thus, the study participants did highlight that visibility is an important risk factor for explaining their victimization. However, even though some Roma subpopulations are claimed to be more vulnerable due to their physical appearance, all of the study participants except Vincent and Isabell pointed out that it is not physical appearance that is the main form of visibility risk factor. Instead, the study participants discuss a border form of visibility, in the sense that people in the individuals’ surroundings know about the study participants’ ethnic background through information about their family background.
Thus, the study participants appear to support the view that social disadvantage and ethnicity are both factors that increase the group’s overall vulnerability and victimization risk. In practice, however, it is argued that the aforementioned vulnerabilities are not entirely different from one another. The study participants claimed that different Roma families and individuals have different opportunities to conceal their ethnicity in different settings. Felicia, Diana and Vincent argued that it is harder for individuals living in communities characterized by an ethnically heterogeneous population to hide their ethnicity, due to an interest that people in such communities have in knowing what heritage a specific individual or family has.
Strategies to conceal visibility and combat victimization risk
At the time of the interview, all of the interviewed study participants reported using strategies, or having used strategies, to minimize their visibility and thus the risk of victimization. Commonly used strategies include hiding one’s background, changing one’s names and avoiding non-Roma contexts. The strategies resorted to vary across the individual’s life course.
Some of the interviewed study participants told us during our discussions that it was common for their families to try to hide their ethnicity in quite drastic ways. Some of the study participants even claimed that it had until recently been common for them to conceal their ethnicity from partners, family members or even their children. Rosa told us that she had tried to hide her ethnicity more or less throughout her entire lifespan. ‘I didn’t tell anyone that I was a tattare [authors’ note: ‘tattare’=a degrading term often used towards the Travellers]. Not my two husbands and not my children.’ Out of 30 study participants, 11 also told us that it is taboo for them to openly identify themselves as members of the community to outsiders, particularly if there is a risk that this might affect other community members. Furthermore, some of these study participants argued that if they are too open with their ethnicity to outsiders, there is a risk that other community and family members may stop associating with them, or even threaten and harass them.
However, nine of the study participants argued that although it is indeed common that some members of their community do hide their ethnicity in this way, individuals might lose their status within their community if they are perceived to be concealing their group identity too much from non-Roma. These study participants instead told us that they hide their ethnicity while applying for jobs or housing, and from neighbours or classmates, but not from family members.
In line with our conclusion in the earlier section, the study participants claimed that in certain instances it is not practical, nor always possible, to hide their ethnicity. In these circumstances, participants use other strategies to protect themselves. Most notably, study participants claimed that they scan new contexts for signs of risk and potential offenders. These study participants described a heightened awareness and increased suspicion. They described how they would ‘lie low’ but pay attention to how non-Roma talk, and particularly whether they make intolerant statements about different groups. Some study participants also claimed that they use more proactive behaviours to identify possible offenders, such as denigrating different racial groups (for instance, their own) and then reading the response.
Individual negative consequences of concealing group belonging
Researchers have observed that individuals who conceal their identity often perceive this strategy to be something of a double-edged sword (Meyer, 2003). Concealing one’s identity can provide a sense of security. However, in certain situations, it can also cause anxiety and fear. In this study, there were participants who told us that concealing their group belonging was relatively unproblematic. Concealing their Roma heritage in certain situations and contexts is something which the group, as David told us, ‘simply does’. According to these participants, the concealment strategy makes them feel safer or at least makes it possible for them to relax. They do not have to prepare themselves to discuss, explain or protect aspects of their ethnicity to non-Roma individuals.
At the same time, there were participants who told us that the concealment strategy was both ineffective and problematic in several ways. Firstly, hiding their identity makes many of the study participants feel dehumanized and ashamed. Furthermore, the participants do not trust their ability to conceal their ethnicity effectively. They told us that they feel that they always need to be on the alert and to make sure that they (or others) do not do or say anything that might make people aware of their group belonging. Secondly, by comparison with individuals who are open about their ethnicity, individuals who belong to a stigmatized community, and are successful in concealing it, may encounter situations in which they are forced to listen to ridicule and resentment focused on their community, from individuals whom they would probably not encounter if they were open about their identity. In this study, eight study participants testified that they had encountered situations in which individuals have talked negatively about ‘beggars’, ‘gypsies’ or ‘tinkers’ without knowing that the participants identified themselves with the ridiculed group. Thirdly, the study participants may not know exactly how others will react if they reveal their identity, or indeed if individuals in their surroundings already know about their group belonging. Individuals who are successful in concealing their identity do not experience being ‘challenged’ in their view that people in their surroundings may not have negative attitudes about their group. Five out of the 30 interviewed study participants told us different ‘coming-out’ stories and that they were sometimes surprised that loved ones did not care about their ethnic background or see it as something negative.
Empirical studies have shown that victims of bias crime are at risk of developing different forms of negative emotional, psychological and health outcomes as a consequence of their victimization (Iganski, 2008; Iganski and Lagou, 2015; Lehavot and Simoni, 2011; Mellgren et al., 2017). In this study, the participants often described how they had developed various problems as a consequence of living with a stigmatized identity and trying to combat this by using the strategy of concealment. There were participants who told us that they had become paranoid and that they had always lived with an intrusive feeling of being ‘looked down upon’ by other people. As a result, they described not trusting other individuals and said that they had developed an aggressive way of solving conflicts and that they had problems investing in social relationships. Some also said that they believed that it is common that individuals from their community who have these feelings are at risk of using drugs and alcohol to combat their anxiety, feelings of inferiority, self-hatred and isolation. Of the 30 study participants, 10 told us that they believed that they needed professional help to solve some of their psychological problems. As a final note, nine of the 30 study participants claimed that the feelings of stigma had affected their ability both to participate in Swedish society and to invest in their future. These study participants expressed a loss of self-esteem and human value and described having a hard time imagining who they would be and what their lives would be like in the absence of these behavioural changes, adaptations and feelings of inferiority.
Community consequences of concealing group belonging
It is clear from the study participants’ testimonies that strategies of concealment hurt the Roma community at large. These effects seem to cause frictions between members of the community, but they also, as we will see, seem to have had an impact on the Roma culture, both with respect to its expressions and in relation to individuals’ ability to participate in their culture and develop their cultural identity.
Study participants told us that they had employed strategies of concealment since childhood and that these strategies were taught to them by their parents. There was a number, particularly among the younger participants, who told us that they do not think that the concealment strategy should be used by the younger generations, because it is ineffective and also destructive. At the same time, most of the study participants have children, and it was common for them to express worry about their children’s safety and to question whether or not their children should hide their ethnicity. Maja, who was pregnant with her first child at the time of the interview, told us: I’m so happy, but it’s also strange. My husband and I are already thinking about my girl’s future. Should I encourage her to tell people about her background while she is a child, or should I tell her to hide it until she is older and can stand up for herself? In this study, both older and younger participants told us that they believe that there is a social mechanism present in their community whereby Roma children are, to some extent, socialized to anticipate stigma. Eight of the study participants discussed how they, as children or teenagers, had parents who often had an intolerant attitude to drinking, how their parents sometimes controlled who their children were allowed to meet, how they were told to be home early in the evenings, and, most importantly, how they were told not to tell people about their background. Most of these participants described this as an overly protective upbringing, even though it was well-intentioned, and also as somewhat problematic. In certain cases, they also reported having experienced feelings of isolation within their community as a result.
Some of the study participants told us that their parents did not tell them about their ethnicity until they were older. In other cases, families had been open about their family background but had remained secretive about their culture and were opposed to their children learning certain aspects of their culture, such as the language. The study participants who were raised in an environment in which the culture was ‘hidden’ sometimes expressed anger over the fact that they had lost some aspects of their culture or that they did not have the ability to gain or develop a ‘Roma identity’. In a group interview with Charlotte and her daughter Tove, Tove told us: I feel lost in all of this, and I don’t know who to blame. It’s frustrating; I haven’t been raised in the culture, not truly. There were also those who claimed that it is problematic that individuals who belong to the community try to hide their ethnicity and culture in more general terms. Morgan, for example, argued that one consequence of this concealment is that younger individuals have lost their culture and identity as Roma. During our discussion, he told us that: It isn’t good when they try to hide it. They stop speaking our language and then they are not Roma anymore. Thus, the fact that the group uses the strategy of concealment to a varying degree seems to have a profound effect on both individuals’ ability to practise their culture and their feelings of cultural identity.
As was noted earlier, some of the study participants told us that there is a taboo about being open with their ethnicity to outsiders. Some participants explained that this is a consequence of the fact that a ‘silent culture’ has developed in some of the Roma communities as a result of stigmatization. According to some, individuals who do not uphold this ‘agreement’ to keep the Roma culture protected from outsiders may be punished. Some individuals who participated in this study had been activists for Roma issues, and they stated that it was relatively common for them to have been discriminated against by other Roma, as many Roma do not want their culture to be shown to outsiders. These study participants argued that they did not engage in politics, because they believed that they would be discriminated against both by other Roma and by members of the majority society. One study participant, Morgan, criticized those who engage in the public debate relating to ‘Roma issues’: I find it immoral to go out and talk about our culture and problems with outsiders. They put us all at risk. We have never needed the government to help us keep our language or identity. It’s better that we keep quiet as we always have done.
Discussion
A liberal democratic society must guarantee individuals both safety and the opportunity to express, practise and develop their cultural, sexual or religious identity in the public sphere. This study has described the prevalence and impact of victimization among a sample of the Roma minority in Sweden. The results of this study contribute to our collective knowledge of the Roma community’s vulnerability to victimization. In this study, 36% of the respondents reported having experienced at least one form of victimization during the last 12 months and about half of these incidents (52%) were perceived as racial bias crimes committed with an anti-Roma motive. In the majority of cases, the crimes reported by the respondents were different forms of discrimination and verbal forms of harassment. Compared to the general Swedish population, the prevalence of the respondents’ victimization is high. However, the results of this study are in line with previous studies concerning the victimization experiences of Swedish Roma (Wallengren and Mellgren, 2015a), indicating that the group indeed is vulnerable to victimization and highlighting the importance of conducting self-report studies regarding the group’s victimization experiences.
One way of summarizing the study’s results would be that the degree of visibility and the expression of cultural manifestations that an individual carries with her seem to play an important role in shaping individuals’ victimization exposure risk, lives and opportunities. In line with current theoretical developments, we hypothesized that visibility would be related to bias victimization (Chakraborti and Garland, 2012; Goffman, 1963; Perry, 2015). We did find a positive relationship between our measurements of visibility and bias victimization (taking gender and age into account). However, based on this study’s data, it is not possible to determine whether visibility is an independent risk factor for experiencing bias victimization. It is possible that people who are more visible have different routine activities and encounter more risky situations than individuals who are less visible (Cohen and Felson, 1979; Hindelang et al., 1978; Wallengren and Mellgren, 2015a). As both the study’s survey respondents and interviewed study participants stated that they mainly were victimized in their living area, this could indicate that lifestyle-related variables indeed are of importance. A further explanation of the differences in levels of victimization between the visible and the less visible respondents may be that the more visible are more aware of (or sensitive to) perceiving different acts as bias-motivated, while less visible individuals do not. In the study’s qualitative data, it was argued that the main visibility risk factor is others knowing about the respondent’s ethnicity, not the group’s physical appearance. This corresponds well with the quantitative analysis where ‘perceptional visibility’ was found to be the strongest factor associated with bias victimization in comparison to ‘symbolic visibility’ and the strategy of concealment. The reason that physical visibility, according to the study participants, is not associated with victimization might be that non-Roma lack knowledge of the Roma community’s symbols, that the group’s physical appearance is not notably different from that of mainstream society, and also that individuals who belong to the Roma community are concealing their ethnicity.
This study also points to the problems of living with a stigmatized identity. A strikingly high proportion of the respondents in this study (55%) reported that they chose to conceal their ethnicity due to fear of victimization. Some of the study participants did not view this as problematic. Others, however, believed that the strategy had caused several forms of harm. In line with previous research, the study participants argued that, at the individual level, concealment caused feelings of dehumanization, shame, self-hatred, inferiority, fear and anxiety, and produced a lack of trust (Goffman, 1963). In addition to these individual-level effects, however, this study highlights the negative community effects of concealment. The study participants argued that the concealment strategy had in some cases limited individuals’ access to their cultural identity and that some individuals felt isolated in their communities. This study’s results also support the assumption that victimization and stigmatization have a disempowering effect on vulnerable populations and limit their ability to improve their societal position (Goffman, 1963). Several study participants argued that their stigmatization had affected their ability to live the life they would have wanted. Actual and perceived victimization directed towards marginalized communities could thus be viewed as a democratic problem that intensifies inequalities between different populations.
A number of limitations associated with the study must be acknowledged. First of all, since we lack population-level data on the Roma in Sweden, it is not possible to draw a random sample of the Roma population and thus generalize results. A subpopulation of Roma, the Travellers, were overrepresented in the current sample. Approximately 70% of the sample consisted of this subgroup, which is estimated to be about half of the Roma population in Sweden. This group is often believed to have a stronger socio-economic status compared to other Roma subpopulations (SOU, 2010: 55), limiting the validity of the study. Another limitation was that, for ethical reasons, we were unable to include background variables in the analysis related to the respondents’ lifestyles. In addition, the following two political developments occurred in Sweden during the planning phase of the study, which strongly prevented us including some of these background variables. One incident was the growing support for the populist party the Swedish Democrats (Sverigedemokraterna) and the polarizing debate that surrounded their growing support that scared many Roma living in Sweden at the time. The second incident contributing to the group’s unwillingness to respond to such variables was that the Swedish police in the autumn of 2013 had an illegal database of Roma consisting of 4000 individuals. It is likely that this incident has heavily damaged the Roma community’s trust in the authorities (Wigerfelt and Wigerfelt, 2015a) and by extension the research community. Finally, visibility is a somewhat problematic measure. The meaning of visibility is dependent on different individuals’ knowledge and perceptions, and it may vary between different historical periods and contexts. Our measurements for visibility are also, in reality, overlapping with one another and with behavioural strategies often used by victims of crime to minimize the risk of being exposed to victimization. However, we do believe that our use of a mixed approach made it possible to overcome some of these limitations. The methodological choice of using a mixed methodology approach enabled the participants to reflect on and explain various difficult concepts relating to their victimization experiences and consequences of victimization. It also enabled the research team to capture the study participants’ experiences and perceptions of different forms of social problems that were perceived as too sensitive to gather during the quantitative phase of the study. We would argue that our use of a mixed methodology approach, allowing the survey and interview data to inform one another, strengthens the study’s validity and provides us with a deeper understanding of the group’s experiences and the relationship between visibility and victimization.
Further research and policy implications
The study’s finding that the Roma are experiencing a high prevalence of victimization, and that visibility seems to be an important risk factor in explaining this pattern, calls for action. We do not claim that the current study provides any significant answers to many of the difficult questions facing those who are interested in developing policies to support vulnerable populations in relation to victimization. However, we would argue that some implications might be drawn from the study’s results.
Firstly, we believe that members of the Roma community may be experiencing problems associated with the acknowledgment of their Roma identity. The so-called Roma have a shifting view of their ethnicity, and some are critical of the use of the Roma label. This is problematic. It is possible that such individuals will not seek support or help if their self-proclaimed identity is not acknowledged. It is also possible that different forms of messages from mainstream society that are intended to show support towards the ‘Roma’ may have the opposite effect on those individuals who do not identify with the community. It is important that Swedish society develops an understanding of the complexities of the inner lives of those living in this community and respects their self-proclaimed identities. Also, we would argue that the study highlights a number of criticisms that may be directed at the hypothesis that bias victimization is more damaging than non-bias victimization due to the fact that bias incidents are intended to damage the victim’s ‘self’ (Iganski, 2008; Perry, 2001). As has been highlighted by Andersson (2018), the object that is targeted in a bias incident is not the self of the victim, but rather a negative stereotype. The participants in this study suffered both victimization and fear of being victimized as a result of their ‘Roma’ ethnicity, irrespective of whether or not they identified with this particular label or group. We would argue that further research should consider bias incidents as a violation of the victims’ opportunities for self-representation, but not necessarily of their self and their identity.
Secondly, it is clear from the study’s findings that there are some Roma who fear the ‘coming-out process’. There is, therefore, a need to develop strategies to support these individuals. We would like to highlight the fact that, according to the results of the current study, there appear to be control mechanisms within the Roma community which mean that those Roma who question the concealment strategy may be discriminated against by their community. This is problematic since there is evidence that the negative consequences of victimization may be more severe if one is victimized by individuals with whom one identifies (Herman, 2015). Also, those Roma who become involved in politics appear to be most at risk. Future research should further investigate this issue. It may be particularly important to gather data on those Roma who are engaged in the political debate on Roma issues.
Finally, being visible in a given society is not in itself inherently disempowering. Being invisible in the political sphere may also cause powerlessness (Perry, 2015). This study shows the importance of gathering and having access to data on different vulnerable populations in society. As a result of a relatively recent wave of migration to Sweden, Swedish society is not as homogenous today as it was a century ago. There are also indications that certain ethnic groups are faring a great deal worse than the ethnic Swedish population in several social aspects. However, due to Sweden not collecting demographic statistics on minorities, it is difficult to draw any conclusions about the situation of different groups regarding, for example, victimization, health or employment. We would argue that Sweden should review the possibility of developing equality data as a means of supporting its minority populations. Some minorities would no doubt be critical of the collection of such data, including the Roma. However, if such data were to be collected, it would also provide the community in question with the opportunity to use this information to support their community more effectively. Until such data are available, researchers should devote their attention to developing strategies for obtaining access to the difficult research field of vulnerable populations. Providing support to society’s marginalized and stigmatized populations is both necessary and important, and as this study has shown, the Roma is one such population.

NASHVILLE -- In 1954, a man called the city desk of The Tennessean, Nashville's daily morning newspaper, to say he planned to take his own life by jumping from the Shelby Avenue Bridge. If the paper wanted the story, he said, they should send a reporter. 
 At the scene, a young journalist named John Seigenthaler spent 40 minutes talking with the man, who was sitting astride a gas pipe that ran beneath the bridge's railing. When the man turned to look at the water below, Mr. Seigenthaler, one leg anchored in the bridge's grillwork, reached down, grabbed him by the collar and held on till nearby police officers could haul him to safety.
 Today the historic bridge, which spans the Cumberland River, is known as the John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge in honor of the journalist who risked his life to save another's -- and got a front-page byline in the process.
 Mr. Seigenthaler was a journalist with The Tennessean for 43 years. As the paper's editor, he led its principled coverage of civil rights in spite of vocal white opposition. Nashville was the first major city in the South to desegregate public facilities, and The Tennessean's fierce support of civil rights is often credited with contributing to the city's relatively peaceful integration.
 ''If it wasn't for the newspaper, Nashville could've been a nasty, awful place,'' said the former Tennessean columnist Dwight Lewis.
 Mr. Seigenthaler died in 2014, and The Tennessean, like every other local newspaper in the country, is a shadow of its former self -- smaller, thinner, slighter, diminished in every measurable way. Even before the coronavirus pandemic shut down the economy and took advertising revenue with it, The Tennessean had already endured round after round of layoffs as its parent company, Gannett, struggled. Its decline accelerated last year when Gannett merged with GateHouse Media, a company known for ''the ransacking of local journalism,'' as Boston Magazine put it.
 A staggering 7,800 journalists lost their jobs in 2019, according to Business Insider. Once the pandemic hit, another 36,000 media-company employees got the pink slip. And all these disasters came on top of continuing losses that collectively cost American newsrooms half their journalists between 2008 and 2019.
 I remind you of all this -- the decades-old history of a newspaper known for advancing progressive causes and the recent history of a media company in thrall to corporate investors -- to provide some context for an appalling advertisement that ran in The Tennessean on June 21.
 The full-page, full-color ad featured images of Donald Trump, Pope Francis and burning American flags, as well as a long, incoherent, biblically illiterate warning that ''Islam is going to detonate a nuclear device in Nashville, Tennessee'' and thereby launch a ''Third World War.''
 Public outcry began early and spread swiftly. Especially given the recent history of vandalism and violent threats against Muslims in Middle Tennessee, ''A huge target was placed on our community,'' said Sabina Mohyuddin, executive director of the American Muslim Advisory Council, a Nashville-based advocacy group. Public calls to unsubscribe from the paper flew around Twitter.
 By midday the ad was ''ordered to be pulled from future editions'' of the paper, according to The Tennessean, and an investigation launched into how this white supremacist screed made it into print in the first place. The paper fired the sales manager who had approved the ad and donated $14,000 -- the value of the ad -- to the American Muslim Advisory Council. The nonprofit will also receive $50,000 in advertising credit.
 The Tennessean editor Michael A. Anastasi called the ad ''inconsistent with everything The Tennessean as an institution stands and has stood for and with the journalism we have produced.''
 Mr. Anastasi wasn't making a reference merely to his newspaper's storied history. In the same print edition of the paper that carried the unforgivable ad, The Tennessean published articles on the ''violence interrupters'' of Gideon's Army, a grass-roots organization that works as a successful alternative to police intervention; Nashville's Juneteenth protest; an interview with the mother of Ashanti Posey, an African-American teenager shot to death in April; and two op-ed columns on racism and policing.
 The issue also included a number of wire reports about hate crimes legislation in Georgia, the removal of Confederate statues in North Carolina, NASCAR's decision to prohibit the display of Confederate flags, and worries by civil rights leaders that the 2020 census is undercounting minority populations.
 You can argue that The Tennessean is now so short of journalists it can't possibly cover the full range of challenges facing this city, and you would be right. You can argue that the statewide focus of Gannett's ''USA Today Network -- Tennessee'' is just a fancy way of ignoring smaller-city news, and you would be right about that, too. But you can't argue that the journalists who actually cover this town are indifferent to the plights of the communities they cover. Tennessean reporters were as appalled by that ad as everyone else.
 As the ''first rough draft of history,'' journalism will always be prone to mistakes, no matter how assiduously reporters and editors try to prevent them. But canceling your newspaper subscription because of one ad, no matter how hideous -- or because of one deeply offensive headline, or one flagrantly dangerous op-ed -- will not cure journalism of what ails it.
 The only thing canceling your subscription to a newspaper will do is hasten the death of journalism itself. It will leave your community with even fewer full-time reporters to tell you what local leaders were up to while you weren't paying attention. It will leave you with a far poorer understanding of the place where you live.
 When tornadoes tore through this town in the middle of the night, Tennessean reporters were out in the dark, getting the story, and for weeks they followed up on where to find help -- and how to offer help -- in the aftermath. When the pandemic hit, they wrote about how Nashville's tourist center was out of control. When violence broke out after George Floyd's death, they were right in the middle of it, never mind that they've all been furloughed for a week of every month.
 The Tennessean will never again have the power to turn an entire city toward the cause of moral justice, it's true, but these journalists are nevertheless heroes, as the calamities of this year have proven beyond any fretful, tweet-fueled doubt. They might not have the chance to save a suicidal man from a local bridge, but they are all heroes anyway. Every last one of them.

BATON ROUGE, La. — A Louisiana lawmaker’s effort to eliminate police officers’ wide immunity from civil lawsuits for damages for injury or death was shelved by Republicans on a state House committee.
The House civil law committee voted 9-7 Wednesday against the measure from Democratic Rep. Edmond Jordan.
More than a dozen black lawmakers stood together in the room to support Jordan’s bill. After the vote, some left in tears.
Supporters of the bill said the immunity is so sweeping that it’s nearly impossible to hold officers accountable for excessive force when prosecutors refuse to bring criminal charges.
Opponents said legal avenues exist to prosecute police for excessive force. The Louisiana Sheriffs’ Association said the measure would make it harder for officers to combat crime.
The vote fell largely along party lines. Two GOP lawmakers joined Democrats in backing the measure, which was proposed after the death last month of George Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody and other recent instances of police brutality.

PORTLAND, Ore. — City commissioners voted Wednesday to cut $16 million from the Portland Police Bureau’s budget in response to concerns about police brutality and racial injustice.
The cuts are part of a city budget approved by the commissioners in a 3-1 vote. The money saved by eliminating the gun reduction violence team, school resource officers and transit officers will be redirected to social service programs. The lone commissioner to vote no said the cuts to police weren’t deep enough.
Thousands of protesters have filled the streets of Portland every night for three weeks following the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis on Memorial Day.

 BOSTON — Police officers in Massachusetts would have to be certified by the state under a bill filed Wednesday by Gov. Charlie Baker.
The bill would also allow for the decertification of officers who engage in excessive force, and it encourages additional training, including for advanced deescalation techniques.
Massachusetts is one of only a few states without a statewide certification program for law enforcement.
The Republican governor said his administration worked with members of the Massachusetts Black and Latino Legislative Caucus and public safety officials to draft the bill.
Baker said at a press conference that the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis at the hands of police officers made it clear it's ""the time to get this done.” He added that improving law enforcement is only one piece of the process.

LONDON — The governing body of Oxford University’s Oriel College has recommended the removal of a statue of Victorian imperialist Cecil Rhodes that has long been the target of protests.
The college’s governors, made up of faculty, met Wednesday and said they had “voted to launch an independent Commission of Inquiry into the key issues surrounding the Rhodes statue.“
A similar campaign has sought the removal of his statue in Oxford. The movement has gained new momentum since the death of George Floyd spurred anti-racism protests around the world.
Rhodes made a fortune from gold and diamond mines in the late 19th century, with miners laboring in brutal conditions. His statue was removed from the University of Cape Town in South Africa in 2015.

RICHMOND, Va. — A statue of African American tennis star Arthur Ashe has been vandalized.
Photos show the base of the monument tagged with white spray paint and the words “white lives matter” as well as the initials “WLM.” Those initials were later painted over with “BLM,” short for black lives matter.
Richmond Police said they were alerted to the vandalism on Monument Avenue about 10:15 a.m. Wednesday. Police say red paint on the statue itself was already being removed by community members.
Authorities have information on possible suspects and are asking the community to call the Crime Stoppers line if they have information on who was responsible for the vandalism.
The monument was dedicated in 1996 to memorialize the Richmond native, who died in 1993, and to counterbalance the string of statues on Memorial Avenue dedicated to Confederate leaders.

LAS VEGAS — The University of Nevada, Las Vegas has removed a statue of its “Hey Reb!” mascot from in front of its alumni center following an outcry from student groups, including the Native American Student Association.
The decision to remove the bronze statue, which was criticized for its relationship to the Confederacy, came weeks after the death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis.
University President Marta Meana says she has had conversations with individuals and stakeholders about how the university can move forward in light of recent events.
The statue is expected to be returned to its donors.

NEW YORK — New York’s governor signed an executive order recognizing Juneteenth as a paid holiday for state employees to commemorate the emancipation of slaves in the U.S.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo called it “a day we should all reflect upon” and “a day that is especially relevant in this moment in history. Cuomo said he’ll propose legislation next year making June 19 a permanent state holiday.
President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation was effective Jan. 1, 1863, but the news took time to travel. It wasn’t until June 19, 1865, when word of the proclamation was brought by the Union army to enslaved people in Texas.

AMSTERDAM — Vandals have daubed red paint and the word “racist” on a statue of Mohandas Gandhi in Amsterdam, amid a wave of attacks on statues around the world of controversial historical figures.
A worker cleaned the statue Wednesday with a high-pressure water hose. Gandhi, widely lauded for his peaceful campaign to win independence for India, has faced criticism for some of his writings about black Africans.
A lawyer, Gandhi traveled to South Africa in 1893 and stayed for two decades, fighting to expand rights for Indians there. He has faced criticism for referring in his writings to black South Africans as backward. However, he later changed his views and supported the rights of black South Africans.
His nonviolent resistance methods have been used in movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.

DETROIT — A white suburban Detroit police chief has been suspended for 30 days without pay and will undergo diversity training for inappropriate social media posts about people protesting the death of George Floyd.
Trustees in Macomb County’s Shelby Township voted 5-2 on Tuesday night on the punishment for chief Robert J. Shelide, who has held the title since 2015.
Shelide, who earlier apologized, told the township board before the vote that he is “not a racist” and “I bleed blue.”
Shelide had been on administrative leave the past two weeks while officials investigated posts on a now-deleted Twitter account. Screenshots posted on Facebook show one tweet spoke about the need to “unleash real cops” and describing protesters as “barbarians” and needing “body bags.“

PORTLAND, Ore. — Police say a man drove his car into a crowd of protesters early Wednesday in downtown Portland, injuring three people.
Police say the 27-year-old male driver drove away “at a high rate of speed,” but was tracked and arrested on suspicion of hit and run, reckless driving and possession of a controlled substance, according to The Oregonian/OregonLive.
Two people were taken by ambulance to a hospital. Another was taken for treatment in a personal car. Police say none of the injuries were life-threatening.

ATLANTA — Georgia’s lieutenant governor is proposing a version of a hate crimes law for the state.
Republican Geoff Duncan called on lawmakers to create a free-standing hate crime and include more categories of bias crimes. Those would involve people victimized because of their culture and their status in exercising First Amendment rights, including worship, free speech, free press, assembly or petition of government.
A previous effort was found unconstitutional by the state Supreme Court more than a decade ago.
In February, Ahmaud Arbery was shot near Brunswick, Georgia. Investigators have said a white man uttered a racial slur after chasing Arbery down and shooting him.
Georgia’s House passed a simpler measure last year that’s been stalled in a Senate committee for more than year. The bill would add extra penalties onto crimes committed because of someone’s race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, mental disability or physical disability.

GENEVA — The brother of George Floyd has made a heartfelt plea to the U.N.’s top human rights body to launch intense international scrutiny of systemic racism and the killing of unarmed blacks by police.
Philonese Floyd’s message by video to the Human Rights Council came as it contemplates an unprecedented bid sought by the Africa Group to create a Commission of Inquiry — the council’s most powerful tool of scrutiny — to examine and report on racism and violence against protesters by police in the United States.
“I am my brother’s keeper. You in the United Nations are your brothers and sisters’ keepers in America — and you have the power to help us get justice for my brother George Floyd,” Floyd said. “I am asking you to help him. I am asking you to help me. I am asking you to help us: Black people in America.”

HUNTINGTON, W.Va. — The Huntington City Council in West Virginia will vote Wednesday on a proposal to make Juneteenth a permanent city holiday.
The celebration commemorates when enslaved people in Texas learned they were free on June 19, 1865. Huntington Mayor Steve Williams told The Herald-Dispatch he supports the proposal and wants the city’s African American residents to know “the city celebrates Juneteenth with them just as we all celebrate July Fourth together.”
The mayor says the idea for the holiday proposal came from meetings with his diversity advisory committee amid the international protests following the death of George Floyd. Williams expects Wednesday’s meeting will help fast-track the resolution so council members can get it in the books before Friday.

HOUSTON — Officials say a statue of a Confederate soldier has been removed from a downtown Houston park and a second Confederate statue is expected to be removed soon.
The “Spirit of the Confederacy” statue was removed late Tuesday from Sam Houston Park. Mayor Sylvester Turner said last week the statue will be housed in the Houston Museum of African American Culture.
A second statue, of Confederate artillery commander Richard W. “Dick” Dowling, is also slated for removal. Initially, the Dowling statue was to be moved from Houston’s Hermann Park to the Sabine Pass Battleground State Historical Site near Port Arthur.
But officials say the Dowling statue will instead be placed in a warehouse, at least temporarily, after leaders in Port Arthur expressed opposition.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — A Roman Catholic chaplain at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has resigned at the request of the archdiocese after sending an email suggesting the killing of George Floyd was not an act of racism and he hadn’t lived “a virtuous life.”
The Archdiocese of Boston asked the Rev. Daniel Patrick Moloney to step down June 9 after he sent the message to Catholics at MIT, The Boston Globe reports. A statement from the archdiocese said Moloney’s comments “were wrong and by his resignation he accepts the hurt they have caused.”
The archdiocese learned about the email from Catholics at MIT and alumni. Moloney says he was trying to speak out against “cancel culture” and regrets his message has been misunderstood.
Suzy Nelson, an MIT vice president and dean for student life, sent an email to students calling Moloney’s comments “deeply disturbing” and “Father Moloney’s message failed to acknowledge the dignity of each human being and the devastating impact of systemic racism.”

MINNEAPOLIS — Minnesota prosecutors acknowledged Wednesday that a police officer had his knee on George Floyd’s neck for 7 minutes, 46 seconds — not the 8:46 that has become a global symbol of police brutality.
The initial complaint alleges Derek Chauvin “had his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds in total. Two minutes and 53 seconds of this was after Mr. Floyd was non-responsive.” But timestamps cited in the document’s description of the incident, much of which was caught on video, showed Chauvin had his knee on Floyd for 7 minutes, 46 seconds, including 1 minute, 53 seconds after Floyd appeared to stop breathing.
Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman’s office said in a statement that “these kinds of technical matters” can be handled in a future amendment to the criminal case if it becomes necessary.
The Associated Press began asking about the error the day after the initial charges were filed, but prosecutors had repeatedly declined to address it as their 8 minutes and 46 seconds began to be used by protesters around the globe for its symbolism.

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Little Rock is banning police from using neck restraints following nationwide protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Mayor Frank Scott said Wednesday.
Scott signed an executive order banning use of the restraints or officers being trained on them, and also requiring officers to intervene to stop their use if they witness it. Scott’s order also requires the city to create and maintain a database on the restraints’ use and any corrective actions taken against officers for using them.
Little Rock Police Chief Keith Humphrey said the department had already banned chokeholds but had allowed a technique known as a “vascular neck restraint.”
The order doesn’t prohibit an officer from using “any reasonable force” if because of actual physical contact they face immediate threat of death or serious injury to themselves or anyone in their immediate vicinity.

BATON ROUGE, La. — A Louisiana lawmaker’s effort to eliminate police officers’ wide immunity from civil lawsuits for damages for injury or death was shelved by Republicans on a state House committee.
The House civil law committee voted 9-7 Wednesday against the measure from Democratic Rep. Edmond Jordan.
More than a dozen black lawmakers stood together in the room to support Jordan’s bill. After the vote, some left in tears.
Supporters of the bill said the immunity is so sweeping that it’s nearly impossible to hold officers accountable for excessive force when prosecutors refuse to bring criminal charges.
Opponents said legal avenues exist to prosecute police for excessive force. The Louisiana Sheriffs’ Association said the measure would make it harder for officers to combat crime.
The vote fell largely along party lines. Two GOP lawmakers joined Democrats in backing the measure, which was proposed after the death last month of George Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody and other recent instances of police brutality.

PORTLAND, Ore. — City commissioners voted Wednesday to cut $16 million from the Portland Police Bureau’s budget in response to concerns about police brutality and racial injustice.
The cuts are part of a city budget approved by the commissioners in a 3-1 vote. The money saved by eliminating the gun reduction violence team, school resource officers and transit officers will be redirected to social service programs. The lone commissioner to vote no said the cuts to police weren’t deep enough.
Thousands of protesters have filled the streets of Portland every night for three weeks following the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis on Memorial Day.

ATLANTA — Georgia’s lieutenant governor is proposing a version of a hate crimes law for the state.
Republican Geoff Duncan called on lawmakers to create a free-standing hate crime and include more categories of bias crimes. Those would involve people victimized because of their culture and their status in exercising First Amendment rights, including worship, free speech, free press, assembly or petition of government.
A previous effort was found unconstitutional by the state Supreme Court more than a decade ago.
In February, Ahmaud Arbery was shot near Brunswick, Georgia. Investigators have said a white man uttered a racial slur after chasing Arbery down and shooting him.
Georgia’s House passed a simpler measure last year that’s been stalled in a Senate committee for more than year. The bill would add extra penalties onto crimes committed because of someone’s race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, mental disability or physical disability.

GENEVA — The brother of George Floyd has made a heartfelt plea to the U.N.’s top human rights body to launch intense international scrutiny of systemic racism and the killing of unarmed blacks by police.
Philonese Floyd’s message by video to the Human Rights Council came as it contemplates an unprecedented bid sought by the Africa Group to create a Commission of Inquiry — the council’s most powerful tool of scrutiny — to examine and report on racism and violence against protesters by police in the United States.
“I am my brother’s keeper. You in the United Nations are your brothers and sisters’ keepers in America — and you have the power to help us get justice for my brother George Floyd,” Floyd said. “I am asking you to help him. I am asking you to help me. I am asking you to help us: Black people in America.”

HUNTINGTON, W.Va. — The Huntington City Council in West Virginia will vote Wednesday on a proposal to make Juneteenth a permanent city holiday.
The celebration commemorates when enslaved people in Texas learned they were free on June 19, 1865. Huntington Mayor Steve Williams told The Herald-Dispatch he supports the proposal and wants the city’s African American residents to know “the city celebrates Juneteenth with them just as we all celebrate July Fourth together.”
The mayor says the idea for the holiday proposal came from meetings with his diversity advisory committee amid the international protests following the death of George Floyd. Williams expects Wednesday’s meeting will help fast-track the resolution so council members can get it in the books before Friday.
The Emancipation Proclamation was signed by President Abraham Lincoln on Jan. 1, 1863, and freed enslaved people of the rebellion Confederate states.

HOUSTON — Officials say a statue of a Confederate soldier has been removed from a downtown Houston park and a second Confederate statue is expected to be removed soon.
The “Spirit of the Confederacy” statue was removed late Tuesday from Sam Houston Park. Mayor Sylvester Turner said last week the statue will be housed in the Houston Museum of African American Culture.
A second statue, of Confederate artillery commander Richard W. “Dick” Dowling, is also slated for removal. Initially, the Dowling statue was to be moved from Houston’s Hermann Park to the Sabine Pass Battleground State Historical Site near Port Arthur.
But officials say the Dowling statue will instead be placed in a warehouse, at least temporarily, after leaders in Port Arthur expressed opposition.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — A Roman Catholic chaplain at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has resigned at the request of the archdiocese after sending an email suggesting the killing of George Floyd was not an act of racism and he hadn’t lived “a virtuous life.”
The Archdiocese of Boston asked the Rev. Daniel Patrick Moloney to step down June 9 after he sent the message to Catholics at MIT, The Boston Globe reports. A statement from the archdiocese said Moloney’s comments “were wrong and by his resignation he accepts the hurt they have caused.”
The archdiocese learned about the email from Catholics at MIT and alumni. Moloney says he was trying to speak out against “cancel culture” and regrets his message has been misunderstood.
Suzy Nelson, an MIT vice president and dean for student life, sent an email to students calling Moloney’s comments “deeply disturbing” and “Father Moloney’s message failed to acknowledge the dignity of each human being and the devastating impact of systemic racism.”

MINNEAPOLIS — Minnesota prosecutors acknowledged Wednesday that a police officer had his knee on George Floyd’s neck for 7 minutes, 46 seconds — not the 8:46 that has become a global symbol of police brutality.
The initial complaint alleges Derek Chauvin “had his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds in total. Two minutes and 53 seconds of this was after Mr. Floyd was non-responsive.” But timestamps cited in the document’s description of the incident, much of which was caught on video, showed Chauvin had his knee on Floyd for 7 minutes, 46 seconds, including 1 minute, 53 seconds after Floyd appeared to stop breathing.
Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman’s office said in a statement that “these kinds of technical matters” can be handled in a future amendment to the criminal case if it becomes necessary.
The Associated Press began asking about the error the day after the initial charges were filed, but prosecutors had repeatedly declined to address it as their 8 minutes and 46 seconds began to be used by protesters around the globe for its symbolism.

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Little Rock is banning police from using neck restraints following nationwide protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Mayor Frank Scott said Wednesday.
Scott signed an executive order banning use of the restraints or officers being trained on them, and also requiring officers to intervene to stop their use if they witness it. Scott’s order also requires the city to create and maintain a database on the restraints’ use and any corrective actions taken against officers for using them.
Little Rock Police Chief Keith Humphrey said the department had already banned chokeholds but had allowed a technique known as a “vascular neck restraint.”
The order doesn’t prohibit an officer from using “any reasonable force” if because of actual physical contact they face immediate threat of death or serious injury to themselves or anyone in their immediate vicinity.

GENEVA — The brother of George Floyd has made a heartfelt plea to the U.N.’s top human rights body to launch intense international scrutiny of systemic racism and the killing of unarmed blacks by police.
Philonese Floyd’s message by video to the Human Rights Council came as it contemplates an unprecedented bid sought by the Africa Group to create a Commission of Inquiry — the council’s most powerful tool of scrutiny — to examine and report on racism and violence against protesters by police in the United States.
“I am my brother’s keeper. You in the United Nations are your brothers and sisters’ keepers in America — and you have the power to help us get justice for my brother George Floyd,” Floyd said. “I am asking you to help him. I am asking you to help me. I am asking you to help us: Black people in America.”

MINNEAPOLIS — Minnesota prosecutors acknowledged Wednesday that a police officer had his knee on George Floyd’s neck for 7 minutes, 46 seconds — not the 8:46 that has become a global symbol of police brutality.
The initial complaint alleges Derek Chauvin “had his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds in total. Two minutes and 53 seconds of this was after Mr. Floyd was non-responsive.” But timestamps cited in the document’s description of the incident, much of which was caught on video, showed Chauvin had his knee on Floyd for 7 minutes, 46 seconds, including 1 minute, 53 seconds after Floyd appeared to stop breathing.
Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman’s office said in a statement that “these kinds of technical matters” can be handled in a future amendment to the criminal case if it becomes necessary.
The Associated Press began asking about the error the day after the initial charges were filed, but prosecutors had repeatedly declined to address it as their 8 minutes and 46 seconds began to be used by protesters around the globe for its symbolism.

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Little Rock is banning police from using neck restraints following nationwide protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Mayor Frank Scott said Wednesday.
Scott signed an executive order banning use of the restraints or officers being trained on them, and also requiring officers to intervene to stop their use if they witness it. Scott’s order also requires the city to create and maintain a database on the restraints’ use and any corrective actions taken against officers for using them.
Little Rock Police Chief Keith Humphrey said the department had already banned chokeholds but had allowed a technique known as a “vascular neck restraint.”
The order doesn’t prohibit an officer from using “any reasonable force” if because of actual physical contact they face immediate threat of death or serious injury to themselves or anyone in their immediate vicinity.

BATON ROUGE, La. — A Louisiana lawmaker’s effort to eliminate police officers’ wide immunity from civil lawsuits for damages for injury or death was shelved by Republicans on a state House committee.
The House civil law committee voted 9-7 Wednesday against the measure from Democratic Rep. Edmond Jordan.
More than a dozen black lawmakers stood together in the room to support Jordan’s bill. After the vote, some left in tears.
Supporters of the bill said the immunity is so sweeping that it’s nearly impossible to hold officers accountable for excessive force when prosecutors refuse to bring criminal charges.
Opponents said legal avenues exist to prosecute police for excessive force. The Louisiana Sheriffs’ Association said the measure would make it harder for officers to combat crime.
The vote fell largely along party lines. Two GOP lawmakers joined Democrats in backing the measure, which was proposed after the death last month of George Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody and other recent instances of police brutality.

PORTLAND, Ore. — City commissioners voted Wednesday to cut $16 million from the Portland Police Bureau’s budget in response to concerns about police brutality and racial injustice.
The cuts are part of a city budget approved by the commissioners in a 3-1 vote. The money saved by eliminating the gun reduction violence team, school resource officers and transit officers will be redirected to social service programs. The lone commissioner to vote no said the cuts to police weren’t deep enough.
Thousands of protesters have filled the streets of Portland every night for three weeks following the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis on Memorial Day.

ATLANTA — The police officer who fatally shot Rayshard Brooks in the back after the fleeing man pointed a stun gun in his direction is going to be charged with felony murder and 10 other crimes.
Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard made the announcement about Garrett Rolfe during a news conference Wednesday.
Howard said Rolfe kicked Brooks while he lay on the ground and that the officer with him, Devin Brosnan, stood on Brooks’ shoulder as he struggled for life Friday night.
Rolfe had already been fired after he fatally shot the 27-year-old Brooks. Brosnan had been put on administrative leave.
Brosnan is being charged with aggravated assault and other crimes. The shooting had sparked new demonstrations in Georgia’s capital against police brutality.

 BOSTON — Police officers in Massachusetts would have to be certified by the state under a bill filed Wednesday by Gov. Charlie Baker.
The bill would also allow for the decertification of officers who engage in excessive force, and it encourages additional training, including for advanced deescalation techniques.
Massachusetts is one of only a few states without a statewide certification program for law enforcement.
The Republican governor said his administration worked with members of the Massachusetts Black and Latino Legislative Caucus and public safety officials to draft the bill.
Baker said at a press conference that the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis at the hands of police officers made it clear it's ""the time to get this done.” He added that improving law enforcement is only one piece of the process.

LONDON — The governing body of Oxford University’s Oriel College has recommended the removal of a statue of Victorian imperialist Cecil Rhodes that has long been the target of protests.
The college’s governors, made up of faculty, met Wednesday and said they had “voted to launch an independent Commission of Inquiry into the key issues surrounding the Rhodes statue.“
A similar campaign has sought the removal of his statue in Oxford. The movement has gained new momentum since the death of George Floyd spurred anti-racism protests around the world.
Rhodes made a fortune from gold and diamond mines in the late 19th century, with miners laboring in brutal conditions. His statue was removed from the University of Cape Town in South Africa in 2015.

RICHMOND, Va. — A statue of African American tennis star Arthur Ashe has been vandalized.
Photos show the base of the monument tagged with white spray paint and the words “white lives matter” as well as the initials “WLM.” Those initials were later painted over with “BLM,” short for black lives matter.
Richmond Police said they were alerted to the vandalism on Monument Avenue about 10:15 a.m. Wednesday. Police say red paint on the statue itself was already being removed by community members.
Authorities have information on possible suspects and are asking the community to call the Crime Stoppers line if they have information on who was responsible for the vandalism.
The monument was dedicated in 1996 to memorialize the Richmond native, who died in 1993, and to counterbalance the string of statues on Memorial Avenue dedicated to Confederate leaders.

LAS VEGAS — The University of Nevada, Las Vegas has removed a statue of its “Hey Reb!” mascot from in front of its alumni center following an outcry from student groups, including the Native American Student Association.
The decision to remove the bronze statue, which was criticized for its relationship to the Confederacy, came weeks after the death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis.
University President Marta Meana says she has had conversations with individuals and stakeholders about how the university can move forward in light of recent events.
The statue is expected to be returned to its donors.

NEW YORK — New York’s governor signed an executive order recognizing Juneteenth as a paid holiday for state employees to commemorate the emancipation of slaves in the U.S.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo called it “a day we should all reflect upon” and “a day that is especially relevant in this moment in history. Cuomo said he’ll propose legislation next year making June 19 a permanent state holiday.
President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation was effective Jan. 1, 1863, but the news took time to travel. It wasn’t until June 19, 1865, when word of the proclamation was brought by the Union army to enslaved people in Texas.

AMSTERDAM — Vandals have daubed red paint and the word “racist” on a statue of Mohandas Gandhi in Amsterdam, amid a wave of attacks on statues around the world of controversial historical figures.
A worker cleaned the statue Wednesday with a high-pressure water hose. Gandhi, widely lauded for his peaceful campaign to win independence for India, has faced criticism for some of his writings about black Africans.
A lawyer, Gandhi traveled to South Africa in 1893 and stayed for two decades, fighting to expand rights for Indians there. He has faced criticism for referring in his writings to black South Africans as backward. However, he later changed his views and supported the rights of black South Africans.
His nonviolent resistance methods have been used in movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.

DETROIT — A white suburban Detroit police chief has been suspended for 30 days without pay and will undergo diversity training for inappropriate social media posts about people protesting the death of George Floyd.
Trustees in Macomb County’s Shelby Township voted 5-2 on Tuesday night on the punishment for chief Robert J. Shelide, who has held the title since 2015.
Shelide, who earlier apologized, told the township board before the vote that he is “not a racist” and “I bleed blue.”
Shelide had been on administrative leave the past two weeks while officials investigated posts on a now-deleted Twitter account. Screenshots posted on Facebook show one tweet spoke about the need to “unleash real cops” and describing protesters as “barbarians” and needing “body bags.“

PORTLAND, Ore. — Police say a man drove his car into a crowd of protesters early Wednesday in downtown Portland, injuring three people.
Police say the 27-year-old male driver drove away “at a high rate of speed,” but was tracked and arrested on suspicion of hit and run, reckless driving and possession of a controlled substance, according to The Oregonian/OregonLive.
Two people were taken by ambulance to a hospital. Another was taken for treatment in a personal car. Police say none of the injuries were life-threatening.

HUNTINGTON, W.Va. — The Huntington City Council in West Virginia will vote Wednesday on a proposal to make Juneteenth a permanent city holiday.
The celebration commemorates when enslaved people in Texas learned they were free on June 19, 1865. Huntington Mayor Steve Williams told The Herald-Dispatch he supports the proposal and wants the city’s African American residents to know “the city celebrates Juneteenth with them just as we all celebrate July Fourth together.”
The mayor says the idea for the holiday proposal came from meetings with his diversity advisory committee amid the international protests following the death of George Floyd. Williams expects Wednesday’s meeting will help fast-track the resolution so council members can get it in the books before Friday.
The Emancipation Proclamation was signed by President Abraham Lincoln on Jan. 1, 1863, and freed enslaved people of the rebellion Confederate states.

HOUSTON — Officials say a statue of a Confederate soldier has been removed from a downtown Houston park and a second Confederate statue is expected to be removed soon.
The “Spirit of the Confederacy” statue was removed late Tuesday from Sam Houston Park. Mayor Sylvester Turner said last week the statue will be housed in the Houston Museum of African American Culture.
A second statue, of Confederate artillery commander Richard W. “Dick” Dowling, is also slated for removal. Initially, the Dowling statue was to be moved from Houston’s Hermann Park to the Sabine Pass Battleground State Historical Site near Port Arthur.
But officials say the Dowling statue will instead be placed in a warehouse, at least temporarily, after leaders in Port Arthur expressed opposition.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — A Roman Catholic chaplain at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has resigned at the request of the archdiocese after sending an email suggesting the killing of George Floyd was not an act of racism and he hadn’t lived “a virtuous life.”
The Archdiocese of Boston asked the Rev. Daniel Patrick Moloney to step down June 9 after he sent the message to Catholics at MIT, The Boston Globe reports. A statement from the archdiocese said Moloney’s comments “were wrong and by his resignation he accepts the hurt they have caused.”
The archdiocese learned about the email from Catholics at MIT and alumni. Moloney says he was trying to speak out against “cancel culture” and regrets his message has been misunderstood.
Suzy Nelson, an MIT vice president and dean for student life, sent an email to students calling Moloney’s comments “deeply disturbing” and “Father Moloney’s message failed to acknowledge the dignity of each human being and the devastating impact of systemic racism.”

It is a killer unlike anything you have ever seen before. It comes in for the attack when you least expect it. 
Seeing all the assaults on President Trump, from the day he took office, should be enough to make you question why they are trying so hard to remove him. Why are they trying so hard to discredit him, to slander him and even willing to commit criminal acts themselves just to remove him? No President, in the history of this country, has been under attack the way President Trump has been/is. Think about that. We have never been subject to this much lawlessness and blatant disregard for humanity, our history and for police officers the we have seen in recent months. Law and order is what you are voting on this coming election and the push for mail in ballots are just another democratic scheme to defraud the election. Make no mistake mail in ballots are not the same as absentee ballots. You should know the difference and why one would be more susceptible to fraud then the other. But that is not what this article is about. This is about law and order, racism, discrimination and a failing society led by leftist radicals. With the cries to defund the police the general public was told, 'We won't defund them literally' rather we will reorganize etc. The truth is they are defunding the police and law enforcement officers, nation wide, have been under attack for months now with no help and no support. The states and cities run by democrats have unprecedented increases in violent crimes. While you are afraid to go outside or fear you will be attacked, they, the democrats, are quite safe in their mansions with their taxpayer paid security teams. President Trump said, 'We have one city, two cities in particular, worse than Honduras, worse than Afghanistan. These are cities within the United States, Democrat-run. Radical left-run. You see what's going on in Seattle. Seattle of all places, who would even think that's possible,' he said, adding: The Democrats want to weaken very substantially our law enforcement, our police. Frankly, they want to defund [police departments], at least largely. Some want to defund and abolish our police. If nothing happens with [police reform], it's one of those things. We had different philosophies. They want open borders. They want sanctuary cities. We don't.'(Article Continues Below Advertisement) At the end of this article is a list of the most crime ridden cities and theirDemocratic mayors. It doesn't include the Democrat governors and district attorneys who are allowing the crime to grow exponentially.The constituents of these politicians are living in fear, they are attacked, injured, murdered, their business destroyed and literally held hostage by marxists groups and the politicians.BLM and Antifa show up at private residences making demands, often times getting and publishing the private information of individuals from the politicians. Police officers are retiring or quitting as a result of the abuse and lack of support they receive in the cities and states run by Democrats.As more and more Police officers resign or quit their jobs homicide rates and other crimes soar. Seattle's first Black Police Chief resigns, two hundred officers have resigned or quit in Colorado. In New York police officers are resigning or quitting in vast numbers, same story inMilwaukee, Atlanta, Chicago, Seattle, Minneapolis, Detroit, Philadelphia, Fort Worth, Dallas and the list continues to grow. As the defund/remove the police effort continues to move forward hate crimes, discrimination, racism and attacks against white people are also growing nation wide. Democrat &#38; Republican politicians along with the mainstream media all sit back and remain silent. If a white person or anyone of color speaks up or tries to defend themself they are immediately silenced; they are called racists, white supremacists, Karen, white privilege, and so on. This has been going on for decades under the disguise of 'tolerance' and we all sat back and did nothing. Houston, December 30, 2018 7 year old Jazmine Barnes was gunned down in her car while driving to Walmart with her mom and sister. Jazmine's mother and 15 year old sister told police a white man with blue eyes pulled up to the families car and opened fire, killing the 7 year old. The case drew immediate attention and hate crime allegations spread like wild fire. Based on the description the family gave the Harris County Sheriff's Department issued a composite sketch. Anti-cop activist Shaun King immediately offered a reward and sent out a Tweet to his 1.1million followers on twitter which included a mugshot of Robert Paul Contrell who looks similar to the sketch. King tweeted and later removed, URGENT. ALL HANDS ON DECK. A 40 y/o white man w/ a beard in a red pickup truck pulled up on 7 y/o Jazmine Barnes and her family near a Houston @Walmartand shot and killed her and injured others. We've had 20 people call or email us and say he is a racist, violent (expletive) and always has been. Just tell me everything you know. Robert Paul Cantrell, 49, was arrested and wrongly accused was found by guards hanging in his Montgomery County Jail cell about 4:20 a.m . on July 23, 2019. He was declared dead on scene.' Cantrell was white with blue eyes and was almost immediately arrested. The two men who actually killed 7 year old Jazmine where both black, Eric Black Jr and Larry D. Woodruffe who were later charged with capital murder. The family of Cantrell continued to get death treats as the result of his mugshot being circulated on social media. 'In one Facebook message to Cantrell's niece, Hailey, an online commenter wrote, 'Someone is going to rape, torture and murder the women and children in your family.' More recently 5 year oldCannon Hinnant from Atlanta, GA was shot and killed by a black man right in his front yard. The man walked up to Cannon put a gun to the back of his head and killed him while his siblings watched. Black Supremacists continue to voice their plans to attack white people or demand reparations from them. They show up in white neighborhoods or parks. They attack white people just walking down the street. (See the video of black man pushing old woman in NY). Look at the recent video of the white truck driver beaten unconscious by Antifa/BLM in Portland. On and on it goes. February 2017: BLM leaderYusra Khogali says 'Whites are sub-Human; should be 'wiped out'. She has posted on her Facebook page: 'whites are 'sub-human.'Whiteness is not humxness, in fact, white skin is sub-humxn,' she wrote. 'All phenotypes exist within the black family and white ppl are a genetic defect of blackness.' Racism against white people is everywhere, it has been going on for decades, but where is the outrage? Where is the cry for justice? Where is the indignation for the continual racism against white men, women and children? Grade schools, universities, accompanied by so many of the hypocrites in Corporate American along with professional sports have all surrendered to the racism against anyone white. They all choose incorporating racist, discriminatory anti -white propaganda into education, employee training, and in sports. They are vocal and they don't care who's listening.Black supremacist's are out of control as they wage their attacks on caucasians, law enforcement officers and even some black people and yet they continue unscathed. Politicians sit on the sidelines refusing to stop the violence, the racism, and ostensibly enjoy the division they are creating. They refuse to support the police and bring law and order to their communities. One has to wonder, 'Are democrats intentionally trying to cause a civil war?' The rhetoric and hypocrisy of the Democratic Party is blatantly obvious, one just has to look at all the actors who spoke at the DNC the past few nights. Was that a comedy or a drama; well, that depends on who was speaking, nevertheless the majority of it was fiction.While you worry about the current state of affairs, the rise in crime, growing racism against white people, the economy, the virus, etc. they were hiding in the safety of their mansions with no plans of discussing any real issues or their real intent. The DNC contained no serious content; God forbid they actually speak about anything worthwhile. They believe they are smart and you are dumb, therefore, they need to control every aspect of your life including what you are allowed to think. Theycondone the words and actions of BLM and Antifa who are both anti- American terrorist groups, while ignoring your pleas for help.They want to inflict shame, fear, control, and power over the masses. They are doing things like defunding/removing/not supporting the police without the support of the people who put them in office. They are literally ignoring you, their boss, while implementing their own agenda. Just a reminder: Yes, some changes need to be made in law enforcement and some officers do bad things, but the majority just do the job they were hired to do. Without law enforcement there is chaos, as they continue to leave their positions, hysteria spreads and so does crime, especially violent crime. The people you voted for are abusing their power, their office, their position, and you, the ones who put them in office in the first place. They are allowing cities, statues, businesses to be destroyed while not prosecuting the criminals. They are anti American, anti Capitalist, anti police. They are silencing anyone of European, white descent. They are Racist. They are putting anti-white propaganda into education; yes they are brainwashing your children and turning them into activists. The Democratic Party you think you know from the past doesn't exist anymore, you must see it, they took a left turn and never came back. If you live in America and want freedom, law and order and a thriving economy then its time to wake up and realize ALL LIVES MATTER and take your country back from these radicals.

PORTLAND, Ore. — City commissioners voted Wednesday to cut $16 million from the Portland Police Bureau’s budget in response to concerns about police brutality and racial injustice.
The cuts are part of a city budget approved by the commissioners in a 3-1 vote. The money saved by eliminating the gun reduction violence team, school resource officers and transit officers will be redirected to social service programs. The lone commissioner to vote no said the cuts to police weren’t deep enough.
Thousands of protesters have filled the streets of Portland every night for three weeks following the death last month of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes.
___
ATLANTA — The police officer who fatally shot Rayshard Brooks in the back after the fleeing man pointed a stun gun in his direction is going to be charged with felony murder and 10 other crimes.
Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard made the announcement about Garrett Rolfe during a news conference Wednesday.
Howard said Rolfe kicked Brooks while he lay on the ground and that the officer with him, Devin Brosnan, stood on Brooks’ shoulder as he struggled for life Friday night.
Rolfe had already been fired after he fatally shot the 27-year-old Brooks. Brosnan had been put on administrative leave.
Brosnan is being charged with aggravated assault and other crimes. The shooting had sparked new demonstrations in Georgia’s capital against police brutality.

 BOSTON — Police officers in Massachusetts would have to be certified by the state under a bill filed Wednesday by Gov. Charlie Baker.
The bill would also allow for the decertification of officers who engage in excessive force, and it encourages additional training, including for advanced deescalation techniques.
Massachusetts is one of only a few states without a statewide certification program for law enforcement.
The Republican governor said his administration worked with members of the Massachusetts Black and Latino Legislative Caucus and public safety officials to draft the bill.
Baker said at a press conference that the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis at the hands of police officers made it clear it's ""the time to get this done.” He added that improving law enforcement is only one piece of the process.

LONDON — The governing body of Oxford University’s Oriel College has recommended the removal of a statue of Victorian imperialist Cecil Rhodes that has long been the target of protests.
The college’s governors, made up of faculty, met Wednesday and said they had “voted to launch an independent Commission of Inquiry into the key issues surrounding the Rhodes statue.“
A similar campaign has sought the removal of his statue in Oxford. The movement has gained new momentum since the death of George Floyd spurred anti-racism protests around the world.
Rhodes made a fortune from gold and diamond mines in the late 19th century, with miners laboring in brutal conditions. His statue was removed from the University of Cape Town in South Africa in 2015.
___
RICHMOND, Va. — A statue of African American tennis star Arthur Ashe has been vandalized.
Photos show the base of the monument tagged with white spray paint and the words “white lives matter” as well as the initials “WLM.” Those initials were later painted over with “BLM,” short for black lives matter.
Richmond Police said they were alerted to the vandalism on Monument Avenue about 10:15 a.m. Wednesday. Police say red paint on the statue itself was already being removed by community members.
Authorities have information on possible suspects and are asking the community to call the Crime Stoppers line if they have information on who was responsible for the vandalism.
The monument was dedicated in 1996 to memorialize the Richmond native, who died in 1993, and to counterbalance the string of statues on Memorial Avenue dedicated to Confederate leaders.

LAS VEGAS — The University of Nevada, Las Vegas has removed a statue of its “Hey Reb!” mascot from in front of its alumni center following an outcry from student groups, including the Native American Student Association.
The decision to remove the bronze statue, which was criticized for its relationship to the Confederacy, came weeks after the death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis.
University President Marta Meana says she has had conversations with individuals and stakeholders about how the university can move forward in light of recent events.
The statue is expected to be returned to its donors.

NEW YORK — New York’s governor signed an executive order recognizing Juneteenth as a paid holiday for state employees to commemorate the emancipation of slaves in the U.S.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo called it “a day we should all reflect upon” and “a day that is especially relevant in this moment in history. Cuomo said he’ll propose legislation next year making June 19 a permanent state holiday.
President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation was effective Jan. 1, 1863, but the news took time to travel. It wasn’t until June 19, 1865, when word of the proclamation was brought by the Union army to enslaved people in Texas.

AMSTERDAM — Vandals have daubed red paint and the word “racist” on a statue of Mohandas Gandhi in Amsterdam, amid a wave of attacks on statues around the world of controversial historical figures.
A worker cleaned the statue Wednesday with a high-pressure water hose. Gandhi, widely lauded for his peaceful campaign to win independence for India, has faced criticism for some of his writings about black Africans.
A lawyer, Gandhi traveled to South Africa in 1893 and stayed for two decades, fighting to expand rights for Indians there. He has faced criticism for referring in his writings to black South Africans as backward. However, he later changed his views and supported the rights of black South Africans.
His nonviolent resistance methods have been used in movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.

DETROIT — A white suburban Detroit police chief has been suspended for 30 days without pay and will undergo diversity training for inappropriate social media posts about people protesting the death of George Floyd.
Trustees in Macomb County’s Shelby Township voted 5-2 on Tuesday night on the punishment for chief Robert J. Shelide, who has held the title since 2015.
Shelide, who earlier apologized, told the township board before the vote that he is “not a racist” and “I bleed blue.”
Shelide had been on administrative leave the past two weeks while officials investigated posts on a now-deleted Twitter account. Screenshots posted on Facebook show one tweet spoke about the need to “unleash real cops” and describing protesters as “barbarians” and needing “body bags.“

PORTLAND, Ore. — Police say a man drove his car into a crowd of protesters early Wednesday in downtown Portland, injuring three people.
Police say the 27-year-old male driver drove away “at a high rate of speed,” but was tracked and arrested on suspicion of hit and run, reckless driving and possession of a controlled substance, according to The Oregonian/OregonLive.
Two people were taken by ambulance to a hospital. Another was taken for treatment in a personal car. Police say none of the injuries were life-threatening.
___
ATLANTA — Georgia’s lieutenant governor is proposing a version of a hate crimes law for the state.
Republican Geoff Duncan called on lawmakers to create a free-standing hate crime and include more categories of bias crimes. Those would involve people victimized because of their culture and their status in exercising First Amendment rights, including worship, free speech, free press, assembly or petition of government.
A previous effort was found unconstitutional by the state Supreme Court more than a decade ago.
In February, Ahmaud Arbery was shot near Brunswick, Georgia. Investigators have said a white man uttered a racial slur after chasing Arbery down and shooting him.
Georgia’s House passed a simpler measure last year that’s been stalled in a Senate committee for more than year. The bill would add extra penalties onto crimes committed because of someone’s race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, mental disability or physical disability.

GENEVA — The brother of George Floyd has made a heartfelt plea to the U.N.’s top human rights body to launch intense international scrutiny of systemic racism and the killing of unarmed blacks by police.
Philonese Floyd’s message by video to the Human Rights Council came as it contemplates an unprecedented bid sought by the Africa Group to create a Commission of Inquiry — the council’s most powerful tool of scrutiny — to examine and report on racism and violence against protesters by police in the United States.
“I am my brother’s keeper. You in the United Nations are your brothers and sisters’ keepers in America — and you have the power to help us get justice for my brother George Floyd,” Floyd said. “I am asking you to help him. I am asking you to help me. I am asking you to help us: Black people in America.”

HUNTINGTON, W.Va. — The Huntington City Council in West Virginia will vote Wednesday on a proposal to make Juneteenth a permanent city holiday.
The celebration commemorates when enslaved people in Texas learned they were free on June 19, 1865. Huntington Mayor Steve Williams told The Herald-Dispatch he supports the proposal and wants the city’s African American residents to know “the city celebrates Juneteenth with them just as we all celebrate July Fourth together.”
The mayor says the idea for the holiday proposal came from meetings with his diversity advisory committee amid the international protests following the death of George Floyd. Williams expects Wednesday’s meeting will help fast-track the resolution so council members can get it in the books before Friday.
The Emancipation Proclamation was signed by President Abraham Lincoln on Jan. 1, 1863, and freed enslaved people of the rebellion Confederate states.

HOUSTON — Officials say a statue of a Confederate soldier has been removed from a downtown Houston park and a second Confederate statue is expected to be removed soon.
The “Spirit of the Confederacy” statue was removed late Tuesday from Sam Houston Park. Mayor Sylvester Turner said last week the statue will be housed in the Houston Museum of African American Culture.
A second statue, of Confederate artillery commander Richard W. “Dick” Dowling, is also slated for removal. Initially, the Dowling statue was to be moved from Houston’s Hermann Park to the Sabine Pass Battleground State Historical Site near Port Arthur.
But officials say the Dowling statue will instead be placed in a warehouse, at least temporarily, after leaders in Port Arthur expressed opposition.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — A Roman Catholic chaplain at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has resigned at the request of the archdiocese after sending an email suggesting the killing of George Floyd was not an act of racism and he hadn’t lived “a virtuous life.”
The Archdiocese of Boston asked the Rev. Daniel Patrick Moloney to step down June 9 after he sent the message to Catholics at MIT, The Boston Globe reports. A statement from the archdiocese said Moloney’s comments “were wrong and by his resignation he accepts the hurt they have caused.”
The archdiocese learned about the email from Catholics at MIT and alumni. Moloney says he was trying to speak out against “cancel culture” and regrets his message has been misunderstood.
Suzy Nelson, an MIT vice president and dean for student life, sent an email to students calling Moloney’s comments “deeply disturbing” and “Father Moloney’s message failed to acknowledge the dignity of each human being and the devastating impact of systemic racism.”

Aired 6:30-7a ET",FALSE,"[06:30:00]
ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR: Now, here's something curious, Abby. In 2015, Donald Trump felt differently about this. A reporter asked him whether -- basically whether the confederate flag should be retired. And let me just play you how he felt in 2015.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You're the lone Republican presidential candidate who has yet to weigh in on whether or not you think the confederate flag should be flying above the statehouse in South Carolina. Do you think it needs to go?
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (June 23, 2015): I think it probably does, and I think they should put it in the museum. Let it go. Respect whatever it is that you have to respect because it was a point in time and put it in a museum. But I would take it down, yes.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CAMEROTA: Sorry, I didn't realize the audio was kind of lousy.
Basically he says he thinks it should go from the statehouse.
ABBY PHILLIP, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes.
CAMEROTA: He thinks it should be retired to a museum. He thinks it's time to let it go.
So, five years later, when the country has advanced from that position, why is he reverting to something so much more archaic?
PHILLIP: Yes. You know, it's interesting, because I -- yesterday, I actually went back and I was trying to find out -- because Kayleigh McEnany had said something interesting at the briefing. She said that people had asked about confederate flags being flown at the president's rallies. She said that, you know, non-campaign merchandise isn't allowed to be flown at his rallies.
So I went back to go see, because I have seen confederate flags at the president's rallies. And they were actually fairly commonplace back in 2016 and 2015 when he was first running for president. This is something that the president's supporters tend to pull out. When I was in Tulsa just a couple of weeks ago, there were confederate flags all over the place in the crowd of people waiting to get into the president's rallies.
So I think -- I do think one of the things that has changed, perhaps, is that the president is trying to respond to where he thinks his supporters are. And there are some people among his supporters who do want to be able to fly the confederate battle flag. They bring it to his rallies. It's a point of pride for them. And the president always wants to seem to be responding to that.
But I also think, this is a political moment where the president and his campaign believes it's advantageous to make an argument that they are for preserving some version of history that is represented by the confederate flag and that, you know, the anarchists and the far left wing activities are for taking it down. That is an expedient argument, but it's also not one that even five years ago President Trump himself believed in, apparently.
BERMAN: It's also -- it undercuts all the work that the White House and his political team try to do over the weekend. They desperately wanted this to be about Mt. Rushmore and George Washington and Thomas Jefferson because they think that's a -- a cleaner fight. And the president just undercut that.
Let me just read a tweet quickly from Rich Lowry. He said, step one, deliver an excellent speech. Step two, step all over it with a stupid and indefensible tweet. Repeat as necessary.
So, he cut his own legs out from under him, no question about it.
All right, Abby, thanks so much.
CAMEROTA: Thanks, Abby.
PHILLIP: Thanks, guys.
CAMEROTA: All right, developing right now, the U.S. government awarding its biggest contract to develop a coronavirus vaccine. We have the breaking details for you, next.
[06:37:07]
BERMAN: We have breaking news in the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine. The U.S. government has just awarded its largest contract to date for vaccine development to the Maryland biotech firm Novavax.
CNN's Elizabeth Cohen spoke with the company's CEO. She joins us now with the breaking details.
Elizabeth.
ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: John, good morning. This is a $1.6 billion -- that's billion with a ""b"" -- contract to Novavax. It's the largest of any of the contracts that Operation Warp Speed or the federal government have done for a Covid-19 vaccine. Now, they think that they could have this vaccine -- Novavax thinks it could have this vaccine on the market by the first quarter of next year if all goes well.
Now, they're currently doing preliminary trials in just 131 patients. They need to move on to large, phase three clinical trials of 30,000 people.
I sat down with the CEO of Novavax, Stanley Erck, and asked him, when will you be starting these phase three trials?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
COHEN: When do you expect to begin your large-scale phase three trials?
STANLEY ERCK, CEO, NOVAVAX: I think in the fourth quarter. We don't have a date set yet, but hopefully as early in the fourth quarter as possible. Maybe, if we're -- if we're lucky, we could start phase three in -- in late third quarter.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
COHEN: Now, there are three other companies that have gotten money from the federal government. The first of those, Moderna, expects to start their phase three trials during -- in sometime this month, at the end of this month. And they say that they could have a vaccine on the market by the end of this year or the beginning of next year.

CAMEROTA: This morning, 31 states are seeing coronavirus cases spike, including Arizona, where higher numbers of young people are infected. In West Virginia, masks are now mandatory.
CNN has reporters across the country covering all the latest headlines.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
EVAN MCMORRIS SANTORO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I'm Evan McMorris Santoro in Phoenix. Arizona passed a grim milestone Monday as authorities reported that for the first time since this pandemic began, the total number of cases here crossed 100,000. Over half of those infected are between the ages of 20 and 44, a number the Phoenix mayor worries could be due to early reopening that saw bars and gathering places crowded with young people before being closed down again last week. On Monday, another 3,300 cases were reported as the pandemic continues to grow here.
NICK WATT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I'm Nick Watt in Santa Monica, California.
Now, since the beginning of this Covid-19 pandemic, there has, apparently, been a huge spike in anti-Asian racial incidents here in California. A group called the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council has logged 800 such cases. Among them, 81 physical assaults.
Now, they say that they want the governor to create a racial bias strike team. They say they've given him the tactics. Now they want concrete action.
JASON CARROLL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I'm Jason Carroll in New York.
West Virginia is now the latest state with a statewide policy on wearing some sort of a face covering. The executive order went into effect at midnight. Going forward, all people age nine and older are required to wear a face covering in places indoors where social distancing is not possible. The order does not apply to anyone who has trouble breathing or cannot remove a face mask covering without assistance. That according to Governor Jim Justice, who announced the executive order on Monday. Penalties were not specified for those who do not follow the order. Governor Justice saying, quote, I know it's not the popular thing to do. He went on to say, it's the only thing we can do and it's the smart thing we can do.

Harvard and Princeton will welcome students back to campus this fall the universities announced Monday. Harvard plans to bring up to 40 percent of undergraduates back to campus for the fall semester, including all first-year students. Seniors would then return for the spring semester while first-years would return home and learn remotely in the spring. However, classes will still be conducted entirely online, including for those students living on campus. Those living on campus will also be subjected to Covid-19 testing once they arrive, followed by subsequent testing every three days. Princeton also announced a 10 percent reduction in undergraduate tuition for the school year. Harvard said that they would not be adjusting their tuition rates.

BERMAN: So, flash flooding in the Philadelphia area leading to at least 26 water rescues overnight. It comes as a severe storm threat is issued across the north-central U.S.
CNN meteorologist Chad Myers with the forecast.
Chad.
CHAD MYERS, AMS METEOROLOGIST: John, over 150 severe wind reports yesterday. Some large hail. One tornado, but that was in Wyoming. No more weather for the northeast today. That's the good news.
This weather's brought to you by Tractor Supply Company, providing pet food, animal feed, and gardening supplies.
So, let's get to it.
Here's what happened yesterday. Storms rolled across New York City, rolled across Philadelphia, D.C. as well, (INAUDIBLE) there, especially to your west, over six inches of rainfall with these storms as they fired from the northwest and rolled to the southeast. That's where the flooding happened, Philadelphia and also down south of D.C.
Now, today, the weather will be Wyoming, Montana, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, will see weather up here again. This is what the radar is going to look like, very big weather today. Big cells. If you're flying across the country, you're not going to fly over these storms. They're going to be 55,000 feet tall. Your plane's not going to go that high.
Across the rest of the country, though, temperatures are going to be in the 70s-80s, about where we should be. 91 Kansas City. Feels a whole lot better than where you've been. Even Oklahoma City only in the upper 80s to lower 90s. Nowhere near approaching that 100-degree index -- that heat index that we've seen all weekend long. It was so brutal out there. Better today.
John.
BERMAN: We need it. It was too hot.
All right, Chad, thank you very much.
MYERS: You bet.
BERMAN: So, Georgia's governor deploying the National Guard after this big uptick in murders and violent crimes. What's behind the spikes that we're seeing in cities across the country? That's next.
[06:51:41]
CAMEROTA: Developing overnight, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp declaring a state of emergency and activating as many as 1,000 members of the National Guard following a spike in violence in Atlanta. A number of major cities in the U.S. saw a wave of violence over the holiday weekend. What is causing this?
Joining us now is CNN law enforcement analyst Charles Ramsey. He's the former Philadelphia police commissioner and former D.C. police chief.
Commissioner Ramsey, it's great to have you here. So, murders are up in something like 25 major cities, some more significant than others. According to ""The New York Times,"" in New York it's been nearly a quarter century since New York City experienced as much gun violence in the month of June as it has seen this year. And as we just said, in Atlanta, the homicides and gun violence have gone up so much that the governor has just declared a state of emergency.
What do you think is causing this?
CHARLES RAMSEY, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: Well, first of all, it is very troubling. I mean New York had two decades of steady declines in homicides, and now all of a sudden they're starting to see a spike. Many cities started to see spikes last year in shootings and homicides.
I don't know if there's any one thing that's really driving it. You'd have to do a pretty careful analysis. It could be gangs. It could be drugs. It could be early release of prisoners. I mean it could be a variety of things. Or just simply arguments that are taking place.
As far as Georgia goes, my understanding is the National Guard's going to back-fill positions to free up state police officers to assist with patrol in the city of Atlanta.
But this is very, very disturbing to see this trend start to occur, especially at this point in time where we're already dealing with Covid-19.
The thing to me, though, that's equally disappointing is the fact that I don't see the outrage that we should see in these communities around these murders, children being slain by stray bullets. I mean we've just gone through weeks and weeks of protests. And, rightfully so. Absolutely, rightfully so. The same level of outrage needs to be shown with these murders taking place in the community. Community members and community members killing one another. Until we get that level of outrage, it's not going to change. It's going to continue. Every year, 15,000 homicides in the United States. It's ridiculous.
CAMEROTA: Sometimes I hear people say, well, it's -- it's just gang violence. You know, it's a tick up in gang violence. As though that matters. I mean look at the victims just from this weekend.
RAMSEY: Yes.
CAMEROTA: Look at the children who were killed just this weekend. In Chicago, a seven-year-old girl playing with other children on the street. In Atlanta, an eight-year-old riding in a car with her mom. In Washington, D.C., an 11-year-old boy who had left his car to run into his relatives' house for a phone charger. I could go on and on.
RAMSEY: Right.
CAMEROTA: I mean if kids are being caught in the crossfire, what -- you know, sometimes people say, it's just gang violence, as though, well, it doesn't affect, you know, regular people. Yes, it does!
RAMSEY: It does. And, I mean, bullets don't have eyes. They'll strike anything in its path. And these kids are being struck down by stray bullets. You never know what's going to happen, where, when, and who's going to be impacted by it. Violence is violence. All lives matter when it comes to this sort of thing. You can't just say that, well, this shooting here that took place is wrong, so, you know, I'm going to be outraged and we're going to petition city hall and so forth.
[06:55:03]
We need the same level of outrage with the homicides that are taking place every single day in cities across America. And until that happens, it is not going to go away. Whether it's gang violence, drugs, it doesn't matter the motive, people are dying, needlessly dying on the streets of our city. And we need to do something about it. And it's got to be more than just what you hear people, they want to just kind of deflect it and say, well, we just need jobs or whatever.
We need short-term strategies. We need long-term strategies. We need to get serious about this. It's not going to fix itself.
CAMEROTA: Yes.
What are those short-term strategies? I mean, what would you, as police commissioner, do?
RAMSEY: Well, first thing I'd do is I would have a meeting not only with my own people to find out how we're deploying our own resources and what information we have about what's going on with these homicides. If you have someone in group ""a"" shoot someone from group ""b,"" it doesn't take a brain surgeon to figure out you're going to have retaliation. So who in group ""b"" is most likely to do that particular act? Not every kid in the gang, for an example, is violent, but some are very violent. Who are they? Where can we reach out and touch them to make sure that they're not going to go out there and do something stupid? Because every time you lose one life, you're actually losing two, the person that was murdered and the person that did the crime is going to spend the rest of their lives in jail.
Grab the community people, the leaders within the community, and sit down and talk about ways in which we can do things together in order to be able to identify the people causing harm out here in these communities. They're not coming from mars. These are folks that live right in the same neighborhood. People know who they are. We need to be able to build cases and get the violent criminals off the street. And until we do that -- and it's going to take cooperation of the community -- it's not going to change. And people think it's something magical that's going to happen. Oh, just throw some more jobs or just better education. We've got to do something now. All those things are important, but you need a short-term strategy to go along with it because people are dying every hour of every day in streets across America, and it doesn't make any sense.
CAMEROTA: Do you think that this is somehow related to the tension that has -- that we've all seen with the police since George Floyd's murder? Do you think that the police have somehow backed off?
RAMSEY: Yes.
CAMEROTA: Do you think that there's any connection?
RAMSEY: I think there's a possibility. I mean, listen, I mean I spent my entire adult life as a police officer. And I know what it takes to be out there on the street. You know, you're making a stop here and there with reasonable suspicion, trying to get guns off the street. You know, people don't want no police, they want constitutional policing, which is -- which is what they ought to have, irrespective of what may have gone on with those other cases that you particularly mentioned.
But police officers right now are a little reluctant, I think, to an extent, to be proactive in terms of being able to deal with this. They're going back to that wait for the 911 call and then respond to the scene. Not every officer, but some officers. And so I think that's part of the problem.
But, still, it's not just a police issue. This is a community issue. And only the community can really solve it if they want to do something about it. I mean you have to look at this thing from a variety of angles. It's not just about police. Are they being proactive? Are they not being proactive or whatever? What are the community members doing? We need to do it together. Everyone has a responsibility to stop the carnage that's taking place on the streets of our city.
And until that happens and we stop taking swings at one another, you know, defund the police, deband the police, and replace them with what? Who's going to go after these guys out here doing all these murders and shootings out here on the streets of our city? We need one another, but we've got to be able to sit down and come up with solutions. Police need to behave in a way in which is respectful toward a community. We need to have constitutional policing, can't violate people's rights for the sake of fighting crime. But community members have a responsibility, too, and our elected leaders have responsibility as well.
CAMEROTA: Yes.
RAMSEY: And so far, I think everybody's falling short.
CAMEROTA: Commissioner Charles Ramsey, thank you very much for all of your expertise with this.
RAMSEY: Thank you.
CAMEROTA: NEW DAY continues right now.

A10","Emma Teitel Toronto Star OPINION",NA,"You can be critical of Israel without being anti-Semitic",FALSE,"Setting aside the coronavirus, it's hard to think of an internet subject that's talked about more and understood less than the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I don't say this as an expert on the conflict myself - far from it - but as a left-leaning Jew who like many in my community has found herself recently in the painful position of having to tell some of her non-Jewish peers that though their criticism of the Jewish state is warranted, their delivery of that criticism is anti-Semitic. Exhibit A: I'm not an expert on Israel, but I do know that the people at its helm have neither the aim nor the mystical power to achieve world domination.
Yet this is the trope I see endorsed again and again on the social media pages of my peers, who in their mission to champion various political causes, have a tendency to champion anti-Semitic conspiracy theories in the same breath. These are theories about ""Zionist-controlled media,"" and a ""Zionist world order"" directing foreign governments and economies; theories similar to the kind expressed by DeSean Jackson this month, the NFL player who shared a quote on Instagram falsely attributed to Adolf Hitler suggesting Jews have a ""plan for world domination"" and that they will ""blackmail America."" Jackson has since apologized for the post, but his actions are not unique or isolated.
Exhibit B: you may have read recently about a Toronto restaurant owner whose criticism of Israel on Instagram veered into ugly, anti-Semitic tropes about Zionist control of media and elected officials, and ""genocidal Zionists that interfere with our democracy."" The shop owner appears to be on the receiving end of hate-filled censure as a result of her remarks, a reaction that must also be acknowledged and condemned. But it was again painful for me, and Jews like me, to see non-Jews we know and respect endorse the shop owner's position, or worse, repost some of the same anti-Semitic canards on social media. This is especially so for those of us who are angry about the Israeli government's West Bank annexation plan and outspoken about it.
Some of you reading this might also be tempted to counter that sharing content about ""Zionist control"" or ""a Zionist world order"" isn't anti-Semitic, because Zionism doesn't equal Judaism. But this position is a semantic fallacy. Zionism in modern Jewish terms is synonymous with a belief that the state of Israel has a right to exist. By this definition a great many Jews today are Zionists. When an activist group or a shop owner or whoever attaches anti-Semitic tropes to an adjective, Zionist, that millions of Jews wear, they're engaging in anti-Semitism plain and simple.
Ergo, if you want us to stop flagging criticism of Israel as anti-Semitism, stop framing your criticism in poisonous, creaky myths that suggest Jews - sorry, Zionists - are all-knowing masterminds of, say, the economy. (I personally have trouble logging in to my online banking account.)
These Zionist/Jewish tropes have real world consequences. Not only did they fuel the pogroms of eastern Europe and the Holocaust, we've seen them trotted out on both sides of the political spectrum in recent years, by members of the U.K. Labour Party and by the president of the United States. The man who murdered 11 Jews at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018 was a big fan of such theories. According to the Anti-Defamation League, anti-Semitic incidents in the U.S. hit an all-time high last year, ""with more than 2,100 acts of assault, vandalism and harassment"" reported across the country. In 2019, more than half the hate crimes in New York City targeted Jews.
Others reading this column might argue that there is more anti-Semitism on the right, (a la frequent allusions to George Soros), so why even bother mentioning it on the left? The answer is that anti-Semitism is worth mentioning wherever it exists. If our goal is to erode hate everywhere, we must condemn it everywhere, even and especially in our own communities.
At its core, anti-Semitism is a conspiracy theory about Jews wielding outsized power in secret. And conspiracy theories, as you may have noticed, are having a bit of a moment. A Carleton University study from May this year found that nearly half of all Canadians believe at least one coronavirus conspiracy theory (and yes, there is a theory circulating that COVID-19 is a ""Zionist plot."")
This is why confronting anti-Semitism isn't merely a moral imperative. It's a civic one too. When you confront anti-Semitism you aren't just confronting hatred; you're confronting the spread of misinformation and paranoid thinking. You're encouraging critical thinking among your like-minded peers, and promoting democracy for all groups.
My goal in the end isn't to argue a position in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but to make a suggestion about how we argue. If the conflict is new territory for you, please take the time to do some research before you post about it to social media. (Googling ""anti-Semitic canards"" is a good first step.)
If you do post something critical about Israel to social media, please refrain from assigning to its citizens conspiratorial superpowers that they do not possess. And if you see a friend or a colleague entertaining the notion that they do: speak up.
Your democracy and your conscience will thank you.

116,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1251/Files (250).DOCX","MSNBC POLITICS NATION 5:00 PM EST",2020-11-21,"6370 words","NEWS; Domestic","Al Sharpton, Richard Lui",NA,"POLITICSNATION for November 21, 2020",FALSE,"AL SHARPTON, MSNBC HOST, POLITICSNATION: Good evening and welcome to POLITICSNATION.
Tonight`s lead: war games.
On any other post-election show in late November, I would at least be able to give thanks for the seamless transition of power that has been a constant here in America since its founding.
But this holiday week, we find ourselves in unfamiliar and uneasy territory because right now, the nation reels from a raging pandemic that has infected more than 12 million Americans and claimed more than a quarter million American lives and our current President Donald Trump has no intention of containing it.
And that`s because this American carnage has taken a backseat in his mind to an obsession with a multi-pronged strategy, in part to undermine President-elect Joe Biden and cast doubt on our democracy and institutions. That is the war.
And also our last desperate ploy, in a long con to keep himself and his family out of prison when he is a civilian again, that`s the game.
The legal fights this week personified by the President`s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, trying to make some kind of conspiracy theory stick and literally melting under the scrutiny of even conservatives who chose to do their jobs and not undo the will of nearly 80 million Americans.
It`s comforting to think that reality and rule of law will prevail in these times. And yes, the steps remain in place for Trump to be removed. But we should not just speculate about the potential consequences of Trump`s cynical war against a free and fair election he lost and face the fact that some of the damage has already been done because this week, Michigan Republicans willingly traveled to Washington at the President`s request, knowing they would be asked to go against the will of the people and flip the state at the President`s behest.
They ultimately ended up blowing his mind with five words he is not used to hearing from Republicans, quote, ""We will follow the law."" And yet, the very fact those law makers took the time to humor the President, and so many other elected Republicans remain silent in the face of his baseless claims, means millions of Trump supporters will continue to treat his conflict as a real thing when Trump himself knows it`s a ruse.
So we start in Michigan. Joining me now, Senator Debbie Stabenow. First, thank you for being with us, Senator.
SEN. DEBBIE STABENOW (D-MI): Absolutely, Rev. It`s always wonderful to be with you.
SHARPTON: Now, Senator, the President and the G.O.P. has continued to build their voter fraud claims largely around the idea that the vote in Democratic heavily black cities cannot be trusted. With Michigan this week and throughout the election, it has been Detroit.
Now black voters nationwide offended as we`ve been for four years, but in Michigan, where racial tensions have been uniquely high this year and preyed on by the President again and again, explain the damage done to your state, Madam Senator.
STABENOW: Reverend Al, there is a lot of damage being done and first, let me start by saying Joe Biden and Kamala Harris won Michigan by over 150,000 votes, which is 14 times more than Donald Trump won Michigan four years ago.
It was accurate, transparent, every single county, 83 counties have all certified the vote and so we know what they are doing. You know what they`re doing. Everyone knows that this is about undermining confidence, undermining our democracy, and frankly, it`s dangerous. It`s pathetic and it is racist, because we all know when you are focusing on Detroit 80 percent of our citizens are African-Americans, everybody knows what they are doing.
So Monday, the State Board of Canvassers has to certify the vote. It`s a very simple ministerial process. You know, there`s not judgment involved. There`s not politics involved, you have to just certify what has been done in Michigan and we expect that they will. And if not, we know that we`re going to make sure that this vote gets certified in Michigan.
SHARPTON: Yes. Now, the frustration that I have and so many of us in the civil rights community, from all kinds of organizations, the crew now at the National Action Network, Reverend Charles Williams right there in Michigan, went out and did hard work to get people to come out to vote in a nonpartisan way, telling people even if you`re not voting for people that we made, like, please vote, we must use our vote, and record numbers of voters came out.
And now to have those votes discredited to give people that were cynical and saying my vote doesn`t count, to even give them the suggestion that that could have happened by some of these Michigan State officials, even going to humor the President is running counter to what so many people work so hard to tell people to go out and vote, create your own reality by standing up for what you believe. It is just counterproductive and really undermines the democratic principles of the country.
STABENOW: Reverend Al, it really does, and particularly in a year when we worked so hard, and by the way, Reverend Williams used to work for me as part of my political team. And so, he and so many people have worked so hard, and we had the highest voter turnout ever, higher than 2008 with President Obama, five and a half million people showed up and showed up on both sides, by the way, although our side just showed up much more and it was a lot of people who believe that that their vote was important that it mattered, and that it would be counted.
And I think one of the things that is important to look at right now happening in Michigan is that last week when Wayne County Board of Electors, you know, had originally said the two Republicans said they weren`t going to certify the results. There was such an outcry, such a huge outcry, I think they really didn`t understand. They were very naive about what they thought they could do to undermine democracy.
But ultimately, they certified because people engaged, and so what we`re seeing now, is that we`re saying to people, we`re working all this weekend, you know, we can`t stop now, we have to remain engaged until the vote is certified and it is recognized who voters voted for, and that was Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
SHARPTON: Now, in addition, I must raise this in addition to this, we saw the plot that we all knew about that a group of white supremacist terrorists allegedly planned to kidnap and kill your state`s governor earlier this year. But we learned from prosecutors in that case, that there were at least two backup plans: one, to storm the State Capitol with 200 armed combatants, who would then execute lawmakers on camera for a week.
The other Plan C would have been just to burn the building down with lawmakers inside. No survivors.
I`ve asked this before. What does Michigan need from President-elect Biden on his watch to combat the rise of this kind of terror, which your state has been dealing with uniquely for decades now?
STABENOW: Yes, this has been just horrible what has happened, and I think we will see. I have great confidence in President-elect Biden, and I think we need multiple things.
First, we need what he is already doing, which is trying to calm down and focus people on the threat right in front of us, which is COVID-19, which we all know, the case is going through the roof, the deaths going through the roof, and we need to help people right now.
What we ought to be doing is a survival package that`s going to help people get through this. The vaccines are positive news, but we are a long way from being in a spot where everyone is going to be able to get access to the vaccines, which is by the way, I would say as an aside, Reverend Al, which is why these two Senate races in Georgia are important and I believe we`re going to win there.
I really believe that people are going to turn out and we`re going to win and why is that important? Because we have to hit the ground running with the new President and Vice President to actually help people with healthcare and COVID-19.
So that has to happen, and then I think we have to have a President who is focused on the rule of law, basics about holding people accountable when they do the kinds of things that we have uncovered in Michigan.
Bringing people together, there`s a lot of work, a lot of work that has to go on. I`m very, very concerned when we see the divided country, the number of people who voted for Donald Trump, even in spite of everything or because of everything he has done, whatever.
The reality is, we have so much work to do to try to bring people together in a country that has been so divided, but I believe that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, have the right people for this moment. I really do.
We`ve just got to get through to January, add two new Democratic senators from Georgia and then we move forward.
SHARPTON: All right. Well, as always, it`s a pleasure to have had you with us this evening. Thank you, Senator Stabenow.
Joining me now is Congresswoman Val Demings, Democrat of Florida. Good to see you, Congresswoman, and have you with us again this evening.
REP. VAL DEMINGS (D-FL): Great to see you Reverend Sharpton. Good to be back with you.
SHARPTON: Now, earlier this week, the Congressional Black Caucus led by the incoming Biden White House adviser, Cedric Richmond, criticized G.O.P. senators Mitch McConnell in particular, for holding up additional COVID relief under the Heroes Act, which passed in the House nearly five months ago. The C.D.C. says it needs to happen by Christmas.
What kind of pain are you anticipating in your Orlando district? And what can the C.D.C. do the count of the G.O.P.?
DEMINGS: Well, you know, look, Representative Richmond was spot on in his assessment there. You`re right, it has been five months. We have a bill that would bring much needed relief, and what it will do, it is within its name. That`s why it`s called the Heroes Act, and it has been sitting on Mitch McConnell`s desk, waiting for a vote. Just bring it to the floor for a vote. Vote it up or down.
But people are hurting. You know, here in Orlando, tourism is really the force that drives our economy. Our theme parks are operated at very low capacity. They`ve laid off thousands of individuals. Our Convention Center is closed down.
We have people who -- some whose have to go to work, because they work in the healthcare field or other places where they can, stay home and shelter in place and still get paid, and so people are hurting.
We have small businesses that are closing down, minority business, as you can imagine, are most impacted. We need to get them some relief. And we can do this Reverend Sharpton before Christmas, if Mitch McConnell has the political will and remembers why he is there in the first place and that`s to help the American people.
SHARPTON: And I do know that people in Orlando and your district know you fight for them. My father lives in that district. I`m a Jesse Jackson Democrat. He is a Val Demings Democrat, but moving on.
What is ironic to me is that we look at the fact that we hear the rightwing talk about, oh, put Christmas back in. Don`t call it a Happy Holidays, call it Christmas. But what kind of Christ do they believe in that won`t even give relief to people who don`t know how they will make it because they`ve been suffering and the Heroes Act has been passed. They just won`t bring it through the Senate with their conservative man, Mitch McConnell who is the one that is in charge and could put that bill out there and get it passed.
DEMINGS: Reverend Sharpton, the bottom line is, we know them by the fruit that they bear. And if they can sleep at night, knowing that 250,000 families as we approach Thanksgiving and the Christmas Season will have an empty chair at the dinner table. If they can sleep with themselves knowing that over 11 million people in this country have been directly impacted by the virus.
If they can sleep with themselves knowing that businesses are shutting their doors for good, then, you know, I believe that -- I heard the Senator before me talk about Georgia, the optimism about Georgia. Well, I do believe we need to do everything we can to get those two senatorial candidates elected so we can get people in the Senate, who really remember why they are there and vote those who do not out.
SHARPTON: Now, let me ask you this, as the Biden transition team takes shape, it is already on track to become the most diverse ever assembled. According to VOX this weekend, 46 percent of Biden`s transition staffers are of color. That includes 41 percent of the senior staff, 52 percent are women and that includes 53 percent of the senior staff.
And as the President-elect plots his cost economically through the pandemic, he has appointed several key advisers on rooting out systemic racism in our economy. What does this signal to you about the grasp of this particular moment? And have you been asked to come join his team, Madam Congresswoman?
DEMINGS: Well, Reverend Sharpton, let me say this, I am so excited about the possibilities under a Biden-Harris administration and what I so appreciate, you know, President-elect Biden said several things along the campaign trail, and how familiar are we with people who say one thing and do another.
But from the time he said, I will appoint a woman to stand beside me to the agenda that he has put together and the people that he selected in his Cabinet. He made a statement that Americans have a duty to act to address systemic racism, and he is putting people in place that will help him do just that.
Well, we will really start at the beginning, looking at racism in this country, and how we got to the place where we are, and then implement programs to not only address systemic racism in one system, but in all systems. I`m truly excited about that.
The second part of your question, look, I want to -- you know, I love serving people. Your dad is a very smart man, a very wise man. I love serving people. I want to be in the place where I can best serve the Biden- Harris agenda.
If that is staying in the House, I`m going to stay in the House; if that`s going in another direction, then I`m going to do that. But what I do know is that I`m going to do everything in my power to push this agenda that directly impacts people who look like me forward.
SHARPTON: All right, and we`re going to be there pushing with everyone else to make sure that promises made are promises kept, and I`m sure that the President-elect and Vice President-elect will be meeting with the C.D.C. and Civil Rights leaders and activist groups, because they`re hearing everybody and we intend to be heard, and you always made yourself heard.
Thank you, Congresswoman Val Demings.
DEMINGS: Thank you so much, Rev. Take care. Stay safe.
SHARPTON: You as well. With cases of coronavirus spiking all over the United States, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is raising the alarm that the Trump administration`s vaccine rollout plan could leave behind those communities hit hardest by the virus.
On this show last week, Governor Cuomo threatened legal action if the plan isn`t overall; to better include black and brown folks living in urban America.
Joining me now is Randall Woodfin, the Mayor of Birmingham Alabama, a majority black city. Thank you, Mr. Mayor, for being with us.
MAYOR RANDALL WOODFIN (D), BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA: Thank you, Rev for having me on.
SHARPTON: Now cases in Alabama are spiking along with the rest of the country. How concerned are you about the most marginalized folks in Birmingham in the lead up to a vaccine being made available, as we`re now being told could be possible?
WOODFIN: Reverend, I am as concerned now as I was as early as March of 2020. I often have to remind people that the City of Birmingham is 75 percent black. It is the fourth largest city in America. In addition to that, unfortunately, we have a concentration of poverty here that is higher than it should be, not to mention too many people have preexisting conditions.
When you add all of that together with the rapid pace and speed of how the coronavirus is traveling in this second wave, I`m extremely concerned and you know, I`m appreciative of the Governor now having the statewide face cover ordinance, but that`s not good enough.
We need to make sure at all levels, municipal, state level and 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, we are doing everything we can to protect people, especially the vulnerable.
SHARPTON: Now, you have -- and many in elected office and many of us that are not that have public platforms have the dual problem of one, making sure that if a vaccine does come about, that it is distributed in areas that have desert areas when it comes to health services, and convincing a lot of people in the community once we`ve convinced ourselves that the vaccine is fine to take or that it is not something that we`ve experienced in our own history in the black community like the Tuskegee experiment.
So in one hand, we`ve got to know that this is real, and that it is something that is -- something we could endorse for people to take, and then we have to make sure it`s available, which gives you a double problem that many mayors will not have to face in this country.
WOODFIN: This is a problem I`m ready to take on because it`s going to require leadership. You`re right Reverend, the City of Birmingham is not too far from Tuskegee, and 2020 is not too far from the history of the Tuskegee experiment, where we know when you speed up dates, there is mistrust. There is no trust, there is distrust.
That being the case, as Mayor of Birmingham, I am happy to have partnered with University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital, as well as their Dean of School of Medicine, Dr. Vickers as well as their CEO of their Health Systems, Dr. Will Ferniany where the City of Birmingham jointly with the UAB as well as Jersey County Health Department have had a unified front in communicating to our residents, the steps needed to take for our residents to protect themselves.
This vaccine comes available, the thing I will have to do is put myself out in front of my residents to show that this vaccine will not be harmful to you, and that you can trust it, and that we need to have -- make sure it`s administered to those who need it the most and who are vulnerable.
That being the case is going to require an overwhelming amount of communication to build trust in the community.
SHARPTON: Now the Trump administration is refusing to allow Joe Biden and his transition team access to critical information, including vaccination plans and data. As a practical matter, how is this kind of delay going to impact your constituents in Birmingham?
WOODFIN: This delay is up there with stupid, it`s up there with dumb, it`s up there with just malpractice as it relates to conduct unbecoming of a sitting President. It doesn`t matter if you won or did not win. The case we are right now, all of us as elected officials, and again, at every level, we have one job and one priority, and that is to save lives.
And democracy works this way. If you lose, you`re still in a position to not only continue to lead until your last day of office, which is supposed to set a bridge to transfer power as well as information to the next administration.
What I`m saying, it saddens me, it disappoints me, but it also makes me mad, because it doesn`t -- this virus is not about Democrat or Republican. It`s not about black or white. It`s not about rich or poor. It is really about are we as leaders in this country doing everything we can to protect lives?
I`m going to do my part as Mayor to protect the lives of people who are from and live in Birmingham. But I have higher expectation of an outgoing President to do more and stop acting the way he is. Period.
SHARPTON: I`m going to have to leave it there. Thank you, as always, Mayor Woodfin for being with us.
WOODFIN: Thank you, Rev.
SHARPTON: Coming up, while America was focused on the election and Trump`s attempts to undermine it, you may have missed updates on some of the biggest racial justice cases underway across the country.
We`ll fill you in next, but first my colleague, Richard Louis with today`s top news stories -- Richard.
RICHARD LUI, MSNBC CORRESPONDENT: Thanks, Rev and a very good day to you. The stories we`re watching for you this hour, coronavirus hits yet another milestone.
The total number of cases across the U.S. now topping 12 million. The death toll is over 256,000. The C.D.C. warns Americans to stay home for Thanksgiving meanwhile, to not host large gatherings with loved ones this year.
South Dakota now has the country`s second highest rate of infection as one example. Hospital capacity there remains strained. Total confirmed cases surpasses 66,000.
Today, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in Qatar. He met this morning with Taliban and Afghan teams to discuss regional peace. That trip is part of a push from the Trump administration to achieve foreign policy objectives before January`s change of power.
More POLITICSNATION with Reverend Al Sharpton right after the break.
SHARPTON: This part of the show where I usually do my Memo to Trump, but he lost and even if he is petulantly refusing to start the transition process, here at POLITICSNATION, we are already transitioning away from him.
Today, we start that with a segment called ""While you were voting."" It`s been a wild couple of months. Many of you waited hours in line to have your votes counted, or navigated a confusing mail-in ballot process only to be glued to the news for days until a winner was announced.
So it makes sense that some racial justice news slipped below the radar. But don`t worry, I`m here for you with some updates.
We`ll start with the case of 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery, the unarmed black man chased down and allegedly shot by two white men in Georgia. The bond hearing for the two men revealed the oldest suspect had a previous relationship with the Deputy Chief Assistant District Court Attorney who had original jurisdiction in the case, and he called her in an apparent attempt to intervene in the case. The Judge denied bond for both suspects and no trial date has yet been set.
Meanwhile, another grand juror from the Breonna Taylor case has come forward to condemn the grand jury process. The jury repeated allegations that the Kentucky Attorney General did not allow them to consider charges against some of the officers involving and executing the no knock warrant and firing shots that killed Breonna Taylor in her own apartment.
And in the case of George Floyd, the Minneapolis man who was suffocated by a police officer who held his knee on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Well, according to prosecutors, that officer had a pattern of such behavior. Video footage from 2017 shows the same officer kneeling on the back of a 14-year-old boy and ignoring the child as he begged for breath. That case is set to go to trial in March.
These three cases are just a small fraction of the news that happened while we were trying desperately to save our democracy. But this snapshot is a telling summary of the state of racial justice in this country, or perhaps more accurately racial injustice.
The F.B.I. just released its annual hate crimes report, which found bias motivated killing were up a record high last year, the third consecutive year in more than 7,000 hate crime incidents.
Many of these vile acts are no doubt fueled by the climate of intolerance, encouraged by a President with apparent white nationalist sympathies.
But they don`t end when he is out of office, especially if that soon to be ex-President continues to scapegoat communities of color for his loss.
So while we may be phasing out our Memo to Trump, we won`t stop calling out the American hate he did not create, but certainly did propagate during his time on the national stage, no doubt about it.
When we come back, the next chapter in the fight for racial justice in the United States.
SHARPTON: According to a new F.B.I. report, 2019 had the highest number of hate crimes in over a decade. In well over half of those incidents, victims were targeted for their race or ethnicity. Twenty percent were targeted for their religious beliefs, and nearly 17 percent for their sexual orientation.
The report also found that the offenses were more violent than in previous years, and marked a third straight year with more than 7,000 hate driven incidents.
Joining me now is Brian Levin, Director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University in San Bernardino. Let me ask you, Brian, according to the F.B.I. report, only about 2000 law enforcement agencies even reported their hate crime data in 2019 out of more than 15,000 such agencies nationwide.
How much does something like that skew this data, meaning it could be a lot even higher in the number of incidents?
BRIAN LEVIN, DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HATE AND EXTREMISM, CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY IN SAN BERNARDINO: Oh, absolutely, Reverend. And I think it`s important to recognize that while we are looking at a mystery fraudulent votes that don`t exist, the real fraud that`s going on, look at Alabama. It reported zero hate crimes last year. Zero.
I will fly to Alabama on my own dime to train the major Police Departments, many of which reported zero. So when we look at the states, for instance, Mississippi, Alabama and other states that have high percentages of African-Americans who remain the most targeted at double their representation of the population. That`s one area where we know we`re getting undercounts.
You know even out here in California, Anaheim reported zero, that`s not true. What else do we see? Other cities. Philadelphia only reported 12, for instance. Your earlier data showed 35.
And one other quick thing Rev, New Jersey in October, we had a state report that said there were about a thousand hate crimes, the F.B.I. said there were 472. So if we just look at like New Jersey, and some of these cities alone, Chicago. Chicago gave us a hundred hate crime incidents, yet only about 39 to 40 showed up in the F.B.I. reports.
So what I`m saying to you is, if these disparities were cleared up, we could have perhaps double or triple of the percentage increase that we saw.
SHARPTON: And the ones that we saw are the highest that we`ve seen.
LEVIN: Yes.
SHARPTON: Let me bring this to you. The United Nations released a report detailing the rise of hate crimes in the United States, specifically pointing to the President`s quote, ""legitimizing of anti-Asian rhetoric and racist actions."" Do you expect the 2020 F.B.I. report to be even worse? And where do we go from here, Brian?
LEVIN: Oh, great, great question, Reverend. Actually, interestingly enough, for anti-Asian for 2020, we are seeing a big spike in many of the major cities. And in New York, we actually saw a slight increase in hate crimes against African-Americans in 2020.
But we have a really interesting split. Some cities are showing increases for instance, LA, Phoenix, Houston, San Antonio, but a lot of places are reporting much lower. And here`s why.
While residences are the number one target, if you combine all the public gathering spaces, which had been restricted somewhat, that`s going to have us kind of in the eye of the storm for 2020. But 2019 was the worst year since 2008.
And listen to this, the worst months over the last decade, all revolved around politics and all over the last few years, Charlottesville, August 2017; election month 2016; and October 2018 were the worst ones for hate crime this past decade.
And we saw an increase, for instance, if you look at over the five years, when hate crimes bottomed in the Obama administration in a 30-year run on, we`re seeing double digit percentage increases in aggravated assaults.
Look at this. Look at this. Homicide. Look at that. Homicide, straight line.
SHARPTON: So the end going all the way up shows how we`ve seen this increase. Let me push you on the way you talked about the --
LEVIN: ... the people here and that`s homicides. That`s how many homicides we`re seeing coming out. Look at that, they almost have a monopoly on them, on extremist homicides.
So we really have to change some stuff. We need legislation. The George Lloyd Act, the John Lewis Voting Act, although I`d love it to be called the John Lewis Reverend Vivian -- because he was a wonderful person in my life -- Act.
Well, and also here in California Assemblymember Bloom is looking to make a permanent state commission so that we don`t have this subject to various vagaries. But this is in across many things. Look at COVID, we have over twice as many deaths --
SHARPTON: And one of the places we need to go, as you said, and we`ve been dealing with it on this show, we had a couple of hundred thousand -- we marched about it, the George Floyd Act and others. We need legislation.
But let me raise this to you when you mentioned that it saw the spikes in political years, President Trump`s supporters have taken to the streets since the election. We`ve seen protests like this one today in Atlanta, where mostly white demonstrators echo Trump`s claim the results were somehow fraudulent. Because of nefarious activities in Democratic cities, with large minority populations. Are you worried that anger we are seeing right now could eventually spur new waves of hate crime?
LEVIN: Yes. And what we are seeing are these massacres that are taking place which are actually affecting the overall numbers. Mark my words, we`re going to see an insurgency. How hot it gets, it is going to be interesting.
But if you look at this, the 70s when, for instance, the progressives were kind of voted out of the presidency, we saw a shift over to violence, and I think we`re seeing that now with the hard right.
And the other thing, what a disgrace. What a disgrace where we are having black people who are not being allowed to vote because of various restrictions, and that`s why we need to have these Voting Rights Act passed. We need the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department reinvigorate, the Community Relations Service.
And I`ll tell you something, Val Demings, I testified before Congress, I got questioned by her, she would be a wonderful choice for so many slots in this current administration.
SHARPTON: All right, Brian Levin, thanks for being with us.
Let me say during the time of social justice reckoning for our country, Americans nationwide have call for the removal of Confederate statues in Washington as a response.
Lawmakers included a bipartisan provision in the Annual Defense Bill to rename several military bases that are named after Confederate leaders. But as the deadline looms to finalize the bill, President Trump has made it clear that he will veto it if the bases are to be renamed.
Now some Republicans are following suit and want to remove the provision creating the dangerous possibility of a delayed Defense Bill, the first time in over 60 years.
Joining me now is Democratic Congressman of Maryland, Anthony Brown. Thank you for being with us again, Congressman Brown.
REP. ANTHONY BROWN (D-MD): Reverend Sharpton, it is great to be on with you particularly to talk about this important issue.
SHARPTON: Now, you are leading the effort on the Hill to keep the provision in. Why are some of your Republican colleagues changing their minds now about keeping the base names for Confederates the same or name on a base?
BROWN: Like so many things we`ve seen time and time again in Washington, it comes down to the opposition of one person and that`s President Trump. Republicans overwhelmingly in the United States Senate, along with Democrats, as well as Republicans and Democrats in the House of Representatives voted to mandate the removal of the Confederate names from our military installations within a time certain.
Donald Trump threatened to veto the Defense Authorization Act if that provision remains. So a number of Republicans have backpedaled. We cannot pass the Defense Authorization Act without the mandatory removal.
This is more than symbolic. This is about whether we perpetuate the historic wrongs of celebrating and honoring Confederate traitors who represented hatred and division and who stood for the institution they fought and were willing to die for slavery.
In fact, had they been successful, whether it was General Benning or Bragg or Rucker, not only would I not have been able to serve in the military, I certainly would not be a Member of Congress today.
This is an important moment for Congress. We cannot walk away from this.
The Defense Authorization Act should pass, but it must pass with a provision that mandates the removal of these names.
SHARPTON: So let me make this clear for our viewers, they are expecting blacks and others to go and serve on bases that is named in honor of people that fought to have them enslaved, have no rights that anyone was bound to respect and ignore that. That is not symbolic, that is as offensive as you could get.
And you would think in this summer of reckoning that we`ve had since George Floyd, that this would be the time that everyone would stand up across both aisles and say, yes, we cannot honor people that stood for racism and treason. These are people that led an insurrection against the United States government that they are elected to the body, and this president said he would veto it. And some of your colleagues are saying, let`s take that provision out.
BROWN: Absolutely. Look, 43 percent of the men and women who serve in uniform are black and brown. They are African-American, Latino, our Asian brothers and sisters, and to have this perpetuated division and hatred and racism symbolized by these Confederate names, and it`s not just the bases, there are buildings and barracks, and there are roads and streets on military property.
And here`s the thing, Reverend Sharpton, military leadership, they have supported the removal of these names because they know that it has a negative impact on the morale of today`s soldiers.
The leadership at The Pentagon supports this. Forty nine percent of the men and women in uniform support this while only 37 oppose this.
This is bigger than the military. This is about American values. There`s absolutely no way that we can pass the Defense Authorization Act without removing this because as you mentioned, Reverend Sharpton, one of the defining moments of this year in this country, culminating a defining attention and conflict for decades in this nation and has been a reckoning with race.
If we can`t do this this year, then when are we going to do it?
SHARPTON: Now in July, NBC News polled that 51 percent of Americans said their Confederate statues and monuments should be removed. But 47 percent said they should stay there. What do you make of that?
BROWN: Look, what I make of that is that there are some who believe that having Confederate names or any names on a military installation should remain the same. Perhaps it recognizes our history. It is tradition.
And the response is that we can remember our history. Who has gone to forget the six million Africans and their families who were enslaved in this country? Who is going to forget the 1.5 million Americans who died in the Civil War on both sides, military and civilian? Who is going to forget that our Union almost crumbled, because there were men and people who were willing to fight and die for slavery?
Remembering our history is one thing, we should not be honoring and celebrating, particularly those who in a very treacherous and traitorous way led the Confederacy.
SHARPTON: Do you believe that you can win this fight to keep that provision in and if this President vetoes it, that it would have a devastating impact on defense and hold this country vulnerable because of the bigotry of this sitting President?
BROWN: Absolutely. There are plenty of important provisions that are in the Defense Authorization Act, in addition to needing to remove Confederate names from our bases. I mean, this is how we take care of soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines with their pay raise and supporting family housing. This is how we ensure readiness and modernizing our military.
So the President needs to be sent the bill with the removal, and if he chooses to veto it, then Congress has the ability to override it, but we need to send him a Defense Authorization Act. It needs to include the provision to remove the names of Confederate traitors on military installations, and if the President vetoes it, Congress needs to override that veto.
SHARPTON: All right, Congressman Anthony Brown. Thanks for being with us tonight. And by the way, Happy Birthday. You didn`t know I knew. Happy birthday.
BROWN: Thanks a lot, Reverend Sharpton. Thank you.
SHARPTON: All right, up next, my final thoughts. Stay with us.
SHARPTON: Recent reporting from ""The New York Times"" suggests that around 700,000 Georgians have already requested their absentee ballots for the January Senate runoff election.
I hope that all Georgians come out and vote when early voting starts, vote early. Vote on January 5th, the future of the U.S. senate and whether or not Mitch McConnell is Majority Leader, or Minority Leader will be decided by this election.
And let me say this Thursday, many of us around the country celebrate Thanksgiving Day. Because of the pandemic, it has been advised, don`t travel. Don`t have large gatherings. Please listen to the health experts.
We love our families. We certainly love grandma. But don`t put grandma at risk. Don`t put family members at risk.
One of the ways you can show thanks to God is by appreciating the expertise given us so that we can protect all of God`s children. And yes, as we are in this Holiday week, we face many challenges, the pandemic, racial intolerance, justice issues, and economic disparities.
But we should thank God we have the mind and many of us the ability to fight those fights.
I praise Thanksgiving, remembering the old gospel song, ""Lord, if you choose not to move my mountains, just give me the strength to keep climbing.""
I`ll be right back.
SHARPTON: That is it for me. Thanks for watching. I`ll see you back here tomorrow at 5:00 p.m. Eastern.
Up next, my colleague Alicia Menendez picks about news coverage.

117,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1251/Files (250).DOCX","The Toronto Star",2020-07-10,"906 words","OPINION; Pg. 0","Emma Teitel",NA,"Emma Teitel: Confronting anti-Semitism isn't merely a moral imperative, it's a civic one too",FALSE,"Setting aside the coronavirus, it's hard to think of an Internet subject that's talked about more and understood less than the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I don't say this as an expert on the conflict myself - far from it - but as a left-leaning Jew who like many in my community has found herself recently in the painful position of having to tell some of her non-Jewish peers that though their criticism of the Jewish state is warranted, their delivery of that criticism is anti-Semitic. Exhibit A: I'm not an expert on Israel, but I do know that the people at its helm have neither the aim nor the mystical power to achieve world domination.
Yet this is the trope I see endorsed again and again on the social media pages of my peers, who in their mission to champion various political causes, have a tendency to champion anti-Semitic conspiracy theories in the same breath. These are theories about ""Zionist-controlled media,"" and a ""Zionist world order"" directing foreign governments and economies; theories similar to the kind expressed by DeSean Jackson this month, the NFL player who shared a quote on Instagram falsely attributed to Adolf Hitler suggesting Jews have a ""plan for world domination"" and that they will ""blackmail America."" Jackson has since apologized for the post, but his actions are not unique or isolated.
Exhibit B: you may have read recently about a Toronto restaurant owner whose criticism of Israel on Instagram veered into ugly, anti-Semitic tropes about Zionist control of media and elected officials, and ""genocidal Zionists that interfere with our democracy."" The shop owner appears to be on the receiving end of hate-filled censure as a result of her remarks, a reaction that must also be acknowledged and condemned. But it was again painful for me, and Jews like me, to see non-Jews we know and respect endorse the shop owner's position, or worse, repost some of the same anti-Semitic canards on social media. This is especially so for those of us who are angry about the Israeli government's West Bank annexation plan and outspoken about it.
Some of you reading this might also be tempted to counter that sharing content about ""Zionist control"" or ""a Zionist world order"" isn't anti-Semitic, because Zionism doesn't equal Judaism. But this position is a semantic fallacy. Zionism in modern Jewish terms is synonymous with a belief that the state of Israel has a right to exist. By this definition a great many Jews today are Zionists. When an activist group or a shop owner or whoever attaches anti-Semitic tropes to an adjective, Zionist, that millions of Jews wear, they're engaging in anti-Semitism plain and simple.
Ergo, if you want us to stop flagging criticism of Israel as anti-Semitism, stop framing your criticism in poisonous, creaky myths that suggest Jews - sorry, Zionists - are all-knowing masterminds of, say, the economy. (I personally have trouble logging in to my online banking account.)
These Zionist/Jewish tropes have real world consequences. Not only did they fuel the pogroms of eastern Europe and the Holocaust, we've seen them trotted out on both sides of the political spectrum in recent years, by members of the U.K. Labour Party and by the president of the United States. The man who murdered 11 Jews at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018 was a big fan of such theories. According to the Anti-Defamation League, anti-Semitic incidents in the U.S. hit an all-time high last year, ""with more than 2,100 acts of assault, vandalism and harassment"" reported across the country. In 2019, more than half the hate crimes in New York City targeted Jews.
Others reading this column might argue that there is more anti-Semitism on the right, (a la frequent allusions to George Soros), so why even bother mentioning it on the left? The answer is that anti-Semitism is worth mentioning wherever it exists. If our goal is to erode hate everywhere, we must condemn it everywhere, even and especially in our own communities.
At its core, anti-Semitism is a conspiracy theory about Jews wielding outsized power in secret. And conspiracy theories, as you may have noticed, are having a bit of a moment. A Carleton University study from May this year found that nearly half of all Canadians believe at least one coronavirus conspiracy theory (and yes, there is a theory circulating that COVID-19 is a ""Zionist plot."")
This is why confronting anti-Semitism isn't merely a moral imperative. It's a civic one too. When you confront anti-Semitism you aren't just confronting hatred; you're confronting the spread of misinformation and paranoid thinking. You're encouraging critical thinking among your like-minded peers, and promoting democracy for all groups.
My goal in the end isn't to argue a position in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but to make a suggestion about how we argue. If the conflict is new territory for you, please take the time to do some research before you post about it to social media. (Googling ""anti-Semitic canards"" is a good first step.) If you do post something critical about Israel to social media, please refrain from assigning to its citizens conspiratorial superpowers that they do not possess. And if you see a friend or a colleague entertaining the notion that they do: speak up. Your democracy and your conscience will thank you.

It's been an intense week of protests against police brutality here in the U.S. and around the world. It's hard to make sense of this current moment, but we'll help you through it. This week,we have an analysis[1]from our CEO Susan Smith Richardson, a closer look at police unions and what's happening on the ground in D.C. (If that wasn't enough, we have some extra reading for you too from experts on racial disparities. 
Let's get started.) Two sides of the same coin:Before he was killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis, George Floyd lost his job because of the coronavirus pandemic. Millions of African Americans have experienced the same. A new report by the Economic Policy Institute states that racial and economic inequality have made Black workers, who comprise about 12 percent of the workforce, most vulnerable to the coronavirus.(Tweet this link)[2] Flashback:Other moments that addressed economic and racial inequality include the acquittal of police officers who beat Rodney King in 1992 and in Ferguson, Missouri, after a police officer killed Michael Brown in 2014. George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery remind us that some things have not changed and the coronavirus has pushed the same unfinished agenda from turmoil from decades ago. Our CEO has a full analysis of the current moment. Meanwhile:As protests continue across the country,big labor sides with police unions.[3] Why that's an issue:Police unions have written labor contracts that bar law enforcement agencies across the country from immediately interrogating or firing officers after egregious acts of misconduct. Leaders of the country's other labor unions are tiptoeing around the subject as their members join protests this week over the killing of George Floyd.(Tweet this link)[4] Related:Only 100 (yep, you read that right) hate crimes werepursued by federal prosecutors nationwide between January 2010 and July 2018.[5]And half of those cases involved racially motivated violence against Black people, which is more than any other group.(Tweet this link)[6] On June 5, Breonna Taylor would have been 27.Here's where her case stands now.[7] (Kristine Villanueva/Center for Public Integrity) On the ground in Washington, D.C. The city had endured a few rough nights at first, but overall the protests outside the White House across the city have been mostly peaceful. DCist reports[8]that attendees, including a 9-year-old, say the tear gas, rubber bullets, pepper spray capsules and flash bombs were used to clear Lafayette Square Park without warning. Now, Black Lives Matter D.C. is suing President Donald Trump, Attorney General William Barr and head of military and law enforcement for violating constitutional rights. Why did Trump do this? High and mighty:So he couldhold up a Bible? On Monday evening, the president held a photo op at St. John's Episcopal Church just after officers used tear gas against peaceful protesters outside the White House.(via NBC News)[9] D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser told reporters on Thursday that for the first time this week, no curfew was in place and there were no arrests on Wednesday.(via The Hill)[10] Bowser also sent a letter to Trump requesting that he withdraw all 'extraordinary federal law enforcement and military presence.'[11]Activists plan to continue protests through the weekend. Related:The arrest and detention of thousands nationwide is heightening the risk of the coronavirus spread in the broader community.(via POLITICO)[12]Investigations in your inbox Join the Watchdog newsletter to hear about our latest ground-breaking investigation. ️‍Y'all thought we forgot about pride?Protesters alsorallied outside of the Stonewall Inn in New York City,[13]the site of demonstrations that took place after a police raid at the gay club in the 1960s. The Supreme Court is also preparing to decide whether or not transgender workers will receive workplace protections.[14] In case you thought we forgot about the coronavirus, too:Opioid-related deaths have doubled since this time last year in Chicago, and similar increases are happening across the country. COVID-19 appears to be making the crisis worse.(via ProPublica)[15] Media blitz:As trust in the news media wanes, journalists are being attacked, arrested and harassed while trying to report on the protests. Take Linda Tirado, who was shot in the eye while covering the Minneapolis protests. And a reporter in Louisville was hit by a pepper ball on live television by an officer, causing her to yell:'I'm getting shot! I'm getting shot!'[16](via The New York Times)[17] The scariest part?They're not alone. U.S. police have attacked journalists more than 130 times since May 28.(via NiemanLab)[18] We don't rely on ads. Help our reporting during this critical time. We can't do this work without your support. This week we're talking with our CEO Susan Smith Richardson on race, inequality, and policing and how to make sense of what's happening with these protests. Susan led reporting teams that covered the aftermath of the unrest in Los Angeles following the police beating of Rodney King and the protests in Chicago in 2015 after a police officer killed teenager Laquan McDonald.Journalists have been here before with this story, and we haven't always gotten it right. How can we cover it differently?We have to learn how issues connect, and then report about solutions or responses to the problems of the day. The protests today are different. They are playing out in a pandemic. But the issues underlying them are generations in the making -#8212; racism, income inequality, police brutality and white supremacy. Police violence isn't just about policing, any more than it is about a single police officer or a few bad apples on the force. The violence is interconnected, and it's about systems and policies.I was talking to some members of Black Lives Matter on a conference call yesterday. They emphasized that journalists need to report about the protests from a solutions angle. What's driving the protests, and what do folks think should be done? I couldn't agree more. So much of what we do is identify what is broken. Of course, our job is to expose problems, but when it comes to police violence, we need to spend more time covering responses. I mean report about big ideas for change like defunding police departments. That's good journalism, and journalism that can speak to this moment.How do you develop expertise in reporting about race and inequality?I have always asked sources, 'What should I check out to get a better understanding?' I was on a panel a few years ago with Nikole Hannah-Jones of the New York Times. She said if you want to understand race in America, you need to know the laws that affect it. That's the bottom line. When I was in Chicago, there was a powerful group of academic-activists who believe that if you care about affecting change, your work has to be informed by a deep knowledge of the history of social and racial justice movements in this country. If we want to cover movements for justice today, we need to know the history.What have you learned from covering issues like this in the past?A year after the unrest in Los Angeles, we sent some reporters to look at efforts to rebuild South Central, the part of the city that bore the brunt of the disturbances. The reporters did some serious grass-roots reporting. They dug into what people were doing to invest in and rebuild their community. We intentionally skipped spending a lot of time with elected officials or well-known community leaders. Nothing substitutes for talking to people who are directly affected by an issue. As people hit the streets now in the name of justice and equality, our job is to tell that story accurately, contextually and authentically. We cannot do that if we don't understand the communities that are living with inequality every day.The takeaway:Reporting on solutions moves the needle.A lot of you are probably wondering what you can do to be a better ally. For one,don't just post a black tile[19]to your Instagram page. Seriously,don't[20].A good place to start:Your reading list from our CEO Susan Smith Richardson:'White Fragility' by Robin DiAngelo, in which DiAngelo digs into white peoples' defensiveness over challenges to their ideas about race -#8212; and how that phenomenon props up racism.(via The New Yorker)[21]'From Here to Equality' by William A. Darity Jr. and A. Kirsten Mullen is about how Black reparations can erase the racial wealth gap, and why that's important(especially in the age of the coronavirus pandemic.)[22]And try buying these books fromblack-owned bookstores[23].Also:You can sign up for election reminders, get registered to vote and apply for an absentee ballothere[24]. And if you're already registered, get out there and do the dang thing. If you liked these recs, we have more on the way. Stay tuned for our new newsletter, The Moment, a deep dive into how race and inequality are driving this moment in America. Related:Just this week, Councilwoman Ella Jones was elected the first Black mayor of Ferguson, Missouri. The city became nationally known after the 2014 police killing of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old Black man. When asked what this election means for Ferguson's Black residents, she said: 'One word: inclusion.'(via St. Louis Post-Dispatch)[25] Thanks for reading until the end.

Exhibit B: you may have read recently about a Toronto restaurant owner whose criticism of Israel on Instagram veered into ugly, anti-Semitic tropes about Zionist control of media and elected officials, and ""genocidal Zionists that interfere with our democracy."" The shop owner appears to be on the receiving end of hate-filled censure as a result of her remarks, a reaction that must also be acknowledged and condemned. But it was again painful for me, and Jews like me, to see non-Jews we know and respect endorse the shop owner's position, or worse, repost some of the same anti-Semitic canards on social media. This is especially so for those of us who are angry about the Israeli government's West Bank annexation plan and outspoken about it.
Some of you reading this might also be tempted to counter that sharing content about ""Zionist control"" or ""a Zionist world order"" isn't anti-Semitic, because Zionism doesn't equal Judaism. But this position is a semantic fallacy. Zionism in modern Jewish terms is synonymous with a belief that the state of Israel has a right to exist. By this definition a great many Jews today are Zionists. When an activist group or a shop owner or whoever attaches anti-Semitic tropes to an adjective, Zionist, that millions of Jews wear, they're engaging in anti-Semitism plain and simple.
Ergo, if you want us to stop flagging criticism of Israel as anti-Semitism, stop framing your criticism in poisonous, creaky myths that suggest Jews - sorry, Zionists - are all-knowing masterminds of, say, the economy. (I personally have trouble logging in to my online banking account.)
These Zionist/Jewish tropes have real world consequences. Not only did they fuel the pogroms of eastern Europe and the Holocaust, we've seen them trotted out on both sides of the political spectrum in recent years, by members of the U.K. Labour Party and by the president of the United States. The man who murdered 11 Jews at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018 was a big fan of such theories. According to the Anti-Defamation League, anti-Semitic incidents in the U.S. hit an all-time high last year, ""with more than 2,100 acts of assault, vandalism and harassment"" reported across the country. In 2019, more than half the hate crimes in New York City targeted Jews.
Others reading this column might argue that there is more anti-Semitism on the right, (a la frequent allusions to George Soros), so why even bother mentioning it on the left? The answer is that anti-Semitism is worth mentioning wherever it exists. If our goal is to erode hate everywhere, we must condemn it everywhere, even and especially in our own communities.
At its core, anti-Semitism is a conspiracy theory about Jews wielding outsized power in secret. And conspiracy theories, as you may have noticed, are having a bit of a moment. A Carleton University study from May this year found that nearly half of all Canadians believe at least one coronavirus conspiracy theory (and yes, there is a theory circulating that COVID-19 is a ""Zionist plot."")
This is why confronting anti-Semitism isn't merely a moral imperative. It's a civic one too. When you confront anti-Semitism you aren't just confronting hatred; you're confronting the spread of misinformation and paranoid thinking. You're encouraging critical thinking among your like-minded peers, and promoting democracy for all groups.
My goal in the end isn't to argue a position in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but to make a suggestion about how we argue. If the conflict is new territory for you, please take the time to do some research before you post about it to social media. (Googling ""anti-Semitic canards"" is a good first step.) If you do post something critical about Israel to social media, please refrain from assigning to its citizens conspiratorial superpowers that they do not possess. And if you see a friend or a colleague entertaining the notion that they do: speak up. Your democracy and your conscience will thank you.

PORTLAND, Ore. — City commissioners voted Wednesday to cut $16 million from the Portland Police Bureau’s budget in response to concerns about police brutality and racial injustice.
The cuts are part of a city budget approved by the commissioners in a 3-1 vote. The money saved by eliminating the gun reduction violence team, school resource officers and transit officers will be redirected to social service programs. The lone commissioner to vote no said the cuts to police weren’t deep enough.
Thousands of protesters have filled the streets of Portland every night for three weeks following the death last month of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes.
___
ATLANTA — The police officer who fatally shot Rayshard Brooks in the back after the fleeing man pointed a stun gun in his direction is going to be charged with felony murder and 10 other crimes.
Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard made the announcement about Garrett Rolfe during a news conference Wednesday.
Howard said Rolfe kicked Brooks while he lay on the ground and that the officer with him, Devin Brosnan, stood on Brooks’ shoulder as he struggled for life Friday night.
Rolfe had already been fired after he fatally shot the 27-year-old Brooks. Brosnan had been put on administrative leave.
Brosnan is being charged with aggravated assault and other crimes. The shooting had sparked new demonstrations in Georgia’s capital against police brutality.

 BOSTON — Police officers in Massachusetts would have to be certified by the state under a bill filed Wednesday by Gov. Charlie Baker.
The bill would also allow for the decertification of officers who engage in excessive force, and it encourages additional training, including for advanced deescalation techniques.
Massachusetts is one of only a few states without a statewide certification program for law enforcement.
The Republican governor said his administration worked with members of the Massachusetts Black and Latino Legislative Caucus and public safety officials to draft the bill.
Baker said at a press conference that the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis at the hands of police officers made it clear it's ""the time to get this done.” He added that improving law enforcement is only one piece of the process.

LONDON — The governing body of Oxford University’s Oriel College has recommended the removal of a statue of Victorian imperialist Cecil Rhodes that has long been the target of protests.
The college’s governors, made up of faculty, met Wednesday and said they had “voted to launch an independent Commission of Inquiry into the key issues surrounding the Rhodes statue.“
A similar campaign has sought the removal of his statue in Oxford. The movement has gained new momentum since the death of George Floyd spurred anti-racism protests around the world.
Rhodes made a fortune from gold and diamond mines in the late 19th century, with miners laboring in brutal conditions. His statue was removed from the University of Cape Town in South Africa in 2015.
___
RICHMOND, Va. — A statue of African American tennis star Arthur Ashe has been vandalized.
Photos show the base of the monument tagged with white spray paint and the words “white lives matter” as well as the initials “WLM.” Those initials were later painted over with “BLM,” short for black lives matter.
Richmond Police said they were alerted to the vandalism on Monument Avenue about 10:15 a.m. Wednesday. Police say red paint on the statue itself was already being removed by community members.
Authorities have information on possible suspects and are asking the community to call the Crime Stoppers line if they have information on who was responsible for the vandalism.
The monument was dedicated in 1996 to memorialize the Richmond native, who died in 1993, and to counterbalance the string of statues on Memorial Avenue dedicated to Confederate leaders.

LAS VEGAS — The University of Nevada, Las Vegas has removed a statue of its “Hey Reb!” mascot from in front of its alumni center following an outcry from student groups, including the Native American Student Association.
The decision to remove the bronze statue, which was criticized for its relationship to the Confederacy, came weeks after the death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis.
University President Marta Meana says she has had conversations with individuals and stakeholders about how the university can move forward in light of recent events.
The statue is expected to be returned to its donors.

NEW YORK — New York’s governor signed an executive order recognizing Juneteenth as a paid holiday for state employees to commemorate the emancipation of slaves in the U.S.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo called it “a day we should all reflect upon” and “a day that is especially relevant in this moment in history. Cuomo said he’ll propose legislation next year making June 19 a permanent state holiday.
President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation was effective Jan. 1, 1863, but the news took time to travel. It wasn’t until June 19, 1865, when word of the proclamation was brought by the Union army to enslaved people in Texas.

AMSTERDAM — Vandals have daubed red paint and the word “racist” on a statue of Mohandas Gandhi in Amsterdam, amid a wave of attacks on statues around the world of controversial historical figures.
A worker cleaned the statue Wednesday with a high-pressure water hose. Gandhi, widely lauded for his peaceful campaign to win independence for India, has faced criticism for some of his writings about black Africans.
A lawyer, Gandhi traveled to South Africa in 1893 and stayed for two decades, fighting to expand rights for Indians there. He has faced criticism for referring in his writings to black South Africans as backward. However, he later changed his views and supported the rights of black South Africans.
His nonviolent resistance methods have been used in movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.

DETROIT — A white suburban Detroit police chief has been suspended for 30 days without pay and will undergo diversity training for inappropriate social media posts about people protesting the death of George Floyd.
Trustees in Macomb County’s Shelby Township voted 5-2 on Tuesday night on the punishment for chief Robert J. Shelide, who has held the title since 2015.
Shelide, who earlier apologized, told the township board before the vote that he is “not a racist” and “I bleed blue.”
Shelide had been on administrative leave the past two weeks while officials investigated posts on a now-deleted Twitter account. Screenshots posted on Facebook show one tweet spoke about the need to “unleash real cops” and describing protesters as “barbarians” and needing “body bags.“

PORTLAND, Ore. — Police say a man drove his car into a crowd of protesters early Wednesday in downtown Portland, injuring three people.
Police say the 27-year-old male driver drove away “at a high rate of speed,” but was tracked and arrested on suspicion of hit and run, reckless driving and possession of a controlled substance, according to The Oregonian/OregonLive.
Two people were taken by ambulance to a hospital. Another was taken for treatment in a personal car. Police say none of the injuries were life-threatening.
___
ATLANTA — Georgia’s lieutenant governor is proposing a version of a hate crimes law for the state.
Republican Geoff Duncan called on lawmakers to create a free-standing hate crime and include more categories of bias crimes. Those would involve people victimized because of their culture and their status in exercising First Amendment rights, including worship, free speech, free press, assembly or petition of government.
A previous effort was found unconstitutional by the state Supreme Court more than a decade ago.
In February, Ahmaud Arbery was shot near Brunswick, Georgia. Investigators have said a white man uttered a racial slur after chasing Arbery down and shooting him.
Georgia’s House passed a simpler measure last year that’s been stalled in a Senate committee for more than year. The bill would add extra penalties onto crimes committed because of someone’s race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, mental disability or physical disability.

GENEVA — The brother of George Floyd has made a heartfelt plea to the U.N.’s top human rights body to launch intense international scrutiny of systemic racism and the killing of unarmed blacks by police.
Philonese Floyd’s message by video to the Human Rights Council came as it contemplates an unprecedented bid sought by the Africa Group to create a Commission of Inquiry — the council’s most powerful tool of scrutiny — to examine and report on racism and violence against protesters by police in the United States.
“I am my brother’s keeper. You in the United Nations are your brothers and sisters’ keepers in America — and you have the power to help us get justice for my brother George Floyd,” Floyd said. “I am asking you to help him. I am asking you to help me. I am asking you to help us: Black people in America.”

HUNTINGTON, W.Va. — The Huntington City Council in West Virginia will vote Wednesday on a proposal to make Juneteenth a permanent city holiday.
The celebration commemorates when enslaved people in Texas learned they were free on June 19, 1865. Huntington Mayor Steve Williams told The Herald-Dispatch he supports the proposal and wants the city’s African American residents to know “the city celebrates Juneteenth with them just as we all celebrate July Fourth together.”
The mayor says the idea for the holiday proposal came from meetings with his diversity advisory committee amid the international protests following the death of George Floyd. Williams expects Wednesday’s meeting will help fast-track the resolution so council members can get it in the books before Friday.
The Emancipation Proclamation was signed by President Abraham Lincoln on Jan. 1, 1863, and freed enslaved people of the rebellion Confederate states.
___
HOUSTON — Officials say a statue of a Confederate soldier has been removed from a downtown Houston park and a second Confederate statue is expected to be removed soon.
The “Spirit of the Confederacy” statue was removed late Tuesday from Sam Houston Park. Mayor Sylvester Turner said last week the statue will be housed in the Houston Museum of African American Culture.
A second statue, of Confederate artillery commander Richard W. “Dick” Dowling, is also slated for removal. Initially, the Dowling statue was to be moved from Houston’s Hermann Park to the Sabine Pass Battleground State Historical Site near Port Arthur.
But officials say the Dowling statue will instead be placed in a warehouse, at least temporarily, after leaders in Port Arthur expressed opposition.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — A Roman Catholic chaplain at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has resigned at the request of the archdiocese after sending an email suggesting the killing of George Floyd was not an act of racism and he hadn’t lived “a virtuous life.”
The Archdiocese of Boston asked the Rev. Daniel Patrick Moloney to step down June 9 after he sent the message to Catholics at MIT, The Boston Globe reports. A statement from the archdiocese said Moloney’s comments “were wrong and by his resignation he accepts the hurt they have caused.”
The archdiocese learned about the email from Catholics at MIT and alumni. Moloney says he was trying to speak out against “cancel culture” and regrets his message has been misunderstood.
Suzy Nelson, an MIT vice president and dean for student life, sent an email to students calling Moloney’s comments “deeply disturbing” and “Father Moloney’s message failed to acknowledge the dignity of each human being and the devastating impact of systemic racism.”

Aired 7- 8p ET",FALSE,"WOLF BLITZER, CNN HOST: And may their memories be a blessing.
Thanks very much for watching. I'm Wolf Blitzer in THE SITUATION ROOM.
Erin Burnett OUTFRONT starts right now.
ERIN BURNETT, CNN HOST: OUTFRONT next, two more Trump staffers testing positive for coronavirus after attending the President's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma. This as the President does not deny he asked officials to scale back testing for the deadly virus.
Plus, the White House defending the indefensible, the President calls coronavirus the kung flu. His Press Secretary says it's not racist.
And a New York police officer suspended after apparently putting a black man in a chokehold. The incident was caught on tape. We're going to show it to you. Will he be charged?
Let's go OUTFRONT.
And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett.
OUTFRONT tonight the breaking news, two more staffers on the President's advanced team have now tested positive for coronavirus, both attending Trump's rally in Tulsa on Saturday, which brings the total number of staff in Trump's circle to test positive for Coronavirus. In just over 48 hours to 10: eight campaign staffers and two Secret Service agents.
Now, despite these cases and despite the warnings from one health official after another about even holding the Tulsa rally, the President shows no signs of slowing down. Tomorrow he heads to Phoenix and Arizona for an event at a church that can hold 3,000 people. This is a state where hospitalizations are on the rise 84 percent of the ICU beds in the state filled and yet masks not even mandatory at Trump's campaign event in that church, even though the City of Phoenix has actually made them mandatory.
Now, the President flaunting the rules that apply to everyone else in the city he's visiting. It all comes as Trump is under fire for saying that he asked officials to slow down testing to basically have fewer cases reported. And when asked about those comments today, Trump didn't deny it.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did you ask to slow it down?
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If it did slow down, frankly, I think we're way ahead of ourselves if you want to know the truth. We've done too good a job.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BURNETT: The President asked point blank if he asked to slow it down and he didn't say no, which is it's a pretty big admission to come from the President of the United States since testing is the key to allowing states to control the disease' spread. The facts here that increased testing doesn't even mean more cases.
In New York State tests are way up, cases are actually down and when it comes to people actually being really sick and dying, well, that's hospitalizations, and they are up in about 14 states. Texas, North Carolina and South Carolina, in fact, are all seeing record hospitalizations. But Trump doesn't want people to think that more cases doesn't mean more cases and so now the Trump administration and campaign are trying to blow Trump's comments and blow them off as a joke.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE OFFICE OF TRADE AND MANUFACTURING POLICY: Come on now, Jake. You know it was tongue in cheek.
JAKE TAPPER, CNN HOST: Did the President ...
NAVARRO: Come on now. Come on now, that was tongue in cheek, please.
TIM MARTAUGH, COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN: The President was joking. The President had a tongue in cheek remark there.
KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: It was a comment that he made in jest. It's a comment that he made in passing.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BURNETT: Well, on the basic level here, more than 120,000 dead people isn't a joke and the truth is, is that Trump was not joking about what he meant, because it's consistent with what he said before. I mean, just last month, he said it could be testing is overrated. Maybe it's overrated. It's what we've heard from him time and time again. It's not a joke. It's what he thinks.
Kaitlan Collins is OUTFRONT live outside the White House.
And Kaitlan, what more are you learning tonight about those staffers who have now found out have tested positive after the rally? KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes. These are advanced staffers, meaning that they go to a site that the President or vice president are going to go to. They prepare it, make sure everything is in order for their arrival. But what's different about these two that we've learned now, Erin, that have tested positive is they actually attended the rally on Saturday night.
On Saturday, we learned those six staffers who had tested positive, they then obviously quarantine it did not go into the rally, but these two staffers did and the campaign says they were wearing masks, but it's not immediately clear who they were around, whether it was the President or the Vice President or other top officials because there were a ton of surrogates there including several lawmakers there for the President attending that rally because he wanted to have a lot of surrogates there.
And so that's the question now is and the alarm that's happening inside the campaign is whether or not this outbreak is spreading further, because it's not just these eight campaign staffers. It's also those two Secret Service agents who tested positive on Saturday in addition to those, that first batch of staffers as well. So that's the question here and, of course, this comes as they're preparing more events for the President as he's hitting the road there.
They're trying to figure out how they're going to do that though with the capacity because you know that 3,000 people are supposed to attend that event tomorrow. The question is whether or not it's going to actually be 3,000 people given what we saw happen in Tulsa on Saturday night.
BURNETT: Right.
COLLINS: But it also comes as they're easing restrictions here at the White House. You no longer have to get your temperature checked to come into the grounds as has been required for reporters and staffers for the last several months, Erin.
BURNETT: All right. Kaitlan, thank you very much.
And as that's happening, those details here of the staffers in the rally, coronavirus is continuing to spread across this country. I mentioned the 14 states with hospitalization increases when it comes to cases, 23 states all right seeing an increase over the prior week. Nick Watt is OUTFRONT in Los Angeles tonight.

WATT: And, Erin, here at the International Terminal at LAX, they are trialing now thermal imaging cameras that would scan everybody coming into the terminal from outside or off planes and if your temperature is 100.4 or above, boom, you are flagged. The Mayor of Miami has also just made masks mandatory today.
So our leaders are clearly now planning for the future and it's looking like a long haul, Erin.
BURNETT: Yes. All right. Thank you very much, pretty amazing that temperature how it showed up on Nick's face.
OUTFRONT now, Dr. Sanjay Gupta and Dr. Jonathan Reiner who advised the White House medical team under President George W. Bush and currently directs the cardiac cath Lab at GW.
So Sanjay, the start here with what the context here within the White House team; eight staffers, two Secret Service agents have the virus after the event. Obviously, some of those run the advanced team but now we found out about the Secret Service agents, are you at all surprised?
SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, I'm not surprised in the sense that we clearly not been doing enough testing in this country. So some of these folks if they're getting tested for the first time and they find out that they have it and they may not have symptoms, that part of it doesn't surprise me. I guess the part that surprises me a little bit and I don't know enough about who the staffers were exactly, what sort of proximity they have to the President or they're working in the White House because the understanding was that people there were getting tested pretty frequently. So to suddenly have people show up having the infection now at this rally is obviously concerning.
And then we did calculations saying that there'd be about a hundred people just on our modeling that would show up at this - what was supposed to be a 20,000 person rally, so if eight of them were from the White House staff and Secret Service alone, that's quite a high number.
BURNETT: I mean, Dr. Reiner, despite this, the President is going ahead with that event for young voters in Arizona so masks are not required. It's kind of amazing, because now in Phoenix, you have to wear a mask. The Democratic Mayor is now going to enforce it, but that's the example that's being set, the President just won't do it even though that's the rule of the city.
Number of new cases in Arizona has doubled in the past seven days, just shy of doubling. What's the risk here?
JONATHAN REINER, DIRECTOR OF CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION LABORATORY, GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL: The risk here is accelerating this pandemic. People are worrying about a second wave but we're squarely in the first wave in the south.
[19:09:57]
Arizona over the weekend recorded essentially record new cases, about 10 percent of all the cases in the United States were recorded in Arizona. So why would we have a public gathering particularly one that doesn't enforce basic social distancing or masks during the high point for the virus?
Look at the President's advanced people that Sanjay just spoke about, they probably were at that event for about a week and just being in Tulsa for a week in a hot zone, eight of them contracted the virus. Same thing will happen in Arizona and now think about the consequences for the attendees. It really boggles the mind.
BURNETT: Right. And Sanjay, of course, to point out a lot of these people are young, so they're not worried but they spread it and they spread it to people who are vulnerable, who could get sick and some of them die. I mean, you heard the President not deny whether he told officials to slow down testing. I'll play just a little bit more of his answer, again, for you, Sanjay.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: If it did slow down, frankly, I think we're way ahead of ourselves, if you want to know the truth. We've done too good a job.
(END VIDEO CLIP) BURNETT: I guess first is that possible to do too good a job on testing and I pick something you said in your first answer too, which is we're still not even doing enough of a job on testing.
GUPTA: Yes, right. I don't think that too good of a job is even something that we're close to and I'm not sure that you can do too good of job here. One thing to keep in mind because people get really hung up on this idea. We've done 25 million tests here, what about these other countries?
It's not just a question of how many tests you do, it's also a question of when you do them. You got to remember, we got a slow start in this country and as a result, the infection price spread much more widely than I think we even realize. New study just came out today saying that in the month of March alone, there were probably some 8.5 million And people who became infected just in that one month, what was the official count in that one month? A hundred thousand.
So it just gives you an idea of just how far off base we are and by the way after you test, you also got a contact trace. The whole point of testing is to isolate people who have the virus, be able to trace their context, quarantine as necessary to try and slow down the spread. I'm not sure we have the second part of the equation either.
We don't have enough testing right now, do we have enough contact tracing to backup that testing, we're sort of really behind here, Erin.
BURNETT: And Dr. Reiner, this as the President says it's a joke, the comment he made on testing and all, I'm sorry, all his team are saying it's a joke. It's pretty clear to me it's not a joke, because he said the same thing dead seriously in different ways six Other times, but do you think in any way that he was just trying to be funny?
REINER: No. No, not at all. A week ago in The Wall Street Journal the President was quoted as calling testing quote 'overrated'. One of the original sins of our pandemic response has been our very slow march to ramp up testing and many of us wondered whether all of our difficulties could simply be attributed to incompetence and now we hear the President, basically state that he has instructed his people to slow testing.
First patient in the United States tested positive on January 20th. On March 1st, the day the first patient tested positive in New York, the U.S. had only done a total of 8,000 tests and during that time, the virus was multiplying everywhere. So to hear that the President has perhaps slowed testing is mind-boggling. It's a dereliction of duty.
And I'd like to know from people like Tony Fauci, and Deborah Birx, and Secretary Azar and FDA Commissioner Hahn whether they ever were told to slow walk testing in the United States. This is really a breach of trust.
BURNETT: Well, and I thank you both and I will say this in the context of what Sanjay said. If that really happened in March and you have - when Sanjay is saying you had eight plus million cases out there, some of those people died, OK?
GUPTA: Yes.
BURNETT: Some of those people died. They're not here. And if testing was slowed down and we didn't intervene earlier, some of those people may not be dead and I hope people understand how significant knowing what happened, it's not an academic exercise. Thank you both.
GUPTA: Yes. Thanks, Erin.
BURNETT: And next, the White House tonight trying to defend this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
WEIJIA JIANG, CORRESPONDENT, CBS: That's what he's saying by using the racist phrase 'kung flu?
MCENANY: He is linking it to its place of origin.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BURNETT: Plus, the President says he wasn't involved in the Friday night firing of a U.S. attorney. The White House tells a different story.
And a longtime congressman now fighting for his political life after being caught on a hot mic.

REP. ELIOT ENGEL (D-NY): If I didn't have a primary, I wouldn't care.

[19:14:59]
[19:18:30]
BURNETT: Tonight, the White House defending the President's use of a racist term to describe coronavirus.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: It's a disease without question has more names than any disease in history. I can name kung flu ...
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BURNETT: Here's how the White House explains that.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JIANG: Why does he use racist phrases like the kung flu? MCENANY: The President doesn't, but what the President does do is point to the fact that the origin of the virus is China. It's a fair thing to point out as China tries to ridiculously rewrite history, ridiculously blame the coronavirus on American soldiers. This is what China is trying to do and what President Trump is saying, no China, I will label this virus for its place of origin.
JIANG: That's what he's saying by using the racist phrase kung flu?
MCENANY: He is linking it to its place of origin.
JIANG: What if we have many Asian-Americans who are deeply offended and worried that his use will lead to further attacks and discrimination?
MCENANY: So the President has said very clearly, it's important that we totally protect our Asian community in the U.S. and all around the world. There are amazing people and the spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way, shape or form.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BURNETT: OUTFRONT now, the Democratic Congressman Ted Lieu of California. As you hear that exchange, Congressman, kung flu, is that a racist thing for President Trump to say?
REP. TED LIEU (D-CA): Yes. And thank you, Erin, for that question.
[19:20:00]
I see served on active duty in the United States Military to defend the right of any American to say stupid racist stuff. I just never imagined it would be the President of the United States saying it. And this is not the first time he's made a number of racist comments in three and a half years and even now, instead of trying to unify our country, he's trying to divide us and that's sad.
BURNETT: So you're very clear that it's a racist term. Is he a racist to use it? I mean, the one step further here, is it fair to say he's a racist?
LIEU: So there's a difference between saying this virus came from China and we certainly can't defend China's actions with this virus. They did suppress information about it. That's different than using terms like kung flu or using terms like Chinese virus, I'm not a virus. And we know that there have been an increased number of hate crimes against Asian-Americans across America, the Asian Pacific Policy & Planning Council has been tracking this, we're now at about 1,900 hate Crimes across the country since the pandemic began.
And we're talking about not just harassment, but people being stabbed in Texas, an Asian-American 1920 [00:01:13] is stabbed because their perpetrator thought they were spreading this virus. So fueling this kind of hatred is something the President could not be doing.
BURNETT: Yes. I mean, there's been so many incidents, I know of people who've been spat at yelled at, I mean, really disturbing things. The White House Press Secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, who you heard there, she's trying to defend the President's use of the term and she did so in part by blaming the media. So let me play that exchange for you, Congressman, here it is.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
COLLINS: The media has never called it the kung flu, calling it Chinese coronavirus and calling it a kung flu are very different things.
MCENANY: The media and your network specifically ...
COLLINS: CNN called it the kung flu?
MCENANY: The media and your network have repeatedly used the term 'China virus' and 'Wuhan virus' ...
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BURNETT: So why doesn't that explanation add up? I mean, I know it sounds almost ridiculous to have to ask you this, but could you just explain why it is different to say kung flu than Wuhan virus or, as you said, they've also called it Chinese virus, which is also different?
LIEU: Sure. This virus has an official name, COVID-19, it has an unofficial name, coronavirus. So when you insert an ethnic identifier, it causes people to then increase their harassment and discrimination against Asian-Americans. But you don't just have to listen to what I think of it, you can listen to Kellyanne Conway, Trump's Senior White House Adviser who said that the term kung flu was wrong and highly offensive.
Now, the other thing I want to note is that Asian-Americans according to U.S. census with the fastest rising ethnic group in the last decade and there's enough Asian-Americans in swing votes across America, including 11 percent in Nevada, 5.5 percent in Texas and 4.7 percent new record in Georgia to be the margin of victory this November.
So Donald Trump wants to keep offending Asian-Americans with his racist rhetoric, you can go right ahead and then November is going to come.
BURNETT: So this is not the first time, I mean, obviously he's been using - talking about the virus like this. He also had this exchange with an American, CBS News reporter of Chinese descent last month, let me play that for you.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why is this a global competition to you if everyday Americans are still losing their lives and we're still seeing more cases every day?
TRUMP: Well, they're losing their lives everywhere in the world and maybe that's a question you should ask China. Don't ask me, ask China that question, OK?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sir, why are you saying that to me specifically, that I should ask China?
TRUMP: I'm telling you, I'm not saying it specifically to anybody.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BURNETT: So Congressman, do you see a pattern with this president? I mean, is this purposeful?
LIEU: Absolutely. Donald Trump has been dividing this country since he was elected and it's also something that's not just Donald Trump. If you look at our nation's history, there has been racism against minorities and then Asian-Americans have had a particular kind of racism. We had the whole yellow peril hysteria. We had the Chinese Exclusion Act, the internment of Japanese-Americans at the murder of Vincent Chin, who folks thoughts he's taking away jobs.
And then what we see now is this blaming of Asian-Americans before a virus that knows a no race or geography or party registration puts everyone at risk. And I also note that the term kung flu by the way is also making fun of the situation and we shouldn't be making fun of pandemic that's killed over 120,000 Americans in four months.
BURNETT: Yes. No, and the other thing they turn to as we're just talking about before is to say something as a joke. All right, Congressman Lieu, I appreciate your time. Thank you, sir.
LIEU: Thank you, Erin.
[19:25:01]
BURNETT: Next, conflicting stories about whether the President was involved in firing the prosecutor who was investigating people close to Trump.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
COLLINS: So he was involved in it then?
MCENANY: He was involved in the sign off capacity.
TRUMP: I'm not involved.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BURNETT: So which is it?
And the full report from the medical examiner in the fatal shooting of Rayshard Brooks is out tonight as family and friends say goodbye today.
[19:29:20] BURNETT: Breaking news, Republican Senator Mitt Romney saying the sudden firing of a top prosecutor who led probes into President Trump's allies 'looks pretty swampy' that it does as the White House struggles to explain who and what was behind the removal of Geoffrey Berman as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why was Mr. Berman being dismissed in the first place?
MCENANY: Because Mr. Clayton wanted to go back to New York City. We wanted to keep him in government and therefore he was given the position at SDNY.
COLLINS: But why did the President say he wasn't involved in the firing of Geoffrey Berman when the Attorney General said the President was the one who fired him?
MCENANY: Because the Attorney General was taking the lead on this matter. He did come to the President and report to him when Mr. Berman decided not to leave.
[19:30:03]
And at that point is when the president agreed with the decision of the attorney general to fire Mr. Berman and to promote Mr. Clayton.
COLLINS: So he was involved in it then.
MCENANY: He was involved in the sign-off capacity. He was not -- A.G. Barr was leading the way. But in a sign-off capacity, yes, the president was.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BURNETT: Which means President Trump wasn't telling the truth to this question about why he fired the U.S. attorney.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Attorney General Barr is working on that. That's his department not mine. So that is really up to him. I'm not involved.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BURNETT: OUTFRONT now, the former assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, Daniel Goldman, who was also the lead counsel to the House Democrats during President Trump's impeachment inquiry. So, of course, you know his face.
All right. Thank you very much, Dan.
So, you know, what do you -- what do you make of this? You know, sort of -- he was involved or he wasn't involved. Clearly, he was involved. It's a pretty easy thing to check and yet they aren't giving a straight story. Why is that so hard to do, do you think?
DANIEL GOLDMAN, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY: Well, it's hard to do because of a quirk in the law which actually because Geoffrey Berman was actually appointed by the district court in the Southern District and not confirmed by the Senate, he can only be fired by the president not by Bill Barr.
And so that is why Bill Barr wrote the letter on Saturday saying the president has fired you and I'm relaying that message. The president, of course, wants to keep some remove from the termination of a U.S. attorney who is we know conducting investigations into associates of the president, including his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani.
But he was unable to keep that remove and he clearly didn't understand the legal ramifications of what was going on when he said on Saturday that he has nothing to do with it. Politically it will look very bad if it comes out the reason Geoff Berman was fired was because he was conducting investigations into the president or anyone around the president.
BLITZER: Is there -- how much of a question is there, I mean, that that isn't the motive? I mean, it seems hard to imagine anything else at this point. Why would you go in and fire a guy like that, and they are denying that it's because of those investigations. They're denying it, but does that add up at all?
GOLDMAN: Well, their proffered reasons do not add up. The nation that Jay Clayton during a pandemic needs to get back to New York right now makes no sense when everyone is teleworking to begin with. It's also destabilizing to both the SEC and the Southern District of New York. It occurred late on a Friday night. Bill Barr lied about Geoffrey Berman stepping down. And then he changed course and put the deputy U.S. attorney in the southern district in charge rather than the U.S. attorney in New Jersey.
There are so many reasons why this smells really bad. But we don't know what actually the conflict was or the reason was why Bill Barr wanted Geoffrey Berman gone and why Trump wanted Geoffrey Berman gone. That is why we really do need congressional hearings with Geoffrey Berman there, with his former deputy U.S. attorney Robert Khuzami testifying, with other people in the Department of Justice perhaps on Mueller's team.
We need to understand how politicized the Department of Justice has gotten under Trump and Bill Barr.
BURNETT: So, you know, I want to ask you about the former national security adviser John Bolton, because, obviously, as you know, you were in the middle of this, right? He resisted House Democrats' efforts to get him to testify during the impeachment inquiry and this morning, he came out this morning and yet again and slammed how Democrats conducted the impeachment inquiry. Here he is.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOHN BOLTON, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: I think there were a lot of Republicans in the House that might have been open to a more reasoned, nonpartisan effort. They made it a partisan fight in the House. That guaranteed it would be a partisan fight in the Senate. And they lost. That is not a very good strategy.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BURNETT: Of course you were sitting there day after day making the legal arguments in this case. What do you say to John Bolton?
GOLDMAN: I say he's got very good talking points but not very good facts. The fact was this always was a nonpartisan, bipartisan investigation. It was, of course, led by the majority, which were the Democrats. But the Republicans had every right to ask as many questions and they did. They had the right to call witnesses.
This was only partisan because the Republicans rallied around president Trump regardless of what his conduct was.
So, to the extent it was partisan and that was problematic it was not because we ran a partisan investigation. We called nonpartisan witnesses and we asked them questions under oath and they gave answers under oath. If the facts were unfavorable to President Trump, and the Republicans wanted to defend President Trump, that is not because we ran a bipartisan or a partisan investigation. That is because they were partisan (ph).
[19:35:02]
BURNETT: So, why do you think John Bolton didn't testify? I mean, you know, he was subpoenaed and then, you know, said I want to wait for a court ruling. But he's come out and said all the damning things he would have said under oath, you know, to you in Congress there in a book. Why do you think he didn't do it then?
GOLDMAN: I think there are a couple possible reasons. One is he saw dollar signs and he wanted to wait and make money off of the information that he had. And I also think John Bolton is part of the Republican establishment and he may have been a little reticent to come in and testify before a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives.
But that's all speculation. The fact of the matter is John Bolton had no good faith basis, no reason not to testify as was ultimately borne out by the fact that he was willing to testify in the Senate. There is no difference between the House and the Senate in terms of a congressional subpoena.
Yet John Bolton's attorney told me directly that they would file a lawsuit in court if he were subpoenaed and we'd still be in court today waiting for a ruling on that lawsuit.
BURNETT: Even as the book came out. It's hard to understand.
All right. Daniel Goldman, thank you very much. I appreciate your time.
GOLDMAN: Thanks very much, Erin.
BURNETT: And next, the D.A. in the Rayshard Brooks case facing pressure to step aside after charging two Atlanta officers in his death. Why?
And a New York officer suspended without pay after this video surfaced showing him using an apparent chokehold which has been banned. The attorney for the man you see in this video is OUTFRONT.
[19:40:34]
BURNETT: Tonight, attorneys for the former Atlanta police officer charged with killing Rayshard Brooks are disputing statements made by the district attorney. This as family and friends have been gathering to say their final good-byes.
Natasha Chen is OUTFRONT.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
NATASHA CHEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Some of the people who paid their respects to Rayshard Brooks today may not have known him personally but they say they're all too familiar with his experience.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I feel like the soul of America is really sick, that they have desensitized when it comes to crimes against people of color.
CHEN: Outside the church today, not one police officer in sight. A spokesperson for the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church said the Brooks family asked Atlanta police not to be involved in the security for the event. Streets the city planned to shut down to traffic were opened and a private security team escorted the hearse carrying brooks to the church followed by his family.
A few hours earlier a full report from the Fulton County medical examiner officially determined his cause of death as homicide. It described two gunshot wounds to the back and said toxicology results are still pending.
Also pending is the Georgia Bureau of Investigation report on what happened the night he was shot to death even as the Fulton County District Attorney's Office has done its own investigation and charged the two officers he encountered last week.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are being attacked. These guys are our brothers. We're being attacked by Paul Howard. We do the job to protect. We expect to be protected by our leaders and they've all failed us, all of them.
CHEN: Critics including Congressman Doug Collins questioned the felony charge against former officer Garrett Rolfe seen on surveillance video shooting Brooks after Brooks aimed a Taser over his shoulder when he ran away. GOV. DOUG COLLINS (R-GA): What has happened over the past couple of weeks has been wrong. It is time for the district attorney of Fulton County to step aside and have someone -- and to allow the attorney general to appoint an independent prosecutor. You cannot prosecute cases until the investigation is over. You don't do it for politics.
PAUL HOWARD, DISTRICT ATTORNEY: I think what those protesters and all over the country, they're not demonstrating because they thought Paul Howard did something political. They're demonstrating because citizens in our country continue to die and a high number of those citizens are African-Americans.
CHEN: But attorneys for Rolfe insist that not only were his actions justified under Georgia law because he was acting in self-defense but that the D.A.'s, quote, choice to charge him is justified only by his hopes to improve his performance in the upcoming run-off election.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
CHEN: There is a private funeral planned here tomorrow starting at 1:00. Invite only. Atlanta police have been asked not to be involved with the security of that event. On the guest list of the Atlanta mayor, the D.A., and during the service we expect to hear from Reverend Bernice King, the daughter of Martin Luther King Jr., as well as Reverend Raphael Warnock, a Senate candidate here in Georgia -- Erin.
BURNETT: All right. Natasha, thank you very much.
And next, a New York police officer suspended following an apparent chokehold incident that is on tape puts a long time congressman now in a fierce primary fight after among other things being caught on open mic.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If I didn't have a primary, I wouldn't care.

[19:48:05]
BURNETT: Tonight, a New York City police officer suspended without pay for detaining a man by using an apparent chokehold banned by the city council just last week and a warning that some of you may find this video disturbing.
Let me play the part.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Stop choking him, bro! Yo! Stop choking him! Yo, he's choking him. Let him go, bro. Let him go!
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look, look.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Back up.
(EXPLETIVE DELETED)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Back him up.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BURNETT: OUTFRONT now, Lori Zeno. She's the attorney for the man who is detained in that video.
So, Lauren, let me just ask you the NYPD now says they are conducting a full investigation into exactly what happened. What do you think should happen to the officer?
LORI ZENO, ATTORNEY FOR MAN OUT IN APPARENT CHOKEHOLD BY NYPD: Oh, he should definitely be fired and he should have charges brought against him. You know, just last week, the governor signed into law that it is a felony for anyone to use a chokehold. And this officer decided that the law doesn't apply to him and I might add for the -- I think ninth time in his career, he decided that he could again abuse somebody.
And he used a chokehold and he choked my client until he was unconscious and, thank God, there was an officer on the scene who pulled him off of my client when people were screaming he was choking him because at that point he was already unconscious.
BURNETT: So your client was completely unconscious, you are saying was saved by another officer on the scene?
ZENO: Absolutely. Yes, he was.
(CROSSTALK)
ZENO: Sorry, go ahead.
BURNETT: OK, sorry, I know there is a little delay here with the technology.
So, what's the reason if any that they're giving as to why he would use a chokehold after it had been banned by the New York City Council as you just mentioned?
[19:50:04]
ZENO: They're not giving a reason, you know, as to why. Personally, I think it's about what kind of officer you are, right, and how do you -- how do you do your job, right?
So, obviously, this man, you know, resorts to violence quite often, and that's just the way he does it, you know? So, instinctively, when he's going to take somebody down or he's going to do something, he's going to be violent and he's either going to do a chokehold or, you know, punch somebody or, you know, something violent. It's going to hurt someone. That just seems to be what it does.
BURNETT: So, the body cam footage that we have shows officers being taunted, you know, sort of verbal taunts before they actually detain your client. I want to just play some of that for you, Lori. Here it is.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Go ahead. Go ahead.
(INAUDIBLE)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You the only one (INAUDIBLE) -- stoner, go ahead. I ain't driving --
(EXPLETIVES DELETED)
(INAUDIBLE)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BURNETT: So, Lori, what led to this whole altercation that we just saw play out, as far as you understand it?
ZENO: Well, what I was originally told was the officers received a call from somebody complaining that some guys were throwing empty cans at them. That's what they claimed but then when we asked to hear the 911 call, there was no 911 call so then they changed their story.
And then eventually, it just sort of came out that they saw them on the beach. They recognized all three of them. In fact, one of the officers said how they recognized my client as the bipolar guy that was from the other day. I don't know what that means.
But -- and so you can see on the video cam or the body cam where it's the officers who start the physical contact. Clearly, these guys are intoxicated and then my client, you know, has potentially has some sort of mental disorder and so the officers should not have been exaggerating everything. They should have been trying to deescalate but instead, you see at one point, one of the officers shoves a guy who is taking the video on his camera and around his phone.
So, you know, and then when the guy comes back, you can see that officer is smirking and, you know, just kind of agitating them, you know, instead of just letting them walk away, you know, and I don't think they needed to have three officers pounce on my client who weighs about 100 pounds soaking wet but --
BURNETT: Yes. All right. I appreciate your time. I mean, it's of usually these are going to be serious questions and this is the accountability that we're now all going to see more of. Appreciate your time. Lori, thank you.
ZENO: You're very welcome. Thank you.
BURNETT: And next, a long-time Democratic congressman facing his toughest primary challenge after an embarrassing hot mic incident. Will it matter?

BURNETT: Tonight, one of the top Democrats in the House in danger of losing the seat he held since 1989.
M.J. Lee is OUTFRONT.

LEE: At a New York press conference addressing protests following the death of George Floyd.
The 16-term congressman in danger of losing his seat --
ENGEL: When I go back to Washington, I'm going to fight for justice.
LEE: -- to Jamaal Bowman, an insurgent challenger from the left.
JAMAAL BOWMAN (D), CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: Hello, hello. How are you doing? How are you doing?
LEE: The New York primary race exposing a larger rift dividing the Democratic Party with establishment heavyweights like Hillary Clinton, Jim Clyburn and Nancy Pelosi publicly taking sides against big name progressives like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. The matchup reminding some New Yorkers of a 2018 primary race next door when Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez delivered had a defeat to long-time Congressman Joe Crowley.
Bowman, a first-time political candidate, trying to sway voters in New York 16th congressional district which spans parts of the Bronx and Westchester County.
BOWMAN: Thank you so much.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You got my vote.
BOWMAN: I got your vote?

BOWMAN: Time for a change. Absolutely.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thirty-one years! He got go to.
BOWMAN: Thirty-one -- you got to go.
LEE: The middle school principal accusing Congressman Engel of being out of touch with his home district.
BOWMAN: Congressman Engel has been absent, I've been here fighting for our communities for the last 20 years.
LEE: Engel first elected to the House in 1988 and currently the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, saying his decade's long record speaks for itself.
ENGEL: The voters aren't stupid. They vote for me every two years because they know I care about them. I work hard for them. I produce for them, and I vote the way they would like me to vote.
LEE: The congressman also facing questions about why he was hunkered down in his D.C. area Maryland home instead of being in his New York district during the worst of the coronavirus pandemic.
Engel saying he was simply following doctor's orders.
ENGEL: They are trying to make a phony issue out of nothing. I was quarantining myself because the place near Washington is bigger and my wife and I and our apartment in New York could not both quarantine at the same time.
LEE: Bowman saying Engel's hot mic moment speaks volumes.
BOWMAN: When the people see you and feel your presence and know you've been here for decades doing the work, you don't have to scramble for the microphone.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
LEE: When he asked Congressman Engel about that hot mic moment, he said he feels very, very strongly about Black Lives Matter. Bowman said this is deeply personal for him. He told CNN as a black man, he has been dealing with police brutality his entire life and his first run in with the police he said happened just when he was 11 years old -- Erin.

Eight minutes separate Cordoba Florence Artigau from the place where George Floyd was killed days ago. Racism and hate crimes are common currency in America.
Counted from its own perspective, Florence explained in communication with La Voz that unfortunately in that country the videos published on the abuse of power and extreme violence carried out by the police, especially white police towards minorities, are not novelty and are not news. ""This is happening years ago and unfortunately it's very possible that it will continue to happen,"" he said.
What George Floyd, the African-American killed by policemen in the US, died of. USA
The particular thing about Floyd's case is that it is given in broad daylight in front of several civilians, one of whom does a Live streaming on Facebook that of course goes viral in a matter of minutes.
""I daresay we witnessed a murder live. 8 minutes and 46 seconds of a man who is reduced and immobilized not by one, but by three policemen who ignore people's desperate request to let him go,"" said the 30-year-old who lives three years ago in the United States.
George Floyd offers no resistance. However, policeman Derek Chauvin continues to exert strength with his knee, even though Floyd begs with the last breath ""please, I can't breathe.""
""It is very difficult to see such a nonsense death and stand by. No one wants and no one can be complicit in such an aberration. At the end of this, racial sensitivities had already sharpened since Donald Trump took office. I don't think I need to say it. We already know that Trump is not a big fan of diversity and colour,"" he said.

""This is exactly 8 minutes from my house. The community made a kind of urban altar with graffiti on the wall and a circle on the street full of flowers in the best Strawberry Fields style in Central Park,"" Florence said.

Everyday discrimination
""Racial discrimination exists and occurs more in some states than in others,"" said the young woman, who lived in several U.S. states.
As he explained, there is generally more diversity and acceptance in large cities (such as in New York or Los Angeles). ""I lived in New York, California, Utah and now in Minnesota and only once experienced discrimination. I don't miss out on the possibility that this was just a stroke of luck,"" he said.
Demonstrations against racism, following the assassination of Floyd (AP).
Florence explained that in southern states like Alabama or Mississippi, racism is much more pronounced.
""There are many houses that directly have the Confederate flag flying on a mast or hanging on the door. That tells you everything,"" the young lady said.
The Cordoba told a case of discrimination suffered in its own flesh in the years leading up to being based in the United States for her work. On one of his travels, he suffered harassment when he entered that country, because he was Latino.
""It was at the Miami airport. They put me in a little room and asked me a thousand questions. This happened when I was still studying and I traveled to see some friends. The plan wasstart with California and then we'd go skiing. They asked me what my old men were doing and how I had money to travel if I was just a student. When I told them I was lucky enough that my old men could pay for the trip, they said to me, textual words, that 'I had an easy life, and that Mom and Dad weren't always going to be there to save me.' They emptied my bag, asked for my friends' first and last name, and called them to see if my story was real. They asked me why I was bringing so many things if I only came for a couple of weeks, even after I told them I had two bags because one was my ski gear,"" he added.
""I was harassed for half an hour that it felt eternal and when they finally found nothing to incriminate me, they let me go and one of the officers said 'be careful because we're going to be looking at you.' At this point I didn't care about the trip anymore and I wanted to go home. I was in many countries and I never experienced a similar situation,"" he said.
""Discrimination when entering the country is not new. I'm sure a lot of people went from going on vacation for a couple of weeks and being treated like criminals in migrations. Because that's how they make you feel, that you're doing something wrong,"" he said.
As for these kinds of situations, Florence appealed to the internal work that needs to be done every time it happens. ""The important thing is not to let this affect you (although it's difficult) but it's also good to stop by to start understanding how minorities feel every day in this and in many countries.""

Classist and racist discrimination
Analyzing the current situation in the wake of Floyd's case, Florence differentiated the classist discrimination from the racist, and the difference between Argentina and the United States on this issue.
""I was born and raised in Argentina and have always been treated as an equal in all my fields. I never knew what it was like to be of another race, from another culture or from another country until I moved here. In Argentina it was always everything more, let's say, 'homogeneous' for me. My friends and I are always in similar situations, learnings and experiences, so my evolution as a person was much more horizontal and homogeneous than the one that many minority people lived here,"" he explained.
""This I am about to say seems half played and maybe a lot of people differ, but I can see from here, that Argentina is mostly classist. There is discrimination by skin tone and perhaps with the traits most associated with natives, of course, but I feel that the biggest discrimination is socioeconomic.
Here in the USA there are both. Racial and socio-economic discrimination. If I had been raised here as a person belonging to a minority, I believe that this struggle would touch me much deeper than I do now and understand much more the enormous wounds that black men and women carry with them centuries ago. Being black shouldn't be a death sentence. No black, no Latino, no Asian, no native, nothing. Man, woman, humans. Ready,"" the young lady opined.
Protests in New York over the murder of Floyd (AP).
Weapons, candy
The young woman said that Minneapolis was always a very quiet city: ""Nothing ever happens here and that's why people are terrified of this whole situation. I as an Argentinian are already a little used to it. Coming from a country that is always in crisis helped me develop a special calm for these kinds of storms. I know what looting, riots, protests are like. I'm not afraid.""
""What is scary is that here they sell weapons like candy. I assure you that more than half of U.S. citizens have apersonal weapon in his house and never missing a madman who opens fire in the middle of the protest.""
Demonstrations against racism, following the assassination of Floyd (AP).
Solidarity that is not news
What the media often doesn't show is the bright side of things. After the nights of destruction came the days of solidarity and collaboration. Every day the citizens of Minneapolis gather at the places where there was damage, looting and protests and help clean up the area. There are donations of food and clothing.
""We on the porch of our house put water, food, clothes and a first aid kit in case someone in the way they need it. They opened an account to donate and rebuild the city and help the small merchants who lost everything to start over. This is the hope that not everything is lost,"" Florence opined.
The coronavirus, time bomb in the background
Another thing that came to the background in the United States is the Covid-19, which still spins silently. In the protests there was no social estrangement, disinfectants, or alcohol in gel.
""A lot of people did wear masks but I doubt this will make a difference. There may be a spike in cases in the coming weeks and hospitals will collapse. I hope I'm wrong,"" he added.

""The American people are finally awake""
Florence does not let go of its Latin American roots but its long time in the Country led by Trump, forged empathy for that land and its people. ""Beyond fear and uncertainty, it makes me very happy to see that the American people are finally awake. It's time for a reform. It's been a long time since the U.S. ceased to be the free country. Here the free are very few. Health and education are inaccessible. If you study you end up with a huge debt and if you get sick too,"" he opined.
""Discrimination and racism exist. It happens all the time when you see and when you don't see. Front and back. I would like the abuse of the police force to never happen again, but if it happens, I would like the social reaction to be the same and not to matter race, ethnicity, history. What matters is that the person who has to protect you is killing a man in the street for no reason. I would like this enormous sense of solidarity and defence that is being generated in the world to spread and apply to all human beings regardless of the color of their skin,"" she added.
Towards the end of the interview, Florence called everyone to think: ""Be patient, be gentle, be humble. All lives must be valued. If you see that someone is being treated unfairly, protest for them in search of peace and equality. You have to participate and get involved to achieve change. You're still breathing, help others breathe too.""

125,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1251/Files (250).DOCX","Newstex Blogs",2020-11-13,"1675 words",NA,"Shen Lu",NA,"Liberal Chinese Americans Are Fighting Right-Wing WeChat Disinformation",FALSE,"Nov 13, 2020( Foreign Policy: http://www.foreignpolicy.com/ Delivered by Newstex) The 2016 U.S. presidential election brought attention[1] to right-wing Chinese Americans effectively using WeChat to spread strident and divisive messages, conspiracy theories, and disinformation among Chinese-language speakers. This year, unfounded conspiracy theories made their way into hundreds of thousands of chat groups on WeChat again. Chinese supporters of Donald Trump who follow pro-Trump platforms believe the lies that the election was a fraud and that Hunter Biden is a pedophile who has molested many girls in China. A media network associated with the billionaire Guo Wengui and former Trump strategist Steve Bannon was among the chief sources of false stories[2] about the Biden family and their business dealings in China. 
But unlike in 2016, liberal Chinese voices have taken up the WeChat battleground to counterbalance right-wing conspiracy content, engaging a monolingual audience that's part of a fast-growing minority bloc with the ability to possibly determine the outcome of future U.S. elections. Most Chinese Americans vote[3] Democrat, but there's a substantial bloc of Trump supporters among new immigrants. In the weeks leading up to this year's election, these liberal accounts published—sometimes cross-published on different platforms—a plethora of content educating Chinese readers about the U.S. election system, debunking right-wing conspiracies, analyzing how a second Trump term might affect Chinese Americans, and pointing directly to the rifts between first- and second-generation immigrants caused by politics. Some of the liberal platforms are run by former Chinese journalists who now reside in North America, others by community volunteers, and many by individual political news junkies. In stark contrast to the pro-Trump Chinese-language WeChat platforms, most of these accounts are unwaveringly pro-feminism, pro-civil rights movement, and anti-racism. 'It was a real shock when we saw the 'Chinese Americans for Trump' group being extremely vocal on WeChat in 2016, and we felt we shouldn't be represented by them,' said Wu Bo, the editor in chief of Chinese American[4], one of the prominent liberal-leaning WeChat accounts that has 120,000 followers. Wu, a software engineer in his 50s and based in the Bay Area, started the platform in 2014, with two other volunteer editors. In a Zoom meeting before this year's election, the editors told me that they felt beleaguered among friends in their age group between 40 and 60, most of whom supported Trump, though not all of them can vote. And most of the comments they receive on each article come from Trump supporters. After the 2016 presidential election, Wu's site, Chinese American, started to gain influence among first-generation Chinese immigrants who moved to the United States after the 1990s by publishing articles on social and political issues concerning this community. It rose to fame this summer, when the Black Lives Matter movement was sweeping across the United States. A series of essays[5] written by second-generation Chinese Americans urging their parents to support the movement and responses from the older generation went viral after appearing on Chinese American. In the election season, editors published another series of letters fostering conversations between liberal young Chinese Americans and their parents, who are often conservative. Instead of directly rebutting rumors spread by conservative Chinese, Chinese American published a series of profiles of prominent Chinese Americans—left and right—taking readers through the journey of the formation of their politics and peeking into their views on thorny issues that Chinese Americans care deeply about: educational attainment, racism, safety. 'Debunking rumors takes way too much energy. We don't have that much time,' Wu said. 'I think it's more effective to combat rumors by telling stories of real people and what they have to say about politics.' To be sure, conservative Chinese Americans are a minority. Only 12 percent[6] of Chinese Americans identified as Republicans in 2018. An AAPI Data survey carried out this summer showed that 20 percent of Chinese American voters thought[7] they would vote for Trump. Many Chinese Trump supporters moved to the United States in the 1990s or later for a better future for both themselves and their children. The most vocal ones, though many of whom can't or don't vote, put much emphasis on personal mobility, educational attainment, and stability over larger issues affecting the community as a whole. They tend to be against affirmative action and pro-police. But even this group is not a monolith. A recent survey conducted by the AAPIs for Civic Empowerment Education Fund on suburban Chinese Americans in California found that quite a large number of them were undecided on a range of political issues. Twenty-two percent of survey respondents weren't sure whether they supported a proposition to restore affirmative action, and 41 percent neither agreed nor disagreed that race should be considered a factor in college admissions. Community organizers and politicians haven't really engaged the new Chinese immigrants, who are often isolated and even alienated, said Alex Tom, the executive director of the Center for Empowered Politics Education Fund, an advocacy group in California. Tom believes that liberal-leaning WeChat publications can be one important channel of an ecosystem to tap the group that hasn't yet developed informed political opinions. 'It's still an uphill battle,' Tom said. 'But I think these are the kind of experiments that are needed.' North America Headlines[8], another liberal Chinese site, has taken a different approach to election coverage. The account, run by a professional editorial team, tackles[9] popular conspiracy theories by fact-checking them and providing truth to readers; translates[10] key information about the elections from English into Chinese; and publishes in-depth political analysis and commentaries[11]. Its executive editor, surnamed Chen, a former journalist who now lives in Canada, said the outlet's readership spiked 20 percent in the six months leading up to the election, and many of them were conservatives. 'Trump frequently targeted China on his campaign trails, and his rhetoric conflating the government and the people has instigated hate crimes against many Chinese people,' Chen said. 'This, plus his mishandling of the pandemic, has turned many Chinese supporters away. But this doesn't mean that their general politics has changed.' North America Headlines is also present on Weibo[12]. It pushed out live alerts about election results to its 120,000 Weibo followers during election week. In the absence of reliable Chinese media coverage of the U.S. elections (Chinese media were largely prohibited[13] from close coverage), North America Headlines became a crucial news source for readers in China who followed the contested race. 'The reality is such that you can't discuss Chinese politics in China,' Chen said. 'Discussions about American politics are insofar allowed. I hope that what we publish can educate our readers about how democracy works.' Others see the United States as a chance to do honest journalism, increasingly impossible in China itself. Cheng Yizhong, the former editor in chief of two prominent liberal publications known for their investigative reporting, Southern Metropolis Weekly and Beijing News, now runs a New York-based media company that publishes 'New York and Beyond' and 'New York Chinaren,' two WeChat-based publications that have 190,000 followers combined. Their election content, similar to that of North America Headlines, leaned toward news coverage. Cheng, who moved to the United States in 2016, said he was saddened and shocked by the rumor-filled overseas Chinese-language media and that he also saw a market for ethical Chinese-language journalism. At the end of 2019, Cheng put together a team of 15 journalists to serve the Chinese-speaking community in their adopted home. 'It's not news at all,' Cheng said, referring to the misinformation commonly seen in other popular Chinese-language media and on WeChat. 'I will never pander to the ridiculous rumormongering and fearmongering. I go back to the simple stuff: facts. If the Biden scandal were factual, I'd run it.' Though he admits that misinformation and baseless, sensational content will always grab more attention than serious journalism, Cheng sees value in what he does: Not only is it serving the Chinese immigrant community in the United States, but it provides his colleagues and friends in China a rare window to peek into American society and politics. 'What I'm doing is upholding the self-respect of the news industry, or at least the bottom line, which is telling the truth,' Cheng said.

PORTAGE, Michigan — The first of many freezer-packed COVID-19 vaccine vials made their way to distribution sites across the United States on Sunday, as the nation's pandemic deaths approached the horrifying new milestone of 300,000.
The rollout of the Pfizer vaccine, the first to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration, ushers in the biggest vaccination effort in U.S. history — one that health officials hope the American public will embrace, even as some have voiced initial skepticism or worry. The first of two shots are expected to be given in the coming week to health care workers and nursing home residents.
Quick transport is key for the vaccine, especially since this one must be stored at extremely low temperatures — about 94 degrees below zero. Early Sunday, workers at Pfizer — dressed in fluorescent yellow clothing, hard hats and gloves — wasted no time as they packed vials into boxes. They scanned the packages and then placed them into freezer cases with dry ice. The vaccines were then taken from Pfizer's Portage, Michigan, facility to Gerald R. Ford International Airport in Grand Rapids, where the first cargo plane took off amid what airport officials called a “jubilant” mood.
“This is a historic day,” said Richard W. Smith, who oversees operations in the Americas for FedEx Express, which is delivering 630-some packages of vaccine to distribution sites across the country. The United Parcel Service also is transporting a share of the vaccine.
Helping with the transport of the vaccine has special meaning to Bruce Smith, a FedEx package handler at the Grand Rapids airport, whose older sister, Queen, died after she contracted the coronavirus in May. She was hospitalized in Georgia one day after he saw her on a video chat, and they never spoke again.

US investigating computer hacks of government agencies
WASHINGTON (AP) — Hackers broke into the networks of federal agencies including the Treasury and Commerce departments as U.S. government officials said Sunday that they were working to identify the scope of the breach and to fix the problem.
The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security's cybersecurity arm are investigating.
The hacks were revealed just days after a major cybersecurity firm disclosed that foreign government hackers had broken into its network and stolen the company's own hacking tools. Many experts suspect Russia as responsible for the attack against FireEye, a major cybersecurity player whose customers include federal, state and local governments and top global corporations.
There was no immediate connection between the attacks, and it wasn't immediately clear if Russia was also responsible for the hack of the Treasury Department, which was first reported by Reuters. National Security Council spokesperson John Ullyot said in a statement that the government was “taking all necessary steps to identify and remedy any possible issues related to this situation.”
The government's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said separately that it has been working with other agencies “regarding recently discovered activity on government networks. CISA is providing technical assistance to affected entities as they work to identify and mitigate any potential compromises.”

Trump appoints flurry of allies as presidency winds down
WASHINGTON (AP) — His time in the White House rapidly ending, President Donald Trump is rewarding some supporters and like-minded allies with the perks and prestige that come with serving on federal advisory boards and commissions.
On Thursday, Trump announced his intention to nominate two authors who wrote books that flattered him to a board that makes recommendations on education research. Another author who helped write a favorable book about the president was chosen for the same board a few days earlier.
On Wednesday, the Department of Defense announced that China hawk Michael Pillsbury would become the chair of a board that gives Pentagon leadership advice on how to enhance national security. Pillsbury has served as an outside adviser to the president on China.
And on Tuesday, Trump said he would appoint his former counselor and 2016 campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, to serve on the board of visitors to the U.S. Air Force Academy. Going to the same board will be Heidi Stirrup, an ally of top Trump adviser Stephen Miller. She served as a White House liaison at the Justice Department and was told to vacate the building when top department officials learned of her efforts to collect inside information about ongoing cases and the department’s work on election fraud.
Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao was among the appointees to the board of trustees at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. She’s also married to Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.

Agent: Master spy writer John le Carre dies at 89
LONDON (AP) — John le Carre, the spy-turned-novelist whose elegant and intricate narratives defined the Cold War espionage thriller and brought acclaim to a genre critics had once ignored, has died. He was 89,
Le Carre’s literary agency, Curtis Brown, said Sunday that he died in Cornwall, southwest England on Saturday after a short illness. The death was not related to COVID-19.
In such classics as “The Spy Who Came in from the Cold,” “Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy” and “The Honourable Schoolboy,” Le Carre combined terse, but lyrical prose with the kind of complexity expected in literary fiction. His books grappled with betrayal, moral compromise and the psychological toll of a secret life. In the quiet, watchful spymaster George Smiley, he created one of 20th-century fiction’s iconic characters — a decent man at the heart of a web of deceit.
For le Carre, the world of espionage was a “metaphor for the human condition.”
Born David Cornwell, le Carre worked for Britain's intelligence service before turning his experience into fiction in works including “Tinker, Tailor, Soldier Spy” and “The Spy Who Came in from the Cold.”

White House, other top officials to get early vaccine access
WASHINGTON (AP) — Senior U.S. government officials, including some White House officials who work in close proximity to President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, will be offered coronavirus vaccines as soon as this week, while its public distribution is limited to front-line health workers and people in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.
Doses of the newly approved vaccine from Pfizer will be made available to those who work in close quarters with the nation's top leaders, two people familiar with the matter confirmed. They said the move was meant to prevent more COVID-19 spread in the White House, which has already suffered from several outbreaks of the virus that infected Trump and other top officials, and other critical facilities.
It was not immediately clear how many officials would be offered the vaccine initially and whether Trump or Pence would get it.
The Trump administration is undertaking the vaccination program under federal continuity of government plans, officials said.
“Senior officials across all three branches of government will receive vaccinations pursuant to continuity of government protocols established in executive policy,” said National Security Council spokesperson John Ulyot. “The American people should have confidence that they are receiving the same safe and effective vaccine as senior officials of the United States government on the advice of public health professionals and national security leadership.”

Vandals hit Black churches during weekend pro-Trump rallies
WASHINGTON (AP) — Vandals tore down a Black Lives Matter banner and sign from two historic Black churches in downtown Washington and set the banner ablaze as nighttime clashes Saturday between pro-Donald Trump supporters and counterdemonstrators erupted into violence and arrests.
Police on Sunday said they were investigating the incidents at the Asbury United Methodist Church and Metropolitan A.M.E. Church as potential hate crimes, which one religious leader likened to a cross burning.
“This weekend, we saw forces of hate seeking to use destruction and intimidation to tear us apart,” District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser said Sunday. “We will not let that happen.”
A video posted on Twitter showed a group of men appearing to take down a BLM sign at the Metropolitan A.M.E. Church as others in the crowd shout, “Whose streets? Our streets.” Another video showed people pouring an accelerant on a BLM banner and setting it ablaze in the street as others cheered and cursed antifa. Someone walks up about a minute later and uses a fire extinguisher to put out the flames.
“It pained me especially to see our name, Asbury, in flames,"" the Rev. Dr. Ianther M. Mills, the senior pastor at Asbury church said in a statement Sunday. “For me it was reminiscent of cross burnings. Seeing this act on video made me both indignant and determined to fight the evil that has reared its ugly head.”

Swift backlash for Brazil students targeting misinformation
RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Before dawn on Dec. 1, Leonardo de Carvalho Leal prepared to leave his family behind in the Brazilian city of Ponta Grossa, in Parana state. His mother overwhelmed him with goodbyes and gifted him a bracelet she said had brought her luck. He fiddled with it on his wrist the entire ride to the airport, unsure when he might see her again.
“Maybe I was blaming myself a bit, for leaving so many people vulnerable,” he said in a video interview with The Associated Press, with tears welling as he recalled his departure. “But what I did was right.”
Leal and his girlfriend of six years, Mayara Stelle -- both 22-year-old law students -- this year created a Twitter account with its stated mission to call out Brazilian websites for spreading “hate speech and Fake News,” and torpedoing those sites’ advertising revenue. They garnered 410,000 followers, more than the number of residents in their mid-size city.
They also mustered a legion of enemies. Vitriol poured in, directed toward their account, Sleeping Giants Brazil. Believing their identities are soon to be revealed after a ruling against Twitter, they expect they will be personally targeted, for lawsuits or worse.
Fear their families would be caught in the barrage because they had often accessed the account at their parents’ homes, they say, is why they left their lives behind and are choosing to make their identities known to The Associated Press and Folha de S.Paulo, Brazil's biggest newspaper. The AP observed them accessing and using the Sleeping Giants Brazil account, and checked the names they provided against their government-issued identification cards.

Trump raises China concerns as reason to veto defense bill
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump offered a new rationale Sunday for threatening to veto the annual defense policy bill that covers the military's budget for equipment and pay raises for service members: China. He did not outline his concerns.
Republican and Democratic lawmakers say the wide-ranging defense policy bill, which the Senate sent to the president on Friday, would be tough on China and must become law as soon as possible.
Both the House and Senate passed the measure by margins large enough to override a potential veto from the president, who has a history of failing to carry out actions he has threatened.
“The biggest winner of our new defense bill is China! I will veto!” Trump said in a new tweet.
The White House did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on Trump’s specific concerns about China.

Gunman shot by police at NYC cathedral Christmas concert
NEW YORK (AP) — A man was shot by police on the steps of a landmark New York City cathedral Sunday afternoon after he began firing a gun at the end of a Christmas choral concert.
Police said there was no indication anyone but the suspected gunman was shot. The man was taken to a hospital in critical condition.
The shooting happened just before 4 p.m. at the Cathedral Church of Saint John the Divine, mother church of the Episcopal Diocese of New York.
The 45-minute concert had just concluded and people were starting to walk away when a series of shots was heard, sending people running down Amsterdam Avenue screaming and diving to the sidewalk. Officers who had been on hand to provide security for the event quickly moved in and shot the gunman, who police believe was armed with a rifle.
After the gunfire stopped, a large group of police officers, guns drawn, approached the suspected gunman as he lay wounded at the top of the steps, near the cathedral's huge doors.

Silent nights: Germany tightens virus lockdown over holidays
BERLIN (AP) — Most stores shut, tight limits on social contacts, no singing in church and a ban on fireworks sales: Germany is ratcheting up its pandemic restrictions in an effort to cut the stubbornly high rate of coronavirus infections.
Chancellor Angela Merkel said she and the governors of Germany's 16 states agreed Sunday to step up the country's lockdown measures beginning Wednesday to Jan. 10 to stop the country's exponential rise of COVID-19 cases.
“We are forced to act and we’re acting,” Merkel told reporters in Berlin, noting that existing restrictions imposed in November had failed to significantly reduce the number of new infections.
The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Germany has risen over the past two weeks from 21.23 new cases per 100,000 people on Nov. 28 to 26 new cases per 100,000 people on Dec. 12.
Starting Wednesday, schools nationwide will be closed or switch to home schooling; most non-food stores will be shuttered, as will businesses such as hairdressers that have so far been allowed to remain open. Restaurant takeout will still be permitted, but no eating or drinking can take place on site."

'I'm going to tell them there's an African American man threatening my life,' she said. While overshadowed by subsequent events, the incident has led legislator all over the country to introduce bills that would make such false reports illegal or hate crimes. 
In California, Assemblymember Mark Stone has amended AB 1472, which would make false reports to police, including 911 calls, a violation of the Ralph Civil Rights Act when made against a person because of that person's race or other protected characteristic. This bill would also allow for civil action against persons who make false police reports or claims, regardless of discriminatory motive. 'Across California and across the country, people are again demanding that those of us in elected office deal with the systemic, institutionalized racism inherent in law enforcement and other governmental systems. Black Americans are overpoliced and subject to higher rates of police brutality, use-of-force, harassment, arrest, and incarceration,' said Assemblymember Mark Stone. He added, 'This violent oppression is devastating to Black communities and contributes to higher rates of mortality and poverty, among a multitude of other negative outcomes. In addition to Black communities, American Indian/Alaskan native and Latinx communities are also disproportionately affected by policing in America.' There have been many highly publicized examples of unnecessary or patently false calls to law enforcement that threaten people of color. The incident of Amy Cooper, a white woman in New York who falsely claimed that a Black man was threatening her life after he requested that she follow park rules about leashing her dog. But there is also Jennifer Schulte, a white woman who requested police response to a Black family who was barbequing at a lake in Oakland. Such acts weaponize the police, endanger lives, and contribute to the over-policing of Black communities. Filing a false or unnecessary police report motivated by racial bias, whether purposeful or simply reckless, is a discriminatory act. AB 1472 amends the Ralph Civil Rights Act to specify that 'intimidation by threat of violence' will include claims be defined to include claims or reports made to law enforcement 'that falsely alleges that another person has engaged in unlawful activity, or an activity that requires law enforcement intervention, knowing that the claim or report is false, or with reckless disregard to for the truth or falsity of the claim or report.' AB 1472 will specify that making a false report to the police, knowing that it is false or with reckless disregard to its truth or falsity, constitutes an 'intimidation by threat of violence' under the Ralph Act. Further, AB 1472 will specify that a police communication made 'knowing that the claim or report is false, or with reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of the claim or report' is not privileged publications. This would prevent a person who makes a report in violation of the Ralph Act from raising 'privileged communication' as a defense, and it would also allow for civil actions on other grounds even if the false report is not motivated by bias against a protected characteristic. This bill is currently in the Senate and is waiting in Senate Rules for referral.

""I think it's kind of a knee-jerk reaction,"" said Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a progressive Democrat, during a telephone press conference. ""I think there needs to be significant reforms ... [but] to get rid of the police department - who would respond to calls for service for violence and domestic abuse?"" 
The death of George Floyd at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis triggered a massive outpouring of grief and activism nationwide, with state and local leaders rushing to announce plans for abating police brutality and addressing systemic racism in law enforcement. 
Although it's within driving distance of New York and Philadelphia, major cities that withstood days of protests that frequently ended in violent confrontations between demonstrators and police, similar events in Newark - a city that still bears the scars of some of the worst civil unrest of the 1960s - remained almost entirely peaceful.
Baraka's comments on Thursday came as he touted an ordinance passed by the City Council on Wednesday that aims to accomplish at least some of the ""defund"" movement's goals. The ordinance calls for reallocating 5 percent of Newark's annual public safety budget - roughly $230 million last year - to create a dedicated Office for Violence Prevention. 
The purpose of the office - which will be housed in a Central Ward police precinct that was ground zero for the 1967 riot that was prompted by the beating of a black man by two white police officers - will be to ameliorate community-based conflicts and ""eliminate hate crimes and racism, racial discrimination, police brutality and violence of all kind,"" according to the ordinance. 
Final funding for the office remains contingent on the city's annual budget process, said Baraka. 
""At the end of the day, I think that the city and the residents here need police officers in their communities,"" said the mayor, adding that questions about how officers are deployed and how they engage residents should be scrutinized. 
Before being elected mayor in 2014, Baraka was an educator and longtime Newark activist who once compared the majority-minority city's long-troubled police department to an ""occupying army."" 
Baraka's rise to power, coupled with a federal consent decree entered in 2016, led to a wide range of reforms designed to stem police violence and improve community relations. 
Prior to the federal consent consent decree, Baraka pushed through an ordinance that established a Civilian Complaint Review Board - which is the subject of a case before the state Supreme Court brought by the local police union and supported by state Attorney General Gurbir Grewal - and sought changes in how police officers are trained.
During Thursday's press conference, Newark Public Safety Director Anthony Ambrose estimated that 25 percent of the department's calls for service aren't related to police work and frequently involve mental health episodes or issues relating to drug and alcohol addiction. 
Floyd's death, along with those of other people of color killed during encounters with law enforcement, have injected momentum into efforts to enact similar police reforms nationwide. 
It's also ignited a push on the part of activists to ""defund the police,"" an effort that's forced many elected Democrats like Baraka to thread a difficult needle - encouraging structural changes without upsetting prominent progressive activists who have advanced the movement. 
New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, also a Democrat and one of Baraka's most prominent political allies, declined to take a position on defunding law enforcement during an appearance on POLITICO Playbook Live earlier this week, saying ""it's not a simple 'yes' or 'no' question ... This is a lot more complicated.""
Defunding the department won't address underlying problems of structural racism and poverty, said Baraka, adding that ""all of America's institutions have the same problems the police department has.""
""The police just have guns."""

ByRichard Hall in Houston",FALSE,"The former vice president Joe Bidenyesterday led calls for racial justice as he spoke at the funeral of George Floyd, whose death at the hands of police has sparked worldwide protests for equality.
His funeral was both personal and political. Inside the cavernous Fountain of Praise church in Houston, Texas, gospel songs played as images of Mr Floyd wereshown on a large screen, interspersed with video from the marches inspired by his death.
Speaking to the church by video link, MrBiden, the presumptiveDemocratic presidential candidate in November's election, addressed Mr Floyd's six-year-old daughter.
""When there is justice for George Floyd, we will truly be on our way to racial justice in America. Then, Gianna, your daddy will have changed the world,"" he said.
""We cannot leave this moment thinking we can once again turn away from racism that stings at our very soul, from systemic abuse that still plagues American life.""
In an emotional eulogy, Mr Floyd's niece, Brooke Williams, paid tribute to her uncle and issued a call to action.
""My uncle was a father and a brother. He always moved people with his words,"" she said, fighting to hold back tears. ""That officer showed no remorse while watching my uncle's soul leaving his body.""
""I can breathe. And as long as I'm breathing, justice will be served,"" she continued. ""Someone said make America great again, but when has America ever been great? This wasn't just a murder, this was a hate crime.""
Mr Floyd, 46, was killed by a Minneapolis police officer who placed his knee on his neck for more than eight minutes, despite his persistent pleas that he could not breathe.
In death, Mr Floyd became a symbol of the racial injustice that has haunted America for hundreds of years, and the face of an anti-racism movement that has spread around the world.
Mr Floyd's death was just one in a long line of violent racial killings that shocked the US, but have so far failed to move it to action. His family was joined by the relatives of some of those other victims at the ceremony: Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Ahmaud Arbery and Trayvon Martin.
The Rev Al Sharpton paid tribute to the relatives during his eulogy.
He told mourners: ""This is a time that we need to understand that they are going to do everything they can to delay these trials and delay the countability and try to wear this family down.
""Many that are standing and coming today ... will not be here for the long run. We must commit to this family, all of these families ... that until these people pay for what they did, we are going to be there with them. Lives like George's will not matter until somebody pays for the cost of taking their lives.""
Mass demonstrations have rocked the United States in the two weeks since he was killed, but they have also spread around the world, to London, Paris and Berlin.
More than 6,000 people came to the same church on Monday for a public memorial. Today, a smaller crowd gathered for the private ceremony, wearing T-shirts emblazoned with Mr Floyd's last words: ""I can't breathe.""
Gary Birch, 55, travelled seven hours by car from Oklahoma City to pay his respects.
""We wanted to show our support because this is going to be part of history. The word has changed. We just wanted to be here,"" he said outsidethe church.
""Hopefully one day we can get to a place where racism isn't part of this country. Right now it's still very alive. We have to fight against it.""
In a busy day of tweeting, Donald Trump had not mentioned Mr Floyd's funeral by the time it was under way, instead focusing on issues including the police response to protests, insulting his former defence secretary James Mattis and spreading a conspiracy theory about a man in his 70s who was pushed to the ground and seriously injured while talking to police in Buffalo, New York."

 This summer, a bipartisan group of about a hundred academics, journalists, pollsters, former government officials and former campaign staff members convened for an initiative called the Transition Integrity Project. By video conference, they met to game out hypothetical threats to the November election and a peaceful transfer of power if the Democratic candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden, were to win. Dividing into Team Trump and Team Biden, the group ran various scenarios about counting ballots and the litigation and protests and violence that could follow a contested election result. The idea was to test the machinery of American democracy.
 Describing the results in a Sept. 3 essay in The Washington Post, one of the project's organizers, Rosa Brooks, a Georgetown law professor and Pentagon official during the Obama administration, mentioned a situation in which Biden won the popular vote but lost in the Electoral College. In that hypothetical case, ''desperate Democrats'' on Team Biden considered encouraging California and the Pacific Northwest to threaten secession to pressure Republicans to expand the size of the Senate.
 The next day, Michael Anton, a former national security adviser to President Trump, published an article about the Transition Integrity Project called ''The Coming Coup?'' Democrats were ''laying the groundwork for revolution,'' Anton wrote without evidence in The American Mind, a publication of the Claremont Institute. He warned that ballots harvested ''lawfully or not'' could tip close states to Biden.

 By mid-September, Anton's article was one of the most-shared links in extremist online communities, according to a newsletter published by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a think tank based in London. Dan Bongino, a podcaster and Trump supporter, covered Anton's essay and the imagined coup in several videos, with one tagged, ''They are telling you what they are going to do!'' Just two of the videos pulled in at least six million views.
 On Sept. 9, a post appeared on Revolver News, a new right-wing website. It claimed without evidence that one participant in the Transition Integrity Project, Norm Eisen, who served as a counsel for the Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee during the impeachment proceedings, was a ''central operative'' in a ''color revolution'' against Trump, a term for uprisings that have toppled governments in countries like Georgia and Ukraine. Trump tweeted in praise of Revolver News a few days later.
 On Sept. 15, the Fox News host Tucker Carlson had on his show Darren Beattie, a former Trump speechwriter who was fired after reports surfaced that he had attended a gathering of white nationalists in 2016 and who warned about Eisen and a color revolution. Two days later, Trump tweeted that ''the Nov 3rd Election result may NEVER BE ACCURATELY DETERMINED, which is what some want,'' generating tens of thousands of interactions on Twitter and a round of news coverage about one of the fears that the Transition Integrity Project sought to address -- that Trump could refuse to accept the results of the election.
 All told, in September the coup fabrication was shared more than 100,000 times from public Facebook pages, generating many millions of interactions and video views, according to the data source CrowdTangle. Alongside Bongino and Fox News, there were small drivers of traffic like Long Islanders for Trump, the Silent Majority Group and a county Republican organization in Oregon, as well as private groups with thousands of members that CrowdTangle doesn't capture. By the end of the month, the fraction of Republicans who were not ''confident'' that the election ''will be conducted in a fair and equal way'' hit 65 percent, higher than it was for independents or Democrats, in an NBC News/SurveyMonkey tracking poll. This month, Trump retweeted a response to a Republican member of Congress, Mark Green, who suggested that Speaker Nancy Pelosi could stage a coup.
 The United States is in the middle of a catastrophic public-health crisis caused by the spread of the coronavirus. But it is also in the midst of an information crisis caused by the spread of viral disinformation, defined as falsehoods aimed at achieving a political goal. (''Misinformation'' refers more generally to falsehoods.) Seven months into the pandemic in America, with Trump leading the way, coronavirus skeptics continue to mock masks and incorrectly equate the virus with the flu. Throughout the campaign season, Trump and other Republicans have promoted a false narrative of widespread voter fraud, which Attorney General William Barr, as the country's top law-enforcement official, furthered in a September interview on CNN when he said someone in Texas was indicted for filling out 1,700 ballots for other people, which never happened. As fires tore through California and the Pacific Northwest last month, the president cast doubt on the science behind global warming, and people in Oregon defied evacuation orders because of false rumors that antifa, a loose term for left-wing activists, was setting the blazes and looting empty homes.
 The conspiracy theories, the lies, the distortions, the overwhelming amount of information, the anger encoded in it -- these all serve to create chaos and confusion and make people, even nonpartisans, exhausted, skeptical and cynical about politics. The spewing of falsehoods isn't meant to win any battle of ideas. Its goal is to prevent the actual battle from being fought, by causing us to simply give up. And the problem isn't just the internet. A working paper from the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard released early this month found that effective disinformation campaigns are often an ''elite-driven, mass-media led process'' in which ''social media played only a secondary and supportive role.'' Trump's election put him in the position to operate directly through Fox News and other conservative media outlets, like Rush Limbaugh's talk-radio show, which have come to function ''in effect as a party press,'' the Harvard researchers found.
 The false story about Democrats plotting a coup spread through a typical feedback loop. Links from Fox News hosts and other right-wing figures aligned with Trump, like Bongino, often dominate the top links in Facebook's News Feed for likes, comments and shares in the United States. Though Fox News is far smaller than Facebook, the social media platform has helped Fox attain the highest weekly reach, offline and online combined, of any single news source in the United States, according to a 2020 report by the Reuters Institute.
 It's an article of faith in the United States that more speech is better and that the government should regulate it as little as possible. But increasingly, scholars of constitutional law, as well as social scientists, are beginning to question the way we have come to think about the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech. They think our formulations are simplistic -- and especially inadequate for our era. Censorship of external critics by the government remains a serious threat under authoritarian regimes. But in the United States and other democracies, there is a different kind of threat, which may be doing more damage to the discourse about politics, news and science. It encompasses the mass distortion of truth and overwhelming waves of speech from extremists that smear and distract.
 This concern spans the ideological spectrum. Along with disinformation campaigns, there is the separate problem of ''troll armies'' -- a flood of commenters, often propelled by bots -- that ''aim to discredit or to destroy the reputation of disfavored speakers and to discourage them from speaking again,'' Jack Goldsmith, a conservative law professor at Harvard, writes in an essay in ''The Perilous Public Square,'' a book edited by David E. Pozen that was published this year. This tactic, too, may be directed by those in power. Either way, it's often grimly effective at muting critical voices. And yet as Tim Wu, a progressive law professor at Columbia, points out in the same book, the ''use of speech as a tool to suppress speech is, by its nature, something very challenging for the First Amendment to deal with.''
 These scholars argue something that may seem unsettling to Americans: that perhaps our way of thinking about free speech is not the best way. At the very least, we should understand that it isn't the only way. Other democracies, in Europe and elsewhere, have taken a different approach. Despite more regulations on speech, these countries remain democratic; in fact, they have created better conditions for their citizenry to sort what's true from what's not and to make informed decisions about what they want their societies to be. Here in the United States, meanwhile, we're drowning in lies.
 Facts and transparency are the intended pillars of the modern First Amendment. Since the nation's founding, the Constitution has guaranteed that the government ''shall make no law'' abridging ''the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble.'' For more than a century, however, these limits on the state's power were worth little. From 1798 to 1801, more than two dozen people, including several newspaper editors, were prosecuted by the administration of President John Adams under the Alien and Sedition Acts, which made ''malicious writing'' a crime. Protesters were also jailed for criticizing the government during World War I.
 In 1919, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. invoked the First Amendment to dispute the legality of prosecuting five anarchists for distributing leaflets that called for workers to strike at munitions factories. ''The ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas,'' Holmes wrote.
 One of Holmes's chief influences was the British philosopher John Stuart Mill, who argued in his foundational 1859 treatise ''On Liberty'' that it is wrong to censor ideas, because knowledge arises from the ''the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error.'' In the process, the capacity of citizens to weigh policy questions is strengthened. The government should not censor false or harmful speech because its judgment might be wrong.
 Based on Mill's conception of free speech, the political theorist Alexander Meiklejohn argued for elevating the right above other rights, as the foundation of democracy, in his 1948 book ''Free Speech and its Relation to Self-Government.'' Mill and Meiklejohn stand for the proposition that unfettered debate -- Holmes's ''free trade in ideas,'' or the ''marketplace of ideas,'' coined by Justice William O. Douglas in 1953 -- furthers the bedrock values of the pursuit of truth, individual autonomy and democratic self-governance.
 In the 1960s, based on these principles, Supreme Court majorities laid the cornerstones of modern American free-speech protections. In the case Brandenburg v. Ohio, the justices struck down an Ohio law used to arrest a Ku Klux Klan leader for speaking at a rally, barring the government from punishing speech unless it encouraged and was likely to cause ''imminent lawless action,'' like a riot. In the foundational case New York Times v. Sullivan, the court made it difficult for a public figure to sue a newspaper for libel that included false statements. Errors were ''inevitable in free debate,'' the court said, and ''must be protected if the freedoms of expression are to have the 'breathing space' that they 'need,''' quoting a previous ruling.
 It's a fundamentally optimistic vision: Good ideas win. The better argument will prove persuasive.
 There's a countertradition, however. It's alert to the ways in which demagogic leaders or movements can use propaganda, an older term that can be synonymous with disinformation. A crude authoritarian censors free speech. A clever one invokes it to play a trick, twisting facts to turn a mob on a subordinated group and, in the end, silence as well as endanger its members. Looking back at the rise of fascism and the Holocaust in her 1951 book ''The Origins of Totalitarianism,'' the political philosopher Hannah Arendt focused on the use of propaganda to ''make people believe the most fantastic statements one day, and trust that if the next day they were given irrefutable proof of their falsehood, they would take refuge in cynicism.''
 In other words, good ideas do not necessarily triumph in the marketplace of ideas. ''Free speech threatens democracy as much as it also provides for its flourishing,'' the philosopher Jason Stanley and the linguist David Beaver argue in their forthcoming book, ''The Politics of Language.''
 Concerns about the harm of unfettered speech have flared on the left in the United States since the 1970s. In that decade, some feminists, led by the legal scholar Catharine A. MacKinnon and the activist Andrea Dworkin, fought to limit access to pornography, which they viewed as a form of subordination and a violation of women's civil rights. In the 1980s and '90s, scholars developing critical race theory, which examines the role of law in maintaining race-based divisions of power, called for a reading of the First Amendment that recognized racist hate speech as an injury that courts could redress.
 But the Supreme Court has strongly protected hate speech. In 1992, the Supreme Court unanimously said that the City of St. Paul could not specially punish, as a hate crime, the public burning of a cross or the display of a swastika. In 2011, in an 8-to-1 vote, the court said the government could not stop members of the Westboro Baptist Church in Kansas from picketing military funerals across the nation to protest what they perceived to be the government's tolerance of homosexuality by holding signs like ''Thank God for Dead Soldiers.'' Speech can ''inflict great pain,'' Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote for the majority. ''On the facts before us, we cannot react to that pain by punishing the speaker. As a Nation we have chosen a different course -- to protect even hurtful speech on public issues to ensure that we do not stifle public debate.''
 In 2012, by a 6-to-3 vote in United States v. Alvarez, the court provided some constitutional protection for an individual's intentional lies, at least as long as they don't cause serious harm. The majority said that the ''mere potential'' for government censorship casts ''a chill the First Amendment cannot permit if free speech, thought and discourse are to remain a foundation of our freedom.''
 The Supreme Court has also taken the First Amendment in another direction that had nothing to do with individual rights, moving from preserving a person's freedom to dissent to entrenching the power of wealthy interests. In the 1970s, the court started protecting corporate campaign spending alongside individual donations. Legally speaking, corporate spending on speech that was related to elections was akin to the shouting of protesters. This was a ''radical break with the history and traditions of U.S. law,'' the Harvard law professor John Coates wrote in a 2015 article published by the University of Minnesota Law School. Over time, the shift helped to fundamentally alter the world of politics. In the 2010 Citizens United decision, the court's conservative majority opened the door to allowing corporations (and unions) to spend unlimited amounts on political advocacy, as long as they donated to interest groups and political-action committees rather than to campaigns.
 By requiring the state to treat alike categories of speakers -- corporations and individuals -- the Supreme Court began to go far beyond preventing discrimination based on viewpoint or the identity of an individual speaker. ''Once a defense of the powerless, the First Amendment over the last hundred years has mainly become a weapon of the powerful,'' MacKinnon, now a law professor at the University of Michigan, wrote in ''The Free Speech Century,'' a 2018 essay collection. Instead of ''radicals, artists and activists, socialists and pacifists, the excluded and the dispossessed,'' she wrote, the First Amendment now serves ''authoritarians, racists and misogynists, Nazis and Klansmen, pornographers and corporations buying elections.'' In the same year, Justice Elena Kagan warned that the court's conservative majority was ''weaponizing the First Amendment'' in the service of corporate interests, in a dissent to a ruling against labor unions.
 If Trump's deeply conservative third Supreme Court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, is confirmed, the court will most likely become more committed to its path of using the First Amendment to empower corporations. Somewhere along the way, the conservative majority has lost sight of an essential point: The purpose of free speech is to further democratic participation. ''The crucial function of protecting speech is to give persons the sense that the government is theirs, which we might call democratic legitimation,'' says the Yale law professor Robert Post. ''Campbell Soup Company can't experience democratic legitimation. But a person can. If we lose one election, we can win the next one. We can continue to identify with the democratic process so long as we're given the opportunity to shape public opinion. That's why we have the First Amendment.''
 On May 16, 2017, Fox News posted an article that drew on a report from the local Fox station in Washington, laying out a conspiracy theory about the death of Seth Rich, a staff member at the Democratic National Committee who was apparently the victim of an attempted street robbery. The story falsely implicated Rich in the Russian hacking of committee emails, which were released by WikiLeaks during the 2016 presidential campaign. Sean Hannity amplified the lies about Rich on his Fox News show that night and the former House speaker Newt Gingrich repeated them on ''Fox & Friends'' a few days later. The falsehoods spread to conspiracy websites and social media. Fox News retracted its false report online a week later, but ''Fox & Friends'' did not; Hannity said on his radio show, ''I retracted nothing.'' An ABC affiliate owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group, a conservative owner of local TV stations, then aired another report on the Rich conspiracy theory, which the local Fox station covered, giving it life for another news cycle.
 In a 2018 book, ''Network Propaganda,'' Yochai Benkler, a director of the Berkman Klein Center at Harvard, and two researchers there, Robert Faris and Hal Roberts, mapped the spread of political disinformation in the United States from 2015 to 2018. Analyzing the hyperlinks of four million news articles, the three authors found that the conservative media did not counter lies and distortions, but rather recycled them from one outlet to the next, on TV and radio and through like-minded websites.
 The dearth of competition for factual accuracy among conservative outlets leaves their audiences vulnerable to disinformation even if the mainstream news media combats it. People are more likely to believe fact-checking from a source that speaks against its apparent political interest, research shows. In the eyes of many conservatives, news outlets like The Washington Post, The New York Times and CNN do not fill that role when they challenge a story that Trump and Fox News promote.
 Mainstream publications also make mistakes or run with a hyped narrative. The repeated front-page coverage that The New York Times gave to Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server, after breaking the story, shadowed her defeat in 2016. It was also skewered by press critics -- an example of how competing outlets challenge and correct one another (even if the system sometimes fails in real time). This ''reality-check dynamic'' in the mainstream and left-leaning media, Benkler, Faris and Roberts write, ''still leaves plenty of room for partisanship.'' But the standards of journalism, however flawed, appear to ''significantly constrain disinformation.''
 In the past, ensuring a vibrant free press made up of competing outlets was an express aim of federal policy. From the founding until the early 20th century, Congress lowered the cost of starting and running a newspaper or magazine by setting low postage rates for mailed copies. The advent of radio raised questions about how to foster competition and public access. ''Lawmakers of both parties recognized the danger that an information chokehold poses to democratic self-government,'' says Ellen P. Goodman, a law professor at Rutgers University. ''So policymakers adopted structures to ensure diversity of ownership, local control of media and public broadcasting.''
 In 1927, when Congress created the licensing system for exclusive rights to the broadcast spectrum, so that radio broadcasters could secure a place on the dial, lawmakers told broadcasters to act ''as if people of a community should own a station.'' The 1934 Communications Act similarly required anyone with a broadcast license to operate in the ''public interest'' and allocated spectrum based on ensuring that local communities had their own stations. In 1949, the Federal Communications Commission established the fairness doctrine, which interpreted operating in the public interest to require broadcasters to cover major public-policy debates and present multiple points of view. And in 1967, Congress created and funded the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, whose mission is to ''promote an educated and informed civil society,'' and reserved broadcast spectrum for local NPR and PBS stations.
 During these decades, broadcasters were held to a standard of public trusteeship, in which the right to use the airwaves came with a mandate to provide for democratic discourse. Broadcasters made money -- lots of it -- but profit wasn't their only reason for existing. ''The networks had a public-service obligation, and when they went to get their licenses renewed, the news divisions fulfilled that,'' says Matthew Gentzkow, an economist at Stanford who studies trust in information. The model coincided with a rare period, in American history, of relatively high levels of trust in media and low levels of political polarization.
 But public trusteeship for broadcast and diverse ownership began to unravel with the libertarian shift of the Reagan era. In the mid-1980s, the administration waived the F.C.C. rule that barred a single entity from owning a TV station and a daily newspaper in the same local market to allow Rupert Murdoch to continue to own The New York Post and The Boston Herald after he bought his first broadcast TV stations in New York and Boston.
 The F.C.C. repealed the fairness doctrine, which had required broadcasters to include multiple points of view, in 1987. ''When that went, that was the beginning of the complete triumph, in media, of the libertarian view of the First Amendment,'' the Rutgers law professor Goodman says.
 Murdoch and Roger Ailes, a former Nixon campaign adviser, started Fox News as the first TV network to cultivate a conservative audience in 1996. A decade later, studies showed what has become known as the Fox News Effect: After a local cable system adds Fox News to the lineup, voters in the vicinity tend to shift toward Republican candidates. As Trump's ally and frequent platform, Fox News can help shift its audience's behavior toward his views even when they may risk public health. In a study this year, a team of economists, controlling for other factors, found that communities with higher numbers of Fox News viewers were less likely to comply with stay-at-home orders to fight coronavirus.
 In the early '90s, David D. Smith, a conservative who inherited the Sinclair Broadcast Group from his father, bought a second local TV station in Pittsburgh, despite a federal regulation barring the ownership of more than one station in a local market. In Baltimore, Sinclair got around the same rule by creating another company, Glencairn, controlled by Smith's mother and an employee. Sinclair is growing as local journalism is hollowing out: About 1,800 metro and community newspapers have closed or merged since 2004. Sinclair is now the largest station owner in swing states.
 More than three-quarters of Americans say they trust local TV news, according to a recent survey by the Poynter Institute. Sinclair owns local affiliates of CBS, ABC, NBC and the CW, as well as Fox, so its partisan leanings aren't immediately apparent. But they're there. ''We are here to deliver your message -- period.'' Smith reportedly told Trump during the 2016 campaign. In early 2018, dozens of Sinclair newscasters across the country echoed Trump's diatribes against the press by reading from the same script warning of ''fake stories'' from ''some members'' of the media. (Deadspin captured the repetition of the script in an eerie video montage.) In July, Sinclair released online an interview with Judy Mikovits, a conspiracy theorist who has accused Dr. Anthony Fauci of manufacturing the coronavirus. When the segment drew criticism, the company canceled the planned on-air broadcast but called itself ''a supporter of free speech and a marketplace of ideas and viewpoints, even if incredibly controversial.''
 The founding ethos of the internet was to treat sources of information equally. Cut loose from traditional gatekeepers -- the publishing industry and the government -- the web would provide the world's first neutral delivery of content. But in short order, the libertarian principles that weakened media regulation allowed a few American tech companies to become the new gatekeepers. The United States gave platforms like Google, Facebook and Twitter free rein to grow. Google bought YouTube. Facebook bought Instagram and WhatsApp.
 The business model for the dominant platforms depends on keeping users engaged online. Content that prompts hot emotion tends to succeed at generating clicks and shares, and that's what the platforms' algorithms tend to promote. Lies go viral more quickly than true statements, research shows.
 In many ways, social media sites today function as the public square. But legally speaking, internet platforms can restrict free speech far more than the government can. They're like malls, where private owners police conduct. Facebook, YouTube and Twitter have guidelines that moderate content that could drive away users, including spam and pornography, and also certain forms of harassment, hate speech, fake engagement or misrepresentation and violent extremism. But for years, the companies enforced these rules subjectively and unevenly -- allowing for explosions of anti-Semitic memes and targeted harassment of women, for example.
 Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Jack Dorsey of Twitter have each said that their sites cannot be ''arbiters of truth'' and make important exceptions to their guidelines. Facebook leaves up content, including hate speech, that breaks the rules when it decides it's newsworthy, because it's a post from a politician or a public figure. ''In the same way that news outlets will report what a politician says,'' Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post in June, ''we think people should generally be able to see it for themselves on our platforms.''
 Social media sites have leaned on First Amendment principles to keep secret the identities of people who appear to abuse their services. Following the right-wing news coverage of the conspiracy theory about Seth Rich, his brother subpoenaed Twitter, in a defamation suit against media companies, to uncover the name of the person behind the Twitter account @whysprtech, alleging that person sent to Fox News a forged F.B.I. document about Rich's case. Twitter fought back in court, saying that unmasking @whysprtech would chill speech by violating what the platform's lawyers called a constitutional right to be anonymous. This month, a judge ordered Twitter to reveal information that could unmask the person or people behind @whysprtech.
 Over the past two months, as Trump attacked mail-in voting and the validity of the November election results, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter said they would impose a few more controls on speech about voting. The platforms expanded or reaffirmed their policies for removing a narrow category of content that misleads people about how to vote -- for example, by saying you can fill out a ballot online.
 In September, Facebook and YouTube joined Twitter in adding labels to content that a fact check has noted could undermine the results of the election or mislead about the results. (Facebook contracts with an independent fact-checking network, which includes both The Associated Press and Check Your Fact, a subsidiary of the right-wing outlet The Daily Caller. Twitter does fact-checking internally. YouTube relies on a network of news organizations, including PolitiFact and The Washington Post Fact Checker.)
 Fact-checking and labeling are First Amendment-friendly responses. They counter false speech with more speech, at the initiative of a private company, not the direction of the government. Today the research consensus among social scientists is that some fact-checking methods significantly reduce the prevalence of false beliefs. In print or on TV, journalists can use headlines or chyrons to provide context and debunking in real time -- though they sometimes fail to do so.
 Until very recently, Facebook and Twitter used mild labeling language. On Sept. 28, Trump tweeted: ''The Ballots being returned to States cannot be accurately counted. Many things are already going very wrong!'' In small blue print at the bottom of the post, Twitter added a warning symbol -- a small exclamation point in a circle -- along with the text ''Learn how voting by mail is safe and secure.'' Facebook labeled the same post, suggesting that voters visit its ''Voting Information Center'' without including a warning symbol.
 Kate Starbird, a professor of human-computer interaction at the University of Washington who tracks social media disinformation, called Facebook's label ''worse than nothing.'' Adding a weak label to a Trump post mostly has the effect of ''giving it an attention bump by creating a second news cycle about Republican charges of bias in content moderation,'' says Nathaniel Persily, a Stanford law professor and co-director of the university's Program on Democracy and the Internet.
 Facebook has since updated its labels, based on tests and feedback, including from civil rights leaders. ''The labels we have now, we have far more than we used to,'' says Monika Bickert, Facebook's vice president for content policy. ''They've gotten stronger. But I would expect we'll continue to refine them as we keep seeing what's working.'' Facebook updated the label on Trump's Sept. 28 tweet to ''Both voting in person and voting by mail have a long history of trustworthiness in the US and the same is predicted this year. Source: Bipartisan Policy Center.'' On an Oct. 6 Trump post with more falsehoods about voting, Facebook added an additional sentence to that label: ''Voter fraud is extremely rare across voting methods.'' (Other labels, though, remain mild, and plenty of misleading content related to voting remains unlabeled.)
 Angelo Carusone, the president of Media Matters for America, a nonprofit media watchdog group, finds the changes useful but frustratingly late. ''We went from them refusing to touch any of the content, an entire ocean of disinformation on voting and election integrity, and dismissal of any efforts to address that -- to this. They let it metastasize, and now they start doing the thing they could have done all along.'' Carusone also points out that independent researchers don't have access to data that would allow them to study key questions about the companies' claims of addressing disinformation. How prevalent are disinformation and hate speech on the platforms? Are people who see Facebook, Twitter and YouTube's information labels less likely to share false and misleading content? Which type of warning has the greatest impact?
 Twitter and Facebook reduce the spread of some false posts, but during this election season, Starbird has watched false content shared or retweeted tens of thousands of times or more before companies make any visible effort to address it. ''Currently, we are watching disinformation go viral & trying desperately to refute it,'' she tweeted in September. ''By the time we do -- even in cases where platforms end up taking action -- the false info/narrative has already done its damage.''
 Facebook came under intense criticism for the role it played in the last presidential race. During the 2016 campaign, Facebook later reported, Russian operatives spent about $100,000 to buy some 3,000 ads meant to benefit Trump largely by sowing racial division. By choosing Facebook, a small investment had an outsize payoff as the site's users circulated the planted ads to their followers. ''Facebook's scale means we've concentrated our risk,'' says Brendan Nyhan, a political scientist at Dartmouth College. ''When they're wrong, they're wrong on a national or global scale.''
 Facebook and YouTube have treated political ads as protected speech, allowing them to include false and misleading information. Online ads -- like direct mail and robocalls -- can make setting the record straight very difficult. Online advertisers can use microtargeting to pinpoint the segments of users they want to reach. ''Misleading TV ads can be countered and fact-checked,'' while a misleading message in a microtargeted ad ''remains hidden from challenge by the other campaign or the media,'' Zeynep Tufekci, a sociologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the author of the 2017 book ''Twitter and Tear Gas,'' wrote in a prescient 2012 Op-Ed in The New York Times.
 In this election season, domestic groups are adopting similar tactics. This summer, the Trump-aligned group FreedomWorks, which was seeded by the billionaire Koch brothers, promoted 150 Facebook ads directing people to a page with a picture of LeBron James. The image was accompanied by a quote, in which James denounced poll closures as racist, that was repurposed to deceive people into thinking he was discouraging voting by mail. After The Washington Post reported on it, Facebook removed the page for violating its voter-interference policy, but only after the ads were seen hundreds of thousands of times.
 Coordinated fake accounts posting about the election have also shown up on Twitter. In August, NBC News reported on a series of viral tweets that appeared to be from Black men who said they were lifelong Democrats and planned to leave the party. The accounts were fake; one used a stock photo of a Black man, and the other used a photo of a Dutch model. Twitter eventually took them down. The company recently said that as of Oct. 20, it is making more changes to protect the election, including temporarily warning users if they try to share content that the platform has flagged as false.
 Another reason political ads are controversial online is that campaigns or groups that pay for them don't have to disclose their identities, as they're required to do on TV and radio and in print. ''The First Amendment value of individual autonomy means we should know who is speaking to us and why,'' the Rutgers law professor Goodman argues. But online, neither the Supreme Court nor Congress has stepped in to require disclosure.
 Twitter banned political ads a year ago. This month, Facebook said it would temporarily ban political ads after the polls close on Nov. 3. Last month, the company took another step to protect the U.S. election. It restricted its Messenger app by preventing mass forwarding of private messages, which has done terrible damage in other countries. For several years, falsehoods that were forwarded from person to person, and from group to group, in private encrypted messages on WhatsApp sparked riots and fatal beatings against religious and ethnic minorities in countries including Bangladesh, India, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. In 2018, Facebook started limiting the forwarding of any post on WhatsApp to 20 people; now the limit is five for WhatsApp and Messenger.
 As social media companies have tried to address the spread of disinformation and other toxic speech, conservatives including Trump have hurled a series of accusations that the companies are showing bias against them. In May, after Twitter first added labels that read ''Get the facts about mail-in ballots'' to two Trump tweets predicting mass ballot fraud, the president signed a largely symbolic executive order directed at social media sites, calling the platforms' labels ''selective censorship that is harming our national discourse.''
 In February, The Washington Post reported on an internal effort by Facebook (called Project P, for propaganda) after the 2016 election to take down pages that spread Russian disinformation. The project foundered after Joel Kaplan, Facebook's vice president for global public policy, reportedly said at a high-level meeting, ''We can't remove all of it because it will disproportionately affect conservatives,'' according to a source at Facebook who spoke to The Post anonymously. In an email this month, a Facebook representative said Kaplan's point about Project P was that the company ''needed a clear basis for the removal because the impact would be felt more on the right than the left, and we would face criticism.''
 Kaplan has deep Republican ties. He was present at the so-called Brooks Brothers Riot in Florida shortly after the contested presidential election in 2000, when a group of Republicans in suits succeeded in stopping a recount of ballots to the benefit of their candidate, George W. Bush. In 2018, he sat behind his close friend Brett Kavanaugh during Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing for the Supreme Court. (Kaplan apologized after some of his employees objected that his appearance seemed like a Facebook endorsement of Kavanaugh.)
 Facebook employees have also raised questions about whether Facebook's misinformation policy is enforced evenhandedly. According to the policy, publications and individual users will receive a ''misinformation strike'' for a post that a fact checker determines is false or misleading. A publication with multiple misinformation strikes in 90 days is supposed to lose its eligibility to be in Facebook News, a curated section that generates traffic for publications. (The New York Times is in Facebook News.) In August, Buzzfeed reported that at an all-hands meeting the previous month, Facebook employees asked Zuckerberg how Breitbart News remained a news partner after sharing the video in which doctors called hydroxychloroquine ''a cure for Covid'' and said ''you don't need a mask.'' Through Breitbart's page, the video racked up more than 20 million views in several hours before Facebook removed it. Zuckerberg said Breitbart didn't have a second strike within the 90-day period.
 But in an internal message group, employees wrote that misinformation strikes against Breitbart had been ''cleared without explanation,'' and gathered evidence of ''preferential treatment'' to help conservative accounts in these situations, according to Buzzfeed. One of the employees was later fired; Facebook said it was because ''he broke the rules.'' When I spoke to Bickert, she said Breitbart was cleared by her team because of ''glitches'' in Facebook's system, such as not accurately notifying the publisher. This has happened ''to publishers on the left and the right,'' Bickert said.
 In the last two years, employees have left Facebook sounding an alarm. In 2019, Yael Eisenstat resigned from her role as Facebook's head of elections integrity after failing to persuade the company to combat misinformation in political ads. In a November op-ed in The Washington Post, she called on the company to stop profiting ''from providing politicians with potent information-warfare tools.'' Resigning from Facebook this summer, two software engineers, Max Wang and Ashok Chandwaney, separately accused the company of ''profiting from hatred.'' Sophie Zhang, a data scientist who was fired from Facebook in September, wrote a 6,600-word memo with details about disinformation campaigns she found to influence elections in countries including Ecuador, Honduras and Ukraine. ''I have blood on my hands,'' she wrote.
 John Stuart Mill wrote a century and a half ago that ''All silencing of discussion is an assumption of infallibility.'' There is still plenty of reason to believe that moving away from the American free-speech tradition could make us too quick to dismiss apparently false ideas that turn out to have merit -- and that airing them is the only way to find out. At Howard University's commencement in 2016, President Barack Obama warned students against pushing colleges to disinvite speakers, ''no matter how ridiculous or offensive you might find the things that come out of their mouths.'' Instead, he told them, ''beat them on the battlefield of ideas.''
 In the last several years, however, some liberals have lost patience with rehashing debates about ideas they find toxic. The American Civil Liberties Union celebrated its decision in 1977 to defend the free speech rights of Nazis to march in Skokie, Ill. Forty years later, some lawyers and board members for the A.C.L.U. objected when the group defended the neo-Nazis who demonstrated in Charlottesville, Va.
 Cancel culture -- subjecting people to professional or social penalties for their views -- has unsettled universities and workplaces. Liberal students have shouted down conservative speakers including Charles Murray and Christina Hoff Sommers. Conservatives have also condemned speakers and academics, for example, for supporting Palestinian rights. The New York Times's decision this summer to publish an Op-Ed in which Senator Tom Cotton called for sending in federal troops to crack down on protests against the police roiled the paper's staff. Citing a ''significant breakdown in our editing processes,'' the publisher, A.G. Sulzberger, announced the resignation of the editorial-page editor, James Bennet.
 The First Amendment doesn't have a formal role in these situations -- newspapers and universities can decide which views they want to promote -- but the principle that it's paramount to protect dissident speech makes them difficult to untangle. If people have the right to peacefully protest against the police, don't neo-Nazis have the same right to peacefully demonstrate? Why is Tom Cotton's Op-Ed beyond the pale but not an October Op-Ed by Regina Ip, a legislator in Hong Kong, who defended police officers' filling the streets and arresting hundreds of pro-democracy demonstrators?
 The principle of free speech has a different shape and meaning in Europe. For the European Union, as well as democracies like Canada and New Zealand, free speech is not an absolute right from which all other freedoms flow. The European high courts have allowed states to punish incitements of racial hatred or denial of the Holocaust, for example. Germany and France have laws that are designed to prevent the widespread dissemination of hate speech and election-related disinformation.''Much of the recent authoritarian experience in Europe arose out of democracy itself,'' explains Miguel Poiares Maduro, board chairman of the European Digital Media Observatory, a project on online disinformation at the European University Institute. ''The Nazis and others were originally elected. In Europe, there is historically an understanding that democracy needs to protect itself from anti-democratic ideas. It's because of the different democratic ethos of Europe that Europe has accepted more restrictions on speech.''
 After World War II, European countries also promoted free speech, and the flow of reliable information, by making large investments in public broadcasting. Today France TV, the BBC, ARD in Germany and similar broadcasters in the Netherlands and Scandinavia continue to score high in public trust and audience share. Researchers in Germany and France who have mapped the spread of political lies and conspiracy theories there say they have found pockets online, especially on YouTube, but nothing like the large-scale feedback loops in the United States that include major media outlets and even the president.
 The difference between the political-speech traditions of the United States and Europe was acutely apparent in the American and French presidential elections of 2016 and 2017. When Russian operatives hacked into the computers of the Democratic National Committee, they gave their stolen trove of D.N.C. emails to WikiLeaks, which released the emails in batches to do maximum damage to Clinton and her party in the months before the election. The news media covered the stolen emails extensively, providing information so the public could weigh it, even if a foreign adversary had planted it.
 The French press responded otherwise to a Russian hack in May 2017. Two days before a national election, the Russians posted online thousands of emails from En Marche!, the party of Emmanuel Macron, who was running for president. France, like several other democracies, has a blackout law that bars news coverage of a campaign for the 24 hours before an election and on Election Day. But the emails were available several hours before the blackout began. They were fair game. Yet the French media did not cover them. Le Monde, a major French newspaper, explained that the hack had ''the obvious purpose of undermining the integrity of the ballot.''
 Marine Le Pen, Macron's far-right opponent, accused the news media of a partisan cover-up. But she had no sympathetic outlet to turn to, because there is no equivalent of Fox News or Breitbart in France. ''The division in the French media isn't between left and right,'' said Dominique Cardon, director of the Media Lab at the university Sciences Po. ''It's between top and bottom, between professional outlets and some websites linked to very small organizations, or individuals on Facebook or Twitter or YouTube who share a lot of disinformation.'' The faint impact of the Macron hack ''is a good illustration of how it's impossible to succeed at manipulation of the news just on social media,'' said Arnaud Mercier, a professor of information and political communication at the University Paris 2 PanthÃ©on-Assas. ''The hackers needed the sustainment of the traditional media.''
 The challenge of informing the public accurately about the coronavirus has also played out differently in the U.S. and Europe. In March, the World Health Organization appealed for help with what it called an ''infodemic.'' Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and others pledged to elevate ''authoritative content'' and combat misinformation about the virus around the world.
 But in August, the global activist group Avaaz released a report showing that conspiracies and falsehoods about the coronavirus and other health issues circulated on Facebook through at least May, far more frequently than posts by authoritative sources like W.H.O. and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Avaaz included web traffic from Britain, France, Germany and Italy, along with the United States, and found that the U.S. accounted for 89 percent of the comments, likes and shares of false and misleading health information. ''A lot of U.S.-based entities are actually targeting other countries with misinformation in Italian or Spanish or Portuguese,'' said Fadi Quran, the campaign director for Avaaz. ''In our sample, the U.S. is by far the worst actor.''
 America's information crisis was not inevitable. Nor is it insoluble. Whatever the Supreme Court does, there's no legal barrier to increasing the delivery of reliable information. The government, federal or state, could invest in efforts to do exactly that. It could stop the decline of local reporting by funding nonprofit journalism. It could create new publicly funded TV or radio to create more alternatives for media that appeals across the ideological spectrum. The only obstacles to such cures for America's disinformation ills are political.
 Last spring, when Twitter started labeling Trump's misleading and false tweets about voting fraud, he called for revoking Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which Congress wrote in an early stage of the internet to help it grow. Section 230 effectively makes internet platforms, unlike other publishers, immune from libel and other civil suits for the content they carry. Biden also called for revoking Section 230 in January, citing Facebook for ''propagating falsehoods they know to be false.''
 Taking away the platforms' immunity, however, seems like a bad fit for the problems at hand. The threat of being sued for libel could encourage platforms to avoid litigation costs by pre-emptively taking down content once someone challenges it. Some of that content would be disinformation and hate speech, but other material might be offensive but true -- a risk of overcensorship.
 But there's another idea with bipartisan support: Make the platforms earn their immunity from lawsuits. The Rutgers law professor Goodman and others have proposed using Section 230 as leverage to push the platforms to be more transparent, for example, by disclosing how their algorithms order people's news feeds and recommendations and how much disinformation and hate speech they circulate. A quid pro quo could go further, requiring the companies to change their algorithms or identify super-spreaders of disinformation and slow the virality of their posts. To make sure new media sites can enter the market, the government could exempt small start-ups but impose conditions on platforms with tens of millions of users.
 Congress, as well as the Justice Department, can also promote competition through antitrust enforcement. In early October, the House Judiciary's Committee's Democratic leadership released a 449-page report, based on an extensive investigation, that said Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple have monopoly power in their markets like that of the ''oil barons and railroad tycoons'' of the early 20th century. ''Because there is not meaningful competition, dominant firms face little financial consequence when misinformation and propaganda are promoted online,'' the report stated.
 There are plenty of ideas, and bills, floating around Washington that seek to improve the online speech environment -- like the giant step of using antitrust law to break up the big tech companies, or medium-size steps like banning microtargeted political ads, requiring disclosure of the ad buyers, making the platforms file reports detailing when they remove content or reduce its spread. But the United States may miss the chance to lead. To fend off regulation and antitrust enforcement, the internet platforms spend millions of dollars on lobbying in Washington. They align their self-interest with a nationalist pitch, warning that curbing America's homegrown tech companies would serve the interests of Chinese competitors like TikTok.
 Europe, however, doesn't have a stake in the dominance of American tech companies. Policymakers talk about the importance of maintaining the health of their democracies. ''We see how the money of advertisers for extreme speech is shifting from the traditional media to digital media,'' VÄ›ra JourovÃ¡, the vice president for values and transparency at the European Commission, told me this summer. ''Google and Facebook are the big suckers of this money.'' Among other things, JourovÃ¡ mentioned regulating the platforms' algorithms. ''These issues here are not driven by big money like they are in the U.S., or by regressive ideas as in a state like China,'' she said. Maduro of the European Digital Media Observatory has proposed treating the platforms like essential facilities, the European version of public utilities, and subjecting them to more regulation. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat, has outlined a similar idea in the U.S. It would be a huge shift.
 As we hurtle toward the November election with a president who has trapped the country in a web of lies, with the sole purpose, it seems, of remaining in office, it's time to ask whether the American way of protecting free speech is actually keeping us free. Hannah Arendt finished her classic work on totalitarianism in the early 1950s, after barely escaping Germany with her life, leaving friends and homeland behind. She was a Jewish intellectual who saw the Nazis rise to power by demonizing and blaming Jews and other groups with mockery and scorn. The ideal subject of fascist ideology was the person ''for whom the distinction between fact and fiction (i.e. the reality of experience),'' Arendt wrote, ''and the distinction between true and false (i.e. the standards of thought) no longer exist.'' An information war may seem to simply be about speech. But Arendt understood that what was at stake was far more.

WASHINGTON - Japan Today
George Floyd's younger brother took his grief to the U.S. Congress on Wednesday with an impassioned plea that lawmakers not let his brother's death be in vain, lamenting that he ""didn't deserve to die over $20"" in a what he called a lynching.
The House of Representatives Judiciary Committee held the first congressional hearing to examine racial injustice and police brutality following George Floyd's May 25 death after a Minneapolis policeman knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. His death prompted a wave of protests in U.S. cities and abroad.
""They lynched my brother. That was a modern-day lynching in broad daylight,"" Philonise Floyd, 42, of Missouri City, Texas, near Houston, told the committee, his voice breaking with emotion.
""His life mattered. All our lives matter. Black lives matter,"" he added, wiping away tears.
The Democratic-led House is moving forward with sweeping reform legislation that could come to a vote by July 4, while Senate Republicans are crafting a rival plan.
George Floyd, a 46-year-old Houston native who had worked security at nightclubs, was unarmed when taken into custody outside a market where an employee had reported that a man matching his description tried to pay for cigarettes with a counterfeit bill.
""George wasn't hurting anyone that day. He didn't deserve to die over $20. I'm asking you, is that what a black man's worth?$20? This is 2020. Enough is enough,"" his brother said. ""It is on you to make sure his death is not in vain.""
He buried his brother on Tuesday and described how they had not been able to say goodbye.
""I'm here to ask you to make it stop. Stop the pain,"" Philonise Floyd testified. ""George called for help and he was ignored. Please listen to the call I'm making to you now, to the calls of our family and the calls ringing on the streets of all the world.""
It is unclear whether Democrats and Republicans will be able to overcome partisan differences to pass legislation that President Donald Trump would be willing to sign.
Several Republicans pledged cooperation and voiced support for a pivotal provision that would scale back so-called qualified immunity protections that shield police from lawsuits by people suing for damages.
White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany, who said the Republican president may take policy action on race and policing through an executive order, called reduced qualified immunity a""non-starter."" McEnany said Trump's administration has nearly finalized plans to address police brutality that could be made public within days.
Police officer Derek Chauvin was fired after the incident and charged with second- and third-degree murder and manslaughter. George Floyd and Chauvin worked as security personnel at the same nightclub.
Philonise Floyd said Chauvin knew his brother and killed him with premeditation ""just because he didn't like him,"" adding that ""it has to have something to do with racism.""
The emotionally charged hearing had lawmakers and witnesses including several civil rights advocates expressing sorrow over Floyd's death, the latest in a series of killings of African-Americans by police that have sparked anger on America's streets and fresh calls for reforms.
The hearing highlighted divisions in Congress and the country between those who want broad changes to policing practices and those who defend the work of law enforcement and blame any problems on, as Republican Representative Mike Johnson put it, a ""few bad apples.""
""The vast, vast majority of law enforcement officers are responsible, hard-working, heroic first responders,"" added Representative Jim Jordan, the committee's top Republican.
""While we hold up human rights in the world, we obviously have to hold them up in our country,"" said Representative Karen Bass, chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, which crafted the legislation.
Angela Underwood Jacobs, a Republican witness whose police officer brother was slain during violent protests this month, urged lawmakers to promote a just society by investing in education, housing and job creation.
The Democratic legislation would ban police chokeholds and no-knock warrants, restrict the use of legal force, require police body cameras, make lynching a federal hate crime and take other steps to rein in misconduct.

133,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1251/Files (250).DOCX","The Johns Hopkins News-Letter: Johns Hopkins University",2020-12-12,"1016 words","OPINION; Pg. 1",NA,NA,"A judiciary changeup: Trump's Supreme Court is inconsistent on religious freedom",FALSE,"The predictability of judicial proceedings based on precedent is the cornerstone of our common law system. Unfortunately, the closer this predictability aligns with ideological beliefs held by judges, the farther we stray from the foundational values of our country. This disparity can clearly be seen when comparing rulings from the Supreme Court of the United States : two recent cases against New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and a case against U.S. President Donald Trump and his ""Muslim ban"" early in his presidency.
Throughout the pandemic, Cuomo has met with leaders and warned respective religious institutions about adherence to health department rules and regulations. In early October, COVID-19 case numbers rose in New York state, leading Cuomo to sign Executive Order 202.68, a strategy to fight micro-cluster outbreaks of the virus. Cuomo further defined regulations on how religious congregations and places of gatherings should handle themselves: ""In red zones, no more than 10 persons may attend each religious service, and in orange zones, attendance is capped at 25.""
Both Agudath Israel of America and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn brought cases against Cuomo to SCOTUS, seeking relief from his order under the pretense of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. They claim that though they ""complied with all public health guidance"" and held congregations ""without a single outbreak,"" Cuomo is attacking and placing greater burdens on religious institutions compared to secular organizations through his order.
These statements in their plea present the organizations as law-abiding. Yet their own websites and newsletters report outbreaks and deaths among congregants; ""Five people test positive for the Coronavirus in the Diocese of Brooklyn including Three Priests,"" ""..Death of a Beloved Pastor due to Coronavirus,"" ""Seven Coronavirus Cases Confirmed...,"" just to name a few headlines. The Diocese even took the initiative early in the pandemic to voluntarily shut down all churches in Brooklyn and Queens to ""prevent the ever-present possibility of the virus spreading.""
The plaintiffs challenged the notion that Cuomo could decide which institutions were to be considered ""essential"" and which weren't, as seen in Justice Gorsuch's concurring opinion for the majority: ""In his judgment laundry and liquor, travel and tools, are all 'essential' while traditional religious exercises are not. That is exactly the kind of discrimination the First Amendment forbids."" SCOTUS is conveniently equating the experience of a religious congregation to an individual's grocery run, without regard to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that places of worship pose heightened risk for COVID-19 transmission.
This should not be treated as a radical ""departure from the First Amendment"" due to the simple fact that COVID-19 does not discriminate between a religious congregation, college lecture hall or any other large gathering. In fact, a congregation at its core is a large gathering of people; it looks like Cuomo actually treated houses of worship more favorably compared to their secular counterparts. If subjected to the same restrictions as secular activities with a comparable degree of transmission risk, these religious institutions would have been blocked from congregating at all.
SCOTUS decided to present itself as the defender of religious freedom against a perceived attack by Cuomo. Yet it didn't feel as impassioned to fight for liberties when Trump's Executive Order 13769 and extension - also known as the so-called ""Muslim Ban"" - was reviewed back in 2018.
Under the guise of national security interests, the Trump administration barred entry of foreign nationals from predominantly Muslim countries. The order was brought before SCOTUS due to the blatant discrimination toward this swathe of immigrants as both violating non-discriminatory principles in immigration law ensured by the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Establishment Clause which prevents legislation from favoring religion over non-religion (sound familiar, Cuomo?) or one religion over another.
In the ""Muslim ban"" we see an actual radical departure from the First Amendment. SCOTUS was presented with mounting evidence of anti-Muslim sentiment and verbiage by the Trump campaign and Trump's own Department of Homeland Security failing to conclude that citizenship in one of these countries correlated to a terrorist threat to national security. The dissenting Justices declared the executive order ""plainly unconstitutional."" Ironically, the Justices who ruled against Cuomo's order sided with Trump back in 2018, stating they found that ""evidence of anti-Muslim discrimination is unpersuasive.""
In the case against Trump, the court batted in his defense in spite of the baselessness of his order and the religious infringements present in the case. The Trump order's implementation following SCOTUS's concurrence resulted in the lowest refugee resettlement program admissions ever reported; fewer visa waivers being granted through the Visa Waiver Program, which endorses business or tourist stays for foreign nationals; and rising hate crimes motivated by religious animus or racial bias.
Despite public health guidance and scientific evidence, Cuomo's order was treated differently. SCOTUS merely advocated for looser regulations, which happened anyway as the red-zone affected areas naturally saw decreases in cases due to the efficacy of his order, but the long-term implications (specifically case numbers) remain unclear.
What is clear, however, is that the Trump appointees of SCOTUS will remain even after the fall of his administration, making SCOTUS fundamentally different - a changeup pitcher on the mound, the beginning of a new, perhaps more grim era. In Cuomo's own words, ""This was really just an opportunity for the court to express its philosophy and politics.""

With a hotly contested election underway in a polarized society, many people are concerned about violence from far-right extremists. But they may not understand the real threat. 
The law enforcement community is among those who have failed to understand the true nature and danger of far-right extremists. Over several decades, the FBI and other federal authorities have only intermittently paid attention to far-right extremists. In recent years, they have again acknowledged the extent of the threat. But it's not clear how long their attention will last.
While researching my forthcoming book, ""It Can Happen Here: White Power and the Rising Threat of Genocide in the U.S.,"" I discovered that there are five key mistakes people make when thinking about far-right extremists. These mistakes obscure the extremists' true danger.
1. Some have white supremacist views, but others don't
When asked to condemn white supremacists and extremists at the first presidential debate, President Donald Trump floundered, then said, ""Give me a name."" His Democratic challenger Joe Biden offered, ""The Proud Boys.""
Not all far-right extremists are militant white supremacists.
White supremacy, the belief in white racial superiority and dominance, is a major theme of many far-right believers. Some, like the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis, are extremely hardcore hate groups.
Others, who at times identify themselves with the term ""alt-right,"" often mix racism, anti-Semitism and claims of white victimization in a less militant way. In addition, there are what some experts have called the ""alt-lite,"" like the Proud Boys, who are less violent and disavow overt white supremacy even as they promote white power by glorifying white civilization and demonizing nonwhite people including Muslims and many immigrants.
There is another major category of far-right extremists who focus more on opposing the government than they do on racial differences. This so-called ""patriot movement"" includes tax protesters and militias, many heavily armed and a portion from military and law enforcement backgrounds. Some, like the Hawaiian-shirt-wearing Boogaloos, seek civil war to overthrow what they regard as a corrupt political order. 
2. They live in cities and towns across the nation and even the globe
Far-right extremists are in communities all across America.
The KKK, often thought of as centered in the South, has chapters from coast to coast. The same is true of other far-right extremist groups, as illustrated by the Southern Poverty Law Center's Hate Map.
Far-right extremism is also global, a point underscored by the 2011 massacre in Norway and the 2019 New Zealand mosque attack, both of which were perpetrated by people claiming to resist ""white genocide."" The worldwide spread led the U.N. to recently issue a global alert about the ""growing and increasing transnational threat"" of right-wing extremism.
3. Many are well-organized, educated and social-media savvy
Far-right extremists include people who write books, wear sport coats and have advanced degrees. For instance, in 1978 a physics professor turned neo-Nazi wrote a book that has been called the ""bible of the racist right."" Other leaders of the movement have attended elite universities.
Far-right extremists were early users of the internet and now thrive on social media platforms, which they use to agitate, recruit and organize. The 2017 ""Unite the Right"" rally in Charlottesville revealed how effectively they could reach large groups and mobilize them into action.
Platforms like Facebook and Twitter have recently attempted to ban many of them. But the alleged Michigan kidnappers' ability to evade restrictions by simply creating new pages and groups has limited the companies' success.
4. They were here long before Trump and will remain here long after
Many people associate far-right extremism with the rise of Trump. It's true that hate crimes, anti-Semitism and the number of hate groups have risen sharply since his campaign began in 2015. And the QAnon movement - called both a ""collective delusion"" and a ""virtual cult"" - has gained widespread attention.
But far-right extremists were here long before Trump.
The history of white power extremism dates back to slave patrols and the post-Civil War rise of the KKK. In the 1920s, the KKK had millions of members. The following decade saw the rise of Nazi sympathizers, including 15,000 uniformed ""Silver Shirts"" and a 20,000 person pro-Nazi rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City in 1939.
While adapting to the times, far-right extremism has continued into the present. It's not dependent on Trump, and will remain a threat regardless of his public prominence.
5. They pose a widespread and dire threat, with some seeking civil war
Far-right extremists often appear to strike in spectacular ""lone wolf"" attacks, like the Oklahoma City federal building bombing in 1995, the mass murder at a Charleston church in 2015 and the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting in 2018. But these people are not alone.
Most far-right extremists are part of larger extremist communities, communicating by social media and distributing posts and manifestos.
Their messages speak of fear that one day, whites may be outnumbered by nonwhites in the U.S., and the idea that there is a Jewish-led plot to destroy the white race. In response, they prepare for a war between whites and nonwhites.
[Deep knowledge, daily.Sign up for The Conversation's newsletter.]
Thinking of these extremists as loners risks missing the complexity of their networks, which brought as many as 13 alleged plotters together in the planning to kidnap Michigan's governor.
Together, these misconceptions about far-right extremist individuals and groups can lead Americans to underestimate the dire threat they pose to the public. Understanding them, by contrast, can help people and experts alike address the danger, as the election - and its aftermath - unfolds.

FULL TEXT
 September 2,2020, Wednesday Online Correction: 
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article misidentified the person who killed the journalist Ruben Salazar. He was a sheriff's deputy, not a police officer. 
CORRECTION APPENDED
The story about Latinos in America is an old one. And it isn't true. Created generations ago by whites to demonize Mexicans and then Puerto Ricans, the racist caricature of Latinos as a menacing foreign monolith persists, even as two-thirds of us were born here and we come from more than 20 different countries.
While we are everywhere in this country, from big cities to small towns, Latinos are largely missing from American media and culture, which makes us vulnerable. President Trump knows this and exploits these fictions for political gain.
Mr. Trump has accomplices. White gatekeepers in media, art and entertainment have long excluded or misrepresented Latinos, particularly Indigenous and Black Latinos, building the cultural scaffolding for the current administration. To defang these old falsehoods, we have to go after their enablers, transform media and cultural power structures and amplify and defend Latino storytellers. We must flex our power as a community.
Representative Joaquin Castro of Texas gave voice to this in a recent column for Variety: ""There is a dangerous nexus between the racist political rhetoric and the negative images of Latinos as criminals and invaders that Americans see on their screens."" Mr. Castro added, ""Hollywood needs to reckon with its systemic injustice and exclusion of our communities.""
Indeed, all media and culture industries must be held accountable, along with the advertisers, investors and funders who bankroll their behavior.
In Spanish, we say that ""la cultura cura"" - culture heals. But the U.S. culture industry, which creates seductive images that reverberate around the world, is a key culprit in Latino stereotyping. Latinos buy more movie tickets per capita than any other group, but of 1,200 top-grossing films from 2007 to 2018, Latinos made up only 3 percent of the lead or co-lead actors (and we are 19 percent of the population).
When we are onscreen, we're usually depicted in narrow ways. A 2019 Opportunity Agenda report found that 25 percent of Latino immigrant TV characters were portrayed as employed, while 88 percent were represented as incarcerated or the perpetrators of crime. Without alternative stories about regular shmegular Latinos, Mr. Trump's narratives sell to an audience primed by ""Narcos"" on Netflix.
White elites cannot muffle a huge, vibrant community for decades and not expect consequences. For Latinos in the Trump era, these consequences are deadly, from Hurricane Maria to the Walmart shooting in El Paso and the pandemic, as well as soaring hate crimes.
Latino artists and organizers are leading the way. In book publishing, 3 percent of employees in 2018 were Latino, a statistic that helps explain why the industry was surprised when Latinos were outraged by the stereotypes in the novel ""American Dirt."" The author-led Dignidad Literaria movement and Latinx in Publishing are organizing to demand that the industry tell Latino stories, and tell them well.
Protests by Chicano activists when Disney attempted to trademark the phrase ""Day of the Dead,"" played a major role in making the movie ""Coco"" the culturally astute blockbuster it became. Whether the goal is to shape the movie or shut it down, protests and boycotts coupled with strategic support for alternatives can work.
Plenty has been written about the toxicity of narco stereotypes, and industry insiders have been organizing against them too. Latinos can learn from Color of Change, which has investigated how TV crime shows misrepresent Black people and campaigned to shut them down, resulting in the demise of the program ""Cops.&#34; Never underestimate the power of bad publicity and people power.
The facts are as important as the fictions. In the mid-19th century, when white mobs were lynching Mexicans, Spanish-language media covered those murders, leading to public protest and eventual change. Latino journalists from Ruben Salazar (killed by a Los Angeles sheriff's deputy during the Chicano Moratorium 50 years ago) to Juan González, Roberto Lovato, Sonia Nazario, Maria Hinojosa and Tanzina Vega have played herculean roles, but their numbers are small, particularly when it comes to opinion writing.
This means that we don't set the national agenda, and that too many abuses of our community, from police brutality to wage theft, are never exposed. Organizing inside and outside the newsroom is the primary reason this country's mainstream media has begun to represent the people it covers, as documented in Juan González and Joe Torres's indispensable book ""News for All the People.""
If a U.S. media outlet today doesn't have several Latino writers, editors and columnists it should be embarrassed and it should be hiring; mastheads must be published and visible; the N.F.L'.s Rooney rule, which requires each football team to interview candidates of color from outside the organization when hiring for major jobs, should be instituted across the industry; bylines, articles, sources and salaries should be scrutinized. Just 13 percent of the Los Angeles Times newsroom is Latino in a city that is almost 50 percent Latino. As a result of organizing by the paper's union and its Latino caucus, the newspaper's owner committed to a 25 percent Latino staff in the next five years.
The inventory of exclusion is long. Latinos have been shut out of prestige magazines that confer authority, awards and book deals. New York City is about 30 percent Latino - 2.5 million stories to tell. Yet on its contributor page, The New Yorker magazine does not appear to list a single Latino; the magazine declined to confirm or deny. Because of the publication's union, some newsroom inequalities have recently been addressed. The New Yorker should tackle racial inequalities too, so that excluded groups, including Latinos, particularly nonwhite Latinos, are hired as high-level editors and writers and the magazine can credibly cover Nueva York.
Funders and investors working to build Latino power must understand that information is essential community infrastructure. They should invest in independent Latino journalism like Futuro Media Group, L.A. Taco, Revista Étnica, Conecta Arizona, 80grados, Radio Ambulante and Latino Rebels instead of bankrolling perennially ""diversifying"" but never ""diverse"" organizations.
The Mexican-American critic Shea Serrano's one-man media empire is a model. He created a scholarship to support emerging Latino journalists.
Spanish-language journalism must be supported, too: El Centro de Periodismo Investigativo in Puerto Rico played a pivotal role in bringing down Gov. Ricardo Roselló; imagine if we had an ace Latino investigative shop dissecting Washington. Cultural criticism, watchdog reporting and the opportunity to tell our own stories are crucial to building collective identity and confronting injustice.
Imagination is essential too. When you sleep with one eye open, it's difficult to dream. That's why our art is a survival strategy. It was on abundant display in Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA, a 2017 citywide series of exhibitions, funded by the Getty Foundation. Getty's support enabled La Raza newspaper and U.C.L.A.'s Chicano Studies Research Center to organize 25,000 images from its archive, offering an electrifying insider view of the 1970s Chicano power movement.
At the Los Angeles Central Library, the Oaxacan collective Tlacolulokos painted a glorious mural depicting contemporary Indigenous Zapotec culture, supplanting the library's mural from 1933, which showed Native Americans genuflecting to European colonialists. While there were problems with the Getty initiative - too often it shined a spotlight on white Latin American artists over brown and Black U.S. Latino artists - it was thrilling in its ambition and scale.
We need much more: Every major museum should commit to a similar initiative in the next three years, and museum boards and staffs, particularly curatorial teams, should look like the cities they operate in, or forfeit public and private funding.
Imagine if Hollywood took a cue from Pacific Standard Time: if it made a Oaxacan blockbuster based on the Tlacolulokos murals; an Afro-Dominican futurist fantasy; a drama about the Chicano power movement; a Guatemalan buddy comedy. What if one summer all the blockbusters featured Latino stars, saving cities, planets, people, aliens?
Pacific Standard Time brought Latino artists and arts organizations from the margins to the center of the Los Angeles art conversation, and demonstrated their dynamism. Let's be clear: Latinos have not been ignored because we are uninteresting.
But whether they have access to gallery walls or not, Latinos have figured out ways to make their art and find audiences. On Instagram, the riveting @Veteranas_and_Rucas celebrates Los Angeles Latinas with photographs and stories. Its creator, Guadalupe Rosales, has built a community of 257,000 by shining a light on women who are seldom celebrated outside their community.
Its popularity speaks to the pleasures of reveling in ourselves at a time when our flamboyance feels like a liability. Djali Brown-Cepeda's Nueva Yorkinos does something similar for Latino New Yorkers, telling stories of migration and longing. These foster community, disrupt the country's amnesia about Latinos and demonstrate our thirst to see ourselves. We need to support more self-representation, from podcasts to public art, that do the same.
All of these efforts are important. But the stories we tell once we have the microphone are critical. Around Latin America, the racial discourse is one of mixing Indigenous, African and European roots, but the most European-featured, light-skinned people usually end up on top, an issue that has resulted in criticism against Spanish-language channels like Univision and Telemundo by organizations like the grass-roots group Mijente.
The fact that many Latinos, particularly white and light-skinned Latinos, are resistant to talking about how white privilege operates in our own communities means that they silence Indigenous and Afro-Latinos, an internal erasure that reinforces the external one. We must dismantle white supremacy in English and en español, and ensure that Indigenous and Black Latinos are onscreen, behind the camera and running shows and newsrooms.
In order to reshape cultural power, Latinos must apply pressure from all angles. They should challenge advertisers, a tactic Presente.org and others used to get the anti-Latino Lou Dobbs off CNN. Shareholder activism is another option: by holding at least $2,000 in a public company's stock, one can submit a shareholder proposal expressing concerns about a company's practices for its investors to vote on.
This could mean investing in media and entertainment companies in order to challenge problematic practices or partnering with investor networks like the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility to shape their priorities around racial justice. For too long, Latinos have been shut out by the corporations that decide how we are portrayed; shareholder strategies have a record of making companies uncomfortable and setting off change. What if we weren't perceived as casualties of culture but as its owners?
Latinos have been fighting white supremacy since California was part of Mexico. In the past months, 21 percent of Hispanic voters said they had participated in Black Lives Matter protests, for example. From the days of Arturo Schomburg, the pioneering Black Puerto Rican scholar, to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Cesar Chavez's friendship, the Young Lords and the Black Panthers, Black and Latino communities have overlapped - according to one study, a quarter of Latinos identify as Afro-Latino - and worked together for justice (of course, there are also Latinos who support Mr. Trump). Today's protests are important, but we also have to deconstruct the cultural context that got us here.
We are the second-largest ethnic group in this country. Many of us were here before the ancestors of most people who call themselves Americans. Others came as casualties of U.S. colonial experiments, covert operations and trade deals.
No matter how we got here or when, this country should be grateful for the Latino community: During this pandemic, farmworkers, 80 percent of whom are Latino, have put food on the table for us all, and scores of other Latino workers have propped this country up, often at great cost to themselves.
The United States must reckon with the fact that Latinos are essential to its survival and to its splendor, and have been for generations. We Latinos need to know it, too.

137,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1251/Files (250).DOCX","Herald Sun Online",2020-06-23,"1874 words",NA,"Sarah Blake in New York, AP, Reuters",NA,"White House sends in National Guard to protect monuments",FALSE,"The Trump administration has activated the National Guard to protect monuments during anti-racism protests in Washington, according to a report.
Interior Secretary David Bernhardt requested the deployment this week, Fox News first reported, citing a senior US defence official.
The move follows the toppling on Friday of Washington DC's only statue of a Confederate leader, Albert Pike, near the city's police headquarters. On Monday, protesters unsuccessfully tried to topple a statue of President Andrew Jackson facing the White House, reports the New York Post.
Mr Trump called the assault on Jackson's statue, which was lassoed with ropes, a ""sneak attack"" and warned activists they face up to 10 years in prison under the Veterans' Memorial Preservation Act.
The number of people protesting against racism and police brutality in Washington has diminished since an initial wave of protests in late May and early June against the killing of George Floyd by Minnesota police.
But significant across the US protests continue, including an unsuccessful effort on Monday to establish a ""Black House Autonomous Zone,"" or BHAZ, outside the White House.
During initial protests over Floyd's death, large demonstrations near the White House gave way to widespread property damage and looting.
It's not immediately clear how many National Guard members will be deployed, or if the local DC National Guard will be aided by out-of-state guardsmen.
Out-of-state troops would be controversial. Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser this month demanded that out-of-state guardsmen invited by Mr Trump leave, and House Democrats will vote Friday on DC statehood to back local autonomy.
The Pentagon, the White House and the DC National Guard did not immediately offer comment.
During the initial wave of protests over Floyd's death, National Guard members bolstered Secret Service and Park Police ranks near the White House and guarded the Lincoln Memorial, Vietnam Veterans Memorial and other sites on the National Mall.
Any effort to guard federal statues in DC would be daunting. The National Park Service controls traffic circles and parks across Washington, many dedicated to men who owned slaves.
CONTROVERSIAL SOUTH CAROLINA STATUE REMOVED
Several hundred people have gathered in Marion Square, in the historic South Carolina city of Charleston, to watch the removal of a statue of former vice-president and slavery advocate John C. Calhoun. 
Officials voted unanimously to remove the statue from the downtown square, the latest in a wave of actions arising from protests against racism and police brutality against African-Americans.
Crews in bucket trucks soared more than 30-metres in the air to the top of the pedestal, where they strapped the statue around its shoulders in preparations for its removal using an even taller piece of equipment that appeared to have pulleys attached.
Council members approved the measure 13-0 at a late-day meeting. 
The resolution authorised the removal of the statue of the former US vice-president and senator from South Carolina.
City officials said eventually that the Calhoun statue will be placed permanently at ""an appropriate site where it will be protected and preserved. 
 It comes as Joe Biden scores a 14-point lead over Mr Trump ahead of the November election as some Republican-leaning voters reproach Mr Trump for his response to the coronavirus crisis, a poll showed on Wednesday.
In one of Mr Trump's worst poll showings for the 2020 race, Mr Biden garnered 50 per cent of the vote compared with 36 per cent for the president, according to a survey by the New York Times and Siena College.
CROWDS TEAR DOWN STATUES, STATE SENATOR 'ATTACKED'
It comes as crowds outside the Wisconsin State Capitol tore down two statues, attacked a state senator, threw a molotov cocktail into a government building and unsuccessfully tried to break into the Capitol building amid protests following the arrest of a black man who shouted at restaurant customers through a megaphone while carrying a baseball bat.
Police officers inside the Capitol used pepper spray against protesters who were trying to gain entry into the historic centre of state government, successfully repelling them, Madison police said.
Governor Tony Evers on Wednesday (local time) said he was prepared to activate the Wisconsin National Guard to protect state properties in the wake of the violence. 
""What happened in Madison last night presented a stark contrast from the peaceful protests we have seen across our state in recent weeks, including significant damage to state property,"" Gov. Evers said in a statement. 
The violence in Madison on Tuesday started after Madison police arrested a protester who came to a restaurant across the street from the Capitol talking through a megaphone with a baseball bat on his shoulder. 
Video released by Madison police shows the man talking through the megaphone while walking around the restaurant's outdoor patio. 
He goes inside and paces through the restaurant with the bat on his shoulder, saying he's ""disturbing"" the restaurant and talking about God and the police before walking out.
Protesters chanting for the release of the man who had been arrested also broke glass at the Tommy Thompson Centre, named after the state's former Republican governor, and smashed windows and lights at the state Capitol. 
Early on Wednesday (local time), police in riot gear worked to clear a crowd of about 100 people that remained in the area.
One of the statues that was toppled, decapitated and dragged into a lake about 1km away was of Civil War Colonel Hans Christian Heg. 
He was an antislavery activist and leader of an anti-slave catcher militia in Wisconsin who fought for the Union and died from injuries suffered during the Battle of Chickamauga. 
The other statue taken down from its pedestal and dragged in the street outside the Capitol represents Wisconsin's motto of ""Forward."" The statue had been previously vandalised in past protests with paint thrown on it and graffiti spray painted on and around it.
""Forward"" was first installed 125 years ago, but replaced with a bronze replica in 1998. It is placed prominently outside the Capitol, facing the University of Wisconsin campus and the street lined with bars, restaurants and small businesses. That corridor has been the target of much of the vandalism since the death of George Floyd, who died on May 25 in Minneapolis after a white police officer used his knee to pin down the handcuffed Black man's neck even after Floyd stopped moving.
The destruction followed similar unrest nationwide following Floyd's death, but in other cities statues of Confederate soldiers and other symbols of slavery were destroyed.
Late on Tuesday in Madison, Democratic state Senator Tim Carpenter was assaulted after taking a mobile phone video of protesters. 
Sen. Carpenter posted video he was recording before being assaulted.
""Punched/kicked in the head, neck, ribs,"" Sen. Carpenter tweeted around 4am (7pm AEST). 
""Maybe concussion, socked in left eye is little blurry, sore neck & ribs. 8-10 people attacked me. Innocent people are going to get killed. Capitol locked - stuck in office. Stop violence nowPlz!"" 
BUBBA WALLACE 'P***ED"" AT INTEGRITY QUESTIONS NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace says he's ""p***ed"" people are questioning his integrity after the FBI said a noose found in his garage stall was there before his team moved in.
""I'm mad because people are trying to test my character and the person that I am and my integrity,"" he told CNN in the US.
NASCAR said it launched an investigation after a crew member discovered the noose last weekend at the Talladega Superspeedway. 
In a statement earlier this week, NASCAR said it was ""angry and outraged"" and called in the FBI to investigate.
Federal authorities then ruled the rope had been hanging there since at least last October and was not a hate crime.
US lawyer Jay Town and FBI Special Agent in Charge Johnnie Sharp Jr. said the investigation determined ""nobody could have known Mr Wallace would be assigned"" to that same stall. NASCAR said it was the lone garage stall with a pull down rope that resembled a noose.
NASCAR has defended its reaction and insisted it would call the FBI again. A defiant Mr Wallace said there is no confusion and the rope had been fashioned into a noose.
""I wanted to make sure this wasn't just a knot,"" Mr Wallace said on CNN. ""It was a noose. Whether it was tied in 2019 ... it is a noose.""
PROTESTERS AT ARMED SHOOTING SITE WON'T 'ALLOW' COPS
Armed protesters near the Atlanta site where Rayshard Brooks was fatally shot during his arrest earlier this month say police are no longer allowed in the area - which residents say is getting increasingly dangerous, according to new reports.
One man, joined by two others on Tuesday night (local time) near the Wendy's restaurant in Atlanta where the June 12 shooting occurred, told FOX News that he was carrying a 12-gauge shotgun.
""It's for me and the rest of our peaceful people, to protect us and also me, because as you guys know, there is no police presence here,"" said the man. 
""There's no one else to protect us, so me and my fellow brothers are here to protect each other.""
MORE NEWS 
""The police aren't allowed here because they aren't here to protect us,"" he added. ""They're not here to serve and protect anymore.""
If a patrol car does roll up to the site, according to one of the other men, ""he's going to have to leave.""
A third man said protesters will ""calmly discuss and converse"" with the officers, telling them they aren't moving and they are peaceful.
A Fox News reporter observed a roadblock with no police in sight.
The Atlanta Police Department told Fox News early on Wednesday (local time) that the department ""is monitoring the situation and plans to co-ordinate with community leaders and the Wendy's property owner to address security issues and help preserve peace for this community as soon as possible.""
Police arrested Natalie White, 29, accused of torching the Wendy's where Brooks was gunned down by police.
White was granted bond on Wednesday but must wear an ankle monitor and remain at home. She appeared in court by video from the Fulton County jail, where she has been held on a first-degree arson charge since she turned herself in on Tuesday. 
The arrest warrant accuses her of setting fire to the Wendy's restaurant using a torch made with a lighter and some type of can.
Before he was shot, Brooks told officers three times that he had been with a girlfriend named Natalie White that night. 
White's lawyer confirmed that his client is the person Brooks was talking about but has declined to comment further on their relationship, saying only that they were close.
Brooks, 27, was fatally shot by an Atlanta police officer during a foot chase with police in the restaurant's parking lot. After he failed a sobriety test, he took off running with an officer's Taser.
As Brooks fled, he turned back and pointed the Taser at officer Garrett Rolfe, who then opened fire.
Rolfe, 27, was fired from the department and charged with murder. The second responding officer, Devin Brosnan, 26, was placed on administrative duty and charged with aggravated assault in connection with the death.

PAMELA BROWN, CNN HOST: Thank you so much Nick Valencia. I'm Pamela Brown in for Jake Tapper. Follow me on Twitter @PamelaBrownCNN or tweet the show @TheLeadCNN. Our coverage on CNN continues right now.
WOLF BLITZER, CNN HOST: Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer in THE SITUATION ROOM and we're following breaking news.
A very grim new milestone in the coronavirus pandemic which has now claimed more than 130,000 American lives over the past four months alone. And as the number of known cases in the country nears 3 million, the virus is clearly surging in 32 states.
But despite leading the world in cases and deaths, the White House is claiming the U.S. is seen as the global leader in fighting the pandemic. And it's also defending President Trump's unfounded claim that 99 percent of COVID cases are ""totally harmless.""
And more disturbing developments, the White House also refusing to denounce the Confederate flag while Mr. Trump stokes racial divide. He took a direct swipe at NASCAR's only top tier African-American driver, Bubba Wallace, and claimed NASCAR's decision to ban the Confederate flag has caused its lowest ratings ever. Not true.
Let's begin with the breaking news pandemic coverage. CNN's Nick Watt is joining us from Los Angeles right now. Nick, California, one of 32 states where the numbers clearly are climbing.
NICK WATT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, California is one of many places in this country where we have seen the case counts climb. We have seen the number of people in the hospital climb to record levels. And we are now just hoping that the death toll does not catch up.
The governor of California just said he is modestly optimistic that it won't because among the new infections, a lot of young people who are less susceptible.
But listen, as Dr. Anthony Fauci just said this morning, we are still knee-deep in the first wave of this and we need to deal with this situation immediately. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
WATT (voice-over): On Independence Day, Florida suffered more new cases than any state has ever. Still, the governor seems sanguine.
RON DESANTIS (R), GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA: I mean, there's no need to really be fearful about it.
WATT (voice-over): But some mayors are.
FRANCIS SUAREZ (R), MAYOR OF MIAMI: What happened is, what's happened across the country, which is, you know, when we opened, you know, people began to socialize as if the coronavirus didn't exist.
WATT (voice-over): Miami-Dade just closed dine-in restaurants again.
DAN GELBER (D), MAYOR OF MIAMI BEACH, FLORIDA: We're starting to roll the carpet back up. You know, it's pretty clear we have this real problem.
WATT (voice-over): Because a staggering 26 percent of all COVID-19 tests in the county came back positive on Sunday.
AMY COMPTON-PHILLIPS, CHIEF CLINICAL OFFICER, PROVIDENCE HEALTH SYSTEM: That means we're not capturing the virus very well. We're not putting a ring around all those infections and keeping them contained. And, instead, it is exploding beyond those boundaries.
WATT (voice-over): CNN contacted 27 people who tested positive in Florida. Only five said they were called by a contact tracer.
PETER HOTEZ, DO-DIRECOTR, TEXAS CHILDREN HOSPITAL FOR VACCINE DEVELOPMENT: We call them spikes but I call this massive resurgence. We're in free fall and nothing (ph) can stop it.
WATT (voice-over): In Texas, the number of patients in the hospital is hitting a new record high every day.
RON NIRENBERG (I), MAYOR OF SAN ANTONIO: If the pace continues, we're a week away from running out of hospital beds and ICU capacity.
WATT (voice-over): Now, remember those Memorial Day crowds back in May? Well, three weeks later, new case counts climbed nationally. And 32 states are now going in the wrong direction. Did we learn a lesson? Well, this was Backwater Jack's in the Ozarks Memorial Day weekend and July 4th. Almost indistinguishable.
There were crowds across the country this past weekend. Too many drawn to water. And a house party in L.A. and a peach party on Fire Island. So many celebrating shaking off the Brits, but not this virus. Not even close.
SCOTT GOTTLIEB, FORMER FDA COMMISSIONER: We're right back where we were at the peak of the epidemic during the New York outbreak.
WATT (voice-over): And remember what New York looked like in April. Crowded hospitals, morgue trucks outside. Today, though, a different story.
ANDREW CUOMO (D), GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK: The numbers have actually declined since we started re-opening.
WATT (voice-over): Apparently it's simple. New York was the first state to mandate masks for all and, for example, decided not to open indoor restaurants in the city today.
CUOMO: Keep your hand on the valve. As you see it start to go up, slow down the valve. If you don't see the numbers going up, then you can open up the economic activity valve. And that's what we've been doing.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
[17:04:55]
WATT (on camera): And on schools, the governor of New York again this morning said we haven't made a decision yet despite the mayor of New York City last week saying kids will be back in September. We're actually expecting some guidelines on the re-opening of schools from the CDC possibly sometime this week.
BLITZER: All right, Nick, thank you very much. Nick Watt reporting for us. Let's go to the White House right now. Our White House correspondent Kaitlan Collins is joining us. Kaitlan, the president and his team seem to have an alternate reality when it comes to the pandemic. Hundreds of Americans are continuing to die every single day.
KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, that's certainly the president has had to be really disinterested in the response to the pandemic. As Nick noted, we are seeing these outbreaks and new cases and what's happening across the United States as some state are scaling back their re-openings.
But Wolf, on several fronts today, the White House is having to defend comments the president made in recent days starting with a claim about coronavirus cases in the United States.
Here at the White House on Saturday night to a tweet this morning where he seemed to criticize NASCAR for banning the Confederate flag from its events.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
COLLINS (voice-over): With infections surging across the country, White House officials spent the day insisting President Trump isn't downplaying the severity of the coronavirus pandemic.
MARK MEADOWS, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: I don't even know that is a generalization. When you start to look at the stats and look at all the numbers that we have, the amount of testing that we have, the vast majority of people are safe from this.
KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The president isn't downplaying the severity of the virus. COLLINS (voice-over): The chief of staff and press secretary argued instead that President Trump was referencing the fatality rate when he wrongly made this claim Saturday night, that 99 percent of coronavirus cases are totally harmless.
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Now, we have tested almost 40 million people. By so doing, we show cases 99 percent of which are totally harmless. Results that no other country can show because no other country has testing that we have.
COLLINS (voice-over): The FDA commissioner refused to back up or correct what the president said despite being pressed multiple times.
DANA BASH, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Is the president wrong?
STEPHEN HAHN, FDA COMMISSIONER: So, I'm not going to get into who's right and who's wrong. What I'm going to say, Dana, is what I've said before which is that it's a serious problem that we have.
COLLINS (voice-over): New York Governor Andrew Cuomo accused Trump of enabling the virus.
CUOMO: He makes up facts. He makes up science. He is facilitating the virus. He is enabling the virus by statements like that.
COLLINS (voice-over): Despite continuing to dismiss the record number of new cases, the pandemic got closer to Trump's inner circle this weekend.
KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, TRUMP CAMPAIGN OFFICIAL: Let's welcome Donald Trump, Jr.!
COLLINS (voice-over): Kimberly Guilfoyle, a top fund raising official and his son, Donald Trump, Jr.'s girlfriend tested positive for coronavirus ahead of his speech in Mount Rushmore.
When the White House was asked why the South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem was allowed to fly on Air Force One after being seen hugging Guifoyle, McEnany punted to Secret Service which does not decide who flies on Air Force one.
MCENANY: Yes, I'd have to refer you to Secret Service on that.
COLLINS (voice-over): During her briefing, the press secretary also struggled to answer questions about Trump's tweet calling on NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace to apologize and wrongly claiming that NASCAR's ratings are down after the sport banned the Confederate flag. McEnany could not explain why Wallace needed to apologize for an investigation he didn't initiate into a rope he didn't find that the FBI later described as a noose.
MCENANY: In aggregates, what he was pointing out is this rush to judgment to immediately say that there is a hate crime as happened in this case.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He saying he needs to apologize. That's what we're trying to ask you, Kayleigh, is why should he have to apologize about that?
MCENANY: I'm not going to answer a question a sixth time.
COLLINS (voice-over): McEnany refused to say if Trump agreed with NASCAR's decision to ban the Confederate flag and instead insisted that he had no opinion on it at all.
MCENANY: He said he was not making a judgment one way or the other. The intention of the tweet was to stand up for the men and women of NASCAR.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Does he think it was a mistake for NASCAR to ban it?
MCENANY: The president said he wasn't making a judgment one way or the other. You're focusing on one word at the very bottom of a tweet.
COLLINS (voice-over): In his response, Wallace said ""always deal with hate being thrown at you with love, even when it's hate from the president of the United States.""
(END VIDEOTAPE)
COLLINS (on camera): Now, Wolf, the press secretary said Trump isn't making a judgment on the Confederate flag, but the military could soon. A defense official is telling my colleague, Barbara Starr, that there is a draft policy document circulating among the highest levels at the Pentagon right now that would ban the Confederate flag from all military bases.
Now, Wolf, it hasn't been approved. It's still undergoing a legal review, but if it is, it could pit these senior military leaders against the president.
[17:10:00]
BLITZER: Very, very interesting indeed. All right, Kaitlan Collins at the White House. Thanks very much.
There's more breaking news. Only moments ago, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency or ICE as its known, announced that thousands -- thousands of foreign students here in the United States will be forced to leave the country or risk deportation if their universities switch to online-only classes in the fall.
We're going to get more on this development. That's coming up as well. In the meantime, let's discuss all the coronavirus pandemic developments with Dr. Boris Lushniak, the former acting Surgeon General and dean of the University Of Maryland School Of Public Health. And Jeffrey Shaman, and epidemiologist at Columbia University. Thanks to both of you for joining us.
Dr. Shaman, today the death toll here in the U.S. passed 130,000 -- 130,000 Americans have died over the past four months. The country also hit record numbers of new cases going into this past holiday weekend. If we continue on this trend here in the United States, what's your assessment, how bad could things get?
JEFFREY SHAMAN, EPIDEMIOLOGIST, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY: Well, look, it's an unspeakable tragedy to have 130,000 plus people die already from this disease, which could have been mitigated and slowed through better preventive measures.
Unfortunately, we have not completed our journey with the virus at all. There are many people who haven't been exposed and there's a consequence, if we don't get our act together better collectively, if we don't bring this to heel, if we don't act more forcefully against the virus, it will continue to kill people.
It will infect many more people and it will kill people along the way. There are many people who have not yet been infected. And, as a consequence of that, it could continue and it could start up and flare up in places where it already has occurred and in the places that are currently really dealing with it in a hard way we are not yet done with it unless we really take active control measures.
BLITZER: You know, Dr. Lushniak, the White House press secretary today defended the president's claim that 99 percent of coronavirus cases here in the U.S., the president's words, are totally harmless. She said he was referring to the low mortality rate here, but it wasn't harmless for 130,000 Americans died.
And we know many people have long-term complications from this virus. Is there any truth to the president's claim, 99 percent totally harmless? Is there any truth to the president's claim at all?
BORIS LUSHNIAK, FORMER ACTING SURGEON GENERAL: Wolf, you know, the messaging from the White House is getting more and more ridiculous and more and more dangerous as time goes on. We need to acknowledge that this novel virus is in fact sickening individuals and is killing individuals in the United States.
Yes, some people are asymptomatic. Yes, some people have mild cases of this disease. But, in essence, we also are having a lot of people who are being hospitalized. Look at the ICUs in Texas as they are filling up right now, right. These are not harmless cases. This is not a harmless pandemic. And we need to be strong enough to begin correcting the president of the United States.
BLITZER: And it's clearly important to note that even if a young person is asymptomatic, he is not harmless or she is not harmless because that person, Dr. Shaman, could easily pass on the virus to moms and dads and grandparents and others and potentially they could die. That is not harmless.
SHAMAN: It's not harmless and that's the real issue here. This is not just about protecting each individual's health. It's not just somebody saying that I'm 25 years old, I'm healthy. I can go out, I'll get the virus. It's not going to affect me.
You are still capable of transmitting it onto other individuals. You are capable of making other people in your vicinity, in your connective circle sick, many of whom may have comorbidities and chronic conditions that put them severely at risk.
This is the messaging we need. We need to manage people's expectations to understand that we're going to be dealing with this virus for some time and we have to wear face masks and enact social distancing and wash our hands and restrict our activities because it's just not about protecting ourselves. It's about protecting each other.
BLITZER: You know, Dr. Lushniak, the White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany also claimed the world sees the U.S. right now as a leader in fighting this virus. When you heard that, what was your reaction to that?
LUSHNIAK: You know, far from it. You know, it's no small wonder that the European Union is not allowing Americans to travel to Europe right now. That is not a world leader in this. This is a country right now where we are having a major issue with increasing numbers of cases of COVID-19 throughout the United States.
And, you know, we really have a lot of catching up to do, a lot of work to do. And it really begins at the leadership level, right. Leadership needs to acknowledge this pandemic has gone awry. Leadership has to acknowledge this is a dangerous time.
[17:15:58]
Leadership has to acknowledge that we have health inequities built into our system. We have to get much more active in terms of our response.
BLITZER: Yeah, more than 130,000 Americans over the past four months alone have died from coronavirus. Hundreds are dying every single day with no end in sight right now. Doctors Lushniak and Shaman, to both of you, thank you very much as usual for joining us.
Up next, we're going to have more on the White House refusal to condemn the Confederate flag. Does the president see racism as a path toward re-election?
Plus, Florida facing record numbers of rising coronavirus cases. I'll speak to the mayor of Miami-Dade County where tough new restrictions have just been announced.
[17:20:00]
BLITZER: This afternoon, faced with new salvos of divisive tweets and rhetoric from President Trump, the White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany went to truly extraordinary lengths to defend the president.
She refused to denounce the Confederate flag even though just days ago, Mississippi removed the Confederate battle symbol from its state flag. Listen to this exchange. Listen to this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Does he think NASCAR made a mistake by banning the Confederate flag?
MCENANY: So, he said, I spoke to him this morning about this and he said he was not making a judgment one way or the other.
The president said he wasn't making a judgment one way or the other. You're focusing on one word at the very bottom of a tweet that's completely taken out of context and neglecting the complete rush to judgment on this.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why is the president so supportive of flying the Confederate flag?
MCENANY: So, I think you're referring to a tweet this morning. Is that right?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Correct.
MCENANY: So, I think you're mischaracterizing the tweet. The president never said that. Again, you're taking his tweet completely out of context.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The president said that NASCAR saw bad ratings because they took down the Confederate flag, banned the Confederate flag. Does he believe NASCAR should fly the flag? And why don't they fly it here?
MCENANY: The whole point of the tweet was to note the incident, the alleged hate crime that in fact was not a hate crime at the very end. The ban on the flag was mentioned in a broader context.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why can't this White House unambiguously state whether or not it supports displays of the Confederate flag --
MCENANY: No, I said that --
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- and Confederate monuments, which are more a part of this question than Gandhi (ph).
MCENANY: Yes, I said that, you know, he was -- his tweet was not to indicate approval or disapproval of that particular policy of NASCAR. It was an aggregate to stand against the rush to judgment, to call something a hate crime before the facts were out when clearly the media was wrong about this.
The president has made clear he was not taking a position one way or the other in that tweet.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BLITZER: All right, let's bring in our political experts, Dana Bash, David Axelrod along with the NAACP president and CEO Derrick Johnson. Derrick, what do you make of the spin on the president's overtures, which a lot of people are describing as racist overtures to his base? DERRICK JOHNSON, PRESIDENT AND CEO, NAACP: Well, he is seeking to get reelected by increasing the base that no longer exist. I was a plan of a 1993 in Mississippi to take down the flag. We're talking about 27 years ago.
When the Mississippi speaker of the house, when the Mississippi lieutenant governor both can speak out against the flag and remove the flag just last week. These are staunch Republicans. This president should be able to find his way and do the same.
I personally believe this is a distraction, a distraction from the fact that he cannot keep the public safe because of the result of coronavirus. This is a distraction because Russia has had a contract on our military officers in a foreign land and he cannot keep them safe.
He is doing what he's always done. He distracts from the main point. But the Confederacy was an act of treason and no president of the United States should be supporting directly or indirectly acts of treason.
BLITZER: You know, Dana, what does it tell you that Kayleigh McEnany can't even say whether or not the president supports or condemns the Confederate flag?
BASH: Because no matter what she says, it's very possible. I would even say probable that the president will contradict her. I mean, you remember she said that he was just kidding about the fact that when he said in his rally in Tulsa that -- when he was talking about testing. And, you know what, slowing testing.
And you know what, the next day he said I don't kid. So, it's almost kind of like what's the point? You know, she was grasping at the thinnest and the furthest of straws she could find. But there is no good answer for what he did. Politically, morally, policy-wise, you know, you name it.
Because even politically you could even -- if you go down the road of what we just heard that he is trying to get to his base, he's got his base. And I was talking to Trump allies this afternoon after that tweet who are pulling their hair out. They are so frustrated because this is -- its classic Trump, that when he feels threatened in the words of one source, he just retreats to where -- what he used in 2016, what got him to where he is now.
But that's not what he needs now. He needs the politics of addition, not status quo or even subtraction, that is not me speaking, that's a source who wants him to win but very frustrated.
BLITZER: You know, David, do you believe the president sees racism as a potential path to re-election?
DAVID AXELROD, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Look, there's no doubt that -- and I've said this before, this president, his political calculus is all about division, not addition. He thinks that if you hit these themes that you can rally your base, and he views the world as binary with very little swing.
He thinks that this is a battle between two bases and if he just motivates his, that he can win the election. If he looks at polling, what he should see is that he's driven away many groups that were with him in 2016.
[17:25:03]
Including and most notably suburban voters who voted for him in 2016, are now 22 points on the average in these polls against him. But seniors, independent voters, college-educated white voters. And he is losing some ground even among non-college women voters.
So, you know, if this is his strategy, and I think part of it is deflection from his failures on COVID, wants to change the subject, his strategy is to start a dumpster fire over here to ignore that one over there or deflect from that one over there.
But this is not a winning strategy for him. And if I could just make one more point, Wolf, when Kayleigh said, well, he wasn't taking a side, what the president said in that tweet was that NASCAR, by taking the flag down, has its lowest ratings ever.
And anyone who knows the president knows that is like the worst thing he can say about someone, is that they have bad ratings. So, of course he was making a judgment.
BASH: Can I just add one thing, Wolf, if I may? We're talking right now about the Confederate flag part of the tweet, but there's something else that's really important. He went after an African- American NASCAR driver personally with a bold-faced lie, with a lie saying that he should apologize for this ""hoax.""
He was the victim. He was presented with the notion that there was a noose in his stall by the head of NASCAR. He didn't do anything wrong except receive this information. And the fact that he picked on this driver is very telling and very unfortunate.
BLITZER: Yeah. It certainly is. And, Derrick, let me read that tweet because it really is very, very awful. ""Has Bubba Wallace apologized to all of those great NASCAR drivers and officials who came to his aid, stood by his side and were willing to sacrifice everything for him only to find out that the whole thing was just another hoax? That and flag decision has caused lowest ratings ever.""
You can see the all caps for hoax and ever. You know, I think it's fair to say that Bubba Wallace, derrick, has absolutely nothing to apologize for. What he did was absolutely perfect in this area. And the president is just going after him for whatever reason.
JOHNSON: Again, I think this is a distraction from the fact that the numbers of infection from COVID keeps going up. All of his predictions has proven to be wrong. There is no federal plan to address this national pandemic, even in the southern states that was aligning with him, they are now backtracking in Texas and in Florida and in Georgia because the numbers are going up. Our medical facilities are becoming overwhelmed. He lacked any response. And now as he's done over the last three and a half years, he created a distraction away from the core of the issue where people are really concerned about their health.
This administration lacked any plan to address the health pandemic his constituents are now faced with in Georgia, in Florida, in Texas and across the south.
BLITZER: Do you think, Derrick, his comments, his tweets, his remarks are racist?
JOHNSON: Oh, absolutely. I've said it in year one, he is a racist. He is a racist based on his statements. He is a racist based on his actions. He is a racist based on his affiliations. Steve Miller is in the White House still.
We have a problem with this administration. Racism has germinated from this White House for the last three and a half years. And for many of us, we cannot wait to November, allow us to make the corrective course necessary for this nation to look forward and stop looking backwards.
BLITZER: All right, Derrick, thanks very much. Dana, thanks to you. David, appreciate it always.
Coming up, we are going to focus in on the surge of coronavirus cases. In Florida where more than 200,000 people have now been infected. And I'll speak with the mayor of Miami-Dade County. He's just ordered restaurants and gyms to close once again.
[17:34:16]
BLITZER: With coronavirus cases surging in Florida right now, the Mayor of Miami-Dade County is expected to issue an emergency order that will roll back at least some business reopening some, perhaps, including in-person dining at restaurants. Mayor Carlos Gimenez is joining us right now. Mayor, thank you so much for joining us. Can you give us a preview of what you're expected to do in the coming hours?
MAYOR CARLOS GIMENEZ (R), MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA: We're going to be closing some of the businesses that open sometime around the beginning of June because we saw a huge spike and in young cases and in young people becoming positive or on June 14th. So we went back a couple of weeks and around May 31st, we issued orders to allow the gyms et cetera, those kind of facilities to open up.
[17:35:02]
We also took away some restrictions on the operating hours of restaurants at the same time. And around the same time obviously we have some protests here. And so all of those things kind of put together, kind of lead us to believe that young people especially, we need to curtail the social activities of young people, because that's where our problems started with young people and then transmitting it to their parents and their grandparents to, where now, we've had a doubling of people in the hospital with COVID-19. We have a doubling of people in ICU and a doubling of people in ventilators.
And my concern is that we're going to reach the capacity or medical capacity here in Miami-Dade. That's something I do not want to get to.
BLITZER: Yes. I mean, it's so, so worrisome. In fact, we did some checking, Mayor, in the past two weeks, as you know better than anyone hospitalizations in your county have increased by 88 percent. The number of ICU beds are being used increased by 114 percent. So I'm wondering why you waited until after the busy holiday weekend to roll back some of these reopenings.
GIMENEZ: No, no, what I did -- well, one of the first thing I did, I mean, before the holiday weekend, we instituted a curfew again, that's in order to curtail some of this social activity that we've been seeing, you know, around town. Young people getting together, either using restaurants as quasi-bars after hours or actually getting together in homes, and maybe banquet halls and all that. So banquet halls, all those things are going to be closed before the holiday season.
Also, I haul it -- you know, the last holiday weekend, closed all the beaches because we felt that it was going to be a surge there. And we also closed a lot of casinos and -- casinos, movies, theaters, bowling alleys, all those things that were closed before the weekend. This is the next step going into trying to tamp down the rate of infection here in Miami-Dade County.
BLITZER: Yes. And people don't necessarily realize or appreciate that over the weekend, Florida reported more cases in a single day than New York did at its peak back in April. I guess I'm wondering why the Governor DeSantis continues to say this is simply the result of doing more testing. Is he wrong?
GIMENEZ: No. Well, look, the more testing you do, the more people you're going to see is going to come off positive because we did a medical study here in Miami-Dade two months ago, that we knew over 200,000 people had already tested positive.
If we took the positive rate that we put that out, 200,000 people would test the positive to the antibody. So the official number that you see, especially in Miami-Dade, we have about 40,000, we know it's way under counted. It's probably by a factor of 10. And I expect the same thing in the state of Florida.
So the more testing you do, the more people you're going to find the habit. Our problem isn't so much the number as it is the percentage. And so we were testing at about an 8 percent positive rate of the numbers of the tests that were being conducted. Now we're over 20 percent. That's the real issue.
And then when you correlate that with the increase in the hospitalizations, then you know you're having an uptick in the infection rate here in Miami-Dade County. We need to bring that down below 10 percent. So we have to roll back some of the things that we did.
Our problem too is that a lot of people didn't take personal responsibility. They didn't wear their masks. They didn't wear their masks outdoors when they were within six feet. And so those rules have been in place since mid-April.
And unfortunately, a lot of our young people are not complying with those rules. They're getting together, they're partying, and they're not wearing their mask. And this contagion really took off with that young, you know, that young demographic 18 to 34, 35 to 45 age group, they just shut up --
BLITZER: Yes.
GIMENEZ: -- and now we're seeing the results of that.
BLITZER: And I don't know why it's so hard thousands of lives will be saved. If people just wear the mask, wash their hands, engage in social distancing, lives will be saved. These are simple things to do, but so many people are simply not doing it and it's so awful to see them out in the streets behaving the way they are.
Mayor Gimenez, good luck to everyone in Miami-Dade. Appreciate it very much you're joining us.
GIMENEZ: Thank you. Thank you, Wolf. I really do.
BLITZER: Thank you. Coming up. We're going to have a live update from the country that trails only the United States right now in coronavirus infections and deaths. We're talking about Brazil and its president also pushing businesses to reopen.
And later, will professional sports resume here in the U.S. anytime this year? We'll have an update.
[17:44:08]
BLITZER: Brazil ranks second to the United States for the most coronavirus cases and deaths of any country in the world, yet it's pushing ahead with reopening businesses in its largest cities. CNN's Bill Weir is in Sao Paulo for us right now. So set the scene for us, Bill, what are you seeing?
BILL WEIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, a lot of the businesses were only allowed to be open for about six hours today, usually in the middle of the day. So we're seeing folks sort of trickle in and out of the shops here as they get closer to closing time. There's a mall across the street that was opened today for the first time as people get to sit down in restaurants at 40 percent capacity or so.
But in the shopping district, in the center of old town today, I saw people elbow to elbow and not all the masks were at full mask, so to speak. And a lot of that has to do with much the way Brazil as the United States, the pandemic has become really politicalized down here. [17:45:03]
Thanks to the man in charge, President Bolsonaro of Brazil from the beginning has dismissed COVID-19 as a little flu, that Brazilians are strong enough to handle. He poo-pooed calls from the health ministry to social distance and to quarantine. In fact, he fired his health minister, a lot of people were worried that President Trump would fire Dr. Fauci. Well, Bolsonaro did that. The replacement quit after a month and now the man in charge of the pandemic response is a loyal army general who has no health policy experience at all.
But what's interesting at the same time is Brazil is now the site of two major vaccine sort of phase 3 trials. Thousands of Brazilians would volunteer to get very promising medicines. But, Wolf, have those probably even in the best case, won't be ready for public consumption until this time next year.
BLITZER: Yes, it's an awful situation in Brazil as well. All right, Bill Weir on the scene for us. Thank you very much.
Coming up, Major League sports struggling to find a way to practice and play safely as the pandemic puts upcoming seasons in jeopardy. Plus, the White House defending President Trump's baseless claim that 99 percent of coronavirus cases here in the United States are quote, totally harmless.
[17:51:12]
BLITZER: This just coming into THE SITUATION ROOM. The Mayor of Atlanta, Keisha Lance Bottoms has just announced that she has coronavirus. She just tweeted and I'll read it to you, ""COVID-19 has literally hit home. I have had no symptoms and have tested positive"". We, of course, wish her only, only the best. Hope she continues to have no symptoms.
And, you know, obviously she's going to have to be in quarantine for a while and we know she has four kids as well. Hope all of them are going to be fine at the same time. We wish Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms only, only the best. It's disturbing news, hits home indeed.
Other important news we're following right now, dozens, dozens of Major League sports players have now also tested positive for the coronavirus but that's just one of the many hurdles putting the future of play this year in some serious jeopardy. CNN's Brian Todd is working this part of the story for us. Brian, every team in every league is struggling right now big time with how to practice, how to play safely during this awful pandemic.
BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It is a struggle for all of them, Wolf. With a rash of positive tests recently, teams are trying to figure all of this out as they go. Some of them tonight putting at least a temporary halt to their training.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TODD (voice-over): Today, both teams that were in last year's World Series, the Washington Nationals and Houston Astros temporarily canceled summer workouts, nervously awaiting delayed coronavirus test results. A top pitcher on the world champion nationals expressing frustration that rising cases across the country are jeopardizing the return of sports.
SEAN DOOLITTLE, WASHINGTON NATIONALS RELIEF PITCHER: Sports are like the reward of a functioning -- a functional society and we're just like trying to just bring it back, even though we've taken none of the steps to have -- to flatten the curve.
TODD (voice-over): Tonight, the major sports leagues that are planning to return to action this month are seemingly being stopped by the resurgent virus. More than three dozen Major League Baseball players and team staffers have tested positive. The National Hockey League reporting similar numbers. And in the NBA, no fewer than five teams have now shut down practice facilities after positive tests. All of it throwing into question the wisdom of these leagues returning to action now.
BARRY SVRLUGA, SPORTS COLUMNIST, THE WASHINGTON POST: It seems like it's somewhere between unrealistic and irresponsible. We're three weeks away from those openers. We've got positive tests among players, we've got workouts that are shutting down. It seems right for some combination of realism and skepticism about whether these sports can return.
TODD (voice-over): Some players in the NBA and Major League Baseball have opted not to return for these shortened seasons. One of baseball's top stars, the Angels Mike Trout whose wife is expecting their first child could be ready to shelve it.
MIKE TROUT, ANAHEIM ANGELS OUTFIELDER: Honestly, I still don't feel comfortable, you know, obviously, with the baby coming. There's a lot of stuff going through my mind right now and my wife's mind.
TODD (voice-over): All the leagues have elaborate plans for players to live and play these seasons in isolation. The NBA going to a so-called bubble in Orlando. Players isolating in hotels, playing all their games in one place. But one medical expert says it's problematic that some states where these leagues are practicing and playing like Florida, Texas and Arizona are among the worst coronavirus hotspots in the country.
DR. AMESH ADALJA, JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY CENTER FOR HEALTH SECURITY: You'd probably want to have this ideally in a place where if they do break their bubble, if they are in contact with people from the community, that the risk of them running into a coronavirus case is very low. So maybe they should be having these things in Alaska or in Vermont where the percent positivity is very low.
TODD (voice-over): With all the precautions, observers say the bottom line is that the leagues are putting their expensive workforce and maybe even more vulnerable coaches and staff members at risk. For one obvious reason. [17:55:06]
SVRLUGA: This isn't about, yay, we can play baseball. This is about if we have a baseball season, we will get some measure of television revenue back even if there are no fans in the stands.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
TODD: But sports journalists and medical experts say there's also a very good chance that these leagues will be able to start their seasons again, but not be able to finish them if players break their bubbles. If a given team experiences its own outbreak. If we return to another nationwide spike in cases this fall, all of it is a recipe to have to shut down sports again. Wolf?
BLITZER: Brian Todd reporting for us. You and I are big sports fans. We hope they play safely.
All right, there's more breaking news we're following, 130,000 Americans now dead in the coronavirus pandemic, as cases are rising right now in 32 states."
139,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1251/Files (250).DOCX","The New York Times",2020-10-24,"3878 words","BUSINESS; media","Edmund Lee",NA,"The White Issue: Has Anna Wintour’s Diversity Push Come Too Late?",FALSE,"Vogue’s September issue was different this year. Anna Wintour and her staff put it together when more than 15 million people were marching in Black Lives Matter protests nationwide and employees at Vogue’s parent company, Condé Nast, were publicly calling out what they viewed as racism in their own workplace. At 316 pages, the issue, titled “Hope,” featured a majority of Black artists, models and photographers, a first for the magazine.
For members of Vogue’s editorial team, the September edition came in the uneasy wake of an internal email Ms. Wintour had sent on June 4. “I want to say plainly that I know Vogue has not found enough ways to elevate and give space to Black editors, writers, photographers, designers and other creators,” wrote Ms. Wintour, the Vogue editor in chief since 1988 and Condé Nast’s artistic director since 2013, making her the editorial leader of all its titles. “We have made mistakes, too, publishing images or stories that have been hurtful or intolerant. I take full responsibility for those mistakes.”
Black editors who have worked with Ms. Wintour said they saw her apology as hypocritical, part of a calculated play by an executive known for her ability to gauge the public mood. Other Black journalists who are current or former employees of Condé Nast said the email and the September issue that followed it represented an awkward, though heartfelt, attempt at genuine change.
More than any other institution, Vogue has defined fashion and beauty for generations of women, and the runway looks encouraged by the London-born Ms. Wintour, 70, have trickled down from haute couture houses to fast-fashion retailers and into the hands of everyday consumers. From Manhattan to Hollywood and beyond, she has helped set a standard that has favored white, Eurocentric notions of beauty.
The rare magazine editor who is known outside the publishing industry, Ms. Wintour — she is simply “Anna” to those in the know, or those who want to be — has become a singular cultural figure. After establishing herself in fashion, media and entertainment in the first part of a career that stretches to the 1970s, she has more recently become a political power player as a bundler for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. And as the orchestrator of the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute benefit, better known as the Met Gala, she has transformed an affair for Manhattan’s society set into a full-blown East Coast Oscars, with luminaries from fashion, music, movies and sports on the Anna-controlled guest list.
As Ms. Wintour ascended, Vogue’s publication of “hurtful or intolerant” content rarely resulted in lasting negative attention for her. But Black journalists who have worked with Ms. Wintour, speaking on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution, said they had not gotten over their experiences at a magazine whose workplace mirrored its exclusive pages.
Under Ms. Wintour, 18 people said, Vogue welcomed a certain type of employee — someone who is thin and white, typically from a wealthy family and educated at elite schools. Of the 18, 11 people said that, in their view, Ms. Wintour should no longer be in charge of Vogue and should give up her post as Condé Nast’s editorial leader.
“Fashion is bitchy,” one former Black staff member said. “It’s hard. This is the way it’s supposed to be. But at Vogue, when we’d evaluate a shoot or a look, we’d say ‘That’s Vogue,’ or, ‘That’s not Vogue,’ and what that really meant was ‘thin, rich and white.’ How do you work in that environment?”
Many of the people interviewed for this article said the racism they encountered was usually subtle, but sometimes blunt. Their main accusation was that Ms. Wintour created a work environment — and there is no facet of Vogue that she does not control — that sidelined and tokenized women of color, especially Black women.
Many Black people who worked for her said they felt so out of place in Ms. Wintour’s domain that they created white alter egos — two used the term “doppelgänger” — just to get through the workday, reconditioning their presentation and dress in a way that was mentally draining.
Some Black editors did not want to comment on the experience of fellow colleagues, but offered another view. Lindsay Peoples Wagner, the editor of Teen Vogue since 2018, said she had experienced uncomfortable moments in the industry but that Ms. Wintour “has given me opportunities in leadership, and I’ve made inclusivity a deep part of the conversations we’re having.”
Three other people of color said Condé Nast had made positive changes and Ms. Wintour had promoted them to top roles. Naomi Campbell, one of the first Black supermodels, who was on the cover of Ms. Wintour’s first September issue in 1989, vehemently defended the editor.
“The first cover try I ever did, I had no idea she had to fight for me,” Ms. Campbell said. “She’s been a very important factor in my career and my life and has been honest about what she can do and what she cannot.”
The recent tumult at Condé Nast has knocked Ms. Wintour off balance. Inspired by the protests that arose after the police killing of George Floyd in May, employees have confronted their bosses at companywide meetings and in smaller gatherings. Their complaints have led to the resignations of key editors and pledges from the chief executive, Roger Lynch, and Ms. Wintour herself, to revamp Condé Nast’s hiring practices.
“I strongly believe that the most important thing any of us can do in our work is to provide opportunities for those who may not have had access to them,” Ms. Wintour said in an emailed statement. “Undoubtedly, I have made mistakes along the way, and if any mistakes were made at Vogue under my watch, they are mine to own and remedy and I am committed to doing the work.”
Devoting the September issue — the most important of Vogue’s year — to Black contributors indicates Ms. Wintour grasps the intensity of the protest movement roiling the country. But in fashion, of course, appearances are paramount. During a large Condé Nast meeting on race in June, Ms. Wintour — who is the head of the company’s diversity and inclusion council — was conspicuously absent. Employees exchanged Slack and text messages during the session, asking the same question: “Where’s Anna?”
‘Well I honestly don’t think that’s a big deal’
Long before Condé Nast employees went public with complaints about the company’s handling of race, Ms. Wintour has been criticized for Vogue’s portrayals of Black people.
For many readers, a 2008 cover of LeBron James and Gisele Bündchen was reminiscent of racist images of Black men from a century ago. The basketball star is bellowing and gripping the supermodel around the waist, and some saw an unmistakable parallel to a racist World War I propaganda poster. Ms. Wintour also drew criticism when she helped the fashion designer John Galliano, who was fired from Christian Dior in 2011 after he was caught on camera making anti-Semitic remarks and declaring, “I love Hitler.” She continued to support Mr. Galliano even after he was found guilty of a hate crime by a Paris court.
Being indisputably the most important magazine in fashion means Vogue comes in for extra scrutiny — especially in its cover selections. Last year, The Pudding, a publisher of visual essays, used algorithms to analyze 19 years of the Vogue archives and measure the average “lightness” of cover models’ skin tones. In one span, from 2000 to 2005, only three of 81 women were Black. In a statement, Condé Nast said that from 2017 to 2020, 32 percent of Vogue covers featured Black women.
Former Vogue employees said that in recent years, Ms. Wintour has not kept pace with the public’s changing attitudes on issues of racism and discrimination. At a London fashion week party hosted by Burberry in February 2017, the reality TV star Kendall Jenner showed up with a new look: fake gold teeth. Vogue noted the choice in a breezy online story written by a white contributor: “The flashing teeth felt like a playful wink to the city’s free-spirited aesthetic — or perhaps a proverbial kiss to her rumored boyfriend, A$AP Rocky.”
A Black staff member contacted one of the magazine’s executives to object, saying the story insensitively endorsed an instance of cultural appropriation, according to emails obtained by The New York Times. Other staff members brought the article to Ms. Wintour’s attention, with one lieutenant explaining by email why some people on staff and on social media had reacted negatively: “If Kendall wants to do something stupid fine but our writers (especially white ones) don’t need to weigh in and glorify it or ascribe reasons to it that read culturally insensitive.”
Ms. Wintour appeared not to grasp the issue. After several exchanges, she wrote: “Well I honestly don’t think that’s a big deal.”
Condé Nast said in a statement: “The coverage itself is not cultural appropriation.”
Vogue’s content has, though, been accused of being exactly that. The March 2017 issue showcased Karlie Kloss, a white model, in a geisha outfit, with her face in pale makeup and her hair dyed black — a blatant form of yellowface. Readers condemned the layout, which was shot in Japan by Mikael Jansson and included a photograph of Ms. Kloss with a sumo wrestler. New York Magazine’s fashion site The Cut was among the many critics, writing: “One thing’s for certain: Embracing diversity does not mean styling Karlie Kloss as a geisha.”
A Condé Nast human resources executive in charge of the company’s diversity program fielded numerous complaints, and alerted Ms. Wintour. According to three people with direct knowledge of the exchange, Ms. Wintour responded that she took full responsibility, but added the feature could not have been cut because of its “enormous expense.”
After an online outcry, Ms. Kloss issued an apology on Twitter: “These images appropriate a culture that is not my own and I am truly sorry for participating in a shoot that was not culturally sensitive.”
The tweet angered Ms. Wintour, according to the three people, and Ms. Kloss sent a note in an effort to mollify her. “I imagine the feeling is mutual, that it was hurtful to see the criticism from our Japan trip,” the model wrote. “I had written a short piece on social media as I wanted to make known that it was never my intention to offend or upset anyone from this spread.”
Ms. Wintour’s reply the following day was icy: “Thanks Karlie another time please give us a heads up if you are writing about a Vogue issue.” (Ms. Kloss has continued to appear in the magazine’s pages.)
In the fall of 2017, there was yet another awkward exchange on race between Ms. Wintour and Vogue staff members. It concerned a photo shoot by Patrick Demarchelier that showed several dark-skinned Black models wearing head scarves.
As Ms. Wintour weighed whether to publish the images, she asked an employee by email if they might be misconstrued as racist. But she flubbed the attempt, using a dated, offensive term: “Don’t mean to use an inappropriate word, but pica ninny came to mind,” Ms. Wintour wrote.
In a statement, Ms. Wintour said: “I was trying both to express my concern for how our readers could have interpreted a photo and raise the issue for discussion, and I used a term that was offensive. And for that, I truly apologize.”
In the 2017 email, Ms. Wintour requested that a specific Black staff member evaluate the photo shoot. The employee, an assistant, told her superiors that the work was fine. The real problem, she continued, according to several people familiar with the meeting, was why a low-ranked person such as herself had been asked to assess it. The room fell into an uncomfortable silence.
‘A colonial broad’
For Ms. Wintour, who descends from British nobility and was recently made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, the pace of the current moment of protest may be a challenge. But she is also the daughter of a London newspaper editor and has made a career out of anticipating and responding adroitly to cultural trends.
In 2016, Ms. Wintour made a change to her pool of assistants. (She had three aides for many years, but more recently has had two.) That year, according to three Condé Nast employees, she told the company’s human resources department that her next assistant should be Black. Eventually, most of her assistants were people of color, the people said. The job is highly sought after, a steppingstone to bigger roles in fashion and media, but because it is low-paying, it usually goes to women from wealthy families. The sight of Ms. Wintour’s new adjutants made for a vivid contrast with the usual Vogue hires.
In 2017, Ms. Wintour was part of the small committee that decided to replace the departing Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter with Radhika Jones, the editorial director of the books department at The Times, making her one of the few top editors of color in Condé Nast’s history. Ms. Wintour has since championed Ms. Jones against in-house naysayers who complained that she had featured too many people of color in Vanity Fair. “My experiences with Anna have been nothing but positive,” Ms. Jones said. “She’s supportive of my vision and she understands what I’ve been trying to achieve and she has helped me to achieve it.”
Last month, Ms. Wintour replaced Stuart Emmrich, a former Styles editor at The Times, as the editor of the Vogue website with Chioma Nnadi, a Black woman who had been the magazine’s fashion director. And in August, Ms. Wintour was instrumental in the hiring of the superstar book executive Dawn Davis, who is Black, as the editor of Bon Appétit. (She replaced Adam Rapoport, who resigned under pressure in June after staff members accused him of running a discriminatory workplace.)
In a statement, Condé Nast said that 42 percent of its editors in chief were now people of color — all of them put in place by Ms. Wintour — and that all photo shoots are ultimately overseen by Raúl Martinez, the corporate creative director, who is the son of Cuban émigrés.
Some of Ms. Wintour’s relationships with Black editors have been rocky. André Leon Talley, a fashion titan, was one of Vogue’s most recognized personalities, often seated beside Ms. Wintour in the front row at runway shows in Paris, Milan and New York. She lavished professional and financial support on Mr. Talley, but the two had a falling-out, and he left the magazine in 2013.
This year, he published a memoir, “The Chiffon Trenches,” which reads in part as a scathing takedown of the fashion industry for its whiteness. During a promotional interview, a podcaster asked Mr. Talley about Ms. Wintour’s apology for Vogue’s “hurtful or intolerant” content. “Dame Anna Wintour is a colonial broad,” Mr. Talley replied. “She’s part of an environment of colonialism. She is entitled and I do not think she will ever let anything get in the way of her white privilege.”
Edward Enninful, a Black editor at Condé Nast who has led British Vogue since 2017, is among the next generation of Condé Nast leaders, and is often mentioned as Ms. Wintour’s potential successor at the magazine’s American flagship. The two are said to have a difficult working relationship, according to people in New York and London who have directly observed their dynamic. (In July, Mr. Enninful said that a security guard at Condé Nast’s London office racially profiled him, telling him to “use the loading bay.” Mr. Enninful described the incident on Instagram, writing “Change needs to happen now.” Condé Nast dismissed the guard, he said, and the post has since been deleted.)
When Ms. Wintour promoted Elaine Welteroth, a Black woman, to a top position at Teen Vogue in 2016, the appointment was heralded as a step forward for diversity. But the promotion was fraught, Ms. Welteroth wrote in her 2019 memoir, “More Than Enough.” Instead of running Teen Vogue herself, as the editor in chief, she was given a more ambiguous title, “editor,” and was asked to split leadership of the publication with two others. Ms. Welteroth felt that the structure effectively sidelined her, giving her less power than that of the previous Teen Vogue boss, Amy Astley. (A year after her appointment, Ms. Welteroth was named editor in chief. She left Condé Nast in 2018.)
“Would any of it have gone down this way if I were a White man?” Ms. Welteroth wrote.
A summer of discontent
The killing of Mr. Floyd sparked difficult discussions about race and diversity in magazines and newspapers across the country, including at The Times. Employees everywhere have become more vocal about what they see as racist attitudes in the workplace.
At Condé Nast, Bon Appétit, a rising profit center thanks in part to its popular cooking videos, has been the red-hot center of dissent in recent months, with many of its staff members quitting in protest. Before the hiring of Ms. Davis to lead the magazine, Ms. Wintour watched closely over its editorial operations, people who worked at the property said.
At the time, people of color who had been featured in the videos complained that they were paid less than their white colleagues and that Bon Appétit had whitewashed their recipes — a trend in food journalism where ethnic cuisines are recast from a white perspective. Readers flooded the comments section of Bon Appétit’s Instagram account with messages of support for those who complained.
In a post to Bon Appétit’s account, Priya Krishna, a freelancer who had accused Condé Nast of unequal pay, was quoted as saying: “I have been forced to think outside of myself and my identity my entire career. So why can’t white editors change their mindset now?”
Ms. Wintour asked to have the item removed, according to internal Condé Nast Slack messages. But by the time of her request, the Krishna post had been online for hours, and Ms. Wintour was warned that deleting it would only attract more attention. The social media team suggested posting new content that would push the item down in users’ feeds. Ms. Wintour approved the plan, according to two people involved in the discussion.
Marcus Samuelsson, a celebrity chef who signed a one-year agreement with Condé Nast as a Bon Appétit consultant, said the company’s history with diversity “was challenging,” but he added that Ms. Wintour had worked to create more inclusivity. “She championed it from Day 1,” he said.
Many people who have worked at Vogue or with Ms. Wintour said that despite her moves toward a more diverse staff, she was still responsible for a hostile workplace. They singled out two of Ms. Wintour’s best known lieutenants: Phyllis Posnick, a Vogue editor who styled the 2017 geisha and head scarf shoots, and Grace Coddington, another fixture at the magazine.
In the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election, as staff members were despondent that Mrs. Clinton had lost to Donald J. Trump, Ms. Posnick said, in a voice that three people could hear, “I knew this was going to happen. It’s all the Blacks’ fault. They didn’t vote.” The next year, when Rihanna showed up late for Vogue’s annual fashion conference — hardly an unusual occurrence for a musician — two people heard Ms. Coddington say, “Black people are late everywhere.”
In a statement, Ms. Posnick, 78, denied making the comment. “I have never and would never say something like this for the simple fact that I don’t believe it,” she said. Ms. Coddington, 79, also disputed that she had made the Rihanna remark: “Why would I say that when I am perennially late myself?”
Ms. Coddington is perhaps the second-most visible figure of the Wintour era at Vogue, having stolen multiple scenes in “The September Issue,” a popular 2009 documentary about the magazine. In 2016, the year she switched her Vogue status from employee to freelancer, Ms. Coddington was photographed in her Manhattan kitchen, with a shelf of racist “mammy” figurines clearly visible in the background. The collection was roundly criticized.
In a statement, Condé Nast noted that Ms. Posnick and Ms. Coddington no longer contributed to the magazine.
‘Condé Nasty’
To work at Vogue is to inhabit a kind of prep school dormitory where relationships are defined by family ties and social connections that span generations. For many younger people of color who came from less rarefied backgrounds, gaining a toehold was considerably more difficult.
Condé Nast assistants famously put up with grueling hours and humiliating tasks, a job satirized in “The Devil Wears Prada,” a best-selling novel by a former Wintour assistant and later a hit movie starring Meryl Streep as the demanding boss. The hazing is seen as a rite of passage, part of why the company has the nickname “Condé Nasty.” And while Black staff members acknowledge all that, they said that race complicates matters.
Black employees are often asked to participate, or merely show up for, high-level meetings — a corporate practice known as fronting, six people interviewed for this article said. At Vogue, they have been asked to weigh in on cover images or take part in discussions with advertisers, forums that do not typically call on junior employees.
In a statement, Condé Nast said, “Anna and Vogue and all the leaders at our brands have made concerted efforts to build inclusion into all we do every day.”
In 2016, the actress Lupita Nyong’o showed up at Vogue’s office at One World Trade in Lower Manhattan to discuss a planned photo shoot. Ms. Nyong’o sat down with top editors, who had proposed photographing her in her home country, Kenya, along with some family members. The accompanying article would also focus on her family.
Ms. Nyong’o expressed concern about how her family would be portrayed, saying she feared they might come across as cultural props, according to several people with knowledge of the meeting. After a long pause, a junior editor — the only Black staff member in the room — piped up. Addressing the actress, she suggested that the shoot would be an opportunity to showcase Africa, a rarity in any American magazine, let alone Vogue.
The shoot was a go. And the junior editor was never asked to attend a fashion meeting again.

140,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1251/Files (250).DOCX","The New York Times",2020-10-25,"3719 words","Section BU; Column 0; Money and Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 1","By Edmund Lee",NA,"The White Issue",FALSE,"Vogue's September issue was different this year. Anna Wintour and her staff put it together when more than 15 million people were marching in Black Lives Matter protests nationwide and employees at Vogue's parent company, Condé Nast, were publicly calling out what they viewed as racism in their own workplace. At 316 pages, the issue, titled ''Hope,'' featured a majority of Black artists, models and photographers, a first for the magazine.
For members of Vogue's editorial team, the September edition came in the uneasy wake of an internal email Ms. Wintour had sent on June 4. ''I want to say plainly that I know Vogue has not found enough ways to elevate and give space to Black editors, writers, photographers, designers and other creators,'' wrote Ms. Wintour, the Vogue editor in chief since 1988 and Condé Nast's artistic director since 2013, making her the editorial leader of all its titles. ''We have made mistakes, too, publishing images or stories that have been hurtful or intolerant. I take full responsibility for those mistakes.'' 
 Black editors who have worked with Ms. Wintour said they saw her apology as hypocritical, part of a calculated play by an executive known for her ability to gauge the public mood. Other Black journalists who are current or former employees of Condé Nast said the email and the September issue that followed it represented an awkward, though heartfelt, attempt at genuine change.
 More than any other institution, Vogue has defined fashion and beauty for generations of women, and the runway looks encouraged by the London-born Ms. Wintour, 70, have trickled down from haute couture houses to fast-fashion retailers and into the hands of everyday consumers. From Manhattan to Hollywood and beyond, she has helped set a standard that has favored white, Eurocentric notions of beauty.
 The rare magazine editor who is known outside the publishing industry, Ms. Wintour -- she is simply ''Anna'' to those in the know, or those who want to be -- has become a singular cultural figure. After establishing herself in fashion, media and entertainment in the first part of a career that stretches to the 1970s, she has more recently become a political power player as a bundler for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. And as the orchestrator of the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute benefit, better known as the Met Gala, she has transformed an affair for Manhattan's society set into a full-blown East Coast Oscars, with luminaries from fashion, music, movies and sports on the Anna-controlled guest list.
 As Ms. Wintour ascended, Vogue's publication of ''hurtful or intolerant'' content rarely resulted in lasting negative attention for her. But Black journalists who have worked with Ms. Wintour, speaking on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution, said they had not gotten over their experiences at a magazine whose workplace mirrored its exclusive pages.
 Under Ms. Wintour, 18 people said, Vogue welcomed a certain type of employee -- someone who is thin and white, typically from a wealthy family and educated at elite schools. Of the 18, 11 people said that, in their view, Ms. Wintour should no longer be in charge of Vogue and should give up her post as Condé Nast's editorial leader.
 ''Fashion is bitchy,'' one former Black staff member said. ''It's hard. This is the way it's supposed to be. But at Vogue, when we'd evaluate a shoot or a look, we'd say 'That's Vogue,' or, 'That's not Vogue,' and what that really meant was 'thin, rich and white.' How do you work in that environment?''
 Many of the people interviewed for this article said the racism they encountered was usually subtle, but sometimes blunt. Their main accusation was that Ms. Wintour created a work environment -- and there is no facet of Vogue that she does not control -- that sidelined and tokenized women of color, especially Black women.
 Many Black people who worked for her said they felt so out of place in Ms. Wintour's domain that they created white alter egos -- two used the term ''doppelgänger'' -- just to get through the workday, reconditioning their presentation and dress in a way that was mentally draining.
 Some Black editors did not want to comment on the experience of fellow colleagues, but offered another view. Lindsay Peoples Wagner, the editor of Teen Vogue since 2018, said she had experienced uncomfortable moments in the industry but that Ms. Wintour ''has given me opportunities in leadership, and I've made inclusivity a deep part of the conversations we're having.''
 Three other people of color said Condé Nast had made positive changes and Ms. Wintour had promoted them to top roles. Naomi Campbell, one of the first Black supermodels, who was on the cover of Ms. Wintour's first September issue in 1989, vehemently defended the editor.
 ''The first cover try I ever did, I had no idea she had to fight for me,'' Ms. Campbell said. ''She's been a very important factor in my career and my life and has been honest about what she can do and what she cannot.''
 The recent tumult at Condé Nast has knocked Ms. Wintour off balance. Inspired by the protests that arose after the police killing of George Floyd in May, employees have confronted their bosses at companywide meetings and in smaller gatherings. Their complaints have led to the resignations of key editors and pledges from the chief executive, Roger Lynch, and Ms. Wintour herself, to revamp Condé Nast's hiring practices.
 ''I strongly believe that the most important thing any of us can do in our work is to provide opportunities for those who may not have had access to them,'' Ms. Wintour said in an emailed statement. ''Undoubtedly, I have made mistakes along the way, and if any mistakes were made at Vogue under my watch, they are mine to own and remedy and I am committed to doing the work.''
 Devoting the September issue -- the most important of Vogue's year -- to Black contributors indicates Ms. Wintour grasps the intensity of the protest movement roiling the country. But in fashion, of course, appearances are paramount. During a large Condé Nast meeting on race in June, Ms. Wintour -- who is the head of the company's diversity and inclusion council -- was conspicuously absent. Employees exchanged Slack and text messages during the session, asking the same question: ''Where's Anna?''
 'Well I honestly don't think that's a big deal'
 Long before Condé Nast employees went public with complaints about the company's handling of race, Ms. Wintour has been criticized for Vogue's portrayals of Black people.
 For many readers, a 2008 cover of LeBron James and Gisele Bündchen was reminiscent of racist images of Black men from a century ago. The basketball star is bellowing and gripping the supermodel around the waist, and some saw an unmistakable parallel to a racist World War I propaganda poster. Ms. Wintour also drew criticism when she helped the fashion designer John Galliano, who was fired from Christian Dior in 2011 after he was caught on camera making anti-Semitic remarks and declaring, ''I love Hitler.'' She continued to support Mr. Galliano even after he was found guilty of a hate crime by a Paris court.
 Being indisputably the most important magazine in fashion means Vogue comes in for extra scrutiny -- especially in its cover selections.

But by the time of her request, the Krishna post had been online for hours, and Ms. Wintour was warned that deleting it would only attract more attention. The social media team suggested posting new content that would push the item down in users' feeds. Ms. Wintour approved the plan, according to two people involved in the discussion.
 Marcus Samuelsson, a celebrity chef who signed a one-year agreement with Condé Nast as a Bon Appétit consultant, said the company's history with diversity ''was challenging,'' but he added that Ms. Wintour had worked to create more inclusivity. ''She championed it from Day 1,'' he said.
 Many people who have worked at Vogue or with Ms. Wintour said that despite her moves toward a more diverse staff, she was still responsible for a hostile workplace. They singled out two of Ms. Wintour's best known lieutenants: Phyllis Posnick, a Vogue editor who styled the 2017 geisha and head scarf shoots, and Grace Coddington, another fixture at the magazine.
 In the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election, as staff members were despondent that Mrs. Clinton had lost to Donald J. Trump, Ms. Posnick said, in a voice that three people could hear, ''I knew this was going to happen. It's all the Blacks' fault. They didn't vote.'' The next year, when Rihanna showed up late for Vogue's annual fashion conference -- hardly an unusual occurrence for a musician -- two people heard Ms. Coddington say, ''Black people are late everywhere.''
 In a statement, Ms. Posnick, 78, denied making the comment. ''I have never and would never say something like this for the simple fact that I don't believe it,'' she said. Ms. Coddington, 79, also disputed that she had made the Rihanna remark: ''Why would I say that when I am perennially late myself?''
 Ms. Coddington is perhaps the second-most visible figure of the Wintour era at Vogue, having stolen multiple scenes in ''The September Issue,'' a popular 2009 documentary about the magazine. In 2016, the year she switched her Vogue status from employee to freelancer, Ms. Coddington was photographed in her Manhattan kitchen, with a shelf of racist ''mammy'' figurines clearly visible in the background. The collection was roundly criticized.
 In a statement, Condé Nast noted that Ms. Posnick and Ms. Coddington no longer contributed to the magazine.
 'Condé Nasty'
 To work at Vogue is to inhabit a kind of prep school dormitory where relationships are defined by family ties and social connections that span generations. For many younger people of color who came from less rarefied backgrounds, gaining a toehold was considerably more difficult.
 Condé Nast assistants famously put up with grueling hours and humiliating tasks, a job satirized in ''The Devil Wears Prada,'' a best-selling novel by a former Wintour assistant and later a hit movie starring Meryl Streep as the demanding boss. The hazing is seen as a rite of passage, part of why the company has the nickname ''Condé Nasty.'' And while Black staff members acknowledge all that, they said that race complicates matters.
 Black employees are often asked to participate, or merely show up for, high-level meetings -- a corporate practice known as fronting, six people interviewed for this article said. At Vogue, they have been asked to weigh in on cover images or take part in discussions with advertisers, forums that do not typically call on junior employees.
 In a statement, Condé Nast said, ''Anna and Vogue and all the leaders at our brands have made concerted efforts to build inclusion into all we do every day.''
 In 2016, the actress Lupita Nyong'o showed up at Vogue's office at One World Trade in Lower Manhattan to discuss a planned photo shoot. Ms. Nyong'o sat down with top editors, who had proposed photographing her in her home country, Kenya, along with some family members. The accompanying article would also focus on her family.
 Ms. Nyong'o expressed concern about how her family would be portrayed, saying she feared they might come across as cultural props, according to several people with knowledge of the meeting. After a long pause, a junior editor -- the only Black staff member in the room -- piped up. Addressing the actress, she suggested that the shoot would be an opportunity to showcase Africa, a rarity in any American magazine, let alone Vogue.
 The shoot was a go. And the junior editor was never asked to attend a fashion meeting again.

Two church buildings— one Baptist, one Catholic— were damaged by fires in apparent arson attacks Sunday morning in Brewster, a town in central Washington.
Sacred Heart Catholic Church suffered some fire damage near the sanctuary from an incendiary device dropped through a broken window early Nov. 15. New Testament Baptist Church, located a block away, suffered more serious fire damage to its interior the same morning.
Investigators have deemed the fire at Sacred Heart to be intentional, police say. The police have not yet made the same pronouncement about the fire at the Baptist church, but the investigation is ongoing.
Father Pedro Bautista, Sacred Heart's pastor, told CNA that most of Sacred Heart's parishioners are Hispanic, and that the community is ""fearful"" after the incident.
""This is just adding more stress to the lives of the people,"" he said.
Father Bautista said he noticed the fire when he came to open the church on Sunday morning. At that point, the local fire department was already battling the fire at the nearby Baptist church, which appears to have been set around 2 am, and was discovered around 5 am.
The fire damaged a chair and some carpet near the sanctuary at Sacred Heart. Father Bautista said the fire department and the police were surprised that the fire did not do more damage.
The fire at the Baptist church did not entirely destroy the building, but the damage to the interior was significant enough that the building may be beyond salvage, local media reported.
Father Bautista said he left his card with the fire chief— who attends the Baptist church that burned— asking him to tell the church's pastor that they are welcome to use Sacred Heart's parish hall as a gathering space until their church is repaired.
""Honestly, that was my first thought. I wanted to talk to them and offer them [our] building. I didn't realize [someone] had burned our church too,"" he laughed.
The priest said he does not know who could have set the fires, and chose not to speculate. The investigation is still in its early stages, he noted, and he said he does not want to feed rumors in the community.
He said he considers his parish to be blessed that their insurance will likely cover the incident, and that he was still able to celebrate 2pm Sunday Mass the day of the fire.
""People were comforted that we were still able to have the Eucharist, that is a big statement for the community,"" he said.
The Brewster Police Department said in a Nov. 16 statement that the two fires remain under investigation. The police have not announced any suspects.
Brewster PD Chief Marcos Ruiz declined to comment further to CNA, adding that the department does not have plans to release additional information on the active investigation.
The Diocese of Spokane requested prayers for the Sacred Heart community in a tweet on Sunday. The diocese did not comment further by press time.
Numerous attacks on Catholic churches and art in the U.S. have been documented throughout 2020— including three separate desecrations of Marian statues in the same weekend in July.
At least three vandalism attacks have happened against images of Mary this year in New York City alone.
The Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate Conception in Denver was defaced with graffiti during a protest June 1, with rioters spray-painting slogans such as ""GOD IS DEAD"" and ""PEDOFILES"" [sic] on the church's exterior.
A statue of the Virgin Mary was beheaded in Gary the evening of July 2 or morning of July 3.
On July 11, a man was arrested after he reportedly admitted to crashing a minivan into Queen of Peace Catholic Church in Ocala, Florida, and then setting it on fire while parishioners were inside. No one was injured.
Also on July 11, a 249-year-old California mission founded by St. Junipero Serra burned in a fire being investigated as arson.
The same day, a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary was attacked and beheaded at a parish in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Three days later, vandals beheaded a statue of Christ outside Good Shepherd Catholic Church in Southwest Miami-Dade County, the same day that a statue of the Blessed Virgin at St. Mary's Cathedral in Colorado Springs was tagged with red paint in an act of vandalism.
At Our Lady of the Assumption Church in Bloomingburg, New York, a monument to unborn children killed by abortion was knocked over the weekend of July 18.
In late August, vandals beheaded a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary at Holy Family Parish in Citrus Heights, California. A statue of the Ten Commandments, placed at the parish ""in dedication to all those who have lost their life through abortion"" was grafittied with a swastika.
In September, a man went on an hours-long vandalism spree at Immaculate Heart of Mary Catholic Church in Tioga, Louisiana, breaking at least six windows, beating several metal doors, and breaking numerous statues around the parish grounds. He was later arrested and charged.
The same month, vandals toppled a statue of St. Therese outside St. Therese of the Child Jesus Catholic Parish in Midvale, Utah.
Later in September, a man was charged for smashing a 90-year-old statue of Christ inside St. Patrick Cathedral in El Paso.
Also in September, a man wielded a baseball bat on the grounds of a Catholic seminary in Texas and damaged a crucifix and several doors, but caused no harm to seminary students.
St. Peter Chaldean Catholic Cathedral in El Cajon on Sept. 25 was defaced with graffiti depicting ""pentagrams, upside down crosses, white power, swastikas,"" as well as slogans such as ""Biden 2020,"" and ""BLM"".
The same evening, Our Mother of Perpetual Help Catholic Church, also in El Cajon, was similarly attacked, with the pastor discovering spray-painted swastikas on an exterior wall of the church the next day.
In mid-October, vandals knocked down a statue of Mary and a statue of Christ outside St. Germaine Catholic Church in Prescott Valley, Arizona, about 90 miles north of Phoenix.
Throughout the summer, numerous depictions of St. Junipero Serra, mostly in California, have been forcibly pulled down by mobs of protestors.
A crowd of about 100 people tore down another St. Junípero Serra statue in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park the evening of June 19. Rioters pulled down a statue of St. Junipero Serra in Sacramento July 4.
A Oct. 12 protest at Mission San Rafael Arcangel began peacefully but then turned violent, as participants defaced another St. Junipero Serra statue with red paint before dragging it to the ground with nylon straps and ropes. The local district attorney ultimately charged five individuals with felony vandalism in connection with the incident.
Abroad, a recent report chronicled more than 500 hate crimes against Christians in Europe in 2019, included attacks against Catholic priests, arson attacks on Catholic churches, the destruction of images of the Virgin Mary, vandalism of a pregnancy counseling center, and the theft of consecrated Eucharistic hosts from tabernacles.

Cell phone video captured one of the most recent incidents. A man yelled racial slurs at a California family while they were at a birthday dinner. He later apologized. Elaine Quijano of our streaming network CBSN spoke with the family that was targeted. Elaine, what did they say?
ELAINE QUIJANO (CBSN): Well, Vlad, the Orosa family is shaken by what happened. And it almost didn`t get recorded because of the family`s no- phone rule for their celebration dinner. But when a man began harassing them, one of the relatives pulled out their phone and started recording.
(Begin VT)
ELAINE QUIJANO: Raymond Orosa and his wife Marie were celebrating Marie`s birthday and the Fourth of July at a restaurant in California when Orosa says his family became a target.
MICHAEL LOFTHOUSE (internet video): (EXPLETIVE DELETED) you.
ELAINE QUIJANO: Cell phone video showed tech CEO Michael Lofthouse yelling racial slurs at Orosa`s family.
WOMAN (internet video): You need to leave now.
MICHAEL LOFTHOUSE (internet video): You (EXPLETIVE DELETED) Asian piece of (EXPLETIVE DELETED).
ELAINE QUIJANO: Orosa and his wife were born in the Philippines. He says they`ve been U.S. citizens for roughly two decades.
How did you feel when he said those things to you?
RAYMOND OROSA (Racial Abuse Victim): I`ve never felt anything like it, but that-- that for the first time was-- was pretty strong, and I didn`t know what to do.
ELAINE QUIJANO: Other recent harassment or hate crimes against Asian- Americans include a stabbing at a Sam`s Club in Midland, Texas, and an attack on a New York City subway. The FBI predicted the upswing in March, warning law enforcement that harassment of Asian-Americans may increase amid the coronavirus. More than three months later, the numbers are surfacing. According to the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, there have been more than twenty-one hundred reported hate incidents against Asian-Americans since the start of the pandemic. More than eight hundred of those were reported in California.
CYNTHIA CHOI (Chinese for Affirmative Action Co-Executive Director): About seventy percent is what we would constitute verbal harassment.
ELAINE QUIJANO: Cynthia Choi is co-executive director of Chinese for Affirmative Action. She says hundreds of hate crimes are typically reported every year, not thousands.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It comes from China. That`s why.
Kung flu.
This terrible China virus.
ELAINE QUIJANO: Choi believes there`s a connection between rhetoric from the presidential podium to the real-world expressions of bias.
CYNTHIA CHOI: When we look at these first ten accounts of anti-Asian hate, Trump`s name is evoked.
ELAINE QUIJANO: Just like it was last weekend in California. In a statement to several media outlets, Lofthouse apologized, saying, ""My behavior in the video is appalling. This was clearly a moment where I lost control and made incredibly hurtful and divisive comments.""
Do you accept his apology?
RAYMOND OROSA: Yes, I do forgive him. I mean, I`ve done wrong things, too. And-- and I`ve been forgiven. And but in no way am I agreeing to what he`s done. No. I don`t accept the apology.

ELAINE QUIJANO: In a statement to CBS News, the White House says the President has noted on numerous occasions the need to protect the Asian- American community but added he will, quote, ""continue to point to the fact that the origin of the virus is China."" Raymond Orosa told us he has not spoken to Michael Lofthouse directly. When I asked what he would say to the CEO if he had a chance to speak to him, Orosa said he just wants to ask him why. Tony.
TONY DOKOUPIL: Yeah. Elaine, I think why is the question we`re all asking. The FBI anticipated this increase in hate crimes against Asian-Americans. We should reflect today on why it`s happening. I think we know the answer. Elaine, thank you very much.
Ahead, a new development in the fight over the new name of a band formerly known as Lady Antebellum.
But first, it is almost seven forty-three, time to check your local weather.
(LOCAL WEATHER BREAK)
(ANNOUNCEMENTS)
TONY DOKOUPIL: Time to put your Zoom call on mute and dial into Vlad for What to Watch. Vlad, what do you got?
VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Make sure you keep that video rolling.
TONY DOKOUPIL: Yes.
VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: You`ve got to keep the video rolling on the Zoom. Good to see you all. Here are a few stories we think you`ll be talking about today. The Washington Redskins are still thinking about changing the team name, but they are giving up on all the Native American imagery. ESPN reports the team logo will get a makeover, though its team colors of burgundy and gold will stay the same as of now. The team faces renewed pressure from activists who say its long-standing nickname is racist. Big- name retailers like Amazon, Target and Nike have removed Washington Redskins` merchandise from their websites. I think people still want to see the name change. It may be a good first step.
TONY DOKOUPIL: Yeah.
VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Got to change the name.
TONY DOKOUPIL: This is really an incredible development. I mean the conversation around the Redskins has been going on for years. I remember it back in the early 2000s when I was going to school in DC. And the fact that there`s actual movement now really answers the question of why is now different. Well, this is evidence of a real, actual change. Gayle.
GAYLE KING: Mm-Hm. I totally agree with that. I went to University of Maryland, and they were talking about it back then. So, I know this has been a longtime conversation. But I agree, I think change is in the air. Vlad, you`ve got news in the music world I hear.
VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: I do. So, the band formerly known as Lady Antebellum is suing for the right to call itself Lady A. A Seattle-based blues singer has used that same nickname for more than two decades. The country trio claims it reluctantly fire-- filed, rather, a trademark lawsuit after Anita White apparently demanded a ten-million-dollar payment for the rights to the Lady A name. The band argues it trademarked Lady A in 2011 with no opposition, and its fans have used the abbreviation since around 2006. Singer told us last month that she was hopeful that both sides could come to an agreement.
ANITA WHITE: We`re going to continue talking, and we`re going to come to a- - a resolution that`s best for both of us. As I said, I`m keeping my name. And-- and this is going to be a great outcome for everybody is my hope, is my prayer.
VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Should point out that the band is not asking for any money damages. We asked White to comment on the lawsuit. She has not responded. This is-- this is a tough one, Gayle. I mean she, you know, has been using that name for such a long time. Lady Antebellum changed the name in recognition of the moment that we`re living in right now, but the idea that they might be suing to use the name, a black woman, is tough to digest.
GAYLE KING: Yeah. But I mean, fans of Lady Antebellum--and I-- I consider myself one--have been calling them Lady A for a very long time. I just-- it seems like they were trying to work it out and now there is a ten-million- dollar lawsuit. I don`t know.
TONY DOKOUPIL: Yeah.
GAYLE KING: Is it so tough?
VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Well, I hope--
GAYLE KING: I don`t know.
VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: --she says that she`s hopeful that they will work it out.
GAYLE KING: So, She says Lady-- I do, too. And Lady Antebellum made it clear, listen, we`re very sorry, you know, they don`t want to cause any trouble here. It seems like there`s a way the two sides can work it out that doesn`t involve ten million dollars.
VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Yeah.
GAYLE KING: That`s all I`m saying.
VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: And Lady A--
GAYLE KING: So, Vlad, you got a--
VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: --the band, is not suing-- their not-- this lawsuit is not seeking any monetary damages.
GAYLE KING: Exactly.
VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: So, that`s important to point out.
GAYLE KING: No. No. They really all just want to get along. There is a poignant moment in sports. You`ve got that one, too?
VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: I do. So, get this. Nearly two hundred athletes staged a powerful protest just before Major League Soccer resumed its season last night. Members of the group Black Players for Change held an eight-minute forty-six-second moment of silence to protest racial injustice in the police killing of George Floyd. One by one, each player wearing black T- shirts and face masks that read Black Lives Matter raised a gloved fist in the air. Really poignant.
TONY DOKOUPIL: Reminiscent of the Olympics in 1968.
GAYLE KING: Making very strong statement there.
VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Yes. Yes. Very much so, Tony.
GAYLE KING: You still got two.
VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Period of 1968 during the Olympics with the raising of the hands. All right. So--
GAYLE KING: (INDISTINCT) that too.
VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: --one more for you. This is for Anthony Mason because he loves these penguins. The adventures continue for our favorite penguins in the Chicago Shedd Aquarium. Remember, Anthony loves these penguins. Izzy and Darwin waddled--you see them waddling--over to visit dinosaurs at the Field Museum next door. The duo met Maximo the Titanosaur, then said hi to Sue, the real names of the dinosaurs-- Sue, the famous t-rex. The penguins have become social media stars, thanks to videos of them taking all sorts of trips around the aquarium which has now reopened after the pandemic closed down for months.
TONY DOKOUPIL So, I-- I had always heard that one of the things-- I`d always heard that one of the things that makes humans unique in the animal kingdom is our curiosity. And it would appear that those penguins were also pretty curious about everything in the museum.
GAYLE KING: Yeah.
VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: We`ve all want to know what`s going on.
TONY DOKOUPIL: Yeah.
GAYLE KING: Pretty curious and pretty-- pretty curious and pretty cute, and something tells me Anthony`s not watching us this morning. But I`ll bet he appreciates you thinking about him, Vlad. I`m hoping Anthony`s sleeping. That`s what I`m hoping he`s doing.
TONY DOKOUPIL: He`ll be up later. He can scroll on social media and find it.
GAYLE KING: That was nice that included that for him.
VLADIMIR DUTHIERS That`s right.
TONY DOKOUPIL: All right. Ahead, whether schools--
GAYLE KING: We`ll send it to him. We`ll send it to him.
TONY DOKOUPIL: Ahead, whether schools should reopen in the fall. We`ll talk to a former secretary of education. Stay with us.

Hard lessons. President Trump pressures schools to fully reopen while the number of coronavirus cases surges. Plus former education secretary Margaret Spellings, what she would tell parents.
TONY DOKOUPIL: Staying in shape. In our Pushing the Limits series, how athletes and dancers are handling life on the sidelines.
VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: And local hero. One man with a boat saves a remote Alaska community from food shortages during the pandemic.
GAYLE KING: Neighbor helping neighbor.
But first, here`s today`s Eye Opener @8.
The coronavirus and the new concerns that the surge in the cases could lead to critical shortages of urgently needed medical supplies.
MIREYA VILLARREAL: Our crew was invited inside the hospital you see behind me. They are treating more than a hundred and forty COVID patients. They`re actually having to rent beds right now to accommodate for their higher numbers.
TONY DOKOUPIL: The Trump administration is insisting schools fully reopen in the fall, even though many have not met CDC safety guidelines.
PAULA REID: A White House adviser said the President is especially interested in getting kids back to class because it means getting parents back to work.
VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Breaking overnight, former Glee actress Naya Rivera is missing in California. A search for Rivera resumed this morning in Lake Piru, where she was boating with her four-year-old son.
MAN #1: This dad is basically playing refrigerator whack-a-mole except with his--
MAN #2: Oh, my.
MAN #1: --triplet toddlers. These guys are absolutely relentless. He needs to be playing--
MAN #2: Wow.
MAN #1: --zone instead of man to man.
WOMAN: Oh.
MAN #2: Oh.
WOMAN: Watch the head.
MAN #1: And he`s getting killed. The precision moves, the constant attack.
MAN #2: Well--
MAN #1: Almost slammed the door there.
MAN #2: Whoever has the camera might have helped him.
MAN #1: The good news is, hey, with the gym closed he got a workout.
GAYLE KING: Welcome back to CBS THIS MORNING. I like the little workout he`s getting in there. They`re so cute.
TONY DOKOUPIL: Very sweet.
GAYLE KING: I love that picture.
VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: They`re adorable. They`re adorable. I love how they keep trying-- whatever`s in that refrigerator has got to be really good, Gayle.
GAYLE KING: Yes. I hadn`t thought about that. I was so busy looking at them. But you`re right. What`s in that refrigerator?
We`re going to begin with this, there are now more than three million cases of the coronavirus in this country. Despite the surge, the Trump administration is pressuring schools to fully reopen this fall.
BETSY DEVOS (Secretary of Education): Ultimately, it`s not a matter of if schools should reopen, it`s simply a matter of how. They must fully open, and they must be fully operational.
GAYLE KING: The CDC is expected to issue new guidance next week on how schools should reopen. Now this comes after President Trump slammed the agency on Twitter, calling its current guidelines ""expensive"" and ""impractical.""
TONY DOKOUPIL: Mister Trump also threatened to pull funding from schools that stay closed. Now we spoke to some teachers who say they are concerned about the effectiveness of remote learning, but they are also worried about safety.
WOMAN #1: I worry about, you know, teachers that are immune-compromised or live with somebody that`s immune-compromised. I worry that if we can`t provide in-person instruction that some of my students will be so incredibly behind.
WOMAN #2: I think that while considering things like their social and emotional growth are incredibly important, my students can`t learn if they`re sick and I can`t teach them if I`m dead.
TONY DOKOUPIL: Important to keep in mind that ultimately it is up to states to decide whether schools should reopen, not President Trump."

The origins of Pride Month, a celebration of LGBTQIA+ rights, can be traced back to the June 1969 Stonewall Uprising in New York City. 
Kelsey Welsh '22, said these two coinciding rights movements provide an opportunity to discuss anti-Black racism in the LGBT community. Welsh said the important roles of Black activists in the then-LGBT community have been excluded from the larger Pride movement. 
""A Black trans woman was at the very front of that movement. She was known in my whole community, and yet her name [was] just kind of got forgotten,"" Welsh said. ""It definitely feels [like] the LGBT movement, and Pride in general, has always had a really big problem with intersectionality.""
The Black transgender woman ""at the front"" was Marsha P. Johnson, a prominent figure in the Stonewall Uprising which began as a series of demonstrations led by transgender women of color after a police raid on the Stonewall Inn, a gay club in Greenwich Village in Manhattan. The Stonewall Uprising gave forward momentum to the fight for LGBT rights. Five decades later, Black trans women are still prominent in the struggle against racism, homophobia and transphobia. 
""Black queer people have always been at the front of a lot of these movements that we're seeing,"" Welsh said. ""My experience as a Black woman is always going to be shaped by the fact that I am also bisexual, and vice versa."" 
Eternity Philops, owner of Soul Liberation Wellness, a wellness business that offers a safe space for the Black LGBT community to heal and practice self-care, wrote that the mainstream, or white, LGBT community ""often forget, or perhaps choose to ignore, that the Stonewall Riots began with queer [people of color] and trans women of color."" 
""The civil rights that many white LGBTQ folks enjoy now came on the backs of [queer and trans people of color ], and yet QTPOC continue to be racially marginalized in LGBTQ spaces,"" Philops wrote in an email to The Hawk. ""This shows just how pervasive racism and white privilege is among the white LGBTQ.""
Earl D. Fowlkes, president of the Center for Black Equity, a multinational organization that aims to provide support and resources for people who identify as Black and LGBT, said he personally experienced racism from Philadelphia's white LGBT community. 
""Until recently many of the bars did not welcome Black and Brown people in the gay bars,"" Fowlkes said. ""I remember having to show two IDs to get into bars, so I got a passport, not to travel around the world, but to be able to have a driver's license and a passport to get into some of the bars that would have barred me from getting in [without them].""
Fowlkes said resistance to diversity and inclusion in the LGBT movement forces individuals with diverse intersecting identities to create safe spaces of their own. 
""Sometimes people get tired of fighting for diversity within the existing power structure,"" Fowlkes said. ""Philadelphia Pride does not always provide a safe space for Black queer people to be authentically who they are. [At Philadelphia's Black Pride] they don't have to pretend they're less gay or pretend they're less Black, but they can embrace both cultural parts of who they are.""
The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Program's annual report indicates that over 70% of hate-crime victims targeted for their sexual orientation and gender identity and expression were people of color. According to the report, trans people of color are also almost 2.5 times more likely to experience discrimination than their white counterparts.
Fowlkes said identifying as Black and part of the LGBT community is a ""double whammy"" of marginalization. 
""In many cases, we're dealing with racism in the white gay community,"" Fowlkes said. ""And we're dealing with homophobia, transphobia in the Black community."" 
Discussions of racial and LGBT equality often treat the two struggles as separate entities, ignoring the experiences of LGBT people of color, wrote Imani Briscoe '17, experiential programmer for the Center for Inclusion and Diversity, in an email to The Hawk.
""This constant separation causes real harm to LGBTQIA+ people of color as they are often times disproportionately targeted by acts of discrimination and further marginalized in their needs due to the layered exposure to anti-gay and/or anti-transgender policies and institutionalized racial discrimination that is woven into the very fabric of society,"" Briscoe wrote. 
Nicole R. Stokes, Ph.D., associate provost for diversity, equity & inclusion, said having a space to discuss the intersectionality between gender, sexual orientation, race and other diverse identities is essential to creating an inclusive campus. 
""They may not feel any marginalization in just one of those domains, it might be that crescendo or that bringing together all of those parts of their identity, where they're feeling a sense of not belonging,"" Stokes said. ""I do think it's really important for a majority of members of our community to really understand that it's not so one dimensional."" 
Welsh said she encourages others to start having this conversation ""among your own circles"" to combat homophobia. 
""The simple act of just kind of reaching out to queer people in our life and just asking them directly, 'How can I better support you in the community?'"" Welsh said. ""It's very simple, but a lot of people overlook that really small acts can go a really long way."" "

Many viewers, including Asian-American celebrities such as writer Jenny Yang, derided Patel's methods for departing from how Chinese egg-fried rice is traditionally made.

Rice is a staple ingredient in Asia, and has been adopted by cuisines globally since it was first domesticated in China more than 9,400 years ago, according to Chinese researchers. There are countless ways to prepare rice -- you can steam it, fry it, simmer it slowly in broth like Italian risotto or scorch it to develop a crispy crust like Iranian tahdig.
But the issue at hand goes beyond a difference in opinion on the varying methods of cooking rice.
The controversy over the BBC Food clip, and the reaction it provoked within certain Asian communities, speaks to a broader, long-standing debate about the intersection of food, ethnicity and culture -- the fundamental question of who is allowed to cook what food.
Appropriating and whitewashing food
Countless White chefs in recent years have been accused of cultural appropriation by creating food from other ethnic groups using methods and phrases that are deemed ""unauthentic,"" disrespectful, and sometimes outright racist.
Last year, for instance, an Asian food critic accused celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay of tokenism, after he launched a restaurant described in promotional material as ""an authentic Asian eating house.""
The restaurant didn't differentiate between wildly different and unique types of Asian cuisines, lumping them all together as generically Asian. And at the time of the opening, it did not appear to have any Asian chefs.
""Japanese? Chinese? It's all Asian, who cares,"" wrote the critic, Angela Hui, in a scathing Instagram story.
CNN reached out to Ramsay's restaurant group for comment after the initial controversy.
Tokenism is when racial, ethnic, or cultural diversity is emphasized only on a symbolic level, without much substantial effort to understand that culture -- in Ramsay's case, labeling a restaurant ""Asian"" without taking the time to differentiate between these individual nuanced cuisines.
Food is not just sustenance, it carries history and heritage, which is why many people are deeply offended when these traditional methods of cooking are cast aside.
Sometimes chefs don't just change up cooking methods, they blatantly insult the cuisine and culture of origin.
One notorious example is the Chinese-inspired restaurant Lucky Lee's in New York. When it opened in 2019, the White owner said it would serve ""clean"" food that wouldn't make people feel ""bloated and icky"" afterwards -- the implication being that regular Chinese food was somehow unhealthy. That sparked uproar and the restaurant closed eight months later.
And then there are chefs who fail to acknowledge a dish's ethnic origins at all -- the equivalent of whitewashing food.
The New York Times food columnist Alison Roman, also a White woman, gained internet fame for her recipe for a ""Spiced Chickpea Stew with Coconut and Turmeric"" -- which sounds an awful lot like an Indian or Jamaican curry. But in an interview with Jezebel, she said: ""I'm like y'all, this is not a curry ... I've never made a curry."" Roman's refusal to call it a curry and her denial of its ethnic background prompted critic Roxana Hadadi to call it ""colonialism as cuisine.""
In response to the backlash, NYT eventually added a line in Roman's recipe on their website, saying it ""evokes stews found in South India and parts of the Caribbean.""
But some people have pushed back against the idea of cultural appropriation.
Gatekeeping food prevents innovation, some say: for instance, fusion foods are born from chefs experimenting with different cuisines. Many also point out that food is meant to be shared, and its power is often directly tied to the communal eating experience.
Setting boundaries around food -- for example, saying only Chinese people can cook Chinese food, or Chinese food can only be cooked a certain way, as those reacting to Ng's video posit -- seems like the antithesis of this sharing spirit in our globalized world.
But sharing is different from appropriating without respect, especially when the chefs who do it profit from portraying those foods.
A reckoning in food media
The Uncle Roger video is the latest in a string of incidents that have drawn attention to issues surrounding food and culture. This summer has seen the reckoning on race and racism, embodied by the Black Lives Matter movement, spread from the streets to newsrooms and companies.
Within food media, Bon Appetit -- owned by Conde Nast -- is the best-known example. Current staffers, including assistant food editor Sohla El-Waylly, accused the company of underpaying and exploiting employees of color, and viewers called out the brand for numerous instances of food appropriation.
For instance, irate viewers pointed to the time Bon Appetit had a White chef demonstrate how to cook Vietnamese pho, with the title ""PSA: This Is How You Should Be Eating Pho."" There was also the time they ""reinvented"" the Filipino dessert Halo-halo by stuffing it with gummy bears and popcorn, spurring scorn from readers.
Each time, the brand would issue an apology and a promise to do better -- but it has been happening for years.
After this summer's explosive allegations, the company released a statement in June, acknowledging that ""BA's recipes for Vietnamese pho, mumbo sauce, flaky bread, and White-guy kimchi all erased these recipes' origins or, worse, lampooned them.""
""In all these cases and more, BA has been called out for appropriation, for decontextualizing recipes from non-White cultures, and for knighting 'experts' without considering if that person should, in fact, claim mastery of a cuisine that isn't theirs,"" wrote Joey Hernandez, BA's research director, in the statement.
The Bon Appetit debacle also prompted other questions about biases within established institutions. Who chooses what dishes get more coverage? Why do publications continue to use language that frames ""ethnic"" food as occasionally bizarre and often incomprehensible -- for example, Bloomberg calling tofu a ""white, chewy and bland"" food people are ""learning to love?"" Bloomberg eventually removed these phrases from their article after international backlash.
And why are ""ethnic"" chefs -- a euphemism for non-Whites -- often paid less? Bon Appetit fans were further outraged when Somali chef Hawa Hassan revealed last month that she was only paid $400 per video, and El-Waylly blasted Bon Appetit for only paying her $50,000 to ""assist mostly white editors with significantly less experience than me.""
These themes sound abstract at times -- but they're linked to and help perpetuate broader real-life inequalities such as workplace discrimination, pay inequity, power imbalances and prevailing Whiteness in the food world.
Ng and Patel may not have intended for their respective videos, and upcoming collaboration, to raise these questions.
But viewers' frustrations are inherently tied to the idea that there is an authentic way to cook fried rice, and that Patel's errors are made worse by the fact she is a non-Chinese chef presenting herself as an authority on the dish.
""FOR ANYONE WHO IS TRYING TO SAY THERE ARE MULTIPLE WAYS OF COOKING RICE, WELL OF COURSE THERE ARE. AND I LOVE THEM ALL,"" tweeted Yang, the Asian American writer. ""BUT THIS IS *NOT* HOW YOU MAKE DELICIOUS FRIED RICE, THE DISH OF MY PEOPLES, THE SUBJECT OF THIS VIDEO."""

(EFE).- Burnt American flags and the downing of a statue of Christopher Columbus in Baltimore were some of the scenes that were experienced in recent hours in protests in different parts of the U.S., following President Donald Trump's speech.
On the occasion of July 4, he had called several anti-racist demonstrations and to call for the departure of Trump and his vice president, Mike Pence, in several US cities. The U.S. ended flag burning in Washington DC, Los Angeles, Chicago and New York, according to one of the organizers, the Revolutionary Communist Party.
In the case of the capital, participants set fire to the flag next to Lafayette Square, the park next to the White House to the cry of ""America was never great,"" which contrasts with Trump's campaign slogan ""Make America Big Again.""
In the U.S., the burning of the national flag is not illegal, and in fact at the Hollywood protest was 63-year-old activist Gregory ""Joey"" Johnson, who in 1989 won the case before the Supreme Court that recognized his right to burn the teaching.
Johnson set fire to three flags, the Confederate (representing southern states and southern slavers during the Civil War), the American one and the Blue Lives Matter movement, to protest Trump.
Blue Lives Matter, as opposed to the Black Lives Matter group, which protests police violence against African-Americans, advocates that those convicted of the killing of police officers be convicted of hate crimes.
Meanwhile, in Baltimore, Maryland, a group of protesters last night shot down the statue of Christopher Colon located in the Little Italy area and dumped it in the water at Inner Harbor, CNN's television network reported on Sunday.
One witness pointed to the canal that after knocking it down with a rope, the statue broke into pieces that were dragged by protesters into the water.
These events came after U.S. President Donald Trump delivered a harsh speech at the White House for the Fourth of July, on Independence Day, in which he sought polarization.
In his at the same time, the president stated: ""We are now in the process of defeating the radical left, the Marxists, the anarchists, the agitators, the looters and the people, who in many instances do not know at all what he is doing.""
He also said they will never allow ""an angry crowd"" to erase the country's history and tear down monuments.
This speech was similar to the previous day delivered on Mount Rushmore in South Dakota, where the faces of Presidents George Washington (1789–1797), Thomas Jefferson (1801–1809), Abraham Lincoln (1861–1865) and Theodore Roosevelt (1901-1909) are sculpted.
There Trump also exploited social divisions, alerted the ""cultural revolution of the left wing"" and announced the creation of a ""National Garden of American Heroes,"" with monuments to historical characters, to respond to attacks on statues.
In recent weeks, attacks on monuments of Confederate leaders, founding fathers of the United States and explorers linked to the Spanish ""conquest"" of America, such as Christopher Columbus, have multiplied, which are perceived as symbols of racism by protesters.
These attacks have occurred in the heat of racial protests unleashed after the death in late May of a black man, George Floyd, at the hands of a white policeman in Minneapolis, Minesota."

NEW YORK, July 14, 2020 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Today, Candid releasedPhilanthropy for a Safe, Healthy, and Just World, a first-of-its-kind study that identifies clear opportunities and challenges in supporting peacebuilding activities. Currently, less than 1% of philanthropic funding supports peace and security. 823 organizations worldwide responded to a survey, conducted by Candid and CENTRIS and funded by PeaceNexus, which formed the basis of the study. The study sheds light on what motivates civil society organizations to support—and not support—peace-related work, addresses common misconceptions about peacebuilding, and suggests concrete recommendations to enable greater involvement and investment.
Lauren Bradford, senior director of global partnerships at Candid, said, ""This study starts to answer foundational questions for the sector. What we've learned from those doing peacebuilding work is that effective approaches are grounded in the intersection of social justice, human rights, and peace, and carefully considers dynamics that stand in the way of achieving a more peaceful society.""
Key findings from the report include:
Non-governmental organizations/civil society organizations are the most active in peacebuilding, while endowed philanthropy is the least active. The two most powerful predictors of commitment to peace are organizations' experience working in a conflict zone and commitment to political change. Given a list of social change priorities, survey respondents ranked conflict transformation and peacebuilding last. Yet, more than half of respondents said that supporting resilience and stable societies—a key component of peacebuilding—is either important or central to their work. Respondents are more likely to see their work through a lens of social justice or human rights than through that of peace and security. Reasons for why organizations are not engaged in peacebuilding include: it's too political (43.2%); there's not enough evidence for what works (24.3%); it's too difficult to measure (24.3%); and it's for government and official donors, not for private foundations or civil society (18.3%). Respondents tend to see peacebuilding as primarily relevant in areas affected by war or violent conflict. However, conflict-related issues such as racial and ethnic animosity and hate crimes, mass shootings and gun violence, economic inequality, and gender inequality underscore why peacebuilding is needed in every region of the world. 
CENTRIS executive director Barry Knight said, ""The study shows what practitioners have been saying for years, namely that peacebuilding at community level is invisible to grantmaking foundations. At a time when the world needs so much healing, we hope that the study will show why a new approach is needed.""
Peace and security are global issues with relevance to every community. Philanthropy for a Safe, Healthy, and Just World will help philanthropy and civil society organizations shift perceptions, improve strategies, and prioritize preventing conflict and building peace locally and globally.

148,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1251/Files (250).DOCX","The Associated Press",2020-06-11,"916 words","POLITICAL NEWS","LISA MASCARO, AP Congressional Correspondent",NA,"Senate GOP readies policing bill after Floyd death, protests",FALSE,"WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans are narrowing on a package of proposed policing changes after George Floyd's death that would create a national database of use-of-force incidents, boost the use of police body cameras and include long-stalled effort to make lynching a federal hate crime.
The emerging bill doesn't go as far as a sweeping Democratic package unveiled this week. But the sudden burst of political energy reflects how quickly the national conversation over police and racial injustice is upturning business as usual in Washington. The GOP package includes several provisions similar to the Democratic bill.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, whose home state of Kentucky faces unrest over the police shooting of Breonna Taylor, indicated Thursday the legislation would be ready soon.
“The killing of black Americans like George Floyd and Breonna Taylor have accelerated important conversations,” McConnell said as he opened the Senate.
The party that has long favored a “law and order” approach — seen in President Donald Trump's reaction to the nationwide demonstrations over Floyd's death — finds itself trying to adapt to a fast-changing national dialogue on police and race as the Black Lives Matter movement gains worldwide prominence.
""This is an issue whose time has come,"" said Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., the GOP's only black senator, Thursday on the “Today” show.
A working group of GOP senators led by Scott is meeting behind closed doors and with the White House on the legislation. Despite a push to produce a package this week, the deadline is slipping as details are being compiled. It is expected to be released early next week, according to a senior GOP aide unauthorized to discuss the situation and granted anonymity.
Central to the package will be a new national database of use-of-force incidents, similar to one included in the Democratic bill. It's a concept both parties support as a way to track potential police misconduct and ensure officers cannot simply transfer from one department to another without public disclosure of their records.
Scott said the provision would be named the “Breonna Taylor Reporting Act” and it would include not only the tracking of use-of-force incidents but also no-knock warrants as police used to enter the 26-year-old woman's home. The database proposal expands on a similar bill Scott introduced in 2015 after Walter Scott — no relation — was killed by police in South Carolina.
Unlike the House Democratic bill, which would ban police choke holds, the Republican bill appears to be more focused on providing training for officers to de-escalate confrontations.
It would also include “duty to intervene” provisions so other officers would step up to stop misconduct, Scott said.
“We're trying to provide the resources necessary to retrain these local departments,” he said.
One area of uncertainty is over so-called “qualified immunity” which the Democrats' bill adjusts to make it easier for injured individuals to claim damages in civil suits against police offices. The White House has said it was a nonstarter and is not likely to be included in the Senate bill.
Agreement, though, is quickly forming around the anti-lynching bill, a long-stalled effort that has previously been approved by both the House and Senate but was being held last week up by objections from a lone Republican, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky.
Paul has pushed instead for other measures including changes to no-knock warrants and an end to the practice of sending surplus military equipment to local police departments. Both those are included in the Democrats' bill, but not likely to be included in the Senate GOP package.
Democrats have so far panned the GOP effort as insufficient compared to their own far-reaching proposal, built from decades of work by the Congressional Black Caucus tracking police and racial issues. The House is expected to approve the Democrats' bill mid-June.
“The moment does not call for cherry-picking one or two things to do. It calls for bold and broad-scale change,” said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York.
Schumer has compared this moment in the aftermath of Floyd's death to the GOP approach to gun violence legislation after mass shootings, when lawmakers try to find consensus but end up doing nothing.
“We cannot go through those same motions again,” he said. “This is about the original sin of America, that we must try to deal with head-on.”
In the House, the GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California signaled a willingness to engage on the issue.
“I think there’s a lot of concepts that we agree upon,"" McCarthy told reporters.
McCarthy said he favored a ban on choke holds.
It was a changed tone for Republicans who spent the past several days criticizing activists' calls to defund the police — an overarching term to describe the range of options, from dismantling departments to shifting resources to other mental health and other community services. The Democratic bill does not include efforts to defund the police. It provides grant money to departments that want to consider new ways of policing.
The White House has dispatched top aides to work with Senate Republicans and Trump's views on any final deal will remain key to its support.
McConnell said the Senate is “preparing to add to the conversations surrounding law enforcement with our own serious proposal. The policies would “take smart steps without attacking the vast majority of police officers who bravely do their jobs the right way,” he said."

In June 2011, a Black transgender woman named CeCe McDonald[3] was walking with friends to a grocery store in her Minneapolis neighborhood when a group of white bar patrons began hurling racist, homophobic, and transphobic slurs, calling them[4] 'bitches with dicks,' 'faggots,' and suggesting they 'go back to Africa.' A white woman in the group became physically violent[5], throwing a glass at McDonald's face that sliced open[6] her salivary gland, requiring 11 stitches. When a male attacker lunged at her as she attempted to flee, McDonald, fearing for her life, grabbed a pair of scissors from her purse to defend herself, fatally stabbing her assailant in the chest. Despite a clear claim to self-defense, McDonald was the only person arrested at the scene. A Minneapolis court—after ruling her white male attacker's swastika tattoo, meth intoxication, and assault rap sheet inadmissible—convicted her on a reduced charge of second-degree manslaughter and sentenced her to 41 months in a prison for men. Amid the worldwide outcry over criminal justice abuses against Black lives, it's worth recalling that the same police department and prosecutor's office that dragged their feet on arresting and charging George Floyd's white police officer murderer acted swiftly in their punishment of a Black transgender woman who had defended her own life. Ad Policy[7] Multiple studies demonstrate the outsize damage done by racist and transphobic policing. While a quarter of white trans and gender-nonconforming people report being treated disrespectfully during interactions with police, that figure skyrockets to 47 percent among Black trans and gender-nonconforming people, according to a 2011 report[8] by the National Center for Transgender Equality. Across the board, 22 percent of trans and gender-nonconforming people report law enforcement harassment, versus 38 percent for those who are Black. (One 2008 report[9] noted that Black and Latinx trans women had a name for their constant police profiling as sex workers: 'walking while trans.') Six percent of trans and gender-nonconforming people overall report physical abuse by police, and 2 percent report sexual abuse by them. Those numbers climb to 15 percent and 7 percent, respectively, among Black trans and gender-nonconforming people. As in Floyd's case, McDonald's treatment by the cops and the courts reveals a problem that lies not just with the Minneapolis Police Department but with the American criminal justice system. While trans and gender-nonconforming people are arrested at disproportionate rates to cisgender people, transphobic and racist policing has resulted in nearly half[10]—47 percent—of Black trans and gender-nonconforming people spending time behind bars. After arrest, trans people are particularly susceptible to various forms of violence because they are often placed in facilities based on their gender assignment instead of their gender identity. Nearly one-third[11] of Black trans and gender-nonconforming people who have spent any time in jail or prison report being physically assaulted there, and 32 percent report being sexually abused in custody. Because of biases in sentencing, while just 2 percent[12] of white trans and gender-nonconforming people have served five or more years behind bars, 10 percent of Black trans and gender-nonconforming people have been incarcerated for five to 10 years. Five percent remained in prison for a decade or more. There are many more stories like McDonald's. In 2006, Mariah Lopez[13], a Black Latinx trans woman, reported that New York City police officers sexually and physically assaulted and humiliated her, then jailed her with male inmates whose physical attacks left her with 'broken cartilage in her nose, a broken tooth, and abrasions and bruises to her face and body,' according to an Amnesty International[14] report. A 2019 video of cops in Kansas City, Mo., arresting Breona Hill[15], a Black trans woman, shows them slamming her head into the concrete twice before kneeling on her head and neck 'in contrast to the officers' statements,' according to the local prosecutor. Layleen Xtravaganza Cubilette-Polanco[16], another Black trans woman from New York City, died last year in solitary confinement at Rikers Island, where she was being held on misdemeanor charges. Video shows that as she lay unresponsive in her cell, officers stood outside the door laughing before seeking medical assistance that might have saved her life. And on May 27—two days after Floyd's killing—a Black trans man named Tony McDade[17] was fatally shot by Florida police who repeatedly misgendered him in subsequent reports. https://www.thenation.com/authors/kali-holloway/ MORE FROM Kali Holloway[18] In its conspicuous disregard for the safety of Black trans and gender-nonconforming people, the criminal justice system is complicit in an epidemic of violence that has seen at least 21 trans or gender-nonconforming people killed in the United States[19] this year alone. Those deaths occurred against a backdrop of the Trump administration's unstinting assault on transgender rights. There are also long-standing disparities in areas like employment and housing, undergirded by anti-trans and anti-Black discrimination. Even before the coronavirus crisis, Black trans folks[20] were twice as likely to be unemployed as Black cis people, 38 percent were living below the poverty line, and 42 percent had experienced homelessness at some point. Those numbers have likely worsened during the pandemic. It's critical that the fallout from racist and transphobic policing receive greater attention—and that conversations around defunding bloated police budgets and reinvesting in communities highlight how that money can benefit Black trans and gender-nonconforming folks. More attention has been given to those issues of late, as with the Brooklyn Liberation march last month, which drew 15,000 people,[21] and the recent[22] Queer Liberation March for Black Lives and Against Police Brutality. But emphasizing the particular devastation that policing does to Black trans lives and the focus on mitigating those issues should be consistently front and center. We're at a crucial moment in which all Black lives need recognition. And erasure, we should remember, is yet another form of violence.

Nadler Issues Remarks at Markup of George Floyd Justice in Policing Act",FALSE,"Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-New York, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, issued the following opening remarks during the markup of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act (H.R. 7120) on June 17:
""Last week, George Floyd's brother, Philonise, sat in this room and he told us of the pain he felt watching the video of his brother being killed by a Minneapolis police officer. He gave voice to the pain that all of us have felt over the last few weeks. He also spoke to the anger of knowing that George Floyd was only the latest in a much-too-long list of victims of police brutality--disproportionately people of color. He spoke to the frustration that, time and again, in the face of overwhelming evidence that dramatic reform is needed, Congress has done very little.
""Mr. Floyd charged us with making sure that his brother's death would not be in vain, and he pleaded with us to turn this pain and anger that we all feel into meaningful change. His words echoed the voices of millions of Americans who have taken to the streets in the last few weeks to demand justice and to demand action.
""Today we answer their call.
""We value and respect the many brave and honorable police officers who put their lives on the line every day to protect us and our communities. Those of us who were here in 1998 will never forget the courageous actions and ultimate sacrifice that Capitol Police Officer Jacob Chestnut and Detective John Gibson made in this building while protecting others. We owe them, and the other officers killed in the line of duty each year, a debt that we can never repay. And that includes Officer Patrick Underwood, who was shot and killed in the line of duty several weeks ago.
""But we must acknowledge that too many law enforcement officers do not uphold the ethic of protecting and serving their community. Instead, the reality for too many Americans, especially many African Americans, is that police officers are perceived as a threat to their liberties, to their dignity, and--too often--to their safety.
""This is not a new problem. Centuries of systemic and structural racism has infected all of our institutions. We see it in the rates of COVID deaths, in our system of mass incarceration, and in the vast chasm of economic inequality--all of which fall disproportionately on the backs of African Americans--and we see it in the harassment and excessive force that people of color routinely face by too many of our police officers.
""An unmistakable message has been sent to African Americans in this country: that they are second class citizens, and that their lives are somehow of less value. Well, let me state--clearly and unequivocally--that Black Lives Matter. George Floyd mattered. Breonna Taylor mattered. Eric Garner, Amadou Diallo, Tamir Rice, Walter Scott, and LaQuan McDonald mattered. Rayshard Brooks mattered. And the countless other people who have lost their lives at the hands of law enforcement mattered.
""For far too long, pleas for justice and reform have fallen on deaf ears in Congress. But that changes today.
""The Justice in Policing Act would finally allow for meaningful accountability in cases of police misconduct and it would begin the process of reimagining policing in the 21st Century. This legislation, which currently has 227 cosponsors in the House and 36 cosponsors in the Senate, makes it easier for the federal government to successfully prosecute police misconduct cases, bans chokeholds, ends racial and religious profiling, encourages prosecutions independent from local police, and eliminates the dubious court-made doctrine of qualified immunity in civil rights lawsuits against law enforcement officers.
""At the same time, it addresses systemic racism and works to prevent police violence and bias through a series of 'front-end' approaches aimed at encouraging departments to meet a gold standard in training, hiring, de-escalation strategies, bystander duty, and use of body cameras and other best practices. The goal of this legislation is to achieve a 'guardian, not warrior' model of policing.
""The bill also collects and makes public data on a number of key policing matters, including a first-ever national database on police-misconduct incidents to prevent the movement of dangerous officers from department to department, it ends no-knock warrants and the militarization of local policing, and it specifies that lynching is a federal hate crime.
""The bill does all of this by using no new federal funds for police departments, except where constitutionally mandated for data collection, and it conditions all repurposed, existing funding for the support of these programs.
""It also creates a new grant program for community-based organizations to create local commissions and task forces on policing innovation to reimagine how public safety could work in a truly equitable and just way in each community.
""I want to thank the Gentlelady from California, Ms. Bass, the Chair of the Crime Subcommittee and the sponsor of this legislation, for her tremendous work in crafting a bill that is, at once, bold and transformative to meet the moment that calls out for sweeping reform, while also taking a responsible and balanced approach to the many complicated issues associated with policing. In addition, I want to thank the many Members of this Committee who have worked on and introduced legislation that is included in the legislation before us today.
""I also want to thank the activists who are leading protests across the country. It is because of you that we are here today, considering the most significant reforms to policing in a generation. It is because of your energy, your determination, and your demands for justice that the nation has awakened to the need for action.
""To the families of those who have lost their lives at the hands of law enforcement: everyone in this room mourns with you. But, today, we will offer more than just sympathy. Today we are proposing meaningful change. Thoughts and prayers are not enough. Pledges to study the problem are not enough. Half-measures are not enough.
""To the Members of this Committee, the Justice in Policing Act is our opportunity to show the world that we are listening and that we will respond with real and lasting reforms. We must not let this moment slip away.
""If we find ourselves here again, listening to the heartbreaking testimony of another grieving family member, wondering why we did not act when we had the chance, it will be a stain on our legacy. We must not let that happen.
""I urge all of my colleagues to support this vital legislation.""

Mr Floyd was memorialised in his hometown of Houston, Texas, with 2,500 people attending a service to remember him before he was laid to rest next to his mother.
Joe Biden, the Democrat's presidential nominee, gave a video address during the funeralin which he said ""now is the time for racial justice"".
The service followed two weeks of protests ignited by graphic video footage of Mr Floyd, 46, handcuffed and lying face down on a Minneapolis street while an officer kneels into the back of his neck for nearly nine minutes. The distressing video showed Mr Floyd gasping for air as he cried out for his mother and groans, ""please, I can't breathe,"" before falling silent and still.
The officer, Derek Chauvin, 44, has since been charged with second-degree murder and three other officers with aiding and abetting Mr Floyd's May 25 death.
""I can breathe. And as long as I'm breathing, justice will be served,"" Mr Floyd's niece Brooke Williams declared in a eulogy that drew applause from mourners inside the Fountain of Praise Church in Houston. ""This is not just a murder but a hate crime.""
His niece was one of several relatives and friends, most dressed all in white, who addressed the service, remembering Mr Floyd as a loving, larger-than-life personality at the memorial which was punctuated by gospel music and a video montage of shared memories of the man affectionately known as ""Big Floyd.""
His younger brother, Terrence Floyd, spoke about awakening in the middle of the night in recent days traumatised by the memory of seeing his older sibling calling out for their mother as he lay dying. Another brother, Philonise, sobbing in grief, told mourners: ""George was my personal superman.""
Following the memorial service, Mr Floyd's casket made its way to his final resting place in Houston, where he grew up. Many people waited outside of the Fountain of Praise church, where the service was held, in order to see his casket and accompany it to his cemetery plot.
He was to be buried next to his mother.
Taking the stage to deliver the main eulogy, the Reverend Al Sharpton, a prominent civil rights activist and television commentator, called Mr Floyd ""an ordinary brother"" who left behind a legacy of greatness.
""God took the rejected stone and made him the cornerstone of a movement that is going to change the whole wide world,"" Rev Sharpton said.
He added that the Floyd family would lead a march on Washington being organised for August 28 to mark the 57th anniversary of the 1963 ""I Have a Dream"" speech given from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial by slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr, who was assassinated in 1968.
Some 2,500 people attended the funeral, which followed memorial services last week in Minneapolis, where Mr Floyd made his home after leaving Houston, and Raeford, the North Carolina town where he was born. More than 6,000 people filed past Floyd's open casket on Tuesday as he lay in repose inside the church.
American flags lined the streets outside the church. Flowers and bouquets were placed around a photograph of Mr Floyd.
Former Vice President Mr Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate in the November 3 election, addressed the service via a video recording, lamenting that ""too many black Americans wake up knowing that they could lose their life in the course of just living their life.""
""We must not turn away. We cannot leave this moment thinking we can once again turn away from racism,"" he said. Two voter registration tables were set up outside the church.
Among those in attendance were loved ones of several other black men killed by white police officers or white civilians.
The mother of Eric Garner, the New York man who died in a police chokehold in 2014, was present, as was the family of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Georgia man who was shot and killed in February while jogging. Three white men were charged over his death.
But it was the chillingly graphic video rendering of Mr Floyd's death that triggered an outpouring of rage like no other such killing in recent memory, reinvigorating the Black Lives Matter movement and thrusting demands for racial justice to the top of the political agenda in the US and around the world.
 Fallout from Mr Floyd's death, and reaction to a spate of arson and looting that accompanied some of the otherwise mostly peaceful protests, also plunged President Donald Trump into one of the biggest crises of his tenure.
A Republican, Trump repeatedly threatened to order the military onto the streets to quell protests, focusing on restoring order while saying little about the US racial wounds at the root of the upheavals.
In his eulogy, Rev Sharpton criticised President Trump for his silence on the issues behind police violence.
He said: ""How are you going to scare a bad cop if bad cops don't go to jail? Who taught these cops that they can do this to George?
""When they have the highest level of government that excuses it. When some kids wrongly start violence that this family don't condone and none of us do, the president talks about bringing in the military. But he has not said one word of 8 minutes and 46 seconds of police murder against George Floyd."""
152,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1251/Files (250).DOCX","RTE News",2020-06-09,"518 words","NEWS",NA,NA,"George Floyd laid to rest but calls for change live on",FALSE,"Dressed in white, George Floyd's loved ones gathered at the Fountain of Praise Church in Houston, Texas for his funeral.
They were joined by hundreds of mourners and many more watching on TV to say goodbye to a man whose killing has led to an unprecedented movement across America. 
There were emotional tributes from George Floyd's family members, like his niece Brooke Williams.
""Why must the system be corrupt and broken? Laws were already put in place for the African American system to fail,"" she said. ""These laws need to be changed.""
""No more hate crimes, please. Someone said, 'Make America great again,' but when has America ever been great?"" she added.
The Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden addressed the funeral by video message and made reference to George Floyd’s six-year-old daughter Gianna.
""I know you have a lot of questions that no child should have to ask, questions that too many black children have had to ask for generations,"" he said. ""Why? Why is Daddy gone?""
George Floyd died after Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for almost nine minutes.
Chauvin appeared in court on Monday charged with second-degree murder and his bail was set at $1.25 million.
George Floyd's killing has sparked a wave of protests across the US and around the world.
The demonstrations were held to highlight police violence but saw fresh cases of heavy-handedness against protesters like an incident in Buffalo, New York when a 75-year-old man was pushed over by police.
The US President Donald Trump has questioned the man's motives tweeting that he may have been an ""ANTIFA provocateur"". 
He suggested that he'd fallen harder than he was pushed and asked if it could have been a set up.
Buffalo protester shoved by Police could be an ANTIFA provocateur. 75 year old Martin Gugino was pushed away after appearing to scan police communications in order to black out the equipment. @OANN I watched, he fell harder than was pushed. Was aiming scanner. Could be a set up?
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 9, 2020
It is not the first time Mr Trump has questioned the motives of protesters. 
He also pushed back against one of their calls, to defund police departments.
The US President has rejected demands to scrap the current policing model and replace it with community-based initiatives.
It is a radical proposal that would be unlikely to meet with widespread public approval. 
Seizing on this, the Trump campaign suggested that Democratic candidate Joe Biden was in favour of defunding police departments, but he insisted this was not the case.
He has however called for major policing reforms. 
With Election 2020 less than five months away, issues of race and policing look set to dominate the political discourse.
Perhaps that will be George Floyd's legacy.
As he lay gasping for air under the knee of a police officer, he cried out for his late mother and will now be buried alongside her.
Campaigners will be hopeful that although the man has been laid to rest, the movement sparked by George Floyd's killing will live on for months and years to come and bring about real change."

It is because of your energy, your determination, and your demands for justice that the nation has awakened to the need for action.
""To the families of those who have lost their lives at the hands of law enforcement: everyone in this room mourns with you. But, today, we will offer more than just sympathy. Today we are proposing meaningful change. Thoughts and prayers are not enough. Pledges to study the problem are not enough. Half-measures are not enough.
""To the Members of this Committee, the Justice in Policing Act is our opportunity to show the world that we are listening and that we will respond with real and lasting reforms. We must not let this moment slip away.
""If we find ourselves here again, listening to the heartbreaking testimony of another grieving family member, wondering why we did not act when we had the chance, it will be a stain on our legacy. We must not let that happen.
""I urge all of my colleagues to support this vital legislation.""

'Black Birders Week' was created this week to celebrate black people who bird
A black birdwatcher in San Francisco has revealed that he once created custom posters to explain what he was doing after white people kept calling 911 to report him as suspicious.
Walter Kitundu, 46, spoke out about his experiences during 'Black Birders Week', which was created in response to a false 911 report against another black bird watcher in Central Park last month.
In 2005, Kitundu spent seven months visiting Alta Plaza Park in San Francisco near daily, observing and photographing a young red-tailed hawk he named Patch.
But day after day, Kitundu says, he kept getting stopped by the police, and even heard other people in the park calling 911 within earshot.
'I didn't have dog. I didn't have a partner. I didn't have a stroller. I didn't really fit into the generalized idea of who the park was for. And I was black in an affluent neighborhood,' Kitundu recalled in an interview with the Washington Post.
'And I was being still for long periods of time. I feel like the white people in the park who called the police were owners of limited imaginations that were stunted by racism. Because I think if I had been a white person in the park with my camera, I would have been given credit that I knew something that they didn't or I must have had a good reason for being there,' he said.
'I got pulled over by the police from a hummingbird bush once. I got stopped by police on two other occasions walking through the park. And then one person had the audacity to call the police on me within earshot,' he continued. 
'I could hear him describing me to the police, and I turned around and I said to him, ""Can I help you?"" And he said, ""The police will take care of you."" So after that incident, that's when I went home and made that sign,' he said.
Kitundu's sign titled 'Advisory!' shows a picture of him, and assures the public that although they may not be accustomed to black bird watchers, there is nothing dangerous about the combination.
'I needed people to know, in terms of trying to secure my safety as I photographed the birds,' he explained. 
'I think as a black person, as a person of color in this country, every time you walk out the door, there's always calculus running in the background about how to present, how to keep yourself safe,' he said. 
'It's a muscle that's well exercised by people of color in this country. I can't really think of anything more wholesome than standing under a tree and watching a hummingbird build her nest, but I think if our activities fall outside of the framework of possibility that's established for us by the white imagination, then we're at risk,' Kitundu added.
Black Birders Week, which started on Sunday and ends on Friday, is intended to promote diversity in outdoor activities and highlight awareness after a shocking racist incident in Central Park.
Amy Cooper was filmed falsely accusing a black birdwatcher of 'threatening her life' in Central Park.
Harvard graduate Christian Cooper, 57, had been bird watching in an area of the park known as The Ramble over the Memorial Day weekend when he encountered Amy Cooper walked her dog unleashed, against park rules.
After pointing out to Cooper that dogs must be leashed in The Ramble at all times to protect wildlife habitats, she quickly became irate, with the 41-year-old hysterically dialing 911, wailing into her cell phone that 'an African American man is threatening my life'.
In the hours that followed the video's emergence, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio branded Cooper as 'racist...pure and simple' as outrage over the incident - commonly referred to as Central Park Karen - rippled out nationwide.
Cooper was terminated from her $170k-per-year role at as head of insurance investment solutions at Franklin Templeton shortly afterwards. A petition to ban her from Central Park for life also emerged, as did new legislation that would make falsely reporting an incident as a hate crime illegal, should it pass.
In a statement, Amy Cooper offered her sincere apologies to Christian Cooper, saying she 'reacted emotionally and made false assumptions about his intentions when, in fact, I was the one who was acting inappropriately by not having my dog on a leash.
'I am well aware of the pain that misassumptions and insensitive statements about race cause and would never have imagined that I would be involved in the type of incident that occurred with Chris. 
'I hope that a few mortifying seconds in a lifetime of forty years will not define me in his eyes and that he will accept my sincere apology.'"

 American flags fluttered along the route to the Fountain of Praise church in Houston, where Floyd grew up, as throngs of mourners wearing face coverings to prevent spread of the coronavirus formed a procession to pay final respects.
 Solemnly filing through the church in two parallel lines, some mourners bowed their heads, others made the sign of the cross or raised a fist, as they paused in front of Floyd's open casket. More than 6,300 people took part in the visitation, which ran for more than six hours, church officials said.
 Fire officials said several people, apparently overcome by heat exhaustion while waiting in line, were taken to hospitals. ""I'm glad he got the send-off he deserved,"" Marcus Williams, a 46-year-old black resident of Houston, said outside the church. ""I want the police killings to stop. I want them to reform the process to achieve justice, and stop the killing.""
 The public viewing came two weeks to the day after Floyd's death was captured by an onlooker's video. As a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, an unarmed and handcuffed Floyd, 46, lay face down on a Minneapolis street, gasping for air and groaning for help, before falling silent.
 The case was reminiscent of the 2014 killing of another African American, Eric Garner, who died after being placed by police in a chokehold while under arrest in New York City.
 The dying words of both men, ""I can't breathe,"" have become a rallying cry in a global outpouring of rage, drawing crowds by the thousands to the streets despite health hazards from the coronavirus pandemic.
 The demonstrations stretched into a third week on Monday.
 ""Even though it is a risk to come out here, I think it has been a very positive experience. You hear the stories, you feel the energy,"" Benedict Chiu, 24, told Reuters at an outdoor memorial service in Los Angeles. ""I'm here to protest the mistreatment of our black bodies. It's not going to stop unless we keep protesting,"" said Erica Corley, 34, one of hundreds attending a gathering in the Washington suburb of Silver Spring, Maryland.
 As the public viewing unfolded in Houston, Derek Chauvin, 44, the police officer who knelt on Floyd's neck and is charged with second-degree murder, made his first court appearance in Minneapolis by video link. A judge ordered his bail raised from $1 million to $1.25 million.
 Chauvin's co-defendants, three fellow officers accused of aiding and abetting Floyd's murder, were previously ordered held on $750,000 to $1 million bond each.
 All four were dismissed from the police department the day after Floyd's death.
 Unleashed amid pent-up anxiety and despair inflicted by a pandemic that has hit minority communities especially hard, the demonstrations have reinvigorated the Black Lives Matter movement and thrust demands for racial justice and police reforms to the top of America's political agenda ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election.
 Protests in a number of US cities were initially punctuated by episodes of arson, looting and clashes with police, deepening a political crisis for President Donald Trump as he repeatedly threatened to order the military into the streets to help restore order.
 Police 'defunding' stirs controversy Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, who is challenging the Republican Trump in the election, met with Floyd's relatives for more than an hour in Houston on Monday, according to the family's lawyer, Benjamin Crump. ""He listened, heard their pain and shared in their woe,"" Crump said. ""That compassion meant the world to this grieving family."" Floyd was due to be buried on Tuesday.
 In Washington, Democrats in Congress unveiled legislation to make lynching a federal hate crime and to allow victims of police misconduct and their families to sue law enforcement for damages in civil court, ending a legal doctrine known as qualified immunity.
 The bill also would ban chokeholds and require the use of body cameras by federal law enforcement officers, place new restrictions on the use of lethal force and facilitate independent probes of police departments that show patterns of misconduct.
 The legislation does not call for police departments to be de-funded or abolished, as some activists have demanded. But lawmakers called for spending priorities to change.
 Trump ""is appalled by the defund-the-police movement,"" White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany told a media briefing. She said Trump was weighing various proposals in response to Floyd's death.
 Biden opposes the movement to defund police departments but supports the ""urgent need"" for reform, a spokesman for his presidential campaign said.
 A high-spirited atmosphere that prevailed over a series of mass demonstrations during the weekend was marred late on Sunday when a man drove a car into a rally in Seattle and then shot and wounded a demonstrator who confronted him. The suspect, Nikolas Fernandez, was charged on Monday with assault.
 Separately, a man described by prosecutors as an admitted member of the Ku Klux Klan and ""propagandist for Confederate ideology,"" was arrested on suspicion of driving his pickup truck into a rally near Richmond, Virginia, late on Sunday. The suspect, Harry H. Rogers, 36, was charged with assault and battery, malicious wounding and felony vandalism."

AMSTERDAM — Vandals have daubed red paint and the word “racist” on a statue of Mohandas Gandhi in Amsterdam, amid a wave of attacks on statues around the world of controversial historical figures.
A worker cleaned the statue Wednesday with a high-pressure water hose. Gandhi, widely lauded for his peaceful campaign to win independence for India, has faced criticism for some of his writings about black Africans.
A lawyer, Gandhi traveled to South Africa in 1893 and stayed for two decades, fighting to expand rights for Indians there. He has faced criticism for referring in his writings to black South Africans as backward. However, he later changed his views and supported the rights of black South Africans.
His nonviolent resistance methods have been used in movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.

DETROIT — A white suburban Detroit police chief has been suspended for 30 days without pay and will undergo diversity training for inappropriate social media posts about people protesting the death of George Floyd.
Trustees in Macomb County’s Shelby Township voted 5-2 on Tuesday night on the punishment for chief Robert J. Shelide, who has held the title since 2015.
Shelide, who earlier apologized, told the township board before the vote that he is “not a racist” and “I bleed blue.”
Shelide had been on administrative leave the past two weeks while officials investigated posts on a now-deleted Twitter account. Screenshots posted on Facebook show one tweet spoke about the need to “unleash real cops” and describing protesters as “barbarians” and needing “body bags.“

Two people were taken by ambulance to a hospital. Another was taken for treatment in a personal car. Police say none of the injuries were life-threatening.

ATLANTA — Georgia’s lieutenant governor is proposing a version of a hate crimes law for the state.
Republican Geoff Duncan called on lawmakers to create a free-standing hate crime and include more categories of bias crimes. Those would involve people victimized because of their culture and their status in exercising First Amendment rights, including worship, free speech, free press, assembly or petition of government.
A previous effort was found unconstitutional by the state Supreme Court more than a decade ago.

GENEVA — The brother of George Floyd has made a heartfelt plea to the U.N.’s top human rights body to launch intense international scrutiny of systemic racism and the killing of unarmed blacks by police.
Philonese Floyd’s message by video to the Human Rights Council came as it contemplates an unprecedented bid sought by the Africa Group to create a Commission of Inquiry — the council’s most powerful tool of scrutiny — to examine and report on racism and violence against protesters by police in the United States.
“I am my brother’s keeper. You in the United Nations are your brothers and sisters’ keepers in America — and you have the power to help us get justice for my brother George Floyd,” Floyd said. “I am asking you to help him. I am asking you to help me. I am asking you to help us: Black people in America.”

HUNTINGTON, W.Va. — The Huntington City Council in West Virginia will vote Wednesday on a proposal to make Juneteenth a permanent city holiday.
The celebration commemorates when enslaved people in Texas learned they were free on June 19, 1865. Huntington Mayor Steve Williams told The Herald-Dispatch he supports the proposal and wants the city’s African American residents to know “the city celebrates Juneteenth with them just as we all celebrate July Fourth together.”
The mayor says the idea for the holiday proposal came from meetings with his diversity advisory committee amid the international protests following the death of George Floyd. Williams expects Wednesday’s meeting will help fast-track the resolution so council members can get it in the books before Friday.
The Emancipation Proclamation was signed by President Abraham Lincoln on Jan. 1, 1863, and freed enslaved people of the rebellion Confederate states.

HOUSTON — Officials say a statue of a Confederate soldier has been removed from a downtown Houston park and a second Confederate statue is expected to be removed soon.
The “Spirit of the Confederacy” statue was removed late Tuesday from Sam Houston Park. Mayor Sylvester Turner said last week the statue will be housed in the Houston Museum of African American Culture.
A second statue, of Confederate artillery commander Richard W. “Dick” Dowling, is also slated for removal. Initially, the Dowling statue was to be moved from Houston’s Hermann Park to the Sabine Pass Battleground State Historical Site near Port Arthur.
But officials say the Dowling statue will instead be placed in a warehouse, at least temporarily, after leaders in Port Arthur expressed opposition.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — A Roman Catholic chaplain at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has resigned at the request of the archdiocese after sending an email suggesting the killing of George Floyd was not an act of racism and he hadn’t lived “a virtuous life.”
The Archdiocese of Boston asked the Rev. Daniel Patrick Moloney to step down June 9 after he sent the message to Catholics at MIT, The Boston Globe reports. A statement from the archdiocese said Moloney’s comments “were wrong and by his resignation he accepts the hurt they have caused.”
The archdiocese learned about the email from Catholics at MIT and alumni. Moloney says he was trying to speak out against “cancel culture” and regrets his message has been misunderstood.
Suzy Nelson, an MIT vice president and dean for student life, sent an email to students calling Moloney’s comments “deeply disturbing” and “Father Moloney’s message failed to acknowledge the dignity of each human being and the devastating impact of systemic racism.”

GENEVA – A U.S. ambassador says the United States is committed to addressing its “shortcomings,” ahead of the U.N. human rights body's discussion of systemic racism and police brutality.
Andrew Bremberg, the U.S. ambassador in Geneva, noted President Donald Trump has condemned the actions of Minneapolis police officers involved in the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man. Trump signed an executive order on police reform on Tuesday.
“The United States recognizes and is committed to addressing its shortcomings, including racial discrimination, and injustices that stem from such discrimination, that persist in our society,” Bremberg said in a statement. “Every democracy faces challenges — the difference is how we deal with them.”
Bremberg says the executive order was “an example of how transparent and responsive our government leaders are in holding violators accountable for their actions and reforming our own system.”
The Human Rights Council in Geneva, following a call by African nations, will discuss “racially inspired human rights violations, systematic racism, police brutality and the violence against peaceful protests.”

NEW ORLEANS — The whereabouts of a statue of a slave owner toppled by protesters in New Orleans and thrown into the Mississippi River remain unknown after a group of men fished the bust out of the water.
A video shows the group using ropes and a plank to carry the paint-splattered bust of John McDonogh out of the river and onto a pickup truck Sunday.
Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s office told The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate the bust is “considered stolen property,” and whoever has it should contact the city regarding its return.
McDonogh left much of his money to New Orleans and Baltimore for schools, and many schools in New Orleans are named after him.
On McDonogh Day each year, schoolchildren from across the city lined up to lay flowers in a racially segregated ceremony. It was boycotted in the 1950s when African-American children would have to wait for hours for white children to lay their flowers first.

RICHMOND, Va. — Demonstrators in Richmond tore down another Confederate statue on Tuesday night.
The Howitzers Monument located near Virginia Commonwealth University’s Monroe Park campus was toppled after protesters spent the night marching in the rain and used a rope to pull it down from its pedestal.
A video from the Richmond Times-Dispatch shows the paint-splattered statue on the ground as the rain continued overnight in Virginia’s capital city.
It’s the third Confederate statue, and the fourth monument, to be torn down in Virginia since international protests erupted following the death of George Floyd by a white Minneapolis police officer who pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck.
Statues of Confederate president Jefferson Davis, Confederate Gen. Williams Carter Wickham as well as Christopher Columbus were toppled.
The protesters in Richmond started their march Tuesday night advocating for the removal of all Confederate statues, establishing a civilian policing review board and defunding the police, among other things.
The Howitzers Monument, showed a Confederate artilleryman standing in front of a gun, was erected in 1892 to memorialize the city’s Civil War artillery unit, according to the Encyclopedia of Virginia.

PORTLAND, Ore. — At least two Portland-based reporters have been hurt in recent days while covering protests against police brutality.
Oregon Public Broadcasting reports Oregonian journalist Beth Nakamura recounted being slammed by a baton. Portland Tribune reporter Zane Sparling said he was shoved into a wall by a police officer and hit by a crowd control munition.
The reporters say they identified themselves to police as press. In both incidents, the reporters were told by police, in what the journalists described as profanity-laced responses, that their press credentials did not matter.
Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler said on Twitter they were alarming incidents that need to be addressed.
Police spokesperson Lt. Tina Jones says they continue to work with media partners about the importance of following lawful orders so they can stay safe and avoid arrest or altercation.
However, members of the media have a fundamental right to do their jobs during demonstrations.

MINNEAPOLIS — A Minnesota board that licenses and set training standards for all peace officers in the state plans to review the death of George Floyd.
The Minnesota Board of Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) is required to review all misconduct complaints against licensed police officers. If the complaint is ruled justified, the board can revoke any officer’s license, the Star Tribune reported.
All four Minneapolis police officers who have been charged in the May 25 death of Floyd were fired from the department, but they are still licensed Minnesota peace officers.
The POST Board has asked the court for copies of the criminal complaints against former officer Derek Chauvin, who is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, as well as former officers Tou Thao, Thomas Lane and J. Kueng, who are all charged with aiding and abetting. A witness video captured Chauvin, who is white, pressing his knee against Floyd’s neck before the handcuffed black man died in Minneapolis.
In a statement, the board said Chauvin’s actions do not reflect any training that officers receive.
“The video is troubling and disturbing and it is the Board’s position that sanctity of life must be the guiding principle for all law enforcement officers,” the statement said.

BROOKLYN CENTER, Minn. — FBI Director Christopher Wray visited the bureau's Minneapolis field office on Tuesday to check in on employees and get briefed on the federal civil rights investigation into the officers involved in the death of George Floyd.
Minneapolis FBI spokesman Kevin Smith said Wray came to the local office on Tuesday morning for a quick “welfare check” on employees who have been working on the civil rights investigation, as well as investigations into violent protests and civil unrest. Smith said Wray offered his support and acknowledged the office’s hard work.
Smith said Wray also got a thorough briefing on the civil rights investigation, and underscored that investigators need to move swiftly but correctly as they determine whether to charge former Minneapolis police officers Derek Chauvin, J. Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao with violating Floyd’s civil rights.
Floyd, a black man who was handcuffed, died May 25 after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck, even after Floyd said he couldn’t breathe and stopped moving.
Chauvin has been charged in state court with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. The other three men are charged with aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and manslaughter. All four officers were fired.
The federal investigation is ongoing.

AMSTERDAM — Vandals have daubed red paint and the word “racist” on a statue of Mohandas Gandhi in Amsterdam, amid a wave of attacks on statues around the world of controversial historical figures.
A worker cleaned the statue Wednesday with a high-pressure water hose. Gandhi, widely lauded for his peaceful campaign to win independence for India, has faced criticism for some of his writings about black Africans.
A lawyer, Gandhi traveled to South Africa in 1893 and stayed for two decades, fighting to expand rights for Indians there. He has faced criticism for referring in his writings to black South Africans as backward. However, he later changed his views and supported the rights of black South Africans.
His nonviolent resistance methods have been used in movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.

DETROIT — A white suburban Detroit police chief has been suspended for 30 days without pay and will undergo diversity training for inappropriate social media posts about people protesting the death of George Floyd.
Trustees in Macomb County’s Shelby Township voted 5-2 on Tuesday night on the punishment for chief Robert J. Shelide, who has held the title since 2015.
Shelide, who earlier apologized, told the township board before the vote that he is “not a racist” and “I bleed blue.”
Shelide had been on administrative leave the past two weeks while officials investigated posts on a now-deleted Twitter account. Screenshots posted on Facebook show one tweet spoke about the need to “unleash real cops” and describing protesters as “barbarians” and needing “body bags.“

ATLANTA — Georgia’s lieutenant governor is proposing a version of a hate crimes law for the state.
Republican Geoff Duncan called on lawmakers to create a free-standing hate crime and include more categories of bias crimes. Those would involve people victimized because of their culture and their status in exercising First Amendment rights, including worship, free speech, free press, assembly or petition of government.
A previous effort was found unconstitutional by the state Supreme Court more than a decade ago.
In February, Ahmaud Arbery was shot near Brunswick, Georgia. Investigators have said a white man uttered a racial slur after chasing Arbery down and shooting him.
Georgia’s House passed a simpler measure last year that’s been stalled in a Senate committee for more than year. The bill would add extra penalties onto crimes committed because of someone’s race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, mental disability or physical disability.

GENEVA — The brother of George Floyd has made a heartfelt plea to the U.N.’s top human rights body to launch intense international scrutiny of systemic racism and the killing of unarmed blacks by police.
Philonese Floyd’s message by video to the Human Rights Council came as it contemplates an unprecedented bid sought by the Africa Group to create a Commission of Inquiry — the council’s most powerful tool of scrutiny — to examine and report on racism and violence against protesters by police in the United States.
“I am my brother’s keeper. You in the United Nations are your brothers and sisters’ keepers in America — and you have the power to help us get justice for my brother George Floyd,” Floyd said. “I am asking you to help him. I am asking you to help me. I am asking you to help us: Black people in America.”

HUNTINGTON, W.Va. — The Huntington City Council in West Virginia will vote Wednesday on a proposal to make Juneteenth a permanent city holiday.
The celebration commemorates when enslaved people in Texas learned they were free on June 19, 1865. Huntington Mayor Steve Williams told The Herald-Dispatch he supports the proposal and wants the city’s African American residents to know “the city celebrates Juneteenth with them just as we all celebrate July Fourth together.”
The mayor says the idea for the holiday proposal came from meetings with his diversity advisory committee amid the international protests following the death of George Floyd. Williams expects Wednesday’s meeting will help fast-track the resolution so council members can get it in the books before Friday.
The Emancipation Proclamation was signed by President Abraham Lincoln on Jan. 1, 1863, and freed enslaved people of the rebellion Confederate states.

HOUSTON — Officials say a statue of a Confederate soldier has been removed from a downtown Houston park and a second Confederate statue is expected to be removed soon.
The “Spirit of the Confederacy” statue was removed late Tuesday from Sam Houston Park. Mayor Sylvester Turner said last week the statue will be housed in the Houston Museum of African American Culture.
A second statue, of Confederate artillery commander Richard W. “Dick” Dowling, is also slated for removal. Initially, the Dowling statue was to be moved from Houston’s Hermann Park to the Sabine Pass Battleground State Historical Site near Port Arthur.
But officials say the Dowling statue will instead be placed in a warehouse, at least temporarily, after leaders in Port Arthur expressed opposition.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — A Roman Catholic chaplain at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has resigned at the request of the archdiocese after sending an email suggesting the killing of George Floyd was not an act of racism and he hadn’t lived “a virtuous life.”
The Archdiocese of Boston asked the Rev. Daniel Patrick Moloney to step down June 9 after he sent the message to Catholics at MIT, The Boston Globe reports. A statement from the archdiocese said Moloney’s comments “were wrong and by his resignation he accepts the hurt they have caused.”
The archdiocese learned about the email from Catholics at MIT and alumni. Moloney says he was trying to speak out against “cancel culture” and regrets his message has been misunderstood.
Suzy Nelson, an MIT vice president and dean for student life, sent an email to students calling Moloney’s comments “deeply disturbing” and “Father Moloney’s message failed to acknowledge the dignity of each human being and the devastating impact of systemic racism.”

GENEVA – A U.S. ambassador says the United States is committed to addressing its “shortcomings,” ahead of the U.N. human rights body's discussion of systemic racism and police brutality.
Andrew Bremberg, the U.S. ambassador in Geneva, noted President Donald Trump has condemned the actions of Minneapolis police officers involved in the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man. Trump signed an executive order on police reform on Tuesday.
“The United States recognizes and is committed to addressing its shortcomings, including racial discrimination, and injustices that stem from such discrimination, that persist in our society,” Bremberg said in a statement. “Every democracy faces challenges — the difference is how we deal with them.”
Bremberg says the executive order was “an example of how transparent and responsive our government leaders are in holding violators accountable for their actions and reforming our own system.”
The Human Rights Council in Geneva, following a call by African nations, will discuss “racially inspired human rights violations, systematic racism, police brutality and the violence against peaceful protests.”

NEW ORLEANS — The whereabouts of a statue of a slave owner toppled by protesters in New Orleans and thrown into the Mississippi River remain unknown after a group of men fished the bust out of the water.
A video shows the group using ropes and a plank to carry the paint-splattered bust of John McDonogh out of the river and onto a pickup truck Sunday.
Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s office told The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate the bust is “considered stolen property,” and whoever has it should contact the city regarding its return.
McDonogh left much of his money to New Orleans and Baltimore for schools, and many schools in New Orleans are named after him.
On McDonogh Day each year, schoolchildren from across the city lined up to lay flowers in a racially segregated ceremony. It was boycotted in the 1950s when African-American children would have to wait for hours for white children to lay their flowers first.

RICHMOND, Va. — Demonstrators in Richmond tore down another Confederate statue on Tuesday night.
The Howitzers Monument located near Virginia Commonwealth University’s Monroe Park campus was toppled after protesters spent the night marching in the rain and used a rope to pull it down from its pedestal.
A video from the Richmond Times-Dispatch shows the paint-splattered statue on the ground as the rain continued overnight in Virginia’s capital city.
It’s the third Confederate statue, and the fourth monument, to be torn down in Virginia since international protests erupted following the death of George Floyd by a white Minneapolis police officer who pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck.
Statues of Confederate president Jefferson Davis, Confederate Gen. Williams Carter Wickham as well as Christopher Columbus were toppled.
The protesters in Richmond started their march Tuesday night advocating for the removal of all Confederate statues, establishing a civilian policing review board and defunding the police, among other things.
The Howitzers Monument, showed a Confederate artilleryman standing in front of a gun, was erected in 1892 to memorialize the city’s Civil War artillery unit, according to the Encyclopedia of Virginia.

PORTLAND, Ore. — At least two Portland-based reporters have been hurt in recent days while covering protests against police brutality.
Oregon Public Broadcasting reports Oregonian journalist Beth Nakamura recounted being slammed by a baton. Portland Tribune reporter Zane Sparling said he was shoved into a wall by a police officer and hit by a crowd control munition.
The reporters say they identified themselves to police as press. In both incidents, the reporters were told by police, in what the journalists described as profanity-laced responses, that their press credentials did not matter.
Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler said on Twitter they were alarming incidents that need to be addressed.
Police spokesperson Lt. Tina Jones says they continue to work with media partners about the importance of following lawful orders so they can stay safe and avoid arrest or altercation.
However, members of the media have a fundamental right to do their jobs during demonstrations.

MINNEAPOLIS — A Minnesota board that licenses and set training standards for all peace officers in the state plans to review the death of George Floyd.
The Minnesota Board of Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) is required to review all misconduct complaints against licensed police officers. If the complaint is ruled justified, the board can revoke any officer’s license, the Star Tribune reported.
All four Minneapolis police officers who have been charged in the May 25 death of Floyd were fired from the department, but they are still licensed Minnesota peace officers.
The POST Board has asked the court for copies of the criminal complaints against former officer Derek Chauvin, who is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, as well as former officers Tou Thao, Thomas Lane and J. Kueng, who are all charged with aiding and abetting. A witness video captured Chauvin, who is white, pressing his knee against Floyd’s neck before the handcuffed black man died in Minneapolis.
In a statement, the board said Chauvin’s actions do not reflect any training that officers receive.
“The video is troubling and disturbing and it is the Board’s position that sanctity of life must be the guiding principle for all law enforcement officers,” the statement said.

BROOKLYN CENTER, Minn. — FBI Director Christopher Wray visited the bureau's Minneapolis field office on Tuesday to check in on employees and get briefed on the federal civil rights investigation into the officers involved in the death of George Floyd.
Minneapolis FBI spokesman Kevin Smith said Wray came to the local office on Tuesday morning for a quick “welfare check” on employees who have been working on the civil rights investigation, as well as investigations into violent protests and civil unrest. Smith said Wray offered his support and acknowledged the office’s hard work.
Smith said Wray also got a thorough briefing on the civil rights investigation, and underscored that investigators need to move swiftly but correctly as they determine whether to charge former Minneapolis police officers Derek Chauvin, J. Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao with violating Floyd’s civil rights.
Floyd, a black man who was handcuffed, died May 25 after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck, even after Floyd said he couldn’t breathe and stopped moving.
Chauvin has been charged in state court with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. The other three men are charged with aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and manslaughter. All four officers were fired.
The federal investigation is ongoing.

In addition, the synergistic influence of victim gender and participant gender with offender motivation was explored. Participants were 171 men and women from a small Northeastern college exposed to a stimulus in which a rapist's motivation was varied as either sexual or violent. Participants were more certain that the stimulus described a rape, recommended a longer prison sentence for the offender, and assigned less blame to the victim when exposed to an offender motivated by violence as opposed to an offender motivated by sex. Offender motivation also interacted with participant gender and victim gender on participants' perceptions of victim blame and offender responsibility. The results suggest that an offender's motivation for rape can influence perceptions of the offender's and victim's responsibility for the assault. offender motivation sexual assault victim gender participant gender T he degree to which a rape victim and rapist are perceived as responsible for a sexual assault can be influenced by factors that are tangential to the actual offense (Feild, 1979). For example, rape victims described as promiscuous or 1565 dressed provocatively are perceived as more responsible for being assaulted than victims whose sexual history is limited or who are dressed conservatively (L'Armand & Pepitone, 1982; Lewis & Johnson, 1989; Whatley, 2005). Offenders who are described as physically unattractive or who rape a victim of the same ethnic group also are held more responsible for the sexual assault than those who are described as physically attractive or who commit an interracial sexual assault (Deitz & Byrnes, 1981; George & Martinez, 2002). In addition to the influence that the victim's and offender's personal characteristics may have on perceptions of their respective degrees of responsibility for a sexual assault, the characteristics of the evaluators of rape scenarios in research stud- ies have been found to influence the degree to which they perceive the rape vic- tim and offender as responsible for a sexual assault (K. B. Anderson, Cooper, & Okamura, 1997; Pollard, 1992; Whatley, 1996). The influence of evaluator gender, in particular, on perceptions of the victim and perpetrator has been extensively studied. For example, male evaluators tend to hold rape victims more responsible for being assaulted than female evaluators (Bell, Kuriloff, & Lottes, 1994; Brems & Wagner, 1994; Deitz, Littman, & Bentley, 1984; Schult & Schneider, 1991; Szymanski, Devlin, Chrisler, & Vyse, 1993; Whatley, 2005). Thus, characteristics of the rape victim, offender, and evaluator may influence the degree to which evaluators hold the rape victim and offender responsible for the assault, even if those characteristics are tangential to the vic- tim's or offender's responsibility for the sexual assault. Offender Motivation The primary goal of the present study was to explore the influence of the offender's motivation for rape on participants' perceptions of the rape victim's and offender's responsibility for the sexual assault. That few studies have exam- ined the influence of an offender's motivation on perceptions of the rape victim and offender is surprising, given the prominent role of offender motivation in lay, theoretical, and empirical conceptualizations of rape. Such conceptualiza- tions have tended to view rape as a crime of passion or a crime of violence. Research on people's beliefs about the motivation of rape in the 1970s found that rape was commonly perceived as a crime of passion (Feild, 1978). Yet research in the 1980s found that people more commonly perceived rape as a Authors' Note: The authors wish to thank Christopher Desiere, Adriana Pilafova, Mike Richman, Jason Ruggieri, Julie Satkowski, and Jamie Weglarz for their assistance with data collection on this project.

A more recent study of college students in England found stronger support for the belief that rape is a crime of passion rather than a crime of violence (I. Anderson & Swainson, 2001). Moving beyond lay conceptualizations of rape and into the realm of scholarly research and theory, both sexual and violent motivational models of rape have been proposed. For example, theorists have proposed motiva- tional models of rape that include sexually driven offenders who are moti- vated by deviant sexual arousal (Barbaree & Marshall, 1991; Hall & Hirschman, 1991; Holmes, 1991; Knight & Prentky, 1990; Malamuth, 2003), whereas other scholars have discussed motivation for rape from a sociocultural perspective, conceptualizing rape as a crime motivated by violence and power (Brownmiller, 1975; Herman, 1990). In the latter con- ceptualization, rape is an expression of cultural mores that emphasize men's physical and social dominance over women and a violent means of maintaining this unequal power distribution. Rape is a means whereby men expressly seek to dominate women who do not fall into traditional submis- sive female roles. From this perspective, the sexually motivated aspects of rape are secondary to the facets of violence, dominance, and power. In the lone published study that has examined the influence of offender motivation on participants' perceptions of the offender's responsibility for a sexual assault, Selby and colleagues (Selby, Calhoun, & Cann, 1979) com- pared perceptions of a biologically caused rape with a psychologically caused rape in an offender motivated by sexual desire or aggression. Participants were presented with a stimulus in which the rape of a young woman was commit- ted by an offender who was subsequently examined by physicians and psy- chologists who concluded the cause of the rape was a brain tumor or a psychological disorder in an offender motivated by either sexual desire or aggression. Participants assigned greater blame and more punishment to the offender described as having a psychological disorder than to the offender described as having a brain tumor. A sexual versus aggressive motivation was not associated with perceptions of blame, but the offender described as aggres- sively motivated was assigned more punishment than the offender described as sexually motivated. The study did not examine the influence of motivation on attributions about the rape victim, but its findings suggest an offender moti- vated by violence may be viewed more punitively than one motivated by sex. Victim Gender and Participant Gender A secondary goal of the present study was to explore interactions between offender motivation and two other variables that have been established in the 1567 research literature as influencing participants' rape perceptions: the partici- pant's gender and the victim's gender. With respect to participant gender, reviews of the literature and meta-analyses have indicated that male partici- pants tend to hold rape victims more responsible for being assaulted than do female participants, and they tend to be more sensitive to the experimental manipulations that lead to less sensitivity to the victim and greater leniency toward the offender (K. B. Anderson et al., 1997; Pollard, 1992; Whatley, 1996). Therefore, the analysis of this variable in the present study seemed warranted, as did examination of its potential interaction with offender moti- vation. Compared to the relative consistency in male versus female partici- pant reactions to sexual assault victims, findings regarding victim gender have been more inconsistent and complex. Some studies have found that male rape victims are blamed for their assault more than female victims (Gerber, Cronin, & Steigman, 2004), other studies have found female rape victims are blamed more (Ford, Liwag-McLamb, & Foley, 1998; Schneider, Ee, & Aronson, 1994), and other studies have found that the influence of the vic- tim's gender on participants' perceptions is mediated by other factors (Davies, Pollard, & Archer, 2006; Wakelin & Long, 2003; White & Kurpius, 2002). This lack of consistency in the direction of the influence of victim gender suggests its influence is moderated by other factors and can therefore be difficult to predict. The present study examined the influence of an offender's motivation for rape on participants' perceptions of the rape victim and offender. Specifically, the influence of a sexually oriented motivation (sex motivated) versus an aggressively oriented motivation (violence motivated) on attributions about the victim's and offender's responsibility for the assault was compared. On the basis of the limited amount of research in this area, our tentative hypoth- esis was that participants exposed to the violence-motivated offender would be more punitive toward the offender and attribute less responsibility to the victim than participants exposed to the sex-motivated offender. The influence of victim gender and participant gender on participants' per- ceptions of the rape victim and offender was also examined in the present study. Victim gender was a variable included for exploratory reasons. The lack of consistency in the established literature concerning the direction of this vari- able's influence precluded directional predictions for main or interaction effects. With respect to participant gender, based on the established literature, it was hypothesized that female participants would be more punitive toward the offender, and attribute less responsibility to the victim, than male partici- pants. Based on these hypotheses concerning the main effect of participant gender, it could reasonably be predicted that female participants exposed to 1568 the violence-motivated offender would be more punitive toward the offender, and attribute less responsibility to the victim, than other participants. Method Participants Two hundred and fifteen undergraduate students from a small Northeastern college were recruited for the study. The final sample consisted of 171 par- ticipants (58 males and 113 females), who ranged in age from 18 to 48 years (M = 20, SD = 3.3). The majority of the participants identified them- selves as Caucasian (80.1%), followed by Latino (7.6%), African American (5.3%), Asian (4.7%), and Other (2.4%). Materials Stimulus. The stimulus developed for this study was presented in the form of a brief report describing an alleged sexual assault. The victim was described as a 24-year-old single graduate student. The gender of the victim was randomly varied. The assault occurred while the victim was walking back from the library at night. The victim was assaulted from behind by a large male stranger. The victim verbally resisted the assault but was too frightened to physically resist. During the assault, the offender whispered a statement to the victim, describing his motivation for the assault. The moti- vation was randomly varied to be either sexual or violent. In the sex-moti- vated condition, the offender whispered, “I saw you in the library tonight and thought you were hot. I'm horny as shit tonight and I need to get some no matter what it takes.” In the violence-motivated condition, the offender whis- pered, “I saw you in the library tonight and I could tell you were gay. I hate faggots [male victim]/dykes [female victim]. You're going to get what you deserve, and you'll probably like it, you queer.” The final portion of the report described the offender as a 25-year-old graduate student who claimed that he met the victim at the library and engaged in consensual sex with him or her. Poststimulus questionnaire on perceptions of victim and offender. To investigate the influence of victim gender and offender motivation on par- ticipants' perceptions of victim and offender responsibility, we used a ques- tionnaire based on one used by George and Martinez (2002). In accord with these researchers, we assessed a variety of constructs associated with per- ceptions of victim and offender responsibility: victim culpability (9 items), 1569 offender culpability (9 items), the extent to which the stimulus described a rape (1 item), and the sentencing recommendation for the offender (1 item). In addition, we developed items to assess participants' perceptions of their likelihood to convict the offender of rape (1 item), degree of victim plea- sure (1 item), degree of victim trauma (1 item), and degree of offender guilt (1 item). Each item was assessed on a 10-point Likert-type scale. Poststimulus memory test. A memory test, developed specifically for this study, was used to ensure that only data from participants who had clearly attended to the stimulus would be included in the statistical analyses. The test consisted of five multiple-choice questions about specific information provided in the stimulus. Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (SDS). This 33-item true–false questionnaire was included to control for participants' tendencies to respond to the poststimulus questionnaire in a socially desirable manner (Crowne & Marlowe, 1960). Procedure Participants were randomly assigned to one of four stimulus conditions: (a) a sex-motivated offender assaults a male victim, (b) a sex-motivated offender assaults a female victim, (c) a violence-motivated offender assaults a male victim, and (d) a violence-motivated offender assaults a female vic- tim. After signing and returning the informed consent sheet, which was given to each participant separately from the questionnaires to ensure confi- dentiality, participants were given the stimulus based on their randomly assigned condition and were provided with the questionnaires. Participants were asked to read the report stimulus before completing the questionnaires. After completing these questionnaires, participants placed their materials into an envelope and sealed it before returning it to the researchers. Results The study began with data from 215 undergraduate students. For a partic- ipant's data to be included in the statistical analyses, he or she had to correctly answer all five questions of the poststimulus memory test. Using this conser- vative criterion, data from 44 participants were excluded, leaving a final sample of 171 participants. There were no significant age, sex, or ethnicity 1570 differences between the group of excluded participants and the remaining participants. Similar to George and Martinez (2002), scale scores were developed for the multi-item dependent measure constructs (i.e., victim and offender cul- pability) on the poststimulus questionnaire. Scale construction used princi- pal components analyses with varimax rotation, factor eigenvalues greater than 1, an item loading cutoff criterion of .50, and acceptable internal con- sistency. The other dependent measures on the poststimulus questionnaire (e.g., victim pleasure, victim trauma) were individual items. The data were analyzed with a series of 2 (participant gender) × 2 (victim gender) × 2 (motivation type) between-groups ANOVAs. Scores on the SDS were used as a covariate. Significant main and interaction effects are presented below. Analyses concerning degree of victim pleasure and degree of offender guilt did not yield statistically significant findings and are not presented. Victim Culpability Principal components analysis of the nine items that assessed victim culpa- bility revealed three components accounting for 59.4% of the variance. Three items loaded on the first component, victim selfishness, victim causation, and overall victim responsibility (α = .65), and were summed to form a Victim Blame scale. Two items loaded on the second component, victim capability to have changed what happened and victim choice in the assault (α = .60), form- ing a Victim Control subscale. However, there were no significant effects for this subscale in the ANOVA. Three items also loaded on a third component that proved unreliable and were dropped from further analyses. For the Victim Blame scale, responses were skewed toward seeing the victim as not to blame for the offense. The ANOVA revealed a main effect for motivation type, F(1, 162) = 4.75, p = .031, partial η2 = .028. Participants exposed to the sex-motivated offender attributed more blame to the victim (M = 5.0, SD = 3.2) than participants exposed to the violence- motivated offender (M = 4.6, SD = 1.6). Participant gender also emerged as a main effect, F(1, 162) = 7.25, p = .008, partial η2 = .043. Male par- ticipants attributed more blame to the victim (M = 5.5, SD = 3.2) than female participants (M = 4.4, SD = 2.2). In addition to the main effects, there was a significant Participant Gender × Victim Gender interaction, F(1, 162) = 5.63, p =.019, partial η2 = .034. Analysis of the simple effects indicated that the interaction was because of gender differences in attributions toward the female victim. Male participants exposed to a female victim attributed more blame to her (M = 5.9, SD = 3.7) 1571 than did the female participants exposed to a female victim (M = 4.2, SD = 1.5; F(1, 167) = 10.15, p = .002, partial η2 = .057). Differences in blame attributions between male participants exposed to a male victim (M = 5.0, SD = 2.5) and female participants exposed to a male victim (M = 4.8, SD = 2.7) were not statistically significant. There was also a significant Participant Gender × Motivation Type inter- action, F(1, 162) = 6.26, p = .013, partial η2 = .037. Analysis of the simple effects indicated that the interaction was because of gender differences in attributions toward the sex-motivated offender. Male participants exposed to the sex-motivated offender attributed more blame to the victim (M = 6.6, SD = 4.3) than did female participants (M = 4.4, SD = 2.5), F(1, 167) = 10.22, p = .002, partial η2 = .058. Differences in blame attributions between male participants exposed to the violence-motivated offender (M = 4.7, SD = 1.6) and female participants exposed to the violence-motivated offender (M = 4.5, SD = 1.7) were not statistically significant. Victim Trauma This item was anchored by a 10-point scale (1 = none at all, 10 = very much). Responses were negatively skewed toward rating the stimulus as highly traumatic. The ANOVA revealed a significant main effect for partic- ipant gender F(1, 162) = 4.73, p = .031, partial η2 = .028. Female partic- ipants (M = 9.5, SD = 1.0) believed the victim experienced more trauma than male participants (M = 9.0, SD = 1.6). There were no other signifi- cant main or interaction effects. Offender Culpability Principal components analysis of the nine items that assessed offender culpability revealed two components accounting for 50.4% of the variance. Five items loaded on the first component—capability to have changed what happened, having a choice, blame, cause, and overall responsibility (α = .81)—and were summed to form an Offender Culpability scale. The second component proved unreliable and was dropped from further analyses. For the Offender Culpability scale, responses were skewed toward rating the offender as highly culpable for the offense. The ANOVA performed on the scale revealed only a Participant Gender × Motivation Type interaction, F(1, 162) = 4.22, p = .041, partial η2 = .025. Analysis of the simple effects revealed that male participants exposed to the sex-motivated offender rated the offender less culpable (M = 44.57, SD = 7.60) than did female participants 1572 exposed to the sex-motivated offender (M = 47.9, SD = 4.8), F(1, 167) = 6.24, p =.013, partial η2 = .036. Differences in offender culpability ratings between male participants exposed to the violence-motivated offender (M = 47.4, SD = 3.9) and female participants exposed to the violence-motivated offender (M = 47.5, SD = 3.8) were not statistically significant. Was It Rape? This item was anchored by a 10-point scale (1 = definitely not rape, 10 = definitely rape). Responses were negatively skewed toward rating the stimu- lus as definitely rape. The ANOVA revealed significant main effects for moti- vation type, F(1, 162) = 3.96, p = .048, partial η2 = .10. Participants exposed to the violence-motivated offender (M = 9.6, SD = 0.7) were more certain the incident constituted rape than participants exposed to the sex- motivated offender (M = 9.2, SD = 1.8). There was also a main effect for participant gender, F(1, 162) = 5.85, p = .017, partial η2 = .036. Female par- ticipants (M = 9.5, SD = 1.4) were more certain the incident constituted rape than male participants (M = 9.1, SD = 1.3). Likelihood to Convict This item was anchored by a 10-point scale (1 = very unlikely, 10 = very likely). Responses on this item were negatively skewed toward a relatively high likelihood rating of convicting the offender for sexual assault. The ANOVA revealed a significant three-way interaction between participant gender, victim gender, and motivation type, F(1, 162) = 5.71, p = .018, partial η2 = .034. Analysis of the simple effects indicated that male and female participants responded differently to a sex-motivated rape of a female victim, with female participants rating a greater likelihood of convicting the offender (M = 9.3, SD = 1.1) than male participants (M = 8.1, SD = 1.6), F(1, 163) = 5.25, p = .023, partial η2 = .031. There was not a statistically significant difference between female participants exposed to the sex-motivated rape of a male vic- tim (M = 9.0, SD = 1.9) and male participants exposed to the sex-motivated rape of a male victim (M = 9.2, SD = 1.2), nor were there significant effects for the conditions involving the victim of the violence-motivated rape. Sentencing Recommendations This item was anchored by a 10-point scale (1 = no time at all, 10 = more than 40 years). The ANOVA revealed a significant main effect for 1573 motivation type, F(1, 162) = 6.10, p = .015, partial η2 = .036. Higher prison sentences were recommended for the violence-motivated offender (M = 7.1, SD = 2.0) than for the sex-motivated offender (M = 6.5, SD = 1.8). There was also a significant main effect for victim gender, F(1, 162) = 3.87, p = .05, partial η2 = .036. Participants exposed to the female vic- tim (M = 7.9, SD = 2.0) believed the offender should serve a longer prison sentence than participants exposed to the male victim (M = 6.6, SD = 1.9). There was also significant interaction for motivation type and victim gender, F(1, 162) = 15.6, p < .0001, partial η2 = .088. Analysis of the simple effects indicated that exposure to the violence-motivated rape of a female victim led to longer prison sentences (M = 7.9, SD = 1.8) than the sex-motivated rape of a female victim (M = 6.2, SD = 1.7), F(1, 167) = 17.10, p < .0001, partial η2 = .093. Differences in recommended sentenc- ing between participants exposed to the violence-motivated rape of a male victim (M = 6.3, SD = 1.9) and those exposed to the sex-motivated rape of a male victim (M = 6.8, SD = 1.9) were not statistically significant. Discussion The primary aim of the present study was to examine the influence of a sexual offender's motivation on the perceptions of the rape victim's and offender's responsibility for the sexual assault. The individual and interac- tion effects of the participant's gender and victim's gender on such percep- tions also were of interest. Overall, participants perceived the assault described in the stimulus as rape and perceived the offender as responsible for the assault regardless of the offender's motivation or the victim's gender. Similarly, participants perceived the victim as not responsible for being assaulted and as experiencing a high level of trauma from the assault regard- less of the offender's motivation or the victim's gender. Thus, participants were not insensitive to the victim, nor were they exculpatory toward the offender. Yet within these parameters, significant differences in perceptions of the victim and offender emerged and in a relatively consistent manner. The results indicate that knowledge of an offender's motivation influ- enced participants' perceptions of the victim and offender. Overall, the find- ings regarding offender motivation suggest that reactions are more punitive toward the offender, and more sensitive toward the victim, when the offender is described as motivated by violence as compared to sex. There were three significant main effects regarding offender motivation. Compared to partic- ipants exposed to the sex-motivated offender, participants exposed to the 1574 violence-motivated offender were more certain that the stimulus described a rape, recommended a longer prison sentence for the offender, and assigned less blame to the victim. Other significant findings regarding offender motivation were inter- twined with the participant's gender and/or the victim's gender. Participant gender interacted with offender motivation in two analyses. First, male par- ticipants exposed to the sex-motivated offender attributed more blame to the victim than did female participants. Second, male participants assigned less blame to the sex-motivated offender than did female participants. Victim gender also interacted with offender motivation in one analysis: Violence-motivated offenders of female victims received longer recom- mended prison sentences than sex-motivated offenders of female victims. Finally, there was one Offender Motivation × Participant Gender × Victim Gender interaction: Female participants were more likely to convict a sex- motivated offender of a female victim than were male participants. The motivation of a sex offender's illicit behavior is a variable regarded as relevant to the assessment and treatment of such offenders (Terry, 2006). The present study suggests that this variable may also be relevant in how people perceive the responsibility of the victim and offender. In this regard, offender motivation is the latest in a series of identified offender character- istics, such as race, occupation, and physical attractiveness, found to influ- ence perceptions of the offender's and victim's responsibility. The consistent nature of the results invites speculation as to why a violence- motivated offender elicits more punitive reactions than a sex-motivated offender. One possibility is that the lack of an overt sexual motivation on the part of the violence-motivated offender lessens any tendency to view the vic- tim as having been in any way sexually provoking or acting in some other form of shared responsibility for the assault. The stated motivation of violence may have precluded perceiving the victim as “asking for it” through seductive behavior and thereby led to more blame for the offender. A second possibility is that people may be less able to justify or understand an offender motivated by violence than one motivated by sexual desire, because there is an overt lack of congruence between the offender's motivation and his behavior. Because the violence-motivated offender's sexual actions were overtly contrary to his stated hatred of the victim's sexuality, his justification may have been per- ceived as less credible than that of the sex-motivated offender. Understanding how varied offender motivations get translated into varied perceptions of the victim's and offender's responsibility for the assault awaits further study. In addition to offender motivation, participant gender was a main effect in perceptions of the victim and offender, and this effect revealed itself in a 1575 consistent manner: Female participants demonstrated more punitive reactions to the offender and greater sensitivity to the victim. Compared to male par- ticipants, female participants were more certain the stimulus described a rape, assigned less blame to the victim, perceived the victim as experiencing more trauma, rated the offender as more culpable for the offense, and recom- mended longer prison sentences for the offense. These findings are consistent with prior studies about the relation between participant gender and rape attri- butions (K. B. Anderson et al., 1997; Pollard, 1992; Whatley, 1996). In contrast to participant gender, victim gender was not a main effect in perceptions of the victim. Its lone main effect lay in perceptions of the offender: The offender who assaulted a female victim was recommended for a longer prison sentence than the offender who assaulted a male victim. This is consistent with research that has found that the rape of a man is associated with stereotypes that downplay the significance of the offense (Donnelly & Kenyon, 1996; Struckman-Johnson & Struckman-Johnson, 1992). One limitation of the present study was the use of a stimulus that portrayed a rape that involved strangers rather than acquaintances, occurred in a public rather than a private location, and demonstrated high use of physical force rather than low use of force. These features are hallmarks of the stereotypical image of rape. Such features tend to produce less victim blaming than stim- uli that involve rape involving acquaintances, private locations, and low use of physical force (Brems & Wagner, 2002; Bridges & McGrail, 1989; Muehlenhard & MacNaughton, 1988). In this respect, the stimulus used in the present study provided a stringent test of the relation between offender motivation and victim blaming but may not generalize to other kinds of rape. The role of offender motivation on attributions regarding victim and offender responsibility in cases of acquaintance rape that involve low use of physical force is an area that could be explored in further research. Another limitation posed by the stimulus used in the present study con- cerns the origins of the violence-motivated offender's behavior. The offender in the violence-motivated condition attacked the victim under the impression that the victim was gay, which may have made the rape some- what akin to that of a hate crime in the eyes of some participants. Although the sexual orientation of the victim was not presented, participants' stereo- types regarding gay men and lesbians may have been activated by the stim- ulus and been a factor in their perceptions of the victim and offender. It is possible that the interaction of victim gender and perpetrator motivation could be tapping the influence of a perpetrator's sexual orientation on rape attributions. However, this would likely be demonstrated with significant differences between or within the male victim conditions. This was not the 1576 case; rather, we found differences only within the female victim conditions. In addition, the impact of a violence-motivated offender of this nature on participants' perceptions may be different from that of a violence-motivated offender whose anger and aggression stems from a different source, such as rejection by a potential partner or hatred of women in general. Nonetheless, future research could do well to explore female victims only (which account for a much larger percentage of total victims anyway) as well as other origins of aggressively motivated rape. The results of the study add to the small database of existing research into the relation between the motivation of an offender who commits a rape and how people evaluate the victim and offender. Understanding this relation in greater depth can help us understand how juries may weigh an offender's motivation for rape in their deliberations. In addition to the methodology used in the present study, other means of researching this topic in the future could be mock jury methodologies in which evidence and arguments are presented to participants in a focus group format. Such future research may be able to provide additional information about the manner in which offender motivation data can specifically affect the outcome of a trial.

Aired 5:30-6a ET",FALSE,"[05:31:05]
JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: Breaking overnight, the governor of Kentucky is promising a swift and transparent investigation after the fatal shooting of a protester in Louisville. That shooting led to the city's police chief being fired.
CNN's Evan McMorris-Santoro is live in Louisville with the latest there. Evan, what have you learned?
EVAN MCMORRIS-SANTORO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, hey, guys. Let's talk about -- a little bit about what didn't happen yesterday before we talk about what did happen.
Authorities and local officials -- local advocates -- were worried that yesterday was going to be a bad day here in Louisville because overnight, on Sunday night, there was another incident where police and protesters interacted and there was a shooting and a local barbecue purveyor -- a sort of pillar of the community -- was killed in the western part of this city.
Folks were afraid that that would rekindle some of the conversations that's been -- and some of the incidents that have been happening here in this city, but actually, we ended up having a pretty quiet day overall. An emotional day of peaceful protests all across the city.
Marchers gathered here in Jefferson Square where I am -- where they have been gathering for a while protesting the death of Breonna Taylor as well as George Floyd -- marching from here to where the site of that shooting of that barbecue purveyor happened on the west side of town, and then all marching back here.
So it was all pretty peaceful -- angry, but peaceful protests until about 10:00, which is an hour into curfew when police showed up here in Jefferson Square, gave a bunch of warnings, and then began disbursing the crowd, which happened pretty quickly. But they did disburse the crowd with pepper balls and tear gas, and some of the scenes we've seen all over the country.
BERMAN: Lexington, nearby, Evan, I understand there was a scene of community and togetherness, yes? MCMORRIS-SANTORO: Yes. I mean, according to reports, what we saw is some of those images we've seen from around the country where police and protesters got together and hugged each other and I think tried to have some community moments.
But, you know, that's the thing that, again, authorities here in Lexington told -- I mean, in Louisville told me that yesterday was a day where police and protesters also interacted. They were able to walk around, you know, together. They weren't necessarily hugging or interacting in that way but it was a scene where it wasn't the kind of standoff that we've seen between protesters and police on other nights.
And otherwise, here in Louisville as well, we didn't see looting. We haven't seen reports of that or any of the sort of other violence that has punctuated the -- that has -- other days of these protests.
But here, it was -- it was a relatively quiet night last night despite the fact that another incident leading to another round of investigations of the police here began on Sunday night.
BERMAN: All right, Evan McMorris-Santoro in Louisville. Keep us posted throughout the morning, Evan -- Alisyn.
ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR: OK, John.
The National Guard and local police sweeping through downtown Atlanta as a 9:00 p.m. curfew went into effect for the third-straight night. There were tense moments and dozens of arrests.
CNN's Dianne Gallagher is live in Atlanta with the latest. So what happened, Dianne?
DIANNE GALLAGHER, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Alisyn, and most of those arrests were actually for curfew violations -- 95 of them last night. You might be able to there we're still under curfew here in Atlanta and we will be through sunrise.
According to the police, it was because the protesters, after curfew ended, would not leave Centennial Olympic Park inside here. They began throwing rocks and other projectiles at them and that's when those arrests began.
Now look, this is the fourth night of protesting. There have been just over 350 people arrested in Atlanta. And last night was by far the most people -- the most peaceful of those four nights.
There were some intense moments in between the protesters, law enforcement, and National Guard, who were all out here, but there were also moments where you saw some of that reconciliation as well where officers took a knee with the protesters in solidarity.
[05:35:11]
Unfortunately, we then saw, moments later, things being thrown again and tear gas being deployed. So, you know, in some cases, we're starting to see small steps here and then many steps back.
We were with marchers in Atlanta for four hours going through the city and they said that all they really want is justice and change. They are asking for things like hate crime bills to be passed here in the state of Georgia and for better policing tactics. And they say that they don't plan to stop until they get some kind of response, not just from state officials but they see something at the national and federal level.
CAMEROTA: Yes. I think that they speak for protesters everywhere. I mean, that's just one microcosm of what's happening across the country.
Dianne, thank you very much.
Across the country it was night seven of protests, most peaceful -- most of the demonstrators expressing their outrage peacefully -- but some did resort to lawlessness and violence. So we have reports from around the country for you, next.
[05:40:45]
BERMAN: In Dallas, protesters facing off with police in the middle of a bridge. In Los Angeles, a largely peaceful day followed by some looting on Sunset Boulevard. The latest from our reporters across the country.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
ED LAVANDERA, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I'm Ed Lavandera in Dallas.
Several hundred protesters were detained on the Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge just west of downtown Dallas Monday night after what started off as a protest on the steps of the county courthouse turned into a march and a confrontation with law enforcement here on this bridge.
Several hundred of these protesters showing up here on this bridge essentially shutting it down, and a wall of hundreds of law enforcement showing up as well. Smoke canisters were fired into the crowd, rubber bullets were also fired into the crowd, and that's when the protesters laid down on the ground and they were taken into custody.
BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I'm Brian Todd in Philadelphia where police are rounding up protesters who have violated curfew. They tell us there's one man being put in zip ties and being put in a bus over there.
Police engaged in two very tense standoffs on Monday that we were caught up in the middle of when they fired tear gas canisters at protesters who had marched onto a highway, then engaged in a very tense standoff with protesters right in front of police headquarters in downtown Philadelphia. Police had taken a knee in deference to the protesters -- that's what appears (ph) -- then police moved in in force, in tactical gear, and forced the protesters out right in front of police headquarters.
RYAN YOUNG, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I'm Ryan Young in the city of Chicago.
And Monday saw protesters take a different tactic in that we saw large gatherings that remained peaceful. At one point, they even took over Lake Shore Drive. But there was some looting in the early Monday morning hours but that was pretty much stopped throughout the day.
Police used a different tactic. They blocked off the downtown district using heavy machinery. One thing that we were also told is on Sunday alone, police arrested 699 people. The city of Chicago hopes that the new tactics help them calm down the protests that some said got out of control.
KYUNG LAH, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I'm Kyung Lah in Los Angeles where this city is enforcing its curfew.
And what we are seeing here on Sunset Boulevard, the Los Angeles Police Department taking people into custody who are in violation of the curfew. You can see dozens of people with their faces against the plywood, their hands in zip ties because they are out past the curfew. The people you are looking at are now subject to arrest.

CAMEROTA: Our thanks to our correspondents around the country.
President Trump is threatening to deploy active-duty military to America's streets. He says they will target anti-fascist extremists who he alleges are organizing the riots. But the administration has not presented evidence to back up that claim. So who exactly are the rioters and the looters?
CNN's Drew Griffin investigates.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
DREW GRIFFIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Cherry-pick the videos like we did here and it's easy to find young, white men throwing rocks, breaking glass, and making it appear the protests over George Floyd's death have turned into an Antifa riot. It's not, according to elected officials.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't have evidence as to where they're from or what their ideology may be.
GRIFFIN (voice-over): Though Minnesota's governor said outsiders share the blame for the destruction, CNN's review shows 80 percent of those booked into the jail in Minneapolis are local. CNN found no overt evidence any of them were linked to extremist groups.
Historian Mark Bray wrote the Antifa handbook and sees a protest that is neither Antifa nor anarchist.
MARK BRAY, AUTHOR, ""ANTIFA: THE ANTI-FASCIST HANDBOOK"": If you look at the images, some groups may be organized. But there's plenty of individuals or groups of friends who are simply frustrated about the continual police murder of black people and have given up hope, it seems, on the ability of the system to reform itself.
GRIFFIN (voice-over): Federal officials say they've seen indications that extremists on both the left and the right may be taking part in the mayhem but, so far, have not produced evidence. What you can find is people who don't seem to fit in any category in Minneapolis today.
RYAN TEDDER, BOOGALOO MOVEMENT: I'm with the Boogaloos.
GRIFFIN (voice-over): Ryan Tedder goes to protest as part of the Boogaloo's movement. He drove from North Carolina to Minnesota after seeing a post on the Internet about police using tear gas at the George Floyd marches.
TEDDER: We're just a group that believes in ultimate personal freedom, as long as you're not hurting anybody else.
[05:45:03]
GRIFFIN (voice-over): The movement, he says, is anti-police, anti- government. Members carry loaded guns to protest. The ADL calls them right-wing and says white supremacists have also taken up the cause.
Tedder says he sides with the black protesters and is a left-anarchist who carries his assault-style weapons into protests not to use them, he says, but to protect protesters from police.
TEDDER: The protesters have done nothing wrong. They've been attacked and they are responding with violence to violence, which is completely reasonable.
GRIFFIN (voice-over): Levi Hicks says he is also Boogaloo from Earle, Indiana.
LEVI HICKS, BOOGALOO MOVEMENT: What we stand for is the peaceful (INAUDIBLE) at every level. It's from federal, law enforcement, and anything in between.
GRIFFIN (voice-over): He has carried weapons to protest in Indianapolis and Louisville, and recently posted on Facebook a cartoon showing a police officer getting shot in the face.
HICKS: That post, that was never meant to be taken literally seriously anyway.
GRIFFIN (on camera): So the -- just to be clear, the post of a cop getting his head blown off was not to be taken literally?
HICKS: Absolutely not. I've never endorsed violence against another person. I would never in any concept recommend that anybody murder a police officer. GRIFFIN (voice-over): Radical political theorist and author George Ciccariello-Maher says he the protests from a movement begun a decade ago.
GEORGE CICCARIELLO-MAHER, POLITICAL THEORIST AND AUTHOR: What we're seeing, as I said, is the end of a trajectory that's gone more than 10 years of growing consciousness, growing resistance, and a growing willingness to honestly confront the powers that continue to oppress certain communities.
GRIFFIN (voice-over): Drew Griffin, CNN, Atlanta.

CAMEROTA: Well, you've seen the violence between police and protesters but there are also acts of kindness in this crisis, and Jeanne Moos is going to show us that, next.
[05:50:57]
BERMAN: This morning, new examples of police and protesters coming together. Here's CNN's Jeanne Moos.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
JEANNE MOOS, CNN NATIONAL NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): They're not just on opposite sides of the barricades, barricades are being thrown. While interactions between police and protesters are just causing the kind of tears that sting, there are moving moments as well, particularly when officers kneel with protesters from Coral Gables to Oklahoma City to Portland, Oregon. Even chiefs of police and sheriffs are kneeling to honor the loss of George Floyd.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And us joining them in a symbolic way, that's the least we can do.
MOOS (voice-over): Some are even marching with protesters --
SHERIFF CHRIS SWANSON, FLINT, MICHIGAN: I took my helmet off and laid the batons down.
MOOS (voice-over): -- like Sheriff Chris Swanson in Flint, Michigan.
SWANSON: Where do you want to walk? We'll walk all night.
MOOS (voice-over): Green Bay's police chief walked --
PROTESTERS: Black lives matter!
MOOS (voice-over): -- united in dismay over how George Floyd died.
ANDREW SMITH, POLICE CHIEF, GREEN BAY, WISCONSIN: Just like, you, I was sickened.
MOOS (voice-over): Even a gesture like removing a hat helps.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: To the Floyd family.
MOOS (voice-over): Instead of grappling, there were even hugs.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: People hugging a police officer? I'm like, what?
MOOS (voice-over): When Orlando's police chief and a sheriff knelt they were naysayers. ""Ignore this propaganda. At the exact time Orlando P.D. posted this tweet, I was rinsing out the eyes of peaceful protesters.""
And yet, protesters formed a ring to protect this police officer in Louisville from the crowd. And in New York City, an officer shared his hand sanitizer. One hand literally washes the other.
Jeanne Moos, CNN, New York.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
CAMEROTA: I'm really glad that Jeanne is showing us that. I mean, maybe these small acts of kindness can lead to the bigger fundamental changes that they're calling for.
BERMAN: You know, it's going to take more of that. And I will say, I don't think it's small. I think if one of the fundamental goals is de- escalation, we see what works. We see what works. So --
CAMEROTA: Absolutely. I mean, humanity tends to work. You know, reaching across the barricade and showing somebody that you hear them and that you understand them. And I'm so happy that we're seeing examples of that amidst the violence.
BERMAN: Amidst the violence -- and there is that as well because this morning, America is in crisis. New developments into the newsroom over just the last few hours. Reports of attacks against police officers. And also, the aftermath of the crackdown on peaceful protesters in front of the White House so the president could take a picture. We have the latest for you.
[05:58:05]
ANNOUNCER: This is CNN breaking news.
BERMAN: Welcome to our viewers in the United States and all around the world. This is NEW DAY. It's Tuesday, June second. It's 6:00 here in New York.
And breaking overnight, America in crisis, Americans attacked, Americans suffering, and President Trump keeps fanning the flames.
We have major new developments over just the last few hours.
In St. Louis, four police officers have been shot. None of their injuries are thought to be life-threatening. In New York City, a police officer is in serious condition after apparently being intentionally run over in the Bronx. We're also following reports of two police-involved shootings in Las Vegas with one officer shot.
This violent night follows a day of mostly peaceful protests. In Minneapolis, George Floyd's brother begged for peace at the intersection where his brother was killed.
CAMEROTA: And, John, there was also an unbelievable scene that unfolded outside of the White House. First, in a Rose Garden address, President Trump claimed to be, quote, ""an ally"" of peaceful protesters. Minutes later, he had police use tear gas, flash grenades, and rubber bullets against those peaceful protesters, clearing a space so he could have a photo op in front of a church.
That drew the outrage of the bishop of the diocese. She calls the president's message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus. We'll get to that.
But our coverage begins with Brynn Gingras. She is live in New York with what's happened while you have been sleeping. Brynn, what's the situation?
BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Alisyn, good morning.
Listen, curfew here in New York City was 11:00 p.m. last night but the violence was being reported in even before that -- even before really it got dark.
I want to show you video here from the Bronx, an incident that happened with a police sergeant there. It's pretty disturbing, I want to warn you.
Essentially, at 12:45 in the morning in the Bronx, police responding to a looting incident, we're told, and one of the sergeants responding was hit by a vehicle. That driver of the car got away."
163,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1251/Files (250).DOCX","Pipe Dream: SUNY at Binghamton",2020-10-19,"1361 words","NEWS; Pg. 1","Ariel Wajnrajch",NA,"We must reevaluate our understanding of Zionism",FALSE,"As a Jewish Democrat from New York, I find myself thinking about U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez quite a lot. I watch the video discussing her experiences with misogyny in the workplace, particularly on Capitol Hill, and I can't help but identify with her. But I'm troubled by the way she addresses issues of anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism and the intersectionality that exists between the two.
Ultimately, anti-Semitism is not lacking on either side of the political aisle. Left-wing anti-Semitism is a more nuanced and complicated phenomenon in comparison with right-wing anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism isn't attributed to a political party, but rather a widespread sentiment in the United States, alarmingly on the rise over the past few years. In 2019, the Anti-Defamation League recorded the number of anti-Semitic hate crimes in the United States was higher than had ever been recorded, according to the Anti-Defamation League which started recording in 1979.
I see a lot of confounding within that intersectionality of anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism, especially from some people identifying with the left. I'm an Israeli citizen and a daughter of a native Israeli woman. I hate Netanyahu just as much as my mother does, as much as many of my fellow Jewish and Zionist friends, maybe even as much as Ocasio-Cortez. I criticize his actions often and I pray that he loses his seat as prime minister of the state of Israel. I do not believe that Israel's current government has the right political agenda, especially when it comes to Netanyahu's goals of annexing parts of the West Bank and his alignment with far-right parties in creating his coalitions.
To be clear, far-right here doesn't have the same meaning as it does in American politics. It has a more hawkish definition, often standing for annexation of territories such as the West Bank, like Netanyahu's actions, as well as against a two-state solution. The left wing tends to be dovish, advocating for more collaboration with Palestinians. These wings further the point that this is in fact complicated, and that criticism is necessary. But denying Israel's right to exist altogether shouldn't happen. Ultimately, I am only citing my personal opinions and beliefs and I am trying my very best not to make generalizations or alienate anybody. I am still learning and I believe that anyone's opinions on this topic are just as valid as those I'm sharing.
As part of this polarization in the states, we see a lot of sensationalism with regards to the issues of both Israel and Palestine. We see people going to either extreme, saying that only one nation has the right to exist. Ultimately that middle ground is something that I think a lot of people would agree with - that both nations should exist and that it should be a priority to achieve that. According to a Gallup poll from April of this year, there is widespread sympathy for those on both sides and recognition of rights of both peoples, so a two-state solution should not be out of the question. Additionally, there is a fairly widespread opinion among Americans that there should be an independent Palestinian state in the Gaza Strip and in the West Bank, while the same poll shows also widespread support for Israel. There's a solid population of people who are for some form of a two-state solution. No one seems to consider the idea of a peaceful two-state solution because President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu haven't really shown much regard for that sentiment. I couldn't say whose fault that is and that isn't the point, but that's what I think we need. That's the only way our children will stop dying on both sides.
I feel immensely proud to be half Israeli and half American. At the same time that I feel that pride, I dislike the leaders of both governments a lot. I believe that Netanyahu is, knowingly or unknowingly, perpetuating the long standing anti-Zionism on the left by neglecting the human rights of the Palestinians. I also believe that our president, in the United States, is neglecting the human rights of much of this country and I take immense issue with both of these facts.
There's widespread villainizing of Zionists in the United States, even though our actual belief is that Israel has the right to exist and that has nothing to do with the atrocities that occur in the Middle East. This is largely due to the sensationalism of the extreme. Our role as Jews and/or Zionists in these atrocities is virtually nonexistent, especially as college students, compared to big shots who donate tons of money to further their agendas in Israel. On top of that, Zionism has nothing to do with the atrocities that Netanyahu has caused or let happen. It is simply the belief that Israel has the right to exist, such a bare minimum request that unfortunately comes into question so frequently, just as Palestinian people's rights to their country are questioned.
I believe in the duality of pride in one's country and criticism of it, its leaders especially. I believe in the duality of hating the president/prime minister and loving the country, in the duality of protesting and patriotism and while so many people consider it unpatriotic, I believe in the First Amendment right to criticize this country. It is incredibly patriotic to fight for the betterment of this nation and that fighting can take many forms. Whether it's lobbying, protesting, taking legal action or running for office or voting, it is patriotic to love America despite its flaws, but also work to better it. The same goes for Israel. Generation Zers especially fight for policy change and change in leadership all the time. As a dual citizen, I make sure to always juxtapose my support and love for Israel with my anger toward its leadership. This doesn't make me any less of a Zionist - it makes me more of one. I love Israel so much that I pray for the betterment of it. More than pray for it, I fight for it, lobby for it, contact my representatives to talk about it and most importantly, I learn about it. In some ways, that's one of the truest forms of pride, to love but to recognize fault and to work toward changes.
I believe in the foundation of the United States, as well as the foundation of the state of Israel, and, although they took wrong turns in getting here, both countries are just as valid today as they were on their respective independence days. I also believe that Palestine should exist, and that it should function peacefully and in harmony with Israel.
Ultimately, Ocasio-Cortez seems to agree with this idea that a duality can exist between recognizing Israel's right to exist and criticizing its leader.
""To conflate an individual leader or ego with being against the entire country, I think, is a hallmark behavior of folks like our president,"" she said. ""Just like we have the ability to criticize our president without being anti-American, I believe we can criticize the policies and decisions that the administration over there is pursuing without being against a country overall.""
As of 2011, there were more than 25,000 Jews living in New York's 14th congressional district, the district which Ocasio-Cortez represents. Although unlikely that all of them are Zionists, it's likely that she has many people in her constituency that would care to see what happens between America and Israel as well as Israel and Palestine. When my representatives are voting on something I find relevant to my cause, I do my best to contact them to ensure that they will vote in such a way that will continue America's long standing relationship with Israel.
The United States' relationship with Israel reaches further than President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu's policies and it means far more than their relationship ever will. It ensures the safety and security of both countries in a number of mutually beneficial ways. Hopefully, in the future, it will mean that the United States will help Israel and Palestine forge a bond, leading to peace and an end to violence and bloodshed, but I don't think either country's current leaders will be the ones to make that happen.

Gold prices have doubled since 2015, and the price for an ounce of gold now is over $2,000. The maxim that gold is a safe harbor investment during an economic storm has been proven right yet again. The NBP invested heavily in gold two years ago. Since 2018, it has purchased 125 tons of gold, effectively doubling the nation's gold reserves that for years had been kept at just over 100 tons.[57] UK Employment Tumbles by 220,000, Biggest Quarterly Fall Since 2009[58] LONDON (AP) — The number of people in employment in the UK fell by 220,000 in the three months after the country was put into lockdown as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, official figures showed Tuesday. That quarterly decline, which took the total number of people in employment to 32.92 million, is the biggest since the deep recession in 2009 in the wake of the global financial crisis.[59] 2 Dead in Redwood City Triple Stabbing[60] San Mateo County sheriff's deputies are investigating a triple stabbing early Tuesday that left one of the victims as well as the suspect dead, officials said.[61] After Biden Chooses Kamala Harris as Running Mate, Trump Campaign Calls Her His 'Living Will'[62] After Joe Biden announced his choice of Kamala Harris to be his running mate in the 2020 presidential election, the Trump campaign's 2020 senior adviser Katrina Pierson came out firing, calling Harris Biden's 'political living will.'[63] Authorities Capture Suspect in 5-Year-Old's Fatal Shooting[64] Wilson police said officers responding to a report of a shooting at a mobile home park found Cannon Hinnant suffering from a gunshot wound.[65] Big Tech Embeds Itself in the Biden Campaign[66] It took four years to properly politically and ideologically direct and train Big Tech to police users' conversations in the US, but some big publishers who align with the same political circles as Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden — and much of the leadership of Big Tech companies — finally seem to be detecting some promising signs. It started with Democrats' — to say the least — criticism of large US tech companies, many of whom control giant social media and are therefore perfectly positioned to close that gap that was left on the sidelines four years ago, as liberals focused on strict control of corporate media, forgetting by and large the new, internet variety.[67] BLM Protesters Met With Jeers by Armed Crowd of Counter Protesters in Nevada City[68] MINDEN, Nev. (AP) — Several dozen Black Lives Matter demonstrators at a weekend protest in rural Nevada were greeted by a far larger group of counter-demonstrators, including some bearing military-style weapons and tactical gear, but a sheriff who had made controversial remarks earlier about the racial injustice movement reported no arrests or serious incidents. The clash of rallies Saturday came days after Douglas County Sheriff Dan Coverley attracted national attention for telling the local library not to bother calling 911 for help after board members publicly considered a statement opposing 'all forms of racism, hatred, inequality and injustice' and the line 'We support #Black Lives Matter.' The library abandoned plans to issue the diversity statement and the sheriff backed off, saying deputies would continue to respond to all 911 calls[69][70] California County Declares Itself 'Sanctuary County' For Church Gatherings[71] The district attorney for San Luis Obispo County, California, has announced it to be a 'sanctuary county' for churches and worshippers. District Attorney Dan Dow said in July that he will not prosecute people for leading or attending church services, which have been outlawed in most California counties under Gov. Gavin Newsom's coronavirus lockdown orders. Newsom also has prohibited singing in churches throughout the state, another mandate that Dow said he refuses to enforce.[72] Comcast Bans Laura Loomer From Sending Texts &#38; Emails to Voters[73] Comcast and its subsidiary Xfinity has banned Republican Congressional candidate Laura Loomer from sending out texts and emails to voters in what appears to be yet another example of Big Tech election meddling. 'See video. Wow. @Xfinity/@comcast has BANNED Republican front-runner Laura Loomer from sending texts &#38; emails to voters. This is next-level censorship,' tweeted Fox News host Pete Hegseth. 'When she wins the @gop primary on Tuesday, will the Republican Party fight for her? They'd better!'[74] DuckDuckGo Developers Urge Justice Department to Force Android to Allow Default Search Engine Choice[75] Representatives of the search engine DuckDuckGo have suggested to the Justice Department the implementation of an option that would let Android users select their default search engine so that Google's monopoly is reduced without the need to apply aggressive sanctions. The last few weeks in the world of technology have been difficult for the dominant companies in the market. Different governments are concerned about the monopolies that services such as Google have created, so they have convened their main executives to find solutions that are as fair as possible for the market.[76] Ghislaine Maxwell Taken Off Suicide Watch as She Moans About 'Hell-Hole' Jail and Middle of the Night Strip-Searches[77] GHISLAINE Maxwell has moaned about the conditions in the 'hell-hole' Brooklyn jail where she's locked up ahead of her sex-crimes trial. The 58-year-old British socialite is being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center, where she complains she is subjected to strip searches despite being taken off suicide watch.[78] Google Now Labels Black-Owned Businesses in Search as it Embraces Black Lives Matter Movement[79] Technology giant Google is singling out Black-owned businesses with special labels in order to support this specific demographic during the coronavirus pandemic. In its search engine, Google has begun identifying businesses owned by Blacks with a 'Black-owned' label. The company has also issued instructions on how Blacks can receive the label. Google's move is seen as an attempt to copy Black Lives Matter activists who put similar signs on shops and restaurants run by Blacks, a trend that began following the death of George Floyd and the nationwide riots and protests that it sparked.[80] Gun Violence Tops Recent Notable Crimes in Madison Area[81] In one of the most dangerous incidents in a summer of record-breaking gun violence in Madison, several people fired into a crowd celebrating the life of a man slain last month, sending panicked adults and children running for cover and leaving three people with gunshot wounds. Police on Wednesday marveled that no one was killed in the mayhem that broke out around 9 p.m . in Garner Park on the city's West Side, where several as-yet-unidentified people approached the park's shelter from the area of Mineral Point Road and fired handguns and likely an AK-47 at the more than 300 people gathered to memorialize 24-year-old Maurice R. Bowman Jr.[82] In Portland's Tumultuous Summer, Police Face Surge in Gun Violence as Well as Nightly Protests[83] PORTLAND — During early August protests, two storefront windows were shattered in Bart Garmon's barbershop in a historic building, where he was trying to revive his business after a three-month closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Last weekend, after an arson fire was set at a nearby police union office, protesters again surged through his North Portland block, and someone spray-painted graffiti — 'All Cops are Bastards' — on the protective plywood. So on Sunday, which was supposed to be a day off, he was back down at his business, applying a fresh coat of tan paint to obscure the lettering. 'We are a cornerstone of this community. This shouldn't happen. We are here to make people look good and feel good,' Garmon said. Garmon's business is one of the casualties in an intense new round of protests this month. Federal law enforcement officers have stayed off the streets, but Portland police have been out in force every night, often deep into the early morning hours — to respond to protesters, some of whom have sought to break in or set fire to buildings used by police. Portland police's renewed focus on protests comes amid a surge in shootings and homicides, which took the lives of 15 people in July, the highest monthly tally in 30 years. The Portland Police Bureau chief says the renewed diversion of officers to protest duty this month makes it more difficult to follow up on shootings and maintain a street presence to try to head off gun violence.[84] Joe Biden Picks Kamala Harris as His 2020 Running Mate[85] Joe Biden has selected Kamala Harris to be his 2020 running mate, the former vice president announced Tuesday. 'I need someone working alongside me who is smart, tough, and ready to lead. Kamala is that person,' Biden said in a statement.[86] 'Looting is Reparations': BLM Protesters Gather Outside Chicago PD in Support of Looters Who Ransacked City Sunday Night, As Organizer Claims 'Anything They Wanted to Take, They Can Take Because These Businesses Have Insurance'[87] Black Lives Matter Chicago said early Monday's looting of stores was a form of 'reparations' as the group held a protest Monday night in support of the more than 100 people arrested after an evening of violence. Downtown Chicago was otherwise quiet after authorities cut off access, with drawbridges leading into the city pulled up and freeway exits blocked after riots sparked by a false rumor of a child shot by police. At least 13 police officers were injured as the violence claimed an estimated $65 million in property damage.[88] Man Shot by Secret Service Outside White House Claimed He Had Weapon, 'Ran Aggressively' Toward Officer, Withdrew Object From Clothing[89] The man who was shot just outside the White House Monday — causing President Trump to briefly be evacuated from an in-process press conference — told a Secret Service officer he had a weapon, then ran at him 'aggressively,' pulled an object from his clothing, and 'crouched into a shooter's stance as if about to fire a weapon' before being shot by the officer.[90] Neighbor Charges 5-Year-Old Boy Playing Outside, Puts Gun to His Head, And Executes Him[91] A North Carolina man on Sunday allegedly charged a 5-year-old boy who was playing in his neighborhood, put a gun to his head, and fatally shot the young child, according to local news.[92] New York Nursing Home Deaths Could be Undercounted[93] The death count among New York nursing homes could be severely undercounted, thanks to a policy that dictates only residents who die on nursing home property be counted as coronavirus deaths, according to a report by the Associated Press. Those who are transported to hospitals and died there are not counted as nursing home deaths.[94] Rep. Ocasio-Cortez Scheduled to Speak at DNC[95] New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is scheduled to speak at the virtual Democratic National Convention, organizers confirmed on Tuesday. The first-term congresswoman will speak next Tuesday, while Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), for whom Ocasio-Cortez served as a leading surrogate during his 2020 presidential campaign, will address the convention on Monday.[96] Seattle Police Chief Resigns After Being Defunded by Democrats[97] Seattle Police chief Carmen Best has thrown in the towel and resigned after the Democratic city council voted to cut millions from the police department's budget following demands to defund the police from Antifa rioters and Black Lives Matter agitators.[98] Seattle Business Owners Who Had Windows Smashed by BLM Say They Still Support BLM[99] Seattle business owners who have seen the windows of their premises repeatedly smashed by Black Lives Matter protesters assert that they still support the organization.

A weekend mass shooting that wounded 21 and killed one signaled a 45 percent increase in shootings in Washington, D.C., this year over the same period last year, including 46 shootings in the past week, the Washington Post reports. And New York City saw its 1,000th shooting victim of 2020 over the weekend, making this year's number of shootings and gun violence victims about equal to the previous two years combined, ABC7 reported.[108] 'We Will Not Prosecute': Left-Wing Prosecutors, Many Backed by Soros Cash, Implement Soft-on-Crime Policies Across America[109] Left-wing prosecutors have implemented soft-on-crime approaches to criminal justice across America, in some instances making it a matter of policy in major cities not to prosecute specific crimes, a Daily Caller News Foundation review found. A common, though not universal, feature of prominent left-wing district attorneys is the backing of political organizations funded by left-wing billionaire George Soros. The New York Times has creditedSoros with pioneering the 'push to overhaul prosecutors' offices' across the country. Cook County, Illinois, State's Attorney Kimberly Foxx, whose jurisdiction includes Chicago, took office in 2017 after winning her election with the help of a Soros-funded super PAC. Soros poured more than $400,000 into Illinois Justice &#38; Public Safety PAC in 2016, Illinois State Board of Elections records show. Foxx was the only candidate that the PAC supported in 2016, those records show. Foxx announced in December 2016, shortly before taking office, that her office wouldn't charge shoplifters with felonies unless they either had more than 10 previous felony convictions or if they stole more than $1,000 worth of goods, which was more than triple the previous felony threshold of $300.[110] Men With Chainsaws Attack Site of Anti-Lockdown Party at Toronto's Cherry Beach[111] When it comes to fighting for one's right to party, there's always got to be a buzz kill. Case in point: members of #YahooNation, as well as boys and girls who just want to have fun, turned their Queen's Park protest into an all-night party at Toronto's Cherry Beach last Saturday. It was quite the sight — the beach was transformed into an outdoor nightclub, complete with pulsating lights and music as everyone had a jolly good time. The Butabi brothers from A Night At The Roxbury would be proud. But on Sunday morning, two maniacs descended upon the beach with chainsaws?! Like, was Tobe Hooper filming another sequel to his most infamous film?[112] Police Officers Face Investigation After Posing With Anti-Mask Campaigner on Instagram[113] The Toronto police's Professional Standards Unit says it's investigating an Instagram photo featuring two of its officers posing with Chris Sky — one of Canada's biggest anti-mask campaigners. The photo was initially posted by Sky and then reportedly also posted to the police-affiliated TPS Neighbourhood Watch account with the hashtags #FreedomOfSpeech and #Advocate before being deleted, although police have yet to confirm this detail.[114] Authors, Comedians, And Actors Push Back Against Scotland's Authoritarian 'Hate Crime' Bill[115] Scotland is increasingly finding itself among those countries where draconian actions and reactions to what is perceived as hate speech are raising eyebrows among rights activists and freedom-loving people in general. Now, some star comedians and other artists are joining forces against the ruling SNP party's shocking Hate Crime and Public Order Bill. The bill is the work of Scottish Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf, who defends it as 'an important milestone in the fight against prejudice.' [Comment: Humza Yousaf doesn't seem like a Scottish name.][116] In Sweden, Where There Was No Lockdown, COVID Cases &#38; Deaths Have Slowed to a Trickle[117] Confounding claims by many that its open society approach to coronavirus would spectacularly backfire, Sweden, which didn't enforce any mandatory lockdown order, has seen its coronavirus cases and deaths slow to a trickle. Back in March, when Sweden announced that it would adopt a different approach to much of the rest of the world by refusing to shut down its economy and instead aim for herd immunity, public health experts and media commentators were aghast at the decision, warning that the country's hospitals would be overwhelmed with COVID victims.[118] UK May End Daily COVID-19 Death Reports After Experts Say Numbers Are Exaggerated[119] The United Kingdom is considering ending its daily COVID-19 death tracker after experts from Oxford University found that the total was exaggerated.

Some have asserted that this is evidence of Hezbollah 'tunnels' storing weapons at the Port of Beirut, while others think they were used for human trafficking. Both SkyNews and Russia's Sputnik News claimed there was a 'labyrinth network of tunnels.' The Lebanese Armed Forces have denied the existence of tunnels, just as Hezbollah has denied doing anything at Beirut Port.[122] Belarus Faces Internet Blackout as Protests Mount Over 'Sham' Election[123] New internet blackouts have occurred in Belarus after the victory of President Alexander Lukashenka, who would be repeating a term in office for the sixth time in a row after winning what his opponents have called a bogus election. According to the official results offered by Belarus's government, Mr. Alexander Lukashenka comfortably won the presidency with 80.3% of the votes during the elections held on August 10. In this way, Lukashenka achieves a record of six victories in a row in the presidential elections, a record he has kept since 1994. However, each election has passed in strange conditions that make it difficult to believe that they have been fair processes.[124] Experts Advise Caution as Russia Announces COVID-19 Vaccine for Public Use[125] Russian President Vladimir Putin announced Tuesday that his nation has developed and registered the first effective vaccine for protection against COVID-19. Putin insists the vaccine has gone through full testing and says it provides 'sustained immunity' against the novel coronavirus.[126] Protests in Minsk Orchestrated From Czechia, Poland, And the UK Claims Lukashenko[127] According to the recently reelected Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, extensive demonstrations in Minsk, which erupted on Sunday evening after the announcement of the results of the presidential election, were orchestrated by telephone calls from the Czech Republic, Poland, and the United Kingdom.

Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said 11 politicians and heads of civil organizations would be targeted for unspecified sanctions, including Senators Marco Rubio, Josh Hawley, Tom Cotton, Pat Toomey, and Ted Cruz, as well as Representative Chris Smith.[130] US Freezes Assets of Hong Kong Leaders, Chinese Officials[131] The United States on Friday announced sanctions against Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam and other senior officials for their role in curbing the city's promised freedoms, and in implementing a draconian national security regime. Announcing the sanctions, the State Department said that the Chinese Communist Party had made clear that Hong Kong would never again enjoy the high degree of autonomy promised under the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, and that the city will no longer be regarded as a separate jurisdiction from mainland China by the U.S. 'The United States will therefore take action against individuals who have crushed the Hong Kong people's freedoms,' it said in a statement on its official website.[132] Wuhan Lab Complains That it is Being Scapegoated for Coronavirus Spread[133] The director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology has complained that scientists at the facility are being made scapegoats in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

What we have now is one such case where an employee of the BP refinery in Australia was fired for taking a jibe at the company through a well-known Hitler meme online.

Earlier this month, a 'state of disaster' was declared in the state of Victoria, imposing an 8pm to 5am curfew on residents, some of whom have faced instances of police brutality for flouting the rules, including one woman who was put in a chokehold for not wearing a mask outside. The law is also being enforced via a series of checkpoints to determine if people have a legitimate reason to be traveling.[138] New Zealand Goes Into Lockdown After Just Four New Cases of Coronavirus[139] New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has ordered parts of the country to go into lockdown after just four new cases of coronavirus, the country's first in 102 days.

Immigration minister Chris Philp travelled to Paris on Tuesday to seek stronger enforcement measures — as Border Force continued to deal with crossings along the south coast of the UK. Mr Philp said that French authorities had caught 'well over a thousand' migrants making the crossing this year, but figures from January 2020 to August 6 show the total number to have made the trip to Britain in small boats is around 4,100.[146] Germany: Rape Cases in Berlin See Alarming Increase, Nearly Half of Suspects Are Migrants[147] Between March and the beginning of July 2020 alone, the Berlin police recorded 210 cases of 'collective or particularly humiliating rape'. In almost half of the cases, the criminal investigation agency says foreign suspects are responsible, Focus online reports. One perpetrator, 29-year-old Sinisa K. is said to have attacked women at eight different crime scenes in southwest Berlin and in the Potsdam area since June. The hunt for him lasted a month. He is said to have taken his victims by surprise in broad daylight with the same scam. Initially friendly, investigators later reported, the suspect gained their confidence, then he grabbed the women, dragged them into a bush and sexually assaulted them. During the eighth time, the alleged serial rapist was apprehended police in a forest in mid-July. The month-long manhunt for Sinisa K. made headlines nationwide.[148] Italy: Fed Up With PM Conte's Policy, Sicily Takes Immigration Control in Its Own Hands[149] Sicily's governor Nello Musumeci has had enough of the lax handling of the migrant crisis by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte's left-wing government and has taken matters into his own hands by issuing an ordinance tightening immigration rules on the island, conservative Hungarian daily Magyar Hirlap reports. The ordinance introduces stricter rules both for allowing migrant boats into Sicilian ports and the conditions under which migrants are allowed to remain on the island. Due to the rising number of new coronavirus cases, the ordinance also introduces stricter public health measures for the local population.[150] Migrants 'Revolt' Aboard Italian Coronavirus Quarantine Ship[151] Tensions are rising aboard the Italian ship Azzurra used to quarantine migrants for cases of coronavirus, as reports of protests and small revolts on the vessel have emerged.

Mayor Marvin Rees gave his support to a scheme which lets volunteers host refugees in their spare bedrooms — adding that the city should be a place 'where everyone feels welcome and safe'.

165,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1251/Files (250).DOCX","The New York Times",2020-06-05,"1136 words","Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 21","By Richard Fausset",NA,"Testimony of Racist Slur Escalates Arbery Case",FALSE,"A Georgia investigator testified that one of the three defendants accused of chasing down and killing Ahmaud Arbery heard another defendant use a racist slur.
ATLANTA -- A Georgia investigator testified on Thursday that one of the three white defendants accused of chasing down and killing Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was running in a South Georgia neighborhood, heard another defendant use a racist slur moments after firing the shotgun blasts that ended Mr. Arbery's life. 
 The explosive revelation, suggesting overt racism was at play in the case, came in a hearing in Brunswick, Ga., that ended with Judge Wallace E. Harrell of Glynn County Magistrate Court determining that sufficient probable cause existed to support the murder charges brought against the three men.
 There were several fiery moments in the hearing. At one point, after a lawyer for one defendant referred to the Book of Amos, the special prosecutor Jesse Evans cited another Bible verse.
 ''I've got one,'' he said. ''What about 'Love thy neighbor'?'' The three defendants, Mr. Evans said, had hunted down a ''defenseless'' man. ''He was tormented, he was hunted, he was targeted,'' Mr. Evans said.
 The hearing brought fresh attention to Mr. Arbery's case, one of several recent incidents of violence against black people that have convulsed much of the United States in sustained protest over racial inequities in the justice system. As significant details of Mr. Arbery's case were being revealed, a somber memorial service was being held in Minneapolis for George Floyd, a black man who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.
 A federal civil rights probe into Mr. Floyd's death was announced last Friday by Attorney General William P. Barr. Lawyers for Mr. Arbery's family have said that a federal civil rights probe into the Arbery case is also underway.
 In an interview on Thursday, L. Chris Stewart, the lawyer for Mr. Arbery's mother, said the revelation of the racist language should be enough to trigger indictments under the federal hate crimes statute.
 ''This is the proof they need to actually bring charges,'' he said.
 Outside the courthouse in Brunswick, protesters gathered to call for justice for Mr. Arbery. Inside, some of the participants wore masks to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
 The hearing largely focused on testimony from Richard Dial, an assistant special agent in charge for the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and the lead agent in the case. Mr. Dial said Travis McMichael, 34, who prosecutors say shot Mr. Arbery three times with a shotgun, was overheard using a racist epithet by William Bryan, a neighbor who has also been charged.
 Mr. Dial said Mr. Bryan was also involved in the pursuit and tried to stop Mr. Arbery with his vehicle several times.
 The chase began in the early afternoon of Feb. 23, when Mr. McMichael's father, Gregory McMichael, 64, saw Mr. Arbery running in the Satilla Shores neighborhood just outside of Brunswick, and suspected that Mr. Arbery was the perpetrator of a series of break-ins. Both the father and son armed themselves, got into a pickup truck and began chasing Mr. Arbery.
 The culmination of the chase was a physical fight between Mr. Arbery and Travis McMichael that was captured on video by Mr. Bryan, who pulled up to the scene in his truck. The video shows Mr. Arbery running toward the McMichaels before swerving around their pickup truck in an apparent effort to avoid Travis McMichael, who was standing outside with his shotgun.
 Then the two men clashed in front of the truck. Mr. Arbery was shot three times by Travis McMichael as Gregory McMichael watched from the truck bed.
 The elder McMichael, a retired investigator in the local district attorney's office, and his son, were arrested on May 7. Each was charged with murder and aggravated assault. Mr. Bryan was arrested on May 21 on charges of felony murder and criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment.
 The three men remain in Glynn County jail and have not entered a plea in the case. The McMichaels appeared in the courtroom via a video feed.
 Mr. Dial said that Travis McMichael had used racial epithets numerous times in past social media posts and text messages. Mr. Dial said that in one instance, Mr. McMichael, who runs a tour boat company, said he appreciated working on the water because there were no black people there. In another instance, Mr. Dial said that Mr. McMichael, responding to a video posted to social media, said it would have been better if someone had ''blown'' a black person's ''head off.''
 Mr. Dial also said that Mr. McMichael had a Confederate flag sticker on the toolbox of his truck. And he said that Mr. Bryan also used racial epithets in text messages unrelated to the shooting.
 Moments before he was chased, Mr. Arbery visited a house in the neighborhood that was under construction, as he had numerous times before. It remains unclear why he did so, but Mr. Dial said there was no evidence he stole anything. Mr. Dial also revealed, under questioning, that Mr. Arbery had a mental illness that caused him to have ''auditory hallucinations.'' He said Mr. Arbery was not being treated for that illness on the day he was killed.
 Much of Mr. Dial's time on the stand involved discussions about the minute details of the pursuit. Mr. Dial said that Mr. Bryan had stated to officials that Mr. Arbery was forced into a ditch as he tried to avoid Mr. Bryan's truck, and at one point appeared to try to open the passenger-side door after Mr. Bryan had used his truck to try to block Mr. Arbery's escape.
 Lawyers for all three men argued that the charges against their clients should be dropped. Mr. Bryan's lawyer, Kevin Gough, said it was impossible to show that his client knew that the McMichaels were ''acting wrongfully.'' Jason Sheffield, a lawyer for Travis McMichael, argued that his client was acting in self-defense after Mr. Arbery attacked him.
 Franklin Hogue, a lawyer for Gregory McMichael, said that while ''we might agree'' that his client leaving the house with a firearm ''may not have been a very good idea,'' he had a legitimate reason to want to ''intercept'' someone he thought may have committed a crime.
 The case has been handled by four district attorneys, and state investigators are looking into whether it was mishandled by the first two of them, Jackie Johnson of Brunswick, and George E. Barnhill of Waycross, Ga. Mr. Barnhill, soon after the shooting, advised local police that probable cause did not exist to charge anyone in the case, and no one was arrested for weeks.
 Andrea Young, executive director of the A.C.L.U. of Georgia, said in a statement on Thursday that the hearing showed that the two prosecutors were ''unfit for their offices,'' and called on them to resign.

You have sucked their blood. You are not real Jews, those of you that are not real Jews. You are the synagogue of Satan, and you have wrapped your tentacles around the U.S. government, and you are deceiving and sending this nation to hell.' 
—Louis Farrakhan One thing irresponsible actors on both sides of the political spectrum now agree on—perhaps the only thing—is that the medieval bigot Louis Farrakhan and his followers are serious people who 'represent' or can 'speak for' black America. And the poison is spreading. It is being spread by Donald Trump, now partnering with rapper and Farrakhan fan Ice Cube, who enjoys tweeting anti-Semitic memes and images, like one depicting Jewish bankers seated around a Monopoly board resting on the backs of Black men. It is being spread by Barack Obama, headlining an event with the discredited Women's March leader and Farrakhan acolyte Tamika Mallory. And it is being spread by the editors of The New York Times, who this weekend ran a fawning op-ed about the women behind Farrakhan's Million Man March without so much as a nod to his overt and grotesque bigotry--which led the late John Lewis to boycott the event. When Jewish readers expressed anguish at this whitewashing, the author of the piece took to Twitter to tell them to stop 'centering' themselves in this conversation. Can you imagine that being said by a contributor to the Times to any other minority group targeted for violence? And in the very year when there was a mass murder of Jews perpetrated by someone driven by the ideas that Farrakhan promotes? The normalizing of America's leading conspiratorial anti-Semite by both parties, in the hope of bringing out more African American voters, is one more symptom of the deeply corrosive and morally repulsive politics that has trashed the American liberal tradition. It makes a mockery of the left's flood of outrage over Donald Trump's failure to forcefully denounce white supremacists, while Trump's courting of one of Farrakhan's outspoken fans, reportedly through the good offices of his son-in-law Jared Kushner, makes a mockery of the idea that he is a bulwark against Jew-haters on the progressive left. As for The New York Times, we look forward to the forthcoming magazine issue devoted to explaining that Farrakhan, and not Martin Luther King Jr., was actually the lead character in the fight for racial justice in America, in a series of essays to be given out next year in public schools.The Case Against The New York Times[2]In familiar laceration mode, the Editorial Board of The New York Times Sunday Review recently (October 18) offered 'The Case Against Donald Trump.' Page one (of nine) presented the editors' indictment litany, familiar to any Times reader: 'Lies Anger Corruption Incompetence Chaos Decay.' Columnists cited Trump's 'Unapologetic Corruption,' 'Demagogy' and 'Fake Populism,' while the editors mourned 'A Nation Adrift' amid 'An Economy in Tatters,' 'A Planet in Peril' and 'Women's Rights Under Attack.' So what else is new at the Times? One journalist who contributed to the tirade caught my attention: Serge Schmemann, who had become the Times Jerusalem Bureau Chief shortly before the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in November 1995. Among President Trump's claimed successes, 'dubious at best and illusory at worst,' he wrote, was its Middle East peace plan. For Schmemann it was nothing more than 'a bag of gifts for the Israeli right, effectively undermining America's potential as a mediator with the Palestinians.' His familiar expression of the Times party line about Israel prompted a review of Schmemann's coverage of Israel in the mid-1990s. He preposterously blamed Rabin's assassination on 'the bellicose settlers of Hebron' — a favorite Times trope — who 'spew the violent religious ideology that fired Yigal Amir,' Rabin's assassin. But Amir, who grew up in the town of Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv, was not a settler nor did he live in Hebron. Schmemann was most detached and moderate when reporting Palestinian terrorist attacks. Following the massacre by a suicide bomber that killed 26 Israeli passengers on a Jerusalem bus, he mentioned 'Israeli rage and grief' but focused on Prime Minister Shimon Peres' 'tough tone' in a Knesset speech. 'In the fury of the moment,' Schmemann wrote, Israelis 'reverted to their basic instinct: that war against terrorism must be constant and total' — rather, presumably, than occasional and minimal.Tom Gross: Conversations with friends: New York Times columnist Bret Stephens Bret Stephens, a Pulitzer Prize winning columnist for the NY Times and before that the Wall St Journal, talks about his upbringing in Mexico, his family background in Europe, and becoming a journalist. Bret and Tom Gross discuss America's place in the world, the ongoing 'culture wars' in the US, the pitfalls of Donald Trump's presidency (but whether it is dangerous for some to suggest he's a 'fascist' or 'Nazi'), what Trump has got wrong but what he may have got right regarding China, the Mideast and the Balkans, and Bret's own role at the New York Times, and the Times' role in the world. Play Video[3]https://www.mrdrybones.com/blog/D20A20_1.png Antisemitism? Here's how to fight back[4]As Alan Dershowitz writes in his classic book The Case for Israel, 'A good working definition of anti-Semitism is taking a trait or an action that is widespread, if not universal, and blaming only the Jews for it. That is what Hitler and Stalin did, and that is what former Harvard University president A. Lawrence Lowell did in the 1920s when he tried to limit the number of Jews admitted to Harvard because 'Jews cheat.' When a distinguished alumnus objected on the grounds that non-Jews also cheat, Lowell replied, 'You're changing the subject. I'm talking about Jews.'' That's exactly what the synagogue picketers are doing. Like Lowell pretended to care about cheating, but only cared about Jewish cheating, so Hirskovitz and Co. pretend to be for 'human rights,' and to care for Arabs killed in conflicts, but, in fact, they only care about Arabs who are killed by Jews. It's not about Arab lives. It's not about justice. It's about Jewish behavior. (And it's certainly not about what Arab terrorists do to Jewish civilians, ed.) According to the vehemently anti-Israel NGO B'Tzelem, in the 27 years between 1987 (the First 'Intifadah') and 2014 (Operation Protective Edge), Israeli counter-terrorism measures killed a grand total of 8,441 Palestinians. But in only nine years (2011 - 2020), Arabs killed 586,100 Arabs in the Syrian Civil War, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights' report. Hirskovitz and Company were nowhere to be seen. Nor have they likely been writing about the grand slaughters of the last century, like those in the Soviet Empire (at least 20 million) and Mo's China (perhaps 65 million). For him and his kind, only Israeli behavior — and it's microscopic 'massacres' — count. The same disproportionate concern with Jewish conduct and its concomitant erasure of truly horrid crimes in Israel's neighborhood and beyond can be endlessly extended. So let us turn the tables. My organization, Americans for Peace and Tolerance, developed a way to counter such lies by moving the spotlight from fantasies of Israeli evil to the hideous human rights atrocities which appear not to really trouble this world's Henry Hirskovitzs. We produced a series of meme posters highlighting the moral hypocrisy of anti-Israel arguments, particularly those of the BDS movement. They can be downloaded here, or directly and in full resolution from our website[5].Israeli Oppression Comes to Durham[6]For Mayor Schewel and his fellow Democratic Party members, though, the incident brought additional outside support for their political ambitions—much of it from Jews. Over the past 13 months, some $266,000 has poured into the Democratic Party platform campaigns. For State Attorney General Josh Stein—who was once a partner in a firm with JVP chapter leader Tom Stern—some 30% of his campaign support has come from donors outside of North Carolina, including $5,400 from George Soros and 290 donations from individuals in California, where JVP is based. The rapid political progress in Durham has likewise attracted repeat marquee visits from BDS activist Linda Sarsour, who shared the city council's misprisioned understanding of the Israeli law enforcement programs when she said elsewhere that American police are sent to be trained by 'Israeli police and military, and then they come back here and do what? Stop and frisk, killing unarmed Black people across the country.' After Sarsour's keynote last February at a UNC Chapel Hill public health conference—where Sarsour, who has no medical background, weighed in on the public health issues of the day by explaining that 'I believe and I support the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement'—she was brought back to give a $9,000 main address focusing on intersectionality and activism at a women's history month Courageous Conversations event. Wolf, Friedman, and others in the Durham community filed what would total three lawsuits against the city and leadership for both discrimination and violations of public records laws for using personal email accounts to communicate about the resolution before it was debated publicly. Two of those suits were eventually dismissed, and the third is now pending in a federal appeals court. 'In my view, making these sorts of announcements is discriminatory and illegal. However, it's very difficult to get a court to agree to that,' David Abrams, a lawyer who represented one of the dismissed suits, told me. 'If a town announced that we're no longer hiring people of race X for position Y, and then it turns out that later they say, 'well, we weren't going to hire anyone for position Y,' I don't think a court would have a problem saying that the announcement itself is unlawful. It just seems that with Israel, people don't take discrimination quite as seriously.' In March, following the passage of the resolution, there was perhaps some indication that courts might wish to take anti-Semitic hate and its connection to passing purely speculative resolutions targeting the world's only Jewish state more seriously. At a conference in Durham hosted by the Duke-UNC Middle East Consortium, a rapper named Tamer Nafar opened the performance of his song, 'Mama, I Fell in Love with a Jew' and asked for assistance from the energized crowd. 'This is my anti-Semitic song I know it sounds like R&#38;B stuff, but don't think of Rihanna when you sing it,' Nafar said. 'Think of Mel Gibson Go that anti-Semitic Let's try it together. I need your help. I can't be anti-Semitic alone.' A video of the performance posted online led to outrage in some quarters of Durham. Others took a blithe view of the incident, including a UNC professor and adviser for JVP who challenged the logic of how someone could be anti-Semitic if they openly announced themselves to be anti-Semitic. 'If your song is anti-Semitic, you're not going to say that,' Eyse Crystall told one reporter. 'The song was about being in love with a Jewish woman.' Looking back since the passage of the resolution, Katherine Wolf told me that she anticipated the template used to pass the resolution in Durham would be implemented in progressive strongholds. 'People think Durham is an isolated case. Actually, we're the canary in the coal mine.' For Deborah Friedman, the whole encounter with JVP and the institutions which rallied around them ultimately left her feeling unsure of her place in her own city. 'You raise your kids here, they go to school in Durham, and you think you're welcomed in the community. And you're not. It really felt like the Invasion of the Body Snatchers, you suddenly don't know who your friends are anymore,' she said. 'They don't care if they're lying, or what they need to do. They just want to take their big old intersectional measuring stick and whack you over the head with it.'Bethany Mandel: Andrew Cuomo's anti-Semitism and science denial collide in Jewish school closures[7]The map of Gov. Andrew Cuomo's shutdown in Brooklyn can be perfectly correlated to the Orthodox Jewish community in the borough, and that is by design. In a video appearance, the governor has pegged spiking cases on the shoulders of only one community within the city: Orthodox Jews, and he linked the surge in the virus to the religious practices of Orthodox Judaism. In a public address, Cuomo explained, ""We're now having issues in the Orthodox Jewish community in New York, where, because of their religious practices, we're seeing a spread.' Through words and actions, the governor has shown that he views Jews as vectors of disease, and his mitigation strategy for the virus rests on shutting down the religious practices of Orthodox Jews. Infection rates in the area are going up, and so the governor has decided to shut the entire area down: schools, stores, etc. Despite the fact that retail and education have not been tied to these spikes in cases (which have not resulted in nearly the numbers of hospitalizations and deaths we saw in the spring), the state punitively took action against only one entire area, those populated by Orthodox Jews, locking it down in its entirety. In a recently released half-hour audio clip of a private phone conversation between Cuomo and rabbis in the community, we hear Cuomo say this: 'I didn't propose this, it was proposed by [Mayor Bill de Blasio] in the city. I'm trying to sharpen this and make it better. But it's out of fear. People see the numbers going up and close everything, close everything. It's not the best way to do it. It is a fear-driven response. The virus scares people. Hopefully, we get the numbers down in the ZIP codes, the anxiety comes down, and we can have a smarter, more tailored approach. Your point is right; why close every school? Why don't you test the schools and close the ones that have a problem? I know. But, first, I don't know if we have the resources to do that now. But I can tell you honestly, the fear is too high to do anything other than let's do everything we can to get the infection rate down now; close the doors, and close the windows.' On Friday, it was announced that a school in Brooklyn, Bais Yaakov Ateres Miriam, decided to push back against this fear-based response by the governor and demand its right to reopen safely, filing a lawsuit with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty. The complaint on behalf of the Bais Yaakov school with the District Court for the Northern District of New York tasks the court to allow the school to reopen immediately and is the first of its kind, but should hardly be the last. In its briefing to the court, the Becket Fund explains, 'Fear is not a compelling government interest, and—even in a pandemic—constitutional rights deserve better than a hatchet job. That is particularly true where the government admits public health is not in jeopardy.' Despite the rising infection rate and the reopening of the school at the beginning of the year, the school has seen zero cases of the virus among its students or staff. The school has proven its ability to operate safely, and Becket is rightly fighting for it to continue to do so.

The bumbling reporter is played by Jewish comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, who is promoting the sequel to his 2006 hit film. The character was known for being wildly anti-Semitic — more as a way of exposing and lampooning entrenched bigotry in American society than as commentary on Kazakhstan. Baron Cohen, appearing on 'Jimmy Kimmel Live,' opened the show by spraying disinfectant across the set and saying that his country's intelligence services 'have make discovery this morning that there is a virus. 'It come from a place called Wuhan, which is in Israel. There is no surprise. They are spreading everything,' Baron Cohen said. 'It spread from the you-know-whos,' he added, simulating a big nose with his hand. He administered a 'normal Kazakh plague questionnaire' to Kimmel, which opened with the question, 'In the last week have you been in the presence of more than 15 minutes of any Jews?' He also asked if Kimmel, 'as a member Hollywood elite,' had recently drunk any 'unpasteurized children's blood' — a reference to anti-Semitic blood libels against Jews. Seth Frantzman: French teacher's murder brings media terminology into spotlight - analysis[15]The problem with this coverage is that it would be like telling the story of lynchings in the US South by the KKK as a series of 'extremists' killing 'random people.' For instance, the 2015 attack on the kosher market in Paris was described by US president Barack Obama as 'a bunch of violent, vicious zealots who behead people or randomly shoot a bunch of folks in a deli in Paris.' But it wasn't random. Terming the systematic murder of African-Americans by the KKK as 'random' would miss the nature of the terror campaign being conducted. The KKK sought out specific targets to spread fear, not just random people. The same methodology tends to underpin killings like the murder of the teacher. This leads to questions about whether calling the KKK 'violent extremists' would be better than reporting more narrowly on its white supremacist motivations. 'Religious supremacist' is a term rarely, if ever, used to describe the terror attacks in places like France, but at the root of beheadings is a form of far-right, religious, supremacist attacks. Re-focusing the attacks on the outcome, such as police shooting the perpetrator, tends to move the focus to the perpetrator rather than the victim and leave behind questions of motive and worldview. Twenty years after the US declared a global war on terror, governments and the media still struggle with how to define these kinds of attacks. Brendan O'Neill: The silence of the anti-fascists[16]Anti-fascists are incredibly quiet about the fascist in France who cut off a man's head because he displayed some cartoons in a classroom. It is two days since the gruesome Islamist murder of schoolteacher Samuel Paty for the supposed crime of showing caricatures of Muhammad to his pupils during a classroom discussion about freedom of speech. And yet the self-styled anti-fascists of the European and American left have said barely a word. There have been no big protests outside of France, no angry rallies, no Twitterstorms, no knee-taking or fist-raising, no promises by 'Antifa' to face down these extremists who slaughter schoolteachers for talking about liberty. Their craven, cowardly silence is as revealing as it is depressing. After every Islamist terror attack, we hear the same thing from significant sections of the Western left, including those who style themselves as anti-fascist. Their first concern is always, but always, that an Islamist terror attack might give rise to an 'Islamophobic' backlash. We have to be careful about how we talk about Islamist terrorism, they say, or we might help to make Muslim communities into targets for racist violence. This is such a morally warped response to the extremist violence of radical Islamists. Imagine if, following an act of far-right violence carried out by a white man, someone said 'Let's not get too angry about this because we might alienate white people and put them at risk'. Imagine if, in the wake of the terrorist attacks by Anders Breivik in Norway or Brenton Tarrant in New Zealand, people's first response was to wonder if white people would be okay, if white men were feeling safe. That is how crazy leftists sound when their Pavlovian response to the mass murder of children in Manchester or the slaughter of Bastille Day celebrants in Nice or the mowing down of Christmas shoppers in Berlin is to say: 'I hope Muslims will be okay.' Their instinct is always to hush and chill discussion of radical Islam. They have developed numerous strategies for doing this. The first, as described above, is to imply that there could be violence against Muslims if we get too angry or heated about an Islamist attack - a form of moral blackmail designed to stymie frank discussion of Islamist violence. Another is to promiscuously deploy the insult of 'Islamophobe' against anybody who raises awkward questions about the frequency and bloodiness of Islamist attacks in Europe, or who even uses that i-word at all (Islamist) to describe these acts of violence.Paris Mosque Apologises For Sharing 'Fatwa' Video Prior to Islamic Beheading Attack[17]A mosque in Paris has apologised for sharing a video from a parent who called for a 'mobilisation' campaign against Samuel Paty, a teacher who was beheaded after showing his class a caricature of the Islamic prophet Mohammed shortly afterwards. On Sunday, the leader of the Pantin mosque in Paris, M'hammed Henniche, admitted to sharing the video, which detailed the terror victim's identity and address. Following the dissemination of the video, Paty was beheaded in an Islamic attack believed to have been committed by 18-year-old Chechen migrant Abdoulakh Anzorov. 'In hindsight, given what happened we regret having published it. We are now exploring how in the future we can take a step back before getting carried away with things like that,' the mosque leader said per FranceTVInfo. 'Nobody, really nobody, could imagine, on October 9 when I posted it, that it would end with this killing,' he added. Henniche claimed that the video was widely shared through Muslim circles in the city, telling the French newspaper Libration: 'At least ten people sent it to me. It circulated a lot, especially through WhatsApp groups.' Following the Islamic attack, the mosque deleted the video from its Facebook page and called for its members to join tribute rallies for the victim.Sheikh Ali Al-Yousuf: Killing of French Teacher Paty Was in Keeping with the Ruling of the Shari'a Play Video[18] Qatari Sociologist Abd Al-Aziz Al-Khazraj Al-Ansari: Samuel Paty's Murder May Have Been Orchestrated Like 9/11; Killings, Stabbings Are Normal Reactions to Insults against the Prophet Muhammad pic.twitter.com/hGTSDDsTVJ[19] — MEMRI (@MEMRIReports) October 20, 2020[20] Outspoken union leader Len McCluskey, who repeatedly downplayed antisemitism in Labour, apologises for saying a Jewish politician should 'go into a room and count his gold'[21]The outspoken Unite union leader, Len McCluskey, who has repeatedly downplayed antisemitism in the Labour Party, has apologised after saying that a Jewish politician should 'go into a room and count his gold'. Mr McCluskey made the comment about Lord Mandelson, a New Labour grandee and former minister, in an interview with the BBC. Told that Lord Mandelson had praised the new Leader of the Labour Party, Mr McCluskey told Newsnight: 'I stopped listening to what Peter Mandelson said [sic] many, many years ago. I suggest that Peter just goes into a room and counts his gold, not worry about what's happening in the Labour Party - leave that to those of us who are interested in ordinary working people.' Lord Mandelson has made no secret of his Jewish heritage in the past. His grandfather founded the Harrow United Synagogue and his father worked at the JC. Lord Mandelson said in 2010: 'It's not that I am religious. It's the extended family, which part of me wants to be part of.' The notion that Jews are rich and self-interested is an age-old antisemitic trope. Unite defended Mr McCluskey's remark, reportedly saying in a statement: 'Mr Mandelson's religion was not relevant to the comments made by Mr McCluskey. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge Mr Mandelson is not Jewish. The ordinary meaning of the statement made by Mr McCluskey is one of his belief that in recent years Mr Mandelson has had more interest in increasing his own wealth than in fighting for social justice for working class people. The suggestion of any antisemitic meaning to the commentary would be ludicrous.' However, late last night, Mr McCluskey tweeted: 'Before this gets out of hand, let me say language is important and I apologise to Peter Mandelson and anyone else if mine has caused hurt.'

Asked to comment on his response to the long-awaited Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) report the former Mayor of London told the JC: 'I haven't objected to it. I haven't seen it.' Organisations and individuals which could be facing criticism in the report into Labour's handling of antisemitism were sent draft copies in July. The process - which saw the Labour Party confirming they had received a draft version -allowed them 28 days to mount any challenge to claims made within the document. Mr Livingstone also told the JC he believed he had been subjected to ""lies and smears' ever since he was first elected leader of the Greater London Council in 1981. He said: 'I've been accused of being corrupt, alcoholic...violent . 'I've had 39 years of lies and smears. Don't worry about it.' Mr Livingstone resigned from Labour after 50 years in May 2018 saying the issues around antisemitism had become a distraction. He had been suspended since 2016 over comments relating to Adolf Hitler and Zionism. SWU urges denial of Zoom platform for Leila Khaled[25]StandWithUs, the pro-Israel organization that opposes anti-Semitic and anti-Zionist activities on college campuses, has written to Zoom Video Communications urging the company to deny a platform to airline hijacker Leila Khaled when she is scheduled to address students on Friday, Oct. 23, at the University of Hawaii. Zoom previously denied its platform to Khaled when she was scheduled to address students at San Francisco State University. StandWithUs (SWU) released a copy of its letter to Eric S. Yuan, founder and CEO of Zoom Video Communications, and also informed David Lasser, president of the University of Hawaii, of its strong objections to the event. Below is a copy of the SWU letter that was sent to Yuan: Dear Mr. Yuan, We write on behalf of the StandWithUs Saidoff Legal Department and the StandWithUs Center for Combating Antisemitism, two divisions of StandWithUs, an international non-profit Israel education organization, concerning an upcoming Zoom event featuring convicted terrorist Leila Khaled. Ms. Khaled is apparently scheduled to speak through Zoom at an event at the University of Hawaii this upcoming Friday, October 23, 2020. According to the Facebook post, the purpose of the event is 'to protest the lockstep censorship by Facebook, Zoom, YouTube, and SFSU of an Open Classroom featuring Leila Khaled. This webinar explores—and refuses!— the use of the label 'terrorism' to censor political speech and criminalize resistance.' In light of Khaled's membership in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a U.S. State Department-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, and, more importantly, her terrorism convictions in connection with the 1969 hijacking of TWA Flight 840 and the 1970 hijacking of El Al Flight 219, we ask that you immediately take all necessary steps to ensure that a convicted terrorist not receive a platform on Zoom.Boycotts only divide people and spread disunity and discrimination.

To provide another comparison: The total death toll in the nine year Syria Civil War is believed to be over 400,000. In Yemen, six years of war have claimed over 230,000 lives. The number of Arabs (including Palestinians) killed in conflict over the last 100 years is around 91,000. (25,000 Jews were killed during that time period) If you look at the past year, a total of 133 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces - a number (reported by the anti-Israel NGO B'tselem) which includes Palestinians slain whilst carrying out terror attacks, or in some way involved in hostilities (nearly half of the total number). Using another metric of suffering, governments' violations of their citizens' human rights, the human rights organisation Freedom House lists, as the countries with the worst overall scores for political rights and civil liberties: Syria, Eritria, South Sudan, Turkmenistan, North Korea, Equatorial Guinea, Saudi Arabia, Libya, Somalia and Tajikistan. By contrast, Freedom House ranks Israel as the best country in the Middle East on political and civil rights. For the Indy journalist to assert that the collective suffering of the Palestinians is even in the same moral universe as that of the Uighurs suggests either profound malice or, more likely, a staggering level of ignorance.The BLM Movement and Antisemitism[38]On Aug. 28, a full-page advertisement was published in The New York Times to endorse Black Lives Matter. Claiming to represent 'the majority of American Jews,' the ad not only proclaimed support for the 'Black Lives Matter' message - the pursuit of racial justice, freedom and safety for Blacks - which the vast majority of American Jewish communities strongly support, but for the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement - a framework encompassing different entities about which many American Jews are more apprehensive. The ad celebrated the larger movement as America's 'current day Civil Rights Movement' and the 'best chance at equity and justice.' Spearheaded by radical-left and pro-BDS groups like Bend the Arc and Jewish Voice for Peace, the ad purported to represent Jewish organizations from across the spectrum 'speaking in one voice' to support the BLM movement. It also implicitly attacked those voicing concern about the movement's antisemitism by suggesting they were racists and white supremacists who were 'pointing fingers, scapegoating, and using antisemitic dogwhistles' in order to undermine Black-led movements. The advertisement thus provoked anger and anxiety within the American Jewish community. What is the Controversy Over the Movement?The controversy about the BLM movement - in contrast to the cause - began years earlier, when movement leaders came out in support of the antisemitic BDS movement following a junket to 'Palestine' organized by one of the BLM-affiliated groups called Dream Defenders that brought black activists to Israel and the West Bank to meet with BDS co-founder Omar Barghouti and other radical anti-Israel activists and militants. Among them was the BLM movement co-founder, Patrisse Cullors. The December 2014 trip was the first of several such trips organized by Dream Defenders, a group founded by three alumni of Florida state universities in Tallahassee in reaction to the killing in Florida of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, following a physical altercation. Although the group's co-founders were initially focused on repealing Florida's 'Stand Your Ground' Law which they believed resulted in Martin's killing and Zimmerman's acquittal, the mission quickly expanded. One of the co-founders of the group was a Palestinian-American activist by the name of Ahmad Abuznaid whose own focus was to create a nexus between Palestinian grievances and those of African Americans and to link the emerging BLM movement with BDS. In April 2014, Abuznaid spoke at an event sponsored by the BDS group, Students for Justice in Palestine, at his alma mater. His topic was 'The Freedom Struggle From Florida to Palestine: A Look at Racial Oppression in America and Israel.'Telegraph promotes myth of daily violence by 'marauding' settlers[39]So, where did the Telegraph get the 400 figure from? Well, Reuters published a similar story a week ago ('Palestinian village installs cameras, accusing Israeli settlers of attacks', Oct. 7), which quoted Ali Faraj, co-founder of the Palestinian camera project highlighted in the Oct. 19th Telegraph article, claiming more than 450 such incidents. So, the 400+ figure appears to be nothing more than an unsubstantiated Palestinian claim. To be fair, there is a lot of tree vandalism in the West Bank by settlers, with thousands of trees vandalized, per the UN database, yearly. But, physical violence is of course not the same thing as vandalism, which is an important distinction given that the article uses wording ('they are attacking us', Palestinians have been 'beaten') suggesting daily occurrences of the former. We've been in touch with the Telegraph, and asked that they either provide a credible source for the 400 figure, or clarify to readers that it's merely an unverified Palestinian claim.Over 1.7 million anti-Semitic posts seen on Facebook, Twitter so far in 2020[40]A combination of a recent Holocaust survivors' campaign, as well as a shocking US study that showed a serious lack of knowledge among so-called Generation Z, 48% of whom could not name a single concentration camp., has prompted social media giants Facebook and Twitter to announce last week that both platforms will ban posts denying the Holocaust, in line with their respective rules on violating hateful conduct policy. While this is a very important step, US Special Envoy for Monitoring and Combating Anti-Semitism Elan Carr argues that social media is rife with ""raw hate"" against Jews and will probably remain as such in the foreseeable future. Carr, who was named as the Trump administration's special envoy on anti-Semitism in February 2019, told JNS that there is only so much that the federal government can do to curb online posts. ""Obviously, a portion of online anti-Semitism rises to the level of crime, and, of course, that should be addressed and addressed aggressively. But the vast majority of online hate is protected by the First Amendment, so the government can't go after protected speech nor should it,"" he said. Asked whether a free-market approach could better combat anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism on social-media sites, Carr said, ""Competition is always a good thing, and certainly, the government has expressed that view specifically in the context of the social-media platforms. ""At the end of the day, you've got some bad actors who are spouting hate on the Internet. One can decide to regulate this or that platform, but at the end of the day, we've got to go to the source of the problem. The source of the problem is people hold despicable views. The First Amendment protects despicable views, but it doesn't mean we can't condemn them or call them out. I think that is absolutely critical.Swastikas are not antisemitic, according to Paris criminal court[41]After more than 20 red Swastikas were spray-painted all along rue de Rivoli in the center of Paris, the Criminal Court, surprisingly, didn't, retain the ""antisemitic character"" of the act. A 31-year-old man from Georgia was arrested at the scene on October 11 on suspicion of spray-painting the swastikas. He will be judged on November 18 by the court for ""refusal of signaling"" and ""degradation of classified property"" but ""the antisemitic character"" of the alleged act was denied and not retained by the court. This decision was strongly denounced by the International League Against Racism and Antisemitism (LICRA). ""Something is not right in the functioning of justice. The Minister of the Interior himself denounces the tags as Nazi's, but the prosecution does not retain any aggravating circumstances in the matter, considering that swastikas are not Nazi,"" LICRA declared in a tweet. According to the Paris prosecutor's office, it is not legally possible to retain the aggravating circumstance of the commission of acts due to religion, insofar as these degradations have been committed without specifically targeting buildings identified as linked to the Jewish community. Tagged in red on the columns of the arcades of the rue de Rivoli, the swastikas were visible early Sunday morning in photos posted on social networks.San Diego Cops Arrest 14-Year-Old Boy for Antisemitic Assault on Rabbi[42]A San Diego teenage boy was arrested by police last Friday in connection with a violent assault on a rabbi in the University City neighborhood the previous weekend. The 14-year-old was booked into Juvenile Hall on battery and hate crime charges, San Diego Police Lt. Shawn Takeuchi said. On the previous Saturday, Oct. 10, the teen was alleged to have punched Rabbi Yonatan Halevy of the Shiviti Congregation to the ground as he walked to synagogue with his father for Shabbat services. Halevy explained that the teen had ridden past him on a bike, and then abruptly turned and punched him in the face. After regaling the rabbi with insults and a reference to 'white power,' he rode off laughing, Halevy told The San Diego Union-Tribune. 'I was shocked, stunned, and hurt, but was grateful that my father was unharmed,' the rabbi recalled. Halevy said that the synagogue had been targeted by a group of teens, including the alleged assailant, for a few weeks before the attack. They had been heckled and a car window was broken, he said. Even before the attack on Halevy, the Anti-Defamation League's regional director had highlighted the problems faced by the synagogue. 'We don't want to be dismissive and say it was just kids,' the ADL's Tammy Gillies said. 'We have to take hate and any hate incident very seriously.'Canadian human rights executive posts antisemitic meme of 'Jewish' octopus with tentacles wrapped around Congress[43]A Director of a Canadian human rights group has posted a virulently antisemitic meme and antisemitic text on Facebook and Twitter, according to a report. Aliya Hasan, also known as Aliyawa Jamal Hasan, a Director of Canadian Defenders for Human Rights (CD4HR), uploaded a post to Facebook on 14th October featuring an octopus with a Star of David symbol and a letter 'Z' (for Zionist) on its head and its tentacles wrapped around the Capitol building. Each tentacle bore the initials of a Jewish organisation. The caption read: 'Dear Americans, Sorry to break it to you, but America is under occupation and Biden and the Democrats won't change that. Sincerely, The rest of the sane world.' Commenting on her own post, Ms Hasan wrote: 'I'll be getting blocked by some more diehard dems [Democrats] soon.' She accompanied her post with 'sad-face' and 'crying' emojis. She added, 'Just letting the trash take itself out,' with a series of 'laughing' and 'crying with laughter' emojis. On October 14, 2020 Hasan tweeted: 'Dear Americans, Sorry to break it to you, but America is under occupation and #Biden and the #Democrats won't change that. Sincerely, The rest of the sane world.' She attached the same antisemitic meme of an octopus with its tentacles wrapped around America's seat of government. The notions of the Jews as excessively powerful - often illustrated through tentacles imagery - and parasitic are common antisemitic themes.Jewish cemeteries, Holocaust memorial desecrated in Greece[44]Several Jewish cemeteries and a Holocaust memorial have been desecrated in Greece, the country's Jewish council said Monday, just days after neo-Nazi leaders were jailed in a landmark trial. A graffito saying, 'With Jews you lose,' was sprayed Friday onto a monument dedicated to the 50,000 Jews of Thessaloniki in northern Greece exterminated during the Holocaust, the Central Board of Jewish Communities in Greece (KIS) said in a statement. The words 'Death to Israel' were also discovered at the Jewish cemetery of Thessaloniki, while four tombs were vandalized in the Jewish cemetery on Rhodes island in the southeast. The acts of vandalism come after the leader of Greece's neo-Nazi party Golden Dawn and his inner circle were handed 13-year prison sentences on Wednesday. The sentences represented a major downfall for a party that had been the country's third most popular in 2015 when the trial began. European Jewish Group Slams Munich Auction House for Selling Nazi Memorabilia[45]An auction house in Munich, Germany, has again come under fire for selling Nazi memorabilia, this time including various speaking notes from Adolf Hitler. The chairman of the European Jewish Association (EJA), Rabbi Menachem Margolin, said he couldn't get his 'head around the sheer irresponsibility and insensitivity' of selling such items to the highest bidder. Hermann Historica was criticized in November 2019 for a similar auction. The lots ended up being bought by a Lebanese businessman, Abdallah Chatila, who then donated them to Yad Vashem to do with as they saw fit. Following the fallout of the last auction, the EJA has been pushing European lawmakers to ban the sale of Nazi memorabilia as part of an overall plan to tackle antisemitism across the continent. 'It defies logic, decency and humanity for the very same auction house that came under fire less than a year ago for selling disgusting lots of Nazi memorabilia that they should do so again,' said Margolin in a statement. 'What auctions like this do help legitimize Hitler enthusiasts who thrive on this sort of stuff.' Margolin called for the auction to be stopped and for the German government to intervene.A-star student who fell down 'rabbit hole of internet' to become neo-Nazi pleads guilty to terror charges[46]An A-star student said to have fallen down 'the rabbit hole of the internet' to become a neo-Nazi has pleaded guilty to fourteen terror charges. Harry Vaughan, who is eighteen, is said to have begun taking an interest in Satanic neo-Nazism at the age of fourteen, unbeknownst to his parents, who were bewildered when he was arrested some years later. He had 'every advantage that could have been afforded to him,' according to his barrister, having been educated at a prestigious grammar school and received four A-star grades in summer exams. In 2018, he applied to join the System Resistance Network, a white supremacist successor to National Action, which the Government proscribed as a terrorist organisation in 2016 following a long campaign by Campaign Against Antisemitism and others. He wrote at the time that 'there is nothing I wouldn't do to further the cause'. He was arrested at home on 19th June last year in a counter-terrorism operation against a far-right online forum called Fascist Forge. His laptop was seized, revealing documents relating to antisemitism, Satanism and neo-Nazism, as well as as far-right terrorist book, bomb-making manuals and materials from the Sonnenkrieg Division, a neo-Nazi organisation that was proscribed by the Government this year. Police also discovered videos of child abuse, which also led to charges to which Mr Vaughan has pleaded guilty.Nazi banner draped out of window in Stoke-On-Trent[47]A Nazi banner was seen draped out of a first floor window in a house in Stoke-On-Trent. The banner in Birches Head was publicised on social media, where police announced that it was being investigated. This is not the first time that a Nazi flag has appeared in the area. In 2017, a trader was suspended from a town market after displaying a Nazi banner at his stall in nearby Leek. Campaign Against Antisemitism's analysis of Home Office statistics shows that an average of over three hate crimes are directed at Jews every single day in England and Wales, with Jews almost four times more likely to be targets of hate crimes than any other faith group.Israel excels in fighting international bribery, watchdog finds[48]Transparency International, a watchdog group fighting corruption worldwide, named Israel in its top category for enforcement against corruption in international transactions, financial daily Globes reported Sunday. This is the second successive year in which Israel gets top marks for combating this type of corruption. Together with Israel, the US, the UK, and Switzerland were also given top marks among the 47 countries surveyed, the report said. Transparency International operates in over 100 countries and its Israeli office is headed by former President of the National Labor Court Judge Nili Arad. Recognizing the efforts Israel has invested in enforcing laws designed to eliminate corruption from international deals, the report said that between 2016 and 2019, Iocal law enforcement agencies have launched 10 investigations into such cases. One criminal indictment was filed and three cases concluded with imposing sanctions on the suspected parties. According to Globes, the report made note of directives issued by the State Attorney's Office in October 2019, outlining policy with regard to indicting corporations and the relevant penalties under the law. Investigations of foreign bribery cases are carried out by the Israel Police's National Fraud Unit and are supervised by the Lahav 433 Major Crimes Unit. Some involve the Israel Securities Authority and Tax Authority.Israel's pension system ranked third-best in world[49]Israel's pension system ranks third in the world, according to an annual global survey. The Mercer CFA Institute Global Pension Index rated Israel's pension system 74.7 out of 100, giving it a B grade and placing it third out of the 39 countries surveyed. This was Israel's first year being included on the 12-year-old index. The two countries that placed ahead of Israel, the Netherlands and Denmark, were the only two given an A grade, and are already widely regarded as having the best pension systems in the world. For comparison, the US and UK both were graded C+. More than half of the countries on the list saw their ratings drop this year as global economies contend with the economic fallout from the COVID-19 crisis. Broken down, Israel's pension system ranked fourth for sustainability, seventh for integrity, and 12th for adequacy. ""Israel's retirement income system comprises of a universal state pension and private pensions with compulsory employer and employee contributions,"" the report said. ""In most cases, annuities are paid from the private pension system.""Facebook unveils Instagram Lite, developed by Tel Aviv team[50]Facebook said Tuesday it has started to test a new, lightweight version of its popular Instagram App, with improved speed, performance, and responsiveness while using less data, to target users in emerging markets where network connectivity is unstable and speeds can be slow. Instagram Lite, the new version of the app for Android systems, is being developed by the social media giant's technology team in Tel Aviv, which was also responsible for leading the product development of the Facebook Lite feature — the lightweight version of the regular Facebook app for cellphones, used today by millions of users worldwide. Facebook's R&#38;D hub in Tel Aviv, set up in 2013, today employs a few hundred workers locally and is the second-largest strategic development center for the social media giant after the US, Tzach Hadar, director of Product Management for Lite interfaces and Tel Aviv tech site lead, said at a virtual meeting with reporters. Instagram Lite is less than 2MB, compared to 32MB for the regular app, which makes it fast to install and quick to load. It is designed to offer the core features of the original Instagram app for millions of users in emerging markets, such as Brazil, Indonesia, Philippines, Egypt and Turkey, who cannot access the original Instagram experience as they don't have access to high-speed Wi-Fi internet and are reliant on mobile connections that typically don't go above 2G or 3G, explained Michelle Lourie, product manager of Instagram Lite. Emerging markets will account for over 90% of new mobile subscribers globally, Facebook said in a statement.Fields of dreams: UAE farmers want Israeli sensors that let crops ask for water[51]As Israel finalizes an agreement to normalize relations with the United Arab Emirates, Netanya-based agriculture technology startup CropX Technologies is already fielding numerous calls and emails from the Gulf country, which only a few months ago was off limits to Israelis. 'CropX has started receiving many inquiries from interested agricultural companies and investors,' said Tomer Tzach, CEO of CropX, which makes simple to install underground sensors that track moisture and other soil properties. 'The UAE market is very relevant to CropX and has the potential of becoming CropX's third largest market.' The company's sensors store and analyze the data in the cloud and notify farmers via phone alerts when to water their fields, saving large amounts of water - a potential game-changer for the parched Gulf landscape. The experience of CropX highlights how the US-brokered agreement with the UAE is opening up opportunities for Israeli tech companies that focus on water and agriculture. The water-starved and fast-developing Gulf region is eager to find investTV show sold to HBO about Yom Kippur War premieres in Israel[52]Viewers were gripped Monday night by the first episode of 'Valley of Tears,' or 'She'at Neilah' in Hebrew, a fictionalized retelling of the 1973 Yom Kippur War that is the biggest-budget Israeli TV series to date. At 9:15 p.m. on Kan 11, and on the Kan 11 website, the main characters were introduced in an engrossing double episode lasting 83 minutes. Intended to tell the stories of the soldiers who battled in the war and deal with the national trauma the war inflicted on the Israeli psyche, 'Sha'at Neilah' brings the 1970s to life, from cars and fashions to slang and tanks. During the episode viewers meet Dafna (Joy Rieger), whose boyfriend, Yoav (Aviv Alush), is stationed at the Mount Hermon outpost that's later attacked by Syrian commandos; Alush (Imri Bitton), saying goodbye to his girlfriend before heading to the Golan, and Meni, a boozy journalist played by Lior Ashkenazi, who's in bed with two young women on Yom Kippur when his ex-wife calls, hysterical that their son is heading to battle. Up north in the Golan Heights, viewers meet the soldiers stationed at the Mount Hermon outpost, including Avinoam (Shahar Taboch), a genius and socially awkward intelligence soldier who speaks Arabic and is terrified about what's coming their way.

Good morning.
We’re covering China’s new strategy for economic growth, India’s surging cases and the science that brought back ancient dates in Israel.
China looks ahead to a more hostile world
China’s leader, Xi Jinping, has used recent trips to a corn farm, a steel plant and a tech innovation center to highlight a new economic strategy: The country will have to retool its economy to depend less on foreign economies in a post-pandemic world.
Mr. Xi has said that Chinese people need to spend more and manufacturers have to be more innovative. The most pressing issue at hand, according to official media comments on Mr. Xi’s strategy, is that China must be ready for sustained acrimony with the United States that could put at risk its access to the American market.
“This policy has a lot to do with China’s changing international environment, particularly the deterioration of Sino-American relations,” said Yao Yang, the dean of the National School of Development at Peking University. “China needs to prepare for the worst-case scenario, in which the U.S. seals off China in certain tech areas.”
Doubts: Chinese leaders have promised since at least 2006 to make domestic consumer spending a bigger share of economic activity — with mixed success. And China depends on imports of technology, crops and energy.
India now has the world’s second-highest case count
The country surpassed Brazil in the number of coronavirus cases on Monday and now ranks behind the United States, which has the world’s biggest outbreak.
India reported 90,802 new cases on Monday, breaking its own record from the day before and taking its total to more than 4.2 million, according to a New York Times database. Brazil is now third with more than 4.1 million cases. The U.S. caseload stands at more than 6.2 million.
India’s surge in cases comes as the government continues to ease lockdown measures in an effort to help the economy. On Monday, the subway system in New Delhi began a phased reopening after being shut for more than five months.
You can read more about how the pandemic has shattered India’s economy in our Back Story.
Here are the latest updates and maps of the pandemic.
In other developments:
Australia on Monday announced deals to buy almost 85 million doses of two promising coronavirus vaccines if their trials prove successful.
Pakistani officials said on Monday that they plan to open high schools and universities across the country as of Sept. 15, encouraged by the decline in cases over the past couple of months.
Long-haul patientshave begun to open up about how their mental health has suffered because of the virus. They are grappling with depression, anxiety and fatigue.
British health officials announced a sharp rise in new cases, mostly among young people. The 2,998 new cases were the highest number since late May, during the outbreak’s peak.
Belarus’s last protest leader vanishes
Local news media outlets reported that Maria Kolesnikova was grabbed off the street by masked kidnappers in the center of Minsk on Monday, bundled into a dark minivan and driven away at high speed. She was the last prominent protest leader in Belarus still at large.
With large-scale demonstrations showing little sign of winding down, President Aleksandr Lukashenko’s security forces appear to have shifted from mass repression to more targeted disappearances.
Linas Linkevicius, the foreign minister of neighboring Lithuania, said Ms. Kolesnikova had been the victim of a “kidnapping,”deploring in a Twitter post that “Stalinist N.K.V.D. methods are being applied in 21st century Europe” — referring to the predecessor to the K.G.B.

Reviving a lost fruit
The harvest this month of the long-lost Judean dates at a kibbutz in Israel was hailed as a modern miracle of science. The honey-blond fruit was plucked from a tree that sprouted from a 2,000-year-old seed retrieved from an archaeological site in the Judean wilderness.
Our reporter recounted the work and determination of two women — a researcher on natural medicine and an expert on arid agriculture — to bring back the ancient dates.
Here’s what else is happening
Jacob Blake: In a video recorded from his hospital bed, Mr. Blake, a Black man who was shot in the back by a white police officer in Kenosha, Wis., spoke publicly for the first time about what happened to him. “Every 24 hours, it’s pain — it’s nothing but pain,” he said.
Philippines: President Rodrigo Duterte pardoned a U.S. Marine who killed a transgender woman. The decision angered both nationalist groups that oppose the country’s military agreements with the U.S. and advocates for gay and transgender rights who said Mr. Duterte had shown leniency toward a hate crime.
Aleksei Navalny: The Russian opposition leader is no longer in a medically induced coma after a suspected poisoning, according to the German doctors treating him in Berlin. They added that it was too early to determine whether he will suffer long-term effects.
Jamal Khashoggi: A Saudi court has issued final verdicts in the killing of the dissident writer. Five of the eight defendants were sentenced to 20 years in prison each, two were given 17-year sentences and one was issued a 10-year sentence. The Saudis have never released the defendants’ names.
Snapshot: Above, coronavirus skeptics and far-right supporters during a protest in Berlin last weekend. President Trump is emerging as a kind of cult figure in Germany’s far-right scene and an inspiration to fringe groups like QAnon, whose following in Germany may now be the biggest, along with Britain, outside the U.S. Mr. Trump’s message of disruption is spilling far beyond American shores, extremism experts say.

How overlapping crises devastated India
Jeffrey Gettleman, our South Asia bureau chief, has been reporting on the economic downturn in India stemming from the country’s lockdown and virus outbreak. I talked to him about what went wrong and the path forward.
India’s economy was thought to be on track to rival China’s, but their paths have diverged widely this year in the pandemic. What happened?
In March, the prime minister imposed a very strict lockdown on the entire economy — no offices, no schools, no businesses, no transportation, no movement — and he gave people only four hours’ notice. People felt totally ambushed and didn’t have provisions in place. Millions of people lost their jobs.
There are also migrant workers — in India, over the last several decades there was an exodus from rural areas into urban areas for jobs. The government did not plan emergency provisions in a comprehensive way that reassured these people that they would be OK.
During the two-month lockdown, tens of millions of migrant workers walked back or took trucks, basically poured out of the urban areas of India. That did two things: That made the economic distress even worse. When the lockdown was lifted, there was a lot of labor missing. It also spread the coronavirus, because the virus was the most intense in crowded urban areas, and these people then were carriers and they brought the virus from the cities into every corner of the country. 
India’s economy has taken a bigger hit than any other economy in the world because its labor was more disrupted. The Chinese never did a national lockdown. They locked down parts of Wuhan Province and other places at different points. But they never imposed a paralyzing of the national economy. So when the lockdown was lifted, the economy did not just bounce back.
How permanent is this?
We don’t know. The Indian economy is definitely doing better. There’s traffic in the streets, shopping being done at the malls. Many offices are open or partially open. There’s much more economic activity than there was during the lockdown. But there are still many people who are separated from their jobs and don’t want to come back. There are others who have gone hundreds of miles away and are having trouble to come back.
That’s it for this briefing. See you next time.

168,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1251/Files (250).DOCX","The New York Times",2020-06-04,"1150 words","US","Richard Fausset",NA,"Judge Finds Probable Cause for Murder Charges in Arbery Case",FALSE,"A Georgia investigator testified that one of the three defendants accused of chasing down and killing Ahmaud Arbery heard another defendant use a racist slur.
ATLANTA — A Georgia investigator testified on Thursday that one of the three white defendants accused of chasing down and killing Ahmaud Ar bery, a black man who was running in a South Georgia neighborhood, heard another defendant use a racist slur moments after firing the shotgun blasts that ended Mr. Arbery’s life.
The explosive revelation, suggesting overt racism was at play in the case, came in a hearing in Brunswick, Ga., that ended with Judge Wallace E. Harrell of Glynn County Magistrate Court determining that sufficient probable cause existed to support the murder charges brought against the three men.
There were several fiery moments in the hearing. At one point, after a lawyer for one defendant referred to the Book of Amos, the special prosecutor Jesse Evans cited another Bible verse.
“I’ve got one,” he said. “What about ‘Love thy neighbor’?” The three defendants, Mr. Evans said, had hunted down a “defenseless” man. “He was tormented, he was hunted, he was targeted,” Mr. Evans said.
The hearing brought fresh attention to Mr. Arbery’s case, one of several recent incidents of violence against black people that have convulsed much of the United States in sustained protest over racial inequities in the justice system. As significant details of Mr. Arbery’s case were being revealed, a somber memorial service was being held in Minneapolis for George Floyd, a black man who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.
A federal civil rights probe into Mr. Floyd’s death was announced last Friday by Attorney General William P. Barr. Lawyers for Mr. Arbery’s family have said that a federal civil rights probe into the Arbery case is also underway.
In an interview on Thursday, L. Chris Stewart, the lawyer for Mr. Arbery’s mother, said the revelation of the racist language should be enough to trigger indictments under the federal hate crimes statute.
“This is the proof they need to actually bring charges,” he said.
Outside the courthouse in Brunswick, protesters gathered to call for justice for Mr. Arbery. Inside, some of the participants wore masks to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
The hearing largely focused on testimony from Richard Dial, an assistant special agent in charge for the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and the lead agent in the case. Mr. Dial said Travis McMichael, 34, who prosecutors say shot Mr. Arbery three times with a shotgun, was overheard using a racist epithet by William Bryan, a neighbor who has also been charged.
Mr. Dial said Mr. Bryan was also involved in the pursuit and tried to stop Mr. Arbery with his vehicle several times.
The chase began in the early afternoon of Feb. 23, when Mr. McMichael’s father, Gregory McMichael, 64, saw Mr. Arbery running in the Satilla Shores neighborhood just outside of Brunswick, and suspected that Mr. Arbery was the perpetrator of a series of break-ins. Both the father and son armed themselves, got into a pickup truck and began chasing Mr. Arbery.
The culmination of the chase was a physical fight between Mr. Arbery and Travis McMichael that was captured on video by Mr. Bryan, who pulled up to the scene in his truck. The video shows Mr. Arbery running toward the McMichaels before swerving around their pickup truck in an apparent effort to avoid Travis McMichael, who was standing outside with his shotgun.
Then the two men clashed in front of the truck. Mr. Arbery was shot three times by Travis McMichael as Gregory McMichael watched from the truck bed.
The elder McMichael, a retired investigator in the local district attorney’s office, and his son, were arrested on May 7. Each was charged with murder and aggravated assault. Mr. Bryan was arrested on May 21 on charges of felony murder and criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment.
The three men remain in Glynn County jail and have not entered a plea in the case. The McMichaels appeared in the courtroom via a video feed.
Mr. Dial said that Travis McMichael had used racial epithets numerous times in past social media posts and text messages. Mr. Dial said that in one instance, Mr. McMichael, who runs a tour boat company, said he appreciated working on the water because there were no black people there. In another instance, Mr. Dial said that Mr. McMichael, responding to a video posted to social media, said it would have been better if someone had “blown” a black person’s “head off.”
Mr. Dial also said that Mr. McMichael had a Confederate flag sticker on the toolbox of his truck. And he said that Mr. Bryan also used racial epithets in text messages unrelated to the shooting.
Moments before he was chased, Mr. Arbery visited a house in the neighborhood that was under construction, as he had numerous times before. It remains unclear why he did so, but Mr. Dial said there was no evidence he stole anything. Mr. Dial also revealed, under questioning, that Mr. Arbery had a mental illness that caused him to have “auditory hallucinations.” He said Mr. Arbery was not being treated for that illness on the day he was killed.
Much of Mr. Dial’s time on the stand involved discussions about the minute details of the pursuit. Mr. Dial said that Mr. Bryan had stated to officials that Mr. Arbery was forced into a ditch as he tried to avoid Mr. Bryan’s truck, and at one point appeared to try to open the passenger-side door after Mr. Bryan had used his truck to try to block Mr. Arbery’s escape.
Lawyers for all three men argued that the charges against their clients should be dropped. Mr. Bryan’s lawyer, Kevin Gough, said it was impossible to show that his client knew that the McMichaels were “acting wrongfully.” Jason Sheffield, a lawyer for Travis McMichael, argued that his client was acting in self-defense after Mr. Arbery attacked him.
Franklin Hogue, a lawyer for Gregory McMichael, said that while “we might agree” that his client leaving the house with a firearm “may not have been a very good idea,” he had a legitimate reason to want to “intercept” someone he thought may have committed a crime.
The case has been handled by four district attorneys, and state investigators are looking into whether it was mishandled by the first two of them, Jackie Johnson of Brunswick, and George E. Barnhill of Waycross, Ga. Mr. Barnhill, soon after the shooting, advised local police that probable cause did not exist to charge anyone in the case, and no one was arrested for weeks.
Andrea Young, executive director of the A.C.L.U. of Georgia, said in a statement on Thursday that the hearing showed that the two prosecutors were “unfit for their offices,” and called on them to resign.

Chris Bedford is a senior editor at The Fed­er­alist and vice chairman of the Young Amer­icans for Freedom Board of Gov­ernors and a board member at the National Jour­nalism Center. From 2015 to 2019, Bedford served as editor-in-chief of the Daily Caller News Foun­dation, and he is the author of ""The Art of the Donald: Lessons from Amer­ica's Philosopher-in-Chief.""
This is your first time on campus. What do you think about the look of Hillsdale and its location in small town Michigan? How do you think that helps?
I love it. Hillsdale is idyllic in a way that I wasn't sure still existed at U.S. colleges...My goal is to have a smoking room that looks like your Her­itage Room. When I walked in I was like, ""Oh my gosh, this is where I want to light a cigar.""
For your talk yes­terday, you recently fact checked and dis­proved the story in the Atlantic in which Derecka Purnell claimed she wit­nessed a child shot by a police officer in her youth. If that story is any indi­cation, how prevalent are unjus­tified police shootings?
You can almost play a sad and cynical game in news jour­nalism. When you hear a story about a crime, you can basi­cally set your clocks to when it's exposed as being false. Not all of them - but there's this weird thing that's been going on for the last 10 years. And it's these fan­tas­tical ideas of hate crimes. So if a crime that you hear about sounds like some­thing out of a 1960s movie about the Ku Klux Klan 100 years ago, then it probably didn't happen. If it's some­thing like a guy attacked outside of a bar by a bunch of white people for hitting on the wrong girl, that sounds believable...They almost always, by the way, never find a culprit.
Police shootings are mas­sively over-reported. Sta­tis­ti­cally, Black people are not tar­geted for fatal shootings more than white people are. There is a higher chance of you being pulled over if you're a Black person, but in inci­dents that escalate to physical force, white people are more likely to be killed. The idea that there's a sys­temic hunting of Black men and women by Amer­ica's police officers is not brought out by any facts. The idea, however, that some people push back, that there is not real abuse by people who are in any position of power, espe­cially those armed with monopoly enforcement? That's also false. There is police over­reach, there is police abuse. The idea that it's a plague on America, when in reality many places have been declining for years, is obscene and it's a left-wing lie.
Who actually wants to defund the police and why?
That's the funny thing about the defund-the-policers. One, it's the Marxists and the leftists and the anar­chists. They say ""defund the police."" But what they really mean is that they want to be the police. There will be force. There will be street justice. There will be people who are tar­geted for vio­lence. But they want to take it into their own hands. And you can see that in the way that they act, the way they treat their political oppo­nents. They're not inter­ested in being nice. They're not inter­ested in treating people gently. They're not inter­ested in loving their neighbor. They're inter­ested in phys­i­cally attacking their political oppo­nents and ide­o­logical oppo­nents, des­e­crating churches, burning down busi­nesses. They want a Reign of Terror.
I was upset at the White House rallies. I did not go down there, my friends did. During the last night of the Repub­lican National Con­vention, they brought a guil­lotine to this rally. I see more and more of these hardcore left-wing rallies.
How do you think that the last few months of rioting, looting, and burning cities have influ­enced voters?
In January and Feb­ruary, it was very dif­ficult to foresee a demo­c­ratic victory over Donald Trump. People don't lose re-election when the country feels like it's going in the correct direction and when the economy is booming. Mainly though, it's a great sta­tistic when people feel like their country is going in the right direction. If they don't, you lose the election, no matter how good the economy was. This is not a Donald Trump problem. Joe Biden had no dif­ference in his plan. Basi­cally everyone except for Taiwan and Sweden had this problem of mis­han­dling coro­n­avirus, mass deaths, and mass chaos...that's a very dif­ficult thing for a pres­ident to survive. The two groups that he struggled most with to win - and he had lost over with his rhetoric and his uncom­pro­mising cad style - were elderly voters and sub­urban white women. People who do not want to turn on their tele­vision and see their pres­ident cursing in a report. The only thing that is really going to bug them a whole lot more than somebody cursing on tele­vision is somebody burning down their city. And it's easy if that's in Portland, in Los Angeles - that's far away. I don't live near there. They're crazy. When you start doing that in Wis­consin, that's when you see the New York Times, CNN, all these people writing: ""Well, maybe this is not a good cam­paign tactic.""
And if you turn on your tele­vision, and you see a pros­perous city in Wis­consin, other cities that are not, you know, the usual places you're sus­pecting either left-wing schools or very poor urban neigh­bor­hoods, then people start to think it could happen.
What role has the media played in showing Amer­icans what's taking place in cities across the nation in recent months?
They haven't. They've so viciously lied about it. If you watch certain sta­tions, you would think that protests are peaceful. Repub­licans are a threat to the safety of people, right-wing ter­rorists are a bigger problem. And Donald Trump didn't get nom­i­nated for two Nobel Peace prizes.
But what the media has revealed is how absolutely scornful most of our media elites are. They no longer hide their absolute con­tempt. Which is good - it's good to be honest if you hate somebody like that."

James Murdoch has said he quit his father's media empire because it was 'legitimizing disinformation' and slammed 'crazy' Trump for 'infecting the US with cruelty' and downplaying COVID-19. 
The youngest son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch and his second wife Anna told the New York Times about his decision to break free from the family business, saying he 'pulled the rip cord' because he was 'increasingly uncomfortable' with News Corp and Fox 'legitimizing disinformation' and denying climate change.
In a major departure from his father's Fox business which has long been an ally of the president, Murdoch also blasted Trump's 'craziness' for denying the dangers of the pandemic and said 'it's no coincidence the number of hate crimes in this country are rising' since he entered the White House. 
Murdoch, 47, sensationally quit the board of News Corp at the end of July citing 'disagreements over certain editorial content published by the company's news outlets'. 
News Corp is one of the two major media conglomerates owned by the Murdoch family, the other being Fox Corporation, which was established after The Walt Disney Company acquired the majority of 21st Century Fox last year. 
The empire and the dramas going on among family members has been an inspiration for the popular TV show 'Succession'. 
Murdoch told the Times it was 'not that hard a decision' to stand down from News Corp because of major disagreements with his father and brother Lachlan over the running of the business.
He accused the news organization of 'hid[ing] agendas', 'sow[ing] doubt' and 'obscur[ing] fact' to its audience at a time when Trump has blasted other outlets for spreading so-called fake news while often heaping praise on conservative outlet Fox. 
'I reached the conclusion that you can venerate a contest of ideas, if you will, and we all do and that's important,' he told the Times. 
'But it shouldn't be in a way that hides agendas. A contest of ideas shouldn't be used to legitimize disinformation. 
'And I think it's often taken advantage of. And I think at great news organizations, the mission really should be to introduce fact to disperse doubt - not to sow doubt, to obscure fact, if you will.' 
Murdoch said he became 'increasingly uncomfortable' with the inner workings at the company and so 'pulled the rip cord.' 
'I just felt increasingly uncomfortable with my position on the board having some disagreements over how certain decisions are being made,' he said. 
'So it was actually not that hard a decision to remove myself and have a kind of cleaner slate.' 
Murdoch said he felt he couldn't change the company from the inside and so no longer wanted to be associated with it.
'I think there's only so much you can do if you're not an executive, you're on the board, you're quite removed from a lot of the day-to-day decisions, obviously,' he said. 
'And if you're uncomfortable with those decisions, you have to take stock of whether or not you want to be associated and can you change it or not. 
'I decided that I could be much more effective outside.' 
He added that he had 'been arguing about politics since I was a teenager' with his father. 
Murdoch told the Times his new ventures include investing in start-ups created to combat fake news and the spread of disinformation.
He said fake news was 'terrifying' because it 'undermine our ability to discern what's true and what's not' and said the spread of disinformation 'is only at the beginning as far as I can tell.' 
 THE MURDOCH FAMILY MEDIA EMPIRE 
RUPERT MURDOCH, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF NEWS CORP 
The Australian-born mogul began building his media empire in Australia by acquiring numerous publications in the 1950s, before entering the British newspaper market in 1969, and expanding to the US in 1974. 
He founded News Corporation in 1980, which quickly evolved into one of the largest media groups in the world owning assets in print, news, and television.
In 2013, News Corporation split into two sister companies, News Corp and 21st Century Fox. The latter was later rebranded as Fox Corporation after the majority of its assets were sold to The Walt Disney Company in 2019. 
Murdoch currently serves as the executive chairman of News Corp and the chairman of Fox Corporation. He is estimated to be worth $17billion. 
LACHLAN MURDOCH, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN AND CEO OF FOX CORPORATION, CO-CHAIR OF NEWS CORP
Lachlan Murdoch, 48, the eldest of the Murdoch children, is the heir apparent to News Corp Executive Chairman Rupert and is co-chairman of News Corp. He was named executive chairman and CEO of Fox Corp in 2019, after 21st Century Fox was sold to Disney. 
Before the sale, younger brother James had been the CEO of the company and Lachlan was executive chairman. Lachlan is also chairman of Australian entertainment company NOVA Entertainment, which operates a number of radio stations across the country.
JAMES MURDOCH, FORMER BOARD MEMBER OF NEWS CORP
The younger son of Rupert Murdoch, James, 47, had been on the board of News Corp since 2013. He and brother Lachlan had shared power at 21st Century Fox, but the sale of much of the Fox entertainment business to Disney in 2019 saw James depart as CEO. 
Since then, he has worked at the helm of investment fund Lupa Systems. 
James is considered more liberal than his older brother who is CEO of Fox Corp, home to conservative news network Fox News, the Fox broadcast and sports networks and local TV stations. 
James has been critical of News Corp's editorial decisions and has said he disagreed with Fox News coverage. He resigned from the board on July 31, 2020.
PRUDENCE MURDOCH, NON-EXECUTIVE BOARD MEMBER OF NEWS CORP
Prudence Murdoch, 62, is the eldest child of Rupert Murdoch through his first marriage with Patricia Booker. 
She formerly worked as journalist for now-defunct British tabloid, News of the World, which was owned by her father.
Prudence was once described in the media as the 'only one of [Murdoch's] children not directly competing for his business affections.'
ELISABETH MURDOCH, MEDIA EXECUTIVE AND FORMER CHAIRPERSON OF SHINE GROUP
Elisabeth is Rupert Murdoch's daughter from his second marriage with Anna Maria Torv. Born in Sydney, she moved to London in 1990s where she worked on the operations side of BSkyB, ran by her father. 
She founded UK-based TV programming company Shine Limited in 2001, which was sold to News Corp ten years later. 
She currently serves as executive chairman of production company Sister.
GRACE AND CHLOE MURDOCH
The sisters, aged 19 and 17, are Rupert's daughters from his third marriage to Wendi Deng.
He is also funding a research program to study how society is being manipulated by technology including through the use of mass surveillance and 5G. 
As well as spreading 'disinformation' Murdoch revealed other major disagreements including his father's unwillingness to replace Roger Ailes with former CBS News president David Rhodes in 2016, after Ailes faced multiple accusations of sexual harassment at Fox. 
The Harvard dropout also cited the vast differences in opinion around climate change. 
Murdoch, who announced he would make Sky carbon neutral in 2006, told the Times climate change is 'a crisis'. 
'Climate is also a public health crisis,' he said when asked about coronavirus. 
His wife Kathryn also told the Times she was shocked that some people and organizations - including her husband's family's business - are still denying its existence in 2020. 
'I never thought that we would actually be at the point where we would have climate change effects and people would still be denying it,' she said. 
The couple have long championed sustainability but the disparities with News Corp really came to a head in January when they said they were 'frustrated' when Fox peddled a theory that climate change was not to blame for the Australian wildfires that destroyed more than 46 million acres nationwide. 
Murdoch also sought to dispel rumors that he had wanted to take over the helm at Disney after pushing for News Corp to reach a deal with the entertainment giant. 
'I decided pretty soon after we closed it that I didn't want to stay on in the business,' he said.
He added: 'We never really even took talks very far at all about going to Disney because I informed them, because they were really trying to figure, ""OK, what does the structure look like? Et cetera."" I called Bob [Iger] and said, ""Look, you need to design that without me.""'
Murdoch went on to slam Trump calling his administration 'dangerous' and blaming him for a spike in hate crime across America. 
'I'm just concerned that the leadership that we have, to me, just seems characterized by callousness and a level of cruelty that I think is really dangerous and then it infects the population,' he said. 
'It's not a coincidence that the number of hate crimes in this country are rising over the last three years for the first time in a long time.' 
He blasted Trump's handling of coronavirus saying his likening of the virus to the flu 'from day 1' is 'craziness.' 
Trump has repeatedly downplayed the severity of the virus and refused to wear a mask for several months as cases soared nationwide and health experts urged Americans to wear face coverings to slow the spread.
The president tested positive for the virus last week and was hospitalized for four days and given experimental drugs for treatment after his condition deteriorated.
However, he has now left the hospital and returned to his stance downplaying the virus, telling people to 'not fear' the virus that has killed more than 200,000 Americans and claiming he is 'cured'. 
Murdoch also showed disapproval for Fox's very close relationship with the president.
When asked about Sean Hannity comparing Trump's actions during the pandemic to the leadership of President Roosevelt and his 'we have nothing to fear but fear itself' speech in 1933, he said 'it's a little much'. 
Murdoch threw his support behind Joe Biden saying 'hell yes' when asked if he will be voting for the Democratic candidate in November's election. 
He donated to Pete Buttigieg in the primary has given $1.23 million to Biden's campaign. 
James previously served as the CEO of 21st Century Fox but stepped down following the sale. 
Since then, he has worked at the helm of the investment fund Lupa Systems. 
Rupert Murdoch designed his companies to benefit his family, making certain that he and his children always had control. 
But the media tycoon has not left his children with a plan for the future of his media empire, refusing to officially name an heir despite making no secret of his preferred child - Lachlan. 
Lachlan, Murdoch's older son, is the 'golden child' according to multiple sources - not his oldest child Prudence or the next in line Elisabeth, who has found incredible success outside the family business in emerging media markets. 
James, who stood by his side for decades and weathered the fallout from the 2011 hacking scandal at News of the World and the 2016 sexual assault scandal at Fox News, is also not the firm favorite. 
The media mogul is the father of six children, who range in age from 61 to 16. 
News Corp also publishes major papers in Australia and the UK and owns the HarperCollins book publisher. "

Don Damond said he wanted to comfort the partner and daughter of Floyd, who died after fired Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pinned him to the ground by putting his knee on the unarmed black man's neck. 
Mr Damond called for an overhaul of the controversial police force, three years after 40-year-old Justine, from Sydney's northern beaches, was shot dead outside her home by disgaved Mineneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor, who was tried and found guilty of her murder. 
""I'm sad, angry, so disappointed and I just really want to put my arms, maybe figuratively, around Roxy and her daughter,"" Mr Damond told Seven News at Minneapolis Airport before boarding a plane to Houston.
""This really sliced open something that you hope will heal - Mohamed Noor was sentenced a year ago.

Justine Damond called 911 in 2017 after hearing a woman's screams behind her home. When she approached Noor's vehicle he shot her dead, claiming he thought he was being ambushed.
KKK LEADER DRIVES INTO PROTESTERS 
An American man who allegedly drove his car through a group of protesters is an ""admitted leader of the Ku Klux Klan and a propagandist for Confederate ideology,"" prosecutors say.
Witnesses say Harry Rogers, 36, ""revved his engine"" and sped up before driving onto the median strip and into a crowd of Black Lives Matters protesters in Virginia on the weekend, according to WTVR.
No one was seriously injured, and Rogers was arrested by police.
Prosecutors said in court on Monday (local time) that Rogers told arresting officers that he was the president of the Ku Klux Klan in Virginia.
""The accused, by his own admission and by a cursory glance at social media, is an admitted leader of the Ku Klux Klan and a propagandist for Confederate ideology,"" Henrico County Commonwealth's lawyer Shannon Taylor said in a statement released after court, according to WTVR.
""We are investigating whether hate crimes charges are appropriate.""
Taylor labelled Rogers' act ""heinous and despicable"".
""We will prosecute to the fullest extent of the law,"" she said. 
""We lived through this in Virginia in Charlottesville in 2017. I promise Henricoans that this egregious criminal act will not go unpunished. Hate has no place here under my watch.""
MASSIVE BAIL SET FOR COP IN GEORGE FLOYD MURDER CASE
The white ex-cop charged with murder in African-American George Floyd's death was ordered to be held on $A1.8 million bail in his first court appearance since being arrested.
Former cop Derek Chauvin appeared before Judge Jeannice Reding at the Hennepin County District Court early today AEST via video link from Oak Park Heights Prison.
His bail was set at $A1.8m with no conditions and $A1.5m with conditions that include no police or law enforcement work.
Under these conditions, Chauvin would also have to surrender his firearms or ammunition, his firearm permit and would not be allowed to leave Minnesota or have contact with George Floyd's family.
The defence did not object to the prosecutor's bail proposal.
Chauvin was handcuffed in an orange jail house jumpsuit with a white T-shirt and stated his name and address.
He also answered several questions from the judge including that he still has guns at his property.
The ex-officer only appeared in court for 11 minutes and will next appear on June 29.
Chauvin, 44, is charged with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the May 25 death of Floyd, who died after being pinned down by the cop's knee for nearly nine minutes while pleading repeatedly, ""I can't breathe"".
Floyd's death, caught on viral video, has sparked worldwide outrage and massive demonstrations calling for justice racial equality across the US and in dozens of countries on five continents.
Chauvin was initially charged with third-degree murder, but the charges were upgraded after an outcry from Floyd's family and other supporters.
The three other officers involved in the incident - Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng, and Tou Thao - are charged with aiding and abetting. 
Chauvin faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted.
All four cops were fired by Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey the day after the incident, and Chauvin was arrested the day after that.
Chauvin, a 19-year veteran of the Minneapolis department, has been the subject of more than a dozen complaints over his career.
His arraignment came as a memorial and funeral services for Floyd were held in his hometown of Houston.
'I'M NOT WITH THEM', BIDEN SAYS OF 'POLICE-FREE USA' ADVOCATES
Presidential candidate Joe Biden has been forced to quickly distance himself from fellow Democrats in the US calling for police departments to be ""de-funded"" and ""dismantled"".
Some far-left Democrats have advocated a ""police-free America"" to appease Black Lives Matter protesters - potentially creating a nightmare ""law and order"" showdown for Mr Biden with President Donald Trump in the lead up to the November presidential election.
The President of the Minneapolis City Council, Lisa Bender, even said people who expect to be able to call police when their home is broken into come from ""a place of privilege"".
A majority of members of her council have said they will move to ""dismantle"" the city's police department - a move opposed by its Mayor Jacob Frey.
Interviewed on CNN, Cr Lisa Bender was asked who someone would call for help in a ""police-free"" society if their home was broken into in the middle of the night.
""I hear that loud and clear from a lot of my neighbours,"" Cr Bender replied.
""And I know that comes from a place of privilege, because for those of us for whom the system is working, I think we need to step back and imagine what it would feel like to already live in that reality, where calling the police may mean more harm is done. 
""And so in the very immediate we have to lean into whatever changes we can make into our existing police department.
""We have done an analysis of all the reasons people call 911 and looked at ways we can shift the response away from armed police officers into a more appropriate response for metal health calls, some domestic violence calls, some health-related issues.""
She dodged a question about whether the left-wing attack on police was playing into the hands of President Donald Trump.
Mr Trump tweeted: ""Now the Radical Left Democrats want to Defund and Abandon our Police. Sorry, I want LAW & ORDER!""
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden ""does not believe that police should be defunded,"" a spokesman for his campaign said.
Mr Biden ""hears and shares the deep grief and frustration of those calling out for change"" and ""supports the urgent need for reform"".
But the spokesman said Mr Biden believes providing funding is necessary to help improve policing, including by supporting ""community policing programs that improve relationships between officers and residents"".
Commentators in the US say Mr Biden will be placed in a difficult position by left-leaning Democrat voters who will demand he support the ""de-fund the cops"" movement.
Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh called Mr Biden ""complicit"" in the de-fund police movement, which has garnered strength in the wake of Floyd's death. 
It calls for funds to be removed from police departments and allocated to social services instead and some call for police departments to be dissolved altogether.
""As the protesters like to say, silence is agreement. By his silence, Joe Biden is endorsing defunding the police,"" Mr Murtaugh said. 
Former Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis said taking funds away from police departments - 90 per cent of which pays wages - would reduce police numbers in areas of most need.
""This talk about disbanding police is just a bridge too far,"" Mr Davis said.
Mr Trump had lashed out at his rival on Twitter this weekend as he said Biden and democrats ""controlled by the Radical Left"" would aim to defend the police during the civil unrest that has gripped the country.
""Sleepy Joe Biden and the Radical Left Democrats want to 'DEFUND THE POLICE.' I want great and well paid LAW ENFORCEMENT. I want LAW & ORDER!"" he raged on Saturday night.
On Sunday, NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that he would be cutting the NYPD's budget while officials in Minneapolis confirmed that they intended to disband the police force there.
THOUSANDS TURN OUT FOR LATEST FLOYD MEMORIAL
Mourners turned out in their thousands to view George Floyd's Golden Casket in Houston on Monday US time, a day before he's buried in the state of Texas.
The 46-year-old man died two weeks ago after he was taken into police custody in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and former Officer Derek Chauvin knelt on the back of his neck for nearly nine minutes.
Floyd's casket will be open to the public at The Fountain of Praise church from 12 to 6pm local time, and guests will have to wear masks and gloves because of the coronavirus outbreak.
A funeral for Floyd is scheduled to be held at 11am local time on Tuesday (early Wednesday AEST), and he will be laid to rest next to his mother at Houston Memorial Gardens in Pearland.
Church Pastor Wright said of the Floyd family: ""They really have not had a chance to really grieve because this case is so worldwide.""
""So we are not only concerned about them today but also what will they need next month and the month after that.""
Co-pastor Mia Wright added, according to KARE news outlet: ""Our hearts' desire is to serve her and her family, that's where our opportunity to serve the Floyd family began.""
SUNDAY PROTESTS TURN VIOLENT IN SEATTLE
As cities around the US withdrew police and ended their curfews as the protests have become more peaceful, the Seattle police department were still out in force last night, using tear gas to disperse protesters. 
Two days ago, Seattle police promised to not use tear gas for the next 30 days, but on Sunday night protesters could be seen fleeing from clouds of tear gas that chased them down the street, amid several explosions from flash bangs.
MAN SHOOTS PROTESTER IN SEATTLE 
Video footage has emerged of the moment a man drove a car at George Floyd protesters in Seattle, hit a barricade then exited the vehicle brandishing a pistol.
At least one person was injured in the shocking incident. 
The Seattle Fire Department said the victim was a 27-year-old male who was shot and taken to a hospital in stable condition. 
Video taken by a reporter for The Seattle Times showed part of the scene in the city's Capitol Hill neighbourhood, where demonstrators have gathered for days near a police precinct.
Police later said the suspect was taken into custody and a firearm was recovered.
ANGER OVER MAYOR'S STANCE 
Minneapolis City Council has also announced its intention to completely disband the Minneapolis Police Department.
Nine of 12 councillors said they supported the move to replace it with ""a new public safety model"" - although there was little detail to go with the dramatic announcement.
New York City and Los Angeles also announced their intentions to cut funding to their police departments, which will pit them against powerful and angry police unions.
""This council is going to dismantle this police department,"" Minneapolis Councillor Jeremiah Ellison told a joyous group of protesters. 
Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey was humiliated when he refused to commit to disband the police force when asked at a protest rally. He was heckled and booed as he shuffled away from the rowdy mob.
US policing expert Charles Ramsey said he was disturbed by the developments.
""Will the public be safe? Criminals don't go on holiday,"" he said.
""The Minneapolis Police Department needs reform. But throwing it out altogether without having some other plan in place seems hard to understand.""
New York ended its curfew and President Donald Trump withdrew troops from Washington DC as large protests continued, but mostly peacefully.
BRITISH PROTESTS DESCEND INTO CHAOS 
Not so in the UK, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson slammed protesters who attacked police officers.
Mr Johnson denounced the ""thuggery"" of protesters who turned Britain's streets into chaos for a second day, with bloodied police officers targeted with bottles. 
Winston Churchill's statue was defaced and a lone protester tried to set the Union Jack on fire at The Cenotaph, a major war memorial in London.
In Bristol there were scenes reminiscent of Saddam Hussein's statue being torn down in Iraq, when the figure of Edward Colston, a 17th century slave trader was thrown into the harbour. 
Protesters also closed major roads across the UK as the Black Lives Matter movement, sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis continued. 
MORE NEWS 
""People have a right to protest peacefully and while observing social distancing but they have no right to attack the police,"" Mr Johnson said.
""These demonstrations have been subverted by thuggery - and they are a betrayal of the cause they purport to serve. 
""Those responsible will be held to account.""
Police were chased down the streets near Parliament Square and Downing Street, with some officers injured and bloodied in the attacks.
A police officer fell off her horse on the weekend in earlier violent protests.
Churchill's statue in London was defaced for a second day, with protesters spraying the words ""was a racist"" under the name of the
man regarded as a war hero in Britain.
There were fears that the protests may spark another wave of COVID-19 across the world.
The White House infectious diseases expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, said he was dismayed by images of protesters linked arm in arm - many not wearing masks.
""I get very concerned, as do my colleagues in public health, when they see these kinds of crowds,"" he said.
""There certainly is a risk. As I sat in front of the TV and watched the screen go from Washington, DC, to New York City, to Los Angeles, to Philadelphia, I got really concerned.
""I was going, 'Oh my goodness. I hope this doesn't set us back a lot.' After all of the work in trying to maintain the physical distance and doing all the things, I became very concerned that we might see a resurgence.""

172,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1251/Files (250).DOCX","MINT",2020-11-05,"782 words",NA,NA,NA,"H-1B visa a political challenge for victor",FALSE,"New delhi, Nov. 5 -- The H-1B visa rules following the outcome of the US presidential elections will determine the future course of action for skilled professionals seeking to work in the US. The Donald Trump administration's efforts to tighten the visa guidelines had intensified in recent months, especially after the pandemic-induced job losses affected over 40 million Americans.
But, while Trump's anti-immigrant stand is well-documented with his desire to keep ""American jobs for American workers"", will H-1B visa norms be relaxed with a change in the regime?
US-based law firms said it was usually easier to introduce restrictions on immigrants than relax controls, and even a new president will be hard-pressed to be more generous to the H-1B programme, especially amid the pandemic that has left the American economy battered.
The H-1B programme has been under pressure for a long time and even faced challenges during the Obama administration when Joe Biden was vice-president.
""The immediate impact of a Biden victory on immigration may be felt more in administration than in policy,"" said Mark Davies, global chairman at Davies and Associates Llc, an immigration law firm based in New York. Davies said that Trump's government had been operating the US visa processing system at suboptimal efficiency, slowing the application process down, thereby reducing the number of visas issued. Biden could be expected to reverse this. ""The president is limited in what he can do alone on immigration policy and would need to work with Congress to reform the system. Presidents can introduce executive orders bypassing the Congress, but these are usually short-term measures and are an unviable way to govern in the long term,"" he added.
On its part, the Indian government has sought predictability in the US visa regime after a number of changes were recently incorporated in the rules governing the issuance of the H-1B visas, which are popular with Indian IT software professionals.
""The people-to-people relationship is a special foundation"" of the US-India relationship, Indian foreign ministry spokesman Anurag Srivastava told reporters at a regular foreign office briefing last week.
""In our engagements, we have emphasized that this mutually beneficial partnership must be nurtured. We are engaged with the US government for increasing predictability in the visa regime."" Srivastava added that New Delhi had also stressed on the need to minimize the inconvenience faced by those in the US and those who needed to travel to the US for bonafide reasons. Earlier this year, Trump had issued an executive order suspending H-1B and a range of other visas in response to the pandemic. The order is set to expire at the end of the year, and it is unlikely that Biden would renew it if he is elected.
Nevertheless, Biden's immigration policy must take into account the looming unemployment crisis. Analysts agreed that H-1B visa, with its perceived adverse impact on American jobs, will remain politically challenging whoever wins the election. ""Overall, I see a more relaxed visa regime under Biden-Harris, and definitely one that won't tighten further. Biden is pro-immigration, and recognizes that immigrants bring economic, cultural and social value, which may also translate into more tech workers there, and even more of their family members,"" said Prasanto K. Roy, a public policy consultant.
Every year, the US administration issues 85,000 H-1B work permits, of which 65,000 are for people with specialty occupations, while the remaining are reserved for foreign workers who earned a masters or higher university degree in the US. Every year, Indians and Indian companies corner a large number of H-1B work permits. According to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, the department has received about 250,000 H-1B work visa applications, with Indians accounting for 184,000, or 67%, of the total work visas. Both Trump and Biden had been trying to woo the four-million-strong Indian American community ahead of the polls. In his campaign speeches, Biden has referred to the issue. ""We also believe America is a land of opportunity. But it's likely you and your family have been caught in the middle of President Trump's crackdown of legal immigration and pathways to permanent residency and citizenship and his decisions on the H-1B visa programme. And his dangerous rhetoric about immigrants has empowered white supremacists and even fuelled hate crimes against Indian Americans,"" he said.

At the heart of a historic moment, NASCAR's Bubba Wallace will keep talking about what's right.
If this were last year, Bubba Wallace and I would probably be talking about his drum set, his Richard Petty tattoo, and why he made fun of his girlfriend for sleep-farting on a Facebook reality show. After laughing a bit-Wallace has a cartoon laugh, a distinct ""ha-ha-ha""-he'd get serious and talk about the Daytona 500 and what it was like to finish second there in 2018, his rookie year, followed by a disappointing DNF in 2019. That would lead to a conversation about the pressure of driving the No. 43 Richard Petty Motorsports Camaro in NASCAR's top-level Cup series, especially as the only African Ameri­can driver. Then we'd talk about race, and I'd ask him how he kept his cool when baited online by a racist troll in 2017 and what it means to him to be the first full-time Black driver in the series since Wendell Scott raced in 1973. Mostly, though, we'd talk about racing.
But 2019 was a long time ago, and there's been relatively little racing this NASCAR season. There has, however, been a lot of conversation about race, and Wallace has been in the center of it. He's been thrust into the limelight as a leader and spokesperson, and he has embraced the role with a willingness and passion that surprised even his mother. She was quoted in the New York Times saying she didn't expect to see her son ""who doesn't really care about anything but getting in the car and driving"" wearing a Black Lives Matter shirt on the NASCAR grid and speaking out against the Confederate flag, which was subsequently banned from NASCAR events. In 2020, a conversation with Wallace was already going to be about race. Then came the report of the noose. A crew member on the No. 43 team saw a looped rope hanging in the garage at Talladega Superspeedway and brought it to the attention of NASCAR officials. With the timing so soon after the flag ban, it was considered a possible hate crime. The FBI arrived, and everyone in NASCAR spent a tense three days until the investigation found that while it did look like a noose and was only in that one garage, it had been there since at least 2019 and thus was not a threat directed at Wallace. Now it's all anyone wants to talk to him about.
""I have to ask you about it,"" I said to Wallace during our phone interview, ""or people will think I'm not doing my job.""
""Of course,"" he said and then repeated what he's said so many times in so many interviews this year_ He was relieved to learn it wasn't a hate crime directed at him; he was grateful there was no immediate danger to him or his family; he believes NASCAR responded appropriately to the possibility of a racially motivated threat; and when he finally saw the photos, the looped garage-door pull sure looked like a noose to him. ""What do you see when you look at the pictures?"" he said.
""It looks like a noose,"" I said.
""Simple as that,"" said Wallace.
He sounded tired, and I could hear him yawn, for which he apologized. ""How many interviews have you done this week?"" I asked. He gave a dry little laugh.
""Shit, I don't even know,"" he said. ""I think the PR team has had something like 300 requests."" I made a joke about how he should just record his answers and press play over the phone, but he didn't laugh again. ""I wish it was that easy,"" he said. ""I'm wore out, for sure. But you know, it's part of the deal, though.""
Before this year, before Wallace saw the murders of Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd captured on video, he figured it was enough to just be who he was, where he was, and talk about racing like everyone else. ""I didn't really pay attention to it when I was younger,"" he said. ""I was too young to understand it. We just raced a race, and I'd still like to do that, but unfortunately, now we have so much media, and they want to ask the hard-hitting questions. I just got to be ready for them.""
He paused and I apologized on behalf of the media, hard-hitting and less so, and he laughed. ""You're good,"" he said. ""Look, I don't mind talking about fighting for what's right and what I believe in. I told some fellow competitors that they have a voice, and they can stand up and speak out. That will be powerful. We really need to be talking about how to reach people, educate them.""
Wallace doesn't hide his emotions. He cried when he finished the Daytona 500 in the top three, and in a June appearance on CNN, he was visibly angry as he referenced the fallout from the FBI investigation, which had some commenters calling the whole thing a hoax. ""When you have a voice and you have a platform, people are going to try to take that away from you with all their power,"" he told CNN's Don Lemon, his voice shaking with frustration.
On our phone call in early July, though, he was quieter. Thoughtful. Maybe just exhausted. Still, I got a little hint of his energy when he talked about what he's been telling his friends and fellow drivers. ""You have to understand why Black people are so mad right now and educate yourself on that, understand why they're hurt,"" he said. ""Watch the devastating videos of the killings of Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd and the news about Breonna Taylor in recent weeks and what's still going on. What does the Confederate flag really mean? How does it impact African American culture and how does it represent pride and heritage to some and hate to others? I'm constantly trying to figure out why, trying to figure out the facts. I speak about what I believe is true and what I believe is right.""
His support group has been his family at home, but he said there are plenty of folks at the track who have his back. ""[Seven-time NASCAR champion] Jimmie Johnson, he's always checking in, always talking about it, offering advice and actually wanting to educate himself. He told me_ 'Man, I just want to be a better father. I want to help my girls understand as they grow up in these crazy times that we're in right now.' ""
When I ask about NASCAR's less-than-stellar history with racism, he said he doesn't think about it at all. ""We're in a time of right now. We're not in a time of back then, and that's what I focus on. If people still carry the same views that they did back then, so be it. I'll let them be pissed off because I ain't going nowhere."" Then he sighed, ""Hey, I have another interview right now.""
Another interview and another race. The Big Machine Hand Sanitizer 400 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway was two days away. I threw one last question at him before he hung up_ ""Bubba, what do you hope we'll be talking about at this time next year?""
""I'm a day-by-day guy,"" he said, ""but I hope we're talking about the race we just won, the good finish that we just had, and still fighting the good fight that's going on outside the racetrack."""

Written by Aidan Johnston
Joe Biden's So-Called ""Gun Safety"" Plan Explained
For the last four years we have had a Republican President in the White House. As in decades past, Republicans muddled with the NICS system and failed to defend bump stocks. But had Hillary Clinton won, gun owners would have suffered many more losses than this.
However, Gun Owners of America was able to achieve many policy goals under the Trump Administration.
We detailed that in an article titled: Ten Wins for Gun Owners Under the Trump Administration. But our victories will not survive a Biden-Harris Administration.
Imagine the destruction that will be caused by an Administration that refuses to acknowledge that the Second Amendment protects an individual right. Or a President who believes that's it's okay to confiscate millions of commonly-owned firearms.
That's what we are facing if Joe Biden wins the 2020 Presidential Election.
The following contains quotations directly from the Joe Biden gun control proposal. I will contextualize each proposed infringement.
Semi-automatic Gun and Magazine Bans and Confiscation
Federal Gun Bans and Magazine Bans to be enforced by Robert Francis Take your AR-15 O'Rourke:
Ban the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Federal law prevents hunters from hunting migratory game birds with more than three shells in their shotgun. That means our federal law does more to protect ducks than children. It's wrong. Joe Biden will enact legislation to once again ban assault weapons. This time, the bans will be designed based on lessons learned from the 1994 bans. For example, the ban on assault weapons will be designed to prevent manufacturers from circumventing the law by making minor changes that don't limit the weapon's lethality. While working to pass this legislation, Biden will also use his executive authority to ban the importation of assault weapons.
Mandatory gun and magazine registration, if you can afford it as each firearm or magazine will require a separate $200 NFA tax stamp:
Regulate possession of existing assault weapons under the National Firearms Act. Currently, the National Firearms Act requires individuals possessing machine-guns, silencers, and short-barreled rifles to undergo a background check and register those weapons with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). Due to these requirements, such weapons are rarely used in crimes. As president, Biden will pursue legislation to regulate possession of existing assault weapons under the National Firearms Act.
Mandatory gun confiscation:
Buy back the assault weapons and high-capacity magazines already in our communities. Biden will also institute a program to buy back weapons of war currently on our streets. This will give individuals who now possess assault weapons or high-capacity magazines two options: sell the weapons to the government, or register them under the National Firearms Act.
Prepare to ban the manufacture of all guns except so-called smart guns:
Put America on the path to ensuring that 100% of firearms sold in America are smart guns. Today, we have the technology to allow only authorized users to fire a gun. For example, existing smart gun technology requires a fingerprint match before use. Biden believes we should work to eventually require that 100% of firearms sold in the U.S. are smart guns. But, right now the NRA and gun manufacturers are bullying firearms dealers who try to sell these guns. Biden will stand up against these bullying tactics and issue a call to action for gun manufacturers, dealers, and other public and private entities to take steps to accelerate our transition to smart guns.
Strip the firearm and ammunition industry of civil liability protections and hold manufacturers, engaged in lawful commerce, liable for criminals engaging in criminal activity:
Hold gun manufacturers accountable. In 2005, then-Senator Biden voted against the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, but gun manufacturers successfully lobbied Congress to secure its passage. This law protects these manufacturers from being held civilly liable for their products a protection granted to no other industry. Biden will prioritize repealing this protection.
Ban the purchase of more than one firearm per month at the federal level:
Reduce stockpiling of weapons. In order to reduce the stockpiling of firearms, Biden supports legislation restricting the number of firearms an individual may purchase per month to one.
Universal Background [Registration] Checks
Bribe states to create licenses to purchase firearms using federal tax dollars:
Give states incentives to set up gun licensing programs. Biden will enact legislation to give states and local governments grants to require individuals to obtain a license prior to purchasing a gun.
References about UBCs that are reminiscent of the leaked Obama-Biden Administration's NIJ memo that said ""Effectiveness depends on the ability to reduce straw purchasing, requiring gun registration"" (emphasis added):
Keep guns out of dangerous hands. The federal background check system (the National Instant Criminal Background Check System) is one of the best tools we have to prevent gun violence, but it's only effective when it's used. Biden will enact universal background check legislation and close other loopholes that allow people who should be prohibited from purchasing firearms from making those purchases. Specifically, he will:
End the private sale of firearms, except for gifts to immediate family... for now:
Require background checks for all gun sales. Today, an estimated 1 in 5 firearms are sold or transferred without a background check. Biden will enact universal background check legislation, requiring a background check for all gun sales with very limited exceptions, such as gifts between close family members. This will close the so-called ""gun show and online sales loophole"" that the Obama-Biden Administration narrowed, but which cannot be fully closed by executive action alone.
Banning the sale of guns, ammo, and gun parts online:
End the online sale of firearms and ammunitions [sic]. Biden will enact legislation to prohibit all online sales of firearms, ammunition, kits, and gun parts.
Enact a Homemade Gun Ban.
Stop ""ghost guns."" One way people who cannot legally obtain a gun may gain access to a weapon is by assembling a one [sic] on their own, either by buying a kit of disassembled gun parts or 3D printing a working firearm. Biden will stop the proliferation of these so-called ""ghost guns"" by passing legislation requiring that purchasers of gun kits or 3D printing code pass a federal background check.
Even more funding for the Universal Background Check System:
Adequately fund the background check system. President Obama and Vice President Biden expanded incentives for states to submit records of prohibited persons into the background checks system. As president, Biden will continue to prioritize that funding and ensure that the FBI is adequately funded to accurately and efficiently handle the NICS system.
Regulate what gun owners can and cannot do with their property in the privacy of their own homes:
Require gun owners to safely store their weapons. Biden will pass legislation requiring firearm owners to store weapons safely in their homes.
Prosecute gun owners for the new ""crime"" of teaching a minor how to safely handle a firearm or how to shoot or hunt with a firearm:
Hold adults accountable for giving minors access to firearms. Biden supports legislation holding adults criminally and civilly liable for directly or negligently giving a minor access to a firearm, regardless of whether the minor actually gains possession of the firearm.
More funding to prosecute NICS denials:
Prioritize prosecution of straw purchasers. ""Straw purchasers"" buy a firearm on behalf of an individual who cannot pass a background check. Biden will end those loopholes by enacting a law to make all straw purchases a serious federal crime and ensure the U.S. Justice Department has sufficient resources to prioritize their prosecution.
Funding to send police after NICS denials, again, 95% of which are law abiding citizens who received ""false positive"" denials from the FBI:
Notify law enforcement when a potential firearms purchaser fails a background check. Too often, when prohibited persons attempting to buy a firearm fail a background check, state and local law enforcement is never informed of the attempt. As president, Biden will direct the FBI to set up a process to ensure timely notification of denials to state and local law enforcement, and he'll support legislation to codify this process. This empowers law enforcement to follow up and ensure prohibited persons do not attempt to acquire firearms through other means.
Prosecute gun owners when a criminal steals their firearm or when they ""lose"" a firearm for failure to file a police report:
Require firearms owners to report if their weapon is lost or stolen. Responsible gun owners have a responsibility to inform law enforcement if their weapon is lost or stolen. Biden will enact legislation to make this the law of the land.
New ""Boyfriend Loophole"" Gun Ban, which includes special federal Gun Confiscation Orders for those convicted of ""stalking"" because they threatened a pet:
Close other loopholes in the federal background check system. In addition to closing the ""boyfriend loophole"" highlighted below [...]
New ""Hate Crime Loophole"" Gun Ban, which includes a gun ban for referring to someone as an ""illegal alien"" in New York City:
Close the ""hate crime loophole."" Biden will enact legislation prohibiting an individual ""who has been convicted of a misdemeanor hate crime, or received an enhanced sentence for a misdemeanor because of hate or bias in its commission,"" from purchasing or possessing a firearm.
Eliminate a three-business day deadline for the FBI to complete a NICS check, creating a potential 10 day waiting period for firearm purchases:
Close the ""Charleston loophole."" The Charleston loophole allows people to complete a firearms purchase if their background check is not completed within three business days. Biden supports the proposal in the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019, which extends the timeline from three to 10 business days. Biden will also direct the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to put on his desk within his first 100 days as president a report detailing the cases in which background checks are not completed within 10 business days and steps the federal government can take to reduce or eliminate this occurrence.
Further Gun Confiscation Legislation at the Federal, State, and Local Levels
Increase prosecution of NICS denials, 95% of which are law-abiding citizens who received ""false positive"" denials from the FBI:
Create an effective program to ensure individuals who become prohibited from possessing firearms relinquish their weapons. Federal law defines categories of individuals who are prohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms, and the federal background check system is an effective tool for ensuring prohibited persons cannot purchase firearms. But we lack any serious tool to ensure that when someone becomes newly prohibited for example, because they commit a violent crime they relinquish possession of their firearms. There are some promising models for how this could be enforced. For example, California has a mandatory process for ensuring relinquishment by any individual newly subject to a domestic violence restraining order. As president, Biden will direct the FBI and ATF to outline a model relinquishment process, enact any necessary legislation to ensure relinquishment when individuals newly fall under one of the federal prohibitions, and then provide technical and financial assistance to state and local governments to establish effective relinquishment processes on their own.
Bribe states to enact ex parte Gun Confiscation Orders with no due process using federal tax dollars:
Incentivize state ""extreme risk"" laws. Extreme risk laws, also called ""red flag"" laws, enable family members or law enforcement officials to temporarily remove an individual's access to firearms when that individual is in crisis and poses a danger to themselves or others. Biden will incentivize the adoption of these laws by giving states funds to implement them. And, he'll direct the U.S. Department of Justice to issue best practices and offer technical assistance to states interested in enacting an extreme risk law.
Executive Action
Reinstate the Social Security Gun Ban:
Reinstate the Obama-Biden policy to keep guns out of the hands of certain people unable to manage their affairs for mental reasons, which President Trump reversed. In 2016, the Obama-Biden Administration finalized a rule to make sure the Social Security Administration (SSA) sends to the background check system records that it holds of individuals who are prohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms because they have been adjudicated by the SSA as unable to manage their affairs for mental reasons. But one of the first actions Donald Trump took as president was to reverse this rule. President Biden will enact legislation to codify this policy.
Perpetuate an ineffective and unconstitutional ban on sharing 3D printed gun files online:
Biden will ensure that the authority for firearms exports stays with the State Department, and if needed, reverse a proposed rule by President Trump. This will ensure the State Department continues to block the code used to 3D print firearms from being made available on the Internet.
""Enforcing the laws we already have"" against law-abiding gun owners, such as executive action to continue banning pistol-braced firearms and re-designating them as Short Barreled Rifles or Any Other Weapons:
Reform, fund, and empower the U.S. Justice Department to enforce our gun laws. Biden will direct his Attorney General to deliver to him within his first 100 days a set of recommendations for restructuring the ATF and related Justice Department agencies to most effectively enforce our gun laws. Biden will then work to secure sufficient funds for the Justice Department to effectively enforce our existing gun laws, increase the frequency of inspections of firearms dealers, and repeal riders that get in the way of that work.
Each President sets the tone for their Presidency by achieving as many policy goals as they can in their first 100 days in office. For gun owners, this is bad news. Using the laws that we already have, a Biden-Harris Administration can wreak havoc on gun owners without any new acts of Congress. Still, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris promise much worse for gun owners.
From gun and magazine bans, licenses to purchase firearms, universal registration checks, and gun confiscation without due process, a Biden-Harris Administration promises four years of unrelenting efforts to infringe on the rights of gun owners.
Keep in mind, this list is far from exhaustive of what Joe Biden has promised he will do.
Of course, Gun Owners of America will defend your right to keep and bear arms through our lobbying efforts in Washington D.C. and our legal efforts in the courts regardless of who wins the 2020 Presidential and Congressional elections.
However, it is every American's duty to support the Constitution and our Second Amendment-recognized rights at the polls in every election.
So, get out there and defend your Second Amendment-protected rights!
Even if you have voted, please share this voter guide with your pro-gun friends and family before they get to the voting booth."

The antiracism activist fled on New Year's Eve in 2018 with his wife and toddler, seeking refuge in Norway, which has long welcomed political refugees from desperate corners of the world. 
But the activist, Rafal Gawel, wasn't escaping a war-torn country. He was fleeing Poland, a member of the democratic and peaceful European Union. Although his initial request for asylum in Norway was rejected, last month an appeals board there granted his request. 
It was a dramatic chain of events that underscored concerns elsewhere in Europe that Poland's democracy - once regarded as a great success story of the post-Soviet era - has regressed under the right-wing coalition that has ruled the country for the past five years. 
While Mr. Gawel's case is complicated, the asylum decision reflected worries about political influence in the Polish judicial system. Norway's immigration service said it had granted him asylum on the grounds that he faced political persecution in Poland, a rare instance of a country in Europe offering such protection to a citizen of the European Union. Norway is not a member of the bloc, but maintains close relations with it. 
A controversial and well-known artist and human rights activist in Poland, Mr. Gawel, 47, is a complicated figure at the center of an international tussle over democratic rights. He has had legal troubles in Poland, fleeing the country just before being sentenced to prison for two years for fraud and misappropriation of funds. 
He says, without providing evidence, that the charges against him were an effort by Poland's government to rein him in and that the trial was rigged. 
The Polish government has noted that the fraud charges were brought against him under a previous, more centrist administration in 2013. And a nonprofit group in Poland funded by the financier George Soros has accused Mr. Gawel of mismanaging funds that it allocated to his organization, the Center for Monitoring Racist and Xenophobic Behavior. Those charges were used in the court case against him. 
Mr. Gawel said that Poland's government had targeted him over his work documenting a growing number of hate crimes in the country, and that it had ordered far-right militants to physically harm him. ""The decision to grant me asylum saved my life,"" he said in an interview. 
The Norwegian appeals board that reviewed and approved Mr. Gawel's asylum application concluded that the purpose of the court case was to curtail his activities, and that he might be in danger if he returned to Poland. 
It found that Mr. Gawel risked ""political persecution from government officials, under the cover and appearance of a criminal case where the purpose has been to limit his freedom of speech and activity by imprisoning him, and possibly also discrediting him."" The conclusion, which was not made public by Norway, was read out to The New York Times by Lukasz Niedzielski, Mr. Gawel's lawyer. 
Gunnar Ekelove-Slydal, the acting secretary general at the Oslo-based Norwegian Helsinki Committee, a human rights organization, said Norway's decision was a clear sign of mounting concerns in Europe over democratic backsliding in Poland. 
""The trust toward the Polish judiciary among European states is falling apart,"" he said. 
But Poland's deputy minister of foreign affairs, Pawel Jablonski, said in an interview that Mr. Gawel's conviction was based on criminal charges. ""He was convicted by two courts,"" the minister said. ""We suspect that they might have been manipulated by his words,"" he added, referring to Norway's immigration services. 
Poland has in recent years been at loggerheads with its partners in Europe over concerns that its democracy is being undermined by the right-wing coalition led by the Law and Justice Party that took power in 2015. The government has actively worked to limit freedom of speech and L.G.B.T.Q. rights - and has also weakened judicial independence, assuming greater controls over the prosecutor's office and judges. 
""The ruling Law and Justice government has used the past five years to put the judiciary under its control, raising serious concerns about the independence of courts, judges and prosecutors,"" said Lydia Gall, a senior researcher on Eastern Europe at Human Rights Watch. 
The European Union has imposed modest sanctions on Poland, and several of the bloc's members have also taken individual actions in response. This year, Germany and the Netherlands refused to extradite Polish citizens who were under European arrest warrants to Poland over fears that they would not receive fair trials. 
Human rights experts said that Mr. Gawel's case was significant given how rarely E.U. citizens are granted asylum in other European countries. Of the tens of thousands of people to be granted asylum by Norway in the past decade, only 18 have been E.U. citizens, according to the country's immigration statistics. One Pole was given asylum last year, according to official statistics, but the human rights experts said they were not aware of that case. Norway usually does not provide details about specific asylum cases. 
Jakub Godzimirski, an expert on Polish-Norwegian relations at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs, said that some Poles applied for asylum after the end of Communist rule in Poland in the early 1990s, but that most were refused. 
""The threshold to get asylum from a European Union country in Norway is quite high,"" he said. 
In the interview, Mr. Gawel said he had left Poland by car even though his passport had been confiscated, and that the consular staff of a European country that he declined to identify had helped him and his family reach Norway. 
Mr. Gawel said that he and his wife, Karolina Krupa, got married just days before fleeing. ""We picked up the marriage certificate in the morning, just before leaving, and then got our car checked by wiretap and GPS experts,"" he said. ""We felt like refugees, and we were refugees."" 
Norway initially rejected his asylum request, but he appealed the decision and was granted refugee status on Sept. 30. 
In the interview, Mr. Gawel denied any wrongdoing and said he had presented the Norwegian immigration authorities with documents proving his innocence. 
""I was targeted because my organization exposed ties between local authorities, government figures and far-right groups,"" he said, adding that his group had lodged over 400 complaints about hate crimes committed in Poland this year. 
Mr. Gawel had also been at odds with a nonprofit group operating in Poland. Ewa Kulik-Bielinska, the head of the Stefan Batory Foundation, an independent foundation established by Mr. Soros, said Mr. Gawel had misused the equivalent of $20,000 of subsidies that it awarded him. 
Mr. Gawel attributed the incident to a difference with the foundation over the correct procedures for handling money. 
The judge who sentenced him in 2019 said in her ruling that Mr. Gawel had used loans and donations for his own aims. ""Disposing of public money requires transparency and honesty,"" said the judge, Alina Kaminska, according to Polish news reports. 
Mr. Gawel declined to show the documents granting him asylum when asked by The Times. The Norwegian Immigration Appeals Board confirmed that he had been granted asylum, but declined to comment on the specifics. 
Mr. Niedzielski, his lawyer, said he hoped Norway's decision would be ""a game changer"" in how European countries deal with Poland, although experts said it was unlikely to push the Polish government to change course. 
But, said Mr. Ekelove-Slydal, from the Norwegian Helsinki Committee, ""if such decisions are followed by concrete consequences, on economic cooperation or investments, then it could trigger new reflections on the courts in Poland."" 
""Trust in Poland's judiciary has been undermined,"" he said, ""which means that a fundamental pillar of European cooperation is threatened.""

177,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1251/Files (250).DOCX","Billboard",2020-07-03,"3439 words","NEWS; TAG","Steve Knopper",NA,"PWR BTTM’S Ben Hopkins Prepares to Release Solo Album & Put Sexual Misconduct Allegations Behind Them",FALSE,"Out of work as a musician, living in a tiny Brooklyn apartment and severely depressed, Ben Hopkins wrote an entire album in a windowless bedroom in late 2017. ""Somebody swallowed the sun/Now the morning never comes,"" Hopkins sings on ""Internet Song,"" which is built around a single G-chord that sounds like Kurt Cobain at his most furious. ""They put the Internet in the sky/Now I'll stare at it till I die.""
""I was in a really bad state of mental health - a complete state of suicidal ideation,"" says the former singer, guitarist and occasional drummer of the DIY punk duo PWR BTTM, staring into a webcam during a Skype video call. Hopkins, who is non-binary and uses they/them pronouns, pauses to remove a baseball cap and run a hand through a dark forelock before putting on a different cap. The song, they continue, is ""a keyhole into the true essence of what I was feeling. All of a sudden - in a weekend - this is my new reality forever because I've been canceled or whatever? This is what I have to look forward to until I’m dead?""
In early May 2017, Hopkins and bandmate Liv Bruce were poised for a career breakthrough. A week before PWR BTTM was to release its second album, Pageant, Vice's music site Noisey declared them ""America's Next Great Rock Band,"" and in the days that followed, NPR shined a spotlight on the duo by featuring an advance stream of the record on its website, The New York Times readied a profile, and Rufus Wainwright interviewed them for Billboard.
By mid-May, as Hopkins put it, PWR BTTM were canceled. A series of mostly anonymous social media posts accused Hopkins of rape, assault, ""inappropriate sexual contact,"" being a ""known sexual predator"" and ""an abuse apologist.""
The allegations, which materialized on May 11, the eve of Pageant's release date, were especially shocking given the safe community that PWR BTTM had built - and which Hopkins had often extolled onstage - as the band rose through New York's club scene and began to tour outside the city. ""For the queer community and the trans community, you can't just go anywhere and feel at home or feel accepted or feel seen,"" says Sarah Marloff, a Washington, D.C., writer who covers LGBTQ issues and sexual assault. ""I saw PWR BTTM and it felt safe. It felt fun. It felt like ours."" For some, the allegations against Hopkins felt like a betrayal of those ideals. ""It's hard when you're like, 'You made me trust you,' and I don't trust people easily,"" Marloff says. ""You were fighting for the right causes, and then you took advantage of someone."" She pauses, then adds: ""Allegedly.""
The women's lifestyle website Jezebel amplified the accusations in a May 12 story alleging Hopkins ""perpetrated multiple assaults, bullied other people in the queer community and…made unwanted advances towards underage minors.""
By May 15, PWR BTTM had been dropped by Polyvinyl Records, the label that was set to distribute Pageant. ""There is absolutely no place in the world for hate, violence, abuse, discrimination or predatory behavior of any kind,"" read the indie label's statement. ""In keeping with this philosophy, we want to let everyone know that we are ceasing to sell and distribute PWR BTTM's music."" The album was pulled from streaming platforms, and the band's first LP, Ugly Cherries, was also removed from distribution by another label. Salty Artist Management dropped the duo, the Hopscotch Festival canceled a scheduled showcase for the band, and PWR BTTM's tour was canceled after fellow indie artists Nnamdi Ogbonnaya, iji, T-Rextasy and Tancred dropped off the bill. T-Rextasy followed up with an elaborate Twitter thread, saying it had ""made a mistake supporting this band"" and ""we feel that we may not be the only ppl in this community to have heard these allegations before today.""
Later that fall, the #MeToo hashtag would go viral when the Times and The New Yorker after months of chasing down rumors, reluctant sources (and the details of at least one police investigation) published damning investigations into allegations of rape and other sexual misconduct against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. By comparison, Hopkins and PWR BTTM were canceled in the span of roughly one week based on a handful of anonymous allegations and tweets.
Other public figures with higher profiles and known accusers - Chris Brown, Robin Thicke, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and President Donald Trump, to name a few - have been allowed to carry on their careers despite allegations of sexual misconduct. The claims against Hopkins are unusual and frustrating, in part, because they're anonymous — and those who made them have chosen to remain silent. After more than three years of pondering the path forward, Hopkins is prepared to fight for a second chance. ""I am not guilty of this,"" they say, ""and I need to move on with my life.""
Hopkins says the 2017 allegations left them shocked, then numb. They consulted lawyers to determine if there was any legal recourse against the labels and managers that dropped the band, but decided against it, explaining, ""It was all very speculative, and I did not want to put my family through a $150,000 lawsuit.""
In the aftermath, Hopkins and Bruce separated, the former traveling to their hometown of Hamilton, Massachusetts, to live with their parents before returning to New York a few months later. This was a months-long period of ""very, very low moments and self-harm,"" Hopkins says. “I was not well. I felt like nothing existed.”
Eventually, Hopkins began to write music again, much of it inspired by the whiplash experience of PWR BTTM's abrupt cancellation and the emotions they experienced during that time.
The result is their solo debut, i held my breath for a really long time once.
Unlike PWR BTTM’s campy punk sound, with its shades of Tune-Yards and (even) They Might Be Giants, i held my breath roars with '90s guitars, set against Hopkins’ playful, theatrical and high-pitched voice. The lyrics are oblique and freighted with pain and weariness: ""Tired of being tired!"" Hopkins repeats throughout the talky, seven-and-a-half-minute ""Laugh Track,"" which is the album's first single. Another song, ""Sister,"" appears directed at someone who may have been involved in PWR BTTM's downfall:
Try and recall how it used to be
Before the summer
When there was a sense of possibility
And you and I like sisters
Everything felt alright
Little did I know about the fire on your mind
Now I am burning
Why in the hell were you lying?
The plan is to release the album sometime this fall. In the meantime, ""Laugh Track,"" which was released shortly after midnight on July 3, will serve as a test of sorts to see if fans of PWR BTTM will embrace Hopkins once again.
'I Felt Uncomfortable About the Energy They Were Giving Me’
 One person who contends Hopkins deserves a second hearing is their new manager, Lisa Barbaris, who for 20 years has represented LGBTQ heroine Cyndi Lauper. (Pose and Kinky Boots star Billy Porter is also a client.) Initially a fan of PWR BTTM, Barbaris says she was convinced Hopkins and Bruce were ""the first queer band that was really going to break that glass ceiling"" and become ""big, big stars."" (At one point, she attempted to book the duo on Lauper's annual True Colors United fundraiser for LGBTQ homeless youths, but they were too busy.)
Barbaris, who, with Lauper has lobbied politicians for years to combat hate crimes, workplace discrimination and ""don't ask, don't tell,"" was ""disappointed"" when she read about the accusations against PWR BTTM. She felt the band deserved due process. “They went from being adored to being hated,"" says Barbaris. ""It was also the beginning of #MeToo, which I 1,000% support,"" she adds. ""I believe women, but I believe Ben is telling the truth.”
Barbaris originally wanted Hopkins to write a first-person account of their 2017 experience as an op-ed for this outlet. Billboard's editors suggested instead a reported story in which Hopkins as well as their accusers would be given the opportunity to tell their respective accounts.
Hopkins agreed to be interviewed, and over the course of two Skype calls that totaled more than two hours, talked about the events that led to their and PWR BTTM's cancellation.
Hopkins, now 28, is skinny, with intense brown eyes, a long nose and a theatrical charisma suited for rock ‘n’ roll, but unlike PWR BTTM's heyday, when they would perform in tight, shiny dresses, their face smeared with colorful makeup and glitter, they appear on camera unadorned save for nail polish - a different color for each Skype session. During the interviews, Hopkins, at one point, changes sweaters mid-conversation, and, more than once, talks about the tattoos that peek out from underneath their t-shirt sleeves. There's one of Amy Winehouse and another of the playwright Charles Ludlam, who is name-checked in “Laugh Track.” (“Like Charles Ludlam/As he died of AIDS/As he thought of a script/To a brand new play”)
During the second Skype interview, Hopkins takes nearly 40 minutes to methodically recount the events that they say, led to the barrage of accusations in May 2017. Although it is more detailed, the account does not differ much from the one that Hopkins offered in a May 18 Facebook post.
PWR BTTM in 2013 after Hopkins and Bruce met at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson. Both had dressed in drag for a play there, and, as their friendship grew, Bruce, who was in the process of transitioning, floated the idea of starting an all-queer rock band. Hopkins, who says they didn't identify as queer until ""super late in life,"" responded, ""That sounds terrifying. Let's do it.""
PWR BTTM's ascent to indie stardom happened relatively quickly. The band's first album, 2015's Ugly Cherries, was critically acclaimed - NPR called the duo “a Trojan horse infiltrating rock stereotypes with inclusive, campy identity politics."" Meanwhile, their live shows - which established Hopkins and Bruce as descendants of The New York Dolls and rock's first openly trans singer Jayne County - began to sell out. Most media outlets referred to PWR BTTM's scene as ""queercore,"" but Hopkins associates that term with an earlier genre, covering '90s punk bands like Pansy Division. They prefer ""DIY hardcore.""
In March 2016, PWR BTTM toured the country, and like many up-and-coming indie bands, frequently stayed at supporters' houses while on the road. During a stop in the Midwest, one of those houses hosted a party for the band, where Hopkins met a woman who chatted with them amiably about punk bands. They exchanged phone numbers and she invited Hopkins to hang out at a local dog park the next day, then have brunch with friends.
They spent all day together, and after PWR BTTM's show that night, Hopkins says they received a 2 a.m. text from the woman inviting them to her house - where they hooked up, ""We had great, pleasurable sex on both sides with lots of communication, with both partners involved,"" the singer recalls. They kept in touch via text, and the woman later asked Hopkins if she could stay at their small Brooklyn apartment. Hopkins agreed, but says they were distracted with preparations for another series of live dates.
""As soon as they got there, I felt uncomfortable about the energy they were giving me,"" Hopkins says of the visitor, adding that gradually, their relationship strained. Initially, Hopkins says the woman initiated sex at the apartment, “but we stopped because I was uncomfortable."" When it's pointed out that this part of his account differs from the May 18 Facebook post, Hopkins says that over the next few days, they did have sex a number of times (which does jibe with the entry).
When PWR BTTM hit the road, Hopkins says the two continued to flirt via text and met briefly at one of PWR BTTM's New York shows. The woman was writing an online article about touring queer bands and, Hopkins says, requested their help. When the article posted, PWR BTTM was included with the acts Hopkins suggested.
'People Are Saying Stuff About You Online'
 In January 2017, Hopkins became the subject of a different kind of controversy they admit was self-inflicted. At 19, they had posed for a photo that depicted them smiling next to a swastika they had drawn on the beach. ""Back then, I thought being offensive was like being subversive, but in reality it just hurt people,"" Hopkins says. ""I was young and dumb and should have never done it.""
After the swastika photo hit the Internet, Hopkins says the woman remained friendly. She even asked them to intervene with another person that she accused of sexual harassment. (Hopkins says they provided guidance on how she should deal with the situation.)
Hopkins says they first learned of the allegations of sexual abuse and predatory behavior on May 6. While celebrating a friend's birthday at a New York City bar, a text arrived: “Hey, Ben,” it read, “people are saying stuff about you online.""
""I was completely and utterly blindsided,"" says Hopkins.
On May 12, the Jezebel article expanded upon the social media accusations, with the writer alleging Hopkins ""perpetrated multiple assaults, bullied other people in the queer community and…made unwanted advances towards underage minors."" The most serious and coherent charge centered on one encounter: Identified by the pseudonym “Jen,” the woman told Jezebel that, while intoxicated, Hopkins allegedly sexually assaulted her twice in one night and later sent her nude photos.
“I just felt totally powerless in the situation, first due to physicality because they are so much bigger than me in size - and also social status,"" said Jen.
Shortly after the Jezebel post, Hopkins read a Facebook entry mentioning the accuser's hometown and says they became convinced that Jen was the woman they had met at the Midwest house party. ""I was like, wait a minute, I didn’t bring this person back to my house like it says in the article. I went back to their house at their invitation,"" they say, then referring to their later rendezvous in New York, ""If I’m this big, [imposing] person who you don’t feel safe with, why do you want to come stay at my house?""
The floodgates opened. Although the only specific allegations against Hopkins came from the pseudonymous Jen, a Chicago punk scene regular named Kitty Cordero-Kolin began tweeting what she claimed were others' anonymous complaints about Hopkins. ""Ben has violated their autonomy and or consent,"" read one; another, ""they abused a lot of my friends."" One of the quotes Cordero-Kolin passed along accused Hopkins' father of making ""inappropriate advances on women."" An anonymous accuser opened a Twitter account, @PWRBTTMReceipts, to respond to everything the band’s principals said or did.
Hopkins and Bruce arranged a conference call with their manager Jeanette Wall to write a response that, Hopkins says, wouldn't antagonize the accusers. They would end up posting two statements on Facebook page. In the first, dated May 11, Hopkins and Bruce said they were trying to address the allegations against Ben ""with openness and accountability,"" later writing, ""Our primary goal here is to ensure that a survivor of abuse has a voice, that their story should be heard and that people who cross the line should be held accountable.""
In the May 18 Facebook entry, Hopkins indicated that they knew who the accuser was. ""While I am open to understanding this person's perspective, I strongly contest the account put forth in Jezebel, read their statement but stopped short of an unequivocal denial that would have contradicted PWR BTTM's message that the safety of its fans was paramount. ""That being said,"" the post concluded, ""in keeping with my commitment to my principles, I believe it is my responsibility to be accountable to this individual's perspective and to honor it accordingly.""
""I was catatonic at this point"" and ""didn't contribute much"" to the statement,"" Hopkins says of its mixed message. ""I was just sort of reading and approving things.""
The Facebook posts seemed to frustrate the band's followers and fuel their detractors. More than 1,400 people commented on the posts. ""There is literally no proof either way [at the moment] so talking utter shite in the comment section trying to discredit this band is equally groundless,"" wrote one. Responded another: ""just because it hasnt been public doesnt mean there isnt proof! haha lol.""
Billboard's numerous, repeated attempts to present the accounts of these accusers as well as those of the music-industry representatives that dropped PWR BTTM were met largely with silence. The person who leveled the charges of sexual abuse did respond by email, but after expressing anger that Billboard was working on a story about Hopkins, declined to speak on the record.
Cordero-Kolin did not respond to emails and voicemails. Polyvinyl president and co-founder Matt Lunsford said in a statement, ""All matters between Polyvinyl and PWR BTTM were amicably resolved in August 2017,"" when the label allowed Bruce and Hopkins, with the help of an attorney, to buy the rights to Pageant. The band’s former lawyer, Jeff Koenig, did not respond, nor did former manager Jeanette Wall, former agent Josh Lindgren or Jessi Frick, founder of indie label Father/Daughter, which put out PWR BTTM's 2015 album Ugly Cherries.
Bruce also chose not to comment. Hopkins and Bruce fell out in 2017, because, Hopkins says, Bruce talked to Hopkins' accuser at one point without telling his then bandmate. Hopkins felt betrayed, but says today: “I’m not here to drag Liv Bruce. She was in a really hard situation.” Barbaris, when asked what the chances were of PWR BTTM getting back together, says, “They discussed it, but we have to get through this first. We’ve got to see where Liv’s head is in a year or two.""
The rest of the acts that dropped off of PWR BTTM's ill-fated 2017 tour wouldn't comment - with the exception of Zach Burba of Seattle's iji. “It was confusing and disappointing and it just didn’t seem like the tour could go forward with all of the things people were saying,” he says, adding, ""I felt then, as I do now, that the best move was to simply listen to what people were saying.”
'Every Allegation Needs to Be Looked at Seriously and Critically'
 Thanks in large part to the #MeToo movement, which was founded by activist Tarana Burke in 2006 (and went viral in 2017 when actress Alyssa Milano began using it as a hashtag for her tweets about Harvey Weinstein), accusations of sexual abuse and predatory behavior increasingly provoke civil lawsuits, criminal investigations, and survivors going on the record with the backing of friends and family.
The allegations against Hopkins come with no such documentation, but as Debra Katz - the attorney who represented Brett Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford and works on other prominent #MeToo cases ― points out, “People don’t typically lie about these allegations."" If it happens, she says, it happens in ""a very small percentage of cases.""
""Every allegation needs to be looked at seriously and critically,"" says Katz, although she adds that it's very difficult for journalists to write about anonymous allegations. “It puts you in a pretty hard place. You have [one] person saying this stuff happened and [the other] denying it, and you can’t quite adjudicate it.”
'That Sounds Like The Name of Your Record'
 Hopkins returned to Brooklyn on July 4, 2017, and reluctantly adjusted to life beneath the radar. They live with a girlfriend, Phoebe Herland, who, like Bruce, Hopkins met at Bard. They worked for a catering company and as a bartender at a favorite local club. Hopkins is the Dungeon Master for a weeklyDungeons & Dragons group, which also serves as a sort of support group, encouraging Hopkins to write new songs.
""I believe Ben. Of course I believe Ben. I wouldn’t be friends with Ben if I didn’t believe them,"" says Shelby, one of Hopkins' fellow Dungeons & Dragons players, who asked that her last name not be used. ""When a group of people operate in a groupthink way, things can get out of hand. I'm just so sad that it happened to Ben.""
Hopkins, who wears a red D&D T-shirt and 10-sided-dice earrings during one of the Skype sessions, says the games, which have continued during the pandemic, are therapeutic and led to the title of the album. ""'I held my breath for a really long time once' was something I said while playing and everybody said, 'That sounds like the name of your record, given what you've been through,"" says Hopkins.
Asked what Hopkins hopes the album will accomplish, the singer-songwriter stares off camera for a long time. “I was expunging so much pain in that music,"" they say finally. ""I hope it makes people feel less alone.""

The antiracism activist fled on New Year's Eve in 2018 with his wife and toddler, seeking refuge in Norway, which has long welcomed political refugees from desperate corners of the world. 
 But the activist, Rafal Gawel, wasn't escaping a war-torn country. He was fleeing Poland, a member of the democratic and peaceful European Union. Although his initial request for asylum in Norway was rejected, last month an appeals board there granted his request.
 It was a dramatic chain of events that underscored concerns elsewhere in Europe that Poland's democracy -- once regarded as a great success story of the post-Soviet era -- has regressed under the right-wing coalition that has ruled the country for the past five years.
 While Mr. Gawel's case is complicated, the asylum decision reflected worries about political influence in the Polish judicial system. Norway's immigration service said it had granted him asylum on the grounds that he faced political persecution in Poland, a rare instance of a country in Europe offering such protection to a citizen of the European Union. Norway is not a member of the bloc, but maintains close relations with it.
 A controversial and well-known artist and human rights activist in Poland, Mr. Gawel, 47, is a complicated figure at the center of an international tussle over democratic rights. He has had legal troubles in Poland, fleeing the country just before being sentenced to prison for two years for fraud and misappropriation of funds.
 He says, without providing evidence, that the charges against him were an effort by Poland's government to rein him in and that the trial was rigged.
 The Polish government has noted that the fraud charges were brought against him under a previous, more centrist administration in 2013. And a nonprofit group in Poland funded by the financier George Soros has accused Mr. Gawel of mismanaging funds that it allocated to his organization, the Center for Monitoring Racist and Xenophobic Behavior. Those charges were used in the court case against him.
 Mr. Gawel said that Poland's government had targeted him over his work documenting a growing number of hate crimes in the country, and that it had ordered far-right militants to physically harm him. ''The decision to grant me asylum saved my life,'' he said in an interview.
 The Norwegian appeals board that reviewed and approved Mr. Gawel's asylum application concluded that the purpose of the court case was to curtail his activities, and that he might be in danger if he returned to Poland.
 It found that Mr. Gawel risked ''political persecution from government officials, under the cover and appearance of a criminal case where the purpose has been to limit his freedom of speech and activity by imprisoning him, and possibly also discrediting him.'' The conclusion, which was not made public by Norway, was read out to The New York Times by Lukasz Niedzielski, Mr. Gawel's lawyer.
 Gunnar Ekelove-Slydal, the acting secretary general at the Oslo-based Norwegian Helsinki Committee, a human rights organization, said Norway's decision was a clear sign of mounting concerns in Europe over democratic backsliding in Poland.
 ''The trust toward the Polish judiciary among European states is falling apart,'' he said.
 But Poland's deputy minister of foreign affairs, Pawel Jablonski, said in an interview that Mr. Gawel's conviction was based on criminal charges. ''He was convicted by two courts,'' the minister said. ''We suspect that they might have been manipulated by his words,'' he added, referring to Norway's immigration services.
 Poland has in recent years been at loggerheads with its partners in Europe over concerns that its democracy is being undermined by the right-wing coalition led by the Law and Justice Party that took power in 2015. The government has actively worked to limit freedom of speech and L.G.B.T.Q. rights -- and has also weakened judicial independence, assuming greater controls over the prosecutor's office and judges.
 ''The ruling Law and Justice government has used the past five years to put the judiciary under its control, raising serious concerns about the independence of courts, judges and prosecutors,'' said Lydia Gall, a senior researcher on Eastern Europe at Human Rights Watch.
 The European Union has imposed modest sanctions on Poland, and several of the bloc's members have also taken individual actions in response. This year, Germany and the Netherlands refused to extradite Polish citizens who were under European arrest warrants to Poland over fears that they would not receive fair trials.
 Human rights experts said that Mr. Gawel's case was significant given how rarely E.U. citizens are granted asylum in other European countries. Of the tens of thousands of people to be granted asylum by Norway in the past decade, only 18 have been E.U. citizens, according to the country's immigration statistics. One Pole was given asylum last year, according to official statistics, but the human rights experts said they were not aware of that case. Norway usually does not provide details about specific asylum cases.
 Jakub Godzimirski, an expert on Polish-Norwegian relations at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs, said that some Poles applied for asylum after the end of Communist rule in Poland in the early 1990s, but that most were refused.
 ''The threshold to get asylum from a European Union country in Norway is quite high,'' he said.
 In the interview, Mr. Gawel said he had left Poland by car even though his passport had been confiscated, and that the consular staff of a European country that he declined to identify had helped him and his family reach Norway.
 Mr. Gawel said that he and his wife, Karolina Krupa, got married just days before fleeing. ''We picked up the marriage certificate in the morning, just before leaving, and then got our car checked by wiretap and GPS experts,'' he said. ''We felt like refugees, and we were refugees.''
 Norway initially rejected his asylum request, but he appealed the decision and was granted refugee status on Sept. 30.
 In the interview, Mr. Gawel denied any wrongdoing and said he had presented the Norwegian immigration authorities with documents proving his innocence.
 ''I was targeted because my organization exposed ties between local authorities, government figures and far-right groups,'' he said, adding that his group had lodged over 400 complaints about hate crimes committed in Poland this year.
 Mr. Gawel had also been at odds with a nonprofit group operating in Poland. Ewa Kulik-Bielinska, the head of the Stefan Batory Foundation, an independent foundation established by Mr. Soros, said Mr. Gawel had misused the equivalent of $20,000 of subsidies that it awarded him.
 Mr. Gawel attributed the incident to a difference with the foundation over the correct procedures for handling money.
 The judge who sentenced him in 2019 said in her ruling that Mr. Gawel had used loans and donations for his own aims. ''Disposing of public money requires transparency and honesty,'' said the judge, Alina Kaminska, according to Polish news reports.
 Mr. Gawel declined to show the documents granting him asylum when asked by The Times. The Norwegian Immigration Appeals Board confirmed that he had been granted asylum, but declined to comment on the specifics.
 Mr. Niedzielski, his lawyer, said he hoped Norway's decision would be ''a game changer'' in how European countries deal with Poland, although experts said it was unlikely to push the Polish government to change course.
 But, said Mr. Ekelove-Slydal, from the Norwegian Helsinki Committee, ''if such decisions are followed by concrete consequences, on economic cooperation or investments, then it could trigger new reflections on the courts in Poland.''
 ''Trust in Poland's judiciary has been undermined,'' he said, ''which means that a fundamental pillar of European cooperation is threatened.''

179,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1251/Files (250).DOCX","Politico.com",2020-06-10,"1880 words","POLITICOPICKS",NA,NA,"The Short, Fraught History of the 'Thin Blue Line' American Flag",FALSE,"As protests over policing continue to convulse cities throughout the U.S., one symbol keeps showing up: a black-and-white American flag with one blue stripe. 
Recently, the flag was flown from the back of a car alongside protests in South Dakota, and burned outside the Utah State Capitol. When deputies hoisted the flag outside government buildings in Cincinnati, Ohio, and Orange, California, the sheriffs in both communities were sharply criticized. Officers have worn versions of the flag on face masks while clashing with protesters in Baltimore and Washington, D.C. 
Those who fly the flag have said it stands for solidarity and professional pride within a dangerous, difficult profession and a solemn tribute to fallen police officers. But it has also been flown by white supremacists, appearing next to Confederate flags at the 2017 'Unite the Right' rally in Charlottesville. County officials in Oregon recently paid $100,000 to a black employee of a law enforcement agency there, after she said she was harassed by co-workers for complaining about her colleagues displaying the flag at work. 
Now, as police again become the focal point of a fight for racial equality in the U.S., the flag has returned to both mirror and amplify divisions. 
But how did this flag come to be so pervasive? And what does it really stand for?
In 2014, a white college student named Andrew Jacob was watching protests of police killings of Eric Garner, Michael Brown and Tamir Rice. He had seen the image of the flag on patches and stickers, he told The Marshall Project, but not an actual flag. While in high school in West Bloomfield, Michigan, he had attended a memorial service for a police officer who had been killed on the job. 
Now, Jacob is the president of Thin Blue Line USA, one of the largest online retailers devoted exclusively to sales of pro-police flags, T-shirts, neckwear and jewelry. ""The flag has no association with racism, hatred, bigotry,"" he said. ""It's a flag to show support for law enforcement-no politics involved."" The company officially disavowed its use in Charlottesville. 
Jacob said the flag was not a direct reaction to the first Black Lives Matter protests-an idea suggested by a previous origin story in Harper's-but he allows he may have first seen the thin blue line image after those protests spurred the circulation of pro-police imagery online. ""That's maybe why it came to my eyes,"" he said. 
As Jacob built the company, a ""Blue Lives Matter"" movement was growing in the wake of news stories of multiple officers shot to death in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Brooklyn, New York; and Dallas, Texas. Meanwhile, Donald Trump, as a presidential candidate, called police ""the force between civilization and total chaos."" Some states began passing laws to categorize physical attacks on law enforcement officers as hate crimes.
Police were not actually in greater danger than they had been before the Black Lives Matter movement. Ambush killings of police have actually declined more than 90 percent since 1970, even with the recent spikes, according to a study by Michael White, a professor of criminology at Arizona State University. White understands how the thin blue line flag has become a part of police culture, and that officers may view it as a sign of solidarity, but he also worries about the message it sends to the public. 
""It fosters this 'us versus them' mentality,"" he said. ""The police and community together should work together, in order to produce safety. Each should respect the role of the other. If you're looking at the community as a potential enemy, or a threat, that's certainly going to hinder any positive relationship."" 
Before the flag came the phrase. 
The idea of a ""thin blue line"" can be traced all the way back to an 1854 British battle formation, a ""thin red line"" used during the Crimean War and then popularized in art, poetry and song. According to lawyers James Clapp and Elizabeth Thornburg, who have dug up the history behind popular phrases, the idea migrated to other professions, with other colors, from a ""thin white line of bishops"" to a ""thin blue line of public schoolboys in blazers."" 
It was occasionally used for police, they write. But that usage caught on in 1922, after New York police commissioner Richard Enright, facing criticism of his leadership, mentioned it in a public relations effort. The phrase started showing up in speeches by politicians and related news coverage from Chicago to Los Angeles. 
In the 1950s, ""The Thin Blue Line"" was the title of a short-lived television show about the Los Angeles Police Department, masterminded by the chief, William H. Parker, who took advantage of Hollywood's proximity to make public relations a key part of his tenure. He also opened up the department's files to the writers of ""Dragnet."" 
Parker was known for unambiguous racism. He said some immigrants were ""not far removed from the wild tribes of Mexico"" and compared black residents participating in the 1965 Watts Riots-which stemmed in part from anger over his own department's mistreatment-to ""monkeys in a zoo."" 
Parker used the phrase ""thin blue line"" constantly in his speeches. The phrase was further popularized by the novels of Joseph Wambaugh, himself a former police officer in Los Angeles, and it typified Parker's philosophy: Having served in the military, he wanted to end corruption and professionalize the police force. 
In his view, the police ""protected Western civilization from communists, progressive politicians, minorities, anybody who agitated for something that didn't fit his very narrow scheme,"" said Alisa Kramer, who wrote a 2007 dissertation on Parker's tenure. ""There are a lot of parallels between Parker and Trump; Parker had no understanding of the complexities of poverty and racism."" 
After Parker's sudden death in 1966, the city named the police headquarters after him. The Parker Center went on to be a primary site of protests in 1992 after the acquittal of the police officers who beat Rodney King. 
Parker's tenure augured a bigger shift toward militarism in police departments, which came to buy military gear directly from the Department of Defense. Criminologists Don L. Kurtz and Alayna Colburn have analyzed the language police officers use in formal interviews, and argue that the ""thin blue line"" idea is an example of popular culture informing internal police culture, highlighting ""the assumed differences between officers and citizens and further progresses an 'us versus them' mentality among officers."" 
The phrase gained another boost with Errol Morris' 1988 film ""The Thin Blue Line,"" in which a Dallas judge quotes a prosecutor describing what separates ""the public from anarchy."" The title was ironic, if not sly, since the film depicted how law enforcement sent an innocent man to death row. 
Over the years, officers around the country occasionally placed stickers of a blue line surrounded by black on their cars. After the ambush of Dallas officers in 2016, the flag became a common sight in yards and on bumper stickers around the city, along with ""Back the Blue"" and ""Thank a Cop"" signs. Mourners wore blue neckties and hair ribbons at the funeral service, but the fallen officers' caskets were draped with American flags. 
Dallas Police Sgt. Stephen Bishopp has a doctorate degree and has studied police stress, use of force and officer misconduct. The ""thin blue line"" symbol existed before several of his colleagues were gunned down by a sniper in July 2016, he said. To him, it symbolizes respect and understanding for the families of officers killed in the line of duty-including suicides. 
""When I see that flag as a sticker on a car or flying in someone's yard, I know that there is someone there that knows what I'm going through. They know because they are a part of the family,"" Bishopp said. ""I don't really care if it bothers people or hurts their feelings to see that flag. I absolutely could care less. I am proud of what I do, the people I work with, and the ones who have died defending the rights of strangers. I will continue to fly that flag until my very last day.""
Social media allows for endless remixing, and the offerings now appear infinite. You can buy a sticker that mixes the imagery with the Disney World logo. You can buy a dog tag necklace, with Matthew 5:9 engraved on the back: ""Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God."" Law enforcement officers can buy a special edition Sig Sauer pistol covered with the flag and blue line. 
But as the images have multiplied, so have the meanings. The American flag and blue line have often been blended with the image of a skull associated with the Punisher comic book hero. A Marine turned vigilante who first appeared in Marvel comics in 1974, the Punisher fought crime through extrajudicial murder and torture. ""Police should not be embracing a criminal as their symbol,"" the character's creator, Gerry Conway, told Syfy Wire last year. ""In a way, it's as offensive as putting a Confederate flag on a government building."" 
Although the flag's manufacturers have tried to keep politics away from the flag, the current protests over the death of George Floyd have thrust the image into larger debates. In Cold Spring, New York, local leaders debated last week whether placing a decal of the flag on a police car would make some people afraid to ask officers for help. In Montclair, New Jersey, a police leader begged residents on a Zoom call not to view the flag as a ""symbol of racism.""
""We've seen trucks riding around with big old versions,"" said Melina Abdullah, a co-founder of the Los Angeles chapter of Black Lives Matter, about the protests in recent days. ""It feels akin to a Confederate flag."" She has also noticed the flag's image on police and other government-owned vehicles, and she sees this as evidence that even self-described liberal officials are not doing enough to combat white supremacy. ""The supposed 'liberal' answer to Donald Trump has not been as critical of police violence as it should be,"" she said.
Police officers themselves are also not speaking uniformly about the flag. Last month, San Francisco's chief of police, Bill Scott, banned his officers from wearing face masks emblazoned with the thin blue line flag, worrying they would be seen as ""divisive and disrespectful."" The masks had been distributed by the local police union, which accused the department of failing to provide masks. ""We did it as a morale booster for each other,"" union president Tony Montoya said, ""not as a political statement.""
Local skirmishes and letters to the editor in various states have questioned whether the thin blue line flag is a violation of the U.S. Flag Code, which specifically states: ""The flag should never have placed upon it, nor any part of it, nor attached to it any mark, insignia, letter, word, figure, design, picture, or drawing of any nature."" 
Despite that language, the American flag is depicted in many other ways for a number of purposes, many commercial. Still, the American Legion, which played a key role in drafting the Flag Code and is the go-to authority on proper U.S. flag etiquette, has not taken an official position yet on the black-and-white version with a blue line, a spokesman told The Marshall Project."
180,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1251/Files (250).DOCX","CE Latin America Migration English",2020-09-04,"2222 words",NA,"The New York Times",NA,"How Latinos Can Win Cultural War",FALSE," FIRST OF ALL, WHITE CONTENT CURATORS HAVE TO STOP ACCUMULATING POWER.
The story about Latinos in America is old... and false. Invented several generations ago by white men to demonize Mexicans and then Puerto Ricans, the racist caricature of Latinos that shows us as a menacing foreign monolith persists, even though two-thirds of us were born here and together came from more than 20 different countries.
Although we can be seen in every corner of this country, from big cities to small towns, Latinos shine through our absence from America's media and culture, which makes us vulnerable. President Donald Trump knows this and exploits these fictions for his political benefit.
Trump has accomplices. Curators of what is communicated in the media, art and entertainment have long excluded or misrepresented Latinos, particularly indigenous or black Latinos, which has helped build the cultural scaffolding of today's government. To neutralize these old fallacies, we need to go after their facilitators and transform the power structures in culture and the media, as well as spread and defend Latino storytellers. We must show our power as a community.
Rep. Joaquín Castro of Texas spoke about this in a recent column for Variety: ""There is a dangerous link between racist political rhetoric and negative images of Latinos as criminals and invaders that Americans see on their screens."" Castro added: ""Hollywood needs to recognize and address its systemic injustice and exclusion from our communities.""
In reality, the entire cultural and media industry must be held accountable, as must advertisers and investors who finance their actions.
We often say ""culture heals."" But America's cultural industry, which generates seductive images that rumble around the world, is among the main culprits for creating Latino stereotypes. Latinos buy more movie tickets per capita than any other group, but in the 1200 highest-grossing films released between 2007 and 2018, Latinos made up only 3 percent of the leading or secondary cast (and we're 19 percent of the population).
When we are on screen, we are usually represented in very limited ways. A 2019 Opportunity Agenda report revealed that only 25 percent of television characters who are Latino immigrants were presented as employed, while 88 percent were represented as prisoners or criminals. With no alternative stories about ordinary Latinos, Trump's narratives convince an audience influenced by Netflix's ""Narcos"" series.
White elites cannot silence an immense and vibrant community for decades and hope that does not have consequences. For Latinos in the Trump era, those consequences are deadly and have manifested themselves in events such as Hurricane Maria, the Walmart shooting in El Paso and the pandemic, as well as the large increase in hate crimes.
Latin artists and organizers are leading the way. In the publishing world, 3 percent of employees in 2018 were Latino, a statistic that helps understand the industry's surprise when the Latino community was outraged by stereotypes in the novel ""AmericanDirt."" The movement led by writers Dignidad Literaria and Latinx in Publishing are organizing to require the industry to tell Latin stories, and to tell them well.
Protests by Chican activists when Disney attempted to record the phrase ""Day of the Dead"" were instrumental in making the film ""Coco"" a culturally clever box office hit. Whether to shape a film or cancel its production, protests and boycotts accompanied by strategic support for alternatives can work.
Much has been written about the toxicity of drug stereotypes, and people in the industry have also been organizing against them. Latinos can learn from Color of Change, an organization that investigated how police television shows misrepresent the image of the black community and campaigned to eliminate such programs, resulting in the cancellation of the series ""Cops."" The strength of bad publicity and people's power should never be underestimated.
Facts are as important as fictations. In the mid-19th century, when mobs of white people lynched Mexicans, the Spanish-language media covered those murders, triggering public protests and eventually bringing about change. Latino journalists such as Rubén Salazar (killed by a Los Angeles County police officer during the Chicana Moratorium 50 years ago), Juan González, Roberto Lovato, Sonia Nazario, Maria Hinojosa and Tanzina Vega have played heroic roles, but there are very few of them, particularly within the genre of opinion articles.
This means that we do not set the national agenda, so many assaults on members of our community, from police abuse to wage theft, never come to light. The mobilization work inside and outside the newsrooms is the main reason why the main media outlets in this country have begun to represent the population they cover, as well documented by Juan González and Joe Torres' indispensable book, ""News for All the People"".
If an American media outlet does not currently have several Latin writers, editors, and columnists, it should be ashamed and start hiring them; the stains must be public and visible; the NFL's Rooney rule, which requires each football team to interview non-organization color candidates when they are looking for people for important positions, must be implemented across the industry; credits, articles, sources and salaries should be examined. Just 13 percent of the Los Angeles Times editorial is Latino, in a city where nearly 50 percent of its population is Latino. As a result of the organization of the newspaper's syndicate and its Latino board, the newspaper's owner pledged to make 25 percent of its staff Latino in the next five years.
Exclusion history is extensive. Latinos have been left out of prestigious publications that confer authority, awards and editorial contracts. New York City has about 30 percent Latinos, or about 2.5 million stories to tell. However, on its contributors page, The New Yorker magazine does not appear to have a single Latino registered; the magazine refused to confirm or deny this. Thanks to the publication's union, some inequalities in the newsroom have been addressed in recent times. The New Yorker should also take care of fixingracial inequalities so that excluded groups, including Latinos (particularly non-white Latinos), are hired as high-level editors and writers, so that the magazine can cover New York with credibility.
Financiers and investors seeking to build Latino power must understand that information is an essential community infrastructure. They should invest in independent Latino journalism such as Futuro Media Group, L.A. Taco, Revista Étnica, Conecta Arizona, 80grados, Radio Ambulante and Latino Rebels instead of always funding ""diversified"" but never ""diverse"" organizations.
Mexican-American critic Shea Serrano's individual media empire is a model. Serrano created a scholarship to support emerging Latino journalists.
Spanish journalism should also be supported: the Center for Investigative Journalism in Puerto Rico played a crucial role in overthrowing Governor Ricardo Roselló imagine if we had an expert team of Latino researchers dissecting Washington. Cultural criticism, auditing journalism and the opportunity to tell our own stories are fundamental aspects of building our collective identity and confronting injustices.
Imagination is also essential. When you sleep with one eye open, it's hard to dream. That's why our art is a survival strategy. That was seen in abundant quantities in ""Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA"", a series of exhibitions throughout the city in 2017, funded by the Getty Foundation. Getty's support allowed The La Raza newspaper and the University of California, Los Angeles Chicano Studies Research Center to organize 25,000 images from his file to offer an electrifying privileged view of the Chicano movement of the 1970s.
At the Central Library in Los Angeles, the Oaxacan collective Tlacolulokos painted a wonderful mural depicting contemporary Zapotec indigenous culture, which replaced the old library mural made in 1933 that showed Native Americans kneeling before European colonizers. Although there were some problems with Getty's initiative—on many occasions he prioritized white Latin American artists rather than Latin American artists of color—his ambition and magnitude was exciting.
We need much more: every major museum must commit to a similar initiative over the next three years, and staff and members of museum boards, particularly curators, must be a reflection of the cities in which they operate or forgo public and private funding.
Imagine Hollywood following the example of ""Pacific Standard Time"": producing an Oaxacan blockbuster film based on Tlacolulokos murals; a futuristic Afro-Medieval fantasy; a drama about the Chicano movement; a Guatemalan friends' comedy. What if one summer all the blockbuster movies were starring Latin stars saving cities, planets, people, aliens?
""Pacific Standard Time"" brought Latin artists and art organizations from the periphery to the center of the Los Angeles art conversation and demonstrated its dynamism. Let's be clear: Latinos haven't been ignored because they're uns interesting.
But with or without access to gallery walls, Latinos have come up with ways to make their art and get an audience. On Instagram,fascinating tells @Veteranas_and_Rucas celebrates Los Angeles Latinas with photographs and stories. Its creator, Guadalupe Rosales, has built a community of 257,000 followers that gives visibility to women who are rarely celebrated outside their community.
Its popularity highlights the pleasures of delighting ourselves, at a time when our exuberance feels like a burden. ""New Yorkers,"" by Djali Brown-Cepeda, does something similar with New York Latinos. It tells stories of longings and migrations. These initiatives promote communities, shake the country's amnesia with Latinos, and reveal our thirst to see us. We need to support more self-representation projects that achieve the same thing, from podcasts to public art.
All these initiatives are important. However, the stories we tell once we have the microphone in front of us are fundamental. Throughout Latin America, racial discourse is a mixture of indigenous, African and European roots, but those who tend to be favored are the ones that seem more European and have a lighter skin color. That is a problem that has generated criticism against Spanish-language channels such as Univision and Telemundo by community-based organizations such as Mijente.
The fact that many Latinos, particularly white and light-skinned, are reluctant to talk about how white privilege works in our own communities means they are silencing indigenous and black Latinos. This internal suppression reinforces the external. We must dismantle white supremacy in English and Spanish, and ensure that indigenous and black Latinos appear on screen, are behind the cameras, and run television shows and newsrooms.
In order to restructure cultural power, Latinos must press from every angle. They must challenge advertisers, a tactic they Presente.org others used to get anti-latino Lou Dobbs out of CNN. Shareholder activism is another option: with at least $2000 in public company shares, a proposal can be put forward that expresses concerns about a company's practices for its investors to vote for or against.
This could mean having to invest in media and entertainment companies to combat problematic practices or partner with investor networks such as the Interfaith Corporate Responsibility Center to shape their priorities around racial justice. For too long Latinos have been excluded by corporations that decide how we are represented; shareholder strategies have a track record of making companies uncomfortable and generating change. What if we could not be perceived as victims of culture but as its owners?
Latinos have been fighting white supremacy since California was part of Mexico. In recent months, 21 percent of Hispanic voters claimed to have participated in Black Lives Matter protests, for example. From the days of Arturo Schomburg, the Afro-Puerto Rican academic pioneer, to those of the friendship between the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. and César Chavez, as well as the Young Lords and the Black Panthers, black and Latino communities have mingled—according to one study, 25 percent of Latinos identify as Afro-Latins—and have worked together to get justice (of course , there are also Latinos who support Trump). Today's protests are important, but we also need to deconstruct the cultural context thatbrought it here.
We are the second largest ethnic group in this country. Many of us were already here before the ancestors of many people who call themselves Americans. Others came as victims of colonial experiments, covert operations, and U.S. trade agreements.
No matter how or when we get here, this country should be grateful to the Latino community: during this pandemic, the workers of the camp, 80 percent of whom are Latino, have put food on our tables. A large number of Latino workers from other sectors have also underpinned this country, often paying a high personal price.
America must accept the fact that Latinos are essential to their survival and splendor and that they have been for generations. We as Latinos need to know, too."

That law was cited by a southeast Georgia prosecutor who argued there was insufficient probable cause to issue arrest warrants for Travis and Gregory McMichael in the killing of black jogger Ahmad Arbery. It authorizes any Georgian who thinks they saw someone committing a felony to detain that person. Even Georgians who imagine this state in 2020 is the Wild West.

And that of Breonna Taylor, killed by police in her home in Louisville, Ky. And George Floyd; four Minneapolis police officers face charges including murder in his death. Credit: Kemet Alston of Divrs Media About two hours after the Dems' caucus announcement, a press release arrived signed by three state House Democrats and two Republicans announcing their support for the same repeal, making it a bipartisan effort. Street protests against police brutality are also helping build support in the state Legislature to increase penalties for crimes found beyond a reasonable doubt to be motivated by racism or other hates. The state House OK'd a hate crimes bill in March 2019, though it has since sat in the state Senate without action. But with even a big business lobby[2] now pushing for House Bill 426[3] now, its chances seems stronger by the day. On the local level, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms has put together a committee to review police use-of-force policy. And more policy changes or ideas may come as she and Atlanta City Council leaders identify and meet with protest leaders. Some professors and veteran political observers say this time[4] the protests feel different[5], or this time[6] real change is coming. But if that's true, it's liable to feel slow. Fulton DA Paul Howard was criticized in a campaign forum last week[7] facing longstanding anger over the lack of indictments (or other resolution) for police officers in three civilian deaths. As of Thursday, Bottoms and her office were working on identifying representatives of protestors in Atlanta's streets and setting up meetings to hear demands. Bottoms said anecdotally said from her own observations, she's heard several demands, such as setting up a citizen police review board. As she pointed out in a call with Atlanta City Council Thursday, the city does have a citizen police review board[8] that hears and investigates public complaints about the police. It's a legacy of the 2006 police killing of 92-year-old Kathryn Johnston. And police are free to ignore the board's recommendations. Atlanta is serious about closing its jail and turning it into a center for equity[9]. But in the meantime, police used it for processing more than 200 people arrested mainly for curfew violations or being in the street during protests. Atlanta is already doing some of the best practices[10] meant to build relationships with communities. Like opening At-Promise Centers for young folks[11]. And encouraging cops to live where they police. But Atlanta is only one little piece of the state, about 20 miles across. https://s3.amazonaws.com/saportakinsta/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ATLProtests_11.jpg A protestor at the Georgia Capitol this weekend. Credit: Kelly Jordan All of Georgia's 159 counties have a sheriff's office. Many cities have their own police too. And then there are university campus police, MARTA police and a bunch of state agencies with law enforcement powers too. All of them have different funding sources, bosses and practices. The state Capitol is patrolled by state law enforcement. One of their jobs? Standing shoulder-to-shoulder to protect a statue of a Confederate general[12]. And inside that Republican-run Capitol, Democrats have filed unsuccessful hate crimes legislation almost every term since 2005. (The version that was successful in the House this year is authored by a Republican from blue-turning Gwinnett County.) The two state House Republicans who made a point of saying they want to repeal citizen's arrest are fairly low-ranking. Neither chairs any of the key committees that would probably hear such a bill. Its prospects aren't good for the 11 working days left in this legislative year. Even a Republican governor, Nathan Deal, took baby steps over eight years from 2011 in a Capitol he dominated to pass his marquee criminal justice legislation that emphasizes rehabilitation over prison. So what to do? As protests started last week, Mayor Bottoms called on folks to vote. (If you missed June 9, that's OK. Register and be ready[13] for the November general election.) And whatever your passion is, there's liable to be a group working for it. Like Women on the Rise[14] for decarceration. Folks who know the exhausting intricacies of jurisdiction lines, public funding, who to lobby, where to find allies, when it's time for a lawsuit. Getting involved is the only way to make any revolution move any faster.

From a Foundation for Individual Rights in Education post last week:
On June 3, rising senior Austin Tong posted to his Instagram account a photo of David Dorn, a retired St. Louis police captain killed by looters in the unrest following the killing of George Floyd. The photo included the caption, Y all a bunch of hypocrites, a reference to Tong s frustration, as a supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement, with what he refers to as the nonchalant societal reaction over [Dorn s] death. 
The following day, June 4, was the 31st anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre of pro-democracy activists. Tong, who emigrated from China as a child, posed for a photo holding a legally-obtained gun off-campus, with the caption Don t tread on me. The caption also included an American flag emoji, a Chinese flag emoji, and a hashtag commonly used by Chinese citizens to avoid censorship of online discussion of the Tiananmen Square massacre.
Fordham wrote to Tong on June 8, when Dean of Students Keith Eldredge informed Tong he was under investigation by the university for the two photos. [The June 8 letter said, Specifically, it is reported that on June 3 and 4, and in the recent past, you made several posts on social media related to the current racial issues in the country and political issues in China, including one in which you were holding an automatic weapon. -EV] On [July 14], Fordham handed down its verdict: Tong was found guilty of violating university policies on bias and/or hate crimes and threats/intimidation. 
 When Tong immigrated to the United States from China at six years old, his family sought to ensure that he would be protected by the rights guaranteed by their new home, including the freedom of speech and the right to bear arms, wrote Program Officer Lindsie Rank, author of FIRE s letter to Fordham. Here, however, Fordham has acted more like the Chinese government than an American university, placing severe sanctions on a student solely because of off-campus political speech. 
Tong s probation bans him from physically visiting campus without prior approval, taking leadership roles in student organizations, and participating in athletics. He is also required to complete implicit bias training and write an apology letter.
 While what happened to me is a total disgrace, I hope to use my example as an opportunity for the millions of people out there that fear to freely speak, and to protest the serious case of speech censorship in college campuses, said Tong. As the country is facing a disastrous constitutional crisis, it is no time to stay silent, and we have been silent for way too long. It only takes the courage of the few to spark the patriotism of many. We will use this opportunity to let the world know that now is the time that we must speak loudly, fight for our rights, and let those who silence speech know they will face consequences. 
As a private institution, Fordham is not bound by the First Amendment. But it is bound by the explicit, repeated, and unequivocal promises of freedom of expression it makes to its students, including in its own mission statement: Fordham strives for excellence in research and teaching and guarantees the freedom of inquiry required by rigorous thinking and the quest for truth. 
Fordham holds FIRE s worst rating for free speech and makes frequent appearances on FIRE s Worst Colleges for Free Speech list. Additionally, a state court ruled just last year that Fordham violated its promises of freedom expression in censoring a pro-Palestinian student organization. Fordham is fighting that decision on appeal.
Pretty appalling behavior by Fordham, it seems to me. Yesterday, Tong sued Fordham for allegedly failing to substantially adhere[] to its own published rules and guidelines for disciplinary proceedings, a cause of action that New York courts recognize even against private universities, as the Palestinian student group case shows; you can read his legal arguments here.

184,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1251/Files (250).DOCX","telegraph.co.uk",2020-07-04,"1658 words","TV; Version:2","By Jane Mulkerrins",NA,"'This is the time to get angry': David Simon on The Plot Against America; The creator of The Wire on why the time was ripe to bring Philip Roth's vision of a fascist president to television",FALSE,"David Simon's father, Bernard, was seven years old when his own father took him on a rare trip across the Hudson River, from their home in New Jersey to witness Charles Lindbergh's ticker-tape parade through the streets of Manhattan. It was 1927, and the 25 year-old aviator had just become a national hero after making the first non-stop solo transatlantic flight, from New York to Paris, in his single-engine Spirit of St Louis.
""It was one of my father's earliest memories, sitting on his father's shoulders as Lindbergh came down Broadway,"" David Simon tells me. ""Lindbergh was a god to him."" By the time Bernard Simon (""this Jewish kid from Jersey City"") turned 18, Lindbergh was the darling of the German-American Bund, a pro-Nazi organisation established during the build-up to the Second World War. ""For my father to see him veer off into anti-Semitism was powerful and debilitating,"" Simon says.
We are talking on a humid summer's day in East Orange, New Jersey in 2019. The 60-year-old journalist-turned-television writer - who made his name with the acclaimed Baltimore crime drama The Wire and has gone on to make such punchy, politically-charged series as Treme, Generation Kill and The Deuce - is on the set of his latest project, an adaptation of Philip Roth's 2004 bestseller, The Plot Against America.
Published at the height of the George W Bush administration, the novel looked back six decades to imagine an alternative history in which Franklin D Roosevelt is defeated in the 1940 presidential election by Lindbergh, who, after moving from aviation into politics (something that Roosevelt reportedly considered a very real threat), runs on a platform of ""America First"", a motto that would come back to haunt Roth. Following Lindbergh's victory, he signs a treaty with Hitler's Germany, vowing to keep the US out of the Second World War, and unleashing a tide of fascism and anti-Semitism across America.
Despite the diversity of their setting, there is a common thread to Simon's critically acclaimed dramas. Whether they unspool on the crime-ridden streets of Baltimore, in post-Hurricane Katrina New Orleans, or in local government offices in 1980s New York, his stories commonly explore the capacity of the individual to survive within a brutal system that strips people of their humanity. The Plot Against America is no exception: a gnawing sense of dread builds throughout the early episodes of this nuanced six-part period piece as civil rights are steadily eroded, particularly for Jewish families.
Simon's adaptation makes some subtle but significant changes to the original novel. The Roth family at the heart of the drama have become the Levins, and their story is no longer told solely from the perspective of the youngest son, Philip (Azhy Robertson), but also from that of his brother, Sandy (Caleb Malis), his parents, Bess (Zoe Kazan) and Alvin (Morgan Spector), his aunt, Evelyn (Winona Ryder), and his cousin, Alvin (Anthony Boyle). While Roth's book ends with Lindbergh's plane disappearing and a re-elected Roosevelt leading America into war - and on to victory - the series reaches a more ambiguous, unsettling climax, since, says Simon, against the current political backdrop, ""there was something more interesting to be said"".
How times change. When he was first approached to adapt The Plot Against America in 2013, Simon now admits he was baffled. ""I said, why would I do that? We've just elected an African-American president for the second time. Our political future is going the opposite way to this retrograde populism. I told them: 'I loved the book when I read it - it was a lovely little artefact of imagined alternative history, but it's not the history we have now. Thanks, but I just don't see it.'""
Four years later, as Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States, while his supporters chanted ""America First"", Roth's novel looked newly, disturbingly relevant. Simon - whose dramas betray an uncommon gift for capturing both the overwhelming currents acting on any given community and the frailty of the human lives swept along on them - could no longer resist.
While working on the screenplay, he met Roth (who died in 2018) just once. The novelist warned Simon that, in seeking contemporary echoes for the story, ""to be aware that the dynamic of Trump doesn't exactly line up"", he recalls. ""He said: 'Lindbergh was a hero, a fundamentally brave man, who had done something extraordinary, and was beloved by America and to some extent, the world. While Trump', he commented, 'is the opposite of that'.""
Nevertheless, Simon says that while Roth ""certainly didn't imagine Donald Trump"" he did ""imagine a demagogue seizing power and creating an isolationist and xenophobic fear of the other"". No leap of imagination is required to detect signs of xenophobia at the heart of the current US administration. It is, after all, overseen by a leader who publicly refers to coronavirus as ""kung flu"" and during whose presidency hate crime rates in America have soared. Simon sees this as the re-emergence of an ugly aspect of the American outlook that has always been latent.
""As a nation of immigrants we've been savaging whatever the current wave of immigration is for as long as the country's been alive,"" he says. ""It's what we do. We normally believe that whoever is coming to our shores and attempting to become Americans will not be sufficiently American enough; that their capacities to assimilate will be inferior to our own, that they will not become the same Americans we are, that they will not be the kind of Americans we want.
""We've been saying this since it was the Irish and the Germans and we've been saying it for the Jews and the Italians and through African-Americans and then the migration north. We've been saying it now with the Latinos and now with Muslims, and we keep saying it and it's always a lie.""
For all that The Plot Against America grapples with big ideas, it is also Simon's most personal series to date. Displayed on set, there are old photographs of his own parents - who, like the Levins, were the children of Jewish immigrants from Russia, Hungary and Poland. Some of his father's stock phrases have even made their way into the script. ""My Dad passed away several years ago, and when I was writing Herman Levin, I'd find myself sticking Bernie Simon in,"" he says, fondly. ""I don't think a dinner went by when my Dad would taste my mother's soup and wouldn't say: 'You know how much you'd pay for this soup if you were at Katz's Deli? A dollar a spoonful.' So Herman says that now. I pulled my family through the keyhole in this.""
Simon grew up in what he describes as a ""secular family, with some basic Jewish ritual"", in Washington DC, where his father was public relations director for the Jewish service organisation B'nai B'rith. While studying journalism at the University of Maryland, he edited the college newspaper and landed his first scoop - a MeToo-style scandal involving the basketball coach. ""He should have been fired, but instead, they did a bullshit investigation for six months, slapped him on the wrist and gave him a new contract for more money,"" he recalls, still sounding aggrieved. ""At that exact moment, I knew what my job was - to get the story right. What they do after it, I cannot control.""
That piece landed him his first job, on the Baltimore Sun, where he spent 13 years as a police reporter. In 1988, he took a leave of absence to write a book about the city's homicide unit. The book became the basis for the award-winning TV series Homicide: Life on the Streets, which launched Simon's screenwriting career, and supplied many of the incidents and unforgettable characters he would draw on for The Wire.
Almost a year after our first meeting, in late May 2020, I spoke to Simon again, this time by phone from his home in Baltimore, where he lives with his wife, the novelist Laura Lippman, and their 10 year-old daughter, Georgia. At that point, The Plot Against America was already showing in the United States, the coronavirus pandemic had claimed 115,000 American lives (a figure that has, at time of writing, reached 128,000) and triggered the highest unemployment rate since the Great Depression, and the next presidential election was less than six months away.
""I'm very worried,"" Simon tells me. ""We're coming up to what may be the most important election of my life and it feels like we're about to pivot. Either we're about to say no to something and start walking it back, or we're about to go in deeper into something very ugly."" While garrulous and outspoken, Simon is also careful and precise; a far remove from his irascible Twitter persona, which he says he sees as a sort of ""performance art"". But, he makes no bones about it, he is angry. ""If you write politically, and you're living in this moment, and you're not angry, then there's something wrong with you,"" he says. ""This is the time to get angry; there's not going to be a tomorrow if enough people don't get angry.""
While he's aware that, as a maker of television drama, he has limited influence, he hopes The Plot Against America will at least provoke ""a conversation about the American capacity for totalitarianism"", he says. ""But we were just really proud to get it made and on screen the election year. When they ask us what we were doing when the country turned in such an ugly way towards fascism, what we were writing about, we can look at ourselves in the mirror.
""I don't think democracy will ever get to a point where we go, oh, we've perfected it,"" he adds. ""Every day, you have to get up and kill snakes - and we've got to a point where we're not killing snakes fast enough."" Even down the line I can hear the note of pessimism in his voice. ""The snakes are getting to be very good at what they do,"" he says. ""And it's scary.""

(Spencer Platt / Getty Images) No area in the world, including in Israel, is more diversely Jewish than Brooklyn's Ocean Parkway. Along its roughly five-mile course from Prospect Park to Coney Island live Jewish communities with roots in the Caucasus, North Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, and Eastern Europe. 
People speak English, Yiddish, and Hebrew—but also half a dozen forms of Arabic (both Jewish and non-Jewish varieties), Russian, Persian, Azeri, and Uzbek. Some speak smaller, endangered Jewish languages such as Juhuri, Bukhori, Ladino, and Judeo-Shirazi. Many are refugees, or the children or grandchildren of refugees—survivors of persecution, displacement, and in some cases genocide. Compared to most American Jews, they are much more religiously and communally engaged, following many different traditions and leaders. Usually this remarkable microcosm of the vanishing global Jewish diaspora, compressed into a handful of neighborhoods with an equally diverse array of non-Jews, gets on more or less like any other part of New York City—by some miraculous formula perhaps best left unquestioned. But as of last week, the 'Ocean Parkway cluster,' a designated Covid-19 red zone along with two other Orthodox clusters in Queens, is in lockdown. City-wide, cases have doubled from where they were a month ago, and positivity rates in the red zones are pushing 5 percent. After the nightmare of March and April, the city's phased reopening looks increasingly in peril. Fears of a second wave, worsening in winter, are growing. For Governor Andrew Cuomo, Mayor Bill de Blasio, and many New Yorkers, a targeted lockdown—more or less a return to the spring for the red zones and lesser reversals for the adjacent orange and yellow zones—seems like common sense. Although it's not clear whether you can shut down individual neighborhoods when residents can still walk or ride to a nearby area where everything is business as usual. When the virus struck in the spring, wealthy New Yorkers fled and working-class New Yorkers kept things running and disproportionately fell ill and died. The impact on heavily minority outer-borough neighborhoods was a tragedy, connected to structural inequalities around health, housing, language, and other factors. Likewise epidemiologically vulnerable, Orthodox neighborhoods—overcrowded, mixed-income, and at times with limited or delayed access to good information in the relevant languages—suffered grievously and adjusted heroically. Many subsequently believed that herd immunity had been achieved. Now 'pandemic fatigue' is to varying degrees everywhere, and Orthodox Jews—from many different backgrounds, though Hasidim are always the most visible—are the local face of a global problem. For a still-traumatized city, there is no sympathizing with packed mass gatherings, secret yeshivas, masks over chins (if on at all), and most recently the antics of a scary self-promoter inciting violence[1]. Beyond the city, the pattern is similar in other, linked Orthodox communities in Rockland, Orange, Nassau, and Ocean counties. (No clear evidence of a spike, however, in more liberal or 'centrist' Orthodox parts of the city like Washington Heights and Riverdale.) In recent months, Israel too has been struggling with one of the world's worst and most contentious outbreaks, centered on Haredi areas like Bnei Brak. The problem is not religious, but political. Large weddings and religious gatherings may well be playing a role in transmission, especially around the High Holidays, which many liberal and secular Jews observed virtually or very cautiously. Orthodox lifeways are intensely face-to-face and driven by community priorities, often with scant respect for 'outside' political or scientific authorities. But if Orthodox Brooklyn is now a red zone, with wavering community commitment to stopping the spread and a vocal minority of anti-maskers, the reason is that it is a de facto red state in the making. For New Yorkers and for American Jews, there are serious long-term implications to an Orthodox red state of half a million people and counting in the tristate area. There are all sorts of ways that an Orthodox red state can steer politics in the region. Consider how the Christian right calls the shot in red states, and is now pushing for a champion on the Supreme Court, and then consider how 'the evangelicalization of Orthodoxy'[2] is installing a similar, albeit smaller, force in the middle of the nation's largest metro area. The multigenerational demographic, material, and affective ties that bind most secular American Jews to liberalism were only ever marginally operative for the post-World War II arrivals who dominate Orthodox Brooklyn and its satellite communities. But over the last few decades, places like Midwood and Borough Park have turned decisively into right-wing strongholds, with the process only accelerating under Donald Trump. Some of it is about Israel, but the Republican fetish for a hypermilitarized ethno-state heralding the apocalypse doesn't explain why even many anti-Zionist Hasidim vote Republican. Some of it is social conservatism, though the Christian right operates from much deeper political and theological roots. For post-Soviet Jews, there's residual anti-communism; for Syrian Jews, there's talking tough on Islamic militants; for business types, there's tax cuts; for others, it's the appeal of histrionics and chauvinism full-stop. In the New York context, a red-state identity can be situational, as much a declaration of difference as a Borsalino and a pair of payos. Like other white ethnic New Yorkers, many Orthodox New Yorkers are emphatically defining themselves against what they see as the dual hegemony of both white (especially secular Jewish) liberals and the surrounding minority communities. Orthodox communities—far from being the backward relics that many outsiders like to imagine—have engineered an extraordinary survival, expansion, and transformation since the Holocaust. Many Orthodox understand their communities, understandably, as the cutting edge of Jewish life, and liberal and secular Jews as the ones rendering themselves obsolete through assimilation, intermarriage, low birthrate, and disengagement. At a minimum, the successful regeneration of the Orthodox world means neighborhoods bursting at the seams, new zones of settlement, more contact with and scrutiny from outsiders, changing community dynamics, and deepening challenges in public health and other realms. Just to take public health: When informed, motivated, and united, Orthodox New Yorkers have had impressive achievements, from the response to Tay-Sachs to the Covid-19 plasma drives just a few months ago. Though unworkable given the highly contagious nature of Covid-19, the Orthodox practice of bikur holim, or visiting the sick, is a grassroots support system like few others. The Hatzolah ambulances, working double time this year, are a fascinating example of a highly decentralized Orthodox network that both serves specific religious needs, in a spirit of community self-reliance, and interfaces with the systems of the wider society. To confront the rising caseload and keep New York safe, both city and state have to rebuild trust, with aid and sympathy for the affected communities in all their Jewish (and non-Jewish) diversity. Global and national failures have brought us here, to the point of shutting down individual zip codes, and the city has largely failed, despite some strides and good intentions, to communicate effectively across all of its complex ethnolinguistic landscapes. No community is going to like a targeted lockdown, and a pandemic is a dangerous time to generalize about groups of people, particularly in the context of rising anti-Semitism. (Last year, more than half of the city's reported hate crimes were anti-Semitic.) The red zone may be Ocean Parkway today, but it was Corona in Queens back in April, Starrett City in Brooklyn after that, and it could be anywhere next month. City and state need to find and support the communities' more liberal and moderate forces, quietly if necessary. For decades, in a distant reflection of the medieval shtadln system, city politicians have counted on being able to call up a handful of well-known mediators presumed to be close to the religious leaders. In return for their support, and getting things done, Orthodox communities got a pass on everything from the lack of secular studies at many yeshivas to metzitzah b'peh[3]. In the current crisis, DeBlasio and Cuomo appear to be taking a harder line, and many New Yorkers will agree with them. But enforcing compliance will be a nightmare: far better to find points of leverage like state funding[4] and convince Orthodox communities, one by one if necessary, before the wails of ambulance sirens do the convincing. To do so, the city will have to confront not just the traditional mediators, who still matter, but a whole host of freelance operators and opportunists. In particular, the controversial and explosive impact of the Internet is giving a platform to all sorts of new voices, both dangerous and promising, as well as enabling a small but steady stream of defectors[5]. One liaison in the city's Department of Health is good, but how about a minyan[6]'s worth of liaisons? Ideally, there should be concerted, separate efforts with the many different Hasidic courts and with the Syrian, Bukharian, Juhuro, Litvish, Russian communities, to name only some of the most numerous. From Der Yid to the Bukharian Times to the WhatsApp groups[7] and the Yiddish hotlines, there is a vast world of local Orthodox media to reach. Modern Orthodox leaders should help bridge the gap. Even secular and liberal Jewish organizations, however far removed, have a role to play, after years of protecting, funding and at the same time privately deprecating the Orthodox world. From supporting the system ofkashrut(kosher) certification dominated by groups like the Orthodox Unionto letting Chabad take over communities and campuses, we are enabling the red state in our own backyard.

On Sept. 25, the RCMP arrested Shehroze Chaudhry , a Muslim man, for allegedly fabricating his affiliation with the Islamic State group (ISIS). Chaudhry — popularly referred to by his supposed nom de guerre, Abu Huzayfah — had been the subject of numerous news stories since 2017.
Most notably, in 2018, Chaudhry was the focus of Rukmini Callimachi's award-winning New York Times podcast, Caliphate . In it Chaudhry provided graphic details of his role within ISIS, the veracity of which is now being questioned. Chaudhry had previously been interrogated about his involvement with ISIS by Canadian national security agencies but was not charged.
Nevertheless, Callimachi's misleading reporting at the Times prompted debates in Parliament , raising fears about an 'ISIS terrorist' and 'despicable animal … freely walking the streets of Toronto.'
CBC News interviewed Rukmini Callimachi in 2018 about Shehroze Chaudhry's changing story. The ensuing media attention fed into panic about the risk posed by returning 'foreign fighters,' individuals — mainly Muslim women and men — who travelled to Iraq and Syria to support ISIS.
In response to the Times podcast, the Canadian government reversed plans to repatriate Canadian foreign fighters and their families detained in Kurdish-controlled Syrian prison camps.
Callimachi's gaffe is a symptomChaudhry's case has raised questions about the abruptness of his arrest , the merit of a terrorism hoax charge , the substantial role of the media in the War on Terror and Canada's obligations to its citizens, including 26 children, held in Syrian prison camps .
But the reporting and policy reaction to Chaudhry's alleged falsehoods reveals a sociopolitical climate where a different standard is applied to the threat posed by Muslims. Chaudhry's case is not an outlier, but rather a symptom of the system. Callimachi's faux pas is then just another story of Islamophobia.
Edward Said introduced the concept of Orientalism to capture how western societies imagine and produce reductive and racist representations of Muslims and Arabs. Our research on national security policies in Canada and the United Kingdom suggests that Islamophobia informs and legitimizes an Orientalist approach in the reporting of Muslim terrorism suspects and produces racialized national security policies.

Islamophobia is more than hateChaudhry's case reveals how Islamophobia operates beyond individualized instances of discrimination against Muslims. The view that Islamophobia is merely an 'irrational fear of Muslims,' as a 2018 report by the House of Commons suggests , is simplistic and outdated.
According to legal scholars Reem Bahdi and Azeezah Kanji , Islamophobia 'is historically rooted in Orientalism, draws on and perpetuates stereotypes about a Muslim propensity for violence, … is state-driven and persists through a dialectical process of private and state action.'
In our research, we outline how Muslims are racialized through the War on Terror: ' appearance as well as expressions attributed to Muslim bodies and Islam are framed within a social order which sees these as backward, foreign and threatening .'
Rather than abstract disdain for Islam or Muslims, Islamophobia manifests as ' concrete social action ' by the national security industry, populist politicians, journalists, experts, think tanks and others who benefit from portraying Muslims as ' inherently violent … alien and inassimilable .'
In this, any political movement connected to — or perceived as connected to — Islam is not only viewed as antithetical to democracy, but as a threat to democracy's very existence. This Islamophobia was especially evident in coverage by Callimachi, whose success skyrocketed after the Caliphate podcast.
Muslims and riskIslamophobia is useful to understand how the dangerousness and riskiness of Muslims is constructed.
First, Muslim beliefs and actions are thought to present the potential of regressiveness and violence. This establishes the basis of ' good Muslim, bad Muslim ': Muslims are considered 'good' if they integrate and continuously perform their role as model citizens. But their potential of becoming a 'bad' Muslim — who could radicalize toward terrorism — is never fully eradicated.
Through this lens, despite interrogations by Canadian authorities and journalists, Chaudhry was presented as an ISIS terrorist before ever being charged.
Second, Islamophobia represents Muslims as ' dangerous internal foreigners ,' whose rights can be overlooked in the name of national security. This explains why Canadian Muslims in Syrian prisons are not even considered worthy of repatriation to stand trial.
Finally, the Orientalist framing of the bad Muslim is the basis of counterterrorism practice — and perpetuated by academic scholarship — reinforcing the status of Muslims as a ' suspect community .'
The media in the War on TerrorToday, national governments, media conglomerates and security industries profit from the potential of catastrophe, and so perpetuate a present that is always ' at-risk .'
News coverage plays a significant role in normalizing constant risk; counterterrorism and counter-extremism institutions rely on this to establish their legitimacy among the public.
The media's role in advancing Islamophobia cannot be understated. Media narratives that portray Muslims in dehumanizing and violent terms establish public consensus about the danger of Muslims.
Incidences of terrorism by Muslim perpetrators receive more media attention and their motivations are linked to their ethnic and religious background . This feeds into a ' moral panic ' around Muslims, where media sensationalism and governments stigmatize Muslims as deviant and a threat to social and moral order .
Chaudhry's case is not about an ignorant or irresponsible reporter telling a poorly fact-checked story . It is about the complicity of media and governments in vilifying Muslims to the point that it is reasonable to paint Muslims as terrorists before they ever stand trial.
Chaudhry's alleged hoax — from its rise to an award-winning New York Times story to affecting Canadian national security policy — reveals a lot about Islamophobia today. This is the same Islamophobia that dehumanizes Canadian Muslims and casts them as potentially dangerous.

This gruesome 8-minute public act of murder was caught on video, now seen thousands of times worldwide.
Just seven years ago, Eric Garner, a 44-year-old unarmed African American man, uttered the same words before he was murdered in New York City by a white police officer in a deadly chokehold, also caught on bystander video.
""I can't breathe"" has become a rallying cry for African Americans, who have been slowly suffocating under the chokehold of America's systemic racism around their necks.
America is one of the wealthiest and most powerful countries in the world. Its cultural contributions - many made by African Americans - penetrate the lives of people worldwide in the form of Hollywood films, pop music, social media, and sports.
For decades, the image of American exceptionalism has led refugees and immigrants to flock in millions to the Shining City on a Hill in hopes of achieving the American Dream. Millions more visit its iconic tourist locations.
But America has continued to struggle and falter, its success held back by the sparring realities of whites' and Blacks' separate and unequal existences. Racism is America's birth defect. The racial caste system has been modernized, but never really dismantled.
American has the largest prison population of any industrialized country, with more than six million citizens confined or under correctional monitoring. The vast majority are African Americans. America has the highest number of COVID-19 infections and deaths, with African Americans dying at the highest rate.
America is again number one among industrialized peers in infant mortality, adult obesity, murder, maternal mortality, and food insecurity. African Americans bear the weight of these burdens on their necks, their suffocation recorded in full sight.
Such systemic disparities have led scholars and social activists to point to the existence of ""two Americas."" Black families growing up in the shadows of the Stars and Stripes, in communities untouched by America's prosperity.
For more than 200 years, America has waged a David-and-Goliath war against its African American ""citizens,"" whose lives matter only as long as they do not threaten white safety and privilege. African American poverty and second-class citizenship have been driven by structural and systemic racism established by chattel slavery, sustained through Jim Crow and modernized as the prison industrial complex, de facto school segregation, the racialized American child welfare system, and ongoing voter suppression.
All these factors contribute to the racialization of American poverty. The average African American family today would need 228 years to achieve wealth parity with white households.
This systemic racism grinds on African Americans' necks day by day, even without the aid of an officer's knee. Nevertheless, when the police are called, we see maddening incidents - bird watching, sitting at Starbucks, studying at Yale, babysitting, renting an Airbnb, shopping, and driving while Black. All these incidents unduly threaten the safety and lives of African Americans.
The rallying cry of the Black Lives Matter movement is a call for recognition of the full humanity and citizenship of African Americans. Between 2005 and April 2017, 80 officers had been arrested on murder or manslaughter charges for on-duty shootings. During that 12-year span, 35 per cent were convicted, while the rest were pending or not convicted.
The historical culture of police impunity in relation to the murders of African American people and the sluggish response to the murder of George Floyd despite harrowing videotape evidence has sparked marches and riots in Minneapolis, across the United States, and around the world even in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The fraying of American exceptionalism takes place against the background of Make America Great Again, the rise of hate crimes, the erosion of civil rights, and the ongoing murder of unarmed African Americans without police accountability, putting America's moral standing into deep scrutiny.
It is time for police reform and sensible dialogue between community activists, law enforcement officials, and state and federal leaders.
I can't breathe.

1. Coronavirus
Some alarming Covid-19 trends are emerging across several US states, and officials are desperately pleading with people to stay home, wear masks and keep their distance. California, Florida and Arizona are reporting thousands of new cases each day. And in Texas, health authorities have said new cases and hospitalizations are rising at their fastest rate yet. These are among 26 states -- a number also on the rise -- seeing new cases increase compared with the prior week. Despite warnings that Black Lives Matter protests across the country could lead to a jump in cases, new research suggests that's not happening. Instead, the latest surges stem from the number of places in the country that reopened too soon and too quickly. It's a stark contrast with other parts of the world. The situation in the US is so bad that European Union nations are discussing a recommendation to block American travelers.
2. Justice Department
Two Justice Department prosecutors will testify before the House Judiciary Committee today, accusing Attorney General William Barr and senior department officials of politicizing investigations. Aaron Zelinsky, a prosecutor on former special counsel Robert Mueller's team, plans to testify that the sentencing recommendation for Trump's longtime friend and adviser Roger Stone was watered down due to political pressure from the ""highest levels"" of DOJ, according to his prepared remarks. John Elias, a career prosecutor in the Antitrust Division, accused Barr of ordering investigations into 10 mergers of cannabis companies because he did not like the industry, according to a copy of his testimony. Their criticism comes just days after Barr's decision to fire Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, which has investigated Trump and his associates.
3. NASCAR
Turns out the noose found Sunday in driver Bubba Wallace's garage at Talladega Superspeedway had been there as long ago as October. That's according to the FBI, which said yesterday that Wallace was not the victim of a hate crime. NASCAR, mentioning the FBI report, described the item as a ""garage door pull rope fashioned like a noose."" Wallace, the only Black driver in NASCAR's top circuit, said he's upset some in the public are now questioning his integrity. ""Whether tied in 2019 or whatever, it was a noose,"" he said. ""So, it wasn't directed at me but somebody tied a noose. That's what I'm saying.""
4. Mexico
A 7.4-magnitude earthquake hit Mexico's southern Oaxaca region yesterday, killing at least five people. The earthquake stuck around 10:30 a.m. local time, with an epicenter 6.8 miles southwest of Santa MarÃ­a ZapotitlÃ¡n, near El Coyul. It collapsed buildings and prompted evacuations, even damaging hospitals that had been dealing with coronavirus patients. The quake could be felt as far as Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Tremors were also felt in the capital Mexico City, more than 200 miles away. The US Geological Survey said the damage in Oaxaca state is considered light to moderate -- relatively good news considering that Mexico is one of the world's most seismically active regions and has a long history of devastating earthquakes.
5. Canada
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is calling China's decision to charge two of his country's citizens with espionage clearly political. Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor were officially charged this week with spying and handling state secrets. The two men have been detained in China since 2018, in the weeks following the arrest in Vancouver of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of the Chinese technology company Huawei, on charges filed in the US. Trudeau is now under pressure to do something about the case of the ""two Michaels,"" possibly including facilitating a prisoner swap. The Prime Minister said he isn't considering a trade of the two men for the detained Huawei exec and has previously said intervening in the case would undermine the independence of the country's justice system.

193,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1251/Files (250).DOCX","Newstex Blogs",2020-07-14,"3434 words",NA,"Hisham Aidi",NA,"The new 'invisible enemy'",FALSE,"Jul 14, 2020( Africa is a Country: http://africasacountry.com Delivered by Newstex) In hindsight, June 16, 2015 was a turning point, a date critical to understanding today's political tumult. That was the day Donald Trump announced his candidacy for president, theatrically descending the escalator at Trump Tower, then giving a rambling speech that linked illegal immigration, terrorism, and the offshoring of American jobs. It was the moment when he introduced the phrase 'Make America Great Again' and vowed to build a 'great, great wall on our southern border.' The media would focus on his derogatory remarks about Mexicans 'bringing drugs, bringing crime.' 
Trump's candidacy would cause an immediate spike in hate crimes and send political groups scrambling to join forces with—or distance themselves from—whichever group he targeted next. His following surged as he rode the wave of white nationalist backlash to immigration, failed wars and a Black incumbent. Among the more intriguing developments in the wake of Trump's candidacy was the rise in anti-Muslim speech from Hispanic celebrities and public figures. Conservative Hispanic politicians had long argued that immigration reform was stalling because of Muslim terrorists slipping through the southern border. For example, New Mexico Governor Susan Martinez had called for more security at the US-Mexico border in 2013, after Border Patrol agents found candy wrappers with Arabic writing. But Trump's brutal joining of the question of Hispanic migration with terrorism, of Islamophobia and Hispanophobia (long linked in French and English colonial thought, but not in the American imaginary) would unleash a torrent of anti-Muslim speech on Spanish talk radio and social media. Miss Puerto Rico Destiny Vlez tweeted that Muslims 'terrorize innocent Americans,' adding that, 'Mexicans, Arabs, Jews and anything in between aren't the same thing.' In August 2015, Ramon Escobar, a youngish Hispanic American diplomat who had handled State Department engagement with the Muslim world, ranted to a handful of journalists about his tour in Saudi Arabia, saying that in the Gulf's failed societies 'it's always the will of Allah' and expressed outrage that Latinos were being associated with terrorism.As the campaign unfolded, more prominent Hispanic politicians sounded off: Texas Senator Ted Cruz called for law enforcement to patrol Muslim neighborhoods while Florida Senator Marco Rubio denigrated President Barack Obama for visiting a mosque in Baltimore. This rhetoric was aimed at distancing Latinos from Muslims, to signal that Latinos were not a national security issue. Trump's candidacy and rise to office ultimately proved as politically cataclysmic as the events of September 11, 2001, generating unexpected animosities, alliances, and bizarre new discourses. Thirty percent of Latinos ended up voting for Trump, while Hindu nationalists rallied behind his stances on terrorism and immigration. But Trump's ascent also precipitated much solidarity on the left, as groups mobilized against the Muslim ban and to defend DACA[1]. Resistance to Trump also coalesced to produce wins for progressive candidates nationwide, including four women of color (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib) elected to Congress in 2018 who became known as The Squad. These victories occurred alongside a surge of hate crimes against Jews, Muslims, and Hispanics, with a terrible mass shooting of Hispanics at a Walmart in Texas in November 2019. As groups integrate into the American political process, they often reflect the country's deep rifts, frequently manifesting in a split between those wanting to express solidarity or opposition to the Muslim other. Unsurprisingly, the Trump years have been characterized by a rise in Hispanic Islamophobia, including the tragic high-profile murders of Muslims by young Hispanics, most prominently of Nadra Hassanen in Washington, DC and Imam Maulana Akonjee and Thara Uddin at a mosque in Ozone Park, Queens. In early 2005, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the David C. Driskell Center for the Study of the African Diaspora at the University of Maryland, trying to understand a social movement that was spreading rapidly across US campuses and cities, and eventually to France and Britain. The Save Darfur movement[2] took off in early 2004—in circumstances not unlike the present moment—as a buffoonish, flailing Republican president ran for a second term against a lackluster Democratic candidate in a war on terror context. I subsequently published an essay in Middle East Report titled 'Slavery, Genocide and the Politics of Outrage: Understanding the New Racial Olympics[3]' that sought to explain why of all the civil wars in Africa and humanitarian crises in the world, it was the mass violence in western Sudan that had gripped the American imagination. The answer, I argued, lay in the post-September 11 domestic political scene: Unlike other hot spots across Africa, the Darfur tragedy reverberates deeply in the US because it is represented as a racial conflict between Arabs and indigenous Africans, because Sudan is where the 'moral geographies' of black, Jewish and Christian nationalists overlap and because the Darfur crisis offers a unique opportunity to unite against the new post-Cold War enemy. The Save Darfur movement started on college campuses to counter pro-Palestinian agitation. When Students for Justice in Palestine would bring Israeli refuseniks to speak, the American Anti-Slavery Group founded by Charles Jacobs—who would also launch Save Darfur—would respond by bringing Sudanese 'lost boys' to speak about Arab racism. Jacobs was also the founder of The David Project, which monitored Middle East Studies departments for alleged anti-Israel prejudice and funded the filmColumbia UnBecoming, which claims to document incidents of bias in that university's Department of Middle East and Asian Languages and Cultures. To show how these three American nationalisms—evangelical, Jewish and Black—overlapped in Sudan, I highlighted three frontiers: the colonial and Huntingtonian so-called faultline between Africa and the Arab world that ran through Sudan; the urban periphery where competing conceptions of the Middle East co-existed uneasily and where Latino immigration was leading to fears of ethnic succession; and finally the US-Mexico border where Hispanic migration had led to Minuteman vigilantism and to Samuel Huntington's warning of a 'demographic Reconquista' and a backlash from whites fearing 'replacement.' The current protest movement against police brutality—unfolding during a horrific pandemic crisis that has exposed and deepened societal fissures—clearly differs from the Save Darfur movement. For starters, the current protest is against American state violence, specifically the recurring spectacle of police cruelty against black men. Black Lives Matter is not calling for military intervention, and in fact has an anti-colonial facet. Save Darfur activists, on the other hand, would often chant 'Out of Iraq, Into Sudan.' Since the COVID-19 crisis began in February, the global war on terror seems to have faded away; the war on the new 'invisible enemy'—and the Trump administration's hapless response—have dominated headlines. The absence of a Muslim bogeyman seems to have created space for new alliances and coalitions, as the establishment foreign policy hawks have receded from view. Another difference is that while, in 2005, some older Afrocentrists (like the late comedian Dick Gregory) supported Save Darfur, the majority of black (and minority) leaders steered clear of the movement. Save Darfur ended up being a largely white movement led by a Jewish-Christian coalition. Jewish organizations, which agitated on campuses in the mid-2000s, have been relatively silent in recent years, perhaps because their policy objectives have been achieved. The Department of Education has moved to sanction and deny Title VI funding to a number of Middle East Studies programs deemed biased, the US embassy has been relocated to Jerusalem and Israel is moving to annex additional Palestinian territories. The current movement, under the aegis of Black Lives Matter, is multi-ethnic and multi-racial, and while it has inspired protests globally, it is focused domestically on police violence and reparations. If Trumpism was a response to the humiliation of failed wars in Afghanistan and Iraq (it is no coincidence that the Minuteman Project began patrolling the southern border days after the Abu Ghraib story broke) then Black Lives Matter is protesting the militarization of urban policing resulting from those same unending wars. The decades of counterinsurgency abroad have boomeranged back home with the expansion of mass surveillance under Obama and the continuation of the Pentagon's 1033 program that has transferred $7.4 billion of surplus military equipment[4] (such as armored vehicles and rifles) to law enforcement departments nationwide. In February 2015,The Guardian broke a story about a 'black site' operated by domestic law enforcement in Chicago, echoing the secret detention facilities used by US defense and intelligence agencies to interrogate and torture prisoners overseas. The militarization of policing may have been newsworthy in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014 after the death of Michael Brown at the hands of the police, but it barely registered in 2012 when then-Mayor Pete Buttigieg shared a New York Timesarticle titled 'With Green Beret Tactics, Combating Gang Warfare[5]' with the comment: 'Interesting use of counter-insurgency tactics to address gang violence.' Nor was much made of Minnesota Governor Tom Waltz's recent claim that the unrest made American cities look like Baghdad or Mogadishu. Now, 15 years after Save Darfur, American power and prestige are vastly diminished. In 2005, the neo-cons calling for intervention in Sudan were in part vexed by China's access to Sudan's oil, as well as Beijing's refusal to isolate the regime of former Sudanese President Omar Al-Bashir. (Stephen Spielberg famously withdrew as adviser to the Beijing Olympics because of China's Darfur policy.) Today as Chinese-American relations are in free-fall, China has surpassed the United States as Africa's biggest trade partner and Trump allegedly appealed to Chinese President Xi Jinping for help in the upcoming election. But the parallels and continuities between Save Darfur and the current movement are striking—the three frontiers are still politically relevant. At his inaugural speech, Trump warned that 'places like Afghanistan are safer than our inner cities.' The president is still intrigued by comparisons of Islam's 'bloody borders' with the southern US border and continues to link the two, as when he threatened to designate Mexican drug cartels terrorist organizations, or when he placed Venezuela on the updated Muslim ban list because the Maduro government was allegedly granting Venezuelan passports to Hezbollah militants[6]. Prima facie, the president's fascination with the inner city may appear less comprehensible than his obsession with the southern border; but these two frontiers are critical to understanding his persona. Trump's America First worldview, we are told, is rooted in Jacksonian nationalism, which harks back to Andrew Jackson, the notorious slave-owning and slave-selling president and architect of the Indian Removal Act, whose portrait currently hangs in the Oval Office. In his well-regardedSpecial Providence: American Foreign Policy and How It Changed the World(2002), Walter Russell Mead describes the Jacksonian tradition as the honor-based, Scotch-Irish ethno-nationalism of the American frontier, a folk community hostile to elites, immigration and international law, which believes the US should deploy ruthless military power whenever threatened. In an aside, Mead argues that despite their white supremacist roots, Jacksonian values had a major influence on African American culture in the south and also in the gang culture of inner cities which have re-created 'the atmosphere and practices of American frontier life.' Few would think of Trump as a blend of hip hop and Jacksonian swag, but a case could be made. Trump was an icon in hip hop culture for decades, a symbol of ostentatious wealth, his name mentioned in some 300 rap lyrics. As Charles Blow ofTheNew York Times wrote[7], the Queens-born real estate magnate rose alongside the genre in 1970s New York watching 'the moguls it made, the bravado it brandished. He liked it, envied it, aped it.' And for all his disdain for poor minorities, soon learned 'how to assert white privilege and emulate black power.' In fact, Trump weaponized New York city's hip hop culture, appropriating—in Blow's words—the 'coarser side' of Black culture to build a blustering populist brand that propelled him to the country's highest political office. It is ironic that as gangsta rap declined in the mid-2000s (making way for a gentler, more up-lifting Kendrik-Drake sound), its echoes can still be seen in the Oval Office and among populist strongmen elsewhere. Consider Brazilian leader Jair Bolsonaro, who has a coterie of MAGA-hat-wearing rappers who compose lyrics in support of his reactionary platform. Still, it is worth emphasizing that in the US (and Brazil) the hip hop community turned overwhelmingly against Trump once he was in the White House. As during the Darfur crisis, the Muslim grocer in the inner city is still a source of contention. In November 2005, liquor stores in Oakland owned by Muslim immigrants were vandalized (one store burnt down, and an employee kidnapped.) In 2015, following the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson outside a store owned by an Indian immigrant, a boycott was organized of immigrant-owned stores[8]. Anger at the figure of the Muslim grocer has surfaced again since the death of George Floyd, when it emerged that the call to the police was made by an employee of a Palestinian-owned grocery, prompting more calls for boycotts as well as attacks against Middle Eastern and South Asian-owned businesses in a range of cities. The debate continues among African Americans on the merits of solidarity with Arab/Muslim organizations. In 2005, Arab and Muslim activists were focused on lobbying the US Census Bureau to add a new MENA (Middle Eastern and North Africa) minority status category that would allow Americans from the region to claim non-white identity, and thus qualify for various civil rights protections (including special status as potential hate crime victims) as well as benefit from affirmative action policies. An energized Black-Palestinian left emerged in 2014 speaking of a Gaza-Ferguson nexus, but a self-described school of Afropessimism continues to be wary of forming solidarities, especially with the Arab world where these critics say 'anti-blackness' is 'foundational.' Given that the Trump White House has flatly opposed the census request, these young anti-racism activists from Arab and Muslim backgrounds have turned their energy to countering police violence and surveillance as well as addressing the image of the anti-black Muslim shop-owner. Multiple initiatives[9] have been launched by Middle Eastern and North African Americans—scholars and activists—most recently 'Arabs For Black Lives' that attempt to mediate between Muslim grocers and their patrons by providing training in cultural difference, de-escalation, and support for these merchants to 'go green' and carry produce in lieu of liquor and junk food. The generation that was in high school during the Darfur crisis has now come of age. But there remains a political gulf between this younger generation of woke Muslim activists, who are eager for acceptance into BLM and similar coalitions, and who are harshly critical of the much-maligned grocer—sometimes speaking of them as settlers and exploitative colonists—and the older generation (among them the shop-owners) who do not understand the difference between a Becky and a Karen, and do not see why they should be criticized for selling the alcohol and tobacco products their customers demand. Ironically, some of this local opposition leads Muslim grocers to relocate to Hispanic neighborhoods, where immigrant merchants selling such products have been less likely to draw criticism. Despite the Islamophobic rhetoric from political hopefuls, a recent poll shows that among whites, Blacks and Hispanics, Hispanic Americans score the lowest on the Islamophobia Index[10], with Hispanic Americans five times more likely to hold favorable opinions of Muslims than negative ones (51 percent versus 10 percent). In my 2005 essay, I concluded by observing that the topic of racism in North Africa and the Middle East has long been dominated by external interests and actors and marked by official suppression of all discussions of the region's legacies of slavery and racism. But even in the mid-2000s, one could see the emergence of an anti-racism discourse in the Middle East, enabled by the internet. That process has accelerated. The final sentence called for a celebration and mobilization of Afro-Arab identity against tired Arab nationalist narratives and colonial separations. Since the 2011 uprisings in the Middle East, and especially with the passage of Tunisia's anti-racism law in October 2018, social media abounds with Afro-Arab activists and new collectives. These Black Arab voices run the gamut from socialist pan-Africanist feminists who quote Angela Davis to Afrocentrists who quote John Henry Clarke and his theory of Arabs overrunning Africa, a discourse last heard during the Save Darfur moment. The past is preface. Geopolitically, much has changed—and not changed. The Sudanese strongman Omar Al-Bashir was toppled by a protest movement and is in prison awaiting an International Criminal Court trial for war crimes committed in Darfur. Yet Sudan is still in America's crosshairs. The mass violence in South Sudan has not resonated with the American public, but the new Sudanese regime is still under heavy pressure from Washington to recognize Israel in exchange for a lifting of sanctions—coercion that could derail Sudan's transition. Brand activism continues as well. Save Darfur drew celebrities and corporate actors, as companies began selling Darfur underwear, video games and Timberland boots. Today retail companies are scrambling to capitalize on Black Lives Matter. Walmart has pledged to stop locking up so-called multicultural hair products in display cases and BAND-AID has released new bandages in different skin tones. In conclusion, it is worth recalling that before America's grand 'awokening' of 2020, there were protest movements in Sudan, Lebanon, Chile, Algeria, France and Spain centered on exclusion and state violence. It is exhilarating to watch a protest movement against state brutality, white supremacy, colonial memory, and Trump-inspired racist contagion spread around the world. But it is not clear that an American-style anti-racism can counter racism in societies elsewhere, with their own race regimes and constructs. More importantly, it is worth noting that a backlash to the current protests is in the offing. This counter-movement could easily attempt to unify a polarized nation with time-honored tactics of division and distraction: by smashing current links of solidarity and directing the collective anger and bereavement caused by American policy failures toward a domestic or international other, be that Iran, Venezuela, Sudan, or mosques in America, as happened in 2005.

His funeral was both personal and political. Inside the cavernous Fountain of Praise church in Houston, Texas, gospel songs played as images of Mr Floyd were shown on a large screen, interspersed with video from the marches inspired by his death. 
Speaking to the church by video link, Mr Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate in November's election, addressed Mr Floyd's six-year-old daughter.
""When there is justice for George Floyd, we will truly be on our way to racial justice in America. Then, Gianna, your daddy will have changed the world,"" he said. 
""We cannot leave this moment thinking we can once again turn away from racism that stings at our very soul, from systemic abuse that still plagues American life.""

In an emotional eulogy, Mr Floyd's niece, Brooke Williams, paid tribute to her uncle and issued a call to action. 
""My uncle was a father and a brother. He always moved people with his words,"" she said, fighting to hold back tears. ""That officer showed no remorse while watching my uncle's soul leaving his body."" 
 ""I can breathe. And as long as I'm breathing, justice will be served,"" she continued. ""Someone said make America great again, but when has America ever been great? This wasn't just a murder, this was a hate crime."" 
Mr Floyd, 46, was killed by a Minneapolis police officer who placed his knee on his neck for more than eight minutes, despite his persistent pleas that he could not breathe. 
In death, Mr Floyd became a symbol of the racial injustice that has haunted America for hundreds of years, and the face of an anti-racism movement that has spread around the world. 
Mr Floyd's death was just one in a long line of violent racial killings that shocked the US, but have so far failed to move it to action. His family was joined by the relatives of some of those other victims at the ceremony: Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Ahmaud Arbery and Trayvon Martin. 
The Rev Al Sharpton paid tribute to the relatives during his eulogy.
He told mourners: ""This is a time that we need to understand that they are going to do everything they can to delay these trials and delay the countability and try to wear this family down.
""Many that are standing and coming today ... will not be here for the long run. We must commit to this family, all of these families ... that until these people pay for what they did, we are going to be there with them. Lives like George's will not matter until somebody pays for the cost of taking their lives.""
Mass demonstrations have rocked the United States in the two weeks since he was killed, but they have also spread around the world, to London, Paris and Berlin. 
More than 6,000 people came to the same church on Monday for a public memorial. Today, a smaller crowd gathered for the private ceremony, wearing T-shirts emblazoned with Mr Floyd's last words: ""I can't breathe.""
Gary Birch, 55, travelled seven hours by car from Oklahoma City to pay his respects. 
""We wanted to show our support because this is going to be part of history. The word has changed. We just wanted to be here,"" he said outside the church. 
""Hopefully one day we can get to a place where racism isn't part of this country. Right now it's still very alive. We have to fight against it.""
In a busy day of tweeting, Donald Trump had not mentioned Mr Floyd's funeral by the time it was under way, instead focusing on issues including the police response to protests, insulting his former defence secretary James Mattis and spreading a conspiracy theory about a man in his 70s who was pushed to the ground and seriously injured while talking to police in Buffalo, New York."

""I was called a visual activist, because of the agenda I was promoting back then—which I still promote, even now.""
Since the early 2000s, Muholi, 48, has documented south-south South Africa's lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) experience. Although South Africa was the first country to enshrine the rights of lesbian and gay people in its constitution in 1996, social attitudes often lay behind legal protections.
""I needed to have those visual conversations,"" Muholi said. ""I've always produced images that respond to something, whether it's hate crimes or exclusion."" Muholi wants these images to capture the full range of black LGBTI lives. To change social attitudes, he said, his motto was, ""we need to produce as many images as we can.""
Hundreds of austere but stylized photographs by Muholi have been exhibited around the world. Now, a retrospective at the Tate Modern in London brings together more than 250 of his works. The opening was scheduled for 5 November, a few days before museums in England were closed in a second quarantine for the coronavirus. It opened on December 3, only to face a third quarantine. When it breaks, it will remain until May 31.
Gabi Ngcobo, an influential South African curator, commented that Muholi works in a ""sensitive, provocative, tender and playful way,"" using the camera as ""an instrument to dig, hold and affirm.""
These qualities are clear in the works included in the Tate exhibition, ranging from the playful laughter of two women in ""Sistahs"", a flirtatious black-and-white scene in a chamber, to ""Aftermath"", a disturbing shot in which a woman places her hands in front of her pubic area, with a scar all along her thigh. Both are taken from the series ""Only Half the Picture"".
The exhibition also includes portraits of the series ""Faces and Phases"", which follows Muholi's friends during their transition, and ""Somnyama Ngonyama"", a kind of visual diary.
Phindi Malaza, a lesbian feminist activist from Cape Town,said that long before the art world paid attention, Muholi used photography to give ""visibility to groups and communities that hadn't necessarily been on the agenda"" of policy makers, white LGBTI activists, or women's groups.
The 2005 ""Beloved"" series consists of five black-and-white photographs of two topless women in different poses: lying side by side, looking each other in the eye; a woman resting her head on each other's torso; staring at the distance, or boldly at the camera.
""Zanele focused on every aspect of black lesbian life,"" Malaza said. ""Not only the spectacular parts, but the common atmospheres they share with women who are not lesbians, showing that lesbians are normal women, not mysterious things.""
This approach was evident in his first solo exhibition""Visual Sexualities"",in 2003, at the Johannesburg Art Gallery. He got enthusiastic reviews; two years later, Muholi received the Tollman Award. Since then, he has received many accolades. A busy travel schedule has shaped recent works such as ""Somnyama Ngonyama"", which was photographed in cities in Africa, Europe and North America over the course of six years.
One of the photos in the series, ""Qiniso, the Sails,Durban,"" shows Muholi in profile, with his lips and eyelids bleached with toothpaste. Throughout the series, his skin seems darkened.
Like all his works, these photographs ask the viewer to reflect on how he sees others—and how power shapes what he sees.

There's a sudden wave of fireworks exploding in cities across the US. 
Here's what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. 
(You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.)
1. Coronavirus
Some alarming Covid-19 trends are emerging across several US states, and officials are desperately pleading with people to stay home, wear masks and keep their distance. California, Florida and Arizona are reporting thousands of new cases each day. And in Texas, health authorities have said new cases and hospitalizations are rising at their fastest rate yet. These are among 26 states -- a number also on the rise -- seeing new cases increase compared with the prior week. Despite warnings that Black Lives Matter protests across the country could lead to a jump in cases, new research suggests that's not happening. Instead, the latest surges stem from the number of places in the country that reopened too soon and too quickly. It's a stark contrast with other parts of the world. The situation in the US is so bad that European Union nations are discussing a recommendation to block American travelers.
2. Justice Department
Two Justice Department prosecutors will testify before the House Judiciary Committee today, accusing Attorney General William Barr and senior department officials of politicizing investigations. Aaron Zelinsky, a prosecutor on former special counsel Robert Mueller's team, plans to testify that the sentencing recommendation for Trump's longtime friend and adviser Roger Stone was watered down due to political pressure from the ""highest levels"" of DOJ, according to his prepared remarks. John Elias, a career prosecutor in the Antitrust Division, accused Barr of ordering investigations into 10 mergers of cannabis companies because he did not like the industry, according to a copy of his testimony. Their criticism comes just days after Barr's decision to fire Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, which has investigated Trump and his associates. 
3. NASCAR
Turns out the noose found Sunday in driver Bubba Wallace's garage at Talladega Superspeedway had been there as long ago as October. That's according to the FBI, which said yesterday that Wallace was not the victim of a hate crime. NASCAR, mentioning the FBI report, described the item as a ""garage door pull rope fashioned like a noose."" Wallace, the only Black driver in NASCAR's top circuit, said he's upset some in the public are now questioning his integrity. ""Whether tied in 2019 or whatever, it was a noose,"" he said. ""So, it wasn't directed at me but somebody tied a noose. That's what I'm saying.""
4. Mexico
A 7.4-magnitude earthquake hit Mexico's southern Oaxaca region yesterday, killing at least five people. The earthquake stuck around 10:30 a.m. local time, with an epicenter 6.8 miles southwest of Santa María Zapotitlán, near El Coyul. It collapsed buildings and prompted evacuations, even damaging hospitals that had been dealing with coronavirus patients. The quake could be felt as far as Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Tremors were also felt in the capital Mexico City, more than 200 miles away. The US Geological Survey said the damage in Oaxaca state is considered light to moderate -- relatively good news considering that Mexico is one of the world's most seismically active regions and has a long history of devastating earthquakes.
5. Canada
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is calling China's decision to charge two of his country's citizens with espionage clearly political. Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor were officially charged this week with spying and handling state secrets. The two men have been detained in China since 2018, in the weeks following the arrest in Vancouver of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of the Chinese technology company Huawei, on charges filed in the US. Trudeau is now under pressure to do something about the case of the ""two Michaels,"" possibly including facilitating a prisoner swap. The Prime Minister said he isn't considering a trade of the two men for the detained Huawei exec and has previously said intervening in the case would undermine the independence of the country's justice system.

197,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1251/Files (250).DOCX","Alliance News",2020-10-28,"806 words","Company Significant",NA,NA,"Twitter, Facebook And Google Bosses Face Grilling By US Senators",FALSE,"(Alliance News) - The chief executives of Twitter Inc, Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google have been criticised by US Republican senators for alleged anti-conservative bias in the companies' social media platforms and received a warning of coming restrictions from Congress.
Politicians from both parties are assessing the companies' power and are looking to challenge their long-enjoyed legal protections for online speech.
The Trump administration, seizing on unfounded accusations of bias against conservative views, has asked Congress to strip some of the protections that have generally shielded the tech companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.
""The time has come for that free pass to end,"" said Senator Roger Wicker, chair of the Senate Commerce, Science & Transportation Committee.
Republican Wicker said the laws governing online speech must be updated because ""the openness and freedom of the internet are under attack"".
He spoke at the opening of the hearing as Twitter boss Jack Dorsey, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Sundar Pichai waited to testify via video.
Wicker cited the move this month by Facebook and Twitter to limit dissemination of an unverified political story from the conservative-leaning New York Post about Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
The story, which was not confirmed by other publications, cited unverified emails from Mr Biden's son Hunter that were reportedly disclosed by President Donald Trump's allies.
Republicans, led by Trump, have accused the social media platforms, without evidence, of deliberately suppressing conservative, religious and anti-abortion views.
In their prepared testimony, Dorsey, Zuckerberg and Pichai addressed the proposals for changes to a provision of a 1996 law that has served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet.
Critics in both parties say that immunity under Section 230 enables the social media companies to abdicate their responsibility to impartially moderate content.
Zuckerberg acknowledged that Congress ""should update the law to make sure it's working as intended"".
Dorsey and Pichai urged caution in making any changes.
""Undermining Section 230 will result in far more removal of online speech and impose severe limitations on our collective ability to address harmful content and protect people online,"" Mr Dorsey said.
Pichai appealed to legislators ""to be very thoughtful about any changes to Section 230 and to be very aware of the consequences those changes might have on businesses and consumers"".
The hearing room was nearly empty except for Wicker and a few colleagues but their questioning was sharp as tempers flared among members.
""Twitter's conduct has by far been the most egregious,"" Republican senator Ted Cruz told Dorsey.
Cruz cited Twitter's limitations on the newspaper story as part of ""a pattern of censorship and silencing Americans with whom Twitter disagrees"".
Democratic senator Brian Schatz was critical of Republicans, saying the hearing was a ""sham"".
Trump earlier this year signed an executive order challenging the protections from legal action under the 1996 telecommunications law.
Assistant attorney general Stephen Boyd told congressional leaders in a letter on Tuesday that recent events have made the changes more urgent, and said the restrictions by Twitter and Facebook related to the newspaper story were ""quite concerning"".
Ajit Pai, chair of the independent Federal Communications Commission, recently announced plans to re-examine the legal protections – a change from the agency's previous position.
Social media giants are also under heavy scrutiny for their efforts to police misinformation about the US election.
Twitter and Facebook have imposed a misinformation label on content from the president, who has around 80 million followers.
Starting on Tuesday, Facebook did not accept any new political advertising.
Previously booked political ads will be able to run until the polls close November 3, when all political advertising will temporarily be banned.
Google, which owns YouTube, also is halting political ads after the polls close. Twitter banned all political ads last year.
Democrats have focused their criticism of social media mainly on hate speech, misinformation and other content that can incite violence or keep people from voting.
They have criticised the tech bosses for failing to police content, homing in on the platforms' role in hate crimes and the rise of white nationalism in the US.
Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have scrambled to stem the tide of material that incites violence and spreads lies and baseless conspiracy theories.
The executives rejected accusations of bias.
""We approach our work without political bias, full stop,"" Pichai said. ""To do otherwise would be contrary to both our business interests and our mission.""

The White House plans to announce executive actions Tuesday.
Three weeks of mostly peaceful protests around the nation have now followed the death on May 25 of Floyd at the knee of a white Minneapolis officer. But there have also been violent clashes between police and protesters, destruction, and acts of rage.
The Wendy’s restaurant where Brooks was shot was burned down over the weekend. And in Louisville, Kentucky, where no officers have been fired or charged in the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor in March, police said nine people were arrested Monday after demonstrators blocked traffic and threw a brick into a news station’s car while police shot them with pepper balls.
And in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the FBI is helping police investigate a shooting that critically injured a man during a confrontation Monday night between protesters and armed men protecting the statue of a Spanish conquistador. Police disarmed and detained the gunmen involved.
Albuquerque's mayor cited the shooting as evidence that the statue must be removed as soon as possible as a matter of public safety, and Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said there's no room in New Mexico for any escalation of “reckless, violent rhetoric” against the demonstrators.
Pleading through tears on Monday, Brooks' relatives also called for non-violence but insisted on changes in policing and criminal justice.
An autopsy found that Brooks, 27, was shot twice in the back. Two white officers had responded to calls about a man who was asleep at the wheel in a Wendy's drive-thru lane.
Police video showed him cooperating until a breath test determined his blood-alcohol level was over the legal limit and one of the officers moved to handcuff him. Brooks was wrestled to the ground, broke free and took off with a stun gun; a white officer shot him as he tried to run away.
“When does it stop? We’re not only pleading for justice. We’re pleading for change,” said his niece, Chassidy Evans.
Relatives described Brooks as a loving father of three daughters and a stepson who had a bright smile and a big heart and loved to dance. Evans said there was no reason for him “to be shot and killed like trash in the street for falling asleep in a drive-thru.”
Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard said he hopes to decide by midweek whether to bring charges in the Brooks case. Officer Garrett Rolfe, who fired the shots that killed Brooks, was fired, and the other officer at the scene, Devin Brosnan, was put on desk duty. Police Chief Erika Shields resigned.
Several Democratic lawmakers joined the protests and called for Georgia to repeal its citizen’s arrest and stand-your-ground laws, among a slate of other reforms.

Albuquerque, New Mexico, Mayor Tim Keller wants a new department of civilian social workers to provide another option for 911 callers.

Slain man's family makes tearful plea",FALSE,"ATLANTA — Pleading through tears Monday, the family of a black man killed by Atlanta police outside a drive-thru demanded changes in the criminal justice system and called on protesters to refrain from violence amid heightened tensions across the U.S. three weeks after George Floyd's death in Minneapolis.
An autopsy found that 27-year-old Rayshard Brooks was shot twice in the back late Friday by a white officer who was trying to arrest him at a fast food restaurant for being intoxicated behind the wheel of his car. Brooks tried to flee after wrestling with officers and grabbing a stun gun from one of them.
""Not only are we hurt, we are angry,” said Chassidy Evans, Brooks’ niece. “When does it stop? We’re not only pleading for justice. We’re pleading for change.”
About 20 of Brooks’ children, siblings, cousins and other family members sobbed at a news conference as more than 1,000 people gathered not far away at an NAACP-led protest outside the Georgia Capitol.
Floyd's death May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer pressed his knee into the black man's neck touched off demonstrations and scattered violence across the U.S., and Brooks' killing rekindled those protests in Atlanta. The Wendy’s restaurant where Brooks was shot was burned down over the weekend.
Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said she was ordering changes to police use-of-force policies, including requiring that officers receive continuous training in how to deescalate situations and use those techniques before taking action that could be fatal. She said she was also requiring officers to intervene if they saw a colleague using excessive force.
The mayor said that after Brooks' shooting, it was clear the city did not have ""another day, another minute, another hour to waste” in changing police practices.
Evans said there was no reason for her uncle “to be shot and killed like trash in the street for falling asleep in a drive-thru.”
""Rayshard has a family who loves him who would have gladly come and got him so he would be here with us today,” she said.
Relatives described Brooks as a loving father of three daughters and a stepson who had a bright smile and a big heart and loved to dance. His oldest daughter learned her father was slain while celebrating her eighth birthday with cupcakes and friends, wearing a special dress as she waited for Brooks to take her skating, said Justin Miller, an attorney for the family.
“There’s no justice that can ever make me feel happy about what's been done,"" said Tomika Miller, Brooks' widow. ""I can never get my husband back. ... I can never tell my daughter he’s coming to take you skating or for swimming lessons.”
She asked those demonstrating to “keep the protesting peaceful,” saying: “We want to keep his name positive and great.”
The NAACP protest took place as lawmakers returned to work after a three-month coronavirus shutdown. Several Democratic lawmakers joined protesters and called for Georgia to pass reforms including the repeal of the state's citizen's arrest and stand-your-ground laws.
While some Republican leaders pushed back against swift action on some proposals, GOP House Speaker David Ralston endorsed rapid passage of a hate-crimes law, telling lawmakers that failure to act would be ""a stain on this state we can never wash away.”
Morgan Dudley, 18, skipped work to join the demonstration after her job kept her from joining prior Atlanta protests following Floyd's death three weeks ago.
“I was like, ‘You know what? This is not a trend. This is an actual problem that we’re facing,’"" said Dudley, who is black.
Like Atlanta, officials nationwide are responding to calls for reform while protests persist.
New York City’s police department is disbanding the type of plainclothes anti-crime units that were involved in the 2014 death of Eric Garner and have long been criticized for aggressive tactics, Commissioner Dermot Shea said Monday.
In Chicago, Mayor Lori Lightfoot said a panel of residents, activists and one police official will review the Police Department's policy on when officers can use force. Albuquerque, New Mexico, Mayor Tim Keller said he wants a new department of social workers and civilian professionals to provide another option when someone calls 911.
And New Jersey's attorney general ordered police in the state to begin publicly divulging names of officers who commit serious disciplinary violations.
In the Atlanta shooting, Officer Garrett Rolfe, who fired the shots that killed Brooks, was fired, and the other officer at the scene, Devin Brosnan, was put on desk duty. Police Chief Erika Shields resigned a day after the shooting.
Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard said he hopes to decide by midweek whether to charge the officers. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation was took over the investigation.
Police had been called to the fast food restaurant because of complaints that a car was blocking the drive-thru lane. An officer found Brooks asleep in the car.
Police video showed Brooks cooperating with the officers for more than 40 minutes until a breath test determined his blood-alcohol level was over the legal limit. When one of the officers moved to handcuff him, Brooks tried to run and the officers took him to the ground.
Brooks broke free and took off with a stun gun but was shot. Rolfe told authorities that Brooks had fired the stun gun at him.
Asked why Brooks ran, family attorney L. Chris Stewart suggested that he may have feared for his life.
""They put George Floyd in handcuffs and he was subsequently killed,” Stewart said. “So just getting put in handcuffs if you’re African American doesn’t mean, oh, you’re going to get nicely taken to the back of a police car.”

This year, the Lawyers' Committee honors David Abney, Executive Chairman of UPS, with the 2020 A. Leon Higginbotham Corporate Leadership Award. The Award Event, now in its 20th year, recognizes corporate leaders who embody exemplary practices in promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace and celebrates civil rights icons.
""For the past 57 years, we have been on the front-lines in the fight to advance racial justice and equality across the nation,"" said Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. ""Our A. Leon Higginbotham Event shines a light on our work to advance racial justice, provides an opportunity to highlight corporations that exemplify best practices with respect to diversity and inclusion, and allows us to lift up champions for racial and social justice. We are proud to recognize UPS for their efforts to promote diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace.

Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms will be honored for her distinguished leadership in confronting the current health crisis and addressing the stark impact that the pandemic has had on communities of color.

Congressmember Bass holds many leadership roles and also serves as the Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus.

However, municipal departments and sub-units, including police departments, are generally not considered “persons” within the meaning of § 1983. Vance v. County of Santa Clara, 928 F.Supp 993, 995-96 (N.D.Cal.1996) (holding that “naming a municipal department as a defendant is not an appropriate means of pleading a § 1983 action against a municipality,” and dismissing the Santa Clara Department of Corrections from the action). Therefore, Plaintiff fails to state a claim as to the SFPD and has not named any proper defendant in his complaint. The Court further notes that although the City and County of San Francisco may be sued under § 1983, there is no vicarious liability under that statute, meaning that it can be held liable for constitutional violations arising from the conduct of its officers only if that conduct is the result of an official policy of the City and County of San Francisco. See Monell v. Dep't of Soc. Servs. of City of New York, 436 U.S 658, 694 (1978)(“it is when execution of a government’s policy or custom, whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy, inflicts the injury that the government as an entity is responsible under § 1983.”) Because Plaintiff has not alleged any official policy was the cause of the alleged violation of his right to Equal Protection, simply replacing the SFPD with the City and County of San Francisco will not cure the pleading deficiency. Second, to state a claim under 42 U.S.C § 1983 for a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment “a plaintiff must show that the defendants acted with an intent or purpose to discriminate against the plaintiff based upon membership in a protected class.” Barren v. Harrington, 152 F.3d 1193, 1194 (9th Cir. 1998). Plaintiff has alleged only that he was treated less favorably than a “regular citizen” without offering any additional allegations explaining this phrase. As a consequence, his complaint fails to raise a plausible inference that he Case 3:20-cv-04579-JCS Document 8 Filed 09/01/20 Page 2 of 3 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court Northern District of California was subject to discrimination based on his membership in a protected group such as race or national origin.

During a four-hour service broadcast live on every major U.S. television network from a church in Floyd's boyhood home of Houston, family members, clergy and politicians exhorted Americans to turn grief and outrage at his death into a moment of reckoning for the nation. George Floyd funeral. 
Reuters The funeral followed two weeks of protests ignited by graphic video footage of Floyd, 46, handcuffed and lying face down on a Minneapolis street while an officer kneels into the back of his neck for nearly nine minutes. The video shows Floyd gasping for air as he cries out, ""Mama,"" and groans, ""Please, I can't breathe,"" before falling silent and still. The officer, Derek Chauvin, 44, has since been charged with second-degree murder and three other officers with aiding and abetting Floyd's May 25 death. All were dismissed from the department a day after the incident. Floyd's dying words have become a rallying cry for tens of thousands of protesters around the globe who have since taken to the streets, undaunted by the coronavirus pandemic, demanding justice for Floyd and an end to mistreatment of minorities by U.S. law enforcement. ""I can breathe. And as long as I'm breathing, justice will be served,"" Floyd's niece Brooklyn Williams declared in a eulogy that drew applause from mourners inside the Fountain of Praise Church in Houston. ""This is not just a murder but a hate crime."" 'BIG FLOYD' Porsha Williams Instagram Williams was one of several relatives and friends, most dressed all in white, who addressed the service, remembering Floyd as a loving, larger-than-life personality. The memorial was punctuated by gospel music and a video montage of shared memories of the man affectionately known as ""Big Floyd."" His younger brother, Terrence Floyd, spoke about awakening in the middle of the night in recent days traumatized by the memory of seeing his older sibling calling out for their mother as he lay dying.

Al Sharpton called Floyd ""an ordinary brother"" who grew up in a Houston housing project but left behind a legacy of greatness despite rejections in jobs and sports that prevented him from achieving all that he once aspired to become. ""God took the rejected stone and made him the cornerstone of a movement that is going to change the whole wide world,"" Sharpton said, invoking a biblical parable from the New Testament. He added that the Floyd family would lead a march on Washington being organized for Aug. 28 to mark the 57th anniversary of the 1963 ""I Have a Dream"" speech given from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial by civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., assassinated in 1968. 'HOME-GOING CELEBRATION' Some 2,500 people attended the funeral, which followed memorial services last week in Minneapolis, where Floyd made his home after leaving Houston, and Raeford, the North Carolina town where he was born.

Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate in the Nov. 3 election, addressed the funeral service via a video recording, lamenting that ""too many black Americans wake up knowing that they could lose their life in the course of just living their life."" ""We must not turn away. We cannot leave this moment thinking we can once again turn away from racism,"" he said. Two voter registration tables were set up outside the church.

206,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1251/Files (250).DOCX","Associated Press State & Local",2020-06-15,"965 words","DOMESTIC NEWS; STATE AND REGIONAL","RUSS BYNUM and KATE BRUMBACK, Associated Press",NA,"'When does it stop?' Slain man's family makes tearful plea",FALSE,"ATLANTA (AP) — Pleading through tears Monday, the family of a black man killed by Atlanta police outside a drive-thru demanded changes in the criminal justice system and called on protesters to refrain from violence amid heightened tensions across the U.S. three weeks after George Floyd's death in Minneapolis.
An autopsy found that 27-year-old Rayshard Brooks was shot twice in the back late Friday by a white officer who was trying to arrest him at a fast food restaurant for being intoxicated behind the wheel of his car. Brooks tried to flee after wrestling with officers and grabbing a stun gun from one of them.
""Not only are we hurt, we are angry,” said Chassidy Evans, Brooks’ niece. “When does it stop? We’re not only pleading for justice. We’re pleading for change.”
About 20 of Brooks’ children, siblings, cousins and other family members sobbed at a news conference as more than 1,000 people gathered not far away at an NAACP-led protest outside the Georgia Capitol.
Floyd's death May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer pressed his knee into the black man's neck touched off demonstrations and scattered violence across the U.S., and Brooks' killing rekindled those protests in Atlanta. The Wendy’s restaurant where Brooks was shot was burned down over the weekend.
Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said she was ordering changes to police use-of-force policies, including requiring that officers receive continuous training in how to deescalate situations and use those techniques before taking action that could be fatal. She said she was also requiring officers to intervene if they saw a colleague using excessive force.
The mayor said that after Brooks' shooting, it was clear the city did not have ""another day, another minute, another hour to waste” in changing police practices.
Evans said there was no reason for her uncle “to be shot and killed like trash in the street for falling asleep in a drive-thru.”
""Rayshard has a family who loves him who would have gladly come and got him so he would be here with us today,” she said.
Relatives described Brooks as a loving father of three daughters and a stepson who had a bright smile and a big heart and loved to dance. His oldest daughter learned her father was slain while celebrating her eighth birthday with cupcakes and friends, wearing a special dress as she waited for Brooks to take her skating, said Justin Miller, an attorney for the family.
“There’s no justice that can ever make me feel happy about what's been done,"" said Tomika Miller, Brooks' widow. ""I can never get my husband back. ... I can never tell my daughter he’s coming to take you skating or for swimming lessons.”
She asked those demonstrating to “keep the protesting peaceful,” saying: “We want to keep his name positive and great.”
The NAACP protest took place as lawmakers returned to work after a three-month coronavirus shutdown. Several Democratic lawmakers joined protesters and called for Georgia to pass reforms including the repeal of the state's citizen's arrest and stand-your-ground laws.
While some Republican leaders pushed back against swift action on some proposals, GOP House Speaker David Ralston endorsed rapid passage of a hate-crimes law, telling lawmakers that failure to act would be ""a stain on this state we can never wash away.”
Morgan Dudley, 18, skipped work to join the demonstration after her job kept her from joining prior Atlanta protests following Floyd's death three weeks ago.
“I was like, ‘You know what? This is not a trend. This is an actual problem that we’re facing,’"" said Dudley, who is black.
Like Atlanta, officials nationwide are responding to calls for reform while protests persist.
New York City’s police department is disbanding the type of plainclothes anti-crime units that were involved in the 2014 death of Eric Garner and have long been criticized for aggressive tactics, Commissioner Dermot Shea said Monday.
In Chicago, Mayor Lori Lightfoot said a panel of residents, activists and one police official will review the Police Department's policy on when officers can use force. Albuquerque, New Mexico, Mayor Tim Keller said he wants a new department of social workers and civilian professionals to provide another option when someone calls 911.
And New Jersey's attorney general ordered police in the state to begin publicly divulging names of officers who commit serious disciplinary violations.
In the Atlanta shooting, Officer Garrett Rolfe, who fired the shots that killed Brooks, was fired, and the other officer at the scene, Devin Brosnan, was put on desk duty. Police Chief Erika Shields resigned a day after the shooting.
Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard said he hopes to decide by midweek whether to charge the officers. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation was took over the investigation.
Police had been called to the fast food restaurant because of complaints that a car was blocking the drive-thru lane. An officer found Brooks asleep in the car.
Police video showed Brooks cooperating with the officers for more than 40 minutes until a breath test determined his blood-alcohol level was over the legal limit. When one of the officers moved to handcuff him, Brooks tried to run and the officers took him to the ground.
Brooks broke free and took off with a stun gun but was shot. Rolfe told authorities that Brooks had fired the stun gun at him.
Asked why Brooks ran, family attorney L. Chris Stewart suggested that he may have feared for his life.
""They put George Floyd in handcuffs and he was subsequently killed,” Stewart said. “So just getting put in handcuffs if you’re African American doesn’t mean, oh, you’re going to get nicely taken to the back of a police car.”

Her caucus, wearing African Kente cloth scarves, had just finished kneeling for eight minutes and 46 seconds in silence to commemorate Floyd's death. She promised ""transformative structural change.""
The Democrats announced they were introducing a bill offering a host of police reforms, including banning the use of chokeholds and ""no-knock"" warrants, creating a national database of police abuse and mandating anti-bias training, requiring federal officers to wear body cameras, making it easier for victims of police violence to successfully sue, and make lynching a federal hate crime.
Republicans in Congress, who hold a majority in the Senate, were expected to oppose the reforms. Meanwhile, in cities elsewhere, municipal governments were also making promises of police reform in response to the protests - incrementally, some people in power were responding to the calls for change.
In the streets of Washington, where protests in the street were ongoing Monday, various protesters greeted the news with a mixture of cautious optimism and skepticism.
""I'm hopeful,"" Bree Walton, who has been outside protesting for the past seven days, said of the Democrats proposals. ""I'm hopeful that they're gonna be passed. Talking about it is great, and I'm glad that they are having this conversation. But we need to see action. We need to see change,"" Walton said. ""I think this is a great beginning. A great start. But we've a lot to work on.""
Directly in front of where Walton spoke was the mural painted on the road by the city of Washington spelling out ""Black Lives Matter"" in giant yellow letters, a symbol of support from the city government. Over the weekend, protesters had added an addendum to it: ""Defund the police,"" signalling protesters are demanding more than symbolic efforts.
""Defund the police"" has become a core rallying cry for protesters across the U.S., a demand that money be taken away from police departments and redirected to community supports to improve the lives of Black communities. It's a measure advocates say would boost community safety while also improving and saving lives. What those words mean to people ranges from demilitarizing and reforming law enforcement, to abolishing police departments.
Republicans, including President Donald Trump, have seized on the more extreme end of that spectrum as a wedge issue that may draw support to their contrasting ""law and order"" message. Trump has attempted to wield the ""defund police"" rallying cry against his political opponents - he tweeted that Joe Biden will defund police. That's a development many demonstrators might welcome, though the presumed Democratic candidate for president issued a statement Monday saying he did not support the concept.
But some city governments have begun acting on the idea. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio committed on Sunday to shift some funding from the police budget to youth and community services. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti announced last week he'd be proposing to cut $250 million from his city's police budget and direct it toward health, education and ""healing.""
Perhaps most dramatically, in Minneapolis, a vetoproof majority of the city council has announced they plan to dismantle the city's police department and replace it with new and different - though as yet unspecified - public safety measures.
""We are going to dismantle the Minneapolis Police Department. And when we're done, we're not simply gonna glue it back together. We are going to dramatically rethink how we approach public safety and emergency response. It's really past due,"" Jeremiah Ellison, one of the Minneapolis council members, promised on Twitter.
That promise was welcomed by local protest movement organizers. ""It shouldn't have taken so much death to get us here,"" Kandace Montgomery, director of Black Visions Collective, one of the most vocal organizations pressing for change in Minneapolis both before and since Floyd's death, said in a statement. ""George Floyd should not have been murdered for so many people to wake up. It shouldn't have taken young Black folks risking their lives in these streets, over and over.""
Another organizer with Black Visions Collective, Miski Noor, said the announcement marked a day ""to make history.""
That is a sentiment I have heard at protests in Washington throughout the past week - that history is being made. It's an impression underlined by the apparent shift in public opinion evident in polls towards wanting reforms to policing in response to well-documented instances of racism, and by the number of bodies in the streets protesting that has only grown across the country in the days since Floyd's death. On Sunday, Mitt Romney, a Republican senator and former presidential candidate, joined a protest march, a possible indication of how widespread the sense that change is needed has become.
As the movement message spreads from the street into the corridors of power and is codified in proposed legislative changes, the question is how extensive changes will be - and if the proposals can overcome the resistance of those who still claim it is not needed."

209,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1251/Files (250).DOCX","The Associated Press",2020-06-11,"963 words","POLITICAL NEWS","LISA MASCARO, AP Congressional Correspondent",NA,"Senate GOP readies policing bill after Floyd death, protests",FALSE,"WASHINGTON — Venturing into a new priority, Senate Republicans are quickly compiling a package of policing changes after George Floyd's death that would create a national database of use-of-force incidents, encourage police body cameras and include a long-stalled effort to make lynching a federal hate crime.
The burst of political energy reflects how swiftly the national conversation over police and racial injustice is upturning business as usual in Washington. The emerging GOP bill doesn’t go as far as a sweeping new Democratic package, but it includes several similar provisions. What's unclear is if President Donald Trump will back any of the proposed changes.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, whose home state of Kentucky faces unrest over the police shooting of Breonna Taylor, indicated Thursday the legislation would be ready soon.
“The killing of black Americans like George Floyd and Breonna Taylor have accelerated important conversations,” McConnell said as he opened the Senate.
The party that has long favored a “law and order” approach — seen in Trump's reaction to the nationwide demonstrations over Floyd's death — finds itself trying to adapt to a fast-changing national dialogue on police and race as the Black Lives Matter movement gains worldwide prominence.
""This is an issue whose time has come,"" Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., the GOP's only black senator, said Thursday on the “Today” show.
A group of GOP senators led by Scott is meeting behind closed doors and with the White House on the legislation. Despite a push to produce a package this week, the deadline is slipping as details are being compiled. It is expected to be released early next week, according to a senior GOP aide unauthorized to discuss the situation and granted anonymity.
Central to the package will be a new national database of use-of-force incidents, similar to one included in the Democratic bill. It's a concept both parties support as a way to track potential police misconduct and ensure officers cannot simply transfer from one department to another without public disclosure of their records.
Scott said the provision would be named the “Breonna Taylor Reporting Act” and it would include not only the tracking of use-of-force incidents but also no-knock warrants such as police used to enter the 26-year-old woman's home. The database proposal expands on a similar bill Scott introduced in 2015 after Walter Scott — no relation — was killed by police in South Carolina.
Unlike the House Democratic bill, which would ban police choke holds, the Republican bill appears to be more focused on providing training for officers to de-escalate confrontations.
It would also include “duty to intervene” provisions so other officers would step up to stop misconduct, Scott said.
“We're trying to provide the resources necessary to retrain these local departments,” he said.
One area of uncertainty is over so-called “qualified immunity,” which the Democrats' bill adjusts to make it easier for injured individuals to claim damages in civil suits against police offices. The White House has said it was a nonstarter and it is not likely to be included in the Senate bill.
Agreement, though, is quickly forming around the anti-lynching bill, a long-stalled effort that has previously been approved by both the House and Senate but was being held up last week by objections from a lone Republican, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky.
Paul has pushed instead for other measures, including changes to no-knock warrants and an end to the practice of sending surplus military equipment to local police departments. Both of those are included in the Democrats' bill but not likely to be included in the Senate GOP package.
Democrats have so far panned the GOP effort as insufficient compared with their own far-reaching proposal, built from decades of work by the Congressional Black Caucus tracking police and racial issues. The House is expected to approve the Democrats' bill in mid-June.
“The moment does not call for cherry-picking one or two things to do. It calls for bold and broad-scale change,” said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York.
Schumer has compared this moment in the aftermath of Floyd's death with the GOP approach to gun violence legislation after mass shootings, when lawmakers try to find consensus but end up doing nothing.
“We cannot go through those same motions again,” he said. “This is about the original sin of America, that we must try to deal with head-on.”
In the House, GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California signaled a willingness to engage on the issue.
“I think there’s a lot of concepts that we agree upon,"" McCarthy told reporters.
McCarthy said he favored a ban on choke holds.
It was a changed tone to match a national mood that is shifting after the death of Floyd and many other Americans at the hands of police, especially as ubiquitous cell phones often catch videos of the incidents.
McConnell said the Senate is “preparing to add to the conversations surrounding law enforcement with our own serious proposal.” He said the policies would “take smart steps without attacking the vast majority of police officers who bravely do their jobs the right way.”
Trump and Republicans have criticized activists' calls to defund the police — and Democrats also distanced themselves from that approach, which is not part of their bill. The defund movement is an overarching term to describe a range of options, from dismantling departments to shifting resources to mental health and other community services. The Democratic bill would instead provide grant money to departments that want to consider new ways of policing.
The White House has dispatched top aides to work with Senate Republicans, and Trump’s views on any final deal will remain key to its support."

'I just feel like there is a level of self-hate or just a lack of care for the rest of your Latin brother and sisters who are in cages who are being demonized by this president. I mean, hate crimes against Latin people are way up,' he said[1]. 'I mean, 23 people were shot in El Paso for just being Latin and you don't care so you're going to go for this braggadocio president?

It says that although a majority of Latino voters favor Democrats, 'Hispanic men are a small but enduring part of Trump's base. Those supporters see him as forceful, unapologetic and a symbol of economic success.' Geraldo L. Cadava, author of 'The Hispanic Republican: The Shaping of an American Political Identity, from Nixon to Trump,' told NBC News[8] in June that the Latin community is loyal to the conservative movement. 'Decades ago, Hispanic Republicans voted for the man, like Reagan or Bush, not the party,' Cadava said. 'Now that script has flipped. Hispanic Republicans support the party, which they believe in, even if they don't love the man.

The Democrats announced they were introducing a bill offering a host of police reforms, including banning the use of chokeholds and ""no-knock"" warrants, creating a national database of police abuse and mandating anti-bias training, requiring federal officers to wear body cameras, making it easier for victims of police violence to successfully sue, and make lynching a federal hate crime. Republicans in Congress, who hold a majority in the Senate, were expected to oppose the reforms. Meanwhile, in cities elsewhere, municipal governments were also making promises of police reform in response to the protests - incrementally, some people in power were responding to the calls for change.
In the streets of Washington, where protests in the street were ongoing Monday, various protesters greeted the news with a mixture of cautious optimism and skepticism.
""I'm hopeful,"" Bree Walton, who has been outside protesting for the past seven days, said of the Democrats proposals. ""I'm hopeful that they're gonna be passed. Talking about it is great, and I'm glad that they are having this conversation. But we need to see action. We need to see change,"" Walton said. ""I think this is a great beginning. A great start. But we've a lot to work on.""
Directly in front of where Walton spoke was the mural painted on the road by the city of Washington spelling out ""Black Lives Matter"" in giant yellow letters, a symbol of support from the city government. Over the weekend, protesters had added an addendum to it: ""Defund the police,"" signalling protesters are demanding more than symbolic efforts.
""Defund the police"" has become a core rallying cry for protesters across the U.S., a demand that money be taken away from police departments and redirected to community supports to improve the lives of Black communities. It's a measure advocates say would boost community safety while also improving and saving lives. What those words mean to people ranges from demilitarizing and reforming law enforcement, to abolishing police departments.
Republicans, including President Donald Trump, have seized on the more extreme end of that spectrum as a wedge issue that may draw support to their contrasting ""law and order"" message. Trump has attempted to wield the ""defund police"" rallying cry against his political opponents - he tweeted that Joe Biden will defund police. That's a development many demonstrators might welcome, though the presumed Democratic candidate for president issued a statement Monday saying he did not support the concept.
But some city governments have begun acting on the idea. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio committed on Sunday to shift some funding from the police budget to youth and community services. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti announced last week he'd be proposing to cut $250 million from his city's police budget and direct it towards health, education, and ""healing.""
Perhaps most dramatically, in Minneapolis, a vetoproof majority of the city council has announced they plan to dismantle the city's police department and replace it with new and different - though as yet unspecified - public safety measures.
""We are going to dismantle the Minneapolis Police Department. And when we're done, we're not simply gonna glue it back together. We are going to dramatically rethink how we approach public safety and emergency response. It's really past due,"" Jeremiah Ellison, one of the Minneapolis council members, promised on Twitter.
That promise was welcomed by local protest movement organizers. ""It shouldn't have taken so much death to get us here,"" Kandace Montgomery, director of Black Visions Collective, one of the most vocal organizations pressing for change in Minneapolis both before and since Floyd's death, said in a statement. ""George Floyd should not have been murdered for so many people to wake up. It shouldn't have taken young Black folks risking their lives in these streets, over and over.""
Another organizer with Black Visions Collective, Miski Noor, said the announcement marked a day ""to make history.""
That is a sentiment I have heard at protests in Washington throughout the past week - that history is being made. It's an impression underlined by the apparent shift in public opinion evident in polls towards wanting reforms to policing in response to well-documented instances of racism, and by the number of bodies in the streets protesting that has only grown across the country in the days since Floyd's death. On Sunday, Mitt Romney, a Republican senator and former presidential candidate, joined a protest march, a possible indication of how widespread the sense that change is needed has become.
As the movement message spreads from the street into the corridors of power and is codified in proposed legislative changes, the question is how extensive changes will be - and if the proposals can overcome the resistance of those who still claim it is not needed.

The black man whose death roused worldwide protests against racial injustice, was described during Wednesday's service as ""an ordinary brother"" transformed by fate into the ""cornerstone of a movement"".
During a four-hour service, shown live on every major US television network from a church in Mr Floyd's boyhood home of Houston, family members, clergy and politicians exhorted Americans to turn grief and outrage at his death into a moment of reckoning for the nation.
He was buried next to his mum Larcenia Floyd -known affectionately as 'Miss Cissy' -who died two years ago and whose name was tattooed on his torso.
The funeral followed two weeks of protests ignited by graphic video footage of Mr Floyd, 46, handcuffed and lying face down on a Minneapolis street while a white officer kneels into the back of his neck for nearly nine minutes.
The video shows Mr Floyd gasping for air as he cries out, ""Mama,"" and groans, ""please, I can't breathe,"" before falling silent and still.
The officer, Derek Chauvin, 44, has since been charged with second-degree murder and three other officers with aiding and abetting Mr Floyd's May 25 death.
 His dying words have become a rallying cry for tens of thousands of protesters around the globe who have since taken to the streets, undaunted by the coronavirus pandemic, demanding justice for Floyd and an end to mistreatment of minorities by US law enforcement. 
""I can breathe. And as long as I'm breathing, justice will be served,"" Mr Floyd's niece Brooke Williams declared in a eulogy that drew applause from mourners inside the Fountain of Praise Church in Houston.
""This is not just a murder but a hate crime.""
 She then went on to call out President Donald Trump, asking: ""When has America ever been great"" 
Ms Williams was one of several relatives and friends, most dressed all in white, who addressed the service, remembering Mr Floyd as a loving, larger-than-life personality.
The memorial was punctuated by gospel music and a video montage of shared memories of the man affectionately known as 'Big Floyd'.
His younger brother, Terrence Floyd, spoke about awakening in the middle of the night in recent days traumatized by the memory of seeing his older sibling calling out for their mother as he lay dying.
Another brother, Philonise, sobbing in grief, told mourners, ""George was my personal superman.""
Taking the stage to deliver the main eulogy, the Reverend Al Sharpton, a prominent civil rights activist and television commentator, called Mr Floyd ""an ordinary brother"" who left behind a legacy of greatness despite shortcomings that prevented him from achieving all that he once aspired to become.
""God took the rejected stone and made him the cornerstone of a movement that is going to change the whole wide world,"" Rev'd Sharpton said.
He added that the Floyd family would lead a march on Washington being organised for August 28 to mark the 57th anniversary of the 1963 ""I Have a Dream"" speech given from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial by slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., assassinated in 1968.
Some 2,500 people attended the funeral, which followed memorial services last week in Minneapolis, where Mr Floyd made his home after leaving Houston, and Raeford, the North Carolina town where he was born.
More than 6,000 people filed past Mr Floyd's open casket on Tuesday as he lay in repose inside the church.
""This is a home-going celebration,"" the Reverend Mia Wright, co-pastor at the church, told mourners.
Banners featured pop art illustrations of Mr Floyd wearing a baseball cap with a halo above it.
American flags lined the streets outside the church. Flowers and bouquets were placed around a photograph of Mr Floyd.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate in the November 3 election, addressed the service via a video recording, lamenting that ""too many black Americans wake up knowing that they could lose their life in the course of just living their life"".
""We must not turn away. We cannot leave this moment thinking we can once again turn away from racism,"" he said.
Two voter registration tables were set up outside the church.
Among those in attendance were loved ones of several other black men killed by white police or white civilians.
The mother of Eric Garner, the New York man who died in a police chokehold in 2014, was present, as was the family of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Georgia man who was shot and killed in February while jogging.
Three white men were charged in his death.
But it was the chillingly graphic video of Mr Floyd's death that triggered an outpouring of rage like no other such killing in recent memory, reinvigorating the Black Lives Matter movement and thrusting demands for racial justice to the top of the political agenda in the United States and around the world.
Fallout from Mr Floyd's death, and reaction to a spate of arson and looting that accompanied some of the otherwise mostly peaceful protests, also plunged Trump into one of the biggest crises of his tenure.
A Republican, Trump repeatedly threatened to order the military onto the streets to quell protests, focusing on restoring order while saying little about the US racial wounds at the root of the upheavals."

GLAAD: ""Confirming Barrett will drag America backwards. We cannot allow her to represent President Trump's bigotry and bullying at the Supreme Court for decades to come.""
Barrett's stated views directly threaten LGBTQ people's rights, many afforded by the Court, including protections from discrimination and marriage equality
NEW YORK, NY - GLAAD, the world's largest LGBTQ media advocacy organization, today condemned President Trump's nomination of Amy Coney Barrett for the U.S. Supreme Court to succeed late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Barrett's views against LGBTQ rights are alarming, as are her associations with influential anti-LGBTQ groups responsible for her nomination, and her lack of support for settled law affirming LGBTQ rights.
""If confirmed, Amy Coney Barrett will be a vote to undermine hard-won rights critical to all LGBTQ people, women and immigrants. Health care, reproductive rights, our legal rights to marry who we love or not be fired for who we are, are all at risk,"" said GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis. ""Anti-LGBTQ activists supporting Barrett are wrongly claiming she is being targeted for her religion, when the focus is on her record. Barrett has voted against access to abortion, she has spoken out against LGBTQ rights, she would be the deciding vote to take away health care for millions in the middle of a deadly, out-of-control pandemic. Confirming Barrett will drag America backwards. We cannot allow her to represent President Trump's bigotry and bullying at the Supreme Court for decades to come.""
In 2018, President Trump reportedly told confidants he was ""saving"" Barrett's nomination for Justice Ginsburg's seat. Unlike Ginsburg, Barrett has no record of achievement for women's rights. She criticized the ruling protecting affordable health care for millions of Americans. She has repeatedly ruled to restrict access to abortion and outlined ways to further undermine it. Barrett supported dissenters to the landmark marriage equality ruling, spoke out against it, and questioned the rights of transgender people and students.
Ruth Bader Ginsburg litigated before the U.S. Supreme Court, winning five of six cases she represented to advance women's rights. In her 27 years on the Court, Justice Ginsburg voted to expand LGBTQ rights in every case before her, including joining the 5-4 majorities in the landmark marriage equality cases, Windsor, Perry and finally, Obergefell, the case that opened all the rights and privileges of marriage to same-sex couples nationwide in 2015. These rights are in jeopardy with Barrett joining the all-male dissenters on the Supreme Court.
Barrett's anti-LGBTQ record:
Signing onto a letter in 2015, four months after marriage equality was granted nationwide, voicing her belief that marriage is between a man and a woman, and stating her belief that ""the Constitution does not expressly protect a right to privacy""
Barrett gave a lecture paid for by the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), a Southern Poverty Law Center designated anti-LGBTQ hate group, and the most extreme anti-LGBTQ legal organization
Barrett joined the Southern Poverty Law Center designated anti-LGBTQ hate group Family Research Council (FRC) in signing a letter recognizing ""life from conception""
Anti-LGBTQ activists praised Barrett upon word of her pending nomination including: FRC President Tony Perkins, President of the National Organization for Marriage Brian S. Brown, President of the Florida Family Policy Council John Stemberger, American Family Radio host Bryan Fischer, and Alabama Judge Roy Moore.
Barrett was vetted for the Trump campaign and Trump White House by The Federalist Society, which has argued against every major LGBTQ policy proposal including extending Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to include LGBTQ workers, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, hate crimes legislation, Don't Ask Don't Tell, and transgender accommodations. The Federalist Society was instrumental in the divisive nomination of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and the nominations of Justices Neil Gorsuch, Samuel Alito, and Chief Justice Roberts. If confirmed, Barrett would be the sixth member of The Federalist Society on the U.S. Supreme Court, increasing the risk of inflicting its anti-LGBTQ ideology on Americans
Barrett also was vetted and considered to be a ""stellar"" judge, by the anti-LGBTQ Heritage Foundation, which has made false claims that marriage equality would make people less monogamous, increase abortions, and eventually lead to ""group marriage."" The Heritage Foundation also consistently opposes transgender rights
Barrett is the third Supreme Court nomination by President Trump, an unprecedented number of nominations for an impeached, thus-far one-term presidency. As a candidate, Donald Trump stated he disagreed with the Supreme Court's marriage equality ruling in Obergefell and said he would ""strongly consider"" appointing judges who would overturn the decision
Should Barrett be confirmed, marriage equality would not be the only Supreme Court precedent in jeopardy. As a candidate, Donald Trump stated he will only appoint anti-choice judges to the court, and that he wants to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that recognized the constitutional right to privacy extends to a woman's right to make personal medical decisions, including access to abortion. President Trump's first two nominees, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, have already voted on the Court to uphold a restrictive law in Louisiana, joining a 5-4 dissent. Barrett has a clear anti-abortion rights judicial record. She has indicated she believes the Roe decision was ""erroneous,"" and has expressed a willingness to overturn existing legal precedent.
GLAAD also condemns President Trump's nomination of Barrett and the extreme haste to confirm her in light of voting already in progress across the country to determine the outcome of the 2020 Presidential Election and several key Senate races. Early voting is already underway in nine states and ballots are being mailed across the country. A majority of Americans support waiting for the outcome of the 2020 election to allow the winner to make, and the next U.S. Senate to confirm, this lifetime appointment.
We will forcefully and loudly oppose attempts to silence the voices already speaking out with their votes about this critical nomination, made by an historically unpopular President, that will harm millions of vulnerable Americans for generations to come.

Slain man's family makes tearful plea",FALSE,"ATLANTA (AP) — Pleading through tears Monday, the family of a black man killed by Atlanta police outside a drive-thru demanded changes in the criminal justice system and called on protesters to refrain from violence amid heightened tensions across the U.S. three weeks after George Floyd's death in Minneapolis.
An autopsy found that 27-year-old Rayshard Brooks was shot twice in the back late Friday by a white officer who was trying to arrest him at a fast food restaurant for being intoxicated behind the wheel of his car. Brooks tried to flee after wrestling with officers and grabbing a stun gun from one of them.
""Not only are we hurt, we are angry,” said Chassidy Evans, Brooks’ niece. “When does it stop? We’re not only pleading for justice. We’re pleading for change.”
About 20 of Brooks’ children, siblings, cousins and other family members sobbed at a news conference as more than 1,000 people gathered not far away at an NAACP-led protest outside the Georgia Capitol.
Floyd's death May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer pressed his knee into the black man's neck touched off demonstrations and scattered violence across the U.S., and Brooks' killing rekindled those protests in Atlanta. The Wendy’s restaurant where Brooks was shot was burned down over the weekend.
Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said she was ordering changes to police use-of-force policies, including requiring that officers receive continuous training in how to deescalate situations and use those techniques before taking action that could be fatal. She said she was also requiring officers to intervene if they saw a colleague using excessive force.
The mayor said that after Brooks' shooting, it was clear the city did not have ""another day, another minute, another hour to waste” in changing police practices.
Evans said there was no reason for her uncle “to be shot and killed like trash in the street for falling asleep in a drive-thru.”
""Rayshard has a family who loves him who would have gladly come and got him so he would be here with us today,” she said.
Relatives described Brooks as a loving father of three daughters and a stepson who had a bright smile and a big heart and loved to dance. His oldest daughter learned her father was slain while celebrating her eighth birthday with cupcakes and friends, wearing a special dress as she waited for Brooks to take her skating, said Justin Miller, an attorney for the family.
“There’s no justice that can ever make me feel happy about what's been done,"" said Tomika Miller, Brooks' widow. ""I can never get my husband back. ... I can never tell my daughter he’s coming to take you skating or for swimming lessons.”
She asked those demonstrating to “keep the protesting peaceful,” saying: “We want to keep his name positive and great.”
The NAACP protest took place as lawmakers returned to work after a three-month coronavirus shutdown. Several Democratic lawmakers joined protesters and called for Georgia to pass reforms including the repeal of the state's citizen's arrest and stand-your-ground laws.
While some Republican leaders pushed back against swift action on some proposals, GOP House Speaker David Ralston endorsed rapid passage of a hate-crimes law, telling lawmakers that failure to act would be ""a stain on this state we can never wash away.”
Morgan Dudley, 18, skipped work to join the demonstration after her job kept her from joining prior Atlanta protests following Floyd's death three weeks ago.
“I was like, ‘You know what? This is not a trend. This is an actual problem that we’re facing,’"" said Dudley, who is black.
Like Atlanta, officials nationwide are responding to calls for reform while protests persist.
New York City’s police department is disbanding the type of plainclothes anti-crime units that were involved in the 2014 death of Eric Garner and have long been criticized for aggressive tactics, Commissioner Dermot Shea said Monday.
In Chicago, Mayor Lori Lightfoot said a panel of residents, activists and one police official will review the Police Department's policy on when officers can use force. Albuquerque, New Mexico, Mayor Tim Keller said he wants a new department of social workers and civilian professionals to provide another option when someone calls 911.
And New Jersey's attorney general ordered police in the state to begin publicly divulging names of officers who commit serious disciplinary violations.
In the Atlanta shooting, Officer Garrett Rolfe, who fired the shots that killed Brooks, was fired, and the other officer at the scene, Devin Brosnan, was put on desk duty. Police Chief Erika Shields resigned a day after the shooting.
Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard said he hopes to decide by midweek whether to charge the officers. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation was took over the investigation.
Police had been called to the fast food restaurant because of complaints that a car was blocking the drive-thru lane. An officer found Brooks asleep in the car.
Police video showed Brooks cooperating with the officers for more than 40 minutes until a breath test determined his blood-alcohol level was over the legal limit. When one of the officers moved to handcuff him, Brooks tried to run and the officers took him to the ground.
Brooks broke free and took off with a stun gun but was shot. Rolfe told authorities that Brooks had fired the stun gun at him.
Asked why Brooks ran, family attorney L. Chris Stewart suggested that he may have feared for his life.
""They put George Floyd in handcuffs and he was subsequently killed,” Stewart said. “So just getting put in handcuffs if you’re African American doesn’t mean, oh, you’re going to get nicely taken to the back of a police car.”

ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today mourns the loss of U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-GA, an iconic leader who played a pivotal role in the events of the Civil Rights Era, from the Freedom Rides, to Bloody Sunday, to the March on Washington, where he delivered one of the keynote addresses at the age of 23 as the youngest speaker to take the stage. Congressman Lewis repeatedly and bravely risked his life to promote the philosophy of political nonviolence to help to achieve the dream of equality.
""We are devastated to learn of the passing of my hero, friend and civil rights icon, Rep. John Lewis,"" said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. ""John devoted his life to the pursuit of justice and taught the world about the importance of making what he called 'good trouble.' Lewis was a fearless leader whose courage and heroism were on display each and every day as he fought for a more just world.""
""What he did not only for the African-American community, but for the entire country stands as an example of courage and of heroism. We were fortunate to have him in our ranks as a supporter and friend through the decades,"" said Esta Epstein, Chair of the ADL Board of Directors.
In addition to his leadership in the House, Rep. Lewis was a close friend of ADL and a lifelong supporter of ADL's mission to achieve justice and fair treatment to all. Rep. Lewis stood shoulder to shoulder with ADL leaders as they worked to advance federal hate crimes legislation in the House and Senate and toward the passage of hate crime laws in all 50 states. He was likewise a strong supporter of the Equality Act and the Voting Rights Advancement Act; and he worked with ADL in response to the white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, and proudly served as a member of the ADL Centennial Committee in 2013.
That same year, he was honored at ADL's In Concert Against Hate at the Kennedy Center for a lifetime of public service and his courage in advancing the ideals of the civil rights movement in America. He was presented with ADL's Lifetime Achievement Award by ADL's Southeast Region on March 16, and will be posthumously celebrated in an upcoming July 30 webinar.
Throughout his life, Rep. Lewis also spoke out strongly against antisemitism, and, most recently in the wake of horrific antisemitic attacks in Pittsburgh, Poway and Monsey, used his voice and his bully pulpit to speak out strongly against acts of hatred against Jews and other minorities.
""He not only is the moral compass for all we do fighting the good fight but as we look to fight hate every day, his tenacity, his ability to stick through things and to continuously show leadership, inspired us all,"" said Allison Padilla-Goodman, Vice President, ADL Southern Division. ""We will deeply miss his leadership and expresses our sincere condolences to his entire family.""
Race and Racial Justice
ADL is the world's leading anti-hate organization. Founded in 1913 in response to an escalating climate of anti-Semitism and bigotry, its timeless mission is to protect the Jewish people and to secure justice and fair treatment for all. Today, ADL continues to fight all forms of hate with the same vigor and passion. A global leader in exposing extremism, delivering anti-bias education, and fighting hate online, ADL is the first call when acts of anti-Semitism occur. ADL's ultimate goal is a world in which no group or individual suffers from bias, discrimination or hate."

The burst of political energy reflects how swiftly the national conversation over police and racial injustice is upturning business as usual in Washington. The emerging GOP bill doesn’t go as far as a sweeping new Democratic package, but it includes several similar provisions. What's unclear is if President Donald Trump will back any of the proposed changes.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, whose home state of Kentucky faces unrest over the police shooting of Breonna Taylor, indicated Thursday the legislation would be ready soon.
“The killing of black Americans like George Floyd and Breonna Taylor have accelerated important conversations,” McConnell said as he opened the Senate.
The party that has long favored a “law and order” approach — seen in Trump's reaction to the nationwide demonstrations over Floyd's death — finds itself trying to adapt to a fast-changing national dialogue on police and race as the Black Lives Matter movement gains worldwide prominence.
""This is an issue whose time has come,"" Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., the GOP's only black senator, said Thursday on the “Today” show.
A group of GOP senators led by Scott is meeting behind closed doors and with the White House on the legislation. Despite a push to produce a package this week, the deadline is slipping as details are being compiled. It is expected to be released early next week, according to a senior GOP aide unauthorized to discuss the situation and granted anonymity.
Central to the package will be a new national database of use-of-force incidents, similar to one included in the Democratic bill. It's a concept both parties support as a way to track potential police misconduct and ensure officers cannot simply transfer from one department to another without public disclosure of their records.
Scott said the provision would be named the “Breonna Taylor Reporting Act” and it would include not only the tracking of use-of-force incidents but also no-knock warrants such as police used to enter the 26-year-old woman's home. The database proposal expands on a similar bill Scott introduced in 2015 after Walter Scott — no relation — was killed by police in South Carolina.
Unlike the House Democratic bill, which would ban police choke holds, the Republican bill appears to be more focused on providing training for officers to de-escalate confrontations.
It would also include “duty to intervene” provisions so other officers would step up to stop misconduct, Scott said.
“We're trying to provide the resources necessary to retrain these local departments,” he said.
One area of uncertainty is over so-called “qualified immunity,” which the Democrats' bill adjusts to make it easier for injured individuals to claim damages in civil suits against police offices. The White House has said it was a nonstarter and it is not likely to be included in the Senate bill.
Agreement, though, is quickly forming around the anti-lynching bill, a long-stalled effort that has previously been approved by both the House and Senate but was being held up last week by objections from a lone Republican, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky.
Paul has pushed instead for other measures, including changes to no-knock warrants and an end to the practice of sending surplus military equipment to local police departments. Both of those are included in the Democrats' bill but not likely to be included in the Senate GOP package.
Democrats have so far panned the GOP effort as insufficient compared with their own far-reaching proposal, built from decades of work by the Congressional Black Caucus tracking police and racial issues. The House is expected to approve the Democrats' bill in mid-June.
“The moment does not call for cherry-picking one or two things to do. It calls for bold and broad-scale change,” said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York.
Schumer has compared this moment in the aftermath of Floyd's death with the GOP approach to gun violence legislation after mass shootings, when lawmakers try to find consensus but end up doing nothing.
“We cannot go through those same motions again,” he said. “This is about the original sin of America, that we must try to deal with head-on.”
In the House, GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California signaled a willingness to engage on the issue.
“I think there’s a lot of concepts that we agree upon,"" McCarthy told reporters.
McCarthy said he favored a ban on choke holds.
It was a changed tone to match a national mood that is shifting after the death of Floyd and many other Americans at the hands of police, especially as ubiquitous cell phones often catch videos of the incidents.

220,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1251/Files (250).DOCX","Canadian Press",2020-06-11,"963 words","INTERNATIONAL","Lisa Mascaro, The Associated Press",NA,"Senate GOP readies policing bill after Floyd death, protests; Senate GOP readies policing bill after Floyd death, protests",FALSE,"WASHINGTON - Venturing into a new priority, Senate Republicans are quickly compiling a package of policing changes after George Floyd's death that would create a national database of use-of-force incidents, encourage police body cameras and include a long-stalled effort to make lynching a federal hate crime.
The burst of political energy reflects how swiftly the national conversation over police and racial injustice is upturning business as usual in Washington. The emerging GOP bill doesn't go as far as a sweeping new Democratic package, but it includes several similar provisions. What's unclear is if President Donald Trump will back any of the proposed changes.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, whose home state of Kentucky faces unrest over the police shooting of Breonna Taylor, indicated Thursday the legislation would be ready soon.
""The killing of black Americans like George Floyd and Breonna Taylor have accelerated important conversations,"" McConnell said as he opened the Senate.
The party that has long favoured a ""law and order"" approach - seen in Trump's reaction to the nationwide demonstrations over Floyd's death - finds itself trying to adapt to a fast-changing national dialogue on police and race as the Black Lives Matter movement gains worldwide prominence.
""This is an issue whose time has come,"" Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., the GOP's only black senator, said Thursday on the ""Today"" show.
A group of GOP senators led by Scott is meeting behind closed doors and with the White House on the legislation. Despite a push to produce a package this week, the deadline is slipping as details are being compiled. It is expected to be released early next week, according to a senior GOP aide unauthorized to discuss the situation and granted anonymity.
Central to the package will be a new national database of use-of-force incidents, similar to one included in the Democratic bill. It's a concept both parties support as a way to track potential police misconduct and ensure officers cannot simply transfer from one department to another without public disclosure of their records.
Scott said the provision would be named the ""Breonna Taylor Reporting Act"" and it would include not only the tracking of use-of-force incidents but also no-knock warrants such as police used to enter the 26-year-old woman's home. The database proposal expands on a similar bill Scott introduced in 2015 after Walter Scott - no relation - was killed by police in South Carolina.
Unlike the House Democratic bill, which would ban police choke holds, the Republican bill appears to be more focused on providing training for officers to de-escalate confrontations.
It would also include ""duty to intervene"" provisions so other officers would step up to stop misconduct, Scott said.
""We're trying to provide the resources necessary to retrain these local departments,"" he said.

""Crickets"" is how Hannah Stoudemire, cofounder and chief executive officer of Fashion for All Foundation, described the reserve she witnessed from the fashion industry in speaking out after a series of black killings, including Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, in July 2016.
As with Floyd, these men were unarmed and killed by police officers - with each incident captured on camera.
""The fashion industry is so visible and influential and powerful - it is your human duty to speak out against these atrocities against the black community and in America today,"" said Stoudemire.
Stoudemire, then a Lanvin employee and the only black person and woman on the Madison Avenue men's selling floor, was fed up with the silence she witnessed from her colleagues and fellow fashion industry when it came to the Black Lives Matter movement. Especially when just a month prior, shootings in Orlando and Paris received what Stoudemire considered proper ""acknowledgment"" from the industry.
She and cofounder Ali Richmond formally launched Fashion for All Foundation following a Black Lives Matter demonstration Stoudemire organized outside of Skylight Clarkson Square at New York Fashion Week: Men's in 2016, a time ""when it wasn't safe to be 'political,""' as Stoudemire reiterated.
Even as recently as 2017, ties were cut for similar political discourse when L'Oréal Paris ended its contract with its first black transgender model, Munroe Bergdorf.
Reflected on the series of disturbances leading up to her organization's founding, Stoudemire asked: ""Why didn't these brands speak up four years ago?""
In spite of gritting her teeth and challenging brands and companies on their missteps, Stoudemire emphasizes the power of social media as a platform, launching the ""Breaking the Silence"" campaign under FFAF last weekend, on May 30.

The campaign confronts brands and companies to speak up on human injustices and ""stand in solidarity with us as we urge the fashion industry, major fashion brands, fashion publications, fashion media and fashion influencers to break their silence on racial injustice, anti-black hate crimes and the brutal killing of black people,"" ending with a plea to condemn racism, murder and stop the ""eerily ironic"" silence.
Having worked with the Council of Fashion Designers of America, brands like Tommy Hilfiger and Dapper Dan, among others, through the work of FFAF, Stoudemire emphasized: ""We are always looking to educate and help build these campaigns and build that place so that it is authentic. We understand that [companies and brands] have to unlearn racist actions and unlearn racism because it is built into the very systems of which they run, operate and make money off of. We understand that.""
It becomes disingenuous when companies and brands are ""unwilling to do the work,"" as she added, and can be painfully obvious to consumers.
If only speaking in terms of profit, fashion companies and brands cannot afford to stay silent on matters of racial injustice, as women of color have a buying power of $1 trillion, with more than $361 billion in revenue generated each year from businesses owned by women of color, according to a 2018 study from the Network of Executive Women. The study surveyed more than 3,600 network members and U.S. employees in retail and consumer goods across ethnic and racial groups.
Whether it's human rights infringements of the mostly black and brown female garment workforce down the value chain, misappropriation of black culture in fashion designs, discriminatory hiring practices or less inclusive workplace culture barring advancement - the fashion system has a stake in this conversation whether it wants to or not.
In a 2017 CFDA study with FWD.us that included more than 160 industry professionals, 85 percent of the participants indicated that ""foreign talent is important to the growth and success of their businesses.""
Yet, as indicated in that same report by Network of Executive Women, retention is another story entirely. For example, women of color reported less optimism for career advancement, with studies revealing declining opportunities for advancement into roles at the manager, senior manager and executive level over the next 10 years, despite being projected to comprise a majority of women by 2060.
FFAF is one of many organizations using Instagram as a vehicle for change, accountability and direct engagement with the fashion community.
Exposing the initial hypocrisy of brands overzealous in sharing climate-related sustainability news, yet going quiet or coming up short in solidarity for human injustices, Stoudemire said: ""Racism is a sustainability issue; it cuts down on life expectancy. You can't be sustainable and not be anti-racist."" True, the U.N. sustainable development goals cited by many in their sustainability reports cover global challenges, including verbatim - inequality and justice.
Luckily, Stoudemire has said the sustainable brands are mostly accountable and engaged.
As for those brands that engaged directly with the campaign, they included Gabriela Hearst, Phillip Lim and Prabal Gurung, to name a few. When asked, Hearst shared FFAF's campaign ""within minutes.""
""I just DM'd her and said, 'you know we really appreciate you standing with us and posting more than a statement. People want to hear more than that, they want to hear it in your own words and know that you really feel this way,'"" reiterated Stoudemire.
Many more social media campaigns have erupted since, including Brother Vellies designer Aurora James' #15PercentPledge, calling on corporations like Walmart Inc., Whole Foods Inc. and Target Corp. to commit to buying 15 percent of products from black-owned businesses; #AmplifyMelanatedVoicesChallenge, urging social media users to amplify the social justice work and content of BIPOC (black, indigenous and people of color), and #BlackoutTuesday, which shares a similar intention to the former in re-centering the conversation.
On Tuesday, many more black squares appeared by brands, companies and consumers.
""Black lives are worth more than a black square. Use that space responsibly, you do more than that to sell lipstick,"" said Stoudemire, but at the very least being human is a start.

As thousands of protesters clash with riot police and the National Guard in the US in the wake of George Floyd's asphyxiation after policeman Derek Chauvin kept his foot on his neck for more than eight minutes in Minneapolis on May 25th, we must face the reality that the American Civil War is not over.
America has not made its peace with its history of slavery. America has not made its peace with black skin.
For those who believe in their hearts, not just their heads, that ""Black Lives Matter"" every bit as much as lives of any other hue, the video of George Floyd's killing and his last words, ""I can't breathe"", bespeak a horror which goes beyond this particular outrage.
We know somewhere in us that countless thousands of black men, women and children have been trampled to death under the boots of people like us.
Watching the video - if you can - scratches a very old guilt. Millions of slaves were trafficked from Africa to the US, the UK, the Caribbean, the Arabian peninsula and elsewhere in a trade which lasted over 400 years.
The writer Mary Russell has found evidence of a black, four-year-old boy being trafficked into Cork Harbour during her research into the Munster butter trade.
Neither the black world nor the white world has done more than partially recover from this horror. Though it's likely that many genuinely believed that black slaves were not as fully human as they were themselves, I think it's likely many knew they were, and hid the emotion.
Servants of all kinds were badly treated but the difference made by black skin was that our common humanity could be completely overlooked. People with black skin became the victims of our most extreme passions, whether sexual, violent, emotional or all three.
It's clear that when Abraham Lincoln won the American Civil War in 1865 many on the Confederate side did not accept the victory, It's clear their descendants are still fighting.
The African-American is several generations away from slavery, the white American is several generations away from the Confederates, and yet the black man must still be the whipping boy for loss of any kind.
The extinguishing of black lives by the white ""justice"" system in the US is in fact routine. In 2017 Blacks made up a third of the US prison population, while comprising 12.6 percent of the general population. Their imprisonment rate is six times that of whites.
Well yes, they are poorer and poverty is a background factor in some criminality. Of course the relative deprivation of blacks in the US underlies all of this.
This is the reason that Blacks are facing a death rate from Covid 19 which is four times that of whites. Given the kind of death which the disease can inflict on its victims, George Floyd's last words, ""I can't breathe"" tell the tale of countless other black people who have died in recent weeks.
But African-Americans don't just face poverty and high rates of imprisonment. They comprise about 34 percent of all the prisoners legally murdered by the State for their alleged crimes since 1976 in the 38 states which permit capital punishment.
The crimes deemed ""capital"", almost always involved white victims: 80 percent of them, according to independent research carried out in 1990. Nearly all of the prosecutors involved in these cases are white.
In the words of the American Civil Liberties Union, """"A systematic racial bias in the application of the death penalty exists at both the State and Federal level."" They are calling for a ""moratorium"" on the death penalty to address this ""miscarriage of justice"". Maybe abolishing racial bias would in effect abolish the death penalty.
[readmore]1003158[/readmore]
Frank Baumgarten, the author of a study of race and the death penalty called Deadly Justice, describes capital punishment in the US as ""an ugly symbol of racial hierarchy designed to preserve the southern way of life."" It was the Republican Abraham Lincoln who won the war which finally abolished slavery in the US but today the Republicans frequently line up on the other side, making political footballs of black lives, particularly in the South.
Under North Carolina's Democratic-led Racial Justice Act (2009) the death penalties of three black men and a Native American woman were commuted because it was found that the juries had been ""bleached"": black potential jury members had been rejected at about four times the rate that white jury members had been rejected, so that the juries all had strong white majorities.
In one case the prosecution had described a possible black jury member as a ""thug"".
In another, the all-white jury which remained after the ""bleaching"" agreed to send to his death a man described by the prosecution as ""a big black bull."" The new Republican administration repealed the Racial Justice Act in 2013 and in 2017 the court ruled that the overturning of the death penalties based on that law should be reversed. The battle for those four lives is again going through the North Carolina courts.
The vision of President Trump holding his Bible up like a Crusader after protesters were cleared with tear gas in Washington DC on Monday shows his utter betrayal of Lincoln's legacy.
But the Trump circus must not blind us in Ireland to our own significant racism towards the sub-Saharan Africans in our midst. We too inherit the history of slavery. If you doubt that, check out the O'Haras of Tara in Gone with the Wind on Netflix.
I resented the anti-black bias of my mother, who grew up in rural Donegal and never had a single Black acquaintance, but I don't think it was fully rooted out of me until I visited sub-Saharan Africa for the first time early this year and was welcomed as a white guest in a black country.
Not many people have that opportunity. It is vital, half way through the International Decade of People of African Descent, that Ireland attacks afro-phobic racism with root-and-branch reform of education to include the African experience.
Africans in Ireland experience more racist incidents than any other group. As Irish Network Against Racism reports, these include political hate speech, racist crimes, racist violence, intimidation, racist bullying, discriminatory treatment in housing, education and service provision and lack of access to healthcare and employment.
Crucially, reports INAR, the responses of the gardaí have been considered inadequate in two out of three cases. Many Africans don't think it's even worth reporting racist incidents and there have been allegations of racist harrassment by gardaí.
We urgently need Hate Crime legislation, such as is on the books of in a majority of OECD countries, accompanied by intense anti-racism training for gardaí and perhaps positive discrimination to ""unbleach"" the force.
We may see ourselves as ""The blacks of Europe"", to quote from Roddy Doyle's The Commitments, but we too could have crushed George Floyd. Only by recognising that fact will we get the kind of aggressive reform which would make it impossible.

He adds that President Donald Trump is a ""catastrophe,"" which helped increase hate crimes and seeks to deflect the linchpin of claims by ""drawing attention to looters and people in insurrection, people immediately forget about injustices against blacks.""
-Is there more racist police violence now or is it more visible with the videos?
-There was always police violence. We have two problems in America. One is police abuse in general against the working class and particularly against males. The second is that the chance of dying in the hands of the police if you're black and male is 13 times higher than if you're white. This is very serious because it's not a thing a year or two ago, it's a 400-year-old historyproblem. For all these years black men have been exposed to police violence. There are many cases and in all of them the policemen have been exempted. The Courts have consistently been in favor of the police.
""We have a catastrophe in the United States called Donald Trump""
Patricia Fernandez KellyProfessor of Sociology and Director of Princeton University
-Barack Obama said this shouldn't be normal in the United States in 2020 Why is it still normal?
-It's not just normal. We have a catastrophe in the United States called Donald Trump. This individual has created a context in which it is much more likely to be black and die at the hands of the police. What has happened in the United States at this stage is that what are called hate crimes, i.e. crimes motivated by prejudice against Jews, Muslims, homosexuals, etc. have grown. This individual is not heartbroken to agitate the masses who, out of ignorance, and also by other causes linked to their economic marginalization, are willing to kill people and shift the tone against the weak. I belong to a black church and know the level of pain and anxiety of mothers that when every day they let their children out on the street they don't know if they're going to see them again. George Floyd's case sucks. It's 8 minutes with his knee around his neck, when he screams he can't breathe and it's a case very similar to that of Erick Gardner in New York in 2014.
-Trump called those who protested violently ""thugs,"" and even suggested that looters deserved to be shot. Did these words increase outrage?
-When you look at the global history of black people in the United States, it has always been a desperate cry for being included as part of society. But this story also demonstrates how easy it is to agitate people simply by drawing attention to riots, which are actually social unrest caused by the inability to be heard. When we have been around for years, generations, in which these situations continue to exist, excluded groups go to the streets to burn buildings because it is the last of the alternatives they have for them to be heard. Is it counterproductive? Yes, it is. Because these are situations that could have been avoided, even today, throughof a fair justice system, that allows people of color to feel part of, to feel included in society. This is deeply debilitating, you don't know what hurts me.
""Trump has no scruples, he's a monster. He's someone who takes every opportunity to capitalize on them. He's an opportunist.
Patricia Fernandez KellyProfessor of Sociology and Director of Princeton University
-Do you then think Trump seeks to deflect the linchpin from grievances?
-Exactly, drawing attention to looters and people who are insurrection, immediately people forget the injustices against blacks. Of course, looters can always be blamed, but why don't we put the spotlight on the justice system that exists with respect to the working class or the black marginalized class? Trump has no scruples, he's a monster. He's someone who takes every opportunity to capitalize on them. He's an opportunist.
-Could the serious economic situation, with the coronavirus pandemic and rising unemployment, have cried out the outbursts?
Surely, and that brings us to another kind of consideration. The president has support that has not fluctuated. The pandemic, the unemployment, the economy has not affected the people who support Trump,who remains unchanged. It has between 40% and 45% of voters. So, if you were in that situation, what would be the immoral but effective strategy to get the most votes? A Trump strategy is to agitate people against migrants and now against minorities. This is a great opportunity for him. The second is to provoke an international altercation that we are already seeing with the case of China. By the November elections we will see a great turmoil against immigrants, refugees and blacks. It's a tragic thing because the groups that are more likely to support Trump are just working-class groups, with low levels of schooling. Of course there are people who do not meet these characteristics, but the largest contingent are low-education people and very hit by deindstriization in the United States. Trump's base is the big victims of advanced capitalism and the fall of the industrial base in the United States, people who have been excluded by relocating businesses to elsewhere.
-In Minnesota and in the industrial belt there is a lot of observed this phenomenon.
Of course. One has compassion for those who have suffered so much for the decisions made by corporations, but these people are constantly mobilizing and mobilizing against other groups. In reality, one could imagine a world in which these excluded would stand in solidarity with workers, including migrants and blacks. But that's not what happened. We have experienced several catastrophes here in the United States in recent years, the last is the pandemic. But we're now four years of this political catastrophe called Donald Trump.

 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE / January 2002 Scurfield / SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, TERRORIST ACTS COMMENTARY ABOUT THE TERRORIST ACTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 Posttraumatic Reactions and Related Social and Policy Issues RAYMOND MONSOUR SCURFIELD University of Southern MississippiGulf Coast Like many people in the United States and internationally, the author was pro- foundly affected by the terrorist attacks on September 11th and the massive deaths in New York City, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania. The unprecedented numbers of innocents murdered and the massive media coverage combined to form an extraordinarily indelible imprint on hundreds of millions of people worldwide. The objectives of this commentary are to identify (a) the range of normal and expectable reactions to the acts that have been and are being experienced by mil- lions of Americans--and especially those who were distant from the trauma sites, and (b) the relationship between people's personal reactions to the acts and several related social and national policy issues and choices Americans are facing. The au- thor offers this from his perspectives as a proud third-generation Syrian American, Vietnam veteran, social worker, and someone with a long-standing involvement in the field of post-traumatic stress disorder. Key words: PTSD, trauma, terrorism, September 11, World Trade Center MY IMMEDIATE REACTIONS after the initial reports of the terrorist acts of September 11th were reflective of my survival reactions in the face of numerous traumatic events that have oc- curred since my return fromthe VietnamWar. These have included the Persian Gulf War, a massive wildfire that surrounded our home in Topanga Canyon outside of Los Angeles, the devastating Hurricane Iniki in Hawaii, and sev- eral hurricanes on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. During all such traumatic events, I have en- gaged in perhaps the most common survival mode in the face of trauma: denial, tunnel vi- sion, and task-focus (Scurfield, 1993a). Throughout September 11th, I remained se- questered in my university office, focusing on concrete tasks to complete a long-overdue ""loaner copy"" of an extensive bibliography of readings for one of my master of social work courses. Simultaneously, I kept one ear attuned to conversations in the hallway. Many war-zone veterans have described similar reactions-- after all, it's what we did to survive in war. The enormity of the event did not begin to sink in until late that afternoon as I got into my car and turned on the radio. I knew then that I 3 AUTHOR'S NOTE: I amindebted to the 63 MSW students, School of Social Work, University of Southern Mississippi, in my SWK courses no. 642 (Field Seminar) and no. 653 (Individual and Family Assessment) for their sharing of our class discussions that contributed to this writing. And blessings on the more than 4,500 people killed and on the wounded, their families and friends, and all who have been victim- ized by the horrific acts of September 11th and global terrorism. TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE, Vol. 3, No. 1, January 2002 3-14 2002 Sage Publications had to start off that evening's field seminar class with a discussion of the day's events and their impact. Following our initial class discussion, over the next two months I wrote and rewrote this commentary numerous times. Not only was I staying task-focused, but this writing also was a way for me to express some of my angst at the horrific events of September 11th--similar to a commentary that I had felt compelled to com- plete in the throes of the pending Persian Gulf War (Scurfield, 1992). NORMAL AND EXPECTABLE REACTIONS, VERSUS PSYCHIATRICALLY DISORDERED REACTIONS, TO TRAUMA The topical areas described in this commen- tary illustrate the range of normal and expectable reactions (Weaver, 1995), dynamics, and issues that are descriptive of what has been happening to so many of us who have been ""distant"" witnesses and observers of the terror- ist acts and were not necessarily personally or directly exposed firsthand to the trauma. ""Dis- tant,"" of course, is a relative termwhen consid- ering how modern technology (television and cell phones, in particular) has vividly, inti- mately, and repeatedly brought the horror of the terrorist acts directly into the immediacy of our living rooms and lives. We weren't there, and still so many of us were dramatically affected by the events and massive media coverage. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Volume IV, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) diagnostic classifications of acute stress and post-traumatic disorders affirm that people can be markedly affected by wit- nessing a trauma or through the ""indirect"" im- pact of a trauma happening to others (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). However, strong criticismalso has been raised that such post- traumatic diagnostic criteria contribute to pathologizing what are within a normal and expectable range of reactions to trauma (Kutchins & Kirk, 1997). The massive and national impact of these horrific terrorist acts adds yet a further chal- lenge to a valid differentiation between normal and expectable responses versus those that are disordered. I contend that the almost unprece- dented nature, severity, and wide-ranging impact of these terrorist acts must challenge our usual thinking about normal and expectable re- actions to trauma to include (a) elongation of the length of time that such typical reactions as de- scribed next can be expected to continue and (b) broadening the extent of the expectable impact on functioning. TYPICAL REACTIONS AND DYNAMICS IN RESPONSE TO THE TERRORIST ACTS That the following categories of postterrorist reactions are within a broad range of what is normal and expectable is of no small signifi- cance in that these reactions are characteristic of tens of millions of us. We must be able to recog- nize, understand, and address our reactions if we are to properly heal fromthe tragedies as in- dividuals, as groups, as communities, as a nation. Being immersed in the media coverage. For many of us, at least the first several days if not initial weeks during and after September 11th were characterized by our being glued to television, radio, and/or newspaper coverage. We could not get enough (or was it that we'd had enough but did not seemable or willing to cease and de- sist?): watching about it, reading about it, talk- ing about it, thinking about it, dwelling on it, day and night. And, many did so to the point at which there was a temporary but significant change in our daily routines and/or interfer- ence in our daily life functioning. And this should only be considered as abnormal if we let ourselves become addicted to an immersion in coverage by the media over a sustained period of time and to the point at which it has contin- ued to interfere significantly with our lives. Avoidance, denial, and detachment. Another substantial proportion of the population avoided or ignored the media coverage, did not talk much about it, and so forth. This may reflect the following: Why are people spending so much time just thinking and talking about this and watching the seemingly endless television commentary and pictures about 4 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE / January 2002 this? After a point, what good does it do? Life has to go on, you know. Indeed, there are a number of persons who seem to have been going on with their lives as if noth- ing out of the ordinary has happened. For some, this indicates an extreme self-centeredness, an attitude of simply not caring that some 5,000 people perished in a few hours. And there are more of such people than most of us would like to admit. On the other hand, there are at least two other groups of persons who have been in states of denial, avoidance, and detachment about the trauma, but for very different reasons. Many have avoided and denied the full horror of the terrorist events as a way to engage in tun- nel vision in order to remain functional; others have been in a state of denial to prevent an exac- erbation of their own unresolved memories and issues fromprevious past personal traumas. These two groups are described separately. Tunnel vision and task-oriented. A functional formof avoidance and denial includes tunnel vision and task-focus. There is purposefulness in moving ahead with daily tasks. There is a de- tachment from feelings and an intentional focus on staying busy. Indeed, some persons have purposefully gone out of their way to try to find things to do to stay busy--""just to do some- thing."" Persons who engage in tunnel vision and remain task-oriented as a way to avoid po- tentially overwhelming emotions and remain functional do have significant feelings and reac- tions to the terrorist acts and aftermath. It's just that they have been choosing not to allow such reactions to flood their thinking and feeling in order to remain functional and not be over- whelmed by very strong emotions (Hammond, Scurfield, & Risse, 1993; Scurfield, 2001b). On the other hand, such attitudes and behaviors may continue at a marked level and for too long a period of time. This can result in an unhealthy avoidance of (or ever getting around to) dealing in a timely or constructive manner with ex- tremely important feelings, reactions, and is- sues that have been caused or triggered by the terrorist acts and their aftermath. Triggering memories and pain from previous trauma. Many who have suffered trauma and loss in the past have had a resurgence in the present of painful feelings and memories about such prior events. For example, similar to the re- actions in the midst of our nation's preparations for the Persian Gulf War (Scurfield, 1992), many combat veterans of different wars have had old psychological wounds and grief over killing and loss torn open once again. In addition, a number of veterans are having strong negative reactions to the honorific label ""hero"" being thrown around rather liberally; that is, that just wearing a particular uniformdoes not equate to being a hero. Also, the families of those killed and maimed in the Oklahoma City bomb- ing or in other larger scale disasters and those who have suffered personal traumatic loss, such as the murder or disappearance of a loved one, are also very likely to have been impacted and have the hurt fromold traumas reopened or exacerbated. It is important to note that such triggering or exacerbation of previous trauma experience and loss can (a) totally or partially eclipse for a period of time a person's having valid posttrauma reactions to the present-day trauma of the terrorist attacks, (b) plunge a person into a series of alternating feelings and intrusive thoughts, going back and forth between the past trauma and the terrorist attacks, or (c) impel a convergence or commingling of feelings and in- trusive thoughts fromboth the past and current trauma (such as in dreams). Such a resurgence can be quite terrifying and impel the person to think that he or she is being very inappropriate or is going crazy. This is not so, nor does it mean that such persons are not sorely impacted by the terrorist events of September 11. It simply means that the person's prior traumatic history has resurfaced as an intrusive presence. Two illustrations of this powerful dynamic in which current and past trauma seem to collide or converge occurred when I was cocoordinating the deployment of Veterans Administration mental health disaster relief teams on the island of Kauai in 1992 following the devastation of Hurricane Iniki (Scurfield et al., 1993). We saw one woman who had escaped years earlier from a cult in California and had fled to seek sanctu- ary on Kauai. In the midst of Hurricane Iniki, she was having intensely intrusive traumatic Scurfield / SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, TERRORIST ACTS 5 reexperiencing of her cult experiences and was not reacting to Hurricane Iniki. A second person was having intrusive flashbacks more to his traumatic experiences during a previous hurri- cane that had struck 10 years earlier than to Hurricane Iniki. Such reactions are due to (a) the commonality of terror, grief, rage, and blame that are intrinsic to various trauma experiences (Scurfield, 1993a); and (b) the tendency to mar- shal one's psychological defenses against the current trauma--making it more likely for prior trauma issues to be provoked. This dynamic is particularly critical to recognize because we can well expect that there will be yet additional ter- rorist acts in the future. The good news is that exacerbation of old traumatic wounds provides an opportunity to further think about, talk about, process, and heal yet a little more from prior trauma. And this is more likely to happen if such persons are educated about the normalcy of this dynamic. The bad news is that the person may well face, concurrently or sometime later, an emergence or resurgence of (delayed) reactions to the ter- rorist acts. This, too, is important to educate sur- vivors about. Inappropriate reactions and behaviors. Unfortu- nately, trauma not only brings out the best in many people, it also brings out the worst in some. There were very disturbing reports of low-life looters underground at the World Trade Center while rescuers were frenetically providing emergency services above ground. Also, gas stations in numerous states dramati- cally raised their gas prices on September 11th, to as high as $4 a gallon (Tortorana, 2001). This was a grossly inappropriate act to achieve a quick financial gain fromthe fear reactions to this national trauma. And there have been those who have ridiculed, made crass jokes about, or otherwise demeaned what happened. The latter could be reflective of quite different underlying attitudes. One may simply not care, which, of course, is grossly inappropriate. Or, joking might be an attempt to deflect from the serious- ness of the tragedy; in other words, a formof avoidance and denial of the horrific nature of what happened. This is not an unusual reaction among survivors of protracted or massive trauma (Scurfield, 2001b). It is hoped that such persons will be appropriately confronted about inappropriate behaviors. On the other hand, to once again enjoy life and appropriate humor are important to be able to give a perspective to problems and to help the healing process (Schiraldi, 2000). Following the terrorist acts, an initial celebra- tory reaction by some Palestinians was reported in the media. Although not celebratory, a strong feeling was tapped among some Palestinians. The Americans are responsible for everything. . . . I amagainst killing of innocent civilians, but the Americans are bad. . . . The Jews are assassinating, destroying, and wounding Palestinians every day. . . . Let them[the Americans] feel the suffering, the suffering we have been feeling for a long time. (Kalman, 2001) There have been Americans, too (and, no, not only of Middle East backgrounds) who have stated that they can see where a number of peo- ple internationally have little sympathy for those Americans killed and maimed ""because America had it coming"" for political, economic, or other reasons. Almost all Americans and many people internationally almost surely would consider such comments to be com- pletely inappropriate; and yet, some vehe- mently agree with such statements. Becoming hyperreactive. In the aftermath of September 11th, people are naturally extremely sensitive and hyperreactive to others: irritabil- ity, exhaustion, difficulties concentrating, being easily distracted or emotionally labile, having one's emotional buttons more easily pushed by people and events that otherwise are not reflec- tive of one's reactions before the terrorist acts. As a personal illustration, especially during the first three weeks after September 11th, I became quite angry (internally) when hearing or ob- serving others seeming to have a good time: How can people sit here at work (school), laughing and joking and talking about routine matters, when thousands of people have just been killed and maimed! Of course, it is easy to react very strongly to others when fueled by the thought and feeling 6 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE / January 2002 that ""everything else pales in comparison, doesn't it?"" In addition, it can be very easy for poorly worded or ill-timed communications to arouse very strong emotional reactions. For example, one student in one of my social work classes started off by making the following statement: This was a tragedy. However, I amnot sad that this has happened to Americans any more than to people in any other country. A number of the students, including myself, did not remember the first statement--but surely did hone in on the second one; in turn, this made it difficult to really hear anything else that this student said. Consequently, a number of the stu- dents who were already in a very sensitive and emotional state reacted with considerable negativity toward this student--both in class and afterward. In addition, another student whose spouse is on active military duty, said, My husband would give his life to defend your right to be able to express your opinion as you have done, as much as he or I would strongly disagree with what you have said. (MSW student, personal com- munication, September 13, 2001) Of course, all of us have the right to have our opinions, to voice them, and to not be subjected to reprisals for such expressions. However, we also have a personal responsibility as to the tim- ing and/or choice of wording of such expres- sions that can exacerbate volatile reactions to something so horrific as the acts of September 11th. There is one final point about attitudes and behaviors that are or seeminappropriate, not particularly admirable, or even despicable to others. These, too, are reflective of the normal and expectable range of posttrauma reactions. And then there were the debates and seem- ingly agonizing (!) decisions made regarding whether various sporting events such as foot- ball, baseball, golf, and NASCAR should be can- celed or not. Was it demeaning to those killed and maimed, and to their families and friends, that the professional and college football and baseball programs had to actually debate whether to cancel the week's games or not and for so many fans who seemed to be more con- cerned about going to such games rather than being with their families, personally reflecting or going to worship together and praying for or honoring the victims and their families? Or, on the other hand, is not returning to normal activi- ties a necessary component of the posttrauma healing process? Getting back to everyday routines . Very helpful to posttrauma recovery is returning to an estab- lished routine relatively quickly (Mitchell & Everly, 1994; National Association of Social Workers, 1992; Scurfield, 2002; Weaver, 1995): Hey, you can't dwell on this forever; you've got to move on. There's no harmin getting away fromit for a while; and it might help alleviate some of the pain a little. I'll be damned if I'm going to let these terrorists ""win"" by bringing our country to a standstill. I'mgo- ing to do what I usually do, terrorist threat or no ter- rorist threat. The balancing and timing can be tenuous be- tween grieving and reflection versus when it is not just helpful but necessary to ""move on with one's life."" Many of us have been struggling to attain that right balance and timing between these two seemingly competing necessities. Strong reactions that are somewhat disruptive. Many of us have been having certain types of re- actions and feelings that were and may continue to be somewhat disruptive to our normal func- tioning--and are normal and expectable. For many, there has been a preoccupation not only with what did happen but also with fear about what might happen, a shattering of one's assumptions about what to ex- pect in everyday life; preoccupation with environmental dangers, and as- sociated anxiety, fear, and isolation; and/or loss of both a personal and a national ""sense of safety."" Another common set of reactions has been very emotional: breaking down and crying, dif- ficulty going to or staying asleep, irritability, temper outbursts, mood swings and surges of depression, grief or rage, nausea or body aches, and marked appetite changes. Survivor guilt has also been a problemfor some, although typ- Scurfield / SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, TERRORIST ACTS 7 ically much more so for persons who were di- rectly connected with the dead and missing (i.e., ""Why did I make ______ catch the earliest possi- ble flight back from Boston?""). And, others have experienced feeling very helpless or pessimistic (""How can you possibly stop more terrorist acts like this from happen- ing?"") and/or extremely frustrated (""I have all these heavy feelings, but no where to put them and no one to take them out on""). The immorality of the terrorist acts. The vast ma- jority of people have had an abhorrent reaction to the catastrophic nature of the terrorist acts-- acts that in a few hours incurred close to 10% of the number of deaths of U.S. personnel during the 10 years of the Vietnam War, i.e., This was an extremely immoral act. How could any- one perpetrate such horror onto other innocent hu- man beings! The vast majority of people worldwide, and rightly so, appear to have rejected any reason as justification for the horrific acts that were perpe- trated. Even so, many people in other countries perceive Americans to have been living in a world of denial or of minimizing the atrocities taking place internationally, a number of which the United States is accused of having abetted. (This is discussed in the last section of this arti- cle regarding the root causes of terrorism.) Another perspective has been offered by a number of Israelis, who have expressed horror at and sympathy for what happened. They also have noted that the magnitude and nature of this trauma will probably give many Americans a much better understanding of the terrorist acts and threats that Israel has been facing for many years, and the extremely difficult decisions that must be made. For example, what retaliatory re- sponses (i.e., rocketing or bulldozing the homes of an entire neighborhood of suspected terror- ists and sympathizers) and proactive responses (i.e., targeted assassinations of suspected terror- ists) are appropriate and necessary--versus morally questionable or immoral, yet another in the seemingly endless and vicious cycle of retri- bution? Indeed, are the increasingly hard-line military strikes that Israel is carrying out neces- sary in order to be saved fromannihilation, and the repeated and deadly suicide bombings that Arabs are carrying out necessary in order to fight for their Palestinian homeland--or are both leading toward a Middle East apocalypse? In a similar vein, a number of Americans, as well as citizens of other countries, have stated that September 11th ended a period of inno- cence and navet for the United States. American joined the world today. We've been living in Disneyland so long. (Cauchon & O'Driscoll, 2001) And, let's face it: Traditional rules of war do not apply in the face of an overwhelming enemy military force. America recognized this during our fight for independence more than two cen- turies ago. It would have been stupidity for American forces to engage the British in forma- tions of rank on rank of soldiers marching in open fields of battle toward each other. In such circumstances, as terrorists obviously believe they are in, traditional warfare is not a realistic option. Instead, terrorismor guerilla tactics are used against any targets of opportunity to inflict terror, disruption, and ultimately to destroy the will and commitment to fight. This means that women, children, the elderly--all innocent ci- vilians, as well as military targets, are fair game (Ayalon, 1993). And, of course, those described as ""faceless cowards"" or ""vilified terrorists"" by one side in- evitably are revered as ""heroic resistance fight- ers"" or ""martyrs"" by the other (Scurfield, 1992). Increased Racism and Xenophobia Versus Humanitarianism and Other Enhancements In the aftermath of the terrorist carnage, peo- ple's reactions can easily be consumed with fear, hatred, and acts of revenge. And, as inevitably happens during times of war, racist stereotyp- ing rears its ugly head, xenophobic reactions can arise and there will be a dehumanizing of the alleged perpetrators and their supporters. Indeed, as of September 17th, the FBI had opened 40 hate-crime investigations into re- ported attacks on Arab Americans, including two killings apparently provoked by anti-Arab sentiments (Sobieraj, 2001). 8 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE / January 2002 On the other hand, in the aftermath of such inhumane acts can arise the most noble and hu- manitarian of virtues and behavior: staunchly defending Arab Americans and Muslims; courage, strength, selflessness, heroism; large-scale donations of blood, services, goods, money, and increased voluntarism; and firefighters and police running up the stairs in the Twin Towers--while the building's occupants were running down. How could one not have a markedly en- hanced appreciation for public servants who we tend to take for granted (i.e., fire protection, law enforcement, civilian and military emergency medical and rescue personnel, charitable, civic, religious and relief organizations, and active duty and reserve military and National Guard)? One of the most emotional ceremonies I have participated in took place at the special noon Mass at our local Catholic Church, St. Thomas, on September 14: What is usually a time during the Mass when a fam- ily brings up offerings, surprisingly turned out to be a procession. The mayor of our small community, along with some 25 fire and law enforcement per- sonnel, walked up to the altar. A spontaneous, sus- tained, and very emotional standing ovation ensued in the packed church. And I know that many poignant and highly emotional scenes unfolded at places of worship of many different religions, sporting venues, and in other secular gatherings throughout our nation and indeed worldwide. For example, many churches sang or played music of songs such as ""America,"" ""God Bless America"" and ""God Bless the U.S.A."" In the words of one con- gregation member at such a service the evening of September 11th during which ""God Bless America"" was sung, I've sung that song a lot, but I think that's the first time I understood the true spirit. (Straziuso, 2001) Also, many citizens of all walks of life experi- enced and expressed a renewed sense of pride in the responses of our community and in our na- tion. For some, there was the identification and pride in being an American that had not existed before. One college senior, who was at a cere- mony with about 7,000 fans in lieu of the sched- uled Louisville-Illinois football game, said, I cried because for the first time I understood what it is to be an American. (Associated Press, 2001) Many have described an enhanced apprecia- tion of our cherished freedoms, a reaffirming of what is important in our lives (i.e., family, friends, community, faith), and perhaps most heartening of all: a crystallization of unprece- dented support, cooperation, solidarity, and love between people in many cities throughout the United States and in many countries internationally. The above developments reflect the fact that during the recovery fromtrauma, it is essential for survivors to be able to recognize and appre- ciate that there is almost always a ""positive"" side of what may be perceived as an entirely negative experience (see Ayalon, 1993; Lyons, 1991; Schiraldi, 2000; Scurfield, 1985, 1993b, 1994, 2001a, 2001b, 2002; Scurfield & Mackey, 2001). For example, survivors must be facili- tated to not only address the understandable agony and resentment of the carnage caused by the terrorists; also, there is the profound appre- ciation of freedomand the strength to persevere despite catastrophic loss and pain (Scurfield, 1993b, 1994; Wiest, Root, & Scurfield, 2001). And, there is modest research evidence that trauma cannot only be overcome but that it can have positive effects on one's life (Tadeschi & Calhoun, 1996). Feeling cursed or blessed . Frequently, in the face of trauma, there is an impact on one's faith and belief in a higher power or God. Exposure to trauma can severely challenge or shatter one's beliefs and may require spiritual or pastoral counseling to specifically address such beliefs (Sinclair, 1993). On the other hand, trauma ex- posure can promote a dramatic reaffirmation or flowering of one's faith or spirituality. For ex- ample, many family members whose intimate significant others had been ""miraculously spared"" the tragic consequences of the terrorist acts of September 11th have been quoted or heard to proclaim joyous statements similar to the following: Scurfield / SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, TERRORIST ACTS 9 God must have been looking out for us (or, ""we are blessed"") that my son got out of the tower before it collapsed (or, ""decided to take a different flight,"" or . . .). Such a belief in God's will, divine interven- tion, or presence is remarkably affirming; such spiritual sustenance offers great solace and comfort. On the other hand, what message is communicated and what statements implied when pronouncements of divine intervention are heard by others who were not so fortunate? The latter happened in the aftermath of Hurri- cane Iniki. One surviving family joyfully pro- claimed how God had been looking out for them, in that their home was one of the few on the island that was undamaged. Of course, this was said during a mental health debriefing with many families present whose homes had been destroyed: Hey, so what are you saying, that God punished us, that he was not looking out for our families! This is not to castigate or cast aspersions on the religious or spiritual beliefs of the former group. Rather, it is a caution to request that we think very carefully not about what we believe so much as what, how, and when we communi- cate such beliefs--and the perhaps uninten- tional negative impact that our communica- tions might have on others who have been less fortunate. In the wake of these massive, sense- less, and inhumane acts, perhaps most people of various religious and spiritual beliefs could agree: God must be weeping at what happened. (M. Plaskon, MSW student, personal communication, September 13, 2001) And most people who are agnostic or atheist almost surely agree that these are horrific events that almost all people must be weeping at. It has been uplifting to hear about the dramatic resur- gence in prayer and attendance at places of wor- ship nationwide among many denominations and faiths, a reawakening of spiritual beliefs, voluntarism, and/or enhanced connections among people. Oh, that it will last. COMPETING NATIONAL (AND INTERNA- TIONAL) POLICY ISSUES AND CHOICES The normal responses and reactions of vari- ous individuals impacted by the horrific events of September 11th are directly linked to our be- liefs about and convictions concerning associ- ated policy issues facing our nation and the international community regarding the threat of global terrorism. This happened because we have let our military grow weak. We must have a much bigger and stron- ger military force, no matter the cost. We cannot af- ford to do otherwise. We must curtail many of the procedures and rights regarding wiretaps, due process, arrest, detention. And we must rescind the policy prohibiting the as- sassination of enemies. The likely marked shift in national policies and priorities certainly has a strong rationale in the face of the devastatingly lethal conse- quences of how our freedoms and casual way of life were so grossly violated on September 11th. The resulting decisions will profoundly impact the very fabric of our cherished rights and hu- manitarian egalitarianism that has woven our nation together for more than 200 years. Do we put aside, temporarily, or longer, our cherished freedoms so that global terrorism can be more effectively fought? Can there even be ""rea- soned"" arguments against massive military ex- penditures, regardless of the cost, or will such be labeled as unpatriotic (if not downright political suicide when argued by politicians)? There are the extremely complex issues of when and what is ""enough"" or ""not enough."" Will 200 addi- tional Navy and Coast Guard ships patrolling our coast and waterways 24 hours a day, seven days a week be a sufficient deterrent to terror- ism--or are 800 or more needed? Will 1,000 air- planes patrolling our nation's skies 24 hours a day, seven days a week be sufficient--or ten- fold that number? Where and for how long must we have armed personnel? We must be extremely careful that individual morality and behaviors and support for na- tional policies and issues are not fueled by fear 10 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE / January 2002 or hatred. It happened during World War II (in- ternment not only of Japanese American citi- zens, but also the less publicized internment of a number of Italian- and German-American citi- zens). It happened post-Vietnam(harassment and violence toward Vietnamese immigrants). It happened in the Persian Gulf War; in the words of an American Muslim who wears the traditional garb and head-covering of her reli- gion (Peterson, 2001), On many occasions, when I was stopped at a traffic light, someone would roll down the window and spit at me. They said, ""foreigner go home."" At a local shopping mall, my scarf was pulled off with a secu- rity guard standing right next to me. And it's happening today. As of September 17th, hundreds of incidents of harassment of Muslims, other Middle Easterners, North Afri- cans, and South Asians in the United States have been reported (""Another Kind of War,"" 2001): ""Go back to your own country, you stinking A-rabs and Muslims."" The resulting traumatic impact on Arab Americans, Muslims, and Americans whose an- cestry can be traced to a range of countries from Morocco to Indonesia, has been profound. We have many such immigrants, and Americans who may even be second- or third-generation citizens are living in fear of being discriminated against, or being threatened, assaulted, or killed--simply because of the color of their skin and other identifiable physical features, their Arabic-sounding names, or their religion! Mar- tin Luther King must be looking down and cry- ing; this does not represent his noble dreamor the America that I and many others have gone into harm's way to defend. Hate-filled racist attitudes and behaviors are like a cancer that eats away at our very morality and humanity--and under the excuse of fear or righteous revenge. Such hate-filled personal re- actions, be they explicit racist acts perpetrated against individuals or prevailing denigrative at- titudes and prejudice, can be traumatizing to people who are being scapegoated or incarcer- ated just because of their physical appearance, race, or country of origin (Loo, 1994, 1998; Loo, Fairbank, Scurfield, & King, 1996-99; Loo et al., in press; Marsella, Friedman, Gerrity, & Scurfield, 1996; Scurfield, 2001a, 2001b; Scurfield & Mackey, 2001). And such personal reactions are no small contributor to attitudes about what our country should and should not do in response to terror- ism. Yes, it is easy for many of us to say that ""We want justice, not revenge."" But, once the reac- tive killing starts, how does one draw definitive boundaries between acts of death and destruc- tion that are ""morally justifiable"" versus killing that becomes as heinous and unjustifiable as the initial acts of the terrorists themselves? The Palestinians are partying in the street! I say, ""Bomb those idiots! Wipe them off the map. Enough of this!"" (Cauchon & O'Driscoll, 2001) Dehumanizing and demonizing of the en- emy is what happens in war to justify and to make it possible for decent, law-abiding--and yes, God-fearing--citizens to do what must be done to be able to kill the enemy. During the VietnamWar, military recruits were literally brainwashed with such racist terms as ""gooks,"" ""slopes,"" and ""slant-eyes"" to describe the en- emy forces, and such terms continued as every- day language and thinking in the war zone (Eisenhart, 1974; Loo, 1998; Loo et al., in press; Scurfield, 1993a, 2001a, 2001b; Wiest et al., 2001). And, it happened in the Persian Gulf War; a number of military personnel in the Middle East used disparaging terms such as ""A-rabs"" and ""towel-heads"" to denigrate practically any- one of Middle Eastern heritage or of the Muslim faith (Scurfield, 1992), not to mention non-Arab and non-Muslim Sikhs. Hatred, revenge, and retribution can fuel just about any action against anyone. Indeed, hatred fuels the distinct possibility that many innocent civilians in other countries such as Afghanistan, a number of whom are oppressed by their own government, will be ""necessary but regrettable collateral damage"" as we strike back at the ter- rorists. This has happened before in the name of justice in our war against SaddamHussein. ""Surgically precise air strikes"" were lauded for their accuracy, ""hitting some 80% of their in- Scurfield / SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, TERRORIST ACTS 11 tended targets."" But, what about the untold numbers of civilians killed and injured by the other 20% that were off target (Scurfield, 1992)? I pray that there is not substantial ""regrettable collateral damage"" again, in this war against global terrorism. Furthermore, the above-described difficult and complex issues that we face will require deep sacrifices in many programs and services if we are to be able to afford the costly preven- tive and military undertakings required to com- bat terrorism. And, where are such budgetary sacrifices to come from? Almost surely they will fall disproportionately on various human ser- vices programs, social security, reducing the na- tional debt, and so forth. We must be very vigi- lant about the likely damaging impact of such severe budget cuts that almost surely will exac- erbate the problems of disadvantaged people in our very own country. Indeed, there has been an ironic backlash: In the face of unprecedented giving for surviving family members of the terrorist acts, a number of charitable organizations have experienced dramatic falloff in the normal giving to help the unfortunate. Family survivors of public ser- vants killed or maimed on September 11 cer- tainly are fully deserving of any assistance that they may be provided. In addition, must we not be equally sensitive to the family survivors of our public servants who are killed and maimed in the line of duty every day? (Angel Romero, Gloucester County Director of Veteran's Affairs, New Jersey, personal communication, October 3, 2001.) Is a firefighter killed on September 10th in Flagstaff, Arizona, or on September 12th in Minot, North Dakota, any less deserving of be- ing memorialized, and his or her family any less deserving of substantial financial support? And, along with the untold hundreds of thousands of women suffering under extremist sexist governments abroad (i.e., the Taliban), what about the women victims of domestic vio- lence here in the U.S.? There are varying esti- mates that thousands of women are killed and over a million are injured every year in domestic acts of terror. Is not such recurring violence also deserving of national and local media attention, priority funding, and services? (Patricia Davis, Assistant Professor, School of Social Work, Uni- versity of Southern Mississippi, personal com- munication, October 18, 2001.) On the other hand, has this been a (very) costly wake-up call that was necessary to aug- ment and deploy military, intelligence, eco- nomic, and other resources in ways that will be much more effective? Will we now be spurred as a nation to sustain the longer termchallenges and sacrifices necessary to combat terrorism that have heretofore been avoided by our country? BUT, WHAT ABOUT THE ROOT CAUSES OF TERRORISM? I pray that we do not lose sight of the fact that necessary military (and associated economic, intelligence, and political) strikes directly against terrorists and their supporters are but one of two fronts in the war against global ter- rorism. The two-front strategy was recognized during the VietnamWar. There was the obvious military front: battles waged with guns and other weapons. Also, we knew that we had to ""win the hearts and minds of the Vietnamese people""--for no guerilla force can survive with- out such support. However, we never did win that second front, with disastrous consequences in spite of our massive war on the military front. Is not the same two-front principle equally applicable to a war on global terrorism? Many people agree that there must be some kind of military (and associated intelligence, economic, and political) front, although the decision mak- ing about the precise nature and extent of such will probably be quite contentious. Isn't it also at least as necessary to confront the root causes that nurture global terrorismin the first place? Many anti-American critics internationally see America as a hypocritical and evil land of free- dom, moral decay, and plenty. Yes, in spite of a rich history of generously aiding other coun- tries with our lives and with our money, we also have a long-standing history of supporting des- potic rulers in countries in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and Latin America (see, for example, Harris, 2001). The enemy of our enemy has in- deed been our friend. Thus, many critics contend that the perpetra- tion of immoral acts has been ignored, sup- 12 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE / January 2002 ported, or even caused by one-sided U.S. gov- ernment policies: supporting Israeli Zionism expansion and apartheid against Arabs and Muslims; backing despotic regimes that oppress and persecute many of their citizens; and ignor- ing tragedies such as the massive extermination of an entire culture in Rwanda. Do not abject poverty, economic/ethnic/religious oppres- sion and persecution, and violation of other hu- man rights in such countries provide terrorists with fertile recruiting grounds and supporters? Must not America and the other more prosper- ous countries in the world be willing to also wage a concurrent, sustained, and unprece- dented campaign against this second front? And how are my and your reactions to the ter- rorist acts of September 11th influencing what national policies each of us will vigorously or passively support or oppose--or ignore? IN CLOSING: IS NONVIOLENCE NO LONGER A VIABLE OPTION? Have events and reactions gone so far as to render the nonviolent approach espoused by lu- minaries in our world's history (from Buddha [Siddhartha Gautama], Moses, Jesus Christ, and Muhammad, to Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Lu- ther King, Jr., and Mother Theresa) to be out- moded in the face of global terrorism by fanatics who will go to any length against anybody? A 61-year-old military veteran has offered a breath of clarity and wisdomin a letter to our lo- cal newspaper, although many might consider his message to be completely whimsical. How can we actualize his penetrating points and folksy wisdomthat speak to the second front on terrorism? Why must everything someone does to us be an- swered with more violence? I, for one, am proud to be called a dove. There is nothing to fear fromme. If retaliation is on the people's minds, hit them where it really hurts. Destroy themwith worldly goods. Ran- domly drop everything we can all over their coun- tries. Take away their people's right to fight for some idiot's ideals. Target the women and children with the necessities and joys of life. A new set of pots and pans will go a long way in our quest for peace. Yes, I served in the armed forces and I'm 61 years old. (""Why more violence,"" 2001) I would add one caveat. Many people in the world have never had a ""set of pots and pans"" to begin with, or regular access to food to fill those pots and pans. Would not a vital step in waging the dual-front war against global terrorismbe for the more prosperous nations to make a sus- tained commitment to help the poorer nations become better able to address their citizens' ba- sic needs? Blessed be the peacemakers and our protectors; may they be blessed with courage, wisdom, decisiveness--and compassion. REFERENCES American Psychiatric Association. (2000).

225,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1251/Files (250).DOCX","CE Noticias Financieras English",2020-11-03,"588 words",NA,NA,NA,"Guest Contributor / Eunice Rendón: Latin Vote",FALSE," For the first time in history, Latinos are the largest minority in the United States according to the Pew Research Center. They account for 13% of voter potential, outpersperating the African-American electorate with a 12% share, followed by Asian migrants with 4.7%. However, 32 million Latinos are eligible to vote, only about 17 million have registered to participate, of which 5 million have voted early, which is twice as much as the 2016 election. Youth is the key. 44% of Latinos who voted in 2016 were young. 
Since then, every year 1 million people of Latin origin are 18 years old, so we have 4 million more young people with the possibility of voting in these elections. Although Latinos have historically been among the groups with the least electoral participation, the community seems to be waking up and Latino youth acting to assert their voice and rights. Mexico is by far the most represented country with more than 67% of all Latinos in the United States, followed by Puerto Rico, Cuba, El Salvador and the Dominican Republic. 61% of migrants live in the country's four most populous states: California, New York, Texas and Florida. According to the Pew Research Center, 6 out of 10 Latinos plan to vote for Joe Biden. However, we must understand that the Hispanic community is not a single and homogeneous block. It matters their history, context, personal and family situation and whether they are first, second or third generation. Also, both some connationals who feel stable in the American Union and prefer that no more migrants enter, and most Cubans and Venezuelans because of the political situation of their home countries, are in favor of Trump. That's why Florida, a hinged state and one of the most electoral-heavy in which Latinos account for 20% of voters, shows, as in 2016, a very tight trend. The most important concerns expressed by Latinos for the upcoming elections are: economics, health, COVID-19, racism and migration as the fifth priority. However, all concerns relate in some way or another to anti-migrant policies and the impact of the pandemic on the Latino population. The Republican candidate has eliminated support and threatened to remove visas from those who over-use the health system. The Latino community is the group with the least health coverage. As a result, more than 20% of COVID deaths have affected COVID. Since Trump's arrival in the White House, race-based hate crimes have increased by 30%, mainly against Latinos, and the economy and employment that appeared to be his forte have diminished stems from the pandemic. Meanwhile, Biden has promised to end the separation of migrant families, support for dreamers, end The Remains in Mexico policy that has more than 60,000 Central Americans stranded at the border, and carry out immigration reform, as well as improvements in access to health. White Americans maintain their proportional decline and reach elections with 66.7% of the adult population (a decrease of nearly 10% since 2000). That is why, increasingly, the vote of minorities and in particular young Latinos matters. It's no coincidence how many messages were directed and even Trump's video dancing salsa to win this community's vote. In addition to the 12% of the GDP they contribute and the workforce they represent for the United States today, they also have the potential to be a key part of the 2020 election and beyond.

This mantra has been repeated by the likes of Pelosi, Schumer and other democrat leaders and TV News Pundits. This is ridiculous and a true example of Trump Derangement Syndrome. 
Recently Minn. Senator Amy Klobuchar is the latest to come forth with these allegations against Trump saying on ABC 'We are not safe in Donald Trump's America. Not only have we seen an increase in hate crimes, not only have we seen increases in crime, but we have seen 3,600 people die during the Republican Convention. Now over 180,000 people died from this coronavirus.' First of all these riots and violence are all happening in Democrat-run cities. Trump has asked the governors of each state and mayors of each city if they wanted any help in quelling the riots and they all said 'no' so this is what you get. These riots are run by Black Lives Matter and ANTIFA, two groups who want to change this country into something it is not. BLM is run by three self-admitted Marxists and they and ANTIFA are being funded by radical and sympathetic groups along with George SOROS who are just using them for their own goals. Stalin had a name for such people, he called them 'useful idiots' and they are. They will be discarded like yesterday's trash when they are through with them. Secondly to blame Trump for the increased deaths of this unholy Chinese virus is totally ridiculous since Trump has done more to stop it than any dem has or is still not doing. I've enumerated numerous times all the things Trump has done to stop this virus but will enumerate here again until it gets in everyone's head what he has accomplished with dealing with his virus China has unleashed on us. https://www.conservativedailynews.com/2020/09/democrats-riots-and-the-virus-must-be-trumps-fault/futuristic-glowing-low-polygonal-coronavirus-cells-banner-on-dark-blue-background-2/ After the first death from it Trump put a travel ban on China that saved millions of lives here. When it spread to Europe he put a travel ban on Europe which also saved lives here. The virus has since spiked in Spain and Italy once again. As the virus started spreading here, Trump set up the Javits Center in New York City with 3000 beds for virus victims that was never used since Gov,.Cumo sent corona victims to nursing homes where thousands needlessly died that shouldn't have. 'Older people, vulnerable people are going to die from this virus. That is going to happen despite whatever you do. Because with all our progress as a society, we can't keep everyone alive.' Cuomo said in statement. The goal was to free up hospitals' beds at a time when those facilities were being overwhelmed by fresh waves of virus patients. The Cuomo administration fired back: The State Department of Health issued a33-page report[1]meant to dispel the notion that its March directive fueled the spread of the virus. The report blamed the 37,500 nursing home workers — about a quarter of the state's total nursing home staff — who became infected since mid-March, unknowingly transmitting the virus to residents. 3) Trump also got the two huge hospital ships Comfort and Mercy that have 1000 beds each and12 operating rooms each here in record time, one on the East coast and one on the west coast that were never used.(Article Continues Below Advertisement) https://www.conservativedailynews.com/2020/09/democrats-riots-and-the-virus-must-be-trumps-fault/usns-mercy-transits-pacific-ocean-en-route-for-pp18/ Trump got the top CEO's of medical supply companies to the white house including Mike Lindell of My Pillow fame to pledge to give whatever anyone needed of their service s in emergency time. Mike Lindell pledged to turn 75% of his company over to making masks, gowns and sheets for hospitals. When Gov.Cumo asked for 40,000 ventilators, Trump go them for him only Cuomo found he didn't need them because he unknowingly had warehouse full of them so Trump gave the ventilators over to whoever needed them so no one went without a ventilator who needed one and any leftover he redistributed to other countries who needed them. Trump got the U.S. Army to set up makeshift hospitals around the country for overflow patients in regular hospitals Trump got a national testing program in effect and more recently has been promoting this new plasma cure for the virus. So where were the democrats all this time? Why they were sitting on their hands thinking of new ways to impeach him instead of lending a helping hand and now they blame him for increased deaths from the virus because he's holding rallies and an RNC convention ending with over 1200 people and no social distancing.. Meanwhile, A new report from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that in 94 percent of the cases of those who died from COVID-19, another disease was also at work on the victim. .Thereport[2]showed that in 18,116 of 42,587 deaths in the 75-84 age group, the individual who died also had the flu or pneumonia, while in 15,100 cases the underlying condition was respiratory failure. Overall, of the 161, 392 deaths covered by the report, 42 percent (68,004) of those who died also had the flu or pneumonia while 34 percent (54,803) had an underlying condition of respiratory failure. And for those who say 'Biden' would have handled the pandemic better, the facts very clearly show the exact opposite is the case. Biden even called Trump xenophobic and racist for stopping travel from Wuhan and anyone who'd been there recently from coming into the USA in early January and opposed that travel ban until late March. He's now proclaimed that he'd do so much better than Trump handling the pandemic by. doing exactly what Trump has already done long ago. https://www.conservativedailynews.com/2020/09/democrats-riots-and-the-virus-must-be-trumps-fault/bidenandtrump-2/ In fact, you can blame blue state Governors, especially Cuomo, for the majority of cases and deaths in the USA - it's been proven by genetic analysis that the majority of cases throughout the USA were seeded from New York - thanks to Cuomo refusing to shut down his state early when it was suggested by Trump and Trump's medical experts. Plus, a whole host of Dem leaders such as Pelosi, AOC, etc., who kept telling people to get out in public and act normally, see a movie, go shopping, etc., long after the virus had taken off and people were dropping dead from it in their own states and cities. Then the blue state governors like Cuomo idiotically required nursing homes to take and keep COVID positive patients!! Had they just immediately but briefly shut things down and implemented contact tracing as suggested by Trump, and not idiotically made nursing home keep and take infectious patients, this could have been really nipped in the bud early on and a tremendous number of lives and heartbreak saved. Here is A short list of some of Trump's accomplishments in only a few short years: **Two Constitutional conservative/originalist Supreme Court justices appointed. **A massive number of Constitutional conservatives/originalists appointed to federal courts throughout the nation. **300+ miles of wall built in areas where it was the most needed (zero under Obama). **Got Mexico to actually defend their southern border from illegal aliens entering, thus keeping them from traveling to the USA to enter here illegally **Historical America Canada Mexico treaty replacing NAFTA with provisions vastly more favorable to USA citizens and businesses **Manufacturing jobs way up. **Historic peace agreement between Israel and the UAE. **A new historic and major bipartisan criminal justice reform bill passed into law **Historic funding for historically black universities **Opportunity zones created for impoverished areas **Massive coronavirus relief funds for individuals and businesses **Massive pandemic supply support where needed to states **Utterly crucial national security steel production brought back to the USA from overseas **The same in progress for bringing medical drug production back to the USA, **Far more than three old regulations eliminated for every new one created **Fastest ever production of vaccines for brand new virus from identification of the virus to the start of phase three clinical trials **Blocked terrorists from entering the country by banning travel from a few countries where there was no way to do good background checks on those people because of their failed governments or terrorist-supporting governments Prior to the pandemic, **The lowest unemployment rates EVER for blacks, minorities, and women, and the lowest in many decades for all. **The income gap between blacks and whites lowest ever. and on and on and on. https://www.conservativedailynews.com/2020/08/the-republican-convention-part-4-what-a-finale/trumpgivesthumbsup/Wake up Right!

In its complaint to the FEC, CLC accused APN of running $7,665 in Facebook ads supporting third-party candidates without including legally required disclaimers. Even though APN complied with Facebook’s requirements for political ads, such that it was clear who was funding the ads, CLC asked the federal speech regulatory body to punish them for failing to comply with technical requirements of federal election laws.</p><p>CLC attempted to paint APN as a “fake political group” and theorized that it might be backed by major political party operatives or a foreign government. However, as Trainor explained, APN was in fact “established by an unsophisticated individual trying to show his support for several third-party candidates” who “got tripped by the myriad regulations governing online political speech.”</p><p>In an apology letter to the FEC, the head of APN explained that he wanted to comply with all requirements but was confused by Federal election laws as they applied to online speech…</p><p>In a “statement of reasons” for his vote to dismiss a complaint against American Progress Now, Trainor [wrote], “I am troubled that as a result of the Respondent’s interaction with the FEC, he has expressed his disinclination to continue exercising his First Amendment right to engage in political speech,” wrote Trainor.

Now, he has sent a message to the Federal Communications Commission: Cross me for misusing my powers in this way, and you’ll be punished, too.</p><p>Michael O’Rielly has served two terms on the FCC under two presidents, and was expected to serve another – until this week, when the White House announced it would withdraw his renomination. This unexpected notice came only days after Mr. O’Rielly gave a speech in which he exhorted listeners to “reject demands, in the name of the First Amendment, for private actors to curate or publish speech a certain way.” Such demands, not so incidentally, are precisely what’s contained in this spring’s executive order on social media sites, issued by the president after Twitter had the audacity to fact-check some of his more egregious tweets…</p><p>The Constitution was designed to enable free expression, not enable the government to stifle it…</p><p>This is a flagrant assault on the First Amendment under the guise of defending it, and an assault on those who seek to defend the right of free expression.</p><p><strong>FTC</strong></p><p>Digital News Daily: FTC Lacks Authority To Police Platforms’ Content Moderation Policies, Simons Says</p><p>By Wendy Davis</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission lacks the authority to oversee how social media companies curate political speech, Chairman Joe Simons told the Senate Commerce Committee Wednesday.</p><p>“Our authority focuses on commercial speech, not political content curation,” Simons told Chairman Roger Wicker (R-Mississippi) at an oversight hearing.</p><p>Simons’ statement came in response to questions from Wicker about President Trump’s recent attempt to crack down on social media platforms. In May, Trump issued an executive order that directed the FTC to consider taking action if websites “restrict speech in ways that do not align with those entities’ public representations about those practices.”</p><p>Trump said at the time that social media platforms were engaging in “selective censorship” based on viewpoint, despite a lack of empirical proof…</p><p>The FTC has long said it isn’t empowered to regulate political speech.</p><p>In 2004, for example, the FTC rejected a complaint against Fox News by advocacy group MoveOn.org, which had asked the agency to investigate whether the company dupes the public with the slogan “fair and balanced.”</p><p>“I am not aware of any instance in which the Federal Trade Commission has investigated the slogan of a news organization,” former FTC Chair Timothy Muris stated on July 19, 2004. “There is no way to evaluate this petition without evaluating the content of the news at issue. That is a task the First Amendment leaves to the American people, not a government agency.”</p><p><strong>State Department</strong></p><p>New York Times: State Dept.

The organization argues the order violates the First Amendment because it “seeks to curtail and chill the constitutionally protected speech of all online platforms and individuals.”</p><p>The order, issued in late May, directed the Commerce Department to petition the Federal Communications Commission to craft regulations that could deprive online platforms of the protections of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.</p><p>WTHR: ACLU lawsuit accuses State Police of interfering with death penalty protests</p><p>The American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana has filed a lawsuit against the Indiana State Police for allegedly interfering with those who protested in opposition to the July executions at the United States Penitentiary in Terre Haute. </p><p>According to the ACLU, State Police closed the roads leading to the prison and put significant barriers in place ahead of the executions, forcing demonstrators to protest nearly two miles away from the prison. The lawsuit claims these restrictions violate the protesters’ First Amendment rights.</p><p>“These restrictions obstruct one of the most fundamental rights protected by the Constitution, political speech. There is absolutely no justification for this overly broad ‘no-protest zone,'” said Ken Falk, legal director at the ACLU of Indiana, in a press release. “The Indiana State Police are severely compromising protesters’ ability to express themselves and to express their opposition to the death penalty while in sight of the prison.” …</p><p>Click here to read the full complaint.</p><p><strong>Congress</strong></p><p>The Hill: House Democrat calls on Facebook to take down doctored Pelosi video</p><p>By Chris Mills Rodrigo</p><p>Rep.

The study suggests that reporters in the nation’s capital “may be even more insular than previously thought,” says its authors, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign professors Nikki Usher and Yee Man Margaret Ng.</p><p>This obviously raises “additional concerns about vulnerability to groupthink and blind spots,” they add.</p><p>“Political journalists in D.C. are people who use Twitter all day,” said Usher. “And so the question is what does that do to how they think about the world. And generally … it seems to me that it can make things worse.”</p><p><strong>Online Speech Platforms</strong></p><p>Washington Post: Facebook, Twitter penalize Trump for posts containing coronavirus misinformation</p><p>By Heather Kelly</p><p>Facebook and Twitter on Wednesday took extraordinary action against President Trump for spreading coronavirus misinformation after his official and campaign accounts broke their rules, respectively.</p><p>Facebook removed from Trump’s official account the post of a video clip from a Fox News interview in which he said children are “almost immune” from covid-19. Twitter required his Team Trump campaign account to delete a tweet with the same video, blocking it from tweeting in the interim.</p><p>In the removed video, President Trump can be heard in a phone interview saying schools should open.

PolitiFact called the allegations “false,” as did CheckYourFact. The Associated Press detailed “distortions” in Trump’s claims. FactCheck.org called an ad airing them “deceptive.” Another site, the Dispatch, said there is “nothing currently to support” Trump’s claims.</p><p>But these judgments, made by five fact-checking organizations that are part of Facebook’s independent network for policing falsehoods on the platform, were not shared with Facebook’s users. That is because the company specifically exempts politicians from its rules against deception. Ads containing the falsehoods continue to run freely on the platform, without any kind of warning or label.</p><p>Enabled by Facebook’s rules, Trump’s reelection campaign has shown versions of the false claim on Facebook at least 22.5 million times, in more than 1,400 ads costing between $350,000 and $553,000, a Washington Post analysis found based on data from Facebook’s Ad Library…</p><p>Biden’s campaign has not taken similar advantage of Facebook’s leniency about political claims. Fact-checkers working with Facebook have found far fewer misleading statements from him or his campaign, a review of their work since May found. </p><p>New York Times: TikTok Takes Steps to Curb Misinformation Ahead of U.S. Election</p><p>By Reuters</p><p>Video-sharing app TikTok has updated its content policies to curb misinformation on its platform ahead of the presidential election in the United States, the company said on Wednesday.</p><p>The app, which has come under fire by U.S. lawmakers and the Trump administration over national security concerns due to its Chinese ownership, said it was working with experts from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to “protect against foreign influence”. </p><p>TikTok said it would expand partnerships with PolitiFact and Lead Stories to fact-check potential misinformation about the election. It will also allow users to report vote-related misinformation on the app, the company said in a blog post.</p><p>The company, which does not allow political advertising and said in the blog post it was not the “go-to app to follow news or politics,” has increasingly emerged as a platform for political discourse and activism. </p><p><strong>Candidates and Campaigns</strong></p><p>CNN: Trump campaign calls for a fourth presidential debate, citing early voting</p><p>By Dan Merica, Donald Judd, and Ryan Nobles</p><p>Donald Trump’s presidential campaign called for an additional presidential debate in a letter to the Commission on Presidential Debates on Wednesday.</p><p>Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York who represents the Trump campaign on debate issues, wrote in the letter that the current debate schedule is an “outdated dinosaur and not reflective of voting realities in 2020,” citing the fact that millions of Americans will have the ability to vote early before the first general election debate in late September.</p><p>“For a nation already deprived of a traditional campaign schedule because of the COVID-19 global pandemic, it makes no sense to also deprive so many Americans of the opportunity to see and hear the two competing visions for our country’s future before millions of votes have been cast,” Giuliani wrote.</p><p>Giuliani wrote in the letter that if the commission will not add a fourth debate, “we strongly urge the Commission to move up the final debate (currently scheduled for October 22, 2020) to instead happen during the first week in September.”</p><p>CBS News: Trump wants to deliver his GOP convention speech at White House.

Punctured paintings with cutouts of various shapes and sizes are a notable feature in the paintings of Argentinian artist Fernanda Laguna. She accents her work with cotton balls, seashells and other items with emotional connections.
Laguna, who gained prominence as a literary figure in South America, made her U.S. debut on Saturday at the Institute for Contemporary Art in ""As Everybody."" The exhibit showcases the last 10 years of Laguna's work.
""It all started in art school when I decided to be an artist - because I wanted to be a hippie,"" Laguna said during a virtual event on Saturday. ""I wanted to change, I came from a Catholic background and I wanted to become something else, and I wanted to do it through art.""
In paintings like ""Not At All,"" Laguna lets her humor and personality take flight through unconventional artistic choices. The artist uses abstract shapes throughout the exhibit, as well as seashells, clothing and frames made of wicker, a common furniture material in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

""Things that we think of as high value and low value just get all mixed up together and you sort of lose sight of ... traditional views of value,"" said Dominic Willsdon, curator and ICA director. ""Museums are, in a way, devices for saying that something is more valuable than something else."" 
Willsdon, who met Laguna for the first time in 2013, said it's important to look at how artists are advancing social agendas and dealing with contemporary representation. 
On the wall between some paintings, lines from Laguna's poem, ""Sad,"" are written in cursive. ICA Lead Preparator Andy Clifford mimicked the cursive print that accompanied some of the paintings.
""My sweet child you come flying in towards the light,"" one line reads. ""I Fall on this country and I try to see you ... often.""
Due to COVID-19, Laguna was unable to visit the ICA to install the exhibit. Artists at the ICA used projections of Laguna's drawings to add final touches, such as hand-drawn cartoon faces, bows and ribbons.
One room of the exhibit is dedicated to ""living memorabilia"" of South American grassroots organizations, including Ni Una Menos, a fourth-wave feminist movement that started in Argentina. Laguna has been a founding member of the movement since its formation in 2015 and said its work in sex-based hate crimes and other women's rights issues is integral to her art.
""As activists, they chose to make a collection of the visual and material culture of the movement,"" Willsdon said. ""This is a sample of that collection of stuff that they've been putting together for a few years to tell the story of this movement.""
The installation is titled ""Mareadas en la marea,"" which translates to ""high on the tide."" The selection was co-curated by Laguna and Cecilia Palmeiro, a Latin American studies and gender theory professor at New York University.
A long banner hangs on one of the walls, containing drawings of women and feminist chants such as ""Machismo = Fachismo."" The rest of the room is scattered with posters, paintings of diverse groups of women and informational flyers for visitors. 
Laguna said she enjoys using her creativity to explore the intersection between art and activism.
""I think that it is very important,"" she said.""I believe that creativity is like moving hidden strings and can really achieve amazing changes or transformations.""
""As Everybody"" will be on display at the Institute for Contemporary Art until Jan. 10."
229,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1251/Files (250).DOCX","The Hollywood Reporter",2020-07-14,"1010 words","NEWS; TAG","Kareem Abdul-Jabbar",NA,"Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Where Is the Outrage Over Anti-Semitism in Sports and Hollywood?",FALSE,"Recent incidents of anti-Semitic tweets and posts from sports and entertainment celebrities are a very troubling omen for the future of the Black Lives Matter movement, but so too is the shocking lack of massive indignation. Given the New Woke-fulness in Hollywood and the sports world, we expected more passionate public outrage. What we got was a shrug of meh-rage.
When reading the dark squishy entrails of popular culture, meh-rage in the face of sustained prejudice is an indisputable sign of the coming Apatholypse: apathy to all forms of social justice. After all, if it's OK to discriminate against one group of people by hauling out cultural stereotypes without much pushback, it must be OK to do the same to others. Illogic begets illogic.
Ice Cube's June 10 daylong series of tweets, which involved some creepy symbols and images, in general implied that Jews were responsible for the oppression of blacks. NFL player DeSean Jackson tweeted out several anti-Semitic messages, including a quote he incorrectly thought was from Hitler (not your go-to guy for why-can't-we-all-get-along quotes) stating that Jews had a plan to ""extort America"" and achieve ""world domination."" Isn't that SPECTRE's job in James Bond movies?
These statements would be laughed at by anyone with a middle-school grasp of reason, but then former NBA player Stephen Jackson, a self-proclaimed activist, undid whatever progress his previous advocacy may have achieved by agreeing with DeSean Jackson on social media. Then he went on to talk about the Rothschilds owning all the banks and his support for the notorious homophobe and anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan. That is the kind of dehumanizing characterization of a people that causes the police abuses that killed his friend, George Floyd.
June continued to bust out all over with anti-Semitism when performer Chelsea Handler, herself Jewish, posted videos of Farrakhan to her 3.9 million followers. That means almost 4 million people received a subliminal message that even some Jews think being anti-Jewish is justified.
That same month, President Donald Trump's reelection campaign also has been criticized for exploiting anti-Jewish biases, even though Trump's son-in-law and campaign honcho Jared Kushner is Jewish and his daughter Ivanka converted to Judaism before they married. Playing on the same Rothschild's trope, they issued a letter accusing three billionaires of Jewish descent of using their fortunes to ""rig the November election."" This is the kind of ""very fine people on both sides"" Trump has employed throughout his political career - pandering to hate groups that has emboldened racists who feel like they've gotten the presidential OK to attack people they don't like.
These famous, outspoken people share the same scapegoat logic as all oppressive groups from Nazis to the KKK: all our troubles are because of bad-apple groups that worship wrong, have the wrong complexion, come from the wrong country, are the wrong gender or love the wrong gender. It's so disheartening to see people from groups that have been violently marginalized do the same thing to others without realizing that perpetuating this kind of bad logic is what perpetuates racism.
Yes, some of the above have apologized - DeSean Jackson, Stephen Jackson, Chelsea Handler - while others continue to defiantly marinate in their own prejudice. Their arrogant and irrational response to accusations of anti-Semitism, rather than dissuade us, actually confirmed people's worst opinions. Ice Cube's response was remorseless: ""What if I was just pro-Black? This is the truth brother. I didn't lie on anyone. I didn't say I was anti anybody. DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE. I've been telling my truth."" His ""truth"" was clearly anti-Semitic but, like Trump, he believes his truth exists outside facts. As writer Roxane Gay summed it up: ""It is impossible to take you seriously with regards to social justice or anything when you post anti-Semitic imagery. What the fuck are you doing?""
Even the apologies floundered, more attempts at spin than true contrition. In a CNN interview, Stephen Jackson was angry and belligerent at being called out: ""I stated I could have changed my words. There's nothing that I said that I support any of that. There's nothing I said that I hate anybody. I apologize for my words and I could have switched up. That's the end of it. I love everybody."" While it's possible the words were wrong, celebrities have a responsibility to get the words right. It's not enough to have good intentions, because it's the actual deeds - and words - which have the real impact. In this case destructive impact. In 2013, there were 751 reported hate crimes against Jews, but by 2019 the number had nearly tripled to 2,107. That same year, a gunman in San Diego entered a synagogue and murdered one person while wounding three.
One of the most powerful songs in the struggle against racism is Billie Holiday's melancholic ""Strange Fruit,"" which was first recorded in 1939. The song met strong resistance from radio stations afraid of its graphic lyrics about lynching:
Southern trees bear a strange fruit
 Blood on the leaves and blood at the root
 Black bodies swinging in the Southern breeze
 Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees
Despite those who wanted to suppress the song, it went on to sell a million copies that year and became Holiday's best-selling record ever. The song was written by a white, Jewish high school teacher, Abel Meeropol, who performed it with his wife around New York before it was given to Holiday.
The lesson never changes, so why is it so hard for some people to learn: No one is free until everyone is free. As Martin Luther King Jr. explained: ""Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality."" So, let's act like it. If we're going to be outraged by injustice, let's be outraged by injustice against anyone.

United University Professions, the nation's largest higher education union, today called on New York state and SUNY to be the engine of transformation during a time when our state and nation are facing multifaceted crises: a pandemic, economic recession and social upheaval caused by institutionalized violence against people of color.
""The time for bold, wide-ranging change is now,"" UUP President Frederick Kowal stated. ""As Martin Luther King Jr. said, 'The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.' However, there are moments in history when we need to step up and push or that arc won't bend.
""Now is the time that our union and the SUNY system need to lead the way in instituting and pursuing change through legislation, SUNY policy and education.""
UUP applauds the state Legislature for its actions on police reform bills and urges lawmakers to approve proposals backed by the Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic & Asian Legislative Caucus. Those proposals include repeal of the 50-A provision allowing police departments to block public access to disciplinary records; criminalizing police choke holds; charging 911 callers who make false accusations based on race, gender or religion with hate crimes; the banning of racial and ethnic profiling by police; and requiring state police officers to wear body cameras.
""The Memorial Day death of George Floyd, an unarmed, handcuffed black man who died after a police officer kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes, has lit a fire in America that will not be extinguished until racial injustice and inequality are snuffed out,"" said UUP President Frederick E. Kowal. ""People have seen and had enough. The time has come to make reforms across the spectrum of society that will achieve lasting, positive change.
""We must seize this opportunity and send an unmistakable message that America will no longer turn away at the sight of racial inequality or shrug at the reality of climate injustice or discrimination against people of color or those who don't fall neatly into biased societal norms,"" he continued. ""The passage of police reform measures by the Legislature is a good first step. But we cannot stop there.""
The union is putting its words into action. Kowal said that UUP will commit a substantial amount of union resources for inclusivity training for members, their families and communities that host SUNY campuses. UUP is also encouraging SUNY to select a chancellor who comes from communities that, for too long, have been underrepresented.
The union also believes the time is now to institute real, substantive change to begin to address systematic racism through changes to the health care system, addressing the climate crisis, and expanding diversity and educational opportunities. UUP has been fighting for these changes and introduced a set of policy recommendations in its NY25 policy proposal, released earlier this year.
Health care and climate change
Health care reform is part of UUP's social change agenda. UUP represents more than 12,000 members at SUNY's public teaching hospitals in Brooklyn, Stony Brook and Syracuse, and University at Buffalo-affiliated teaching hospitals, with the Brooklyn facility--SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University--designated as a COVID-19-only hospital.
The union backs publicly funded universal health care; an aggressive expansion of medical care access through expansion of state-funded clinics linked to SUNY's public teaching hospitals; expanding maternal and child care services at SUNY Downstate to help alleviate massively disproportionate maternal mortality rates affecting black women; and cutting tuition and creating a SUNY Medical Educational Opportunity Program to attract a larger, more diverse population of medical care professionals.
Enacting UUP's climate change proposals would create hundreds of thousands of new jobs while mitigating the climate crisis that disproportionately affects communities of color and worsens the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic.
Those proposals include retrofitting SUNY buildings to make SUNY carbon-neutral before 2025; setting up microgrids and battery storage sites at SUNY campuses; and expanding sustainability programs at SUNY to retrain thousands of people to work in green energy jobs.
""The coronavirus crisis and the climate crisis are two manifestations of environmental injustice,"" said Kowal. ""To address both, I believe that SUNY is uniquely positioned to be the change agent it must be through greatly expanding access to high quality health care and building the infrastructure for a truly green economy.""
Expanding diversity
Kowal said UUP is calling for SUNY's next chancellor to be a person of color. SUNY Chancellor Kristina Johnson announced her resignation June 3.
""SUNY needs to be more diverse, and I can't think of a better way to begin to accomplish that than by starting at the top,"" said Kowal.
By 2025, the union also wants 25 percent of SUNY's faculty, staff and administration positions to be filled by persons of color, including those who are African American, Native American and Latinx. The recruitment and retention of those coming from underrepresented populations will require investment of resources that will benefit the university and the student experience across SUNY, the union argues.
UUP believes that college must be affordable to all. The union supports a cap on tuition and fees through 2025 and doubling funding and student enrollment in SUNY's opportunity programs.
""As a state and nation, our focus needs to be on justice and equality during these incredibly difficult times. As institutions across the country are failing us, it is time to lead the change, reform the institutions, or eliminate those that refuse to be part of progress,"" Kowal stated.

UUP is the nation's largest higher education union, with more than 42,000 academic and professional faculty and retirees. UUP members work at 29 New York state-operated campuses, including SUNY's public teaching hospitals and health science centers in Brooklyn, Long Island and Syracuse. It is an affiliate of NYSUT, the American Federation of Teachers, the National Education Association, and the AFL-CIO.

231,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1251/Files (250).DOCX","Targeted News Service",2020-09-09,"638 words",NA,"Targeted News Service",NA,"Victory Fund Condemns Homophobic Attacks on Jon Hoadley",FALSE,"(TNSPPX) -- The Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund issued the following news release on Sept. 8:
Today LGBTQ Victory Fund, the only national organization dedicated to electing LGBTQ leaders to public office, condemned a homophobic attack campaign by U.S. Rep. Fred Upton and the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) that targets Michigan state Rep. Jon Hoadley, who is running against Rep. Upton for U.S. Congress. Victory Fund is demanding an immediate end to the homophobic attacks and for Rep. Upton and the NRCC to apologize for perpetuating harmful homophobic stereotypes. The NRCC is a political committee of the Republican Party tasked with helping to elect Republican members of the U.S. House and Upton is one of their most vulnerable incumbents.
For weeks, the NRCC has repeatedly referred to Hoadley as a ""pedo sex poet"" - a startling and defamatory use of homophobic tropes about gay men as pedophiles and sexual deviants. It also successfully pitched a political hit piece to the New York Post that purposely took phrases out of context from a 15-year-old live journal Hoadley wrote while an undergraduate student. They then use those phrases to make outrageous claims about Hoadley - all of them aimed at perpetuating homophobic stereotypes about gay men. Campaign mailers sent to voters' homes use the same phrases to attack Hoadley.
""Fred Upton is resorting to digging up Jon's puerile college blog posts and pulling together out-of-context words and phrases because he can find nothing else to criticize about Jon's public service record,"" said Annise Parker, President & CEO of LGBTQ Victory Fund. ""If Upton wants to be a digital avenger working to critique 15-year-old internet postings, why does he remain silent on the racist, sexist, transphobic and anti-immigrant tweets that are a constant from this White House? Where is his rebuttal of Donald Trump's tweets denying the extent of a pandemic that has killed 180,000 Americans with no end in sight? It is pathetic to see Fred resort to becoming an internet troll at a time when our president's words and actions have led to a resurgence in hate crimes, white supremacy and divisiveness. Any media outlet that reports on Fred's take on Jon's internet musings from 15 years ago should also ask for Fred's takes on Trump's tweets from just the past week.""
A reading of the live blog posts reveals the extent of the distortion and smear campaign by Upton and the NRCC - using small sections of posts to claim Hoadley mocks women, uses drugs, victimizes sexual partners and is a pedophile. Each reference is addressed and debunked below:
* Hoadley is a champion for women. He has continuously been a champion for women's rights in the legislature, advocating for equal pay legislation, reproductive rights, childcare resources and beyond. This fixation on a bad attempt at humor when he was just 21 - for which he has also issued an apology - aims to paint him as a sexist and to distract from the actual issues - including women's issues - at hand in this election.
* Outdated pedophilia tropes against an LGBTQ candidate. In a clearly satirical discussion about whether all 'gay men desire to be flower girls' an aforementioned friend jokes that he has no desire to see a 'four-year-old wearing a thong'"" as a condemnation of the hypersexualization of children. The phrase has been removed from context to somehow imply that Jon is a pedophile, an accusation that has been repeated multiple times in many ways by the NRCC and its staff.
* Implied drug usage. The original passage details that Hoadley went to leather bar to ""learn about crystal meth"" and attended an informational meeting about the drug's impact on the LGTBQ+ community. He ended the post by writing, ""Don't do meth.""

Pompeo, it's not too late; CNN's shameless assault on the memory of the Holocaust; Douglas Murray: The Nobel Peace Prize has become an ignoble joke",FALSE,"Nov 19, 2020( Elder of Ziyon: http://elderofziyon.blogspot.com Delivered by Newstex) From Ian: Arnold Roth: Put justice back on the agenda: Sec. Pompeo, it's not too late[1] We did something yesterday that we have never done before. We ordered a display advertisement to appear on the front-page of a major print newspaper - today's (Thursday's) Jerusalem Post. Our message is on its front page. The timing of our ad is intended to coincide with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's visit to Israel that began yesterday afternoon (Wednesday November 18). Our hope is that he will see it at breakfast. And that perhaps he will think about the images we included, as well as the scriptural quote at the top of the text: 'Justice, justice thou shalt pursue'. The words from Deuteronomy (Devarim in Hebrew) will be recited in the annual cycle of Torah reading when we get to Parshat Shoftim, the weekly portion called 'Judges'. That happens next in August 2021. By coincidence, the same week will include the twentieth anniversary of the Sbarro pizzeria massacre. There are two images in our Pompeo advertisement. One shows Malki. The other is of the devastated Sbarro pizzeria in the center of Jerusalem, minutes after a bomb placed by Ahlam Tamimi exploded inside.
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EnNKxgFXMAAophA?format=jpg&#38;name=largeBrendan O'Neill: CNN's shameless assault on the memory of the Holocaust[2]Such moral instability has been widespread among the anti-Trump elites these past four years. Trump is 'literally Hitler', in these people's eyes. 'Donald Trump is a fascist', serious outlets have suggested, denuding that word of all meaning. A British MP spoke of Trump in the same breath as 'fascist dictators Mussolini and Hitler'. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said Trump was running 'concentration camps' on the America-Mexico border and, for good measure, she said the phrase 'Never Again' has to 'mean something'. That's a phrase used about the Holocaust. AOC was suggesting that something akin to the Holocaust happened in the US under the Trump administration. No doubt she and her fawning followers think such Holocaust-talk lands a blow against Trump, but the truth is it lands a far greater blow on the memory of the Holocaust, which once again is reduced to a mundane event, like temporarily placing illegal immigrants in a camp. Even historians who ought to know better embraced the Trump-as-Hitler meme. Ron Rosenbaum, author of Explaining Hitler, says he was initially reluctant to talk to the media about Trump's 'fascistic tendencies', because however bad Trump might be, 'he did not seem bent on genocide'. Then he changed his mind and declared that Trump seems to be working from the 'playbook of Mein Kampf'. All these people - and this includes the many anti-Trump protesters who waved placards mentioning Hitler and the Holocaust - seem alarmingly unaware of how much damage they have done to historical memory. Holocaust Relativism is a close cousin of Holocaust Denial. As the Open University's guide to the Holocaust rightly says: 'Relativising the Holocaust has been one of the classic techniques of some of those engaged in Holocaust Denial.' Much of the new anti-Semitism is drenched in Holocaust Relativism. From left-wing anti-Semites to radical Islamists, the cry often goes out: 'Why do we talk about the Holocaust so much? It wasn't that special. Bad things happen all the time.' Amanpour and a host of other anti-Trump obsessives in the media and political elites are unwittingly stirring up this cynical and often racist minimisation of the Holocaust with their cheap, ahistorical shots at Trump. We hear a lot about the political wreckage left by Trump after his four years in the White House. But one of the worst kinds of damage done over the past four years was to the memory of the Holocaust, and it was done by Trump-bashers. Their reduction of the Holocaust to a political plaything, an exclamation mark to emphasise just how much they hate Trump, has been devastating to the cause of truth. Restoring the reality of the Holocaust will be essential if we are to defend truth in the 21st century and challenge the racist minimisation of the new anti-Semites.Douglas Murray: The Nobel Peace Prize has become an ignoble joke[3]For those of us who have long been suspicious of the Nobel Peace Prize, there is nothing quite like the sight of the prize committee struggling to rein in one of their former honourees. Last year, the committee gave its award to Abiy Ahmed, the Ethiopian Prime Minister. In the citation, it especially noted Mr Ahmed's laudable efforts 'to achieve peace and international cooperation'. That citation might now need to be carefully edited, since Mr Ahmed has declared war on the leaders of the Tigray region and Ethiopia looks like it is sliding into a wider conflagration. Last year's Peace Prize recipient has this year refused all requests for dialogue and attempts to de-escalate the conflict. Some critics are even making claims of ethnic cleansing. Yet in some ways Mr Ahmed stands in a long and ignoble Nobel tradition. This is not the first time that the committee would appear to have backed a wrong-un. Aung San Suu Kyi was given the award in 1991. Now she is an international pariah accused of defending genocide in Burma. In 1994, the committee gave the Peace Prize to Yasser Arafat, then probably the most notorious terrorist in the world. True this was a few years after the first 'Intifada'. But having collected his gong and his Nobel loot (not the only loot Arafat managed to acquire in his criminal career), he gave it a couple of years before declaring another Intifada. Just having the gong doesn't appear to bring about peaceful instincts. Surprising that. A friendly observer might put this down to bad luck on the part of the Nobel committee: an over-eagerness, perhaps even a blind desire to see the best in people. But any reasonable critic would have to admit that there has been something off with the prize for years. It has become a victim of John O'Sullivan's law: that all institutions that aren't statedly conservative drift Left-wards as the years go on. In 2009, the committee famously gave the prize to Barack Obama, when he was not yet one year into office, and when he had still not achieved anything of note. But the Nobel committee seemed to want to congratulate Obama on just being Obama. In the same way that a few years ago almost every award in the world was given to Caitlyn (formerly Bruce) Jenner, simply for being stunning and brave. If you are a Left-wing politician like Obama, the Nobel Peace Prize has become just another of those gongs you collect on your endless victory laps of the world. Understanding the hypocrisy of the Muslim world - opinion[4]IN FACT, in 2019, when most European countries condemned the persecution the Uighurs faced, most Muslim countries - such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the Palestinian Authority, Iran and Pakistan - cowardly commended China's measures to combat extremism, even going as far as to participate in the state's rhetoric that 'all ethnic groups enjoy their happy life in a peaceful and stable environment' and stating that China had maintained 'openness and transparency.' Erdogan's Turkey, once a champion of Uighurs' rights, has started arresting and deporting exiled Uighurs in order to safeguard its economic and political interests with China. The hypocrisy demonstrated by these leaders proves that their aim isn't to tackle Islamophobia but to attack freedom of speech. Freedom of speech is the bedrock of democracy and it represents an existential threat to autocratic regimes, especially those that pretend to be democracies. The countries that attacked France for Islamophobia are merely attempting to distract their populations from their mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic, and their countries' excessive corruption and worsening economic conditions. This is nothing more than a cheap political ploy to consolidate power. It should come as no surprise that the most fervent opponents to France's lacit (secularism) are also the countries with the strictest censorship and restrictions on freedom of speech. The right to blasphemy, regardless of how disrespectful it may be to some, is a core value that allows us to hold and debate different interpretations of all religions. When we allow the demagogues and fanatics to impose what should and should not be tolerated, we also allow them to define what Islam is for nearly two billion people. Most Muslims reject this radical interpretation of Islam. It is time for them to stand in solidarity with France in defense of freedom of speech. Instead of attributing the blame on the cartoonists for drawing caricatures of the prophet, they should unequivocally condemn those who incite violence. The ability to criticize and mock all ideologies, religions and political figures allows us to engage in open discourse. Democracy isn't simply about being allowed to vote, but also about having the freedom to express our minds and choose our beliefs, even if it might at times be uncomfortable.'The Occupation Made Me Beat My Wife'[5]Jews have been accused of harming and murdering non-Jews since the twelfth century in England, when Jewish convert to Catholicism, Theobald of Cambridge, mendaciously announced that European Jews ritually slaughtered Christian children each year and drank their blood during Passover season. That medieval blood libel, largely abandoned in the contemporary West, does, however, still appear as part of Arab world's vilification of Jews—now transmogrified into a slander against Israel, the Jew of nations. But in the regular chorus of defamation against Israel by a world infected with Palestinianism, a new, more odious trend has begun to show itself: the blood libel has been revivified; however, to position Israel (and by extension Jews) as demonic agents in the community of nations, the primitive fantasies of the blood libel are now masked with a veneer of academic scholarship and published as politicized scientific study. At a November 12th session at the UN's annual assembly, for example, The World Health Organization (WHO) used the gathering to again bash Israel and accuse it of compromising the health rights of Palestinian during the COVID-19 pandemic. Even Iran—where gays are still hanged from cranes and women are stoned to death—chimed in, asserting that Israel's pernicious role in Palestinian health conditions was worse than the fall-out from the pandemic in all other countries, and that Israel's 'chronic occupation has profound implications for the health of Palestinians. More than 12 years of inhuman blockade has had a profound effect on the health sector, worsening an already dire situation.'Anti-Israel Radical Karine Jean-Pierre Named as Possible Joe Biden Press Secretary[6]Karine Jean-Pierre, an anti-Israel radical who praised Democrats for shunning a pro-Israel conference last year, has emerged as a top contender to be Joe Biden's White House press secretary, according to several news sources. NBC News' Geoff Bennett cited 'multiple sources' Wednesday as saying that Jean-Pierre, currently an aide to Biden's running mate Kamala Harris, was the top candidate for the position. If Jean-Pierre is chosen, she would be the first woman of color to serve as press secretary. Jean-Pierre, then a national spokesperson and senior adviser for the George Soros-funded left-wing group MoveOn.org, lauded the 2020 presidential candidates for boycotting AIPAC, the annual bipartisan pro-Israel gathering, in 2019. (AIPAC stands for American-Israel Public Affairs Committee). Writing in Newsweek, Jean-Pierre maintained that the Democratic candidates 'made the right call,' and that AIPAC's policies and values 'are not progressive.' You cannot call yourself a progressive while continuing to associate yourself with an organization like AIPAC that has often been the antithesis of what it means to be progressive,' she wrote. She blasted AIPAC's opposition to the Iran nuclear deal, as well as its decision to invite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to speak (as it does with every Israeli prime minister), saying that 'under his leadership of Israel, according to the United Nations, Israel may have committed war crimes in its attacks on Gazan protesters.' The protests she referred to along the Gaza border were violent riots in which firebombs, rocks and explosive devices were routinely hurled at Israeli soldiers. Rioters also made holes in the border fence and infiltrated into Israeli territory.Agudath Israel Files Suit in US Supreme Court to Reopen Synagogues Amid Heightened COVID Rates[7]Agudath Israel of America and two affiliated congregations have taken their lawsuit against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo to the US Supreme Court as they seek to overturn his closure of houses of worship as part of the state's COVID-19 'cluster initiative' to prevent the spread of ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The filing for an emergency injunction by the national Agudath organization and two of its local congregations—Agudath Israel of Kew Garden Hills in Queens and Agudath Israel of Midwood in Brooklyn—against Cuomo's orders comes nearly a week after a panel from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals denied the plaintiff's motion for injunctive relief. Agudath's suit is one of several filed in recent weeks after the governor divided the state up into different 'zones' based on the severity of COVID-19 in that region. Each zone had different rules and regulations. However, the most severe rules appear aimed at neighborhoods with large Orthodox populations in Orange and Rockland counties, and in Brooklyn and Queens, NY. 'It's bad enough when the government puts religion in the back of the line when it comes to reopening during the pandemic. It's even worse when the government targets a particular religion for special disfavor,' said Joe Davis, counsel at Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, one of two firms acting as counsel for Agudath Israel. 'A ruling for the synagogues will show that, even during a pandemic, governments in this country aren't permitted to scapegoat Orthodox Jews based on little more than irrational fear and spite.' Also representing the plaintiffs is the firm of Troutman Pepper Hamilton Sander LLP in New York.A thorn by any other name: UK Jewish groups may be rebranding 'anti-Semitism'[8]In the maelstrom and vitriol that followed the Equality and Human Rights Commission's damning report into the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn last month, few noticed the near total omission in the response from the Jewish community of the very word the EHRC had just reported on: 'Anti-Semitism.' In a joint statement, the Board of Deputies and the Jewish Leadership Council said the report 'disgraces those who attacked us for speaking out against anti-Jewish racism,' calling Jeremy Corbyn 'a figurehead for old and new anti-Jewish attitudes.' The Jewish Labour Movement said it had been warning of a 'deepening casual culture of anti-Jewish racism' since 2015. The Holocaust Educational Trust said it confirmed 'the depth of the endemic anti-Jewish racism in Labour.' Labour Friends of Israel praised Keir Starmer for starting 'to root out anti-Jewish racism.' Even Labour Against Antisemitism (LAAS) distanced itself from its own name, talking about the party's 'institutional anti-Jewish racism.' Commentators soon picked up the baton. In his searing column, Jonathan Freedland of the Guardian began with 'antisemitism' but ended up asking 'why anti-Jewish racism might take root.' Success for CAA as backbench MPs will today debate a resolution calling for Government to bring forward Online Harms Bill, echoing our petition signed by thousands[9]In response to our petition calling for the Government to bring forward its Online Harms Bill, we have received confirmation that there will be a debate in Parliament today on 'regulation and prevention of online harms'. The subject of the debate was determined not by the Government, however, but by the Backbench Business Committee. Specifically, the debate is on a motion that proposes 'that the House recognises the need to take urgent action to reduce and prevent online harms and urges the Government to bring forward the Online Harms Bill as soon as possible'. Campaign Against Antisemitism launched a petition in August, in the aftermath of the Wiley episode, calling for new legislation urgently to introduce a requirement for technology companies to remove racist incitement within set timeframes, a duty of care for social networks with personal liability for executives, and tighter requirements to provide evidence to police under warrant.Bahrain, UAE vote against Israeli sponsored UN entrepreneurship resolution[10]The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain voted against an Israeli sponsored resolution on entrepreneurship for sustainable development, even though both countries are themselves in the midst of promoting joint business ties with the Jewish state. The resolution passed 144-26, with nine abstentions. Arab countries that voted against the resolution also included Egypt, Jordan, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Among the nine countries that abstained were Turkey and South Africa. Sudan and South Sudan were absent. The resolution itself had over 50 co-sponsors, was global in nature and was not connected to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or the burgeoning Israeli normalization deals with the Arab world. The text's focus was global accessibility of entrepreneurship. But the issue of Israel and antagonism to the Jewish state were reflected in some of the votes taken. Mauritania, in the name of the Arab group, accused Israel of being disingenuous in its annual sponsorship of this resolution, given the steps it takes to prevent Palestinian development such as the destruction of infrastructure. 'The occupation also violates numerous human rights of the Palestinian people,' the country said. BDS calls to boycott those involved in normalization[11]The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel has updated its boycott criteria, now calling for boycotts against anyone involved in normalized ties with Israel. As published on the official BDS website by the BDS National Committee (BNC), its members and supporters are now called on to refrain from ""displaying or promoting the works or products of those who their involvement in normalization practices are proven, until such involvement is ended in a convincing manner and in public, including a declaration of commitment to anti-normalization and cultural boycott.' The statement also includes ""not dealing with any product or activity of a person or institution that has previously been involved in normalization and has not withdrawn from it.' The announcement was made following longstanding criticisms directed at the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Sudan for their official normalization of ties with Israel, something that was perceived by many as a ""betrayal"" of the Palestinian cause. In fact, on September 15, the day ties with the UAE and Bahrain were officially normalized, the BNC published an update on the English-language BDS site titled ""The UAE and Bahrain's dictators are selling out the Palestinian people.""Brooklyn College Adopts Universal Definition of Antisemitism[12]The student senate at Brooklyn College in New York adopted the widely accepted International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism on Tuesday. The IHRA definition says: 'Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.' Of the 14,970 undergraduates at Brooklyn College, as many as 4,000 of them are Jewish, or 27 percent of the student body, while out of the school's 2,841 graduates, some 500, or 18 percent, are Jewish, according to Hillel International.'Cheating' Jew replaced in video[13]THE removal of a visibly Orthodox Jewish character from an animated video about plagiarism, collusion and contract cheating on the Monash University website has been hailed as a 'victory for people power' by the Anti-Defamation Commission (ADC). Discussing different scenarios, the short cartoon's first case study featured a bearded IT student wearing a kippah asking a fellow student if he could use her code, while a narrator asked, 'What do you think about students sharing programming code and then submitting this as individual work? Is this collusion?' The video prompted a storm of criticism when it was posted on Facebook by the ADC over the weekend. Within a few hours, the Jewish student had been replaced by a new cartoon character who didn't appear to belong to any particular religion or ethnicity. Expressing his concern that the original video focused on 'a religious Jew who is negatively portrayed as trying to cheat', ADC chair Dvir Abramovich said, 'While we are pleased that Monash University addressed our concerns quickly, it is troubling that this gratuitous depiction did not raise any red flags.'https://static.timesofisrael.com/ajn/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-18-at-6.00.18-pm.pngMEF Plays Key Role in Designation of Al Jazeera Subsidiary as Qatari Agent[14]The U.S. Department of Justice has ordered AJ+, a US-based subsidiary of Al Jazeera Media Network, to register as a foreign agent under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), because it is ""engaged in political activities within the United States ... on behalf of the Government of Qatar."" This culminates a multi-year effort by the Middle East Forum to counter Qatar's toxic influence campaign in the U.S. through its media arm. For example, Al Jazeera had 175 staffers in the U.S. Capitol in 2016, according to the Congressional Directory; in contrast, the New York Times had only 43. Qatar is a malign Islamist influence across the globe. In the Middle East, it is at odds with moderate Sunni states and finances Palestinian rejectionism. In the United States, the Qatar Foundation invests millions in schools and universities, using curricula that encourag anti-Americanism and hatred of Jews. In response, MEF's Counter-Qatar Team launched a Counter-Qatar Campaign. In 2018, President Trump signed the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that includes Forum-supported language requiring foreign-owned media outlets to report on their funding by ""foreign principals.""Indy fails to correct false claim Israel was rebuked by UN Security Council[15]It's been ten days since our complaint to the Independent, but editors still haven't corrected a false claim that the UN Security Council condemned Israel over the eviction of Bedouins from an encampment in the Jordan Valley. Here's the relevant sentence in the Indy article ('UN condemns Israel over 'grave breach' of international law after biggest demolition of Palestinian homes in decade, Nov. 9):Israel has been rebuked by the United Nations for carrying out widespread demolition of Palestinian homes, the largest in the occupied West Bank for more than a decade. the security council are calling the demolition a 'grave breach' of the Fourth Geneva Convention - international law that protects civilian populations in occupied territories.However, there was no UN Security Council resolution condemning the eviction. Nor was there even a UN General Assembly resolution criticising Jerusalem. The criticism came merely from a UN spokesperson.Anti-Jewish Discrimination 'Totally Unacceptable,' European Parliament President Tells Top Rabbinical Group[16]In remarks to the Conference of European Rabbis (CER) on Wednesday, European Parliament President David Sassoli urged unity in the fight against religious discrimination. 'We need to invest in greater equality and justice. Too many of our cities are stained with blood,' Sassoli said, referring to recent terrorist incidents in France and Austria. 'These tragic events remind us once again that the health and economic crisis is not the only crisis that we need to address.' 'Every attack is an attack on our values,' he added. 'We need to work more for the safety of our Jewish communities. Feelings of discrimination against the Jewish people continues to linger on and this is totally unacceptable.' 'The European Union must set an example to those who want to defy us. Freedom of religion is a founding value of Europe. The contribution of the Jewish people is the contribution to the greater good of Europe,' Sassoli concluded. Sassoli's remarks were made at CER's winter Standing Committee meeting, held on Zoom due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.Swastikas carved into Jewish headstones, memorials daubed with paint in Germany[17]Amid a recent spate of incidents against Jewish targets in Germany, swastikas were etched into headstones at a cemetery. The vandalism discovered this week in Haren, a northwestern town about 220 miles (354 kilometers) west of Berlin, is being treated as an anti-Semitic hate crime by police, the dpa news agency reported Tuesday. There are no suspects in custody. Separately on Monday, unidentified individuals in Chemnitz, 120 miles (193 kilometers) south of Berlin, spray-painted a swastika in purple on memorial Stolperstein, or 'stumbling stones' - brass street tiles that were placed at the former homes of Holocaust victims to commemorate them. 'We have had similar incidents when stumbling blocks were damaged or even cemented over,' a local politician, Katharina Weyandt, told the Tag24 news site. On Sunday, red paint was poured over other memorial cobblestones in Eilenburg, a city located 40 miles (64 kilometers) north of Chemnitz, Tag24 reported. In Ukraine, an incident involving Nazi symbols and Jewish sites was recorded in Uzhhorod, in the southwest. Swastikas were etched into the walls of a former synagogue building and a Celtic cross was spray-painted on it. Israeli start-ups in New York raised more than $1 billion during COVID-19[18]While the world economy has been heavily hurt by the coronavirus pandemic, it seems that New York-based Israelis start-ups were mostly spared. Indeed, no less than $1 billion was raised by them during the COVID-19 crisis, according to Israel Mapped in NY, an interactive map created by Israeli entrepreneur Guy Franklin in 2013, listing about 350 Israeli start-ups currently operating in New York City. Operating for seven years now, and listing only 60 when the platform was launched in 2013 compared to almost six times as many today, the map is revealing what the hottest trends and sectors are. Between 2013 and 2017, Video, Adtech and B2C were the hot sectors, but since 2018 the focus shifted to Cyber, Fintech, Big Data &#38; Analytics and B2B companies, along with Proptech, another thriving sector of tech applied to real estate, reported Calcalist. The interactive map features all the start-ups in which at least one of the founders is Israeli and has a team in New York. Alongside a detailed list of companies and their fields of activities, the map also displays relevant local investors, Israeli investors that operate in New York and accelerators, according to Calcalist. With new 'elegant chemo,' Israeli scientists edit genome to destroy cancer DNA[19]Israeli scientists say they have destroyed cancerous cells in mice with a method so pinpointed it's as if 'tiny scissors' were being used to target only affected cells, while leaving everything around them intact. 'This is the first study in the world to prove that the CRISPR genome editing system, which works by cutting DNA, can effectively be used to treat cancer in an animal,' said Prof. Dan Peer, a cancer expert from Tel Aviv University, after his peer-reviewed research was published in the Science Advances journal. 'There are no side effects, and we believe that a cancer cell treated in this way will never become active again.' He added: 'This technology can extend the life expectancy of cancer patients and we hope, one day, cure the disease.' He told The Times of Israel: 'If we can use this technology, then within three treatments we can destroy a tumor. This technology can physically cut the DNA in cancerous cells, and those cells will not survive.' Peer called it 'a more elegant chemotherapy' and said he dreams that it will replace that treatment, which can take a drastic toll on cancer patients because it is administered to the whole body. The research uses genome editing technology that is currently used only for rare diseases and only on cells that are removed from the body. It has been adapted to edit — or 'delete' — cancer cells. Washington Wizards take Israel's Deni Avdija as 9th pick in NBA draft[20]Israeli teenager Deni Avdija was taken by the Washington Wizards with the No. 9 overall pick in the NBA draft Wednesday night, becoming the first top-10 NBA draft pick from Israel. 'For me just to represent my country and to make history, that's a blessing,' Avdija said from Tel Aviv during a video conference with reporters Wednesday. 'I have the whole nation behind me. I hope I'm going to represent well.' As for the idea of inspiring young Israelis to pursue basketball, he said: 'I'm just glad they have somebody to look at and learn (from) — and just be motivated to see that us being a small country doesn't mean that we can't do big things.' The 6-foot-9, 225-pound Avdija then kissed his mother Sharon and father Zufer Avdija, who played for the Yugoslavian national team and later moved to Israel, where he played professionally for a number of Israeli clubs. Snoop Dogg teams up with SodaStream to help save the environment[21]The Israeli subsidiary of PepsiCo, SodaStream, decided to employ the talents of rapper Snoop Dogg to explain how the ""small things,"" such as switching to reusable bottles, can make a large impact on reducing a person's carbon footprint with regard to plastic waste. Accompanied by his ""nearly extinct friend,"" a sea turtle sporting an Israeli accent, Snoop Dogg noted that ""smalls things"" are the most meaningful, adding that amid the coronavirus pandemic the rapper would be dialing back his normally lavish lifestyle to enjoy the little things in life, such as dinner with the family instead of a big holiday party, and in lieu of his family's culinary trip, they would be opting for a little baking right at home. The change in lifestyle ties in with the message of the advertisement: that using the SodaStream home carbonated sparkling water system and its multi-use bottle can help avoid the disposal of countless single-use plastic bottles every year, and even save countless marine critters in the process. ""I don't need to start a nature relief fund to help save the planet from plastic waste,"" Snoop Dogg says in the commercial as he starts up his personal Sodastream system. ""I simply enjoy fresh sparkling water with a nearly extinct friend."" ""Think small, baby,"" said Snoop Dogg. To which the sea turtle replied, ""love you, brother."" ""By the way, one SodaStream bottle can save..."" Snoop Dogg said as he begins to veer off, to which the sea turtle added: ""1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... I don't know, thousands?"" ""Yeah thousands of single use plastic bottles,"" Snoop Dogg added. ""So who's thinking small now? Gotcha. I just saved the planet."" Play Video[22]Israel Philharmonic to host virtual pre-Hanukkah global music celebration[23]American Friends of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra and the Israel Philharmonic Foundation will premiere the ""Israel Philharmonic Pre-Hanukkah Global Celebration,"" a multidisciplinary program of instrumental performances and behind-the-scenes interviews, coupled with powerful messages of hope. The Dec. 6 event will stream internationally, free of charge, to bring music and holiday light from Israel's world-class Philharmonic to audiences around the world amid the global coronavirus pandemic. The event will weave together word and song, featuring Academy Award-winning composer Hans Zimmer; Grammy and Tony Award-winning actress and singer Bette Midler; actress and star of the TV series ""Fauda"" Ronalee Shimon; actress and model Dar Zuzovsky; music manager Kenny Hamilton; and other special guests. The Israel Philharmonic and its conductor, Lahav Shani, will perform pieces from Zimmer's acclaimed works. ""The Israel Philharmonic is a shining light for humanitarian principles, artistic freedom and the tireless pursuit of excellence - and for continuing to provide accessible, inspiring digital musical content despite the pandemic,"" said Danielle Ames Spivak, AFIPO executive vice president and CEO. Tali Gottlieb, Israel Philharmonic Foundation executive director, said ""2020 has been an extremely difficult year. We are making every effort to assist the philharmonic, and I am moved by the heartwarming response of its friends in Israel and throughout the world. In an end-of-the-year effort and in light of the exceptional success of our Global Gala this past June, which was viewed by more than 500,000 people worldwide, I hope this event will provide the support it needs to grapple with the enormous challenges still ahead."" Registration is free. Donations will offset critical Philharmonic revenue losses due to forced closures due to the ongoing pandemic.

The Dow Jones rose 1.3%, or 389 points, at the news. The stocks of airline and cruise companies saw some of the largest gains, along with many banks. Massachusetts-based Moderna is the second company to announce an effective vaccine, following Pfizer earlier this month. While the company's announcement of the vaccine itself was enough to give the market the boost, traders were apparently also excited that Moderna's vaccine remains stable in a regular refrigerator for up to 30 days and can be stored for up to six months below freezing.[88] Anti-Trump Dominion Voting Systems Security Chief Was Participating in Antifa Calls, Posted Antifa Manifesto Letter to Trump Online[89] In a stunning interview conducted by Michelle Malkin, Joe Oltmann, FEC (Faith Education Commerce) United founder, reveals how he infiltrated Antifa and how during a conversation with Antifa members, he discovered 'Eric from Dominion' was allegedly part of the chat during the week of September 27, 2020. Oltmann explained that 'Eric' was telling the Antifa members they needed to 'keep up the pressure.' When one of the caller's asked, 'Who's Eric?' someone answered, 'Eric, he's the Dominion guy.' Oltmann said that as the conversation continued, someone asked, 'What are we gonna do if F***ing Trump wins?' Oltmann paraphrased how Eric (the Dominion guy) responded, 'Don't worry about the election, Trump's not gonna win. I made f***ing sure of that!' Oltmann began digging into Eric Coomer, trying to find anything he could about him. Oltmann finally hit gold when he was able to (legally) access what he claims is Dominion VP, Eric Coomer's Facebook page. What he found was stunning. Joe Oltmann said he never saw such hate and vitriol coming from someone who has a Ph.D. in Nuclear Physics. Oltmann explained to Malkin that Coomer actually re-posted the Antifa manifesto to President Trump on his Facebook page. The Gateway Pundit posted a copy of that Antifa letter to Trump in a previous report. Joe Oltmann was removed from Twitter this week. His tweets on Eric Coomer upset big tech. Oltman admits that by revealing this information about Coomer, he is putting himself in danger.[90] Apple's MacOS Caught Sending User Data to Apple Every Time an App is Opened[91] Last week, as Apple's servers were under stress from the downloads of its latest Mac operating system update, Big Sur, many Mac users were finding that they weren't able to open any apps on their laptops and desktops. It soon became apparent that when a user opens an app on Mac, Apple's own servers get pinged for authentication. Yet, with Apple's servers under heavy load, this couldn't take place and users were unable to open programs.[92] Biden Transition Team Says First Amendment is Flawed Because it Permits 'Hate Speech'[93] by Paul Craig Roberts I told you this would happen. No one is to be allowed to speak against the official explanations: www.rt.com/usa/506751-biden-propagandist-anti-free-speech/ Biden's transition team defines truth as hate speech. Truth is what the Democrat left, military/security complex, and presstitutes don't want spoken or written. 'All speech is not equal,' declared Biden transition leader Richard Stengal, a former presstitute for MSNBC. 'Truth' is reserved for what serves the anti-white leftwing of the Democrat Party, the allied military/security complex and global elite. This means that no Trump supporter speaks the truth and his/her hate speech must be silenced. Keith Olbermann's demand for the arrest of President Trump and Tucker Carlson of Fox News is the beginning. http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/keith-olbermann-calls-for-the-arrests-of-t rump-and-tucker-carlson The vote theft is the opening gun of a civil war in which white Americans will have to fight or be relegated to third class citizens. The 14th amendment is also dead. Trump Deplorables are no longer equal under the law. They are denied free speech, but all others have free speech to denounce white America more harshly than Nazis are reported to have denounced Jews. Antifa and Black Lives Matter have begun the Kristallnachts. Those who tell the truth are losing the protection of the US Constitution. Only liars are protected. The obviously stolen election is a coup against democracy and America. If the American legal system fails to stand up to a stolen election, unless white Americans submit to third class status, violence is our future.[94] BLM Activist Filmed Sucker-Punching Man is a Child Sex Offender Recently Released From Prison[95] A Black Lives Matter activist and registered child sex offender was arrested for allegedly sucker-punching a man and leaving him bloody in the streets after the 'Million MAGA March' in the capital on Saturday. 39-year-old Kenneth Wayne DeBerry, of Washington, DC, was charged with aggravated assault, disorderly conduct through inciting violence, and being a felon in possession of a gun. When the Metropolitan Police Department took DeBerry into custody, officers found a handgun on him. DeBerry was filmed in viral videos running up from behind an unidentified man and sucker punching him. The man collapsed on the ground unconscious while another anti-Trump protester kicked him. Another protester then stole his mobile phone.[96] California School District Bans 'To Kill a Mockingbird, ' 'Huckleberry Finn, ' Other Classic Novels[97] The Burbank Unified School District in California has banned several classic literary works that contain racial slurs. To Kill A Mockingbird and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn are two of the classics on the district's new list of banned books.[98] Chicago Shootings: 22 Shot, 1 Fatally in Weekend Violence Across City[99] CHICAGO — One person was killed and 21 others, including three minors, were injured in shootings across Chicago over the weekend.[100] CNN's Jake Tapper Says 'Christmas is Probably Not Gonna be Possible,' Citing Fears of Coronavirus Outbreaks[101] CNN host Jake Tapper said during a Sunday interview with Dr. Anthony Fauci that Christmas is 'probably not gonna be possible' due to concerns over rising COVID-19 cases and the potential of new outbreaks.[102] Conservatives Say Media Ignoring Attacks on Trump Supporters at DC MAGA March[103] Conservatives accused the media of turning a blind eye to violent attacks against Trump supporters at Saturday's 'MAGA Million March' in Washington, DC. 'The President's supporters have a right to peacefully rally supporting POTUS just like his opponents have that same right,' New York Rep. Lee Zeldin said on Twitter Saturday night. 'The physical assaults today by violent leftists targeting his supporters is abhorrent,' Zeldin said. 'The near total media blackout of the violence is terrible&#38; telling.'[104] Day of Reckoning Closing in on the Election Criminals[105] One can say just about anything but that doesn't make it true. Those perpetrating this fraud upon the American people — despite their dedicated support from the Hollywood whores, the boob tube yakking heads and Trump haters all claiming Biden is president-elect — the traitors behind the curtain have to be (expletive) bricks. We know five swing states are key along with NV where thousands of cheaters who no longer lived in that state voted anyway and sent back the mail in ballot. Cheaters like DNC precinct workers, stupidvisers and anyone else who has participated in committing election fraud. They are NOT Americans. There is no honor among them. They're liars and cheats who care nothing for the law as long Trump loses. Nor do they care about open, honest and fair elections. I would say shame on them but they have no shame. Not ballot counters, election board members and all the way up the food chain. Americans who believe in freedom and liberty and cherish all who died to bring us the right to vote do NOT do what's being done to Donald Trump. When they look in the mirror, I have no doubt they think how righteous they are but in reality, they are filthy, dirty traitors to our republic Lin Wood Files Lawsuit Challenging Georgia's Secretary of State's Dark Unconstitutional Agreement with Hillary Attorney Marc Elias (If you're unfamiliar with Lin Wood, he is a fearless attorney who wins; look up his bio on line.) Wood doesn't make huff and puff statements; he's always dead serious and true to his word over the decades: 'Since I delivered these remarks on November 6, I have seen overwhelming evidence that massive fraud was in the computer voting system in addition to mail ballots. They will not get away with it.' Trump's Bulldog Attorney Lin Wood: 'Soon people will be going to prison. Lots of people' Short video — it's called evidence: Kayleigh Mcenany Says She Has PA Secretary Of State Emails Telling Her Minions In Liberal Counties To 'Fix The Vote' — 'President Trump's press secretary, Kayleigh Mcenany, told Sean Hannity last night the Trump admin has an email from Pennsylvania Secretary of State, Kathy Boockvar, telling 67 counties now they can go fix the ballots. 'The email was said to be written on the eve of election night, the same night President Trump jumped to a near 800k vote lead on Joe Biden.' Beyond outrageous. Last week Mcenany said Trump will make an announcement 'at the right time.'[106] Democrat Concedes House Race in New York and Another Race is Looking Good for the GOP (Update: Another Concession)[107] The NY Times results page for House races is not very useful at this point. There are two races in which Democrats have conceded the race but the Times still hasn't updated the page. I believe that's because they are following AP calls and the AP hasn't called those races. But again, the Democrats have conceded so, barring some unexpected change, these races are over.[108] 'Designed to Rig Elections': Sidney Powell Tells Bartiromo That Trump Team's Evidence Will 'Overturn' Multiple States[109] Attorney Sidney Powell is on Trump's legal team for the election fight, and she appeared on 'Sunday Morning Futures' today for an explosive interview with Maria Bartiromo in which she made certainly some of the boldest claims so far by the Trump team. She began talking about a particular individual: Peter Neffinger. He is 'president and on the board of directors of Smartmatic. And it just so happens he's on Mr. Biden's presidential transition team, that's going to be non-existent, because we're fixing to overturn the results of the election in multiple states,' claimed Powell. And that was just to start. She connected Neffinger to the software she said was used to alter or remove votes in some way. 'President Trump won by not just hundreds of thousands of votes, but by millions of votes that were shifted by this software that was designed expressly for that purpose,' she told Bartiromo. 'We have sworn witness testimony of why the software was designed. It was designed to rig elections.' 'They did this on purpose, it was calculated, they've done it before. We have evidence from 2016 in California, we have so much evidence I feel like it's coming in through a firehose,' she continued. [Comment: She was the one that got General Flynn exonerated from the false verdict.][110] Do You Trust Our Voting Systems?[111] From the day after the election, the press/media (P/M) have demanded that President Trump concede. It did not matter that in 2000, it took Al Gore 36 days to concede on December 13 More than any other company, Dominion Voting Systems was used in 28 states by 40% of the total American voting public, including battleground states Pennsylvania, Georgia, Wisconsin, Nevada, Minnesota and Arizona. And it did not matter to the P/M that the county clerk, Sheryl Guy, in Antrim County, MI reported that a tabulating glitch by Dominion's software had caused 6000 votes for Republicans to be switched to Democrats. It also did not matter that machines manufactured by Dominion contained components made in China. Also not arousing the curiosity of the P/M was the fact that Bloomberg News reported that Dominion 'hireda high-powered firm that includes a longtime aide to Speaker Nancy PelosiDominion's first-ever lobbying firm is Brownstein Farber Hyack and Schreck. Nadeam Elshami, Pelosi's former chief of staff, is one of the lobbyists on the account.' [Link] And completely unsuspicious to the P/M was the fact that The Washington Post reported in 2014 that Dominion was listed as a $25,000 to $50,000 donor to the Clinton Foundation! [Link] According to Politico, in Spalding County, GA, the Board of Elections supervisor, Marcia Ridley, said the companies 'uploaded something last night, which is not normal, and it caused a glitch. That is something that they don't ever do. I've never seen them update anything the day before the election.' [Comment: The software running Dominion machines is also used by other machine manufacturers.][112] Dominion Engineer Told Antifa He'd 'Made Sure' Trump Wouldn't Win, Report Says[113] Dominion's top engineer told Antifa he'd 'made f***ing sure' Trump wouldn't win Dominion's top engineer assured Antifa activists that he had 'made f**king sure' that President Donald Trump wouldn't win the presidential race, according to reports. Dominion Voting Systems' Vice President of U.S. Engineering Eric Coomer allegedly spoke with Antifa members on conference calls and reportedly assured the other participants by saying: 'Don't worry about the election, Trump's not gonna win. I made f**king sure of that!' Dominion Voting Systems is one of the largest voting technology companies in the United States.[114] Dominion Voting Systems Officer of Strategy and Security Eric Coomer Admitted in 2016 Vendors and Election Officials Have Access to Manipulate the Vote[115] Dr. Eric Coomer who is responsible for the strategy and Security of Dominion Voting Systems at Dominion Voting Systems. But if you search the company's profile Eric Coomer has since been removed from their page of directors. In 2016 Coomer told the Illinois States Board of Elections that it was possible to bypass election systems software.[116] Dr. Fauci Says Masks, Distancing Should Continue Even After Coronavirus Vaccine[117] Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday that even after the new COVID-19 vaccine is widely available, Americans should not plan on abandoning mitigating practices like masks and social distancing.[118] Exclusive: How a Philly Mob Boss Stole the Election — and Why He May Flip on Joe Biden[119] The innermost circles of the American mafia are abuzz. The Boss of the Philly mob — 'Skinny Joey' Merlino — is taking a victory strut, hobnobbing around the highest echelons of old-time mafia folk, mostly in Florida, describing what may have been the heist of the century: the 2020 presidential election. The feat is drawing praise from far-flung corners of the Italian American business community, which sees the thanks of a grateful administration as key to the revival of the community's political influence. But an associate says that Merlino might just be willing to flip on Joe Biden and the Pennsylvania political operatives who ordered up some 300,000 election ballots marked for Biden. The source alleges that Merlino and a lean team of associates manufactured those ballots at a rate of $10 per ballot — a whopping $3 million for three days of work. They were then packaged into non-descript cardboard boxes and dropped off outside the Philadelphia Convention Center.[120] Exclusive: Suspect Filmed Beating Trump Supporters in DC is a Journalism Student[121] The Post Millennial has identified a Black Lives Matter protester and journalist filmed assaulting Trump-supporters after the 'Million MAGA March' on Saturday in Washington, DC Brittany S. McAlister, 29, of Washington, DC, was caught on viral video assaulting at least two individuals. She is a third-year journalism student at Howard University and works as a freelance journalist.[122] Federal Judge Rules DHS Secretary Wolf Was Unlawfully Appointed, Invalidates DACA Suspension[123] Federal Judge Nicholas Garafus, appointed by Bill Clinton has ruled that the acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf was unlawfully appointed and has invalidated his suspension of the DACA program. Garafus concluded 'Wolf was not lawfully serving as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security under the HSA [Homeland Security Act] when he issued the Wolf Memorandum' that suspended DACA. Garaufis wrote in his ruling 'Based on the plain text of the operative order of succession, neither Mr. McAleenan nor, in turn, Mr. Wolf, possessed statutory authority to serve as Acting Secretary. Therefore the Wolf Memorandum was not an exercise of legal authority.'[124] Guilt by Partial Association: AirBnB Cancels Trump Supporter's Account, Citing 'Hate Group' Ties[125] In the lead-up to the Million MAGA March on Saturday, the home-sharing and vacation rental company Airbnb unceremoniously booted a Trump supporter from its platform because he offered to host members of a 'hate group' for the event. Airbnb canceled the man's reservation and deleted his account after Twitter users complained about his use of the platform. The man later clarified that he is not a member of the Proud Boys, an organization the far-left smear factory the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) has accused of being a hate group. The man in question, identified as Ronald Gaudier, offered to host march attendees in a public Telegram chat run by the Proud Boys.[126] It's a Coup. Just Say It![127] Say it, and it will start to sink in.[128] Joe Biden is a Sore Loser[129] Joe Biden lost the November 3 presidential election but is claiming to be 'president-elect' based on stolen votes. People magazine proclaims, 'It's time for America to unite,' featuring Joe Biden and the real presidential candidate, Kamala Harris. But as numerous observers have noted, Biden himself was asked whether he would declare victory only after the results were certified and he replied, 'yes.' He's a big liar. The Big Steal is underway. He doesn't want to wait for an honest vote count. In any case, under Supreme Court precedent, he can't win. His fraudulent vote-stealing effort makes any claim to a Biden-Harris victory to be completely false. Long-time Washington observer David Martin comments that 'The perps at the top of this criminal Democrat conspiracy have conned the American body politic into believing that Team Trump must peel away each and every electoral vote that was explicitly won through fraud and/or theft until Biden's total drops below 270.' In fact, he notes that under Supreme Court precedent, in the landmark case United States v. Throckmorton, 'fraud vitiates everything.' This means, according to the article at the 'Darkmoon' website, that when wholesale fraud, corruption, and criminality are employed to steal the presidential election, the victor automatically becomes the other presidential nominee with the greatest number of electoral votes. 'Hence,' it states, 'the prematurely and illegitimately declared Biden victory is now null and void under the law.'[130] John Bolton Says Stolen Election Claims 'Baseless; ' Trump Calls Him 'A Real Dope'[131] President Trump's former National Security Adviser John Bolton appeared on ABC News Sunday morning, suggesting that the Trump campaign's claims that the election had been stolen are 'baseless' and provide 'a character test for the Republican Party.'[132] John MacArthur's Church Cleared of COVID-19 'Outbreak' By L.A. County[133] Officials in Los Angeles County have lifted the requirements they placed on Grace Community Church, home of well-known pastor and theologian John MacArthur, after they had connected the church to three COVID-19 cases last month.[134] Michigan House Member Files to Impeach Governor Gretchen Whitmer[135] State Rep. Matt Maddock (R), who is well-known in Michigan as a pro-Trump solid conservative, announced tonight that he is filing the paperwork in the Michigan House to start impeachment proceedings against Democrat Governor Gretchen Whitmer! Whitmer has been repeatedly defying court orders limiting her COVID shutdown powers. And rumors swirl that another Whitmer Michigan shutdown is looming, perhaps starting on November 18 and lasting three weeks. A rumor that she would shut down the state on Friday came and went, though Whitmer held a very odd press conference where Whitmer and her advisors scolded family members not to hug on Thanksgiving. Maddock told the Gateway Pundit: 'Something had to be done. She's ruining this great state. Small businesses and most dine-in restaurants will be dead by the end of the year. She's caused the deaths of many vulnerable elderly people who died alone, scared, and pointlessly. This was long overdue,' Maddock said.[136] Michigan Gov. Whitmer Decrees New COVID Lockdown[137] Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared Sunday night that the state will effectively enter lockdown again, announcing several directives that must be adhered to by businesses and individuals. The Detroit News noted that 'The new policies will temporarily halt in-person instruction at high schools and colleges, dine-in service at restaurants and bars, and high school athletics as well as close some businesses, including movie theaters, bowling alleys and casinos.' Under the order, indoor residential gatherings will also be limited to two households at any one time.[138] More Than 82,000 People Have Filed Sexual Abuse Claims Against Boy Scouts[139] More than 82,000 claims of sexual abuse have now been filed against the Boy Scout of America, far surpassing claims made against other entities such as the Catholic church, according to lawyers. Under one legal coalition called Abused on Scouting, accusers aged 8 to 93 and from all 50 states have made claims against BSA. BSA filed for bankruptcy in February 2020 due to hundreds of sex-abuse lawsuits and declining membership due to its adoption of secular, politically-left stances such as allowing girls to join the boys-only program in the name of inclusivity.[140] Must See Video!

Data from the U.S. Postal Service indicate that since the pandemic began, 295,103 residents of New York have filed change of address requests. Accounting for more than one person per household indicates that New York has likely lost more than 300,000 residents.[146] Reparations Advocate Tapped for Biden Team[147] A reparations activist and a professor at the University of California is reportedly being tapped by the Biden team to be a member of his Department of Treasury agency review team.[148] Rumble Trends on Android as YouTube Censorship Drives Users to Alternative[149] Rumble, a video-sharing site similar to YouTube, has been attracting voices that are ditching YouTube because of censorship and has started to trend on the Google Play store. One of the influential figures currently posting content on Rumble is Dan Bongino. The political commentator, who has more than 3.7 million followers on Facebook, and has a stake in Rumble, is now redirecting people to watch his videos on Rumble, instead of his YouTube channel and is gaining many views.[150] The Second American Revolution Has Begun — Americans Are Ready to Fight![151] This brazen election theft by the globalist Democrats marks the beginning of the next chapter in the fight for freedom![152] Three More New York Sheriffs Say They Won't Enforce Cuomo's Thanksgiving Limit[153] Three more upstate New York sheriffs have announced their refusal to enforce the state's private gathering limit on Thanksgiving. In a scathing Facebook post on Saturday, Fulton County Sheriff Richard Giardino questioned the legality of Gov. Cuomo's newly instituted 10-person cap on parties and other gatherings in private residences. 'Frankly, I am not sure it could sustain a Constitutional challenge in Court for several reasons including your house is your castle,' the sheriff wrote in the Saturday post.[154] Trump COVID Adviser: 'the Only Way This Stops is if People Rise Up'[155] Dr. Scott Atlas, a leading member of President Trump's coronavirus task force, announced Sunday that 'The only way this stops is if people rise up.' Atlas was responding to the decree of a new lockdown by Michigan Democrat Governor Gretchen Whitmer. Atlas tweeted out a thread with Whitmer's announcement, and a graphic made by The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services highlighting what will be allowed to remain open and what will be forced to closed.[156] Trump Lawyer: 'We've Identified Mathematically the Exact Algorithm They've Used' To Steal Election[157] President Trump's lawyer Sidney Powell made bombshell claims in a Sunday interview, claiming that the campaign has uncovered hard evidence of machines switching votes from Trump to Biden in multiple states. Speaking to Fox News, Powell declared that 'We're getting ready to overturn election results in multiple states,' adding that 'I don't make comments without having the evidence to back it up.' Powell, a former federal prosecutor, said that a whistleblower has emerged with evidence that software in voting machines was 'rigged'.[158] Twitter Mob Demands Disney 'Cancel' Actress Gina Carano for Mocking Democrats[159] Star Wars: The Mandalorian star Gina Carano mocked the Democratic Party on Twitter this weekend, unleashing furious calls for Disney to fire the former MMA fighter.

The website, that has existed for ten years, has been denied hosting by WordPress.com, a hugely popular blogging service owned by Automattic — in yet another reminder of why reliance on corporate and centralized Silicon Valley services and platforms can be a mistake for any independent creator or publisher. According to the site, WordPress informed the site's owners that their content was 'incompatible' with the company's terms of use, giving them until December 2 to move the site to another hosting service.[164] 'The Great Reset' Trends on Twitter After Justin Trudeau Says Corona Pandemic Has Provided 'Opportunity'[165] 'The Great Reset' began trending on Twitter after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the coronavirus pandemic had provided an 'opportunity for a reset.' Trudeau made the comments during a United Nations video conference back in September, but they are only just receiving attention. 'Building back better means getting support to the most vulnerable while maintaining our momentum on reaching the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals)' said Trudeau.[166] Barbed Wired on the COVID Camp: Keean Bexte's Visit to Manitoba Quarantine Site[167] On the latest episode of Rebel Roundup, Keean Bexte called in to talk about a secret coronavirus camp, a retrofitted facility south of Portage la Prairie, Manitoba. Here's a bit of what Keean had to say: 'Now this camp, I want to reiterate — isn't on a contract right now with Justin Trudeau. 'But they did tell me that they would take any client who was referred to them by the Manitoba provincial government. 'They didn't say anything about it being voluntary'[168] Calgary ISIS Terrorist Allowed to Go Skiing With Girlfriend, Parole Board Rules[169] A convicted ISIS terrorist living in Calgary has been granted permission to take to the ski hills with his girlfriend. Only one year ago, Carlos Larmond was considered too dangerous for full release from his halfway house.[170] Canadian Accused of Fabricating Past as ISIS Executioner 'Abu Huzayfah' Appears in Court[171] A Canadian accused by the RCMP of falsely claiming he had been an ISIS executioner in Syria appeared in Ontario court on Monday to face a terrorism hoax charge. It was the first court appearance for Shehroze Chaudhry since his arrest on Sept. 25 on allegations he falsely portrayed himself as a former ISIS member living in Canada. His case was put over until Jan. 25. A 25-year-old employee at his family's Oakville, Ont., shawarma restaurant, Chaudhry was featured prominently in a popular U.S. podcast as 'Abu Huzayfah.' His widely publicized claims that he was living freely in the Toronto area despite having executed victims by stabbing them in the heart set off heated debate in the House of Commons. But four years after he began posting on social media about his past in ISIS, the RCMP accused him of making it up, invoking a rarely used 'hoax regarding terrorist activist' charge.[172] Dominion Voting Systems Has a History of Controversy in Canadian Elections[173] The United States should have checked with Canada before employing the scandal plagued Dominion Voting Systems (DVS) in the 2020 presidential elections. The more you dive into this company, the more you find how deeply entrenched they are in every part of the 'democratic' traditions of North America. It seems that every election they are involved in, claims of voter fraud follow. Despite that, election officials in both Canada and the United States continue to trust them — for better or worse. Sure, they might have donated $50,000 to the Clinton Foundation, but hey — who cares? Well, you should. DVS is used in every single one of Georgia's 159 counties, and they are used in many of the swing states that just sent their Electoral votes to Joe Biden. Dominion Voting is not just throwing American democracy into disrepute, they have done that with Canadian elections for years and years, but nobody in Canada, much less the US, has bothered to take notes. The Canadian media is entirely complacent in covering this story.[174] Klaus Schwab: Great Reset Will 'Lead to a Fusion of Our Physical, Digital and Biological Identity'[175] Globalist Klaus Schwab made it clear that transhumanism is an integral part of 'The Great Reset' when he said that the fourth industrial revolution would 'lead to a fusion of our physical, digital and biological identity,' which in his book he clarifies is implantable microchips that can read your thoughts. As we highlighted earlier, 'The Great Reset' is attracting a deluge of fresh attention in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, which Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said was an 'opportunity for a reset.'[176] COVID Censorship: 80 Per Cent of Brits Back Criminalising 'Anti-Vax' Posts[177] The overwhelming majority of the British public is in favour of criminalising the dissemination of 'fake news' about vaccines, as the left-wing Labour Party has come out in favour of further speech restrictions in the UK under the pretext of the Chinese coronavirus. A survey of 2,000 Britons conducted by ORB International found that 80 per cent of the British public support the prosecution of those who share supposed misinformation online about vaccines.[178] Czech Court Cancels Mandatory Face Mask Rule; Ministry Has One Week to Fix Mistakes[179] Czechs will no longer have the duty to wear face masks to the extent currently required after a decision from the Municipal Court in Prague. The Municipal Court annulled an extraordinary measure by which the Ministry of Health extended the obligation to wear face masks in the Czech Republic from Oct. 21. According to the court's ruling, the Ministry did not sufficiently substantiate the reasons why such a duty are necessary. The court ruled that the measure would be revoked on Nov. 21, so the ministry had time to adopt new ones without issues, court spokeswoman Markta Puci added on Twitter.[180] Europe's Lax Security Aids Islamist Terrorists[181] The latest wave of Islamist-inspired terror attacks to strike Europe has yet again exposed lamentable flaws in the ability of European security agencies to provide adequate protection for their citizens. In all three instances — the attacks in Paris, Nice and Vienna — it has emerged that those held responsible for carrying out the attacks had links to global jihadi networks that went undetected by European security officials. Moreover, the ease with which some of those involved in the attacks were able to travel freely across the continent has once more raised concerns about Europe's lax border controls as defined by the European Union's Schengen Agreement, and the ability of radicalised jihadis to exploit them.[182] Forced Vaccination Law in Denmark Abandoned After Public Protests[183] A law in Denmark that would have given authorities the power to forcibly inject people with a coronavirus vaccine has been abandoned after nine days of public protests. The 'epidemic law' would have handed the Danish government the power to enact mandatory quarantine measures against anyone infected with a dangerous disease, but it was the part about vaccinations that caused the biggest uproar.[184] France: Muslims Threaten to Kill Socialist Mayor, Facebook Says the Threats Don't Violate Their Community Standards[185] A Socialist. What do you bet that Stphane Raffali believes that Islam is a religion of peace, that 'Islamophobia' is the real problem, and that 'refugees' are not dangerous, but in danger, and that only 'racists' oppose mass Muslim migration into France? Yet his flirting with violation of Sharia blasphemy laws by lionizing a man who was beheaded for a Muhammad cartoon got him death threats anyway. And Facebook refused to take down the threats, saying they didn't violate their community standards. Facebook is increasingly evil, and increasingly open about it. Imagine if a Muslim leader had received death threats; do you think Facebook would say that those threats violated their community standards? So do I. And not only would they take them down in a hot minute; the threats would also be the occasion for screaming international headlines and searching feature pieces about the increase of 'Islamophobia.' But this? Nothing. 'Essonne: the mayor of Ris-Orangis threatened with death after the tribute to Samuel Paty,' translated from 'Essonne: le maire de Ris-Orangis menac de mort apre's l'hommage Samuel Paty,' by Pauline Darvey and Bartolom Simon, Le Parisien, November 11, 2020 (thanks to Mason):[186] France: Terrorist Whose Attack Was Foiled by Holidaying U.S. Servicemen Goes on Trial[187] PARIS (AP) — An Islamic State operative goes on trial Monday in France on terror charges for swaggering bare-chested through a train in 2015 with an arsenal of weapons and shooting one passenger. He was brought down by three American vacationers in an electrifying capture that Clint Eastwood turned into a Hollywood thriller. The scene five years ago on the fast train from Amsterdam to Paris is the focus of the month-long trial of Ayoub El Khazzani, with testimony expected from the two U.S. servicemen and their friend, who have been hailed as heroes.[188] French Catholics Hold Protests Over Ban on Church Services During Lockdown[189] French Catholics protesting a ban on large church gatherings during a month-long partial lockdown held street prayers in several cities over the weekend. While places of worship remain open during the second nationwide lockdown, which began on October 30th, regular prayer services are banned. More than 300 worshippers gathered outside the cathedral in the south-western city of Bordeaux on Sunday to demand that mass be reinstated. Some said prayers or sang hymns, despite the gathering being billed as a protest, prompting the police to call in the organisers for questioning.[190] French Catholics Hold Open Air Mass to Protest COVID-19 Restrictions[191] NANTES, France — Catholics held an open air mass in the western French city of Nantes on Sunday to protest against COVID-19 restrictions, under which masses are banned in churches. Some Catholics also gathered by the Saint Louis Cathedral in Versailles, near Paris, but police banned a demonstration planned by Catholics in the capital. In Nantes, which is home to one of France's best-known cathedrals, dozens of people, wearing face masks, knelt down with umbrellas in pouring rain to pray in the central Graslin Square and to support calls for public masses to resume.[192] Germany: Gray Wolves — The Fascists Nobody Wants to Talk About[193] There's a gigantic, well-organized, extremely violent fascist group with tens of thousands of active members in Germany right now. And nobody notices. You'd think all the fascist-hunters would have sniffed it out by now, but it goes right by them as if these guys were invisible. Which is odd, because this group is not trying to hide, or pretending to be harmless. They're not shy about it, and it's not just talk. They have quite a record. They've been rampaging for decades, and if anything they're stronger now than they used to be. They're closely linked to CIA and Nazi groups; they're very busy beating, burning, and murdering minorities of all kinds, and boast quite openly about hating literally everyone who's not a member of their own ethnic group and sect, even suggesting that members go on 'hunting expeditions' against minorities which they'd already almost wiped out back in the 20th century. This group recently held massive, open rallies in the cities of Germany, and it's only in the last few years that the government has even attempted to ban the public symbols and salutes of this massive fascist group. There's something grotesquely comic about this. We have a swarm of fascist-spotters who've spent the last few decades waiting for fascism to emerge in Germany when it was marching around, shouting at the top of its lungs, beating minorities, celebrating genocide, and supporting ethnic cleansing right in front of their damn faces. I'm talking about the Gray Wolves . And I defy anyone to find a more successful, out-front, no-kidding, massive, effective, ruthless fascist organization anywhere in the world. They're adapting quickly, and even have their own fierce Wiki defenders. Here are a few highlights from their long, successful career:[194] German Government Hails Couch Potatoes as Heroes of Coronavirus Pandemic[195] The German federal government on Saturday released an online video praising an unexpected hero in the country's fight against the coronavirus: the couch potato. The ad, entitled '#specialheroes — Together against corona,' is a 1.35-minute video and calls on people in Germany to follow the honorable example of the modest couch potato citizen. A Twitter user has even posted an English translated version of the ad.[196] Germany: Cops Investigating False Bomb Threat Against Mosque Have Dog Wear Paw Covers to Avoid Offending[197] German authorities are ever solicitous of their growing and restive Muslim population, and so they're ready to act upon the otherwise univerally denied fact that Islam hates dogs: 'Once Gabriel promised the Prophet (that he would visit him, but Gabriel did not come) and later on he said, 'We, angels, do not enter a house which contains a picture or a dog.'' — Sahih Bukhari 4.54.50 'Abdullah (b. Umar) (Allah be pleased with them) reported: Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) ordered the killing of dogs and we would send (men) in Medina and its corners and we did not spare any dog that we did not kill, so much so that we killed the dog that accompanied the wet she-camel belonging to the people of the desert.' — Sahih Muslim 3811 'Ibn Mughaffal reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) ordered killing of the dogs, and then said: What about them, i. e. about other dogs? and then granted concession (to keep) the dog for hunting and the dog for (the security) of the herd, and said: When the dog licks the utensil, wash it seven times, and rub it with earth the eighth time.' — Sahih Muslim 551 Remember: opposing Sharia is 'bigoted' and 'racist.'

Police Break Up Baptism for Breaching Coronavirus Restrictions[199] British police busted up a baptism service on Sunday in London for breaching Prime Minister Boris Johnson's draconian lockdown restrictions. Police barred the Christan worshipers from entering into The Angel Church in Islington, stationing officers outside the entrance as well as parking two police vans and a car outside the evangelical church.[200] Head of Polish Catholic Church Calls for Coming Clean Over Sex Abuse Allegations[201] Asked to respond to allegations made against Pope John Paul II's close confidant Cardinal Stanislaw Dziwisz, PolishArchbishop Wojciech Polak told commercial news channel TVN24 that he had hopes that 'Christ would demand for there to be a cleansing' of the Church of its past. Liberal TVN24, in its film report entitled 'Don Stanislao', has alleged that Cardinal Dziwisz was involved in covering up sex abuse by priests all over the world, including in Poland. Archbishop Polak acknowledged that the system for investigating such allegations needs to be tighter and more diligent. He also referred to the words of Pope Francis who called for greater care and attention to be shown to the victims, which would help the Church show them respect and love while fighting the evil and crime that came from within Catholic institutions.[202] Macron Condemns Media Excusing Islamist Terror by Alleging French 'Racism and Islamophobia'[203] French president Emmanuel Macron has complained that the mainstream media appear to be 'legitimising' a spate of radical Islamic terror attacks against his country by claiming it is 'racist and Islamophobic'. France has suffered several high-profile terror attacks in recent months, including an attack on two people outside the former offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdowith a meat cleaver, the public beheading of a schoolteacher who showed caricatures of the Islamic prophet from the magazine during a class on freedom of expression, and the murder of three Christians at a church in Nice.[204] Populist Govts of Hungary, Poland Veto EU's Globalist Power Grab Budget[205] EU member states Hungary and Poland have followed through on their threat to block the continental power bloc's seven-year budget, after Brussels attempted to push it through with conditions the populist nations said were akin to 'political enslavement'. European Union rules mean that many significant decisions — including whether to approve the bloc's seven-yearly funding programmes — must be taken unanimously, with any single member state able to veto decisions. This safeguard was triggered on Monday by conservative-led Hungary and Poland, who blocked the progress of the €1.8 trillion (1.6 trillion, $2.1 trillion) 'Multiannual Financial Framework' (MFF) as an attack on national sovereignty.[206] Top Polish Bank: Polish Economy Coping Well With Second Wave of Coronavirus Pandemic[207] Poland's GDP has bounced back in the third quarter of 2020 and there are so far no signs of the economy being hit by the second wave of the pandemic, according to Poland's PKO BP bank. The bank points to data from Poland's Central Office of Statistics (GUS), which shows Poland's GDP in the third quarter was only down 1.6 percent on the equivalent period in 2019 whereas in the second quarter the GDP had fallen by 8.4 percent. Poland's state PKO BP bank reports that the third quarter saw an increase of 7.7 percent quarter-on-quarter, having suffered a fall of 9 percent in the second quarter.[208] UK Law Commission Victim-Blames After Terror Attacks, Calls for Mohammed Cartoons to be Banned[209] The Law Commission in the UK has suggested changes to the laws on hate crimes that would make so-called 'hate speech' like the Charlie Hebdo caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad criminalized. Critics have criticized the proposal as a suppression of free speech, some calling it 'the Scottish Hate Crime Bill on steroids.' The proposal of the Law Commission, an organization of lawyers in Wales and England, follows the recent terror attacks by Islamic extremists in France. The shocking proposal is a 533-page report that agrees with Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's statements that victim blame and claims that the current laws on hate speech in the UK are inadequate.[210] UK Police Restrict Baptism Service of Evangelical Church Defying Lockdown Orders[211] London police broke up a baptism service at a local church Sunday, forcing some parishioners out and preventing anyone from entering the building beyond the 15-person limited mandated under new lockdown orders.[212] UK: Boris Self-Isolating After COVID Contact, Despite Having Had it Already[213] Prime Minister Boris Johnson is self-isolating for two weeks after coming into contact with a Member of Parliament (MP) infected with COVID-19, despite having already fended off the Chinese virus earlier in the year. 'Hi folks, I've been instructed by our NHS Test &#38; Trace scheme to self-isolate for two weeks, after being in contact with someone with Covid-19,' the Tory leader announced on social media.[214] Watch: Police Fire Water Cannons at Antifa in Germany as They Try to Shut Down 'Fascist' Anti-Lockdown Demo[215] Police in Frankfurt, Germany fired water cannons at Antifa counterprotesters on Saturday as the far-left attempted to shut down an anti-lockdown rally against the government's Chinese coronavirus restrictions. Approximately 600 Querdenker (lateral thinker) protesters took to the streets of Frankfurt, calling for an end to what they termed the coronavirus 'dictatorship'.[216] EU is Extending Sanctions on Turkey for Its Illegal Drilling[217] by Thomas O. Falk In the ongoing dispute between Brussels and Ankara, the European Union has extended its sanctions against a Turkish company by one year. The sanctions were imposed due to Turkey drilling and conducting natural gas exploration in the Mediterranean. EU Sanctions on TPAO So far, the EU has only imposed sanctions once under this framework, when it constricted two officials of the legal upstream Turkish company TPAO into restrictive measures in relation to Turkey's 'unauthorized' drilling in front of Cyprus in February. An EU entry ban and asset freezes continue to apply to them. The sanctions were initially imposed on TPAO exploration manager Mehmet Ferruh Akalin and deputy exploration director Ali Coscun Namoglu at the end of February after unauthorized drilling activities outside the Republic of Cyprus. [][218] Iran Says 'Insult to a Prophet' Encourages Violence After Macron Defended Mohammed Cartoons[219] Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has warned that French President Emmanuel Macron is encouraging violence by defending cartoons of the prophet Mohammed. The French president has become entangled in accusations of Islamophobia and racism in the midst of a debate on freedom of expression and blasphemy in France. Macron took a traditionally secularist line by refusing to condemn those accused of blasphemy and promised to defend himself against conservative Islamic feelings.[220] Moldova Elects Pro-Western Politicians Maia Sandu as President[221] The pro-Europe economist and politician, 48-year-old Maia Sandu, won a clear victory over her Socialist, pro-Moscow opponent Igor Dodon in the second round of the presidential elections in the Republic of Moldova, Romanian news portal Ziare reports. With almost 90 percent of the votes counted, Sandu has a clear 56.28 percent lead over Dodon's 53.72 percent. The campaign and election were the latest chapters in the ongoing political battle whether Moldova should orient itself towards the European Union (as Sandu advocates along with others), or Moscow, which is the direction preferred by the country's Communist and Socialist parties.[222] Azerbaijan Vows to Protect Christian Churches as Many Flee[223] The president of Azerbaijan is promising that Christian churches will be protected when the strongly Muslim country takes possession of areas formerly controlled by Armenians, as residents burned down their homes and fled in cars and trucks ahead of Sunday's expected takeover.[224] Watch: Azerbaijani Soldier Screams 'Allahu Akbar' While Standing Atop a Desecrated Church in Occupied Territory in Armenia[225] A video has emerged on social media platforms showing a suspected Azerbaijani soldier or Syrian mercenary screaming 'Allahu Akbar' (God is Greater) while standing on the top of a chapel in Karabakh in Armenia. It is believed that the video was filmed recently. Others were heard repeating Allahu Akbar after him. Armenian Church destroyed Just a day before the said video was released, photos of a desecrated church in Armenia had appeared online. The Church was located in the strategic city of Shushi in the Karabakh region. Azerbaijan's leadership had promised that they would protect the Armenian people of Karabakh. They also stated that they would preserve the culture and heritage of the community. However, the recent desecration of churches has made it clear that the Baku administration is not interested in protecting these sites.[226] Kali Puja Inauguration: Bangladesh Star Cricket Player Threatened to be Killed by a Quran Fanatic[227] A Quran follower threatens to kill BD Star Cricketer Shakib Al Hasan on Facebook live for attending Kali Puja inauguration in Kolkata. Jadugopal Das | HENB | Dhaka | Nov 16, 2020:: A fanatic Quran follower has threatened to kill ace all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan on a Facebook live video uploaded on November 15 after 12am. The man, Mohsin Talukdar, is from Talukdarpara area in Shahpur under Sylhet Sadar upazila. He went live from his personal account at 12:07am and was seen brandishing a sharp weapon — threatening the star cricket all rounder Shakib for inaugurating a Kali puja mandap in India's Kolkata on Thursday. In the video, Mohsin mentioned his name and said that Shakib has 'hurt religious sentiments of Muslims by inaugurating a puja mandap and he must be killed'. Later at 6:04am, Mohsin went live again where he apologised for 'being rude' in the previous video and urged Shakib to repent for 'hurting Muslims'. In the second video, he states that he is sorry for being rude — not under pressure from anyone — and he still stands by his words[228][229] Pakistan: Thousands-Strong Anti-France Rally Goes 24 Hours[230] Thousands of supporters of Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), an Islamist group in Pakistan, staged a sit-in and march from neighboring Rawalpindi to the capital that spanned overnight and into the morning hours of Monday, demanding justice against French President Emmanuel Macron. Radical Islamists around the world have organized protests, mobs, and effigy burningsand beheadings of Macron in response to the French president honoring a schoolteacher beheaded in a Paris suburb last month. Samuel Paty had shown his students images of cartoons of Muhammad, a religious figure Muslims consider a prophet, published in the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. Radical Muslims staged a massacre in response to the images at the headquarters of Charlie Hebdo in 2015.[231] Citizens in China Are Blocked From Talking About Possible Voter Fraud in the US[232] Although China keeps internet users in the mainland under a strict and effective wall of censorship preventing them from accessing many foreign, mostly western sources of information, people still find a way around it. Those who do and take an interest in US politics are learning about the latest developments around the presidential election, including allegations of election rigging on a scale that brings into question the legitimacy of the vote.[233] Over 370 Christians in China Arrested After Online Surveillance[234] Members of the Church of Almighty God (CAG), a religious organization active in China whose beliefs are based on the Christian Bible, continue to be persecuted by the country's authorities. Bitter Winter, monitoring religious liberty and human rights in China, explains that at least 370 believers of this group, which is said to be one of the most persecuted religious organizations in China, have been placed under arrest in several provinces in the latest round of raids that took place over several months, from June until October.[235] Report: China Using Eugenic Abortions to 'Improve the Quality of the Population'[236] The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has underscored the eugenic aims of its population policy in its latest five-year plan, highlighting the need to cull out undesirable elements and encourage breeding of superior subjects. While China's population has long suffered from sex-selective abortions, with countless families aborting baby girls in the hope of having a boy under the draconian one-child policy (later modified to a two-child policy), the new thrust of the CCP's population plan is to reduce racially inferior citizens and promote the more preferable ethnic element.[237] Muslim Preacher Says One Who Insults Muhammad 'Is to be Put to the Sword. We Ask Allah to Destroy These People.'[238] 'Indeed, those who abuse Allah and His Messenger — Allah has cursed them in this world and the Hereafter and prepared for them a humiliating punishment.' That's Qur'an 33:57. How will they be cursed in this world? A prayer to Allah to 'destroy these people' is not just a request directed to the deity. The Qur'an explicitly says that Allah will punish people by the hands of the believers: 'Fight them; Allah will punish them by your hands and will disgrace them and give you victory over them and satisfy the breasts of a believing people, and remove the fury in the believers' hearts.' (9:14-15) Thus Hadad may be issuing a call to action to believers who think it incumbent upon themselves to heed this Qur'anic directive and become instruments of Allah's wrath. In Australia. What are the chances that Hadad and his hearers will become loyal, stable, productive members of secular Australian society?

Authorities targeted known hiding places for migrants, including the harbor and local shelters, arresting 16 foreign suspects illegally present in Belgium. 'Such actions as those on Tuesday evening will certainly be repeated,' Mayor Dirk De Fauw told local media. 'On the one hand to be able to close the premises where transmigrants reside, but also to check on the basis of fingerprints whether the transmigrants can be linked to criminal offenses.'[241] Germany: Muslim Migrant Admits He Faked Right-Wing Attack on Himself, Leftists Demonstrate Anyway[242] Actual 'right-wing hate crimes' against Muslim migrants are so thin on the ground that they have to be invented in order to shore up the leftist narrative. '19-year-old invents right-wing extremist attack in Bielefeld — the left scene demonstrates anyway: Iranian scratched a swastika into his own skin,' translated from '19-Jhriger erfindet rechtsextremen Angriff in Bielefeld — linke Szene demonstriert trotzdem: Iraner hat sich Hakenkreuz selbst in die Haut geritzt,' Westfalen-Blatt, November 14, 2020 (thanks to Medforth).[243] Hungary is Treated Like 'A Black Sheep Only Because of Its Rejection of Immigration', Says Justice Minister Varga[244] The ongoing attempt to link European Union funding to loosely defined rule of law criteria is a thinly veiled attack on countries like Hungary and Poland that embrace conservative positions on migration, multiculturalism and Christian values, Hungarian Justice Minister Judit Varga said in an interview with German daily newspaper Die Welt. In the interview, Varga described Hungary as being treated like 'a black sheep only because of its rejection of immigration' — with the immigration issue now of fundamental importance for an EU that increasingly embraces open borders orthodoxy and a liberal migration policy despite a wave of terror attacks and rising crime tied to uncontrolled mass migration.[245] Only 17% of Canadians Support Liberal Immigration Plan[246] Canadians are questioning the government's intent to bring in over 1.23 million immigrants into Canada by 2023 in the midst of a global pandemic. According to a recent poll by Bloomberg, only 17% of Canadians approved of accepting more immigrants. 36.3% of those polled believed Canada should lessen the number of immigrants, and 40.1% of respondents believed Canada should maintain the same immigration levels as previous years.[247] Suspected Islamist Works in the German Office for Migration and Refugees, The Ministry Confirms[248] The Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) employs a person whom the security authorities consider to be an Islamist, the DPA agency reported, referring to the response of the German Ministry of the Interior, which was interpellated by left-wing MPs from the Left party (Die Linke). The ministry has confirmed that the suspected Islamist is employed by the Office of Migration and Refugees. 'The federal government is aware of a specific suspicious case in the field of Islamism and Islamist terrorism,' the reply said. As the case has not yet been closed, the ministry declined to provide any details.[249] Terrorism Threat in Hungary Lower Than Austria, Germany and France Due to Fewer Muslim Migrants, Says Hungarian Security Expert[250] Hungary's terror threat level remains unchanged despite a wave of Islamic attacks in France and Austria and it much to do with the fact that Hungary never accepted mass migration from Muslim countries, Hungarian security policy expert Georg Spöttle told German-language news portal Ungarn Heute (Hungary Today) in an interview. Despite Hungary's low threat level, the country is actively working to aid its neighbors. That is why following the terrorist attack in Vienna, the Hungarian Anti-Terrorism Unit (TEK) immediately provided administrative assistance and worked with the police and the military to secure the border, Spöttle said.[251] Lauded ACLU Lawyer Wants to Stop the Circulation of Book That Documents Kids Who Regret Transitioning[252] For an organization that refers to itself as an 'ongoing champion of free expression,' an American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) lawyer has now chosen a strange hill to die on: stopping the circulation of books and ideas. The statement came from Chase Strangio, a lawyer with the nonprofit group, and was made in the context of the lawyer being transgender and their harsh criticism of a book written by Abigail Shrier on the rise of transgender transitioning and regret of some of those who transitioned at an early age.[253] New Twitter Meme Shows How 'Fact Checking' Has Become a Joke[254] The rise of 'fact-checkers' in recent years, as big social media companies struggle to appease critics who say they are allowing too much freedom on their platforms, has been one of the more fascinating developments in the mess created by politics interfering in tech, and tech interfering in politics. Another fascinating rise to prominence has been that of memes as powerful tools of summing up big and complex messages into a single picture and a few words. Now these two worlds are colliding in a new Twitter meme making fun of fact-checking, that has gone viral.[255] Prominent Leftist YouTube Calls for the Legalization of Child Pornography[256] In a widely-circulated video, prominent leftist YouTube streamer Vaush reiterated his argument to legalize child pornography. 'I still don't care. I still think that zoophile porn—like drawn stuff—it should be 100 percent legal,' the self-styled 'libertarian socialist' stated at first. 'In fact, and this is going to be a real hot take, I had to hear a convincing moral or legal argument as to why possession of child pornography should be illegal,' Vaush continued, emphasizing 'actual child pornography.' 'How does this guy 'Vaush' have such a massive audience on YouTube when he's calling for the legalization of child porn?' The Post Millennial's Ian Miles Cheong questioned on Twitter. Vaush possesses almost 300,000 subscribers on YouTube and is considered by peers to be the apex of careerist grifters on the platform's political side.[257] [ 1]: http://hinduexistence.org/ [ 2]:

234,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1251/Files (250).DOCX","Business Wire",2020-09-07,"596 words",NA,NA,NA,"The Interfaith Alliance for Safer Communities Hosted A Roundtable Event - Covid-19: Faith as a Moral Framework for our Communities",FALSE,"The Interfaith Alliance for Safer Communities (IAFSC), an NGO established to empower faith leaders to work for the safety and security of communities, has held a successful online interfaith roundtable event with representation from 50 participants representing 7 faiths from 18 countries.
Speaking about the event, Dr. Vinu Aram (Director of Shanti Ashram and Co-Moderator of Religions for Peace) said, ""I want to thank the Interfaith Alliance for Safer Communities for this meeting today. The work of the Interfaith Alliance is so important: in the disruption of the ways we worked together as communities during Covid-19, we have found that children have become more vulnerable... While every nation is trying to find its own solution, those of us who work with children have to be greater advocates for their cause.""
Chief Executive of the IAFSC, Dana Humaid, said ""Faith has rarely been more important or powerful than in the current crisis. The IAFSC hosted this event in order to allow discussion and facilitate knowledge-sharing from different religions and communities on a global scale. Faith leaders have the power to assist their communities, to be advocates for those in need, to make a difference and offer comfort and also to try and reduce the suffering of people under their watch.""
The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has been unprecedented in modern times, and has had a significant impact on the physical, mental and spiritual wellbeing of our communities. Millions have lost their jobs and are facing struggles such as hunger and homelessness. This pandemic has had unforeseen consequences as well, such as a surge in the cases of child sexual abuse as well as an increase in hate crimes based on race and religion.
Key Outcomes
The roundtable discussions aimed to address the most significant problems being faced by our communities today.
Supporting those most impacted by coronavirus in rebuilding their lives
We are all impacted by this pandemic, we are not all affected the same way.
The role of faith and faith leaders is to build, promote and invigorate a spirit of resilience.
When faith leaders aren't able to contact their community and provide them with help or assistance in a difficult time, it is a challenge for everyone in the community.
Faith leaders have been taking on the bulk of the work in some communities.
We need to be careful of our blind spots, we cannot create a situation in which we overlook other communities that now need our help, such as those that may not be considered traditionally vulnerable sectors of society.
Protecting the digital dignity of children and supporting the victims and their families
Faith leaders can be champions in leading the prevention of sexual exploitation.
It is important to base our responses on data and evidence and go from there.
No one is an expert in the prevention of exploitation. Community is key.
We need to increase budgets for social and health services.
Family and family stability are also vital.
Education, mobilization, support and universal healthcare are all necessary in improving our communities.

MINNEAPOLIS — Minnesota prosecutors acknowledged Wednesday that a police officer had his knee on George Floyd’s neck for 7 minutes, 46 seconds — not the 8:46 that has become a global symbol of police brutality.
The initial complaint alleges Derek Chauvin “had his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds in total. Two minutes and 53 seconds of this was after Mr. Floyd was non-responsive.” But timestamps cited in the document’s description of the incident, much of which was caught on video, showed Chauvin had his knee on Floyd for 7 minutes, 46 seconds, including 1 minute, 53 seconds after Floyd appeared to stop breathing.
Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman’s office said in a statement that “these kinds of technical matters” can be handled in a future amendment to the criminal case if it becomes necessary.
The Associated Press began asking about the error the day after the initial charges were filed, but prosecutors had repeatedly declined to address it as their 8 minutes and 46 seconds began to be used by protesters around the globe for its symbolism.

CHARLESTON, W.Va. — A private college in West Virginia said Wednesday it is removing the name of the late U.S. Sen. Robert C. Byrd from its health center, saying his name had caused “divisiveness and pain” without explicitly noting his complicated past on racial matters.
Byrd was a member of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1940s but subsequently denounced the organization. He served in the Senate for 51 years and died in 2010 at age 92.
Bethany College President Tamara Rodenberg said on the school’s website that Byrd’s name will be removed from the college’s Robert C. Byrd Health Center “to demonstrate Bethany College’s capacity to change, to listen, and to learn.”
Bethany’s statement did not specifically mention Byrd’s past ties to the Klan.
“Our lives are marked by decisions, by actions, and by grace, and today we embrace all three in a tangible, visible way at our beloved Bethany College,” Rodenberg wrote.
Bethany College’s statement said the college recognized in the past few weeks that Byrd’s name attached to the health center “created divisiveness and pain for members of Bethany community, both past and present.”

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Little Rock is banning police from using neck restraints following nationwide protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Mayor Frank Scott said Wednesday.
Scott signed an executive order banning use of the restraints or officers being trained on them, and also requiring officers to intervene to stop their use if they witness it. Scott’s order also requires the city to create and maintain a database on the restraints’ use and any corrective actions taken against officers for using them.
Little Rock Police Chief Keith Humphrey said the department had already banned chokeholds but had allowed a technique known as a “vascular neck restraint.”
The order doesn’t prohibit an officer from using “any reasonable force” if because of actual physical contact they face immediate threat of death or serious injury to themselves or anyone in their immediate vicinity.

HUNTINGTON, W.Va. — A city council in West Virginia has unanimously approved a proposal to make Juneteenth a permanent city holiday. The celebration, which commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S., is held annually on June 19.
Huntington Mayor Steve Williams told council members before Wednesday’s vote that it was important for city leaders to make such a statement.
“It doesn’t change the matter of life and livelihood for our African-American, black neighbors in our community,” Williams said. “But it does send a message. It sends a message that we’re standing shoulder to shoulder, arm in arm, heart to heart, that we have every expectation — not intention — expectation that we’re going to stand by them and make sure that the injustices that are present in our society are overcome.”
The city of about 45,000 residents along the Ohio River has a black population of about 9%.
Williams said the idea came from meetings with his diversity advisory committee amid the international protests following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a Minneapolis officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck as he pleaded for air.
City workers will get the paid holiday off.

BATON ROUGE, La. — A Louisiana lawmaker’s effort to eliminate police officers’ wide immunity from civil lawsuits for damages for injury or death was shelved by Republicans on a state House committee.
The House civil law committee voted 9-7 Wednesday against the measure from Democratic Rep. Edmond Jordan.
More than a dozen black lawmakers stood together in the room to support Jordan’s bill. After the vote, some left in tears.
Supporters of the bill said the immunity is so sweeping that it’s nearly impossible to hold officers accountable for excessive force when prosecutors refuse to bring criminal charges.
Opponents said legal avenues exist to prosecute police for excessive force. The Louisiana Sheriffs’ Association said the measure would make it harder for officers to combat crime.
The vote fell largely along party lines. Two GOP lawmakers joined Democrats in backing the measure, which was proposed after the death last month of George Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody and other recent instances of police brutality.

PORTLAND, Ore. — City commissioners voted Wednesday to cut $16 million from the Portland Police Bureau’s budget in response to concerns about police brutality and racial injustice.
The cuts are part of a city budget approved by the commissioners in a 3-1 vote. The money saved by eliminating the gun reduction violence team, school resource officers and transit officers will be redirected to social service programs. The lone commissioner to vote no said the cuts to police weren’t deep enough.
Thousands of protesters have filled the streets of Portland every night for three weeks following the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis on Memorial Day.

ATLANTA — The police officer who fatally shot Rayshard Brooks in the back after the fleeing man pointed a stun gun in his direction is going to be charged with felony murder and 10 other crimes.
Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard made the announcement about Garrett Rolfe during a news conference Wednesday.
Howard said Rolfe kicked Brooks while he lay on the ground and that the officer with him, Devin Brosnan, stood on Brooks’ shoulder as he struggled for life Friday night.
Rolfe had already been fired after he fatally shot the 27-year-old Brooks. Brosnan had been put on administrative leave.
Brosnan is being charged with aggravated assault and other crimes. The shooting had sparked new demonstrations in Georgia’s capital against police brutality.

 BOSTON — Police officers in Massachusetts would have to be certified by the state under a bill filed Wednesday by Gov. Charlie Baker.
The bill would also allow for the decertification of officers who engage in excessive force, and it encourages additional training, including for advanced deescalation techniques.
Massachusetts is one of only a few states without a statewide certification program for law enforcement.
The Republican governor said his administration worked with members of the Massachusetts Black and Latino Legislative Caucus and public safety officials to draft the bill.
Baker said at a press conference that the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis at the hands of police officers made it clear it's ""the time to get this done.” He added that improving law enforcement is only one piece of the process.

LONDON — The governing body of Oxford University’s Oriel College has recommended the removal of a statue of Victorian imperialist Cecil Rhodes that has long been the target of protests.
The college’s governors, made up of faculty, met Wednesday and said they had “voted to launch an independent Commission of Inquiry into the key issues surrounding the Rhodes statue.“
A similar campaign has sought the removal of his statue in Oxford. The movement has gained new momentum since the death of George Floyd spurred anti-racism protests around the world.
Rhodes made a fortune from gold and diamond mines in the late 19th century, with miners laboring in brutal conditions. His statue was removed from the University of Cape Town in South Africa in 2015.

RICHMOND, Va. — A statue of African American tennis star Arthur Ashe has been vandalized.
Photos show the base of the monument tagged with white spray paint and the words “white lives matter” as well as the initials “WLM.” Those initials were later painted over with “BLM,” short for black lives matter.
Richmond Police said they were alerted to the vandalism on Monument Avenue about 10:15 a.m. Wednesday. Police say red paint on the statue itself was already being removed by community members.
Authorities have information on possible suspects and are asking the community to call the Crime Stoppers line if they have information on who was responsible for the vandalism.
The monument was dedicated in 1996 to memorialize the Richmond native, who died in 1993, and to counterbalance the string of statues on Memorial Avenue dedicated to Confederate leaders.

LAS VEGAS — The University of Nevada, Las Vegas has removed a statue of its “Hey Reb!” mascot from in front of its alumni center following an outcry from student groups, including the Native American Student Association.
The decision to remove the bronze statue, which was criticized for its relationship to the Confederacy, came weeks after the death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis.
University President Marta Meana says she has had conversations with individuals and stakeholders about how the university can move forward in light of recent events.
The statue is expected to be returned to its donors.

NEW YORK — New York’s governor signed an executive order recognizing Juneteenth as a paid holiday for state employees to commemorate the emancipation of slaves in the U.S.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo called it “a day we should all reflect upon” and “a day that is especially relevant in this moment in history."" Cuomo said he’ll propose legislation next year making June 19 a permanent state holiday.
President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation was effective Jan. 1, 1863, but the news took time to travel. It wasn’t until June 19, 1865, when word of the proclamation was brought by the Union army to enslaved people in Texas.

AMSTERDAM — Vandals have daubed red paint and the word “racist” on a statue of Mohandas Gandhi in Amsterdam, amid a wave of attacks on statues around the world of controversial historical figures.
A worker cleaned the statue Wednesday with a high-pressure water hose. Gandhi, widely lauded for his peaceful campaign to win independence for India, has faced criticism for some of his writings about black Africans.
A lawyer, Gandhi traveled to South Africa in 1893 and stayed for two decades, fighting to expand rights for Indians there. He has faced criticism for referring in his writings to black South Africans as backward. However, he later changed his views and supported the rights of black South Africans.
His nonviolent resistance methods have been used in movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.

DETROIT — A white suburban Detroit police chief has been suspended for 30 days without pay and will undergo diversity training for inappropriate social media posts about people protesting the death of George Floyd.
Trustees in Macomb County’s Shelby Township voted 5-2 on Tuesday night on the punishment for chief Robert J. Shelide, who has held the title since 2015.
Shelide, who earlier apologized, told the township board before the vote that he is “not a racist” and “I bleed blue.”
Shelide had been on administrative leave the past two weeks while officials investigated posts on a now-deleted Twitter account. Screenshots posted on Facebook show one tweet spoke about the need to “unleash real cops” and describing protesters as “barbarians” and needing “body bags.“

PORTLAND, Ore. — Police say a man drove his car into a crowd of protesters early Wednesday in downtown Portland, injuring three people.
Police say the 27-year-old male driver drove away “at a high rate of speed,” but was tracked and arrested on suspicion of hit and run, reckless driving and possession of a controlled substance, according to The Oregonian/OregonLive.
Two people were taken by ambulance to a hospital. Another was taken for treatment in a personal car. Police say none of the injuries were life-threatening.

ATLANTA — Georgia’s lieutenant governor is proposing a version of a hate crimes law for the state.
Republican Geoff Duncan called on lawmakers to create a free-standing hate crime and include more categories of bias crimes. Those would involve people victimized because of their culture and their status in exercising First Amendment rights, including worship, free speech, free press, assembly or petition of government.
A previous effort was found unconstitutional by the state Supreme Court more than a decade ago.
In February, Ahmaud Arbery was shot near Brunswick, Georgia. Investigators have said a white man uttered a racial slur after chasing Arbery down and shooting him.
Georgia’s House passed a simpler measure last year that’s been stalled in a Senate committee for more than year. The bill would add extra penalties onto crimes committed because of someone’s race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, mental disability or physical disability.

GENEVA — The brother of George Floyd has made a heartfelt plea to the U.N.’s top human rights body to launch intense international scrutiny of systemic racism and the killing of unarmed blacks by police.
Philonese Floyd’s message by video to the Human Rights Council came as it contemplates an unprecedented bid sought by the Africa Group to create a Commission of Inquiry — the council’s most powerful tool of scrutiny — to examine and report on racism and violence against protesters by police in the United States.
“I am my brother’s keeper. You in the United Nations are your brothers and sisters’ keepers in America — and you have the power to help us get justice for my brother George Floyd,” Floyd said. “I am asking you to help him. I am asking you to help me. I am asking you to help us: Black people in America.”

A lawyer, Gandhi traveled to South Africa in 1893 and stayed for two decades, fighting to expand rights for Indians there. He has faced criticism for referring in his writings to black South Africans as backward. However, he later changed his views and supported the rights of black South Africans.
His nonviolent resistance methods have been used in movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.

DETROIT — A white suburban Detroit police chief has been suspended for 30 days without pay and will undergo diversity training for inappropriate social media posts about people protesting the death of George Floyd.
Trustees in Macomb County’s Shelby Township voted 5-2 on Tuesday night on the punishment for chief Robert J. Shelide, who has held the title since 2015.
Shelide, who earlier apologized, told the township board before the vote that he is “not a racist” and “I bleed blue.”
Shelide had been on administrative leave the past two weeks while officials investigated posts on a now-deleted Twitter account. Screenshots posted on Facebook show one tweet spoke about the need to “unleash real cops” and describing protesters as “barbarians” and needing “body bags.“

Police say the 27-year-old male driver drove away “at a high rate of speed,” but was tracked and arrested on suspicion of hit and run, reckless driving and possession of a controlled substance, according to The Oregonian/OregonLive.

ATLANTA — Georgia’s lieutenant governor is proposing a version of a hate crimes law for the state.
Republican Geoff Duncan called on lawmakers to create a free-standing hate crime and include more categories of bias crimes. Those would involve people victimized because of their culture and their status in exercising First Amendment rights, including worship, free speech, free press, assembly or petition of government.
A previous effort was found unconstitutional by the state Supreme Court more than a decade ago.
In February, Ahmaud Arbery was shot near Brunswick, Georgia. Investigators have said a white man uttered a racial slur after chasing Arbery down and shooting him.
Georgia’s House passed a simpler measure last year that’s been stalled in a Senate committee for more than year. The bill would add extra penalties onto crimes committed because of someone’s race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, mental disability or physical disability.

GENEVA — The brother of George Floyd has made a heartfelt plea to the U.N.’s top human rights body to launch intense international scrutiny of systemic racism and the killing of unarmed blacks by police.
Philonese Floyd’s message by video to the Human Rights Council came as it contemplates an unprecedented bid sought by the Africa Group to create a Commission of Inquiry — the council’s most powerful tool of scrutiny — to examine and report on racism and violence against protesters by police in the United States.
“I am my brother’s keeper. You in the United Nations are your brothers and sisters’ keepers in America — and you have the power to help us get justice for my brother George Floyd,” Floyd said. “I am asking you to help him. I am asking you to help me. I am asking you to help us: Black people in America.”

HUNTINGTON, W.Va. — The Huntington City Council in West Virginia will vote Wednesday on a proposal to make Juneteenth a permanent city holiday.
The celebration commemorates when enslaved people in Texas learned they were free on June 19, 1865. Huntington Mayor Steve Williams told The Herald-Dispatch he supports the proposal and wants the city’s African American residents to know “the city celebrates Juneteenth with them just as we all celebrate July Fourth together.”
The mayor says the idea for the holiday proposal came from meetings with his diversity advisory committee amid the international protests following the death of George Floyd. Williams expects Wednesday’s meeting will help fast-track the resolution so council members can get it in the books before Friday.
The Emancipation Proclamation was signed by President Abraham Lincoln on Jan. 1, 1863, and freed enslaved people of the rebellion Confederate states.

HOUSTON — Officials say a statue of a Confederate soldier has been removed from a downtown Houston park and a second Confederate statue is expected to be removed soon.
The “Spirit of the Confederacy” statue was removed late Tuesday from Sam Houston Park. Mayor Sylvester Turner said last week the statue will be housed in the Houston Museum of African American Culture.
A second statue, of Confederate artillery commander Richard W. “Dick” Dowling, is also slated for removal. Initially, the Dowling statue was to be moved from Houston’s Hermann Park to the Sabine Pass Battleground State Historical Site near Port Arthur.
But officials say the Dowling statue will instead be placed in a warehouse, at least temporarily, after leaders in Port Arthur expressed opposition.

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Little Rock is banning police from using neck restraints following nationwide protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Mayor Frank Scott said Wednesday.
Scott signed an executive order banning use of the restraints or officers being trained on them, and also requiring officers to intervene to stop their use if they witness it. Scott’s order also requires the city to create and maintain a database on the restraints’ use and any corrective actions taken against officers for using them.
Little Rock Police Chief Keith Humphrey said the department had already banned chokeholds but had allowed a technique known as a “vascular neck restraint.”
The order doesn’t prohibit an officer from using “any reasonable force” if because of actual physical contact they face immediate threat of death or serious injury to themselves or anyone in their immediate vicinity.

BATON ROUGE, La. — A Louisiana lawmaker’s effort to eliminate police officers’ wide immunity from civil lawsuits for damages for injury or death was shelved by Republicans on a state House committee.
The House civil law committee voted 9-7 Wednesday against the measure from Democratic Rep. Edmond Jordan.
More than a dozen black lawmakers stood together in the room to support Jordan’s bill. After the vote, some left in tears.
Supporters of the bill said the immunity is so sweeping that it’s nearly impossible to hold officers accountable for excessive force when prosecutors refuse to bring criminal charges.
Opponents said legal avenues exist to prosecute police for excessive force. The Louisiana Sheriffs’ Association said the measure would make it harder for officers to combat crime.
The vote fell largely along party lines. Two GOP lawmakers joined Democrats in backing the measure, which was proposed after the death last month of George Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody and other recent instances of police brutality.
___
PORTLAND, Ore. — City commissioners voted Wednesday to cut $16 million from the Portland Police Bureau’s budget in response to concerns about police brutality and racial injustice.
The cuts are part of a city budget approved by the commissioners in a 3-1 vote. The money saved by eliminating the gun reduction violence team, school resource officers and transit officers will be redirected to social service programs. The lone commissioner to vote no said the cuts to police weren’t deep enough.
Thousands of protesters have filled the streets of Portland every night for three weeks following the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis on Memorial Day.

ATLANTA — The police officer who fatally shot Rayshard Brooks in the back after the fleeing man pointed a stun gun in his direction is going to be charged with felony murder and 10 other crimes.
Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard made the announcement about Garrett Rolfe during a news conference Wednesday.
Howard said Rolfe kicked Brooks while he lay on the ground and that the officer with him, Devin Brosnan, stood on Brooks’ shoulder as he struggled for life Friday night.
Rolfe had already been fired after he fatally shot the 27-year-old Brooks. Brosnan had been put on administrative leave.
Brosnan is being charged with aggravated assault and other crimes. The shooting had sparked new demonstrations in Georgia’s capital against police brutality.

 BOSTON — Police officers in Massachusetts would have to be certified by the state under a bill filed Wednesday by Gov. Charlie Baker.
The bill would also allow for the decertification of officers who engage in excessive force, and it encourages additional training, including for advanced deescalation techniques.
Massachusetts is one of only a few states without a statewide certification program for law enforcement.
The Republican governor said his administration worked with members of the Massachusetts Black and Latino Legislative Caucus and public safety officials to draft the bill.
Baker said at a press conference that the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis at the hands of police officers made it clear it's ""the time to get this done.” He added that improving law enforcement is only one piece of the process.

LONDON — The governing body of Oxford University’s Oriel College has recommended the removal of a statue of Victorian imperialist Cecil Rhodes that has long been the target of protests.
The college’s governors, made up of faculty, met Wednesday and said they had “voted to launch an independent Commission of Inquiry into the key issues surrounding the Rhodes statue.“
A similar campaign has sought the removal of his statue in Oxford. The movement has gained new momentum since the death of George Floyd spurred anti-racism protests around the world.
Rhodes made a fortune from gold and diamond mines in the late 19th century, with miners laboring in brutal conditions. His statue was removed from the University of Cape Town in South Africa in 2015.

RICHMOND, Va. — A statue of African American tennis star Arthur Ashe has been vandalized.
Photos show the base of the monument tagged with white spray paint and the words “white lives matter” as well as the initials “WLM.” Those initials were later painted over with “BLM,” short for black lives matter.
Richmond Police said they were alerted to the vandalism on Monument Avenue about 10:15 a.m. Wednesday. Police say red paint on the statue itself was already being removed by community members.
Authorities have information on possible suspects and are asking the community to call the Crime Stoppers line if they have information on who was responsible for the vandalism.
The monument was dedicated in 1996 to memorialize the Richmond native, who died in 1993, and to counterbalance the string of statues on Memorial Avenue dedicated to Confederate leaders.

LAS VEGAS — The University of Nevada, Las Vegas has removed a statue of its “Hey Reb!” mascot from in front of its alumni center following an outcry from student groups, including the Native American Student Association.
The decision to remove the bronze statue, which was criticized for its relationship to the Confederacy, came weeks after the death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis.
University President Marta Meana says she has had conversations with individuals and stakeholders about how the university can move forward in light of recent events.
The statue is expected to be returned to its donors.

Oppel Jr.",NA,"Kenosha Officer Is Member of Department's Bike Squad",FALSE,"A seven-year veteran, Rusten Sheskey has said he sees the value of doing ''public relations'' on the job.
Rusten Sheskey, the police officer who authorities say shot Jacob Blake in the back on Sunday, is a seven-year veteran of the Kenosha Police Department who long aspired to a law enforcement career and once described police work as ''a customer service job, and the public is our customer.'' 
 Officer Sheskey, 31, has been put on administrative leave while Wisconsin officials investigate the confrontation caught on video in which he is seen shooting while Mr. Blake leans into the driver's side of his car. Mr. Blake remains in stable condition in a hospital, though his family's lawyers say he is paralyzed.
 State authorities said Officer Sheskey fired his weapon seven times while holding on to Mr. Blake's shirt during an arrest. They also said that investigators found a knife on the driver's-side floorboard after the shooting. But a lawyer for Mr. Blake's family, Benjamin Crump, has said that Mr. Blake did not have a knife in his hand, and that he was trying to get into his car to protect his three sons, who were in the back seat.
 The Kenosha police have not released Officer Sheskey's employment file. The only disciplinary infraction that has surfaced during his time with the department was a one-day suspension without pay in 2017 for an unspecified violation of policy related to the safe use of department vehicles.
 He was also sued in 2015, along with the city of Kenosha, in a personal injury case that involved a vehicle. The court docket indicates that the case was resolved a year later. He also pleaded no contest in 2014 for a traffic infraction involving his failure to obey an officer or traffic signal.
 According to county records, he started his job in April 2013 after working as an officer at the University of Wisconsin-Parkside campus, which is outside Kenosha. While at the university, he responded to reports of hate crimes at the school, including one involving the discovery of nooses and a flier threatening Black students.
 Officer Sheskey's grandfather was a longtime officer for the Kenosha police, according to a department Facebook post.
 Officer Sheskey was a competitive bicycle racer in high school, taking part in races as far away as Muscatine, Iowa. He has been a member of the Kenosha department's bike squad for several years, an assignment that freed officers from the constraints of a patrol car and allowed them to interact more with the public, he told The Kenosha News last year.
 ''If you want to do more enforcement, you can do that,'' he said. ''If you want to do more public relations -- go down to the lake, stop out and talk with the people -- you can choose to do that as well.''
 Officer Sheskey told the newspaper that ''for the most part'' he had always wanted to be in law enforcement.
 ''What I like most is that you're dealing with people on perhaps the worst day of their lives and you can try and help them as much as you can and make that day a little bit better,'' Officer Sheskey said.
 He added: ''We may not be able to make a situation right, or better, but we can maybe make it a little easier for them to handle during that time.''

Considerdonating[1]today to support our mission. J oe Biden will become the first Syracuse University alumnus to serve as president of the United States. The former vice president defeated President Donald Trump after obtaining at least 273electoral votes with victories in battlegroundstates, including Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. 
Biden graduated from SU's College of Law in 1968 and has maintained connections[2] with the university throughout his political career. His running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-California) will be the first woman and the first person of color to serve as vice president. Biden's victory came four daysafter Election Day, as the country waited for several keystates to count a massivevolume of mail-in ballots. Almost 60 million voters opted to vote by mail in this election after states expanded mail-in and early voting options due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Associated Press, CNN and NBC News have projected Biden as the winner of the 2020 election after he secured a lead in Pennsylvania, winning the state's 20 electoral votes. Arizona, Nevada and Georgia remain too close to call, but Biden currently holds a lead in those states. The former vice president won despite the Trump campaignfiling longshot lawsuits in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia to dispute, without any evidence, the legitimacy of the ballot-counting process. Since Election Day, Trump and his campaign pushed a false narrative claiming that Democrats were 'stealing' the election — haphazardly calling forvote counts to continuein some states and to stop in others. Biden served as a Delaware senator for 36 years before he was elected in 2008 to serve as the 44th vice president alongside former President Barack Obama. He served another term as vice president to Obama in 2012.Throughout the race, Biden has based his campaign around a promise to 'build back better,' which includes restoring the economy following the coronavirus pandemic and healing political division in the country. His victory comes as COVID-19 has killed over 235,000 Americans and after protestersacross the country swept the streets this summer in the wake of thekilling of George Floyd in May. Trump has faced criticism over his response to the coronavirus, but Biden plans to expand rapid COVID-19 testing across the country and implement a national mask mandate. Biden also pledged toprovide 'clear guidance' for how schools and businesses should operate during the pandemic and a plan for an equitable distribution of vaccines. While Biden has firmly rejected calls to defund police departments, he plans to spend an additional $300 million a year on community policing initiatives and other reforms. He would also seek to decriminalize recreational marijuana but would not attempt nationwide legalization. Republicans are likely to hold on to the Senate and Democrats to the House.Biden will inherit a divided Congress, further challenging his ability to transform campaign promises into legislative actionas the country fails to overcomethe pandemic. Joe Biden visited SU in 2015 as part of his speaking tour for 'It's On Us,' a campaign to prevent sexual assault on college campuses. Daily Orange File PhotoFollowing his graduation from SU, the president-elect made several visits to the university and delivered three commencement addresses. He was the commencement speaker for the College of Law in 2006 and the keynote speaker during SU's 2009 commencement ceremony. During his second address, which came a little over a year into his term as vice president, he reflected on his experiences at SU and how they contributed to his political career. 'Since I've been in public life, there has never been a graduating class that is graduating into a moment where they actually have a chance to make more than incremental change,' Biden said in the speech. 'That's why Barack and I ran. That's why I believe so passionately we have a shot like hasn't occurred in the lifetime of anyone in this Dome. And now we're here. Imagine what we can do.' Biden visited campus again in 2015, towardthe end of his second term as vice president. During the visit, Biden spoke about preventing sexual assault and domestic violence on college campuses as part of the 'It's On Us' campaign. Biden and Obama created the campaign in 2014. The president-elect made his most recent visit to SU in 2016, when he delivered another commencement address[3] to the College of Law. During this speech, he spoke about his son Beau Biden, who died of brain cancer in May 2015. Beau Biden graduated from SU's College of Law in 1994 and delivered the college's commencement address in 2011. In November 2019, Biden said he was 'deeply disturbed'[4] by a series of racist incidents that occurred on and near campus last fall. Biden's first presidentialcampaigncollapsedin 1987 after he admitted to plagiarism, including a law review article for an essay in his first year of law school at SU.The president-elect told The New York Times in 1987 that while he made a mistake by plagiarizing, he had just misunderstood the assignment's citing requirements. Shortly after the scandal, Biden dropped out of the presidential race. Joe Biden spoke at the 2016 commencement for SU's College of Law, where both he and his late son Beau Biden earned law degrees. Daily Orange File PhotoBiden also dated and married his first wife, Neilia Hunter, during his time at SU. They lived together about three miles from SU's campus before moving to Delaware after Biden graduated. Neilia died in a car crash in 1972 that also killed the couple's infant daughter, Naomi Biden, and severely injured his two sons, Hunter and Beau Biden. During his first commencement speech at SU, Biden discussed how his life experiences taught him how to handle adversity. His victory represents a shift from Trump on many key issues, including climate change, immigration and health care. The president-elect plans to support an active federal role in reducing greenhouse gases and has introduced a $2 trillion plan to fight climate change by eliminating carbon emissions from the electric sector by 2035. Trump, however, has dismissed the science behind climate change and withdrew the country from the Paris agreement among the United Nations, which aims to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees. Biden has said he will rejoin the agreement and urge other nations to increase their commitments to the climate. Trump and Biden also significantly diverge on immigration. While Trump had built nearly 321 miles of barriers on the U.S.-Mexico border as of September, Biden has said he would immediately stop the construction of the border wall and focus his immigration policy on improving screening systems across the border. The former vice president has also said he would work to raise the limit of refugees allowed in the country. Trump limited the number to 15,000 in October, the lowest it has ever been. Biden supports the Affordable Care Act, a comprehensive health care reform law passed while Biden was serving as vice president under Obama. Trump has opposed the ACA but has yet to produce an alternative plan. The president-elect has also endorsed Dana Balter, the Democratic candidate for New York's 24th Congressional District and a former professor in SU's Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs. Balter's platform focused on progressive policies such as strengthening the Affordable Care Act and raising the minimum wage. The race between Katko and Balter remains undecided, as Balter refuses to concede until the district's nearly 70,000 absentee ballots are counted next week. https://donate.dailyorange.com/ The post JOE BIDEN WINS: 1st Syracuse University alumnus to be elected president[5] appeared first on The Daily Orange[6].

The Chamber of Deputies discussed this years state budget deficit for more than four hours. So far, the deficit in 2020 will be the highest in Czech history.[113] 'I'm Not Apologizing' — Goya Foods CEO Reacts to 'Cancel Culture' Attacks Over Trump Support[114] Authored by Jennie Taer via SaraACarter.com Because the CEO and President of Goya Foods, Bob Unanue, praised President Donald Trump, many liberals are boycotting his company. By Thursday evening, 'Goya,' #BoycottGoya and #Goyaway were trending topics on Twitter.[115] 'Liberal' NYC Cafe Owner Terrorized by Yuppie Neighbors After Claiming He Voted for Trump[116] After helping to legitimize cancel culture by running countless thinkpieces on the subject while its reporters increasingly adopted a strategy of covering these cancel campaigns and publishing opinion pieces written by (mostly minority) authors arguing extremist positions based on what should be a frightening underlying assumption: That every individual who expresses support for the president, or who in any other way breaks with the liberal orthodoxies espoused by the Times and its staff, is worthy of scorn and shame. Even when people like Chris Cooper, clearly a compassionate individual, say that the now-infamous 'Central Park Karen' Amy Cooper has 'suffered enough' when he decided not to cooperate with an NYPD investigation into his erstwhile tormentor's transgressions.[117] 'Political Prosecution!': Trump Rages After Supreme Court Tax Ruling[118] Update (1042ET): Deutsche Bank says it will comply with the Supreme Court's decision and will provide Trump's records to NY prosecutors, according to Bloomberg. An angry Trump, meanwhile, tweeted that the Supreme Court decision is 'all a political prosecution,' and that 'Courts in the past have given 'broad deference.' BUT NOT ME!'[119] 'Squad' Members Tlaib, Pressley Reveal Far-Left Breathe Act; Would Defund Police, Pay Reparations for 'Criminalizing Prostitution'[120] In a virtual meeting Tuesday, Democratic Representatives Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley announced their proposal they've dubbed the BREATHE Act, part of the agenda designed by the Movement for Black Lives.[121] 80-Year-Old Badly Beaten Inside Grocery Store Bathroom, Suspect at Large[122] An 80-year-old man was savagely beaten and robbed inside a grocery store restroom in Lancaster, California on Thursday, after which authorities circulated a photo of the suspect, who is still at large. The suspect is a black man believed to be between 20 and 25 years old, about 5 feet 8 inches tall, and approximately 250 pounds, according to the sheriff's department. He was wearing a mask featuring large teeth and fangs at the time of the attack. Authorities also released a photo of a possible female accomplice, who accompanied the man to the store.[123] Amazon Claims Email Asking Workers to Delete TikTok Was Sent 'In Error'[124] Update (1700ET): What the hell is going on out there in Seattle? Hours after the NYT reported on the contents of an internal Amazon email that was apparently sent company wide (at least to enough people that a copy quickly leaked to the press), Amazon is claiming that it sent the email 'in error', and will not be pushing its employees to download the app from personal phones. AMAZON SAYS IT SENT DELETE TIKTOK EMAIL IN ERROR AMAZON SAYS THERE'S NO CHANGE IN ITS POLICY TOWARD TIKTOK APP Did Amazon's corporate comms team inhale too much tear gas during that whole CHOP episode?[125] Amazon to Remove Washington Redskins Merchandise From Online Store[126] In a notification to sellers on Wednesday, Amazon announced it would be removing a variety of Washington Redskins merchandise, including t-shirts, jerseys, and jewelry. In a notification to sellers on Wednesday, Amazon announced it would be removing a variety of Washington Redskins merchandise, including t-shirts, jerseys, and jewelry.[127] AOC Doesn't Think Cancel Culture is a Thing[128] In the old days, people used to debate ideas and disagree with you if they thought you were wrong about something. These days, they increasingly call your employers, sponsor, or platform provider, and complain to have you fired or shut down. We've covered several cases of people losing their job over their opinions, or even for merely adding a hashtag in support of the world's most famous living author. And these are only the stories of those big enough to get attention. If you want to see cancel culture, go on Twitter and search for the phrase: 'find out where he works' or similar phrases and you'll find plenty of examples.[129] Army Graduates Its 1st Woman Green Beret[130] The first female soldier in history has graduated from the Special Forces Qualification Course and become an official member of the Army's Green Beret unit. This history-making woman soldier received her Special Forces shoulder tab alongside several other male classmates at North Carolina's Fort Bragg. Green Beret soldiers remain unidentified due to the sensitive nature of the assignments and missions they receive following graduation.[131] As NFL Star Quotes Fake Hitler, SPLC and ADL Accuse Jack Posobiec of Anti-Semitism[132] On Wednesday, the far-left smear factory Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) took aim at OANN correspondent Jack Posobiec, claiming his rise was 'tied to [the] white supremacist movement,' and accusing Posobiec of anti-Semitism. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the Simon Weisenthal Center, and Bend the Arc: Jewish Action bolstered the SPLC's anti-Semitism accusations. Yet some Jewish leaders defended Posobiec, condemning the SPLC and ADL for targeting the OANN correspondent when major black celebrities have praised notorious anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan. Indeed, the SPLC released this investigation just after Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver DeSean Jackson shared a fake quote from Adolf Hitler warning that 'white Jews' planned for 'world domination.' After Jackson apologized, former NBA player Stephen Jackson defended DeSean Jackson's posts, saying he had been 'speaking truth.' Both DeSean Jackson and Stephen Jackson praise Farrakhan. Dov Hikind, a Jewish radio talk show host and former Democratic member of the New York State Assembly, slammed the SPLC and ADL for focusing on Posobiec rather than Farrakhan.[133] Atlanta Mayor Set to Reimpose Lockdown as Cases Surge, Defying Gov Kemp, Trump: Live Updates[134] Update (1750ET): In what would be potentially precedent-setting action for Democratic mayors of cities in the hardest hit parts of the Sun Belt (and beyond), Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms is reportedly preparing to roll back the city's reopening plans all the way to Phase 1, which would require residents to remain at home except for essential trips.[135] CNN's Don Lemon: 'Jesus Christ Admittedly Was Not Perfect When He Was Here on This Earth'[136] CNN host Don Lemon claimed Wednesday that Jesus Christ admitted to not being perfect while he was on the earth in human form.[137] Colorado City to Require Face Masks, Threatens Up to 1 Year in Jail for Violators[138] A Colorado city located just south of Denver is requiring all citizens to wear coronavirus face masks, threatening up to nearly one year in prison for those who violate the new mandate. An emergency order issued by Englewood City Manager J. Shawn Lewis and approved by the city council Monday says that every resident over the age of six must wear a face covering when outside their homes.[139] Confirmed: Black Man Found Hanging From a Tree in California Ruled Suicide Not Lynching[140] In June 24-year-old Robert Fuller was found hanging from a tree in Palmdale, California. Local activists immediately insisted Fuller was a lynching victim. They held protests against racism in his honor. Several protesters gathered outside the Palmdale Sheriff's Department demanding answers on Fuller's death. On Thursday California investigators ruled Robert Fuller's death a suicide. It was not a lynching.[141] Constitutional Republic vs. Pure Democracy: How the U.S. Election Process Has Changed[142] Conservatives are generally quick to point out that America is a republic, not a democracy. But what really is the difference, and are they even right? Voting in America has changed considerably since the days of our founding. Back then, the government didn't even print official ballots. Instead, you got ballots from the candidate who wanted your support. Sometimes voting took place in public, so everyone knew who you voted for. And, of course, the franchise was largely restricted to white, male property owners. Now, anyone who turns 18 can vote. And the Democratic Party wants to increase ballot access by automatically registering anyone who gets a driver's license. Democrats even pushed for mail-in ballots for the 2020 election to make voting even easier — and more open to voter fraud. But is any of this a good thing? Indeed, it is worth considering the transformation of the United States from a Constitutional Republic, ruled by law with the input of the people, to a total democracy, where the will of the people dominates all other discussion.[143] De Blasio Says BLM Protests Can Continue While Canceling All Other Large Events[144] New York City's Mayor Bill de Blasio made some stunning remarks on CNN, declaring protests in the streets were perfectly acceptable while canceling other large events through September. De Blasio joined CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday evening, discussing the evolving pandemic and policy response by City Hall to mitigate the spread in the city. He said social justice warriors were too important after months of protests have yet produced an outbreak in cases. 'This is a historic moment of change. We have to respect that but also say to people the kinds of gatherings we're used to, the parades, the fairs — we just can't have that while we're focusing on health right now,' de Blasio told Blitzer.[145] Dead Cat Receives Voter Registration Form by Mail[146] A long-dead cat in Georgia received a voter registration form by mail on Wednesday, much to the confusion of its former owner. Carol Tims — the owner of Cody, who died roughly 12 years ago — said she was confused on how her cat had received a form to register to vote. The form was addressed to 'Cody Tims' with a pre-printed label.[147] FBI Man at the Heart of Surveillance Abuses is a Professor of Spying Ethics[148] Submitted by Paul Sperry of RealClearInvestigations The unnamed FBI 'Supervisory Intelligence Analyst' cited by the Justice Department's watchdog for failing to properly vet the so-called Steele dossier before it was used to justify spying on the Trump campaign teaches a class on the ethics of spying at a small Washington-area college, records show. The senior FBI analyst, Brian J. Auten, has taught the course at Patrick Henry College since 2010, including the 11-month period in 2016 and 2017 when he and a counterintelligence team at FBI headquarters electronically monitored an adviser to the Trump campaign based on false rumors from the dossier and forged evidence.[149] Florida Man Friday: Forget the Gators, It's Zombie Attack Time[150] What a weird week it's been for Florida Man, and yes I know that's like me saying I had a lot to drink last night. (I did, BTW.) Was it the long Independence Day weekend? Has mandatory mask-wearing caused people to inhale too many of their own fumes? Has the Wuhan virus mutated so that it affects the brain, turning people into actual zombies? Whatever the reason, I've got a Sunshine State-sized Igloo cooler full of refreshing weirdness for you on another thrilling installment of Florida Man Friday![151] Flynn Judge Defies Appeals Court, Asks for Full Review of Order to Drop Case[152] The judge in Michael Flynn's criminal case is refusing to accept the results of a federal appeals court three-judge decision ordering him to dismiss the case against the former national security adviser. Judge Emmet Sullivan has instead asked the appeals court for an 'en banc' review of the decision — meaning the entire panel of all active judges on the court would re-hear the case.[153] Fondling in Plain Sight: Austin Police Under Fire Over Viral Video of 'Routine' Traffic Stop[154] A routine traffic stop has resulted in widespread outrage after an Austin, Texas police officer performed a search of a young woman while a crowd of onlookers filmed the incident. Video which appeared online Tuesday resulted in a storm of controversy. While police say the officer acted 'appropriately,' the woman has accused the officer of sexual assault, given that while he patted her down looking for drugs or weapons he appeared to grope her breasts.[155] Ford Employees Ask Company to Stop Building Police Vehicles[156] A cadre of Ford employees have banded together to ask the automaker to stop building and selling police vehicles for the first time in 70 years. According to automotive website Jalopnik, approximately 100 employees support a letter to CEO Jim Hackett and Chairman Bill Ford asking for the change.[157] Former Prison Official Says Ghislaine Maxwell Should be Transferred to Rikers for Her Own Safety[158] Former NYC Department of Corrections Deputy Warden Ed Gavin says that Ghislaine Maxwell should be moved to Rikers Island for her own safety. Appearing on Fox News with Tucker Carlson, Gavin said that the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn, where Maxwell is currently being held, is not suited to handler her. Following her transfer from a New Hampshire prison to MDC, the alleged sex trafficker was called a 'depressed loner' and branded a 'snooty rich bitch' by her fellow inmates, leaving open the possibility that she might be violently attacked.[159] Ghislaine Maxwell Made to Wear Paper Clothes Due to 'Suicide Risk'[160] Alleged Epstein co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell is being made to wear paper clothes while being held in custody over fears she will try to commit suicide. Maxwell, who was arrested last week, has been given a cellmate at Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn but has had her bedding removed and is under constant surveillance.[161] Ghislaine Maxwell Hires Elite Legal Team to Face US Prosecutors[162] Accused sex-trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell has hired a fleet of powerhouse attorneys to defend her against federal charges that she procured underage girls as young as 14 for sexual encounters with deceased pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. According to Bloomberg Law, 'Maxwell will confront federal prosecutors with years of experience in New York courts and deep knowledge of the child sex-trafficking allegations surrounding her and her former lover Jeffrey Epstein.'[163] Gov. Eric Holcomb Refuses to Say 'No' To Renaming Indiana[164] Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb refused to say 'no' Wednesday when asked at a press conference if he supports calls to rename the state of Indiana. 'I haven't given that any thought,' Holcomb replied. 'Although I've talked with Native American friends of mine about our shared past and our heritage.'[165] Growing Number of Texas Sheriffs Are Refusing to Enforce Face Mask Requirement[166] Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott is facing a growing mutiny from local sheriffs unwilling to enforce his statewide mandatory mask requirement for citizens. At least nine Texas counties have gone on record saying they will not be willing to issue citations for those who violate the order, questioning whether the governor even has the constitutional authority to enact it.[167] Head of Emergency Management Says Texans Should Wear Masks Inside Their Own Homes[168] The head of the Texas Division of Emergency Management gave an interview in which he said that people should wear masks inside their own homes in order to stop the spread of coronavirus. Appearing on Fox News at Nine, Chief Nim Kidd insisted that people should wear masks indoors if they have potentially exposed themselves to the virus by being outside.[169] Ivy League Cancels All Fall Sports on Pandemic Fears Through 2020[170] Another coronavirus-related bombshell this week: after Harvard announced its Fall semester is going to online instruction only, with only 40% of students invited back to live on campus, the Ivy League on Wednesday announced the suspension of all Fall sports. It's the first Division I conference to make the drastic move nixing football and all other collegiate sports over fears of the coronavirus pandemic. It plans to hold no competitions until after January 1. 'We simply do not believe we can create and maintain an environment for intercollegiate athletic competition that meets our requirements for safety and acceptable levels of risk,' the Ivy League Council of Presidents explained in a statement.[171] NHL is Back in Business With Ratification of CBA, Return-to-Play Plan[172] The NHL is back in business. And a Stanley Cup tournament unlike any other is on the horizon. Call it all systems go on the league's summer restart following Friday's ratification of protocols governing the return-to-play plan and an extension to the collective bargaining agreement running through September 2026. That paves the way for training camps to open Monday in 24 cities — more than four months after the season was paused because of the COVID-19 pandemic.[173] NYC Mayor De Blasio Helps Paint 'Black Lives Matter' Outside Trump Tower[174] Following in the footsteps of Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, NYC Mayor de Blasio joined in the fun (and posed for a few photos that might help bolster his abysmal approval ratings) after closing down a swath of 5th Avenue to paint 'Black Lives Matter' in big yellow letters outside Trump Tower.[175] Oregon Man Driving Stolen Car Collides With Woman Driving Another Stolen Car[176] A police chase in Oregon came to an abrupt halt when a male driver fleeing local authorities in a stolen car crashed into a woman who was also driving a stolen vehicle. Newberg-Dundee police pursued Randy Lee Cooper, 27, in a stolen Toyota Land Cruiser for several blocks before he collided with a Buick Regal while he was attempting to elude law enforcement. Cooper was arrested and charged with unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, attempting to elude police, assault, and reckless driving. After taking Cooper into custody, the police discovered that the second vehicle had also been reported stolen three weeks prior. The driver, Kristin Nicole Begue, 25, was also arrested and charged with driving under the influence and unauthorized use of a motor vehicle.[177] Penn State Deletes Tweet Welcoming Conservative Students After Outcry[178] Authored by Jonathan Turley Earlier, we discussed the formal censuring of a conservative student at Georgetown for his criticism of Black Lives Matter as an organization and his objections to a recent ruling by the Supreme Court. Georgetown University has remained silent as the student has been declared a racist and the student government called for his investigation. At Penn State, the university took an important step in this time of rising intolerance and actually included conservative students in a welcoming message. It did not last. After an outcry from students, the university deleted the tweet — thereby sending precisely the opposite message to conservative students.[179] Police Arrest Man Who Sucker-Punched 12-Year-Old Boy Dancing on Sidewalk[180] Missouri police have arrested and charged the man caught on tape sucker-punching a 12-year-old boy who was street dancing last Friday evening. Cedric Charles Moore, 27, walked into the Scott County Sheriff's Office on Wednesday and 'turned himself in peacefully,' the Cape Girardeau Police Department posted on Facebook.[181] Reddit Bans Forum Dedicated to Exposing Hate Crime Hoaxes[182] The same day Reddit removed the site's largest pro-Trump forum, the liberal platform also banned a popular subreddit dedicated to exposing hate crime hoaxes, according to the Daily Caller. Apparently calling out people who stoke racial division by faking hate crimes is considered to be 'promoting hate' by Reddit's overlords.[183] Rep. Jim Jordan Wants Censorship Answers From Twitter[184] House Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio's fourth district wants Twitter to submit documents justifying the censorship of President Trump's tweets. The congressman accuses Twitter of bias. Jordan, who is also a member of the House Judiciary Committee, asked for the documents through a letter addressed to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey on July 8. In the letter, Jordan accuses Twitter of practicing 'editorial control.' The letter notes that censorship is exercised on conservatives and not liberals. For that reason, Jordan asserts that the platform is 'moderating user content in a viewpoint-neutral manner.'[185] Roger Stone: Trump Commutes Ex-Adviser's Sentence[186] US President Donald Trump has commuted the prison sentence of his former adviser Roger Stone. The announcement came just after the Washington DC Court of Appeals denied Stone's request to delay the start date of his custodial term of 40 months. He was convicted of lying to Congress, obstruction and witness tampering.[187] Students Increasingly Don't Value Free Speech, Support Administrators Monitoring Online Activity[188] In the era of social media networks, everyone gets to express their take on almost everything under the sun — within reason. Naturally, some opinions and remarks don't sit well with everyone, resulting in outrage and people feeling offended. While some believe that expressing their opinions without hesitation is upholding their free speech rights, others state that they are willing to sacrifice their free speech rights to prevent offending people. And it seems that college students no longer support free speech as much as they used to. In last year's survey from free speech group FIRE, almost all students asked, 96 percent, believe that their civil rights should be protected. But only 30 percent said that 'free speech' was the most important.[189] Supreme Court: Nearly Half of Oklahoma is Indian Reservation[190] While all eyes were on the Supreme Court's Thursday decision granting New York prosecutors access to President Trump's taxes, a ruling earlier in the day recognized roughly half of Oklahoma as an Indian reservation — in a move which could have wide-ranging legal implications for the 1.8 million people who now live in 'Indian Country,' according to the New York Times. The decision, authored by Justice Neil Gorsuch, holds the United States to an 1866 treaty that the Muscogee (Creek) Nation signed with the United States after the Civil War over land which was home to the 'Five Civilized Tribes'; the Creek, Cherokee Nation, the Seminole, the Chickasaw Nation, and the Choctaw Nation, according to The New Republic. 'Today we are asked whether the land these treaties promised remains an Indian reservation for purposes of federal criminal law,' wrote Gorsuch, a Trump appointee. 'Because Congress has not said otherwise, we hold the government to its word.'[191] Televangelists Jim Bakker, Peter Popoff, Jimmy Swaggart, Joyce Meyer Receive Millions in PPP Loans[192] Included in the roughly 10,000 religious organizations that have received federal COVID-19 relief from the federal government are some highly controversial televangelists and wealthy prosperity-gospel preachers.[193] The Proportion of White People in the US is Declining Faster Than Expected[194] The proportion of the white population in the United States is declining faster than expected. According to an analysis by the Brookings Institution think tank, based on data from the United States Census Bureau (USCB), the period between 2010 and 2020 will be the first decade in which the total number of whites in the United States declined. Therefore, they could become a minority in the USA sooner than expected, says Czech economist Lukas Kovanda. Between 2010 and 2019, the US population growth was driven exclusively by racial and ethnic minorities. In a lot of states, where the dying out of the white population would lead to an overall decline, minorities still ensured population growth. Back in the 1980s, whites accounted for almost 80 percent of the total population, Blacks for 11.5 percent, Hispanics 6.5 percent, and Asians around 1.8 percent.[195] Trump Finally Reveals His Role in Putting Down the 'CHOP' Antifa Occupation in Seattle[196] When Mayor Jenny Durkan (D-Seattle) finally sent police in to clear up the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP) — perhaps better referred to as 'Antifastan' (no offense to Central Asian countries) — she only acted because President Donald Trump was about to do so if she delayed. The president himself confirmed a rumor to that effect on Sean Hannity's show Thursday night. Trump said he forced Durkan's hand to restore law and order after antifa militants had seized territory in Seattle.[197] Trump Tells Treasury to Review Universities' Tax Exempt Status[198] Most private and public colleges and universities are exempt from taxes because they qualify as 501(c)(3) organizations. Trump did not say which specific institutions he would target. The IRS, which would conduct the potential review, is prohibited through federal law from targeting groups based on ideology. Trump also spoke about schools' ideologies during his Fourth of July remarks at Mount Rushmore.[199] Trump: 'Everyone's Leaving' New York, 'It's Turned Out to be a Hellhole'[200] Commenting on the Supreme Court's ruling on Thursday that said the Manhattan district attorney can obtain his personal financial records, President Trump disparaged New York City as a 'hellhole.' 'This is purely political. I win at the federal level and we won very decisively and so they send it to New York,' Trump said in reference to the city's pursuit of his shielded records. 'You know what's going on in New York. Everyone's leaving. It's turned out to be a hellhole, and they better do something about it because people are leaving New York. But this is a political witch hunt that just continues.'[201] University of Delaware Sued Over Biden's Hidden Senate Records[202] A lawsuit has been filed against the University of Delaware to try and force the college to hand over Joe Biden's Senate Records, which are housed at the university's library. Biden, who graduated from the University of Delaware and served as Delaware's senator, transferred the records to the university in 2011 — which announced a change to their expected unsealing shortly before Biden announced his bid for the White House. Meanwhile, Biden has refused to allow a search of the roughly 1,875 boxes of documents and 415 gigabytes of electronic records. Biden's excuse? That the records could expose unrelated things he's said or done which could be 'taken out of context' and used against him before the November election. The lawsuit, brought under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) by Judicial Watch on behalf of themselves and the Daily Caller News Foundation, was filed in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware. It follows a denial of April 30 requests for Biden's records, as well as records about the preservation — and proposed release, of documents.[203] Update: Driver Charged With Vehicular Homicide After Hitting Two BLM White Feminists Blocking Highway at 1:30 in Morning[204] Two women activists were hit by a car in downtown Seattle early in the morning on July 4th.

'I want to take down all statues of people who owned slaves in this country,' Horowitz told potential signatories, emphasizing how he wanted to remove the statue of George Washington in DC. All of the people featured in the video gleefully signed the petition to take down statues of 'slave owners' like Washington and Jefferson. However, when it came to another infamous historical slave owner, their enthusiasm suddenly waned.[209] Video: Joe Biden Struggles to Say 'America First'[210] A video clip shows Joe Biden struggling to say 'America First,' leading to speculation as to whether he is hostile to the phrase or just forgot the words. Speaking about Trump, Biden stated, 'This guy's whole idea of America,' before pausing. 'America on its own has meant America alone, we're out there by ourselves.'[211] Video: Shots Fired at Portland Protest After Driver Gets Caught in Mob[212] Throughout the past seven weeks of non stop protests that often devolve into riots, we've seen several drivers hit the gas and drive through the violent antifa and BLM terrorists when their cars get caught up in the chaos, while others have been pulled from their cars and beaten. One terrorist even made a video on how to break car windows and slice seat belts so the mobs can more easily pull drivers out and beat them. Early Thursday morning in Portland, one guy ended up driving into the protest, and can be seen firing off warning shots as he drives away![213] Violent Leftist Mob Riots, Vandalizes District Attorney's Office, Pepper-Sprays Police After Shooting Death of Bernardo Palacios-Carbajal Ruled Justified[214] Violent leftists are out destroying public property, shutting down streets, rioting and pepper-spraying police tonight in Salt Lake City.

Meanwhile, Michel Barnier has hinted that the EU is ready to grant the City of London access to European markets after the transition period. Britain's prime minister has told the chancellor of Germany that the United Kingdom would leave the EU Single Market and Customs Union to trade with the bloc on the same terms as Australia. While Australia does not have a free trade agreement with the EU has individual deals in place for specific goods.[227] British Universities Comply With Chinese Internet Censorship[228] British universities are engaging with a Chinese online platform so that its learning materials comply with China's repressive internet regulations.

Prime Minister Igor Matovic thus signaled a possible tightening of coronavirus restrictions, but has not yet announced any specific measures. '53 new cases. Too much to continue to rely solely on people's responsibility. Unfortunately,' Matovic wrote on his Facebook profile. On Wednesday, 2,284 tests were performed in Slovakia. The largest number of infections was detected in the towns of Presov (12), Bratislava and Cadca (9), and in Kosice (5). Currently, seven people are hospitalized, three of them in ICU and one patient is connected to an artificial lung ventilator.[231] Duda: I Want a Poland That Protects the Weak and Doesn't Fear the Strong[232] During his rally in Wieliczka (South Poland), president Andrzej Duda said that Poland is a country whose democracy is becoming increasingly grounded and this shows itself in the high turnout in the last elections. Duda underlined that the upcoming elections will decide whether Polish policy will be directed at ordinary people and families, or whether it will support only the elite.

'The left-liberal majority of the European Parliament is using every means in order to link the transfer of the Union's development funds to so-called rule of law criteria,' Deutsch said. 'The latest example for this is that they want funds from the multiannual financial framework [or MFF, the EU's seven-year budget] and the recovery fund both linked to this. [] the idea would in essence create a tool for blackmail by blocking access to convergence funds.'[239] Hungary Shores Up Defenses as Coronavirus Cases Mount Elsewhere in Europe[240] Hungary has successfully fought off the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic and new infections are now few, but the country is drawing plans to defend itself from new peaks in several other European countries, including some of its neighbors, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said in his weekly interview with Kossuth Radió on Friday morning. 'We have defeated the first wave of the infection, now we are busy with mitigating the economic consequences and creating new jobs,' Orban said, adding that data from other European countries is very worrying. 'The numbers are sad. [] New infections have increased tenfold in Croatia within the space of two weeks and fourfold in Serbia. Even in Slovenia, which has been the most successful in its defense so far, the risk of infection from outside is growing.'[241] Hungarian Hotels and Online Accommodation Sites Fight for Guests[242] In a tourist market slowly recovering from the coronavirus pandemic, hotels conducting legitimate businesses and as yet unregulated online accommodation services are fighting for guests, tourism portal turizmus.com reports. While several such services offering accommodation in Hungary, the current focus in the country is Californian based Airbnb, which is the most widespread in the country, offering 14,000 residences in Budapest alone. Complaints against them are the same as in many other parts of the world, such as driving up rental prices for local residents, excessive noise and general unruliness. Airbnb is currently entirely unregulated in Hungary and the biggest trouble spot is downtown Budapest's 7th district, the so-called 'party district', a popular destination for bachelor parties and a weekend partying destination for Western European tourists.[243] Hungary Increases 2021 Defense Budget by 30 Percent[244] The Hungarian Armed Forces will see its 2021 budget increased by a massive 30 percent to HUF 778 billion (€2.2 billion), in order to cope with its increased workload caused by the coronavirus pandemic and to continue provoding a high-level defense to the country's borders under migration pressure, Defense Minister Tibor Benko said on the M1 national television channel. In the interview, Benko said next year's central budget will be primarily geared towards family support and rebooting the Hungarian economy, but national security will also be in focus.[245] Most Spectacular Roof in Europe Reaches Structural Completion[246] The House of Hungarian Music, one of several cultural venues currently under construction in Budapest's famous Varosliget city park is now structurally complete, Laszló Baan, government commissioner in charge of the project announced on Thursday. 'With the completion of the upper level, the House of Hungarian Music is now structurally finished,' Baan said. 'The construction is continuing according to plan with erecting the continuous glass front, as high as 12 meters in some parts, which will be the largest of its kind in Europe.'[247] Poland and Slovakia Tighten Military Aviation Cooperation[248] After his meeting with minister of defense Mariusz Blaszczak in Warsaw, Slovakian minister of national defense Jaroslav Nad declared that the relations between Poland and Slovakia are excellent and new initiatives are deepening cooperation.

From Friday, people from three different households will be able to meet indoors for the first time since March, in groups of up to eight. And in a move that paves the way for large-scale family reunions this weekend, groups of up to 15 people, from five separate households, will be able to meet up outdoors as long as social distancing rules are followed. With the country entering the third of four stages of easing lockdown, Ms Sturgeon confirmed that pubs, restaurants and cafes will be able to reopen indoor areas from Wednesday next week, when communal worship can also resume[255] Top UK Scientist Equates 'Antisocial' Refusal to Wear a Mask to Drink Driving[256] Head of the Royal Society Venki Ramakrishnan said it was time to normalise mask-wearing and treat those who do not as social pariahs who risk lives as much as drink drivers. 'It used to be quite normal to have quite a few drinks and drive home, and it also used to be normal to drive without seatbelts,' Prof Ramakrishnan.[257] UK: BBC Forces Elderly to Pay TV Tax While Throwing Millions Into 'Diverse' Content[258] The BBC will go ahead with its plans to scrap the free licence fee for the majority of over-75s to save money, while pledging to spend 100 million on 'diverse' content to appease the Marxist Black Lives Matter movement. The move had been delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic, but the broadcaster announced on Thursday that from August 1st, three million more households would be expected to pay the 157.50 annual fee. Britain's poorest seniors will still be able to apply for an exemption to the licence.[259] UK: Farage: Marxist BLM Has Agenda That 'Would Make Lenin Blush'[260] Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage has said that the people behind Black Lives Matter have an agenda that 'would make Lenin blush', warning that the movement does not want racial justice but seeks to tear down Western civilisation. Speaking to supporters during a Facebook live stream on Thursday, Mr Farage remarked on the speed with which Black Lives Matter hijacked the death of black American George Floyd for its own purposes.[261] UK: Islamist Acquitted for Sword Attack Outside Buckingham Palace Jailed for Terror Plot on Gay Pride Festival[262] A jihadist who was acquitted in 2018 of terrorism after attacking a police officer with a sword outside of Buckingham Palace while yelling 'Allah hu Akbar' has been jailed for a terror plot to attack London's gay pride festival. Mohiussunnath Chowdhury, 28, from Luton, was found guilty in February on plotting deadly terror attacks on London landmarks including Madam Tussauds, an iconic open-top double-decker sightseeing bus, and the gay pride festival.[263] UK: Statue of Scouts Founder Who Fought African Slaver King Freed From Protective Case After BLM Threats[264] The statue of scouts founder Robert Baden-Powell, who led an expedition to end the enslavement of Africans by the Ashanti king, has been released from its protective casing, a month after Marxist Black Lives Matter activists threatened to tear it down over claims he was a racist and supported the Nazis. The local council had initially planned to remove the Poole quayside statue in early June after it appeared on a hitlist of memorials across the country to be targetted because they allegedly glorified the Empire or racism.[265] Wales to Prepare a Massive Audit of Statues and Street Names[266] In connection with the so-called fight against racism, unleashed by the Black Lives Matter movement, Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford has decided to declare a major audit of the names of statues, streets, and buildings in the country. The goal is to examine and reveal how colonialism and slavery reflect in names throughout the state. Drakeford's cabinet announced it on its website. The review process will be led by Gaynor Legall, a well-known Welsh women's rights activist for various minorities. A group of experts on slavery, the history of the British Empire, and the history of Black communities in Wales will assist her on this task.[267] Coronavirus: Serbia Scraps Curfew Plan for Belgrade After Protests[268] The Serbian government has scrapped a plan to impose a weekend coronavirus curfew in Belgrade after two nights of protests in the capital. Prime Minister Ana Brnabic announced more limited measures, including a ban on gatherings of more than 10 people. President Aleksandar Vucic had wanted the curfew due to a rise in infections.[269] President Vucic: Serban Protests Politically Motivated[270] The Serbian capital Belgrade and a few regional cities have for the second day running been disturbed by violent protests against President Aleksandar Vucic's plan to reintroduce a weekend curfew as the country is faced with a resurgence in coronavirus numbers. Protests began Tuesday night in Belgrade, after President Aleksandar Vucic announced earlier that day that in view of the worsening coronavirus infection numbers he will reintroduce a weekend curfew.

According to him, no contacts with the Czech officials are planned in the near future. According to Interfax, Peskov answered journalists' questions about relations with the Czech Republic on the background of espionage scandals. According to Prime Minister Andrej Babis, Czechia is interested in normal relations with Russia and approaches mutual consultations very responsibly. 'Relations with the Czech Republic have recently been marred by well-known events, certain hostile steps taken at the level of municipal and central authorities. Undoubtedly, this has generally affected our bilateral relations,' a spokesman for President Vladimir Putin told reporters in response to a question on how he would characterize relations with the Czech Republic.[273] India: Student Researchers Discover New Species of Marine Invertebrate[274] A scientist from the Centre for Climate Change Studies at the Sathyabama Institute of Science and Technology and two of his students have identified a new species of marine invertebrate. The researchers' work has been published in Zootaxa, a peer-reviewed journal based in New Zealand. S. Prakash, scientist, said that his M. Tech. students M.S. Vignesh and Ruchi P. Jain had been collecting seaweed along the coast of Tamil Nadu for the past two years. 'The worm, Tetrastemma freyae, is associated with sediments and is predatory as it has a role in maintaining the food chain. It feeds on dead and decaying material and helps to recycle nutrients in coastal and deep water sediments. The worm uses its proboscis just as a butterfly does to collect nectar,' he said. [Comment: The article further states that the species might be useful for medicine.][275] Amid Geopolitical Chaos, TikTok Mysteriously Goes Down Across US &#38; UK[276] With the social media company caught in the middle of the escalating rhetorical battle between US and China, 'conspiracy' theories are running rampant as TikTok suddenly goes down across the US and UK. The outage began around 1400ET [Comment: Article dated July 9, 2020.][277] Black TikTok Creators Have Long Accused the Platform of Censorship[278] TikTok, the wildly popular Chinese video-sharing app has long been accused of having a race problem. While the company is also under fire for privacy problems, with countries such as India banning it already and the US being concerned about user privacy, there have also been accusations of racial bias against the company. Marc Faddoul, an artificial intelligence researcher, first brought more solid evidence to this idea at the start of the year and stated that there may be a potential glitch in TikTok that may end up fostering racial bias in its algorithm that causes it to censor black people. Faddoul, in a series of tweets, further revealed his findings.[279] Chinese Banks Preparing for 'Worst Case' Scenario: Being Cut Off From Swift, Hong Kong Bank Runs[280] In the latest escalation over China's de facto annexation of Hong Kong, Reuters reports that Chinese state lenders are 'revamping contingency plans' in anticipation of the soon to be enacted U.S. legislation (just waiting for Trump's signature) that would penalize banks for serving officials who implement the new national security law for Hong Kong. In a 'worst-case scenario' under consideration by Chinese commercial megabanks Bank of China and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), the lenders are said to be looking at the possibility of being cut off from U.S. dollars or losing access to U.S. dollar settlements, two Reuters sources said. The worst-case scenario also envisions what would happen in the event of a run on its branches in Hong Kong if customers feared that it would run out of U.S. currency, one of the sources said (this is the scenario discussed in 'If 500,000 Rich Hong Kongers Leave The City, The HKD Peg Would Surely Collapse'). The scenario was also looking at the experience of banks in Iran, the same person said. Iranian banks have been hit from time to time by U.S. sanctions dating back to the 1979 Islamic Revolution.[281] Hong Kong Schools Must Ensure 'Patriotic' Content &#38; Remove Books Breaching China Security Law[282] Things in Hong Kong have rapidly gone straight Orwellian very quickly after the July 1 enactment of the new national security law. As we detailed this week activists are busy scrubbing their digital footprints, including deleting social media profiles and chat histories, given authorities can reportedly pry citizens' online communications from internet companies without a warrant under the law. But it's not just college-age and 'professional demonstrators' and pro-independence organizers that have to worry, as noweven schools have been ordered to review textual content in books. This means teachers and young students are coming under threat if they don't visibly and 'positively' conform.[283] U.S. Sanctions 4 Chinese Officials Over Human Rights Abuses Against Uighur Muslims[284] The U.S. Treasury Department announced Thursday that the Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned four Chinese Communist Party officials and the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau over human rights abuses against the Uighur Muslim minority.[285] Australia Suspends Extradition Treaty With Hong Kong Over Security Law, China Vows Retaliation[286] Following Canada's move last week, Australia has announced it is suspending its extradition treaty with Hong Kong amid a build-up in tensions related to the new Beijing-imposed national security law cracking down on anti-mainland dissent. 'Our government, together with other governments around the world, have been very consistent in expressing our concerns about the imposition of the national security law on Hong Kong,' Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Thursday. 'Today we have agreed to announce that that national security law constitutes a fundamental change of circumstances in respect to our extradition agreement with Hong Kong.'[287] Cancer Patient Who Refused to Give a Smoker a Cigarette is Brutally Beaten Outside a Hospital as His IV Tubes Are Ripped From His Body[288] The 35-year-old man was allegedly thrown to the ground, kicked in the stomach, and had his IV tubes pulled out in the unprovoked attack at about 10.15am on Friday morning.[289] Chinese Student Studying in Australia Was Targeted by the CCP After Speaking Out[290] China is often known for stifling free speech and preventing its citizens from expressing criticism against the country's government online. Suppressing the opinions of its citizens doesn't seem enough to satisfy the Chinese government, as it is now keen on making people with Chinese ethnicity living elsewhere in the world from expressing critical opinions about the country and its governance. How is China achieving this herculean task? It is just mimicking an age-old, ancient idea known as 'zhulian' that can be best defined as 'implication' or 'guilt by association.' Simply put, the police in China end up threatening the family members for the actions performed by their relatives living in foreign nations. Known by her Twitter handle @HorrorZoo, a Chinese student pursuing a graduate program in Australia has revealed that her father back in China has to appear in the police station fairly often as he was summoned by the police for his daughter's critical comments on the Chinese Communist Party.[291] How a Mammoth KFC Order Overheard by Paramedics Led to 16 Lockdown-Breakers Being Fined $26,000 for Attending 'Unacceptable' House Party in Melbourne[292] Paramedics were enjoying their KFC meal at the fast food restaurant in Dandenong in Melbourne about 1.30am on Friday when they spotted two people ordering 20 meals.[293] Militant Vegan Serial Protester Covered in Fake Blood and Carrying a Fake Pig's Head Storms a Busy McDonald's Restaurant to Scream at Customers for Eating Meat[294] Tash Peterson, dressed in a bloodied apron with a fake butchered pig's head under her arm and wearing a face mask, made her protest at the Western Australia fast food restaurant on Friday.[295] New Species of 'Walking' Sharks Discovered in Australia[296] Walking sharks sounds like something you'd see in a preview for Sharknado 8: Nowhere Is Safe, but it's apparently a totally real thing, and researchers have discovered a handful of species in recent years that have seemingly evolved the ability. Scientists have known about sharks that have the ability to 'walk' with their fins on dry land for a while, but in researching the known species they discovered four species that have apparently developed the ability much more recently. The research was published in the journal Marine &#38; Freshwater Research and it suggests that sharks may gain some big advantages by being able to slink along the seafloor rather than swimming. The walking sharks tend to appear in roughly the same area, which happens to be in the waters off of Northern Australia. They're typically smaller in size — you won't spot a great white shark walking along the bottom of the ocean any time soon — and it appears to help the sharks hunt for ground-dwelling prey.[297] Victoria is Hit With 288 New Cases of Coronavirus — the Worst Ever Figure for an Australian State — as Dan Andrews Warns Locked Down Melbourne That it's Going to Get Worse[298] Victoria has recorded 288 new coronavirus cases, its biggest spike since coronavirus pandemic began.[299] Jihadist Group Kills 25 People in DRC's Ituri Province[300] A group of jihadist militiamen on Wednesday killed at least 25 people in the Ituri province located in the Democratic Republic of Congo's northeastern region.

At elevations of 12,000 feet, some patches of cloud forest linger, blanketing the rocky ground and grasslands. Scattered across those grasslands are stones, surrounded by moss and lichens. And hidden beneath those stones are small, brownish-grey frogs with short limbs and stout bodies. They don't live near water, so they never begin life as tadpoles. Instead, they hatch directly out of the eggs as froglets. These unique frogs may have existed under those stones for centuries. But they were unknown to science — until now.[305] Canada Loses Track of 35,000 Migrants Set for Deportation[306] The Canadian government has admitted that it has lost track of two-thirds of the 50,000 migrants targeted for deportation orders, most of them failed asylum seekers.

On February 27, Erdogan's government was on the threshold of executing its threat to flood Europe with millions of (mostly Syrian) migrants and opening its northwestern borders with Greece and Bulgaria. Hundreds of thousands of migrants began flocking to the border. In a few days, by the beginning of March, they would be in EU territory, to be followed by hundreds of thousands of others. Things, however, did not go as planned by Ankara. By the next day, Greece was not only operating 52 Navy ships to guard its islands close to Turkey; it had also mobilized additional troops on land. Its security forces were able to block 10,000 migrants from entering Greece by way of the Turkish land border. Some migrants were stuck in the no-man's land between the two countries and eventually had to return to the Turkish side. Greek officials reportedonly 76 illegal entries, whom they detained and prosecuted. In his social media account, Turkey's Deputy Foreign Minister Yavuz Selim Kiran compared the alleged treatment of migrants seeking to cross illegally into Greece with conditions at Nazi death camps at Auschwitz. The Central Board of Jewish Communities in Greece immediately condemned and denounced the statement.[317] Documents Confirm 43 Planned Parenthood Clinics Illegitimately Received COVID-19 Relief Funds[318] A total of 43 Planned Parenthood affiliates received emergency federal aid intended to keep small businesses afloat during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to documents released Monday by the Small Business Administration. The amount of aid varied from $150,000 up to $10 million. In total, Planned Parenthood received somewhere between $65.8 million and $135 million from the CARES Act Paycheck Protection Program.

Rules for the loans mandated that companies had to employ fewer than 500 people. Planned Parenthood employs more than 16,000 nationwide with assets totaling over $2 billion.[319] Kanye West Tweets Images of Unborn Babies With Words 'These Souls Deserve to Live, ' Deletes an Hour Later[320] Self-proclaimed presidential candidate Kanye West posted pictures of 6-month-old unborn babies to Twitter on Wednesday along with the words, 'These souls deserve to live.'

The decision comes less than a year after it was Urban Dictionary's turn to come under some corporate media scrutiny and the site started getting media attention for its 'problematic' content. Some of the definitions there 'aren't entirely accurate,' Wired observedback in September of 2019. And what was once a fun site, informative of the latest slang terms and trends had now become, according to Wired, a toxic place filled with hate speech — apparently because it's 'open to anyone.' It doesn't say it explicitly, but this piece that digs into Urban Dictionary's roots and role simply longs for some censorship and better and more gatekeeping.[331] Spotify Experiencing Global Outage; 1000s of Users Report App Crashing Immediately After Launch[332] Popular music-streaming service Spotify is currently struggling with a global outage that is impacting almost all of its markets in Europe, along with the American northeast, and parts of Australia and South America.

 Summary 
The white Atlanta police officer who fatally shot Rayshard Brooks was charged with murder. Another officer who was involved in the killing faces three charges, including aggravated assault and violation of oath.
Former national security adviser John Bolton alleges that Trump tried to halt criminal investigations as ""personal favors"" to dictators and asked China for re-election help in his upcoming book. Democrats have sized the revelations as more evidence to support Trump's impeachment but have also criticized Bolton for declining to testify during the impeachment inquiry.
Joe Biden accused Donald Trump of surrendering the fight against coronavirus said that the president ""sold out"" the US in allegedly asking China for re-election help. Biden said Trump had violated a ""sacred duty"" to the American people.
Officials in Tulsa, Oklahoma, worried that the president's plan to hold a huge political indoor rally in the city on Saturday will inflame racial tensions and put people at risk of catching coronavirus. Some have urged Trump to postpone the event. The city's Republican mayor said that it was an ""honor"" to host the president, but said he would not be attending the rally.
A CDC report found that nearly 70% of 220 patients hospitalized in Atlanta were Black. With cases rising in some parts of the nation as cities reopen bars, restaurants, and other public venues, the pandemic continues to expose deeply entrenched inequalities.

 Joe Biden, in response to the allegation that Trump asked China for help getting re-elected, said that the president ""sold out the American people to protect his political future"". 
Here's more from Biden: 
Today, we learned from John Bolton, the President's former national security advisor, that President Trump sold out the American people to protect his political future. He reportedly directly asked Xi Jinping, China's leader, to help him get re-elected. He was willing to trade away our most cherished democratic values for the empty promise of a flimsy trade deal that bailed him out of his disastrous tariff war that did so much damage to our farmers, manufacturers, and consumers. 
If these accounts are true, it's not only morally repugnant, it's a violation of Donald Trump's sacred duty to the American people to protect America's interests and defend our values. 
Democrats have seized on allegations that Trump requested political help from China, emphasizing evidence to support having impeached Trump. 
Here's Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer : 
enltrIt was clear then and could not be any clearer now: the vote to convict and remove Donald Trump from office was absolutely the right vote. The revelations in Bolton's book make Senate Republicans' craven actions on impeachment look even worse-and history will judge them for it.
- Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) June 17, 2020
But as Elizabeth Warren pointed out, any revelations in Bolton's book have come too late. Bolton declined to testify during the impeachment inquiry last year. 
enltrIt shouldn't take a book deal for members of this administration to come clean about impeachable offenses they witnessed from Trump. There's a reason he thinks he's above the law. Those around him-from his cabinet to Republicans in Congress-have failed to hold him accountable.

The pro-police protesters were carrying ""Thin Blue Line"" American flags, which defenders have said represent a solemn tribute to fallen officers. But the flag has also been criticized as a symbol of white supremacy, appearing next to the confederate flag at the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville. 
Per witnesses at the rally in Boston today, someone carrying the Thin Blue Line flag spat at a passing car with a Black driver, and police escorted the driver away.

 Officers were instructed not to use body cameras during the raid of journalist Bryan Carmody's home, in a San Francisco police department memo obtained by the nonprofit Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. 
 In the memo, lieutenant Pilar Torres said officers conducting the raid should ""lieutenant Pilar Torres states that he told law enforcement officers conducting the raid ""not to utilize our department issued BWC's [body worn cameras] for this operation"" to avoid compromising the ""confidential investigation"". 
San Francisco has reached a $369,000 settlement with Carmody. Officers raided the freelance journalist's home in 2019 and seized notebooks and other materials after he refused to disclose the source who shared a confidential police report on the death of a San Francisco public defender. 
The case is receiving renewed interest amid the new revelations and amid increased scrutiny over the police's treatment of journalists covering the recent protests against police brutality.

 CDC report: in Atlanta, Black coronavirus patients were much more likely to be hospitalized than white patients 
In March and April, out of 220 coronavirus patients who were hospitalized, 79% were Black. Older Black men made up 52% of those hospitalized. By comparison, 13% of hospitalized patients were white, per the report published Wednesday. 
The unequal toll of the coronavirus pandemic on Black and minority communities has now been well documented throughout the country. A previous CDC report found that more than 80% of patients hospitalized with Covid-19 in Georgia were Black. 
As the state has loosened restrictions and increased testing, the number of cases reported has increased in four of the past five weeks.

 Several nooses were found hanging on trees in Oakland, California, the latest in a spate of racist, anti-black related crimes under investigation across the state. 
Police are investigating the nooses as a hate crime. They were found in the Lake Merritt area, a popular outdoor space and neighborhood.
""Symbols of racial violence have no place in Oakland and will not be tolerated,"" Oakland's mayor, Libby Schaaf, said in a statement. ""We are all responsible for knowing the history and present day reality of lynchings, hate crimes and racial violence. Objects that invoke such terror will not be tolerated in Oakland's public spaces.""
Schaaf noted that there were some reports that the nooses might have been hung as part of exercise equipment, but that does not ""remove nor excuse their torturous and terrorizing effects"".
The discovery of the nooses comes on the heels of investigations into the hanging deaths of two black men in southern California.
Robert Fuller, 24, was found dead hanging from a tree near Palmdale city hall in the early hours of 10 June. The county medical examiner initially labeled the preliminary cause of death as suicide pending a full autopsy, noting the lack of evidence of foul play. But following widespread outcry, the coroner deferred the decision and the Los Angeles county sheriff announced that the FBI and the state attorney general's office will be monitoring the investigation.
Ten days earlier, 38-year-old Malcolm Harsch was found dead hanging from a tree in front of the Victorville public library in San Bernardino county, about 50 miles away from where Fuller was found dead.

 Today is the fifth anniversary of the Charleston massacre when white supremacist Dylann Roof murdered nine people at Emanuel AME church. 
Despite a South Carolina law protecting monuments, officials in Charleston announced that they will remove a statute of John C Calhoun, a former vice-president and advocate for slavery. 
Mayor John Tecklenburg announced that he will send a resolution to the city council to have the statue taken down. To do so is ""not to erase our long and often tragic history but to begin to write a new and more equitable future"", he said.

 Keisha Lance Bottoms, the Atlanta mayor, told The View that though she's ""encouraged"" by Donald Trump's executive order on police reform, ""it's hard to take him seriously in this moment."" 
Bottoms, who has found herself on a shortlist of contenders to be Joe Biden's running mate, said he was disappointed that the president's executive order didn't address racial bias in policing. 
""We don't have another minute to spare. We convened an advisory task force in Atlanta to look at our use of force policies, and not three days later, then Rayshard Brooks was killed in Atlanta,"" she said. ""We don't have time for the theatrics. We've gotta have action right now and we needed it yesterday.""

 Biden accuses Trump of ""surrendering"" nation to coronavirus 
Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, on Wednesday laced into Donald Trump over his handling of the coronavirus, accusing him of ""surrendering the fight"" against the Covid-19 outbreak as more than a dozen US states experience sharp rises in reported cases. ""He's waived a white flag, and has retreated,"" Biden said.

 He accused the administration of ""engaging in self-congratulations"" when the number of deaths each month still exceeds the number of war dead in World War II. ""Just like he couldn't wish Covid-19 away in March, just like he couldn't tweet it away in April, he can't ignore it away in June,"" Biden said. ""Mr President, wake up. Get to work,"" he said in closing. ""There's so much more to be done."" Biden began his remarks by marking the fifth anniversary of the Charleston massacre, when a white supremecist murdered nine black parishioners as they prayed. Biden, who was vice president at the time, said he continues to marvel at their ""amazing grace"" and capacity to forgive the perpetrator of what he called a ""poisonous expression of white supremacy that still infects our nation and many of our institutions."" But, acknowledging the ongoing protests against racism and police brutality, he said ""grace alone is not enough.""

 The New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio, announced that the city is launching an online database that will let New Yorkers track disciplinary cases against police officers accused of excessive force and other violations and view their administrative records. 
The New York police department will also adopt tighter deadlines to speed up the disciplinary process, the mayor said, according to the latest from the Associated Press.

The reforms are meant to bring more transparency to a system long criticized for being too secretive and plagued by lengthy delays in holding police officers accountable for misconduct.
""We have to know that if something's done right, it will be recognized and when something's done wrong, it will be acted on,"" De Blasio said. ""When people know that, that's what helps them have greater faith."" 
He added: ""I want everything we have to be put on online.""
The move drew a swift rebuke from the head of the Police Benevolent Association, the city's largest police union, who said it undermines privacy protections. Lynch also labeled the measures to expedite cases ""arbitrary"" and vulnerable to predetermined outcomes driven by politics. The announcement from De Blasio, who ran for the Democratic nomination for president in the 2020 election, but did not prevail, follows decisions in recent days to make officers' body-camera footage more widely available and to disband a plainclothes anti-crime unit that critics said was too aggressive.
Last week, state governor Andrew Cuomo also signed legislation barring the NYPD and other police departments in the state from keeping the public in the dark about disciplinary records.

 Donald Trump set out a plan on Wednesday aimed at helping to prevent suicides by US military veterans, which he described as a ""tremendous problem"". ""Ending the tragedy of veteran suicide demands bold action at every level of society,"" the president said in the east room of the White House. ""Twenty veterans and service members take their own lives every single day. The loss of our heroes breaks our hearts and pains our souls."" Trump announced 10 recommendations, including providing suicide prevention training and enhancing research, and a public health awareness campaign led by Second Lady Karen Pence, who said: ""We're all dealing with anxiety. We're all dealing with stress right now so, if I can do anything as lead ambassador, it's my goal to help take away the stigma of mental health."" The initiative is called The President's Roadmap to Empower Veterans and End a National Tragedy of Suicide, or PREVENTS, and had been delayed for three months by the coronavirus pandemic. Although Trump stayed mostly on-script, he could not resist a swipe at his predecessor, Barack Obama, and his 2020 election rival, Joe Biden. ""After years of shameful scandal and neglect under the Obama-Biden administration, and scandal and neglect it was, we have fundamentally reorganised the VA [Department of Veterans Affairs] from top to bottom,"" he said. The remarks occurred at the same time as a speech by Biden in Pennsylvania. All three major cable news networks - CNN, Fox News and MSNBC - gave live coverage to the former vice president instead of Trump. The president's relationship with the military has been strained by his aggressive reaction to the protests against racial injustice in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

 John Bolton 's allegation that Donald Trump asked Xi Jinping to help him win his re-election campaign, reported by the Washington Post, flies in the face of Trump's anti-China campaign rhetoric. 
Trump's reelection campaign is currently running hundreds of ads attacking his Democratic rival Joe Biden as being too soft on China. The ads variously portray Biden as a puppet of Xi, hugging China, and wearing a red hat with the slogan ""Make China Great Again"". Video spots reference the Chinese origins of the coronavirus pandemic and appear designed to invoke xenophobia, fear, and anger at Chinese trade policies.

During a meeting with Xi in June 2019, Trump ""turned the conversation to the coming US presidential election, alluding to China's economic capability to affect the ongoing campaigns, pleading with Xi to ensure he'd win"", Bolton writes in his book, according to the Washington Post. 
""He stressed the importance of farmers, and increased Chinese purchases of soybeans and wheat in the electoral outcome. I would print Trump's exact words but the government's prepublication review process has decided otherwise.""

In a book excerpt provided to the Wall Street Journal, John Bolton claims Trump ""nodded apporvingly"" when Chinese President Xi Jinping suggested the US held ""too many elections.""
Bolton writes:
 In Buenos Aires on Dec. 1, at dinner, Xi began by telling Trump how wonderful he was, laying it on thick. Xi read steadily through note cards, doubtless all of it hashed out arduously in advance. Trump ad-libbed, with no one on the U.S. side knowing what he would say from one minute to the next. 
One highlight came when Xi said he wanted to work with Trump for six more years, and Trump replied that people were saying that the two-term constitutional limit on presidents should be repealed for him. Xi said the U.S. had too many elections, because he didn't want to switch away from Trump, who nodded approvingly.

The Wall Street Journal has published an excerpt from John Bolton 's upcoming book, which includes a claim that Trump encouraged the Chinese president to continue building concentration camps for the country's Uighur citizens.
Bolton writes in the excerpt for the Journal :
 At the opening dinner of the Osaka G-20 meeting in June 2019, with only interpreters present, Xi [Jinping] had explained to Trump why he was basically building concentration camps in Xinjiang. According to our interpreter, Trump said that Xi should go ahead with building the camps, which Trump thought was exactly the right thing to do. The National Security Council's top Asia staffer, Matthew Pottinger, told me that Trump said something very similar during his November 2017 trip to China.
Up to 1 million Uigh ur citizens have disappeared into Chinese re-education camps, prompting outcry from human rights groups. Beijing has claimed the camps are meant to stamp out extremism.

The Washington Post has also obtained a copy of John Bolton 's book, in which the former national security adviser reportedly claims Trump asked Chinese President Xi Jinping for help in winning reelection.
The Post reports :
 During a one-on-one meeting at the June 2019 Group of 20 summit in Japan, Xi complained to Trump about China critics in the United States. But Bolton writes in a book scheduled to be released next week that 'Trump immediately assumed Xi meant the Democrats. Trump said approvingly that there was great hostility among the Democrats. 
'He then, stunningly, turned the conversation to the coming U.S. presidential election, alluding to China's economic capability to affect the ongoing campaigns, pleading with Xi to ensure he'd win,' Bolton writes. 'He stressed the importance of farmers, and increased Chinese purchases of soybeans and wheat in the electoral outcome. I would print Trump's exact words but the government's prepublication review process has decided otherwise.'
That last sentence is particularly noteworthy, considering the Trump administration is claiming Bolton's book cannot be released because it contains classified information. 
The administration also alleged Bolton backed out of a review process for the book, but Bolton's lawyer has accused the White House of exploiting the standard review process in an effort to prevent the publication of unflattering anecdotes about the president.

 John Bolton reportedly accuses House Democrats of committing ""impeachment malpractice"" by focusing solely on the Ukraine controversy in their inquiry against Trump in his upcoming book.
The New York Times reports :
 The book confirms House testimony that Mr. Bolton was wary all along of the president's actions with regard to Ukraine and that Mr. Trump explicitly linked the security aid to investigations involving [Joe] Biden and Hillary Clinton.... 
Mr. Bolton, however, had nothing for scorn for the House Democrats who impeached Mr. Trump, saying they committed 'impeachment malpractice' by limiting their inquiry to the Ukraine matter and moving too quickly for their own political reasons. Instead, he said they should have also looked at how Mr. Trump was willing to intervene in investigations into companies like Turkey's Halkbank to curry favor with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey or China's ZTE to favor President Xi Jinping.
Mr. Bolton also recounts a discussion at the Group of 20 summit meeting in Osaka, Japan, last summer at which the president overtly linked policy to his own political fortunes as he asked Mr. Xi to buy a lot of American agricultural products to help him win farm states in this year's election. Mr. Trump, he writes, was 'pleading with Xi to ensure he'd win. He stressed the importance of farmers, and increased Chinese purchases of soybeans and wheat in the electoral outcome.'

According to the New York Times, John Bolton 's book includes numerous unflattering anecdotes about Trump and recounts episodes of senior aides mocking the president.
The Times reports :
 It is a withering portrait of a president ignorant of even basic facts about the world, susceptible to transparent flattery by authoritarian leaders manipulating him and prone to false statements, foul-mouthed eruptions and snap decisions that aides try to manage or reverse. 
Mr. Trump did not seem to know, for example, that Britain is a nuclear power and asked if Finland is part of Russia, Mr. Bolton writes. He came closer to withdrawing the United States from NATO than previously known. Even top advisers who position themselves as unswervingly loyal mock him behind his back. During Mr. Trump's 2018 meeting with North Korea's leader, according to the book, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo slipped Mr. Bolton a note disparaging the president, saying, 'He is so full of shit.'
That closing anecdote could cause trouble for Pompeo, considering the president is notoriously sensitive to any indication that his advisers are criticizing or mocking him.

 Bolton says Trump tried to halt criminal investigations to help dictators - report 
In his upcoming book, former national security adviser John Bolton reportedly argues Trump should have been impeached for more than just the Ukraine controversy, claiming the president tried to halt criminal investigations as ""personal favors"" to dictators.
The New York Times reports :
 Mr. Bolton describes several episodes where the president expressed willingness to halt criminal investigations 'to, in effect, give personal favors to dictators he liked,' citing cases involving major firms in China and Turkey. 'The pattern looked like obstruction of justice as a way of life, which we couldn't accept,' Mr. Bolton writes, adding that he reported his concerns to Attorney General William P. Barr. 
The book is set to be published next week, but the administration has filed a civil lawsuit against Bolton in an effort to block the book's release.

 Tulsa health official: Trump rally should be postponed 
White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany has just concluded her briefing, during which she was pressed on the Trump campaign's decision to move ahead with its Tulsa rally this weekend.
As McEnany was speaking, Tulsa's mayor held a press conference about the upcoming rally, and a senior city health official said he believed the event should be postponed out of concern about the spread of coronavirus.
""I recommended it be postponed until it's safer,"" said Dr Bruce Dart, the executive director of the Tulsa health department. ""We're concerned."" 
But McEnany dismissed reporters' questions about the safety of the rally, accusing the press of a double standard when it comes to covering large events. 
She said news reports have not highlighted health concerns about the recent protests against police brutality, although such events are outdoors and thus pose a lower risk of coronavirus spread, according to health experts.

 White House revisiting renaming bases named after Confederate generals - report 
The White House is reportedly revisiting the idea of renaming military bases named after Confederate generals, which the president previously ruled out.
NBC News reports :
 Conversations among White House officials in recent days about renaming the bases have been spurred by a growing recognition in the West Wing that the names of the bases will eventually be changed - with or without Trump 's backing - given widespread support for the idea and the momentum it has gained in Congress even among lawmakers from the president's own party. So White House officials are debating whether Trump should support a process for renaming them in order for him to have a say in who they are named after, officials said. 
The officials said Trump is aware the conversations are taking place.
Trump previously said he would ""not even consider"" renaming the bases, but an amendment laying out a plan to rename the bases within three years has been added to the annual defense authorization act.
If the amendment remains in the final version of the bill, which seems likely, Trump would have to veto the defense legislation to block the renaming proposal. Such a move would likely spark criticism from members of both parties, considering the bill also includes a number of spending provisions that are popular with the Pentagon.

One of the most substantial differences is that the House bill explictly bans certain policing practices, such as chokeholds and no-knock warrants. The Senate bill, on the other hand, incentivizes police departments to ban such practices through the distribution of federal funds.
 Democrats have said the Republican bill, as well as the executive order signed by Trump yesterday, do not go far enough to address officers' misconduct. 
Meanwhile, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has said Democrats are trying to ""federalize"" policing and has made clear that the House bill has no future in the Senate.

 The Guardian's Sam Levine provides an update on a controversial voter fraud case in Texas: 
 Crystal Mason, the Texas woman sentenced to five years in prison for illegally voting even though she didn't know she was ineligible, is asking a state appeals court to reconsider a March ruling upholding her punishment. 
In March, a 3-judge panel for Texas' 2nd court of appeals unanimously upheld that sentence, writing that whether or not Mason knew she was ineligible to vote was irrelevant to whether she was guilty of a crime. 
In a June 1 filing, Mason's attorneys asked the full court to reconsider the ruling. They argued Mason technically did not vote because her provisional ballot was rejected and that any ambiguity in the law should be seen in her favor. They also noted the March ruling could be used as a basis to prosecute thousands of Texans in upcoming elections. 
Federal law requires election officials to offer anyone unsure of their voter eligibility a provisional ballot at the polls. Any voter who casts a ballot in good faith but turns out to be ineligible could be prosecuted under the court's reasoning, Mason's lawyers wrote. More than 11,000 provisional ballots have been rejected in Mason's county since 2014.
Mason's case has drawn national attention because of the severity of her sentence. Mason cast a provisional ballot in the 2016 presidential election while she was on supervised release, which is like probation, from a federal felony related to inflating tax returns (Texas does not allow people convicted of felonies to vote until they have entirely finished their sentences). 
She has always maintained she didn't know she couldn't vote and only cast a provisional ballot when poll workers offered her one after they couldn't find her on the rolls. Election officials never counted her provisional ballot, but in 2018 she was convicted of illegally voting anyway. 
The appeals court on Tuesday asked Texas to respond to Mason's request by June 26.

McCarthy has complained that Democratic leaders have blocked Republicans from negotiations over the House police reform bill, but the Democrats already have enough co-sponsors to pass the legislation.
At Senate Republicans' press conference today, Scott noted there were a number of overlaps between the Senate and House bills. However, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer has already said Scott's bill does not go far enough to address police misconduct.

Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer sharply criticized Republicans ' police reform bill, but he appeared to leave the door open to debating the measure next week.
 Democrats hold 47 seats in the Senate, which would be enough to block the motion to proceed on the legislation if they are unified in opposition to taking up the bill.
Senator Tim Scott said at Senate Republicans' press conference today, ""If we don't have the votes on a motion to proceed, that means that politics is more important than restoring confidence in communities of color in the institutions of authority.""

 ""We've only had the bill for a few hours and are reviewing it,"" Schumer said on the Senate floor. ""But what's clear is that the Senate Republican proposal on policing does not rise to the moment."" 
The New York Democrat said the bill's ""greatest flaw"" was that it is ""missing real, meaningful accountability for individual officers' misconduct."" ""This bill will need dramatic improvement,"" Schumer said. 
 Democrats have called for banning qualified immunity so that police officers can be held accountable for misconduct in civil court, but Republican senator Tim Scott described that proposal as a ""poison pill.""

Scott added moments later, ""If we don't have the votes on a motion to proceed, that means that politics is more important than restoring confidence in communities of color in the institutions of authority.""
A reporter noted Republicans have not been using the word ""systemic racism"" to describe the problem with policing, as many Democrats have. She asked if that would impede negotiations between the two parties.
Scott, the only black Republican in the senator, emphasized the two bills shared many similarities and added, ""We're not a racist county. We deal with racism because there's racism in the country.""

Axios have what they are describing as a scoop this morning - the news that a group of prominent Republican operatives are launching a super PAC to turn out Republican voters in November - for Joe Biden.
The report says that they will initially target voters in six battleground states: Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. They plan to emphasise Biden's record on ""free trade, states' rights, federal spending and respecting US diplomatic and military alliances - and highlight his Catholic faith - to make the case that most anti-Trump Republicans can feel comfortable supporting him.""
That might - of course - point out some of the reasons that the Bernie Sanders supporting left-wing of the Democrat party are a bit uncomfortable with Biden as their nominee.
One of the people involved is Anthony Scaramucci. He is quoted as saying he is ""very confident that we can convince a large group of Republican voters that Biden is the right person to vote for if they want to stay true to their principles and to the legacy of the Republican Party.""

Coronavirus and the Black Lives Matter protests make 2020's March primary campaigns seem like ancient history, but voting chaos is going to be a big theme for the November election. Politico this morning have a look at a report into why people had to queue for hours in California's Super Tuesday primary on 3 March. 
About 15 percent of Los Angeles County voters who responded to a county survey reported waiting more than two hours to vote, and 10 percent said they waited longer than three hours, according to people who responded to a county survey. 
The report that has been quietly slipped out by Los Angeles County pins the blame on ""malfunctions in the electronic tablets used to check in voters at the polls"".
 The delays were caused by some poll books taking hours to sync their voter lists with each other and with the countywide voter registration database, making them unusable during this time. The devices also had another problem: Poll workers were supposed to be able to look up voters' records by name and address but were limited to name searches, producing hundreds of false positives in some cases that poll workers had to sift through. 
There was also a failure rate of around 5% in the electronic voting machines. None of the findings in the report give much confidence for November's chances of a queue-free election.

Lisa Mascaro and Jim Mustain at Associated Press have seen a draft of the bill, and this morning are trailling what we can expect to see in it. They describe it as ""the most ambitious GOP policing proposal in years"", although the 106-page bill is not as sweeping as the counter Democrat proposal, which is set for a House vote next week.
The proposed Republican legislation would beef up requirements for law enforcement to compile use of force reports under a new George Floyd and Walter Scott Notification Act. It would also establish the Breonna Taylor Notification Act to track ""no-knock"" warrants.
To focus on ending chokeholds, it encourages agencies to do away with the practice or risk losing federal funds. It also provides funding for training to ""de-escalate"" situations and establish a ""duty to intervene"" protocol to prevent excessive force.
In efforts to gain Democrat support, it also includes a long-sought bill to make lynching a federal hate crime.

ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) mourns the loss of U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-GA, an iconic leader who played a pivotal role in the events of the Civil Rights Era, from the Freedom Rides, to Bloody Sunday, to the March on Washington, where he delivered one of the keynote addresses at the age of 23 as the youngest speaker to take the stage. Congressman Lewis repeatedly and bravely risked his life to promote the philosophy of political nonviolence to help to achieve the dream of equality.
""We are devastated to learn of the passing of my hero, friend and civil rights icon, Rep. John Lewis,"" said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. ""John devoted his life to the pursuit of justice and taught the world about the importance of making what he called 'good trouble.' Lewis was a fearless leader whose courage and heroism were on display each and every day as he fought for a more just world.""
""What he did not only for the African-American community, but for the entire country stands as an example of courage and of heroism. We were fortunate to have him in our ranks as a supporter and friend through the decades,"" said Esta Epstein, Chair of the ADL Board of Directors.
In addition to his leadership in the House, Rep. Lewis was a close friend of ADL and a lifelong supporter of ADL's mission to achieve justice and fair treatment to all. Rep. Lewis stood shoulder to shoulder with ADL leaders as they worked to advance federal hate crimes legislation in the House and Senate and toward the passage of hate crime laws in all 50 states. He was likewise a strong supporter of the Equality Act and the Voting Rights Advancement Act; and he worked with ADL in response to the white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, and proudly served as a member of the ADL Centennial Committee in 2013.
That same year, he was honored at ADL's In Concert Against Hate at the Kennedy Center for a lifetime of public service and his courage in advancing the ideals of the civil rights movement in America. He was presented with ADL's Lifetime Achievement Award by ADL's Southeast Region on March 16, and will be posthumously celebrated in an upcoming July 30 webinar.
Throughout his life, Rep. Lewis also spoke out strongly against antisemitism, and, most recently in the wake of horrific antisemitic attacks in Pittsburgh, Poway and Monsey, used his voice and his bully pulpit to speak out strongly against acts of hatred against Jews and other minorities.
""He not only is the moral compass for all we do - fighting the good fight - but as we look to fight hate every day, his tenacity, his ability to stick through things and to continuously show leadership, inspired us all,"" said Allison Padilla-Goodman, Vice President, ADL Southern Division. ""We will deeply miss his leadership and expresses our sincere condolences to his entire family.""

A waterfront city just 20 minutes north of Seattle ditched its initially preferred choice for police chief simply because he is white. Instead, the city hired a less qualified person, who happens to be non-white, to take on the position.
Normally, I would join you in dismissing the preceding sentences as shamefully bigoted commentary based upon flawed assumptions. But in this case, it's not just tendentious commentary.
Officials in Edmonds, Washington aren't even bothering to hide their motives; they're embracing condescending tokenism and framing their hiring decision on race, rather than qualifications. It reflects the odious nature of progressivism, wherein privileged white liberals declaring their ""anti-racism"" are the very ones conscientiously acting according to race.
Back in April, Edmonds Mayor Mike Nelson announced via press release that 25-year police veteran Jim Lawless would become chief. With a quarter-century of experience, Lawless holds a master's degree and is a graduate of the FBI National Academy. At the time, Nelson said of Lawless, ""I can't imagine a person better suited for this job.""
But then political winds changed—and so did the mayor's mind.
Earlier this December, the mayor announced he would now appoint Sherman Pruitt to the position. Pruitt is the current police chief of a small Indian reservation of just 400 people near the small town of Darrington, Washington.
""I was really disappointed and I have a lot of questions,"" retired Edmonds police chief Al Compaan told a local TV station. ""What changed, all of a sudden?""
What changed was a new commitment to ""anti-racism.""
After the death of George Floyd, the Edmonds community took to the streets to demand change. When some residents pushed back at the political positions of Black Lives Matter (BLM), Nelson and members of the all-white city council responded in kind.
Edmonds City Council President Adrienne Fraley-Monillas participated in a BLM protest imploring anyone who stood in opposition to the activist group's messages to better educate themselves. Nelson promised to continue ""the work to create an anti-racist climate here in Edmonds."" Even Lawless reacted, ludicrously pursuing the vandalism as a felony hate crime (the local prosecutor rejected the case).
Five months later, amid increasingly urgent statements signaling Nelson's support for BLM, it seems that the optics of hiring a white police chief was too much for Nelson and the council. Pruitt was confirmed in a four to three vote.
Supportive of the switch, Fraley-Monillas implied that it was Pruitt's race that made him qualified to hold the position.
""In this time frame in Edmonds, I think we could use Chief Pruitt,"" she told KING 5. ""With all the racism in Edmonds, we have somebody who has had that experience in their life. I think that's important.""
Nelson, who declined interviews on the topic, released a statement on Facebook defending his choice. You don't have to read between the lines for subtext.
Nelson cited ""social justice, and equity and accountability to the community"" as the impetus for the selection. He praised Pruitt's work on ""police accountability, transparency and recruiting of well-qualified, diverse candidates."" It read like it was crafted by the very BLM activists Nelson has been seeking to impress.
To be clear, Pruitt is qualified to be a police chief in a city the size of Edmonds. But on paper, any reasonable person would conclude that he is less qualified than Lawless.
Consider how local politicians framed this hire. They seem to be turning Pruitt into a human prop to signal their own virtue—that they're sending a message about their stance against racism by hiring a black police chief.
It's unfair to Pruitt to be treated like this. It's not just racist and demeaning. As someone who's personally been tokenized, I find the behavior outright insufferable.
I'm gay and Jewish. I can't begin to tell you how annoyed I get when people transparently seek my approval simply because it makes them feel progressive to have a gay friend. The same mindset extends to hiring decisions—that your value to them isn't your character or skillset, but the social currency you bring to their lives or political careers. (In fairness, outing myself as a conservative usually sends them running; they're only tolerant of minorities as long as you ideologically identify with them.)
On the national stage, the issue is playing out with Joe Biden. He's awkwardly celebrating the identities of his diverse Cabinet selections, rather than highlighting their unique skills. In California, this manifested itself in a law that affirmatively mandates corporate diversity.
More broadly, privileged white liberals often exploit social justice movements as a means to declare themselves heroes for being ""enlightened."" Some of it is borne out of guilt, but much of it is based in narcissism.
These progressives involve themselves in such social justice causes to boast about their ""enlightenment"" on social media—not to actually help communities they claim to support. You may not ask, but they'll nonetheless tell you all the things they've done to fight bigotry, like buy White Fragility for their racist uncle or exclusively order takeout from black-owned restaurants on UberEats.
Yet, the very same folks were silent when Jews were systematically beaten up in New York. And of course, they say nothing around the treatment of the Uyghur Muslim minority in Xinjiang, China. Progressives don't consider Jews minorities and Uyghur is too hard to pronounce, so I guess they're not worth defending.
If there's not a national movement to attach themselves to, and a group they're looking to befriend for gain, white progressives stay silent. I wish they'd stay silent.
Phony allyship means these progressives partner with fringe activists and use that partnership as cover to pursue far-left legislation like defunding the police. In Edmonds, it means pushing out a more qualified candidate for a job.

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court of the United States on Tuesday allowed the first federal executions in 17 years to proceed, overturning a lower court order delaying them.Four federal executions were scheduled but a district court judge had suspended them to allow for legal challenges to the lethal injection that was to be used.The district court decision had come just hours before the first execution, of former white supremacist Daniel Lewis Lee, who was convicted with another man of murdering a family of three during a robbery intended to help fund the founding of an 'Aryan Peoples Republic'.The prisoners 'have not made the showing required to justify last-minute intervention by a Federal Court', the Supreme Court said in a ruling released in the early hours of Tuesday.'We vacate the District Court's preliminary injunction so that the... executions may proceed as planned.'In staying the executions, District Judge Tanya Chutkan had ruled that the use of a single drug, pentobarbital, to carry out the executions could cause 'extreme pain and needless suffering' and may violate a constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment.An appeals court had upheld that order before the Supreme Court vacated it.Lee would be the first federal inmate to be executed in the United States since 2003 and the first since President Donald Trump announced plans to resume federal executions.There have been just three federal executions since the death penalty was reinstated in 1988.Lee and another man, Chevie Kehoe, were convicted in Arkansas in 1999 of the 1996 murders of gun dealer William Mueller, his wife, and her eight-year-old daughter.According to prosecutors, the pair robbed Mueller to steal guns that they planned to sell to finance the founding of a white supremacist 'Aryan Peoples Republic' in the Pacific Northwest.Lee, who has since renounced his white supremacist beliefs according to his lawyers, was sentenced to death while Kehoe received three life sentences without the possibility of parole. 'Untenable position' Earlene Peterson, 81, whose daughter and granddaughter were killed, has campaigned against Lee's death sentence, saying she wants him to spend the rest of his life behind bars.'It's an easy way out,' Peterson told The New York Times. 
'He should have to live through this. Like I did.'Peterson and relatives of other victims also filed a lawsuit seeking to delay the execution, arguing that it was dangerous for them to travel to Terre Haute to witness Lee's execution because of the coronavirus pandemic. An appeals court dismissed the suit on Sunday, but Baker Kurrus, a lawyer for the families, said he would take it to the Supreme Court.'The federal government has put this family in the untenable position of choosing between their right to witness Danny Lee's execution and their own health and safety,' Kurrus said.The Supreme Court, however, denied their application.The Bureau of Prisons said on Sunday that a member of the Terre Haute prison staff had tested positive for COVID-19.'There's no reason for anybody to be carrying out executions right now because of the pandemic,' said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Centre.More than 1,000 US religious leaders urged Trump last week to abandon plans to resume federal executions and Dunham accused the president of 'political use of the death penalty'.Trump, who faces a tough reelection battle in November, has called for stepped-up use of capital punishment, especially for killers of police officers and drug traffickers.Only a handful of US states, mainly in the conservative South, still actively carry out executions. In 2019, 22 people were put to death.Most crimes are tried under state laws, but federal courts handle some of the most serious crimes, including terror attacks and hate crimes.MENAFN1607202000280000ID1100495467"

Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Wednesday, June 24. Your tops stories right now. 8 a.m. on the button on the east coast. Coronavirus cases spiking. Half of the United States now reporting a rise in cases. Arizona, Texas, California all hitting new daily records. Texas Governor, Greg Abbott, is telling people to stay home. Dr. Anthony Fauci, meanwhile, sounding the alarm but also giving people some hope for a vaccine.

ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: We're now seeing a disturbing surge of infections. There is a reasonably good chance that by the very beginning of 2021 that if we're going to have a vaccine that we will have it by then.
(END VIDEOCLIP)
BARTIROMO: As virus cases rise, so do the calls for more stimulus meanwhile. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says Congress could pass a new package in July. The pandemic also hitting markets. Futures indicating a triple-digit decline this morning as a result of all of this new case spike. The Dow Industrials down 239 points. The Nasdaq down 38, and the S&P 500 down 23. This after markets ended yesterday in the green. In fact, the Nasdaq shattering another record close. It closed at a new all-time-high for a second day in a row. The Nasdaq now at 10,131 with a gain of 75 points. The Dow was up 131 yesterday.
Police reform in focus. Protestors are going on, but Senate Republicans are voting today to move forward on changes. They are still facing pushback from Democrats on police reform.

Also, the U.S. reportedly looking to impose new tariffs on goods from the E.U., places like Spain, Germany, the U.K. on $3.1 billion of imports. Meanwhile, the European Union is also easing up on coronavirus restrictions and opening its boarders, but it may ban American travelers. The FT100 down 130 points, the CAC quarante down 85, the DAX Index in Germany down 217.
In Asia overnight, markets were mixed. Tensions between North and South Korea seem to be easing. North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, suspended military action against South Korea. The KOSPI Index was up 1.5 percent.
Joining me this morning is Dagen McDowell, Cabot Phillips, and Ryan Payne.
DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST: Good morning.
CABOT PHILLIPS, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Morning.
RYAN PAYNE, PAYNE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT PRESIDENT: Morning.
BARTIROMO: Morning to everybody. Great to see you. Some of the top stories that we are watching this morning right now, a grim milestone for the COVID-19 pandemic with the number of confirmed cases worldwide now surpassing nine million. The number of new cases in the United States is on the rise. Arizona, California, Texas all reporting new daily records yesterday. Seven states seeing a spike in hospitalizations as well.
Dr. Anthony Fauci telling Congress yesterday that the states with growing coronavirus cases may not need to shut down like before like they did back in March. Dr. Fauci also said that the White House Task Force was never told to slow down COVID-19 testing and that a vaccine could be ready by the end of 2020 or early next year.
All right, more unrest in our national's capital as protestors burn an American flag near Lafayette Park. It comes just one day after a group tried to form the so-called Black House Autonomous Zone right outside the White House and attempted to tear down a statute of Andrew Jackson in Washington. President Trump issued a warning, tweeting this. ""There will never be an autonomous zone in Washington, D.C. as long as I am your president. If they try, they will be met with serious force."" Twitter later said that the tweet violated its rules but it left it up anyway. President Trump is not backing down while in Arizona yesterday.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The left-wing mob is trying to demolish our heritage so they can replace it with a new repressive regime that they alone control. And if you give power to people that demolish monuments and attack churches and seize city streets and set fire to buildings, then nothing is sacred and no one is safe.

BARTIROMO: The president bowing to sign an executive order to protect our nation's historical monuments. He's threatening vandals with up to 10 years in prison. Meanwhile, friends and family paying final respects to 27-year- old Rayshard Brooks yesterday. The funeral held in Atlanta at the church where the reverend Martin Luther King Jr. was a co-pastor. This as police arrest 29-year-old Natalie White for allegedly burning down a Wendy's restaurant where Brooks was shot after a struggle with police. White is believed to have been Brooks's girlfriend.
A Louisville detective officially fired in the shooting death of Breonna Taylor. The department says Brett Hankison violated its policy on deadly force by firing 10 rounds into a covered window and door that prevented him from verifying an immediate threat. Hankison has 10 days to appeal his termination. Taylor was shot and killed by officers inside of her home earlier this year during a raid on a no-knock warrant. Those warrants have since been banned in Louisville.
And Nascar driver, Bubba Wallace, says the rope found inside of his garage is a noose. After the FBI determined that no hate crime was committed because the rope was a garage door pull that was left there last year.

BUBBA WALLACE, NASCAR DRIVER: It's a straight up noose. The FBI has stated it was a noose. I can confirm that. I actually got evidence of what was hanging in my garage over my car.

BARTIROMO: The FBI says although the rope was tied like a noose, video shows it was hanging in the garage last October. The results of the FBI investigation come one day after Nascar drivers and their crews marched with Wallace in a show of solidarity.
America's favorite past time expected to return next month. Opening day for Major League Baseball set for July 24 with players due to report to training camps next week. There will be a 60-game season with the playoffs in the World Series taking place in October. Lead officials of the Players' Union are still working on health and safety protocols which reportedly include temperature checks and COVID-19 tests every other day.
Well, the nationwide unrest is escalating. Protesters burning an American flag yesterday in Washington, D.C. just one day after President Trump threatened force against any protesters attempting to establish an autonomous zone in the nation's capital.
In Atlanta, armed protesters near the Wendy's where Rayshard Brooks was killed, are setting up roadblocks to keep cops away.
It comes as the Senate gears up to vote today on sweeping police reform legislation. But the vote is in jeopardy as Congress clashes over how to address nationwide demand for change.
Joining me right now is the U.S. Housing and Urban Development secretary, Ben Carson. Dr. Carson, it's great to see you. Secretary, thank you so much for joining me this morning.
BEN CARSON, SECRETARY, U.S. HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT: Thank you. Always good to be with you, Maria.
BARTIROMO: So, incredible moment in time. As I said to the A.G. the other day, we've got massive protests everywhere, these autonomous zones being protected with men and women with guns in our own cities.
What are you going to do as an official -- government official -- in terms of bringing law and order back?
CARSON: Well, it's obviously very important that we do have law and order and that people feel safe.
You know, one of the reasons that people pay their taxes is so that they will have protection of their personal well-being, their homes, their businesses. And when the government officials fail to do that, they are breaking a contract with the people, and you allow this kind of anarchy to continue. That's not who we are.
And a lot of it has to do with people always putting their finger up in the air and seeing which way the wind is blowing rather than doing what is right. And if we continue to allow anarchy, it will only spread.
So, whether you're a Democrat or Republican official, mayor, governor, you have an obligation to the people who elected you -- remember that. You have no obligation to a party or to an ideology.
BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, there are people that are living in CHOP, the Capitol Hill Organized (sic) Protest area, that they don't want all of this around their homes. So people's rights are being impacted and their property is being destroyed --
CARSON: Absolutely.
BARTIROMO: -- so something's got to be done.
I know the A.G. said this can't -- this can't go on indefinitely, but what is the answer, Secretary? Is it suing the mayor? Is it challenging the city? I mean, what can you do?
CARSON: Well, you may be a little surprised at my answer but the answer lies in each one of us. Those of us who actually love this country, love the freedoms that we have, want to pass this on to our children, are going to have to stop being quiet. We have to stop getting in the corner and hoping that nobody notices us so that they won't call us a name.
And, you know --
BARTIROMO: Yes.
CARSON: -- the reason that this is the land of the free is because it's the home of the brave. You've got to be brave. You've got to stand up for what you believe in -- otherwise, it will be taken away from you.
BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, certainly, it's a very dangerous moment in time right now.
Secretary, nearly 46 million Americans now out of work as a result of the coronavirus shutdowns beginning back in March.
Do you predict this pandemic will worsen the affordable housing crisis? Where are we on the housing crisis, which you've been trying to combat for so long? Where is the availability of housing for those who need it?
CARSON: Well, interestingly enough, this may be an opportunity -- interesting -- because we have received through the Cares Act a significant amount of resources to be able to combat homelessness, and to make people understand the importance of removing some of the barriers that keep us from building affordable housing, and from using a lot of the technology.
You know, we're a very innovative society and very entrepreneurial, but when we put all kinds of barriers in the way that keep us from using that it's not helping us very much.
And, you know, we're making progress and working with a lot of the various jurisdictions. I was in Florida earlier this week and the Tamarind neighborhood in West Palm Beach -- a beautiful place now for low-income people who are in subsidized housing, but you wouldn't know that from looking at it. The crime rate has gone down enormously.
These are the kinds of things that we can do and we can spread around, and it can be done in a way that it doesn't interfere with the character and the nature of various neighborhoods around the country.
BARTIROMO: Well, what about all of this commercial real estate? You know, we're seeing a lot of pushback from people who feel like they don't want to go back into dense areas. They don't want to go back into cities. And then in cities, you've got 60, 70, 80-floor buildings that people have to wait in line to go get into the building for security.
Is there an opportunity for commercial real estate to reposition or retrofit to address the need that you're referring to?
CARSON: Well, one of the interesting things that we've learned through this crisis is that teleworking is very effective. I don't think it will ever go back to the way it was before.
And there are a lot of people who are going to be able to work from home. That's going to free up a lot of commercial space, which can be converted to affordable housing to take some of the pressure off. And we are very much looking at that right now and looking at ways to be able to facilitate that transformation.
BARTIROMO: So are you saying commercial real estate buildings could be turned into affordable housing?
CARSON: Yes, significant portions of them.
You know, there are whole floors of buildings now that are not going to be used because people are working from home, so no point in just letting that sit there. And it doesn't necessarily have to be used as commercial space.
Also, a lot of the developments that are going up now, particularly in opportunity zones, are mixed-used developments where you have mixed-income and you also have, usually on the lower floors, business opportunities. That provides jobs --
BARTIROMO: Really fascinating.
CARSON: Yes. I mean, these -- there's --
BARTIROMO: Yes, I --
CARSON: -- a lot of opportunity here.
BARTIROMO: This is such creative ideas from you, Secretary.
So, are you talking about cities, like New York? What are the cities that have the available commercial real estate that you could actually see transitioning to affordable housing?
CARSON: Virtually all of the -- virtually all of the major cities have significant spaces that can be used. And we're encouraging people in their planning now. I mean -- and this goes back --
BARTIROMO: Yes.
CARSON: -- to the city officials and it goes back to the various councils to begin to take this into consideration.
We will work with you. The federal government will work with you to make these transitions occur. We don't have to have these problems, particularly if we're willing to work together.
BARTIROMO: Yes, a really great idea.
Secretary, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks very much. We'll be watching your development.
CARSON: OK -- you, too. Thank you, Maria.
BARTIROMO: Sec. Ben Carson joining us there.
We've got a lot to talk about this morning. Next up, former Reagan Economic Advisor, Art Laffer, on the economic recovery from a Los Angles mayor, Antonio Villaraigosa, on the pushback in California over the state's mandated face order mask - the mask order. Don't miss that. Quick break. We'll be right back.
Welcome back. More European tariffs. The U.S. trade representative issuing a notice overnight considering new duties on $3.1 billion worth of exports from the E.U. and the U.K. They would include new tariffs on products like olives, alcohol, trucks, increasing on aircraft, yogurt, and cheese. Joining right now is Laffer Associates Chairman and former Economic Advisor to President Reagan, Art Laffer. Art, it is great to see you this morning. Thank you so much for being here. I know you're not a fan -
(CROSSTALK)
ART LAFFER, LAFFER ASSOCIATES CHAIRMAN: Thank you, Maria.
BARTIROMO: -- of tariffs. Is this news -
(CROSSTALK)
LAFFER: No, I'm not.
BARTIROMO: -- troubling to you?
LAFFER: Well, yes. But I want to make sure. I mean, they have been very good, by the way. All of the stuff about Trump being a protectionist and all that, the deal with China, the deal with Japan, the deal with Canada and Mexico all belie the fact that Trump really has done some pretty good deals, and I don't know what the logic is behind all of these specific tariffs. I don't like the one on beer. I really don't like that one, Maria. Just joking.
(LAUGHTER)
But, you know, trade with these countries is really important for us and for them, and it really solidifies the relationship. Countries that trade together, work together, they have peace together. So trade is really important, and I just hope they consider that very seriously in making any of these decisions.
BARTIROMO: So Art, let me ask you about getting us out of this. We are talking about a severe contraction in the second quarter, probably up to 30 percent. We are in a recession we believe -
(CROSSTALK)
LAFFER: Yes.
BARTIROMO: -- right now, and there's wide expectation that we will see growth in the third quarter, growth in the fourth quarter, and growth in 2021. Do you believe the administration will go back to the original playbook that you are among the architects of? That's the tax legislation, the deregulation. Are these the tools that the president needs to pull to get us out of this now a second time around?
LAFFER: Yes. Let me just say the second quarter, you're completely correct, Maria, but almost all of that decline in the second quarter occurred in the first month, month and a half bit, and it's been rebounding very sharply. You saw retail sales. You saw unemployment. You saw the stock market come back. So there's already a recovery well in hand. I would hope that the president would go to deregulation, and would hope very, very much if he wants more employment, wants more jobs, get rid of the payroll tax on through December 31 or wavier the payroll tax will really have an enormous incentive effective on bringing people right back to the workforce, to labor, to employment, to jobs as opposed to welfare and this $600 per week thing that's ridiculous. Paying people not to work is not the way to get into recovery. Believe me when I tell you that. So I - that's where I hope they are.
BARTIROMO: Yes. No, I -
(CROSSTALK)
LAFFER: And tamp it down. They're - we don't - yes, sorry.
BARTIROMO: No, no. Go ahead.
LAFFER: Oh, well you know, I don't think we should pay off states that have been doing bad jobs of running their fiscal policy. You know, I don't think we need another $2 trillion. If we did a $750 billion, $1 trillion with a payroll tax waiver, that should be enough to really rocket us back. Just bang! Get us going, and that's what I'd love to see, but we'll see how that works out. There are a lot of competing forces of people, some of them who don't understand economics very well and could well get us into trouble.
(LAUGHTER)
BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, we're all talking about -
(CROSSTALK)
LAFFER: It's not good (ph).
BARTIROMO: -- another stimulus plan, which we're going to get into in a second, but let me get in Ryan Payne right here. Go ahead, Ryan.
PAYNE: Yes, Art. I mean, I love what you're saying here, and it's - the thing that amazes me right now is most economist have just totally gotten this wrong, right? I mean, if you look at those retails sales last week where you just mentioned, that jobs report from May was just off the chart.
LAFFER: Right.
PAYNE: My firm was one of the only firms saying we're going for a V-shaped recovery because it just seems like most of these economists make fortune tellers look good. You know, what else do we have to - what else do we have to see here so that Congress maybe -

-- pulls back a little bit on the actual stimulus that they've put into the economy because it seems to me like, man, things are going to start rocking here especially as we're reopening all these different states.
LAFFER: Well, they are right now. I mean, really the deaths - I mean, all these people talk about resurgence of all this coronavirus stuff. You know, if you look at seven day rolling average deaths, it's way, way down. In April, there was a 2,300 I think it was per day, and now it's below 600. And it's just a straight line down. And deaths are the real problem. I mean, they really are the problem. It's not someone getting sick and being well again, being able to be fine. Deaths are the issue, and they're coming way down. All of these things are working well, but Ryan, what you've got to face is the real problem in Congress. These people are spending other people's money, and there's nothing more fun than -
(CROSSTALK)
BARTIROMO: Yes, good point.
LAFFER: -- spending someone else's money. I mean, if you're at a French restaurant with a high-priced champagne and caviar and -
(CROSSTALK)
BARTIROMO: Yes. Right.
LAFFER: -- (inaudible). I mean -
(CROSSTALK)
BARTIROMO: Yes, yes.
LAFFER: -- why not? Someone else paying for it. Let's go for it.
BARTIROMO: Art, you're great. You're great. Art Laffer, good to see you, sir. We will see you soon. We'll be right back.
Welcome back. Well, a potential E.U. travel ban as coronavirus cases are spiking once again in the United States amid reopenings. The European Union reportedly considers banning travelers from the United States by July 1 according to The New York Times. This ban would also apply to residents of Brazil and Russia. The Trump administration had been criticized by E.U. leaders for banning European travel into the United States back in March remember. Dagen, what do you think about this? Now they're going to come back and ban the U.S.
MCDOWELL: Okie dokie. Fine. I don't think anybody in the United States really wants to go to Europe during the summer given the fact that people are still contracting this virus. But don't come here because you know what? New York is reopening. I don't think we need a bunch of tourists. One of the reasons that New York was swamped with cases was because of people once the infection started spreading in Italy, where did those rich Italians go? Bingo. New York City. So again -
(CROSSTALK)
BARTIROMO: Yes.
MCDOWELL: -- we won't come there. You don't come here. We're good. Wait till next year.
BARTIROMO: Well you know what? I think this is - this is a dangerous move I think because so much revenue is coming from tourism in Europe during the summer. And yes, the coronavirus makes it that much more difficult, but they're going to shut off huge amounts of business if this is the case at a time when Europe is also in recession in some areas a lot worse than others.
MCDOWELL: And it goes both ways.
BARTIROMO: So there's an economic situation here.
MCDOWELL: Yes. There's a huge amount of tourism revenue that comes into New York City. Ultimately we need tourists there and we need tourists here, but look at the New York City Ballet. They've cancelled the entire fall season. There will be no Nutcracker come holiday time, come Christmas time, so why would anybody want to come here. There - you know, there's rising gun violence, rising murder rate, the mayor is a complete and utter disaster loser lurch. And so, why would anybody want to come here? I don't know. You can't go to a Broadway show. Broadway might not come back frankly until next year, too. So what are you going to do? You can't walk on the high line.
BARTIROMO: Well, the beaches - the beaches are beautiful and you can do that. And more beaches are opening this July 4, next weekend. Big, long weekend, but I get your point. I get your point.
(LAUGHTER)
MCDOWELL: I don't know. The beaches - the beaches on the - in the Hamptons are beautiful. The Jersey shore is beautiful, but I don't know. Some of the New York City beaches, I don't know about that.
BARTIROMO: And they've been shut down, that's for sure. All right, quick break and then California faces a mask rule pushback. Former Los Angeles Mayor, Antonio Villaraigosa is here on the controversy over the new regulation. Back in a minute with that.
BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, June 24, look at markets now, 8:31 A.M. on the East Coast.
We are looking at sell-off at the start of trading this morning, coronavirus spikes and putting pressure on Futures, even though we had a good day yesterday, the Dow Industrials off with the lows of the morning, down 201 points right now, the NASDAQ down 22 and the S&P down 18.5.
Yesterday, the NASDAQ closed at all-time high. We had money moving into stocks in a big way triple digit again 4:00 on Wall Street yesterday with the Dow Industrial.
Global action, though, is lower. European indices are right across the board investors are watching the spike from coronavirus cases, and selling. And meanwhile, there is also issue, the US reported and looking to impose new tariffs on goods from Spain, France, Germany and UK on goods of $3.1 billion tariffs on that money, and those imports coming in. That is what is weighing on European indices this morning.
Asian markets are mixed overnight. We did see gains in Korea. But for the most part, it was fractional moves pretty much across the board.
JCPenney set to close 13 more stores this summer as it works towards restructuring in bankruptcy court. Cheryl Casone with the details there now, Cheryl?
CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Maria. The department store cases going out of business. Sales of those stores could begin as early next Friday. Just last week, JCPenney announced plans to close 136 stores across the nation, part of a broader plan to permanently close more than 240 locations.
JCPenney fell for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection back in may after years of declining sales and two months of lockdowns due to the coronavirus pandemic. Company has until mid-July to deliver a turnaround plan to shareholders.
Well, a massive warehouse, the biggest ever in New York City reportedly is going to be leased out by Amazon. Quite a business insider of the company has signed on for one million square foot space out in Queens. Amazon will demolish the former paper making factory and build a multi-story delivery station to help consumers get orders even faster.
Amazon famously been in plans to build a second headquarters in New York City last year, but they didn't do it, thanks to heavy local opposition especially from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Take a look at the stock of the free market, up more than 0.5 percent.
And here is a look what is trending this morning on foxbusiness.com. Richard Branson's adult only cruise line Virgin Voyages will make a soft- debut in October with the health plan restrictions to keep those travelers safe in the wake of the coronavirus.
Justice Department officials and some states attorney's general will meet Friday to discuss the antitrust probes into alphabet's Google, federal probe focuses on search bias, advertising and management of Google's android operating systems.
And finally, the Ford Ranger takes top spot on cars.com's 2020 American made index. And those are your headlines, Maria.
BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you. Meanwhile, California's mask controversy now, Governor Gavin Newsom is urging residents to wear masks in public places as coronavirus cases spike in the states. But some local officials and police departments are push back refusing to enforce the rule.
Joining me right now is former Los Angeles Mayor and Mercury Co-Chairman Antonio Villaraigosa. And, sir, it is good to see you again, thanks so much for joining me this morning.
ANTONIO VILLARAIGOSA, FORMER MAYOR, LOS ANGELES: Good morning, Maria, how are you?
BARTIROMO: What is your reaction to this pushback on wearing masks in L.A.?
VILLARAIGOSA: Well, we've seen that all over the country as I told you before the last few times I've been on your show. I was in Mexico, and I haven't seen anywhere in the world where people are pushing back to wear masks in the way you see here in the United States, frankly.
And we've seen an uptick in coronavirus all cross the country, particularly in places where people are pushing back to wear a mask. And so, the governor was almost forced to do what he did because so many people are pushing back, as you said.
BARTIROMO: Yes. Cabot?
PHILLIPS: Mr. Mayor, Cabot Phillips here. What do you think that states like California should do as they start to reopen obviously, a spike in cases as people are getting out and about more. Do you think where we see coronavirus cases spiking that there should be a retraction on some of the reopening processes, or do you think that it's important to just keep pushing through with reopening because you might end up never getting a reopening if you stop at every time there's a spike?
VILLARAIGOSA: I think we need to be led by the science, guided by science, but not hide behind it. Ultimately we have to make decisions and we have to balance.
Clarity, here in California we're beginning to open up. We're seeing, a spike of sorts but not the kind that would require that we close it down. By virtue of your question, it's clear to me anyway, that we're going to have to balance. There's no question that this economy has to open up. There is no question that people are pushing back in part because they feel that, you know, they need to get back to work, not feel, they have to get back to work.
But at the same time, we're going to have to look at it public assets. It's a balance always.
BARTIROMO: Yes.
VILLARAIGOSA: We're not going to, you know, put an edict that is not required but at the same time we do have to look at the public health.
BARTIROMO: Antonio, the 2020 race heating up. President Trump spoke out yesterday in Arizona on his opponent Joe Biden. I want your reduction to what the President said listen to this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We will work it out with DACA. I think good things are happening with DACA. They resubmit but we'll work it out. And the Democrats had been playing with DACA for years, and they haven't done anything, I'll get it done. I'll get it done, and -- good things will happen for DACA recipients.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BARTIROMO: What is your take on the President's moves on DACA? He is going to try again. Meanwhile, former President Obama joining his former Vice President Joe Biden for a virtual fund-raiser yesterday, here is that.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: We will work it out with DACA. I think good things are happening with DACA. They resubmit but we'll work it out. And the Democrats had been playing with DACA for years, and they haven't done anything, I'll get it done. I'll get it done, and -- good things will happen for DACA recipients.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BARTIROMO: Antonio, obviously that was same sound bite. Yes, go ahead.
VILLARAIGOSA: He always clearly lives in alternative universe, more than 70 percent of the nation believes that these kids who came through no choice of their own with their parents who have lived here, no other country, ought to be able to have a, well, to be here, to live here, to work here.
Thirty thousand of them are on the frontlines, first responders. Many of them have graduated from college, gone on to great careers. When he says, we're going to do good things with them, I think the only thing he has done up to now is try to end the program. He said they are going to the redo paperwork. They're going to try to continue to end the program.
So what good things he is talking about, I don't know. I do know this, the vast majority of these young people deserve to be able to continue to work and live here, build their families here. It's the only country they know. And as I said, some 70 percent of America agrees.
With respect to Biden, the camp, you know, it's -- look ...
BARTIROMO: Yes.
VILLARAIGOSA: You know, you and I talked about this before, the country is evenly divided. We need the peace makers. We need people that want to bring us together. I'm a Democrat but I want to work with Republicans. I think we need to work together to put the country forward. And I'm hoping Joe Biden will do that. I know that President Trump hasn't.
And I don't say that because he is a Republican. I've had a, you know, a great deal of respect for Republican leaders both here in California and across the nation. But I just don't see the president as someone who wants to bring us together and unite us, particularly in these troubling times of pandemic of, you know, all of the, you know, the world issues and problems that we're facing.
BARTIROMO: The campaign for Joe Biden raised some $7.6 million apparently in fund-raising. I want to ask you, yours -- the state of play right now, Joe Biden versus Donald Trump. What do you think Americans are going to be voting on come November? I mean, we've got an economy clearly that is struggling due to the shutdown and the COVID-19 pandemic, but going into this, we had one of the best economies that we've seen in a long time in terms of job creation. Do you think this comes back by year end or by the election?
VILLARAIGOSA: Well, look. I don't want to play politics. I do hope the economy comes back. I think every Democrat and every Republican, every American hope the economy comes back because too many people are suffering, too many people out of work. So I hope it comes back.
I'm not sure it will, it certainly in the way that it did before the pandemic. I think, it's going to take a while. I'm not an expert in that regard but everything I read and hear, is that it is going to take a while.
BARTIROMO: Yes.
VILLARAIGOSA: I think people are going to vote.
BARTIROMO: Well, I mean -- yes.
VILLARAIGOSA: I'm sorry?
BARTIROMO: No, they are going to vote how?
VILLARAIGOSA: I think they are going to vote on the economy frankly, that will be part of why they vote -- what they vote on. I think they are also going to vote on do we need to continue this hearing and the screamers. You know, do we need somebody that can bring us together and unite us around the common mission of taking America forward, you know, of --
BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, this growing unrest, this growing unrest is only adding to the issues. You've got growing unrest in the so-called autonomous zones like Seattle. They are trying to build one in Washington. Do you worry that Los Angeles is going to see something similar crop up where protesters start, you know, boarding off an area and say this is our city and we're going to guard it with guns, and burn flags.
VILLARAIGOSA: Well, you know, our constitution protects the right to protest, and I certainly respect peaceful protests. And understand why people have protested, both George Floyd murder. But also, the racial oppression that continues to exist in this country.
However, what's going on in Seattle is not something that I can support. I think the vast majority of Americans could support. We can't that kind of lawlessness. I know there was murder there or killing there the other day. I know that in addition to that, you know, there are, you know, police officers can't come in, the neighborhood wants to make sure that they are safe.
And so, I don't expect that that will happen here in Los Angeles. But, as you said, it has happened in Seattle.
BARTIROMO: Yes, all right. Antonio, great to see you this morning as always. Mayor Villaraigosa, we will see you soon. Thanks for joining me this morning. Thank you, sir.
VILLARAIGOSA: Well, great to see you. I was hoping (inaudible).
BARTIROMO: And to you. Saks is reopening. The legendary retailer putting lockdown and riots in the rear view mirror. That's next. And then, don't forget to ask Maria, the tables are turning and I will be answering your questions through social media. You can submit them through our Instagram and our Twitter, do that. Back in a minute.
BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Fox Business alert right now, Tesla shares are under pressure right now, take a look. Down 1.25 percent after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says it has opened up a probe into 63,000 Model S Tesla vehicles. This after reports of touchscreen failures. We'll keep following this. Stock is reacting this morning more on that.
Meanwhile, New York businesses coming back. Opening up once again, the boards and the barbed wire surrounding Saks Fifth Avenue, its flagship store, have now been removed.
As it prepares to welcome shoppers back today, Lauren Simonetti is live on Fifth Avenue this morning for the store's grand reopening. Lauren, good morning to you.
LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT: A quiet 5th Avenue, Maria. Remember that barbed wire fencing that put up not long ago to protect this iconic flagship Saks on this historic 5th Avenue luxury shopping to protect the store and everything inside of it. It's gone. Let me show you what replaced it.
These windows, they are black. They are understated and I think that's the point, but they say, ""Welcome back. We missed you."" Saks will open its stores for the first time since March 17th, later this morning at 11:00 Eastern Time, Maria.
There will be 1,000 workers in the store greeting customers. We hope that they show up, giving them masks when needed, and there will be changes when you go inside. And that show you picture of the escalators. You're going to see these bright purple and green lights emanating because they're reflecting the UV light that is disinfecting the escalator rails.
There's going to be separate sections with plexiglass where you go to return an item. That item will be cleaned and quarantined for 24 hours. Ten hand washing stations per floor.
What will be missing at Saks, when it does open its doors today, are discounts, imagine that? No big sales. Why? Here is why. Saks says they have new summer merchandise. They have been doing Zoom shopping. They have been doing delivery to the Hamptons.
And even before pandemic, when they were struggling, what was booming for them was their concierge service, their personal shopping. That grew 15 percent. And Saks hopes that that continues, that's why they're going to open their doors two hours early, and close doors their two hours late every day for personal shopping, Maria. So that's where they think the money is going to be at for now.
Also, what's missing when Saks reopens is the tourists. Where are tourists in New York City? That's a third of sales roughly. The spa inside will also be closed for now.
But here's the thing. As you look up and down Fifth Avenue, which is like a luxury shopping Mecca, many of these brands are saying, you know what, we don't want to be here anymore. They'll move locations and Saks thinks if that continues to happen, that's good for them, Maria. Back to you.
BARTIROMO: Yes, really interesting. It's nice to see Saks reopening by the way. Great stuff, Lauren, thank you. Lauren Simonetti on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan in this morning. Coming up, mullets making a comeback, you heard it right, the reason why when we come back. Stay with us.
BARTIROMO: Welcome back. So a bit of a blast from the past. The infamous mullet haircut makes comeback. It is the hairstyle America loves to hate. Pop star Miley Cyrus, supporting the look earlier this year after her dad, Billy Ray Cyrus, rocked it back in the day. Dagen, did you ever have this haircut?
MCDOWELL: No, I never even had a perm in the '80s. So I avoided that. Thank the Lord. Miley Cyrus' haircut is the Carol Brady haircut from '70s. It's sort of a mullet not really. By the way, where I come from you call it a ""sho-lo,"" short in the front and long in the back. Business in the front, party in the back.
I want to give Chuck Rocha -- Chuck Rocha has appeared on Fox frequently. He worked on Bernie Sanders' campaign. Chuck tweets photos of the mullet that he had in Texas. I'm guessing it was in the '80s and it was epic. It was better than Billy Ray Cyrus' mullet because the back of it had a home perm it in. And so it's really, really curly, curly, curly in the back and super short in front with baseball cap over it, and it is awesome.
So to Chuck Rocha, the best mullet and I've seen a lot of them I've ever laid eyes on.
BARTIROMO: What do you think Ryan? And, Cabot, you can pull that off, right?
PAYNE: I mean, the perm plus the mullet, that's pretty ambitious. But my curiosity is, Maria and Dagen, did your high prom dates have mullets? And if they did, we'd love to see that picture.
MCDOWELL: I didn't go to my prom, my date stood me up. I fell down a flight of stairs, and broke my tailbone.
BARTIROMO: Oh no.
MCDOWELL: So that's my prom story.
BARTIROMO: Oh my goodness.
PAYNE: Now, I'm sad, Dagen.
BARTIROMO: Well, I did go to the prom and he didn't have a mullet haircut though.
PAYNE: I'm disappointed, (inaudible) better.
BARTIROMO: I'll find the picture for you. Stay with us, more ""Mornings with Maria"" right after this.
BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Take a look at Futures, as we are about 35 minutes away from the opening bell. We're expecting a decline at the start of trading, down 153 points on the Dow, the NASDAQ down 13, S&P down 13.
Remember, this is the final week of the quarter. We're talking about some of the best numbers in terms of a quarter since 1995, in terms of the S&P, in a decade for the NASDAQ. Ryan, Cabot, you've seen this market trade well. Your final thoughts, Cabot?
PHILLIPS: Yes. Well, I think that as optimism continues to grow, I think there's a lot more pent-up demand and the market might even be working in right now. And also, I think that in all the unrest that we've seen in the past few weeks, it's actually could have been -- the one silver lining here could have actually been drawing people's attention away from COVID, kind of helping them move on.
Once all the protest started, I think now people are starting to look toward opening things up this summer. I think that was playing a big role in them starting to move on and increase their confidence in getting out there into the economy. So that could be a silver lining from all the unrest we've seen.
PAYNE: Yes, Cabot, I actually agree with you on that.
BARTIROMO: This quarter is going to be the best quarter since 1975 on the S&P, Ryan?
PAYNE: Yes, absolutely. And --"

The city's medical examiner said on Tuesday that Alexander's cause of death was ruled to be a ""suicide by hanging.""An NYPD spokesperson told Gothamist on Wednesday that the investigation into Alexander's death ""continues.""'We are just trying to grieve,' Alexander's brother, Keats Alexander, told the Daily News[1] yesterday. 'He was definitely loved by his family and his community. 
It's just so much.""At least two other Black men have been found hanged from trees in other parts of the country in the last couple weeks. Malcolm Harsch, 38, was found hanging from a tree[2] in a homeless encampment in Victorville, California on May 31st. Police said there were ""no indications at the scene that suggested foul play,"" and ruled the death a suicide. But Harsch's family, who live in Ohio, have questioned that ruling.'Malcolm had very recent conversations with his children about seeing them soon. He didn't seem to be depressed to anyone who truly knew him,"" the family said in a statement. ""EVERYONE who knew our brother was shocked to hear that he allegedly hung himself and don't believe it to be true as well as the people who were there when his body was discovered There are many ways to die but considering the current racial tension, a black man hanging himself from a tree definitely doesn't sit well with us right now. We want justice not comfortable excuses.'Two weeks later, 24-year-old Robert Fuller was also found hanging from a tree[3] in Palmdale, California on June 10th. The L.A. County Chief Medical Examiner-Coroner initially ruled it a suicide, based on the fact that there was no evidence of foul play, but the family disputed the circumstances, and the L.A.

This summer, a bipartisan group of about a hundred academics, journalists, pollsters, former government officials and former campaign staff members convened for an initiative called the Transition Integrity Project. By video conference, they met to game out hypothetical threats to the November election and a peaceful transfer of power if the Democratic candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden, were to win. Dividing into Team Trump and Team Biden, the group ran various scenarios about counting ballots and the litigation and protests and violence that could follow a contested election result. The idea was to test the machinery of American democracy.
Describing the results in a Sept. 3 essay in The Washington Post, one of the project’s organizers, Rosa Brooks, a Georgetown law professor and Pentagon official during the Obama administration, mentioned a situation in which Biden won the popular vote but lost in the Electoral College. In that hypothetical case, “desperate Democrats” on Team Biden considered encouraging California and the Pacific Northwest to threaten secession to pressure Republicans to expand the size of the Senate.
The next day, Michael Anton, a former national security adviser to President Trump, published an article about the Transition Integrity Project called “The Coming Coup?” Democrats were “laying the groundwork for revolution,” Anton wrote without evidence in The American Mind, a publication of the Claremont Institute. He warned that ballots harvested “lawfully or not” could tip close states to Biden.
To hear more audio stories from publishers like The New York Times, download Audm for iPhone or Android.
By mid-September, Anton’s article was one of the most-shared links in extremist online communities, according to a newsletter published by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a think tank based in London. Dan Bongino, a podcaster and Trump supporter, covered Anton’s essay and the imagined coup in several videos, with one tagged, “They are telling you what they are going to do!” Just two of the videos pulled in at least six million views.
On Sept. 9, a post appeared on Revolver News, a new right-wing website. It claimed without evidence that one participant in the Transition Integrity Project, Norm Eisen, who served as a counsel for the Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee during the impeachment proceedings, was a “central operative” in a “color revolution” against Trump, a term for uprisings that have toppled governments in countries like Georgia and Ukraine. Trump tweeted in praise of Revolver News a few days later.
On Sept. 15, the Fox News host Tucker Carlson had on his show Darren Beattie, a former Trump speechwriter who was fired after reports surfaced that he had attended a gathering of white nationalists in 2016 and who warned about Eisen and a color revolution. Two days later, Trump tweeted that “the Nov 3rd Election result may NEVER BE ACCURATELY DETERMINED, which is what some want,” generating tens of thousands of interactions on Twitter and a round of news coverage about one of the fears that the Transition Integrity Project sought to address — that Trump could refuse to accept the results of the election.
All told, in September the coup fabrication was shared more than 100,000 times from public Facebook pages, generating many millions of interactions and video views, according to the data source CrowdTangle. Alongside Bongino and Fox News, there were small drivers of traffic like Long Islanders for Trump, the Silent Majority Group and a county Republican organization in Oregon, as well as private groups with thousands of members that CrowdTangle doesn’t capture. By the end of the month, the fraction of Republicans who were not “confident” that the election “will be conducted in a fair and equal way” hit 65 percent, higher than it was for independents or Democrats, in an NBC News/SurveyMonkey tracking poll. This month, Trump retweeted a response to a Republican member of Congress, Mark Green, who suggested that Speaker Nancy Pelosi could stage a coup.
The United States is in the middle of a catastrophic public-health crisis caused by the spread of the coronavirus. But it is also in the midst of an information crisis caused by the spread of viral disinformation, defined as falsehoods aimed at achieving a political goal. (“Misinformation” refers more generally to falsehoods.) Seven months into the pandemic in America, with Trump leading the way, coronavirus skeptics continue to mock masks and incorrectly equate the virus with the flu. Throughout the campaign season, Trump and other Republicans have promoted a false narrative of widespread voter fraud, which Attorney General William Barr, as the country’s top law-enforcement official, furthered in a September interview on CNN when he said someone in Texas was indicted for filling out 1,700 ballots for other people, which never happened. As fires tore through California and the Pacific Northwest last month, the president cast doubt on the science behind global warming, and people in Oregon defied evacuation orders because of false rumors that antifa, a loose term for left-wing activists, was setting the blazes and looting empty homes.
The conspiracy theories, the lies, the distortions, the overwhelming amount of information, the anger encoded in it — these all serve to create chaos and confusion and make people, even nonpartisans, exhausted, skeptical and cynical about politics. The spewing of falsehoods isn’t meant to win any battle of ideas. Its goal is to prevent the actual battle from being fought, by causing us to simply give up. And the problem isn’t just the internet. A working paper from the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard released early this month found that effective disinformation campaigns are often an “elite-driven, mass-media led process” in which “social media played only a secondary and supportive role.” Trump’s election put him in the position to operate directly through Fox News and other conservative media outlets, like Rush Limbaugh’s talk-radio show, which have come to function “in effect as a party press,” the Harvard researchers found.
The false story about Democrats plotting a coup spread through a typical feedback loop. Links from Fox News hosts and other right-wing figures aligned with Trump, like Bongino, often dominate the top links in Facebook’s News Feed for likes, comments and shares in the United States. Though Fox News is far smaller than Facebook, the social media platform has helped Fox attain the highest weekly reach, offline and online combined, of any single news source in the United States, according to a 2020 report by the Reuters Institute.
It’s an article of faith in the United States that more speech is better and that the government should regulate it as little as possible. But increasingly, scholars of constitutional law, as well as social scientists, are beginning to question the way we have come to think about the First Amendment’s guarantee of free speech. They think our formulations are simplistic — and especially inadequate for our era. Censorship of external critics by the government remains a serious threat under authoritarian regimes. But in the United States and other democracies, there is a different kind of threat, which may be doing more damage to the discourse about politics, news and science. It encompasses the mass distortion of truth and overwhelming waves of speech from extremists that smear and distract.
This concern spans the ideological spectrum. Along with disinformation campaigns, there is the separate problem of “troll armies” — a flood of commenters, often propelled by bots — that “aim to discredit or to destroy the reputation of disfavored speakers and to discourage them from speaking again,” Jack Goldsmith, a conservative law professor at Harvard, writes in an essay in “The Perilous Public Square,” a book edited by David E. Pozen that was published this year. This tactic, too, may be directed by those in power. Either way, it’s often grimly effective at muting critical voices. And yet as Tim Wu, a progressive law professor at Columbia, points out in the same book, the “use of speech as a tool to suppress speech is, by its nature, something very challenging for the First Amendment to deal with.”
These scholars argue something that may seem unsettling to Americans: that perhaps our way of thinking about free speech is not the best way. At the very least, we should understand that it isn’t the only way. Other democracies, in Europe and elsewhere, have taken a different approach. Despite more regulations on speech, these countries remain democratic; in fact, they have created better conditions for their citizenry to sort what’s true from what’s not and to make informed decisions about what they want their societies to be. Here in the United States, meanwhile, we’re drowning in lies.
Facts and transparency are the intended pillars of the modern First Amendment. Since the nation’s founding, the Constitution has guaranteed that the government “shall make no law” abridging “the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble.” For more than a century, however, these limits on the state’s power were worth little. From 1798 to 1801, more than two dozen people, including several newspaper editors, were prosecuted by the administration of President John Adams under the Alien and Sedition Acts, which made “malicious writing” a crime. Protesters were also jailed for criticizing the government during World War I.
In 1919, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. invoked the First Amendment to dispute the legality of prosecuting five anarchists for distributing leaflets that called for workers to strike at munitions factories. “The ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas,” Holmes wrote.
One of Holmes’s chief influences was the British philosopher John Stuart Mill, who argued in his foundational 1859 treatise “On Liberty” that it is wrong to censor ideas, because knowledge arises from the “clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error.” In the process, the capacity of citizens to weigh policy questions is strengthened. The government should not censor false or harmful speech because its judgment might be wrong.
Based on Mill’s conception of free speech, the political theorist Alexander Meiklejohn argued for elevating the right above other rights, as the foundation of democracy, in his 1948 book “Free Speech and its Relation to Self-Government.” Mill and Meiklejohn stand for the proposition that unfettered debate — Holmes’s “free trade in ideas,” or the “marketplace of ideas,” coined by Justice William O. Douglas in 1953 — furthers the bedrock values of the pursuit of truth, individual autonomy and democratic self-governance.
In the 1960s, based on these principles, Supreme Court majorities laid the cornerstones of modern American free-speech protections. In the case Brandenburg v. Ohio, the justices struck down an Ohio law used to arrest a Ku Klux Klan leader for speaking at a rally, barring the government from punishing speech unless it encouraged and was likely to cause “imminent lawless action,” like a riot. In the foundational case New York Times v. Sullivan, the court made it difficult for a public figure to sue a newspaper for libel that included false statements. Errors were “inevitable in free debate,” the court said, and “must be protected if the freedoms of expression are to have the ‘breathing space’ that they ‘need,’” quoting a previous ruling.
It’s a fundamentally optimistic vision: Good ideas win. The better argument will prove persuasive.
There’s a countertradition, however. It’s alert to the ways in which demagogic leaders or movements can use propaganda, an older term that can be synonymous with disinformation. A crude authoritarian censors free speech. A clever one invokes it to play a trick, twisting facts to turn a mob on a subordinated group and, in the end, silence as well as endanger its members. Looking back at the rise of fascism and the Holocaust in her 1951 book “The Origins of Totalitarianism,” the political philosopher Hannah Arendt focused on the use of propaganda to “make people believe the most fantastic statements one day, and trust that if the next day they were given irrefutable proof of their falsehood, they would take refuge in cynicism.”
In other words, good ideas do not necessarily triumph in the marketplace of ideas. “Free speech threatens democracy as much as it also provides for its flourishing,” the philosopher Jason Stanley and the linguist David Beaver argue in their forthcoming book, “The Politics of Language.”
Concerns about the harm of unfettered speech have flared on the left in the United States since the 1970s. In that decade, some feminists, led by the legal scholar Catharine A. MacKinnon and the activist Andrea Dworkin, fought to limit access to pornography, which they viewed as a form of subordination and a violation of women’s civil rights. In the 1980s and ’90s, scholars developing critical race theory, which examines the role of law in maintaining race-based divisions of power, called for a reading of the First Amendment that recognized racist hate speech as an injury that courts could redress.
But the Supreme Court has strongly protected hate speech. In 1992, the Supreme Court unanimously said that the City of St. Paul could not specially punish, as a hate crime, the public burning of a cross or the display of a swastika. In 2011, in an 8-to-1 vote, the court said the government could not stop members of the Westboro Baptist Church in Kansas from picketing military funerals across the nation to protest what they perceived to be the government’s tolerance of homosexuality by holding signs like “Thank God for Dead Soldiers.” Speech can “inflict great pain,” Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote for the majority. “On the facts before us, we cannot react to that pain by punishing the speaker. As a Nation we have chosen a different course — to protect even hurtful speech on public issues to ensure that we do not stifle public debate.”
In 2012, by a 6-to-3 vote in United States v. Alvarez, the court provided some constitutional protection for an individual’s intentional lies, at least as long as they don’t cause serious harm. The majority said that the “mere potential” for government censorship casts “a chill the First Amendment cannot permit if free speech, thought and discourse are to remain a foundation of our freedom.”
The Supreme Court has also taken the First Amendment in another direction that had nothing to do with individual rights, moving from preserving a person’s freedom to dissent to entrenching the power of wealthy interests. In the 1970s, the court started protecting corporate campaign spending alongside individual donations. Legally speaking, corporate spending on speech that was related to elections was akin to the shouting of protesters. This was a “radical break with the history and traditions of U.S. law,” the Harvard law professor John Coates wrote in a 2015 article published by the University of Minnesota Law School. Over time, the shift helped to fundamentally alter the world of politics. In the 2010 Citizens United decision, the court’s conservative majority opened the door to allowing corporations (and unions) to spend unlimited amounts on political advocacy, as long as they donated to interest groups and political-action committees rather than to campaigns.
By requiring the state to treat alike categories of speakers — corporations and individuals — the Supreme Court began to go far beyond preventing discrimination based on viewpoint or the identity of an individual speaker. “Once a defense of the powerless, the First Amendment over the last hundred years has mainly become a weapon of the powerful,” MacKinnon, now a law professor at the University of Michigan, wrote in “The Free Speech Century,” a 2018 essay collection. Instead of “radicals, artists and activists, socialists and pacifists, the excluded and the dispossessed,” she wrote, the First Amendment now serves “authoritarians, racists and misogynists, Nazis and Klansmen, pornographers and corporations buying elections.” In the same year, Justice Elena Kagan warned that the court’s conservative majority was “weaponizing the First Amendment” in the service of corporate interests, in a dissent to a ruling against labor unions.
If Trump’s deeply conservative third Supreme Court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, is confirmed, the court will most likely become more committed to its path of using the First Amendment to empower corporations. Somewhere along the way, the conservative majority has lost sight of an essential point: The purpose of free speech is to further democratic participation. “The crucial function of protecting speech is to give persons the sense that the government is theirs, which we might call democratic legitimation,” says the Yale law professor Robert Post. “Campbell Soup Company can’t experience democratic legitimation. But a person can. If we lose one election, we can win the next one. We can continue to identify with the democratic process so long as we’re given the opportunity to shape public opinion. That’s why we have the First Amendment.”
On May 16, 2017, Fox News posted an article that drew on a report from the local Fox station in Washington, laying out a conspiracy theory about the death of Seth Rich, a staff member at the Democratic National Committee who was apparently the victim of an attempted street robbery. The story falsely implicated Rich in the Russian hacking of committee emails, which were released by WikiLeaks during the 2016 presidential campaign. Sean Hannity amplified the lies about Rich on his Fox News show that night and the former House speaker Newt Gingrich repeated them on “Fox &amp; Friends” a few days later. The falsehoods spread to conspiracy websites and social media. Fox News retracted its false report online a week later, but “Fox &amp; Friends” did not; Hannity said on his radio show, “I retracted nothing.” An ABC affiliate owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group, a conservative owner of local TV stations, then aired another report on the Rich conspiracy theory, which the local Fox station covered, giving it life for another news cycle.
In a 2018 book, “Network Propaganda,” Yochai Benkler, a director of the Berkman Klein Center at Harvard, and two researchers there, Robert Faris and Hal Roberts, mapped the spread of political disinformation in the United States from 2015 to 2018. Analyzing the hyperlinks of four million news articles, the three authors found that the conservative media did not counter lies and distortions, but rather recycled them from one outlet to the next, on TV and radio and through like-minded websites.
The dearth of competition for factual accuracy among conservative outlets leaves their audiences vulnerable to disinformation even if the mainstream news media combats it. People are more likely to believe fact-checking from a source that speaks against its apparent political interest, research shows. In the eyes of many conservatives, news outlets like The Washington Post, The New York Times and CNN do not fill that role when they challenge a story that Trump and Fox News promote.
Mainstream publications also make mistakes or run with a hyped narrative. The repeated front-page coverage that The New York Times gave to Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server, after breaking the story, shadowed her defeat in 2016. It was also skewered by press critics — an example of how competing outlets challenge and correct one another (even if the system sometimes fails in real time). This “reality-check dynamic” in the mainstream and left-leaning media, Benkler, Faris and Roberts write, “still leaves plenty of room for partisanship.” But the standards of journalism, however flawed, appear to “significantly constrain disinformation.”
In the past, ensuring a vibrant free press made up of competing outlets was an express aim of federal policy. From the founding until the early 20th century, Congress lowered the cost of starting and running a newspaper or magazine by setting low postage rates for mailed copies. The advent of radio raised questions about how to foster competition and public access. “Lawmakers of both parties recognized the danger that an information chokehold poses to democratic self-government,” says Ellen P. Goodman, a law professor at Rutgers University. “So policymakers adopted structures to ensure diversity of ownership, local control of media and public broadcasting.”
In 1927, when Congress created the licensing system for exclusive rights to the broadcast spectrum, so that radio broadcasters could secure a place on the dial, lawmakers told broadcasters to act “as if people of a community should own a station.” The 1934 Communications Act similarly required anyone with a broadcast license to operate in the “public interest” and allocated spectrum based on ensuring that local communities had their own stations. In 1949, the Federal Communications Commission established the fairness doctrine, which interpreted operating in the public interest to require broadcasters to cover major public-policy debates and present multiple points of view. And in 1967, Congress created and funded the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, whose mission is to “promote an educated and informed civil society,” and reserved broadcast spectrum for local NPR and PBS stations.
During these decades, broadcasters were held to a standard of public trusteeship, in which the right to use the airwaves came with a mandate to provide for democratic discourse. Broadcasters made money — lots of it — but profit wasn’t their only reason for existing. “The networks had a public-service obligation, and when they went to get their licenses renewed, the news divisions fulfilled that,” says Matthew Gentzkow, an economist at Stanford who studies trust in information. The model coincided with a rare period, in American history, of relatively high levels of trust in media and low levels of political polarization.
But public trusteeship for broadcast and diverse ownership began to unravel with the libertarian shift of the Reagan era. In the mid-1980s, the administration waived the F.C.C. rule that barred a single entity from owning a TV station and a daily newspaper in the same local market to allow Rupert Murdoch to continue to own The New York Post and The Boston Herald after he bought his first broadcast TV stations in New York and Boston.
The F.C.C. repealed the fairness doctrine, which had required broadcasters to include multiple points of view, in 1987. “When that went, that was the beginning of the complete triumph, in media, of the libertarian view of the First Amendment,” the Rutgers law professor Goodman says.
Murdoch and Roger Ailes, a former Nixon campaign adviser, started Fox News as the first TV network to cultivate a conservative audience in 1996. A decade later, studies showed what has become known as the Fox News Effect: After a local cable system adds Fox News to the lineup, voters in the vicinity tend to shift toward Republican candidates. As Trump’s ally and frequent platform, Fox News can help shift its audience’s behavior toward his views even when they may risk public health. In a study this year, a team of economists, controlling for other factors, found that communities with higher numbers of Fox News viewers were less likely to comply with stay-at-home orders to fight coronavirus.
In the early ’90s, David D. Smith, a conservative who inherited the Sinclair Broadcast Group from his father, bought a second local TV station in Pittsburgh, despite a federal regulation barring the ownership of more than one station in a local market. In Baltimore, Sinclair got around the same rule by creating another company, Glencairn, controlled by Smith’s mother and an employee. Sinclair is growing as local journalism is hollowing out: About 1,800 metro and community newspapers have closed or merged since 2004. Sinclair is now the largest station owner in swing states.
More than three-quarters of Americans say they trust local TV news, according to a recent survey by the Poynter Institute. Sinclair owns local affiliates of CBS, ABC, NBC and the CW, as well as Fox, so its partisan leanings aren’t immediately apparent. But they’re there. “We are here to deliver your message — period.” Smith reportedly told Trump during the 2016 campaign. In early 2018, dozens of Sinclair newscasters across the country echoed Trump’s diatribes against the press by reading from the same script warning of “fake stories” from “some members” of the media. (Deadspin captured the repetition of the script in an eerie video montage.) In July, Sinclair released online an interview with Judy Mikovits, a conspiracy theorist who has accused Dr. Anthony Fauci of manufacturing the coronavirus. When the segment drew criticism, the company canceled the planned on-air broadcast but called itself “a supporter of free speech and a marketplace of ideas and viewpoints, even if incredibly controversial.”
The founding ethos of the internet was to treat sources of information equally. Cut loose from traditional gatekeepers — the publishing industry and the government — the web would provide the world’s first neutral delivery of content. But in short order, the libertarian principles that weakened media regulation allowed a few American tech companies to become the new gatekeepers. The United States gave platforms like Google, Facebook and Twitter free rein to grow. Google bought YouTube. Facebook bought Instagram and WhatsApp.
The business model for the dominant platforms depends on keeping users engaged online. Content that prompts hot emotion tends to succeed at generating clicks and shares, and that’s what the platforms’ algorithms tend to promote. Lies go viral more quickly than true statements, research shows.
In many ways, social media sites today function as the public square. But legally speaking, internet platforms can restrict free speech far more than the government can. They’re like malls, where private owners police conduct. Facebook, YouTube and Twitter have guidelines that moderate content that could drive away users, including spam and pornography, and also certain forms of harassment, hate speech, fake engagement or misrepresentation and violent extremism. But for years, the companies enforced these rules subjectively and unevenly — allowing for explosions of anti-Semitic memes and targeted harassment of women, for example.
Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Jack Dorsey of Twitter have each said that their sites cannot be “arbiters of truth” and make important exceptions to their guidelines. Facebook leaves up content, including hate speech, that breaks the rules when it decides it’s newsworthy, because it’s a post from a politician or a public figure. “In the same way that news outlets will report what a politician says,” Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post in June, “we think people should generally be able to see it for themselves on our platforms.”
Social media sites have leaned on First Amendment principles to keep secret the identities of people who appear to abuse their services. Following the right-wing news coverage of the conspiracy theory about Seth Rich, his brother subpoenaed Twitter, in a defamation suit against media companies, to uncover the name of the person behind the Twitter account @whysprtech, alleging that person sent to Fox News a forged F.B.I. document about Rich’s case. Twitter fought back in court, saying that unmasking @whysprtech would chill speech by violating what the platform’s lawyers called a constitutional right to be anonymous. This month, a judge ordered Twitter to reveal information that could unmask the person or people behind @whysprtech.
Over the past two months, as Trump attacked mail-in voting and the validity of the November election results, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter said they would impose a few more controls on speech about voting. The platforms expanded or reaffirmed their policies for removing a narrow category of content that misleads people about how to vote — for example, by saying you can fill out a ballot online.
In September, Facebook and YouTube joined Twitter in adding labels to content that a fact check has noted could undermine the results of the election or mislead about the results. (Facebook contracts with an independent fact-checking network, which includes both The Associated Press and Check Your Fact, a subsidiary of the right-wing outlet The Daily Caller. Twitter does fact-checking internally. YouTube relies on a network of news organizations, including PolitiFact and The Washington Post Fact Checker.)
Fact-checking and labeling are First Amendment-friendly responses. They counter false speech with more speech, at the initiative of a private company, not the direction of the government. Today the research consensus among social scientists is that some fact-checking methods significantly reduce the prevalence of false beliefs. In print or on TV, journalists can use headlines or chyrons to provide context and debunking in real time — though they sometimes fail to do so.
Until very recently, Facebook and Twitter used mild labeling language. On Sept. 28, Trump tweeted: “The Ballots being returned to States cannot be accurately counted. Many things are already going very wrong!” In small blue print at the bottom of the post, Twitter added a warning symbol — a small exclamation point in a circle — along with the text “Learn how voting by mail is safe and secure.” Facebook labeled the same post, suggesting that voters visit its “Voting Information Center” without including a warning symbol.
Kate Starbird, a professor of human-computer interaction at the University of Washington who tracks social media disinformation, called Facebook’s label “worse than nothing.” Adding a weak label to a Trump post mostly has the effect of “giving it an attention bump by creating a second news cycle about Republican charges of bias in content moderation,” says Nathaniel Persily, a Stanford law professor and co-director of the university’s Program on Democracy and the Internet.
Facebook has since updated its labels, based on tests and feedback, including from civil rights leaders. “The labels we have now, we have far more than we used to,” says Monika Bickert, Facebook’s vice president for content policy. “They’ve gotten stronger. But I would expect we’ll continue to refine them as we keep seeing what’s working.” Facebook updated the label on Trump’s Sept. 28 tweet to “Both voting in person and voting by mail have a long history of trustworthiness in the US and the same is predicted this year. Source: Bipartisan Policy Center.” On an Oct. 6 Trump post with more falsehoods about voting, Facebook added an additional sentence to that label: “Voter fraud is extremely rare across voting methods.” (Other labels, though, remain mild, and plenty of misleading content related to voting remains unlabeled.)
Angelo Carusone, the president of Media Matters for America, a nonprofit media watchdog group, finds the changes useful but frustratingly late. “We went from them refusing to touch any of the content, an entire ocean of disinformation on voting and election integrity, and dismissal of any efforts to address that — to this. They let it metastasize, and now they start doing the thing they could have done all along.” Carusone also points out that independent researchers don’t have access to data that would allow them to study key questions about the companies’ claims of addressing disinformation. How prevalent are disinformation and hate speech on the platforms? Are people who see Facebook, Twitter and YouTube’s information labels less likely to share false and misleading content? Which type of warning has the greatest impact?
Twitter and Facebook reduce the spread of some false posts, but during this election season, Starbird has watched false content shared or retweeted tens of thousands of times or more before companies make any visible effort to address it. “Currently, we are watching disinformation go viral &amp; trying desperately to refute it,” she tweeted in September. “By the time we do — even in cases where platforms end up taking action — the false info/narrative has already done its damage.”
Facebook came under intense criticism for the role it played in the last presidential race. During the 2016 campaign, Facebook later reported, Russian operatives spent about $100,000 to buy some 3,000 ads meant to benefit Trump largely by sowing racial division. By choosing Facebook, a small investment had an outsize payoff as the site’s users circulated the planted ads to their followers. “Facebook’s scale means we’ve concentrated our risk,” says Brendan Nyhan, a political scientist at Dartmouth College. “When they’re wrong, they’re wrong on a national or global scale.”
Facebook and YouTube have treated political ads as protected speech, allowing them to include false and misleading information. Online ads — like direct mail and robocalls — can make setting the record straight very difficult. Online advertisers can use microtargeting to pinpoint the segments of users they want to reach. “Misleading TV ads can be countered and fact-checked,” while a misleading message in a microtargeted ad “remains hidden from challenge by the other campaign or the media,” Zeynep Tufekci, a sociologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the author of the 2017 book “Twitter and Tear Gas,” wrote in a prescient 2012 Op-Ed in The New York Times.
In this election season, domestic groups are adopting similar tactics. This summer, the Trump-aligned group FreedomWorks, which was seeded by the billionaire Koch brothers, promoted 150 Facebook ads directing people to a page with a picture of LeBron James. The image was accompanied by a quote, in which James denounced poll closures as racist, that was repurposed to deceive people into thinking he was discouraging voting by mail. After The Washington Post reported on it, Facebook removed the page for violating its voter-interference policy, but only after the ads were seen hundreds of thousands of times.
Coordinated fake accounts posting about the election have also shown up on Twitter. In August, NBC News reported on a series of viral tweets that appeared to be from Black men who said they were lifelong Democrats and planned to leave the party. The accounts were fake; one used a stock photo of a Black man, and the other used a photo of a Dutch model. Twitter eventually took them down. The company recently said that as of Oct. 20, it is making more changes to protect the election, including temporarily warning users if they try to share content that the platform has flagged as false.
Another reason political ads are controversial online is that campaigns or groups that pay for them don’t have to disclose their identities, as they’re required to do on TV and radio and in print. “The First Amendment value of individual autonomy means we should know who is speaking to us and why,” the Rutgers law professor Goodman argues. But online, neither the Supreme Court nor Congress has stepped in to require disclosure.
Twitter banned political ads a year ago. This month, Facebook said it would temporarily ban political ads after the polls close on Nov. 3. Last month, the company took another step to protect the U.S. election. It restricted its Messenger app by preventing mass forwarding of private messages, which has done terrible damage in other countries. For several years, falsehoods that were forwarded from person to person, and from group to group, in private encrypted messages on WhatsApp sparked riots and fatal beatings against religious and ethnic minorities in countries including Bangladesh, India, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. In 2018, Facebook started limiting the forwarding of any post on WhatsApp to 20 people; now the limit is five for WhatsApp and Messenger.
As social media companies have tried to address the spread of disinformation and other toxic speech, conservatives including Trump have hurled a series of accusations that the companies are showing bias against them. In May, after Twitter first added labels that read “Get the facts about mail-in ballots” to two Trump tweets predicting mass ballot fraud, the president signed a largely symbolic executive order directed at social media sites, calling the platforms’ labels “selective censorship that is harming our national discourse.”
In February, The Washington Post reported on an internal effort by Facebook (called Project P, for propaganda) after the 2016 election to take down pages that spread Russian disinformation. The project foundered after Joel Kaplan, Facebook’s vice president for global public policy, reportedly said at a high-level meeting, “We can’t remove all of it because it will disproportionately affect conservatives,” according to a source at Facebook who spoke to The Post anonymously. In an email this month, a Facebook representative said Kaplan’s point about Project P was that the company “needed a clear basis for the removal because the impact would be felt more on the right than the left, and we would face criticism.”
Kaplan has deep Republican ties. He was present at the so-called Brooks Brothers Riot in Florida shortly after the contested presidential election in 2000, when a group of Republicans in suits succeeded in stopping a recount of ballots to the benefit of their candidate, George W. Bush. In 2018, he sat behind his close friend Brett Kavanaugh during Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing for the Supreme Court. (Kaplan apologized after some of his employees objected that his appearance seemed like a Facebook endorsement of Kavanaugh.)
Facebook employees have also raised questions about whether Facebook’s misinformation policy is enforced evenhandedly. According to the policy, publications and individual users will receive a “misinformation strike” for a post that a fact checker determines is false or misleading. A publication with multiple misinformation strikes in 90 days is supposed to lose its eligibility to be in Facebook News, a curated section that generates traffic for publications. (The New York Times is in Facebook News.) In August, Buzzfeed reported that at an all-hands meeting the previous month, Facebook employees asked Zuckerberg how Breitbart News remained a news partner after sharing the video in which doctors called hydroxychloroquine “a cure for Covid” and said “you don’t need a mask.” Through Breitbart’s page, the video racked up more than 20 million views in several hours before Facebook removed it. Zuckerberg said Breitbart didn’t have a second strike within the 90-day period.
But in an internal message group, employees wrote that misinformation strikes against Breitbart had been “cleared without explanation,” and gathered evidence of “preferential treatment” to help conservative accounts in these situations, according to Buzzfeed. One of the employees was later fired; Facebook said it was because “he broke the rules.” When I spoke to Bickert, she said Breitbart was cleared by her team because of “glitches” in Facebook’s system, such as not accurately notifying the publisher. This has happened “to publishers on the left and the right,” Bickert said.
In the last two years, employees have left Facebook sounding an alarm. In 2019, Yael Eisenstat resigned from her role as Facebook’s head of elections integrity after failing to persuade the company to combat misinformation in political ads. In a November op-ed in The Washington Post, she called on the company to stop profiting “from providing politicians with potent information-warfare tools.” Resigning from Facebook this summer, two software engineers, Max Wang and Ashok Chandwaney, separately accused the company of “profiting from hatred.” Sophie Zhang, a data scientist who was fired from Facebook in September, wrote a 6,600-word memo with details about disinformation campaigns she found to influence elections in countries including Ecuador, Honduras and Ukraine. “I have blood on my hands,”she wrote.
John Stuart Mill wrote a century and a half ago that “All silencing of discussion is an assumption of infallibility.” There is still plenty of reason to believe that moving away from the American free-speech tradition could make us too quick to dismiss apparently false ideas that turn out to have merit — and that airing them is the only way to find out. At Howard University’s commencement in 2016, President Barack Obama warned students against pushing colleges to disinvite speakers, “no matter how ridiculous or offensive you might find the things that come out of their mouths.” Instead, he told them, “beat them on the battlefield of ideas.”
In the last several years, however, some liberals have lost patience with rehashing debates about ideas they find toxic. The American Civil Liberties Union celebrated its decision in 1977 to defend the free speech rights of Nazis to march in Skokie, Ill. Forty years later, some lawyers and board members for the A.C.L.U. objected when the group defended the neo-Nazis who demonstrated in Charlottesville, Va.
Cancel culture — subjecting people to professional or social penalties for their views — has unsettled universities and workplaces. Liberal students have shouted down conservative speakers including Charles Murray and Christina Hoff Sommers. Conservatives have also condemned speakers and academics, for example, for supporting Palestinian rights. The New York Times’s decision this summer to publish an Op-Ed in which Senator Tom Cotton called for sending in federal troops to crack down on protests against the police roiled the paper’s staff. Citing a “significant breakdown in our editing processes,” the publisher, A.G. Sulzberger, announced the resignation of the editorial-page editor, James Bennet.
The First Amendment doesn’t have a formal role in these situations — newspapers and universities can decide which views they want to promote — but the principle that it’s paramount to protect dissident speech makes them difficult to untangle. If people have the right to peacefully protest against the police, don’t neo-Nazis have the same right to peacefully demonstrate? Why is Tom Cotton’s Op-Ed beyond the pale but not an October Op-Ed by Regina Ip, a legislator in Hong Kong, who defended police officers’ filling the streetsand arresting hundreds of pro-democracy demonstrators?
The principle of free speech has a different shape and meaning in Europe. For the European Union, as well as democracies like Canada and New Zealand, free speech is not an absolute right from which all other freedoms flow. The European high courts have allowed states to punish incitements of racial hatred or denial of the Holocaust, for example. Germany and France have laws that are designed to prevent the widespread dissemination of hate speech and election-related disinformation.“Much of the recent authoritarian experience in Europe arose out of democracy itself,” explains Miguel Poiares Maduro, board chairman of the European Digital Media Observatory, a project on online disinformation at the European University Institute. “The Nazis and others were originally elected. In Europe, there is historically an understanding that democracy needs to protect itself from anti-democratic ideas. It’s because of the different democratic ethos of Europe that Europe has accepted more restrictions on speech.”
After World War II, European countries also promoted free speech, and the flow of reliable information, by making large investments in public broadcasting. Today France TV, the BBC, ARD in Germany and similar broadcasters in the Netherlands and Scandinavia continue to score high in public trust and audience share. Researchers in Germany and France who have mapped the spread of political lies and conspiracy theories there say they have found pockets online, especially on YouTube, but nothing like the large-scale feedback loops in the United States that include major media outlets and even the president.
The difference between the political-speech traditions of the United States and Europe was acutely apparent in the American and French presidential elections of 2016 and 2017. When Russian operatives hacked into the computers of the Democratic National Committee, they gave their stolen trove of D.N.C. emails to WikiLeaks, which released the emails in batches to do maximum damage to Clinton and her party in the months before the election. The news media covered the stolen emails extensively, providing information so the public could weigh it, even if a foreign adversary had planted it.
The French press responded otherwise to a Russian hack in May 2017. Two days before a national election, the Russians posted online thousands of emails from En Marche!, the party of Emmanuel Macron, who was running for president. France, like several other democracies, has a blackout law that bars news coverage of a campaign for the 24 hours before an election and on Election Day. But the emails were available several hours before the blackout began. They were fair game. Yet the French media did not cover them. Le Monde, a major French newspaper, explained that the hack had “the obvious purpose of undermining the integrity of the ballot.”
Marine Le Pen, Macron’s far-right opponent, accused the news media of a partisan cover-up. But she had no sympathetic outlet to turn to, because there is no equivalent of Fox News or Breitbart in France. “The division in the French media isn’t between left and right,” said Dominique Cardon, director of the Media Lab at the university Sciences Po. “It’s between top and bottom, between professional outlets and some websites linked to very small organizations, or individuals on Facebook or Twitter or YouTube who share a lot of disinformation.” The faint impact of the Macron hack “is a good illustration of how it’s impossible to succeed at manipulation of the news just on social media,” said Arnaud Mercier, a professor of information and political communication at the University Paris 2 Panthéon-Assas. “The hackers needed the sustainment of the traditional media.”
The challenge of informing the public accurately about the coronavirus has also played out differently in the U.S. and Europe. In March, the World Health Organization appealed for help with what it called an “infodemic.” Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and others pledged to elevate “authoritative content” and combat misinformation about the virus around the world.
But in August, the global activist group Avaaz released a report showing that conspiracies and falsehoods about the coronavirus and other health issues circulated on Facebook through at least May, far more frequently than posts by authoritative sources like W.H.O. and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Avaaz included web traffic from Britain, France, Germany and Italy, along with the United States, and found that the U.S. accounted for 89 percent of the comments, likes and shares of false and misleading health information. “A lot of U.S.-based entities are actually targeting other countries with misinformation in Italian or Spanish or Portuguese,” said Fadi Quran, the campaign director for Avaaz. “In our sample, the U.S. is by far the worst actor.”
America’s information crisis was not inevitable. Nor is it insoluble. Whatever the Supreme Court does, there’s no legal barrier to increasing the delivery of reliable information. The government, federal or state, could invest in efforts to do exactly that. It could stop the decline of local reporting by funding nonprofit journalism. It could create new publicly funded TV or radio to create more alternatives for media that appeals across the ideological spectrum. The only obstacles to such cures for America’s disinformation ills are political.
Last spring, when Twitter started labeling Trump’s misleading and false tweets about voting fraud, he called for revoking Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which Congress wrote in an early stage of the internet to help it grow. Section 230 effectively makes internet platforms, unlike other publishers, immune from libel and other civil suits for the content they carry. Biden also called for revoking Section 230 in January, citing Facebook for “propagating falsehoods they know to be false.”
Taking away the platforms’ immunity, however, seems like a bad fit for the problems at hand. The threat of being sued for libel could encourage platforms to avoid litigation costs by pre-emptively taking down content once someone challenges it. Some of that content would be disinformation and hate speech, but other material might be offensive but true — a risk of overcensorship.
But there’s another idea with bipartisan support: Make the platforms earn their immunity from lawsuits. The Rutgers law professor Goodman and others have proposed using Section 230 as leverage to push the platforms to be more transparent, for example, by disclosing how their algorithms order people’s news feeds and recommendations and how much disinformation and hate speech they circulate. A quid pro quo could go further, requiring the companies to change their algorithms or identify super-spreaders of disinformation and slow the virality of their posts. To make sure new media sites can enter the market, the government could exempt small start-ups but impose conditions on platforms with tens of millions of users.
Congress, as well as the Justice Department, can also promote competition through antitrust enforcement. In early October, the House Judiciary’s Committee’s Democratic leadership released a 449-page report, based on an extensive investigation, that said Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple have monopoly power in their markets like that of the “oil barons and railroad tycoons” of the early 20th century. “Because there is not meaningful competition, dominant firms face little financial consequence when misinformation and propaganda are promoted online,” the report stated.
There are plenty of ideas, and bills, floating around Washington that seek to improve the online speech environment — like the giant step of using antitrust law to break up the big tech companies, or medium-size steps like banning microtargeted political ads, requiring disclosure of the ad buyers, making the platforms file reports detailing when they remove content or reduce its spread. But the United States may miss the chance to lead. To fend off regulation and antitrust enforcement, the internet platforms spend millions of dollars on lobbying in Washington. They align their self-interest with a nationalist pitch, warning that curbing America’s homegrown tech companies would serve the interests of Chinese competitors like TikTok.
Europe, however, doesn’t have a stake in the dominance of American tech companies. Policymakers talk about the importance of maintaining the health of their democracies. “We see how the money of advertisers for extreme speech is shifting from the traditional media to digital media,” Věra Jourová, the vice president for values and transparency at the European Commission, told me this summer. “Google and Facebook are the big suckers of this money.” Among other things, Jourová mentioned regulating the platforms’ algorithms. “These issues here are not driven by big money like they are in the U.S., or by regressive ideas as in a state like China,” she said. Maduro of the European Digital Media Observatory has proposed treating the platforms like essential facilities, the European version of public utilities, and subjecting them to more regulation. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat, has outlined a similar idea in the U.S. It would be a huge shift.
As we hurtle toward the November election with a president who has trapped the country in a web of lies, with the sole purpose, it seems, of remaining in office, it’s time to ask whether the American way of protecting free speech is actually keeping us free. Hannah Arendt finished her classic work on totalitarianism in the early 1950s, after barely escaping Germany with her life, leaving friends and homeland behind. She was a Jewish intellectual who saw the Nazis rise to power by demonizing and blaming Jews and other groups with mockery and scorn. The ideal subject of fascist ideology was the person “for whom the distinction between fact and fiction (i.e. the reality of experience),” Arendt wrote, “and the distinction between true and false (i.e. the standards of thought) no longer exist.” An information war may seem to simply be about speech. But Arendt understood that what was at stake was far more.

ANNOUNCER: This is CNN Breaking News.
WOLF BLITZER, CNN HOST: Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington. This is a special edition of THE SITUATION ROOM.
The peaceful fight for change is continuing across the United States this Saturday night filling our streets with renewed calls for reforms after George Floyd's killing nearly two weeks ago. So far tonight we have not heard of any notable clashes or violence in the United States after a day of demonstrations that continue this hour.
Also tonight, CNN confirms that Philonise Floyd, George Floyd's brother, will testify before Congress on Wednesday. The House Judiciary Committee is investigating police practices and law enforcement accountability.
In Los Angeles, meanwhile, peaceful marchers filled a tunnel. It's the light of justice they seek at the end after countless examples of police overstepping their authority during confrontations with people of color.
And from down below to high above, the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco and the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City filled with thousands more demonstrators fighting for the Black Lives Matter movement.
And we can take you even higher. This is the view from space. Look at this. A satellite image. On the left the words Black Lives Matter now fill two entire city blocks in Washington, D.C. but not just any blocks. Look on the right. That's the White House. The massive street mural is part of D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser's instant creation of what is now officially called Black Lives Matter Plaza.
And back on the ground Mayor Bowser joined the crowds in that plaza earlier today as they called for action. Tens of thousands marched through Washington alone. As for the current occupant of the White House President Trump has been out of sight all day. We haven't heard from him on this crisis today with the exception of a three-word tweet. It doesn't read Black Lives Matter. It says ""Law and Order.""
Today we have seen perhaps the biggest protest yet here in the nation's capital. Alex Marquardt has been reporting live around Lafayette Square for us all day.
It's getting later into the evening now, Alex. Are you seeing people heading home? What's going on?
ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. And we believe, Wolf, that there were tens of thousands of people who took to the streets in the city of Washington, D.C. today.
This is Black Lives Matter Plaza as commissioned by the D.C. mayor just yesterday. It has been the scene of massive peaceful protests throughout the course of the day.
Wolf, you know Washington well. This is 16th Street. This is that long street that goes straight into the White House. You showed the viewers that satellite image of that Black Lives Matter painting on those two city blocks. What you're looking at now is protesters who have pushed others to the perimeter to add something of an addendum to that message.
We have seen a number of letters, new letters, painted on the street. And it looks like what they are about to write is ""Defund the Police,"" which of course is a refrain that we've been hearing all across the country.
We've seen lots of people climbing streetlights to take a picture next to that Black Lives Matter Plaza sign.
Wolf, I've spoken to people throughout the course of the week who have come from out of state. Not just Maryland and Virginia but New Jersey and New York. Come all the way down here to D.C. to protest because this city is the nation's capital because it is so symbolically important, and because they can protest right outside the White House.
[21:05:02]
Listen to what one man -- one protester told me earlier today about why these protests in D.C. are unique.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MARQUARDT: What's different, do you think, about doing this in Washington, D.C. versus other cities?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Washington, D.C. matters more than any other city in the world. This is the heart of the whole entire nation. When stuff is done here, everybody listens. Whether it's New York, California. But we matter. And this is where the president resides. So when we started, it becomes a trend. And D.C. has represented the world for so many years. And we needed to set an example for everybody to follow. And this is it. This is peaceful. Everybody's here. Everybody's together.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MARQUARDT: And now, Wolf, you can see this huge ""Black Lives Matter"" banner that is hanging from the fence that was installed earlier this week around the northern edge of Lafayette Park. This fence now stretching all the way around, most of the way around the White House. Behind this fence you've seen, Wolf, when we've been talking, law enforcement has been lined up, that is not the case tonight. That has not been the case for really the past 36 hours. And that is a reflection of how peaceful these protests have been.
And because, Wolf, they have been so peaceful, Mayor Bowser, who really has become an antagonist when it comes to President Trump by establishing this as Black Lives Matter Plaza, by painting this Black Lives Matter signage on the street right next to the White House, she has demanded that those forces that came to D.C. at the behest of the Trump administration, those federal forces that poured into the streets like from the Bureau of Prisons, the FBI, and multiple other agencies pull out of Washington, D.C.
We have new reporting from our colleague Ryan Browne who says that some of the 4,000 approximate National Guard troops who have come to D.C. from other states may be leaving as soon as Monday. And that will certainly be music to the mayor's ears. She said earlier today that she wanted to sound a warning about what happened here in terms of all those out-of-state forces, those federal officers pouring into the streets, so that it doesn't happen elsewhere -- Wolf.
BLITZER: All right, Alex, thanks very much. Alex Marquardt reporting.
Over on the West Coast, Los Angeles is likewise seeing widespread demonstrations. Lucy Kafanov is on the scene for us there.
Lucy, so tell us what you're seeing, what's going on.
LUCY KAFANOV, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Wolf. Well, this is one of dozens of demonstrations here in Los Angeles. I know my colleague Paul Vercammen is at another location. We have hundreds if not thousands of people gathering here as they have almost every single day this week. This is downtown Los Angeles. We're on the steps of the city hall building. Behind me is the courthouse.
And this is where demonstrators say they will continue to gather on a daily basis until they see the justice and the change that they demand. Now, one of the signs that we've seen over and over again, one of the chants has been to defund the police. There has been some action by city authorities on that level. The mayor announced that the L.A. City will be looking to cut $100 million to $150 million from the LAPD budget to reinvest that money into communities of color.
But that's not likely to be enough to quell these demonstrations. I should say that they have been peaceful. A lot of folks have been joining as they march down the street. They're gathered here right now to listen to speakers. But we have seen breakaway crowds start to march and we expect them to get on the move again.
What's interesting to me, what stands out to me is just how much of a diverse crowd this is, white people, black people, members of the Asian community, Latinos, all religions, all ages represented. The atmosphere here is passionate. There's also a sense of community feeling here. There's a lot of folks handing out masks and water and snacks, making sure that the demonstrators are well fed, well-watered, have everything that they need.
And not a lot of visible police presence. There are some policemen standing on the steps of city hall protecting this area, but no National Guard as we saw on Tuesday. No police in riot gear. Another visible effort by the city to sort of deescalate the tensions and prevent the scenes that we saw last weekend that involved a lot of difficult and heavy clashes. This is a very different atmosphere. And these demonstrators, Wolf, say that they will continue to stay in the streets until their message is heard -- Wolf.
BLITZER: All right, Lucy, thanks very much.
Let's stay in Los Angeles right now. Paul Vercammen not too far away. What are you seeing, Paul, where you are?
PAUL VERCAMMEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, I'm in the Fairfax District. And last week at this time we saw everything go haywire here, Wolf. This is where we had the confrontations. Now let me show you. This is sort of a dance-off, peaceful protest. People showing up. They're in the middle of the intersection.
[21:10:02]
And police are nowhere to be seen. It is clear that they're taking a hands-off approach right now with this demonstration in this part of Los Angeles. And you can see that sign right there, ""defund the police.""
Let me ask you a question really quick, young man. Defund the police.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, we want to reduce their funding. They have like too much money and resources. Put that money into things that can help people because they're just shooting unarmed black people and shooting at protesters and journalists like yourself.
VERCAMMEN: Appreciate your taking time out. Well, you can also see and you can hear -- let me just be quiet for one second here, Wolf. We'll let you hear the chanting.
(PROTESTERS CHANTING)
VERCAMMEN: And Wolf, as we come back here, they're saying, ""Whose streets? Our streets."" Well, this street is very busy. Beverly Boulevard. And right now it's being occupied and there are no police officers, National Guardsmen, any law enforcement in sight. I'll toss it back to you.
BLITZER: All right, Paul. Thank you. Paul Vercammen in L.A. From L.A. let's go to New York right now. Bill Weir is on the scene for us with a group of protesters.
Update our viewers what's happening where you are, Bill.
BILL WEIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, this has been a relatively quiet night. The groups have gotten smaller as the week progressed. We just heard police scanner traffic here. We're following this group that seems to be headed for the Manhattan Bridge that would cross into Brooklyn. According to the commander's voice we heard over the police scanner, if they try that they'll be arrested.
Most of today the protests were festive, very peaceful, and NYPD seemed to let folks wander wherever they wanted to go. But after sunset of course that's been a different story. And this will be a key interesting moment to see what the response is here. And to see how motivated these folks are to get over the bridge.
If they try, if they just use the pedestrian access they'll be allowed through. But about a half hour ago just as curfew fell many in this group took to the FDR Drive, one of the main arteries, one of the main highways on the east side of Manhattan. And -- but the police, you know, they could have swooped in on this crowd almost an hour ago if they'd wanted to and start sweeping them up for protests -- or for curfew violations. But they haven't done so yet.
Couple bits of news in New York. Four officers were reassigned as punishment. Actually, four commanders. The men in the white shirts. For their behavior during the early days of the protests. If you saw the viral videos of one commander pushing a woman down violently in the street, another one pulling a protester's mask down and pepper spraying him in the face. Those are the four that are being punished now.
Also Governor Andrew Cuomo today started really pushing his bill for police reform, which would include no more chokeholds. It would make calling 911 and making a -- you know, a false report based on race a hate crime. They would change the laws that would make sort of disciplinary records for NYPD much more transparent in this bill, and also put the attorney general in charge of any investigation that involves a civilian being killed at the hands of police.
Just some of the political pressure really being ramped up here. But now we're headed back into Chinatown. So really no telling. We're now headed back actually toward city hall and One Police Plaza. But this is the one -- it seems the one protest in New York City tonight, Wolf, in which people are defying curfew and seeing what comes next.
BLITZER: Which is very interesting. The curfew went into effect supposedly, what, an hour and 15 minutes or so ago in New York City. 8:00 p.m. Eastern, Bill. But nobody's bothering the protesters where you are, right?
WEIR: No, no. Not at all. I was listening to scanner traffic and hearing how they were just -- you know, calmly over the radio saying let them pass. If they use the pedestrian ways, let them pass. Different commanders in different precincts around the city have different attitudes about this. Uptown north of 59th Street a commander there is sort of notorious for cracking down right away as soon as the curfew drops. But there's nothing really happening up there.
[21:15:01]
So right now this is where the tension is. I saw one interesting interaction at the Manhattan Bridge earlier today when just a few dozen protesters squared off against police. And NYPD did sort of attack or retreat. They've turned around, walked away. It didn't seem worth it for them to pick up particular point of conflict.
Over here to the right you'll see -- I've seen this all day. People handing out free water and sign-making materials to protesters. And as we saw throughout most of the day the crowds was really diverse. Families out marching. Very peaceful. It was a musical second line New Orleans-style procession that went all around the city led by Jon Batiste, the band leader from Stephen Colbert's ""Late Show.""
And people singing along to Whitney Houston songs and ""When the Saints Go Marching In."" It was a very, very different attitude emotionally than we've seen all week as so much fear and anger and loathing. But tonight, as it seems, maybe because of the political pressure on these disturbing scenes of police officers around the country, using force on protesters, that the tactic is tonight to just let the crowd move as they want to and let it dissipate on their own. But who knows? I mean, it's still very early.
BLITZER: Yes, it's, what, just 9:16 here on the East Coast. Our Bill Weir. We'll stay in very close touch with you.
I want to bring in Ben Jealous right now. He's the incoming president of People for the American Way, the former head of the NAACP.
Ben, thank you so much for joining us. So you see what's going on. You've seen these protests continuing even after the curfew in New York City, for example. What do you think?
BEN JEALOUS, PRESIDENT-ELECT, PEOPLE FOR THE AMERICAN WAY: You know, I find it very exciting. It feels like we're at a tipping point on this issue. It's not just the protests we're seeing in the big cities. It's the protests we're seeing in small rural towns. And it really sends a signal that our country is finally at a place where maybe, maybe, finally, we can end the scourge of police killings that have been with us since the Boston massacre.
BLITZER: How important do you think these protests, nearly two weeks -- how important historically do you think they're going to turn out to be?
JEALOUS: Huge. You know, if you think about it for a second, you know, my great-grandparents' generation really forced the end of lynch mob killings in this country. And they did it by shaming department after department, voting out judge after judge and sheriff after sheriff. They never succeeded in passing the federal legislation. But they did stop the practice of lynch mob killings, which of course were facilitated by, tolerated by local law enforcement. And so we have the opportunity to do the same thing. And I think we're finally at the point where it feels like we can get there.
BLITZER: Because we've seen police acquitted in similar cases. You're very familiar. You're in Baltimore. The Freddie Gray case an example. What do you think's going to happen in the short term right now as we move forward?
JEALOUS: You know, I'm very hopeful that we will get a conviction in this case. The traffic killing of Freddie Gray, the murder of Freddie Gray, happened in a van. There was no video. What happened to George Floyd happened in the open. On the street. There's video. It's compelling. We've seen it. And so I'm very hopeful that we will get a conviction.
What is also very important is that we've stopped the next killing and the one after that and the one after that. And that's why it's so critical that we pass laws in cities across this country. More than half of black people live in about 20 metro areas in this country. We change the laws in those metro areas, we will have done a lot. 80 percent of black people live in 17 states. We change the laws in those states, we would have done a lot.
And so even in these hopefully final months of Trump being in office, when it's pretty clear he would veto any major federal legislation, there's reason to be hopeful that we can make real progress at the state level. Real progress at the city level. And frankly make the world safer for a whole lot of good people.
BLITZER: You know, it's really interesting. And we've discussed this, you know, Ben, and we're showing our viewers live pictures, of people marching in Los Angeles, people marching in New York City right now despite the curfew that supposedly was going into effect at 8:00 p.m. Eastern. It's now 9:19 p.m. Eastern. All this is happening almost organically. There's not one or even two or three national leaders who have emerged who are really setting some guidelines.
[21:20:04]
That's a pretty impressive development, isn't it?
JEALOUS: It is. And it's one of the reasons to be hopeful. If you just have one leader or a handful of leaders they can quickly be attacked and discredited. When it's coming from the bottom up in city after city, county after county, little town after little town, and when there's such clear consensus, that we have to change the culture of policing in this country and finally stop the killing of unarmed civilians, especially black women and black men, black children, then there's reason to be hopeful that this movement will be resilient and that we're reaching sort of a tipping point of public consensus where we can be hopeful that real change will come and come soon.
BLITZER: In an interview, you know, Ben, with the ""Baltimore Sun"" you said, and I'm quoting you now, ""Historians will look back on these COVID uprisings."" Tell us what you meant. JEALOUS: When you get beyond the moment of an uprising, you look back, and you look at the stats and what was happening, it's like an onion. The spark is always an act of police brutality. But honestly, that spark is going off in our country every day somewhere. What determines whether that spark catches fire and becomes a blaze is the amount of tension about joblessness, unemployment, housing, and I would say in this moment health care. And that's the way it's been throughout history.
And so yes, absolutely, the rage is about what happened to George Floyd and what's happened to so many other black women and black men and black children. And frankly many other people of many other colors as well. Police violence is worse in our community but it's not only in our community. And yet this blaze has really caught because of what's also happening in our society, which is that many states have the highest unemployment they've ever seen, people have really in a very raw way been impacted all at once by the fact that their health care is attached to their employment and they just lost their job.
And on top of that there's real anxiety about housing and unemployment. So I think that we will find that history will judge these protests. Yes, be about George Floyd but also be about the context in which they happened.
BLITZER: Yes. All right. Ben Jealous, the former president and CEO of the NAACP. Ben, as usual, thanks so much for joining us.
JEALOUS: Thank you, Wolf. Good to be here.
BLITZER: All right. Thank you.
Tonight, as the nationwide protest enters a 12th night look at these live pictures coming in. These are live pictures coming in from Chicago right now. We're watching what's going on there. We're watching what's going on elsewhere. We're also getting new details about how the pushback from the military over demand from the White House to put 10,000 troops on the streets of major American cities, how that's unfolding. Lots of news. We'll be right back.
[21:27:09]
BLITZER: We're learning more tonight about how the Trump administration sought to use the military to bring an end to nationwide protests. The White House wanted 10,000 active-duty U.S. military troops on the streets of Washington, D.C. and other major American cities. Senior Defense officials say the president's senior military leaders including the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Mark Milley and the Defense Secretary Mark Esper questioned if such a move would even be legal.
The reporting follows questions about the Defense secretary's standing with the president right now and tepid White House assurances that the president remains confident in Esper, the Defense secretary.
The former NATO Supreme Allied commander General Wesley Clark is joining us right now.
General Clark, thanks so much for joining us. As you know, Secretary Esper also recalling some active-duty forces from D.C. and made guardsman patrol without weapons. So what do you think of what's going on right now? Do you agree with all these actions?
GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET), FORMER NATO SUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER: Well, I certainly agree with all the protesters in the street. I'm glad it's mostly peaceful. I think that it's become not just a protest over Black Lives Matter over this -- over George Floyd, but I think it's become much larger over racism in America and even against the president's inflammatory rhetoric and language.
And wrapped in that issue is his propensity to want to use the military. You know, he started this by saying he was going to have his generals and every general I know found that phraseology extremely offensive. Generals don't belong to the president. They belong to the American people. They take an oath to the Constitution. And so from that point on the military's been on guard against the politicization of the Armed Forces by Donald Trump.
And it just boiled over after that action Monday night. People all over were furious. Active duty, retired, family members. And of course if you're one of the troops and you're in uniform and you're told to go somewhere and do something you're going to do it. And they don't have any real choice. They don't often see big issues because they haven't been at that level. They haven't been exposed to it. But believe me, these protests touch a lot of profound issues.
BLITZER: As you know, the president's former Defense secretary, his first Defense secretary, the retired four-star Marine Corps General James Mattis, said of the president earlier this week, and I'm quoting General Mattis, ""Never did I dream that troops taking that same oath would be ordered under any circumstance to violate the constitutional rights of their fellow citizens.""
[21:30:00]
You're a retired four-star general. What did you make of that?
CLARK: I thought it was a great statement. I'm glad he made it. And Wolf, he went further than that. This is what's kind of remarkable in what Jim Mattis said. He talked about President Trump as a leader, said he has immature judgment. Dividing the nation. A threat to the Constitution. Those are really powerful, powerful words.
Jim Mattis didn't want to come out. He didn't want to say anything publicly. He's been very tight-lipped about this since he left the job. But I for one am glad he spoke out. I think it's his responsibility as an American citizen and a former leader in the Armed Forces, as a retired officer, to speak out when the nation's in danger. And I think the nation was endangered by the provocative actions of President Trump.
BLITZER: General Wesley Clark, the former NATO Supreme Allied commander, as usual thanks so much for joining us. Thanks for everything you've done for our country. We appreciate it very much.
CLARK: Thank you, Wolf.
BLITZER: We'll continue to monitor the protest continuing across the country right now. They were sparked by the brutal killing of George Floyd. We have new details about the criminal case against the now former police officers. You're looking at live pictures coming in from Seattle, from Denver, elsewhere. Much more of our coverage right after this.
[21:35:57]
BLITZER: Looking at some live pictures coming in from New York right now. People, protesters are on the march right now in New York despite the fact that an hour and a half or so ago the curfew went into effect. I don't see many police officers trying to stop this. These protesters are clearly continuing the 12th night in a row.
Meanwhile, in North Carolina earlier in the day there was a private service for family and friends of George Floyd amidst so much public mourning. Today was a day for his loved ones to celebrate his life. The Reverend C. Davis Stackhouse led with a call for justice and love.

REV. C. DAVID STACKHOUSE, LEWIS CHAPEL MISSIONARY BAPTIST CHURCH: Like a mighty stream, let truth stand tall. Like the majestic oak, let hope be as broad as the distant horizon. Let lightness, let kindness rain like a summer shower. Let love explode in every heart. Let music soar and stir our feet to action and our spirits to praise. The lord is present in this sanctuary. Amen.

BLITZER: There will be a public viewing Monday in Houston, Texas, followed by a private ceremony on Tuesday. George Floyd's death is sparking a national reckoning on racial equality and how to hold police accountable. Earlier this week there were developments in the criminal case against the now ex-police officers involved in his death. Their lawyers previewed the police defense.
CNN legal analyst and criminal defense attorney Joey Jackson is joining us right now.
Joey, several of the officers involved now seem to be citing inexperience as a reason why they should not go to jail. What do you make of that potential defense?
JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Good luck. Wolf, good to be with you. Look, this is a very significant event that occurred. We know that from the showing of the protests. People obviously are mad as heck. They're not going to take it anymore. You see a diversity of protesters, not just African-Americans and people of color, but are joined by their white counterparts in unison that this was a disgrace. So you can use an experience to a point. Are you too inexperienced to know that if you have your foot on -- or excuse me, your knee on the neck of someone for an extended period of time that they will die? Are you too inexperienced to know that in the event that a person is saying I am going to die, crying for their mother, and telling you they can't breathe that they shouldn't be aided and assisted in some regard?
And so you can argue inexperience. You can argue youth. You can argue the time on the force that you had was inadequate. At the end of the day the prosecution is going to argue you are a sworn officer, you had a duty, you knew better, you failed, you contributed to his death as a result of your activity and therefore the prosecution will say you're guilty. That dog will not hunt.
BLITZER: The Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison told me this week when I interviewed him here in THE SITUATION ROOM that it will be difficult to convict police officers. He says he has a very strong case but there are always problems. What do you think?
JACKSON: I do believe that that is the case. And let's talk about why, Wolf. On the one hand you have an attitudinal issue. And what is that? I think people want to side with and believe the police. People do believe in general the police are there to protect and to serve them.
And so, you know, it's a rare occasion that police even are arrested much less indicted much less convicted. You can look at Eric Garner, ""I can't breathe,"" in New York in Staten Island. No indictments in that case.
You can look at Philando Castile, a traffic stop. Yes, the officer was indicted but he was acquitted at trial. So you're dealing with those attitudes. In addition to that you're dealing with the standard of prove, which is beyond a reasonable doubt and unanimous. Right? You have 12 jurors that have to agree. If there's one, then you know what, you have a problem. More than that, though, I think you're going to hear arguments from the other parties that were there, the police officers, concerning what their role was.
[21:40:01]
And they're going to make arguments to the extent that they were not aware of the severity, they perhaps didn't hear that George Floyd was saying he couldn't breathe or crying for his mother. They were not involved with regard to having the knee themselves on the neck.
You'll hear those arguments. And so to that extent, you know, you could perhaps convey or convince some jurors. I think at the end of the day, though, I think the prosecution does have, notwithstanding those challenges, Wolf, a compelling case to make.
BLITZER: Joey Jackson, helping us better appreciate the legal aspects of all of this as he always does. Thank you very much.
Meanwhile, we're looking at these live pictures coming in as these protests across the country are continuing this hour. It's easy to forget that we are also still very much in the middle of a pandemic. And because of that, these massive gatherings are worrying doctors.
We'll update you on that when we come back.
BLITZER: So we've seen massive crowds turn out over the past 12 days in protests around the country.
[21:45:02]
All this as we're still very much in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. And with thousands gathering, so many unfortunately not wearing masks, health experts are deeply worried that these protests potentially could spark some new hot spots.
Joining us now is the epidemiologist, the former Detroit health commissioner, Dr. Abdul El-Sayed.
Dr. El-Sayed, thanks so much for joining us.
So we're seeing the number of coronavirus cases here in the United States continue to rise. We're approaching two million confirmed cases, approaching 110,000 confirmed deaths in the United States over the past three months alone. Are you worried about potentially, and we hope it doesn't happen, a new spike in the wake of all of these protests?
DR. ABDUL EL-SAYED, EPIDEMIOLOGIST: Honestly, I am worried about a new spike. But I was worried about this new spike well before there were protests. And I will say that it's easy for us to assume that the most visual gathering of people is the reason why COVID-19 might spread. But I have to remind folks that this was a challenge, a worry that epidemiologists had well before this happened.
And also that it's those small interactions that people are having all the time as we start to open back up that of course we were attributing the potential for a second spike to come from. So I don't want folks to think that we're pitting public health against the protests because of course we know that in excess 83,000 black Americans die every year because of racism, and that itself is also a public health issue.
BLITZER: It certainly is. I was showing our viewers, Dr. El-Sayed, the live pictures from Los Angeles where there's a very large demonstration under way. I had a chance to speak just a couple of days ago with the mayor of Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti, and we spoke about the worries that he has about some potential new spike. Listen to this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI (D), LOS ANGELES, CA: It absolutely is a concern. And thank you for bringing that up, Wolf. We don't have to choose between spreading the coronavirus and having our voices heard. Practicing physical distancing, wearing face masks, washing our hands, or bringing hand sanitizer out there. It's absolutely critical. (END VIDEO CLIP)
BLITZER: What advice do you have for the protesters out there? Because we see them pretty close to each other. A lot of loud noise. And many of them unfortunately not wearing the face masks.
EL-SAYED: That's right. I was actually out there in Detroit just yesterday. And I'll say a couple of things. Number one, make sure you wear your face mask. Number two, if you can avoid yelling, it's better because of course droplets come out of the mouth when you yell. Bring something else to make noise or bring a sign that's big and visual. Number three, if you can, keep in a tight group rather than intermixing with the entire group to limit the potential exposure. And then number four, of course to the authorities, right? Be careful.
Anything that irritates people is going to cause those droplets to come out. And keeping people tightly held in a cell or in a jail or in a van can be really dangerous, too. So it's not just protesters themselves but it's also authorities who have a responsibility here to keep this safe, to keep this peaceful.
BLITZER: When you get home, don't just wash your hands. Probably take a shower. And put the clothes in the washer as well. That's the advice I've heard from other epidemiologists at the same time.
Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, thanks so much as usual for joining us. That's why I wanted you to give our viewers that very, very important medical advice. Appreciate it very much.
EL-SAYED: That's great advice, Wolf, and my privilege. Thank you.
BLITZER: Thank you.
As these nationwide protests surpass now a 12th straight day take a look at this. We have some live pictures coming in from Washington, D.C. A lot of people are still out on the streets.
[21:52:57]
BLITZER: The protests for social justice and against excessive use of police force are resonating not just here in the United States but also in Europe indeed around the world. There have been marches and rallies in numerous cities.
Our Nic Robertson in London and Melissa Bell in Paris. They have more now on what's going on in their corners of the globe.
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Wolf, thousands of people came to Central London to protest. They gathered first outside the Houses of Parliament, Parliament Green, absolutely filling it up. No social distancing. The message very clear in support of justice for George Floyd, in support Black Lives Matter.
The young people we spoke to there told us for some of them this was the first time they've come out and protest. The reason that they've done it because they've seen this effect rippling out across the world and then they marched a mile and a half to here to the U.S. embassy so that they can show what they hope was the United States, their dissatisfaction, displeasure, but the underlying message here to the United Kingdom as well. There is racism here and they want that dealt with -- Wolf.
MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, here in Paris, they've marched again. Several thousand people turned out despite this demonstration being illegal once again to fight against racism, against the injustice of police brutality. I think it's with impunity that people say all too often these allegations of wrongdoing by police across the Atlantic on this side as well.
And so this is not the first demonstration we've seen. Several thousand people turning up this afternoon in Paris but also in other French cities. We saw earlier demonstrations in Paris, very much focused on the similar case in France, that of Adama Traore, a young man who nearly four years ago, Wolf, was also killed just after being taken into police custody. You'll see his names on those signs quite a lot but also the very same words we're seeing in the United States, Black Lives Matter and no justice, no peace.
You really sense that this is a movement that has been given inspiration by events on the other side of the Atlantic -- Wolf.
BLITZER: Melissa Bell and Nic Robertson, guys, thanks very much.
[21:55:01]
