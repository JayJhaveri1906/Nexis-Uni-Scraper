From California to Pennsylvania, governors and mayors across the U.S. are ratcheting up COVID-19 restrictions amid the record-shattering resurgence of the virus that is all but certain to get worse because of holiday travel and family gatherings over Thanksgiving.
Leaders are closing businesses or curtailing hours and other operations, and they are ordering or imploring people to stay home and keep their distance from others to help stem a rising tide of infections that threatens to overwhelm the health care system.

The move closes many nonessential indoor businesses and requires the wearing of masks outside homes, with limited exceptions.
The tightening came as Moderna Inc. announced that its experimental coronavirus vaccine appears to be over 94% effective, based on early results. A week ago Pfizer disclosed similar findings with its own formula.

2nd virus vaccine shows striking success in US tests
A second experimental COVID-19 vaccine — this one from Moderna Inc. — yielded extraordinarily strong early results Monday, another badly needed dose of hope as the pandemic enters a terrible new phase.
Moderna said its vaccine appears to be 94.5% effective, according to preliminary data from an ongoing study. A week ago, competitor Pfizer Inc. announced its own vaccine looked 90% effective — news that puts both companies on track to seek permission within weeks for emergency use in the U.S.
The results are “truly striking,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government's top infectious-diseases expert. “The vaccines that we're talking about, and vaccines to come, are really the light at the end of the tunnel.”
A vaccine can’t come fast enough, as virus cases topped 11 million in the U.S. over the weekend — 1 million of them recorded in just the past week — and governors and mayors are ratcheting up restrictions ahead of Thanksgiving. The outbreak has killed more than 1.3 million people worldwide, over 246,000 of them in the U.S.
Stocks rallied on Wall Street and around the world on rising hopes that the global economy could start returning to normal in the coming months. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained more than 470 points, or 1.6%, to close at a record high of over 29,950. Moderna stock was up almost 10%.

Trump to order troop reductions in Afghanistan, Iraq
The Trump administration is expected to cut the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan almost in half to 2,500 by Jan. 15, U.S. officials said Monday. The order would stop short of outgoing President Donald Trump’s goal to have all troops withdrawn by the end of the year, which had faced opposition from military and diplomatic advisers.
The Pentagon also expects to cut the number of troops in Iraq to 2,500, a reduction of more than 500. The decisions come as no surprise, following Trump’s shakeup of the Pentagon leadership last week in which he installed loyalists who share his frustration with the continued troop presence in the war zones. The cuts give Trump an accomplishment in his final weeks in office even as he refuses to concede his election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.
The officials said military leaders were told over the weekend about the planned withdrawals and an executive order is in the works but has not yet been delivered to commanders. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. There are between 4,500-5,000 troops in Afghanistan now, and more than 3,000 in Iraq.
Under the planned order, the troop cuts would be completed just five days before Biden takes office, leaving him with a smaller military footprint in the two key war zones. Military commanders have expressed less concern about pulling more troops from Iraq, where the Iraqi forces are better able to maintain their nation's security.
Trump's new Pentagon chief, Christopher Miller, hinted at the troop withdrawals over the weekend in a carefully worded message to the force that suggested compromise.

'More people may die': Biden urges Trump to aid transition
WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — President-elect Joe Biden on Monday warned of dire consequences if President Donald Trump and his administration continue to refuse to coordinate with his transition team on the coronavirus pandemic and block briefings on national security, policy issues and vaccine plans.
The remarks marked Biden's toughest comments to date on Trump's failure to acknowledge his election loss and cooperate with the incoming administration for a peaceful transfer of power.
“More people may die if we don’t coordinate,” Biden told reporters during a news conference in Wilmington, Delaware.
Biden and his aides have emphasized the importance of being briefed on White House efforts to control the pandemic and distribute prospective vaccines. The Trump administration is working on its own distribution plan, while Biden’s chief of staff indicated his transition team will proceed with their own planning separately because of the obstruction.
Biden called the vaccine distribution a “huge, huge undertaking,” and said that if his team has to wait until he takes office to dig into the government’s distribution plan, they’ll be “behind, over a month, month and a half.”

Pandemic politics leave DC in gridlock as virus surges
WASHINGTON (AP) — With the nation gripped by a resurgent coronavirus and looking to Washington for help, President Donald Trump and lawmakers in Congress have a message for struggling Americans: Just keep waiting.
The urgency of the nationwide surge in virus cases, spiking hospitalizations and increasing death tolls has hardly resonated in the nation’s capital as its leaders are vexed by transition politics and trying to capitalize on the promise of a coming vaccine. The virus has killed more than 246,000 Americans this year and infected at least 11.1 million — some 1 million of them in just the past week.
Yet in Congress, where talks over economic relief bills stalled out months ago, lame-duck approval of aid is hardly front-of-mind. Across town at the White House, Trump is more focused on getting credit for the vaccine development push and blocking President-elect Joe Biden from getting the information needed to ensure the new administration can smoothly take over the fight against the pandemic.
“Another Vaccine just announced,” Trump tweeted Monday morning after Moderna announced that its candidate appeared in early testing to be 95% effective against the virus. “For those great ‘historians’, please remember that these great discoveries, which will end the China Plague, all took place on my watch!”
On a call Monday with governors, Vice President Mike Pence, who heads the White House coronavirus task force, struck a rosy tone and asked states to give their residents comfort that vaccines are coming and that “America and your state has never been more prepared.”

Hate crimes in US reach highest level in more than a decade
WASHINGTON (AP) — Hate crimes in the U.S. rose to the highest level in more than a decade as federal officials also recorded the highest number of hate-motivated killings since the FBI began collecting that data in the early 1990s, according to an FBI report released Monday.
There were 51 hate crime murders in 2019, which includes 22 people who were killed in a shooting that targeted Mexicans at a Walmart in the border city of El Paso, Texas, the report said. The suspect in that August 2019 shooting, which left two dozen other people injured, was charged with both state and federal crimes in what authorities said was an attempt to scare Hispanics into leaving the United States.
There were 7,314 hate crimes last year, up from 7,120 the year before — and approaching the 7,783 of 2008. The FBI’s annual report defines hate crimes as those motivated by bias based on a person’s race, religion or sexual orientation, among other categories.
Some of the 2019 increases may be the result of better reporting by police departments, but law enforcement officials and advocacy groups don’t doubt that hate crimes are on the rise. The Justice Department has for years been specifically prioritizing hate crime prosecutions.
The data also shows there was a nearly 7% increase in religion-based hate crimes, with 953 reports of crimes targeting Jews and Jewish institutions last year, up from 835 the year before. The FBI said the number of hate crimes against African Americans dropped slightly to 1,930, from 1,943.

Hurricane Iota now a Category 5 storm near Central America
MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) — Hurricane Iota rapidly strengthened Monday into a Category 5 storm that is likely to bring catastrophic damage to the same part of Central America already battered by a powerful Hurricane Eta less than two weeks ago.
Iota has intensified over the western Caribbean on approach to Nicaragua and Honduras. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said the storm had maximum sustained winds of 160 mph (260 kph). It was centered about 55 miles (90 kilometers) east-southeast of Puerto Cabezas, also known as Bilwi, Nicaragua and moving westward at 9 mph (15 kph).
Authorities warned that Iota would probably come ashore over areas where Eta’s torrential rains saturated the soil, leaving it prone to new landslides and floods, and that the storm surge could reach a shocking 15 to 20 feet (4.5 to 6 meters) above normal tides.
That storm surge was on the mind of Yasmina Wriedt on Monday in Bilwi's El Muelle neighborhood, sitting tight against the sea.
“The situation doesn’t look good at all,” Wriedt said. “We woke up without electricity, with rain and the surf is getting really high.”

About 90K sex abuse claims filed in Boy Scouts bankruptcy
NEW YORK (AP) — Close to 90,000 sexual abuse claims have been filed against the Boy Scouts of America as the Monday deadline arrived for submitting claims in the organization’s bankruptcy case.
The number far exceeds the initial projections of lawyers across the United States who have been signing up clients since the Boy Scouts filed for bankruptcy protection in February in the face of hundreds of lawsuits alleging decades-old sex abuse by Scout leaders.
“We are devastated by the number of lives impacted by past abuse in Scouting and moved by the bravery of those who have come forward,” the Boy Scouts said in a statement. “We are heartbroken that we cannot undo their pain.”
A few hours before the 5 p.m. EST deadline, the number of claims totaled 88,500, lawyers said.
Eventually, the proceedings in federal bankruptcy court will lead to the creation of a compensation fund to pay out settlements to abuse survivors whose claims are upheld.

What does COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness mean?
It refers to the likelihood that a coronavirus shot will work in people.
Two vaccine makers have said that preliminary results from their late-stage studies suggest their experimental vaccines are strongly protective. Moderna this week said its vaccine appears nearly 95% effective. This comes on the heels of Pfizer's announcement that its shot appeared similarly effective.
Those numbers raised hopes around the world that vaccines could help put an end to the pandemic sometime next year if they continue to show that they prevent disease and are safe.
Effectiveness numbers will change as the vaccine studies continue since the early calculations were based on fewer than 100 COVID-19 cases in each study. But early results provide strong signals that the vaccine could prevent a majority of disease when large groups of people are vaccinated.

Americans across party lines, regions embrace marijuana
HELENA, Mont. (AP) — Bill Stocker could be considered the archetype of a conservative voter: He's a retired Marine and former police officer who voted for President Donald Trump. But he's also among the majority of South Dakota voters who broadly legalized marijuana this month.
Stocker, 61, said enforcing marijuana laws gets in the way of pursuing other drug crimes and called warnings about the ills of marijuana “a bunch of baloney"" that even people in a Republican stronghold like South Dakota no longer believe.
South Dakota's values of “personal responsibility and freedom” won out, said Stocker, who lives in Sioux Falls.
The 2020 election helped prove how broadly accepted marijuana has become throughout the United States, with measures to legalize recreational pot also breezing to victory in progressive New Jersey, moderate Arizona and conservative Montana. Fifteen states have now broadly legalized it, while 36 states allow medical marijuana.
Voters in Mississippi overwhelmingly approved medical marijuana this month, giving the drug another foothold in the South."

Ambassadors and other diplomats from the United States and other Western democracies called on Russia to protect the rights of all its citizens, including sexual minorities, as the world marked Global Pride Day 2020 on June 27.
In a statement by representatives from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States, the diplomats said they ""affirm the inherent dignity of each individual as expressed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and call upon the government of the Russian Federation to adhere to its stated commitment to protecting the rights of all citizens, including the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) community.""
They cited discrimination and violence against LGBTI communities around the world and condemned authorities turning ""a blind eye to the hate speech and hate crimes that are still prevalent in many countries.""
The joint statement (https://ru.usembassy.gov/joint-statement-on-pride-month-2020/) on Pride Month 2020 was posted on the U.S. Embassy in Moscow's website and other places.
The British and U.S. embassies in the Russian capital both flew rainbow flags, drawing criticism from Russia as a violation of a controversial law pushed by President Vladimir Putin and his allies against the public promotion of ""nontraditional"" lifestyles.
Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said when asked about the rainbow banners that ""any occurrence of propaganda of nontraditional sexual minorities in our country is prohibited by law.""
""This June, we celebrate Pride Month by applauding LGBTI activists and their allies, who are working to ensure that every individual, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity, receives the full protection of the law. Human rights are universal. Everyone is entitled to their full enjoyment,"" the Western diplomats' statement said.
Pride events on June 27 were severely curtailed in most places to avoid the risk of coronavirus infection but were going ahead in physical-distancing form in Berlin, Mexico City, New York City, and other major cities around the world.
A Russian media group linked to a close Putin associate produced an antigay political ad ahead of this week's ongoing Russian vote on constitutional amendments that, among other things, include a passage defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman to enshrine the country's ban on same-sex marriage in the constitution.
Aleksei Navalny, a popular opposition figure, tweeted that Russian officials appeared to ""have gone completely crazy"" on the antigay theme. (https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-lgbt-constitution-vote/30649260.html)
The constitutional changes are headlined by an amendment that would open the door for the former KGB lieutenant colonel to remain in power until 2036.

U.S. Representative Pramila Jayapal (WA-07) and nine city, county and state elected officials of color who represent the Seattle community sent a letter to Mayor Jenny Durkan and Police Chief Carmen Best today that urged them to enact meaningful and transformative changes to the very nature of policing throughout the city.
""We write as elected officials of color who represent various parts of the City of Seattle and are deeply committed to honoring the lives of the many Black brothers, sisters and siblings who have been killed by police violence and are currently experiencing the triple threats of a global pandemic, pervasive anti-Blackness and police violence,"" wrote Seattle's elected officials of color who serve at the local, county and state level.

It calls on Mayor Durkan and Chief Best to take three critical and timely actions:
First, immediately end law enforcement's violent response to ongoing demonstrations by ending the use of the National Guard; stopping the use of all forms of chemical substances for crowd control; ending the use of rubber bullets and flash-bangs; and demilitarizing police on the streets who interact with protestors.
Second, completely rethink policing to create a model for public safety that truly upholds the safety of all communities and redirect law enforcement spending and investing into essential services.
Third, immediately institute serious accountability and transparency measures into police contracts.
The elected officials' full letter is here.
The letter comes just hours after Representative Jayapal helped to introduce the Justice in Policing Act, federal legislation that would implement long overdue police accountability and reform measures by establishing a federal police misconduct registry, making lynching a federal hate crime, ending qualified immunity, requiring reporting of all incidents of use of force to the Justice Department, banning chokeholds and no-knock warrants for drug cases, restricting the transfer of military equipment to local police and increasing accountability, oversight and transparency. The New York Times has described this new legislation as ""the most aggressive intervention into policing by Congress in recent memory.""

Donald Trump's tweet the week before last that the 75-year old man who was shoved to the ground by police in Buffalo and wound up in the intensive care unit ""could be an ANTIFA provocateur"" was just one latest example of Trump's use of language to demonize others. 
His call a week earlier that ""when the looting starts the shooting starts"" not merely glorifies violence, as Twitter noted. It predictably creates conditions that lead to violence. 
It is all part of a predictable pattern. I am a communication and leadership professor and have spent the last 18 months carefully studying Trump's language in preparing for a forthcoming book. I have documented 12 kinds of communication that have historically preceded acts of violence against groups, critics or rivals - and that have led to civil unrest. Trump uses all 12 forms. These include: 
Dehumanizing a group: He dehumanizes groups: Mexicans, Muslims, migrants. He calls them animals and says their presence among us is an ""infestation.""
Demonizing a rival or critic: He tells four congresswomen of color to go back to where they came from; all are American citizens, and three were born in this country. He says those congresswomen are not capable of loving America. He refutes the legitimacy of a sitting president, and says the speaker of the House wants terrorists, drug kingpins and human traffickers to enter the country to wreak havoc.
Severely exaggerating risk: He inflates a relatively harmless event - a scraggly group of impoverished migrants walking thousands of miles to seek legal asylum - and calls it a ""caravan"" or an ""invasion,"" funded by mysterious sources, infiltrated by dangerous people, worthy of mobilizing the military.
Trump's call for mobilizing the active duty military to respond to civil unrest is an escalation of this third form of language that provokes violence.
The U.S. Holocaust Museum Simon-Skjodt Center for the Prevention of Genocide defines ""dangerous speech"" as speech that, under the right conditions, can influence people to accept, condone and commit violence against members of a group. Trump's language has that effect. 
After Trump began his presidential campaign in 2015 by calling Mexicans rapists, drug dealers and the cause of many American problems including crime, hate crimes against people perceived to be Latino surged. 
After he called for a ""total and complete ban of Muslims entering the United States,"" hate crimes against people perceived to be Muslim or Arab surged.
As he persisted, earlier this year, in calling COVID-19 the ""China virus,"" hate crimes against people perceived to be Asian surged.
And as he was allowed to get away with it, Trump escalated his rhetoric. He began, pre-campaign, conditionally: If Barack Obama wasn't born in this country, he could not be president. It moved to the outright declarative: He asserted, falsely, that Rep. Ilhan Omar has praised al-Qaida. In fact, she has denounced them her entire career
A few weeks ago, he escalated further: He retweeted a video of the head of Cowboys for Trump, who happens to be an elected official, saying ""The only good Democrat is a dead Democrat.""
With his escalation of language, the violence also escalated. During the campaign it took the form mostly of hate crimes. 
But all that changed in the run up to the 2018 midterm elections, when it provoked acts and attempted acts of terrorism.
In early October 2018, Trump was using some form of ""invader,"" invasion,"" ""criminal,"" ""animal"" or ""killer"" between eight and 10 times per rally. By late October it had escalated to more than 30 times. These were further amplified by his tweets. His words were then amplified further in the media and social media, and then took off in the white supremacist ecosystem that became an echo chamber. 
He said that George Soros was funding the ""caravan"" that constituted an ""invasion"" at the border. Within two days, more than 2 million Twitter accounts reaching 275 million people mentioned both Soros and ""caravan"" together. So did Facebook accounts reaching 99 million. 
That same week, in late October 2018, the Tree of Life synagogue shooter committed an act of terror in Pittsburgh, killing 11 people and wounding two. Six days before the shooting he posted, ""I have noticed a change in people saying 'illegals' that now say 'invaders.' I like this."" He took up the Soros conspiracy, and he named synagogues that he said were funding a refugee agency that was involved in the ""invasion."" Two hours before the shooting, he posted that this agency ""likes to bring invaders that kill our people. I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw the optics. I'm going in.""
That same week a Trump supporter sent a mail bomb to Soros' home, and other bombs to a dozen Trump critics. The New Zealand mosque shooter and the El Paso Walmart shooter both invoked Trump and invasions in their manifestos. 
So what can engaged citizens, civic leaders, journalists and public officials do?
First, they need to see the pattern and to name it.
Second, they need to name the foreseeable consequences of such language: It creates the very social conditions that can lead people to accept, condone and commit violence against members of a group, a rival or a critic.
Third, they need to unambiguously call on Trump, or any other leader who uses such language, to stop. And to make clear that they hold that leader accountable for the violent consequences of such language.
We saw just this when former Defense Secretary James Mattis, a retired Marine Corps general, finally broke his silence. Speaking of his successor, current Defense Secretary Mark Esper, Mattis said, ""We must reject any thinking of our cities as a 'battlespace' that our uniformed military is called upon to 'dominate.'""
Speaking of the president, Mattis said, ""Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people - does not even pretend to try. Instead he tries to divide us. We are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort. We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership.""
Gen. Mattis has shown us the way. Now it's up to the rest of us."

PRESIDENT-ELECT JOE BIDEN: More people may die if we don`t coordinate.
NIKOLE KILLION: President Trump`s refusal to engage on the pandemic is angering governors from both parties who are seeing cases rise to record levels.
LARRY HOGAN: We`re in the middle of a war. And we don`t know who the general is going to be.
NIKOLE KILLION: Some governors fighting the virus are even under fire from the administration. Doctor Scott Atlas, a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, told people to rise up after Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer issued new COVID restrictions in the state.
PRESIDENT-ELECT JOE BIDEN: The idea that the President`s now existing, remaining ad-- advisor on COVID is saying that they should resist. What the hell is the matter with these guys?
NIKOLE KILLION: Meanwhile, President Trump refuses to concede, tweeting an acknowledgment yesterday that Biden had won, but then claim he had won.
How did you interpret that?
PRESIDENT-ELECT JOE BIDEN: I interpret that as Trumpism. No change in his modus operandi.
NIKOLE KILLION: Biden`s former partner in the White House told Scott Pelley on 60 MINUTES that Mister Trump needed to think beyond his own ego and concede.
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA (60 MINUTES): My advice to President Trump is, if you want at this late stage in the game to be remembered as somebody who put count-- country first, it`s time for you to do the same thing.
NIKOLE KILLION: The former President also compared Mister Trump to Richie Rich, calling him "".the complaining, lying, doesn`t-take-responsibility- for-anything type of figure."" Former First Lady Michelle Obama also weighed in, writing that she warmly welcomed Melania Trump to the White House during the 2016 transition despite being angry at Donald Trump for spreading "".racist lies about my husband that had put my family in danger."" Mister Trump`s national security adviser became the highest-ranking official to acknowledge Mister Biden publicly as the next President.
ROBERT O`BRIEN: If the Biden-Harris ticket is determined to be the winner and-- and-- it`s-- you know, obviously things look that way now, we`ll have a very professional transition from the National Security Council. There`s no question about it.
NIKOLE KILLION: And there`s a stunning allegation in the Georgia recount. The state`s top election official says he is coming under increasing pressure by some Republicans, including South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham to throw away legal absentee ballots to reverse President Trump`s loss in the state. Graham said that`s ridiculous, but did confirm he asked how ballots are verified.

ANNE-MARIE GREEN: Well, ahead on CBS THIS MORNING, we speak with the Georgia`s Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger about the pressure that he is facing from his own party to exclude legally cast votes.
President Trump is reportedly expected to order troop reductions in Afghanistan and Iraq. News outlets cite U.S. officials who say the plan would leave twenty-five hundred troops in both countries. Right now, there are up to five thousand troops in Afghanistan and more than three thousand in Iraq. Republican leaders are warning about making a rush exit from Afghanistan. They say it could jeopardize the peace process and undermine counterterrorism efforts.
A powerful Hurricane Iota made landfall overnight in northeastern Nicaragua. The storm hit as a Category 4, packing a hundred-and-fifty-five- mile-- mile-per-hour winds and torrential rain.

Today is Sunday, June 21, the 173rd day of 2020. There are 193 days left in the year.
Today's Highlight in History:
On June 21, 1989, a sharply divided Supreme Court ruled that burning the American flag as a form of political protest was protected by the First Amendment.
On this date:
In 1788, the United States Constitution went into effect as New Hampshire became the ninth state to ratify it.
In 1834, Cyrus Hall McCormick received a patent for his reaping machine.
In 1913, Georgia ""Tiny"" Broadwick became the first woman to parachute from an airplane as she jumped over Los Angeles.
In 1942, an Imperial Japanese submarine fired shells at Fort Stevens on the Oregon coast, causing little damage.
In 1954, the American Cancer Society presented a study to the American Medical Association meeting in San Francisco which found that men who regularly smoked cigarettes died at a considerably higher rate than non-smokers.
In 1964, civil rights workers Michael H. Schwerner, Andrew Goodman and James E. Chaney were slain in Philadelphia, Mississippi; their bodies were found buried in an earthen dam six weeks later. (Forty-one years later on this date in 2005, Edgar Ray Killen, an 80-year-old former Ku Klux Klansman, was found guilty of manslaughter; he was sentenced to 60 years in prison, where he died in January 2018.)
In 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court, in Miller v. California, ruled that states may ban materials found to be obscene according to local standards.
In 1982, a jury in Washington, D.C. found John Hinckley Jr. not guilty by reason of insanity in the shootings of President Ronald Reagan and three other men.
In 1997, the WNBA made its debut as the New York Liberty defeated the host Los Angeles Sparks 67-57.
In 2001, a federal grand jury in Alexandria, Va., indicted 13 Saudis and a Lebanese in absentia for the 1996 bombing of the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia that killed 19 American servicemen. Death claimed actor Carroll O'Connor at age 76 and blues musician John Lee Hooker at age 80.
In 2002, one of the worst wildfires in Arizona history grew to 128,000 acres, forcing thousands of homeowners near the community of Show Low to flee.
In 2013, President Barack Obama nominated James Comey, a Bush-era Justice official, to head the FBI, succeeding Robert Mueller. The Food Network said it was dropping Paula Deen, barely an hour after the celebrity cook posted the first of two videotaped apologies begging forgiveness from fans and critics troubled by her admission to having used racial slurs in the past.
Ten years ago: Faisal Shahzad (FY'-sul shah-ZAHD'), a Pakistan-born U.S. citizen, pleaded guilty to charges of plotting a failed car bombing in New York's Times Square. (Shahzad was later sentenced to life in prison.)
Five years ago: Four days after it welcomed a young stranger (Dylann Roof) who sat for prayer and then opened fire, killing nine people, the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in South Carolina held its first worship service with themes of love and healing, plus a note of defiance. (Roof is on federal death row, the first person to be ordered executed for a federal hate crime; he received nine life sentences in exchange for a guilty plea in state court.) Jordan Spieth became the sixth player to win the Masters and the U.S. Open after Dustin Johnson three-putted from 12 feet on the final hole at Chambers Bay with a chance to win the championship himself.
One year ago: A skydiving plane became inverted and crashed shortly after takeoff from the Hawaiian island of Oahu, killing all 11 people on board; it was the deadliest civil aviation accident since 2011. Seven motorcyclists were killed when a pickup truck hauling a trailer collided with 10 motorcycles on a rural highway in New Hampshire. (The truck driver, Volodymyr Zhukovskyy, is awaiting trial; he was indicted on 23 charges, including charges that he was under the influence of one or more drugs at the time.) The Rolling Stones launched their delayed North American tour at Chicago’s Soldier Field; 75-year-old Mick Jagger showed no sign of ill health three months after doctors said he needed medical treatment.

Donald Trump's tweet the week before last that the 75-year old man who was shoved to the ground by police in Buffalo and wound up in the intensive care unit ""could be an ANTIFA provocateur"" was just one latest example of Trump's use of language to demonize others. 
His call a week earlier that ""when the looting starts the shooting starts"" not merely glorifies violence, as Twitter noted. It predictably creates conditions that lead to violence. 
It is all part of a predictable pattern. I am a communication and leadership professor and have spent the last 18 months carefully studying Trump's language in preparing for a forthcoming book. I have documented 12 kinds of communication that have historically preceded acts of violence against groups, critics or rivals - and that have led to civil unrest. Trump uses all 12 forms. These include: 
Dehumanizing a group: He dehumanizes groups: Mexicans, Muslims, migrants. He calls them animals and says their presence among us is an ""infestation.""
Demonizing a rival or critic: He tells four congresswomen of color to go back to where they came from; all are American citizens, and three were born in this country. He says those congresswomen are not capable of loving America. He refutes the legitimacy of a sitting president, and says the speaker of the House wants terrorists, drug kingpins and human traffickers to enter the country to wreak havoc.
Severely exaggerating risk: He inflates a relatively harmless event - a scraggly group of impoverished migrants walking thousands of miles to seek legal asylum - and calls it a ""caravan"" or an ""invasion,"" funded by mysterious sources, infiltrated by dangerous people, worthy of mobilizing the military.

NEW YORK, July 13, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- As the number of hate groups in the US and Europe rose to its highest in 20 years, White supremacist groups have once again risen to mainstream politics and have garnered the attention of anti-money laundering (AML) and Counter Financing of Terrorism (CFT) agencies. Continue Reading
Cobwebs Technologies Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, agencies involved in Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) have focused their efforts against Islamic extremist groups. But in recent years, a rise in White Supremacist Extremist (WSE)-related violence has triggered a new focus, with concerns mounting as to how these increasingly organized groups exploit financial institutions to raise funds.In April 2020, the US designated a Russian far-right group-Russian Imperial Movement (RIM) as a foreign terrorist organization, blocking the group's leaders and any assets from the United States. 
It marks the first time that a far-right group has been given the terrorist-group label by the US.While RIM is based in Russia, it has fought alongside Russian mercenaries in Syria and Libya, carried out deadly attacks in Europe, and has provided advanced military training and indoctrination to Neo-Nazis from across the world, including the United States.Though they were the first transnational white supremacist group to obtain such a designation usually saved for Jihadist groups, it is expected that more will follow after the White House added white nationalism as a threat to the government's National Strategy for Counter-terrorism in 2018.""These developments add another layer of complexity in the already dynamic and unpredictable sanctions environment, for institutions around the world that seek to comply with US sanctions,"" said Daniel Nisman , Head of Financial Sector Solutions at Cobwebs Technologies .""What's more, recent political trends spotlighting hate crimes and activity have made it even more imperative for financial institutions to ensure that they disassociate themselves from any interaction with such groups; lest they risk severe reputational damage.""What has been lacking, however, are solutions and methodologies that banks and other financial institutions can use to identify hate-financing threats, particularly as basic screening solutions are not calibrated to identify activity that could associate a client with a designated or non-designated hate group.By infusing artificial intelligence to Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) intelligence gathering, Cobwebs' new Weaver Financial Investigations platform is able to map the seemingly-legitimate business activities of designated hate groups and their following instantly, providing Bank compliance teams with a full local risk picture of potential risks among their client base. The technology also allows for enhanced screening according to dynamic criteria related to potentially risky activity among new and existing clients in a manner that enables bankers to apply a risk-based vetting approach to new customers and comply with CFT regulations.In June 2020, the company held a major online training session for hundreds of bankers across Europe and the US, providing background into hate-financing and technology-based methodologies that can be used to keep hate financiers away and comply with the Bank Secrecy Act and the European Money Laundering Directives.""In theory, no institution wants to be associated with violent hate groups,"" explained Nisman, ""but implementing effective checks according to a coherent organizational policy poses significant dilemmas on a political, data-protection, and general risk perspective.

""We in the Muslim World League are proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with our Jewish brothers and sisters to build understanding, respect, love and interreligious harmony,"" said Issa from Mecca in a virtual conference organized by the Combat Anti-Semitism Movement and the American Sephardi Federation.
He said that Jews and Muslims need to work together to rebuild ties and create ""bridges of dialogue"" between their communities. ""Whereas Jews and Muslims lived centuries together, in these last decades we have sadly grown apart,"" Issa said. ""Now, we must rebuild the bridges of dialogue and the bonds of partnership between our communities... Since taking over the Muslim World League, it has been my mission to fight the forces of hatred and violence.""
Earlier this year, Issa visited the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp, where he said, he ""stood united alongside my Jewish brothers and said: never again. Not for Jews, not for Muslims, not for Christians, not for Hindus, not for Sikhs. Not for any of God's children. History's greatest horror, the Holocaust, must never be repeated.""
Additional speakers at the event included Elan Carr (US Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism), Sam Brownback (US Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom) and Ahmed Shaheed (UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Belief and Religion). During the event, Issa was honored with an inaugural award for his contribution toward fighting antisemitism.
Issa condemned hate crimes across the world, including the spate of recent attacks against Jews. ""Your community has tragically been the target of several terrorist attacks,"" he said. ""In Pittsburgh; in San Diego; in Munsey, New York; in Halle, Germany. I condemned each and every one of these horrible assaults upon humanity. As if they were attacks on Muslims.""
Sacha Roytman Dratwa, director of the Combat Anti-Semitism Movement, said that the way to defeat antisemitism is by working together.
""At a time when Iran's spiritual leader calls for the destruction of the Jewish state, the Sheikh's statements condemning the hatred of Jews are of particular importance, especially given the scrutiny he often faces,"" Roytman Dratwa said.
Combat Anti-Semitism is a non-partisan grassroots movement of individuals and organizations, across religions and faiths that works to ending antisemitism in all its forms.

And a film about the band the Go-Go’s airs on Showtime.
What’s on TV
YUSUF HAWKINS: STORM OVER BROOKLYN (2020) 9 p.m. on HBO. Thirty-one years ago this month, Yusuf Hawkins was killed in the Bensonhurst neighborhood of Brooklyn, in what became one of the city’s most notorious hate crimes and a sign of its racial divisions in the 1980s and ’90s. This documentary revisits the case — in which Hawkins, a Black teenager, was pursued by a mob of white youths, then shot — through archival footage and interviews with Hawkins’s family. Also interviewed are public figures like the Rev. Al Sharpton, who led protests after the killing and helped turn the case into an argument for change. “I don’t know who shot Yusuf,” Sharpton said at Hawkins’s funeral in 1989, “but the system loaded the gun.”
THE GO-GO’S (2020) 7:20 p.m. on Showtime. Early in this documentary about the band the Go-Go’s, the guitarist Jane Wiedlin describes her submersion into the Los Angeles punk scene of the 1970s. “People used to cross the street when they saw me,” she says. “I felt powerful for the first time.” By taking the D.I.Y. grit of that Los Angeles scene and finishing it with a pop sheen, the Go-Go’s rose to history-making levels of success. Their debut album, “Beauty and the Beat,” released in 1981, was the first record by an all-female group whose members wrote its songs and played their own instruments to hit No. 1 on the Billboard album chart. In the documentary, which debuted earlier this month, the director Alison Ellwood revisits the band’s punk roots, its rise to fame and the tensions that followed.
What’s Streaming
MUPPETS NOW Stream on Disney+. Jim Henson’s furry brainchildren get a jolt of internet energy — in more ways than one — in this new streaming series, in which Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy and company perform sketches that spoof online video formats. The show is the latest attempt to modernize the Muppets after “The Muppets,” an ABC sitcom with the characters, struggled to recapture viewers’ hearts in 2015. This new show may have better luck. “‘Muppets Now’ improves on the ABC sitcom because it understands what the Muppets are and why we love them,” James Poniewozik wrote in a recent article in The New York Times. “They’re not mopey stand-ins for us but wild, demonic imaginings of ourselves, unburdened by impulse control and the laws of physics.”
ABOMINABLE (2019) Stream on Hulu; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. If you or your children prefer your cute creatures computer-animated, skip Kermit and consider this movie instead. A creation of DreamWorks Animation and the Chinese production company Pearl Studio, written and directed by Jill Culton, “Abominable” tells the story of Yi, a girl (voiced by Chloe Bennet) who goes on a journey with a magical yeti named Everest. It is, Glenn Kenny wrote in his review for The Times, “an exceptionally watchable and amiable animated tale.”

14,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1001/Files (250).DOCX","The New York Times",2020-07-30,"2129 words","Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 15","By Brian M. Rosenthal and Patricia Mazzei",NA,"She Carried a Badge. Now, Will It Carry Her?",FALSE,"An Orlando police officer shoved a 27-year-old Hispanic woman down a flight of stairs, breaking her ankle. A jury ordered him to pay her medical bills.
Another officer slammed an 84-year-old World War II veteran to the ground during a car-towing dispute, resulting in doctors' putting him into a medically induced coma. The city had to pay him $880,000. 
 Outside a Target store, officers investigating a robbery surrounded a minivan and fired into it nearly a dozen times, critically injuring an unarmed man. He won a $750,000 settlement.
 The episodes all occurred between 2007 and 2010, long before the ongoing protests currently sweeping the country, denouncing the disproportionate use of police force against people of color. If the Orlando police felt even a fraction of the pressure that departments face today, the leadership did not bend to it: The chief, Val B. Demings, defended the officers in each case.
 A decade later, Ms. Demings, now a second-term Democratic congresswoman, has emerged as a finalist to be Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s running mate. She rose in politics as a Black woman with law enforcement credentials, but her moment in the spotlight comes as the nation reckons with the difficult legacy of police brutality and racial discrimination.
 If she is chosen as the vice-presidential nominee, her career could prove to be a political asset against an incumbent president who is building his re-election campaign around his call for law and order, while attacking Mr. Biden as weak on crime. But in the aftermath of the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, with protests continuing to rock the country, it could also be a political liability.
 ''This is an opportunity to change the way things are,'' said David Porter, a former newspaper columnist active in progressive causes, who worked for Ms. Demings early in her political career. ''I just don't know that picking a cop would send the right message right now.''
 Police misconduct cases are also the focus of renewed scrutiny for another top contender for the vice presidency, Senator Kamala Harris, who has been criticized for not aggressively prosecuting officers accused of wrongdoing as California's attorney general. And they derailed the hopes of another candidate, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who withdrew last month amid criticism that as a prosecutor she had failed to charge officers accused of misconduct.
 In recent weeks, Ms. Demings has become a leading voice calling for changes in policing, and she has cast herself as an experienced reformer, repeating that she started out as a social worker and brought a ''social worker's heart'' to police work. But a review by The New York Times shows a more complicated record: that of a police leader with a long history of defending the status quo.
 Ms. Demings, 63, spent 27 years in one of the most violent police departments of its size in the United States. She repeatedly defended fellow officers, dating at least to 1999, when she helped vindicate a white chief in a neighboring city of allegations of racial discrimination. During her time as chief, crime sharply declined, but police use of force remained high; a 2015 study by The Orlando Sentinel showed that in the second half of Ms. Demings's tenure and during the tenure of her successor, officers used force at a rate that was twice as high as those of officers at other departments of similar size.
 While she was chief, her department also began arresting people for violating a years-old ban on distributing food to homeless residents in city parks.
 And in Congress, Ms. Demings is one of the only Democrats to co-sponsor the Protect and Serve Act, which would make it a hate crime to attack a law enforcement officer.
 In an interview this week, Ms. Demings stood by her record on police accountability, saying she improved hiring practices and increased officer training. But she said her top priority as chief was addressing a spike in crime.
 ''Police work is not a perfect science,'' she said. ''We're there to clean up messes. And sometimes when you clean up messes, it's not pretty.''
 Supporters said Ms. Demings should not be judged for all the flaws of policing in America.
 ''You can't blame Val for institutional racism,'' said Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the highest-ranking African-American in Congress.
 Mr. Clyburn, who has not endorsed anyone to be Mr. Biden's running mate, is one of many Democrats who believe Ms. Demings could bring a lot to the ticket.
 She rose from humble roots to become Orlando's first female chief and a House manager in Mr. Trump's impeachment trial this year. Her supporters believe she could appeal to enough independents, and perhaps even Republicans, to improve Mr. Biden's prospects in Florida, a battleground state where major elections are routinely decided by razor-thin margins.
 Mr. Biden is expected to announce his decision next week.
 Ms. Demings is well liked by colleagues, though for a time she was confusingly a member of both the centrist and progressive caucuses.
 On Tuesday, during a nationally televised hearing, she leveraged her experience in law enforcement while questioning the attorney general, William P. Barr, about the removal of U.S. attorneys under President Trump. ''As a former police detective, I have solved many cases based on patterns of behavior, and there is an alarming pattern I believe that is developing,'' she said. ''It appears that any time a U.S. attorney investigates the president or those close to them, he or she is removed and replaced by one of your friends.''
 Ms. Demings was born Valdez Butler, the youngest of seven children of a maid and a janitor. She grew up in a two-room house outside Jacksonville, and said growing up she experienced racism and the vestiges of segregation. She has said that her law enforcement career began in sixth grade, when she served on the school patrol and intervened in altercations on the bus.
 After graduating from Florida State University with a degree in criminology, she worked for a year at a security company and then for two years as a counselor to children in foster homes.
 In 1983, she heard a radio ad recruiting officers for the Orlando Police Department and decided to apply.
 Ms. Demings rose through the ranks, serving in nearly every part of the department, including the patrol division, the hostage negotiation team and the public information office, and earning stellar reviews.
 She also met a fellow officer whom she later married -- Jerry L. Demings. He became Orlando's first Black police chief in 1998; when she served as chief, he was the sheriff of Orange County, which encompasses Orlando. He is now Orange County's mayor.
 In 1999, the Gainesville Police Department asked Ms. Demings to help review its chief, who had resigned after 28 complaints from his 30 Black officers. Her review cleared the chief, saying they found no evidence of racial discrimination. The local chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. derided the inquiry as a public relations stunt.
 When similar issues arose in Orlando, Ms. Demings often supported police leadership, including in multiple op-eds in The Sentinel.
 ''As the highest-ranking African-American member of the Orlando Police Department, I have read and heard quite enough about the suggestions of racism, racial profiling and the like,'' she wrote in 2006, seeming to try to shut down a conversation that is still burning years later.
 Violent crime in Orlando was at a high when Ms. Demings became chief the next year. She responded by focusing on specific neighborhoods and housing complexes, and during her tenure, violent crime fell by 40 percent.
 ''If I had not been successful in reducing the crime rate, we know what people would've said,'' Ms. Demings said recently during a television appearance. '''First woman chief, oh my God, she can't handle that job.'''
 But her tenure also was marked by repeated allegations of police brutality.
 The first major case to come across her desk in 2007 involved an officer who pushed a woman down the stairs at a club where he worked as a security guard. The officer claimed the woman spit on him and drunkenly fell. Prosecutors charged her with felony battery on a police officer, and she lost her job. (They later dropped the charges, but she did not get her job back, her lawyer said.)
 In a rare instance of imposing discipline on an officer, investigators concluded his version was not accurate and removed two of his vacation days. But Ms. Demings returned one of the vacation days, citing a technical mistake in the process.
 Perhaps the most scrutinized case she faced occurred in 2010, when Officer Travis LaMont, then 26, encountered 84-year-old Daniel Daley arguing with a tow-truck driver outside of a bar.
 Mr. Daley urged Mr. LaMont to help, and he later acknowledged tapping the officer's arm several times. The officer told him to stop, and when he did not, he performed what is known as a ''dynamic takedown,'' leaning into Mr. Daley with his hip and throwing him to the ground.
 Mr. Daley landed on his head and broke his neck.
 Ms. Demings defended Mr. LaMont, saying, ''The officer performed the technique within department guidelines,'' although she said she would review the guidelines.
 That decision set off a protest outside Police Headquarters; one demonstrator held a sign with a photo of the veteran wearing a neck brace. ''Threat neutralized,'' it said, according to The Sentinel.
 A jury ordered the city to pay Mr. Daley $880,000.
 That same year, a group of officers pursuing an alleged credit card thief fired a flurry of shots into a minivan they claimed had rammed their vehicles, hitting one man at least five times. Video later showed that a police car pushed the minivan into the vehicles.
 Again, outrage against the police erupted, and the city paid the man $750,000. But the department cleared the officers.
 Ms. Demings declined to answer written questions about specific cases but said she did her best to hold officers accountable. 
 ''I did what I could, when I could and where I could,'' she said in an email.
 Asked in the interview her biggest mistake as chief, she cited the time her service weapon was stolen from her vehicle.
 Dwain Rivers, the longtime head of internal affairs at the Orlando Police Department, disputed the notion that Ms. Demings was overly protective of officers accused of misconduct. He said she was limited by union contracts, but she was as tough as any of the other chiefs for whom he has worked.
 Mr. Rivers said that Ms. Demings had engaged the community and helped create a professional organization to support Black officers.
 Under Ms. Demings, officers used force about 600 times a year, according to a New York Times analysis of city data. That did not significantly change during her tenure, although shootings involving police officers slightly increased. Today, the website MappingPoliceViolence.org lists Orlando as the fourth-worst major city for police killings per capita, a culture that activists say stems in part from Ms. Demings's tenure as chief.. 
 ''It wouldn't be that high if she had gotten with the community. She ignored us,'' said Lawanna Gelzer, the president of the Central Florida chapter of the National Action Network. ''And she gets up and criticizes other law enforcement agencies. It's hypocritical.''
 Ms. Demings has said comparisons are unfair, in part because Orlando has many bars that attract rowdy crowds.
 After Ms. Demings retired in 2011, she ran unsuccessfully for Congress and for mayor of Orange County. When she ran for Congress a second time in 2016, police brutality became a major campaign issue in the primary.
 Still, with support from the national party, Ms. Demings prevailed, impressing Democratic officials with her lively speaking style and the ease of her victory.
 ''If she had done a bad job as police chief, she wouldn't have been elected to Congress,'' said John Morgan, a major Democratic donor from Orlando. Mr. Morgan added, ''If being a police officer and a police chief is now a liability, then God help the country.''
 As protests have swept the nation, Ms. Demings has responded carefully. She published an op-ed in The Washington Post entitled, ''My fellow brothers and sisters in blue, what the hell are you doing?'' But she has declined to say whether the officers who killed Breonna Taylor should be arrested, as protesters have demanded.
 This spring, before the protests began but after impeachment hearings increased her profile, Ms. Demings updated her campaign website. Her logo previously read ''Chief Val Demings for Congress.'' Now it says ''Val Demings for Congress.''

NBC`s Kathy Park is outside the Stonewall with more on the efforts happening right now to try to save it. Kathy, good morning.
KATHY PARK (07:17:24): Peter and Kristen, good morning to you. March 16th, that`s when the Stonewall Inn temporarily shut down and the owners thought that it would be just for a couple of weeks. Well, those weeks turned into months. And with no money coming in, this historic symbol of pride is facing an uncertain future.
(Begin VT)
KATHY PARK (07:17:41): This morning, New York`s iconic Stonewall Inn, believed to be the birthplace of the modern day LGBTQ rights movement, is in need of help.
STACY LENTZ (07:17:49): The virus have brought in-- brought us to our knees.
KATHY PARK (07:17:52): Forced to shut down for months, the small business, like so many in the city, is fighting to survive.
(07:17:59): Did you have to lay off employees?
KURT KELLY (07:18:01): We had to lay off everybody.
KATHY PARK (07:18:02): It`s a stark contrast to last year when streets around the Greenwich Village bar were packed, celebrating fifty years of pride and progress since riots have fueled a worldwide movement.
STACY LENTZ (07:18:16): What happened here in 1969, that night`s not over. And even though the bar has shuttered and even though we`re in a global pandemic, we have to keep that fight alive.
KATHY PARK (07:18:24): The co-owners, who call themselves the keepers of history, started an online fundraiser to save Stonewall, a plea to the public that reached people like Jerry Houser (ph).
JERRY HOUSER (07:18:34): As soon as we heard, we`re like we`re going to stop by and get a drink. We`ll keep doing it as long as we can.
KATHY PARK (07:18:39): Designated a national landmark by President Obama in 2016, on Friday, he commemorated the anniversary of the riot by joining forces with celebrities and world leaders through a global livestream event.
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA (07:18:53): We`re almost fifty-one years since the night when the patrons of the Stonewall Inn stood up for their rights and set off one of America`s defining victories for civil rights.
KATHY PARK (07:19:04): Major cities had to cancel or postpone in-person pride festivities due to the pandemic. This weekend, many will be going virtual. MAN (07:19:12): Really, you got to feel it.
KATHY PARK (07:19:13): Yeah.
MAN (07:19:13): Yeah, when we`re not outside, we`re not at the parade, we`re not out.
KATHY PARK (07:19:18): But back where it all started, hope that this piece of living history will come back strong to carry the spirit of pride.
(End VT)
KATHY PARK (07:19:29): And there has been a tremendous amount of support for Stonewall. Donations online exceed one hundred ninety thousand dollars, but the owners say that they`re constantly worrying about their bottom line because it could be a while before New York City bars get the all clear to fully reopen. And right now in phase two, serving curbside drinks just isn`t enough. Guys, back to you.
PETER ALEXANDER (07:19:50): A piece of history but the fight continues. Kathy Park. Kathy, thanks very much.
(07:19:53): Still to come right here, why some people who went in for free coronavirus tests walked away with hefty medical bills.
KRISTEN WELKER (07:20:00): And a bit later, as summer kicks into high gear, we`re going to talk to our experts about the best way to get out of town with your family for the summer while keeping everyone safe. We`re back right after this.
(ANNOUNCEMENTS) PETER ALEXANDER (07:22:21): We are back on this Saturday morning with The Weekly Download, our lookback at the week that was.
KRISTEN WELKER (07:22:26): The coronavirus dominated the headlines once again, but it was also a week that saw another emotional funeral service for a black man shot by police.
(Begin VT)
KRISTEN WELKER (07:22:38): On Tuesday at Martin Luther King`s Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, family and friends gathered for a private memorial service for Rayshard Brooks, the twenty-seven-year old shot to death as he tried to run away from police officers in a Wendy`s parking lot.
REV. RAPHAEL G. WARNOCK (07:22:52): What do you do to stay alive? Comply like George Floyd or run like Rayshard Brooks? I`m not asking for a friend. I`m asking for myself.
KRISTEN WELKER (07:23:04): Thousands stood outside for a chance to pay their respects at a public viewing earlier in the week.
(07:23:10): In Louisville, Kentucky, Brett Hankison, one of the officers involved in the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor, was fired. The termination letter from the police chief reading--
MORGAN RADFORD (07:23:21): ""I find your conduct a shock to the conscience. Your actions have brought discredit upon yourself and the department.""
KRISTEN WELKER (07:23:26): Hankison is appealing. No word yet on the other officers involved. Meanwhile, all three men involved in the shooting death of Ahmaud Arbery as he ran through a Georgia neighborhood were indicted this week on felony murder charges.
(07:23:40): At Talladega Super Speedway, Bubba Wallace`s fellow NASCAR drivers pushed his car to the front of the track in a show of solidarity. SAM BROCK (07:23:48): Less than twenty-four hours earlier, a noose was discovered in Wallace`s garage stall, prompting this response, ""I will not give in nor will I back down. I will continue to proudly stand for what I believe in.""
KRISTEN WELKER (07:24:01): The FBI later determined it was not a hate crime and the noose had been there since October before Wallace was assigned that garage and before his call for a ban on the confederate flag. Wallace this week on TODAY.
BUBBA WALLACE (07:24:13): I was relieved just like many others to know that it wasn`t targeted towards me.
KRISTEN WELKER (07:24:18): The Fourth of July is still a week away, but illegal fireworks have been going off nationwide nearly every night for days.
GADI SCHWARTZ (07:24:25): The number of complaints compared to last year are astronomical, a seven hundred percent increase in Chicago. Boston up two thousand three hundred percent and New York up from around thirty complaints last June to now well over six thousand.
KRISTEN WELKER (07:24:40): Cancellation of public fireworks due to COVID may have led to the increase.
(07:24:44): Some of the week`s wildest moments caught on camera. Backing away just in time. A driver in Turkey narrowly avoided a geyser in the road created when a water pipe burst.
(07:24:55): And they`re going to need a bigger boat or just any boat. Surfers and kayakers in South Africa took off in a flash after they noticed that a great white shark was checking them out. But in Florida, a pod of dolphins was much more welcoming, quite fully leading a submarine through the water.
(07:25:14): And finally, one Amazon driver delivered some happiness to a family in Delaware--
WOMAN (07:25:17): Abracadabra.
KRISTEN WELKER (07:25:19): --after the little boy who lived there left some very specific instructions. The requests, knock three times and yell abracadabra before running away superfast. WOMAN (07:25:28): Abracadabra.
KRISTEN WELKER (07:25:31): Job well done.
(End VT)
KRISTEN WELKER (07:25:33): That Amazon driver is a good sport.
PETER ALEXANDER (07:25:36): So fun. Abracadabra. Must been something good in that box.
KRISTEN WELKER (07:25:38): That`s the trick.
(07:25:39): Still to come on TODAY, I`m going to show you my visit to the Baltimore Aquarium which is getting ready to reopen after being shut down for months.
PETER ALEXANDER (07:25:48): Plus, some of music`s biggest stars teaming up and facing off online. But first, these messages.
(ANNOUNCEMENTS)
WOMAN (07:30:01): The Emmy goes to The TODAY Show.
KRISTEN WELKER (07:30:06): We want to say a huge congratulations this morning to our colleagues at TODAY for their well-deserved daytime Emmy win for outstanding morning show. Executive producer Libby Leist and co- executive producer Tom Mazzarelli accepting the award there. We`re so proud of them, Savannah, Hoda and the whole team for their hard work. No one deserves it more.
PETER ALEXANDER (07:30:25): Yeah. Some good news to celebrate here in the middle of--
KRISTEN WELKER (07:30:28): Indeed.
PETER ALEXANDER (07:30:28): --what`s been a long haul this year so far. We want to begin this half an hour with a check of the headlines. And we start, of course, with the alarming surge of coronavirus cases across the country. The U.S. reached its highest daily total yet on Friday. With more than forty-five thousand cases in just twenty-four hours, bringing the total to just over 2.4 million nationwide. More than one hundred and twenty-five thousand Americans have now died from the virus. In hard hit Florida and Texas, officials are now closing all bars again to try to slow the spread. And the mayor of Miami announced overnight that he`ll be shutting down all beaches for the busy Fourth of July weekend.
KRISTEN WELKER (07:31:06): And Facebook is facing a major advertiser revolt this morning. Verizon, Coca-Cola and Unilever announcing overnight they are joining dozens of other brands on their advertising. Their decisions come in the wake of a social media campaign condemning the social media giant for how it deals with misinformation and hate speech. CEO Mark Zuckerberg spoke to advertisers earlier this week saying the company is taking stricter measures to police what`s posted online.
PETER ALEXANDER (07:31:31): And overnight, two popular animated series announced major shifts in who voices their characters. Producers of the Simpsons said in a statement that they will no longer have white actors voicing non-white characters. And Family Guy star Mike Henry tweeted that he`s stepping down from the role of Cleveland Brown, a black character that he`s voiced for twenty years.

Will Her Police Career Hurt or Help?",FALSE,"An Orlando police officer shoved a 27-year-old Hispanic woman down a flight of stairs, breaking her ankle. A jury ordered him to pay her medical bills.
Another officer slammed an 84-year-old World War II veteran to the ground during a car-towing dispute, resulting in doctors’ putting him into a medically induced coma. The city had to pay him $880,000.
Outside a Target store, officers investigating a robbery surrounded a minivan and fired into it nearly a dozen times, critically injuring an unarmed man. He won a $750,000 settlement.
The episodes all occurred between 2007 and 2010, long before the ongoing protests currently sweeping the country, denouncing the disproportionate use of police force against people of color. If the Orlando police felt even a fraction of the pressure that departments face today, the leadership did not bend to it: The chief, Val B. Demings, defended the officers in each case.
A decade later, Ms. Demings, now a second-term Democratic congresswoman, has emerged as a finalist to be Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s running mate. She rose in politics as a Black woman with law enforcement credentials, but her moment in the spotlight comes as the nation reckons with the difficult legacy of police brutality and racial discrimination.
If she is chosen as the vice-presidential nominee, her career could prove to be a political asset against an incumbent president who is building his re-election campaign around his call for law and order, while attacking Mr. Biden as weak on crime. But in the aftermath of the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, with protests continuing to rock the country, it could also be a political liability.
“This is an opportunity to change the way things are,” said David Porter, a former newspaper columnist active in progressive causes, who worked for Ms. Demings early in her political career. “I just don’t know that picking a cop would send the right message right now.”
Police misconduct cases are also the focus of renewed scrutiny for another top contender for the vice presidency, Senator Kamala Harris, who has been criticized for not aggressively prosecuting officers accused of wrongdoing as California’s attorney general. And they derailed the hopes of another candidate, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who withdrew last month amid criticism that as a prosecutor she had failed to charge officers accused of misconduct.
In recent weeks, Ms. Demings has become a leading voice calling for changes in policing, and she has cast herself as an experienced reformer, repeating that she started out as a social worker and brought a “social worker’s heart” to police work. But a review by The New York Times shows a more complicated record: that of a police leader with a long history of defending the status quo.
Ms. Demings, 63, spent 27 years in one of the most violent police departments of its size in the United States. She repeatedly defended fellow officers, dating at least to 1999, when she helped vindicate a white chief in a neighboring city of allegations of racial discrimination. During her time as chief, crime sharply declined, but police use of force remained high; a 2015 study by The Orlando Sentinel showed that in the second half of Ms. Demings’s tenure and during the tenure of her successor, officers used force at a rate that was twice as high as those of officers at other departments of similar size.
While she was chief, her department also began arresting people for violating a years-old ban on distributing food to homeless residents in city parks.
And in Congress, Ms. Demings is one of the only Democrats to co-sponsor the Protect and Serve Act, which would make it a hate crime to attack a law enforcement officer.
In an interview this week, Ms. Demings stood by her record on police accountability, saying she improved hiring practices and increased officer training. But she said her top priority as chief was addressing a spike in crime.
“Police work is not a perfect science,” she said. “We’re there to clean up messes. And sometimes when you clean up messes, it’s not pretty.”
Supporters said Ms. Demings should not be judged for all the flaws of policing in America.
“You can’t blame Val for institutional racism,” said Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the highest-ranking African-American in Congress.
Mr. Clyburn, who has not endorsed anyone to be Mr. Biden’s running mate, is one of many Democrats who believe Ms. Demings could bring a lot to the ticket.
She rose from humble roots to become Orlando’s first female chief and a House manager in Mr. Trump’s impeachment trial this year. Her supporters believe she could appeal to enough independents, and perhaps even Republicans, to improve Mr. Biden’s prospects in Florida, a battleground state where major elections are routinely decided by razor-thin margins.
Mr. Biden is expected to announce his decision next week.
Ms. Demings is well liked by colleagues, though for a time she was confusingly a member of both the centrist and progressive caucuses.
On Tuesday, during a nationally televised hearing, she leveraged her experience in law enforcement while questioning the attorney general, William P. Barr, about the removal of U.S. attorneys under President Trump. “As a former police detective, I have solved many cases based on patterns of behavior, and there is an alarming pattern I believe that is developing,” she said. “It appears that any time a U.S. attorney investigates the president or those close to them, he or she is removed and replaced by one of your friends.”
Ms. Demings was born Valdez Butler, the youngest of seven children of a maid and a janitor. She grew up in a two-room house outside Jacksonville, and said growing up she experienced racism and the vestiges of segregation. She has said that her law enforcement career began in sixth grade, when she served on the school patrol and intervened in altercations on the bus.
After graduating from Florida State University with a degree in criminology, she worked for a year at a security company and then for two years as a counselor to children in foster homes.
In 1983, she heard a radio ad recruiting officers for the Orlando Police Department and decided to apply.
Ms. Demings rose through the ranks, serving in nearly every part of the department, including the patrol division, the hostage negotiation team and the public information office, and earning stellar reviews.
She also met a fellow officer whom she later married — Jerry L. Demings. He became Orlando’s first Black police chief in 1998; when she served as chief, he was the sheriff of Orange County, which encompasses Orlando. He is now Orange County’s mayor.
In 1999, the Gainesville Police Department asked Ms. Demings to help review its chief, who had resigned after 28 complaints from his 30 Black officers. Her review cleared the chief, saying they found no evidence of racial discrimination. The local chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. derided the inquiry as a public relations stunt.
When similar issues arose in Orlando, Ms. Demings often supported police leadership, including in multiple op-eds in The Sentinel.
“As the highest-ranking African-American member of the Orlando Police Department, I have read and heard quite enough about the suggestions of racism, racial profiling and the like,” she wrote in 2006, seeming to try to shut down a conversation that is still burning years later.
Violent crime in Orlando was at a high when Ms. Demings became chief the next year. She responded by focusing on specific neighborhoods and housing complexes, and during her tenure, violent crime fell by 40 percent.
“If I had not been successful in reducing the crime rate, we know what people would’ve said,” Ms. Demings said recently during a television appearance. “‘First woman chief, oh my God, she can’t handle that job.’”
But her tenure also was marked by repeated allegations of police brutality.
The first major case to come across her desk in 2007 involved an officer who pushed a woman down the stairs at a club where he worked as a security guard. The officer claimed the woman spit on him and drunkenly fell. Prosecutors charged her with felony battery on a police officer, and she lost her job. (They later dropped the charges, but she did not get her job back, her lawyer said.)
In a rare instance of imposing discipline on an officer, investigators concluded his version was not accurate and removed two of his vacation days. But Ms. Demings returned one of the vacation days, citing a technical mistake in the process.
Perhaps the most scrutinized case she faced occurred in 2010, when Officer Travis LaMont, then 26, encountered 84-year-old Daniel Daley arguing with a tow-truck driver outside of a bar.
 Mr. Daley urged Mr. LaMont to help, and he later acknowledged tapping the officer’s arm several times. The officer told him to stop, and when he did not, he performed what is known as a “dynamic takedown,” leaning into Mr. Daley with his hip and throwing him to the ground.
Mr. Daley landed on his head and broke his neck.
Ms. Demings defended Mr. LaMont, saying, “The officer performed the technique within department guidelines,” although she said she would review the guidelines.
That decision set off a protest outside Police Headquarters; one demonstrator held a sign with a photo of the veteran wearing a neck brace. “Threat neutralized,” it said, according to The Sentinel.
A jury ordered the city to pay Mr. Daley $880,000.
That same year, a group of officers pursuing an alleged credit card thief fired a flurry of shots into a minivan they claimed had rammed their vehicles, hitting one man at least five times. Video later showed that a police car pushed the minivan into the vehicles.
Again, outrage against the police erupted, and the city paid the man $750,000. But the department cleared the officers.
Ms. Demings declined to answer written questions about specific cases but said she did her best to hold officers accountable. 
“I did what I could, when I could and where I could,” she said in an email.
Asked in the interview her biggest mistake as chief, she cited the time her service weapon was stolen from her vehicle.
Dwain Rivers, the longtime head of internal affairs at the Orlando Police Department, disputed the notion that Ms. Demings was overly protective of officers accused of misconduct. He said she was limited by union contracts, but she was as tough as any of the other chiefs for whom he has worked.
Mr. Rivers said that Ms. Demings had engaged the community and helped create a professional organization to support Black officers.
Under Ms. Demings, officers used force about 600 times a year, according to a New York Times analysis of city data. That did not significantly change during her tenure, although shootings involving police officers slightly increased. Today, the website MappingPoliceViolence.org lists Orlando as the fourth-worst major city for police killings per capita, a culture that activists say stems in part from Ms. Demings’s tenure as chief.. 
“It wouldn’t be that high if she had gotten with the community. She ignored us,” said Lawanna Gelzer, the president of the Central Florida chapter of the National Action Network. “And she gets up and criticizes other law enforcement agencies. It’s hypocritical.”
Ms. Demings has said comparisons are unfair, in part because Orlando has many bars that attract rowdy crowds.
After Ms. Demings retired in 2011, she ran unsuccessfully for Congress and for mayor of Orange County. When she ran for Congress a second time in 2016, police brutality became a major campaign issue in the primary.
Still, with support from the national party, Ms. Demings prevailed, impressing Democratic officials with her lively speaking style and the ease of her victory.
“If she had done a bad job as police chief, she wouldn’t have been elected to Congress,” said John Morgan, a major Democratic donor from Orlando. Mr. Morgan added, “If being a police officer and a police chief is now a liability, then God help the country.”
As protests have swept the nation, Ms. Demings has responded carefully. She published an op-ed in The Washington Post entitled, “My fellow brothers and sisters in blue, what the hell are you doing?” But she has declined to say whether the officers who killed Breonna Taylor should be arrested, as protesters have demanded.
This spring, before the protests began but after impeachment hearings increased her profile, Ms. Demings updated her campaign website. Her logo previously read “Chief Val Demings for Congress.” Now it says “Val Demings for Congress.”

Four federal executions were scheduled but a district court judge had suspended them to allow for legal challenges to the lethal injection that was to be used.
The district court decision had come just hours before the first execution, of former white supremacist Daniel Lewis Lee, who was convicted with another man of murdering a family of three during a robbery intended to help fund the founding of an ""Aryan Peoples Republic"".
The prisoners ""have not made the showing required to justify last-minute intervention by a Federal Court,"" the Supreme Court said in a ruling released in the early hours of Tuesday.
""We vacate the District Court's preliminary injunction so that the... executions may proceed as planned.""
In staying the executions, District Judge Tanya Chutkan had ruled that the use of a single drug, pentobarbital, to carry out the executions could cause ""extreme pain and needless suffering"" and may violate a constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment.
An appeals court had upheld that order before the Supreme Court vacated it.
Lee would be the first federal inmate to be executed in the United States since 2003 and the first since President Donald Trump announced plans to resume federal executions.
There have been just three federal executions since the death penalty was reinstated in 1988.
Lee and another man, Chevie Kehoe, were convicted in Arkansas in 1999 of the 1996 murders of gun dealer William Mueller, his wife, and her eight-year-old daughter.
According to prosecutors, the pair robbed Mueller to steal guns that they planned to sell to finance the founding of a white supremacist ""Aryan Peoples Republic"" in the Pacific Northwest.
Lee, who has since renounced his white supremacist beliefs according to his lawyers, was sentenced to death while Kehoe received three life sentences without the possibility of parole.
- 'Untenable position' -
Earlene Peterson, 81, whose daughter and granddaughter were killed, has campaigned against Lee's death sentence, saying she wants him to spend the rest of his life behind bars.
""It's an easy way out,"" Peterson told The New York Times. ""He should have to live through this. Like I did.""
Peterson and relatives of other victims also filed a lawsuit seeking to delay the execution, arguing that it was dangerous for them to travel to Terre Haute to witness Lee's execution because of the coronavirus pandemic. 
An appeals court dismissed the suit on Sunday, but Baker Kurrus, a lawyer for the families, said he would take it to the Supreme Court.
""The federal government has put this family in the untenable position of choosing between their right to witness Danny Lee's execution and their own health and safety,"" Kurrus said.
The Supreme Court, however, denied their application.
The Bureau of Prisons said Sunday that a member of the Terre Haute prison staff had tested positive for COVID-19.
""There's no reason for anybody to be carrying out executions right now because of the pandemic,"" said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center.
More than 1,000 US religious leaders urged Trump last week to abandon plans to resume federal executions and Dunham accused the president of ""political use of the death penalty.""
Trump, who faces a tough re-election battle in November, has called for stepped-up use of capital punishment, especially for killers of police officers and drug traffickers.
Only a handful of US states, mainly in the conservative South, still actively carry out executions. In 2019, 22 people were put to death.
Most crimes are tried under state laws, but federal courts handle some of the most serious crimes, including terror attacks and hate crimes.

The date marks the day in 1865 when Union Gen. Gordon Granger read the Emancipation Proclamation in Galveston, Texas, informing former slaves of their freedom provided by the order President Abraham Lincoln issued Jan. 1, 1863. 
Juneteenth has been a state holiday in Texas for 40 years. Over the intervening years, 46 other states adopted similar resolutions -- including Pennsylvania. 
Opal Lee, 93, of Fort Worth, Texas, has been campaigning for years to have the date made a federal holiday, walking 2.5 miles in cities across the country to symbolize the 2½ years it took for slaves in the deepest South to hear the news they had been freed. 
Lee told The New York Times a mob of white supremacists burned her family's Fort Worth-area home when she was 12, a move that launched her on a lifetime of teaching and lobbying to have Juneteenth made a national holiday. 
Opal Lee 
Pennsylvania's General Assembly named Juneteenth a state holiday last year. 
As Black Lives Matter protests continued in cities and towns across the country, Gov. Tom Wolf declared Friday, the first anniversary of the enactment of Act 9, a paid holiday for state employees. 
The Hill reported late Thursday that U.S. Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Kamala Harris, D-Calif., were expected to introduce resolutions making the date a federal holiday. 
U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, D-Scranton, said he wants the federal government to make Juneteenth a holiday as a way to acknowledge the nation's history and celebrate its black citizens. 
""But commemorating Juneteenth is not a substitute for taking decisive action to protect the lives of black Americans. Recent events in our nation highlight that we have yet to overcome all the vestiges of slavery,"" Casey said. ""Black Americans continue to be disproportionate victims of hate crimes and police brutality, and the recent murders of George Floyd and others underscore the inadequacy of passivity and the cruel impact that slavery, and much of its aftermath, has had on our country and its citizenry.""

LONDON -- The police in Birmingham, England, arrested a man on Monday and charged him with stabbing eight people, killing one, in a series of apparently random attacks in the city early Sunday. 
 The suspect, a 27-year-old man whose name was not immediately released, was charged with murder and seven counts of attempted murder. He was detained in the Selly Oak neighborhood in southwest Birmingham around 4 a.m. local time, the police said.
 A 23-year-old man died in the attacks on Sunday, and two other victims, aged 19 and 32, were in critical condition at a hospital on Monday, the police said. Five other victims, aged 23 to 33, sustained less serious injuries.
 The police said they were unable to discern a pattern in the attacks, leading them to believe that the victims had been chosen at random. Steve Graham, chief superintendent of the West Midlands Police, said on Sunday that there was no indication the attacks were related to terrorism or gang violence, nor that they were a hate crime.
 Starting in the early hours of Sunday, the assaults spanned the center of the city, which is about 120 miles northwest of London, lasted at least 90 minutes and ended in a bustling nightlife area. Witnesses said that an attacker wearing a hooded top had approached the victims without warning, and eluded bystanders' attempts to capture him.
 ''It happened very quickly,'' one witness, Savvas Sfrantziz, a bar owner in the nightlife area, told Sky News, describing one of the attacks. ''He just went up to her and just stabbed her. I've never seen anything like it.''
 Officers sifted through surveillance camera footage and asked for photographs and videos from the public to help in the search. One tip led them to an address in Selly Oak, where the arrest was made. 
 In a statement released on Monday, the police said the arrest was ''a crucial development,'' but underlined that the investigation was continuing. ''We still need to speak to any witnesses who saw what happened who've not yet spoken to us, or anyone who may have video footage or photos of the incidents or the attacker,'' the statement added.
 The mayor of Birmingham, Andy Street, said in a post on Twitter that the attacks were a ''one-off tragedy.''
 ''But the message must be it is utterly uncharacteristic of Birmingham,'' he added. ''The thing that is characteristic will be seen to be a defiant response where all communities come together to condemn it and prove that we can continue all to live together in harmony.''
 Knife crime in England and Wales has been on the rise for several years and reached a record annual high for the year ending March 2020, according to a government report. The police recorded 46,265 offenses involving knives or sharp instruments in that period, an increase of 6 percent over the previous 12 months. According to the Office for National Statistics, 256 people died in such attacks in England and Wales in the year up to March 2020.
 Apart from the killing in Birmingham, there have been other fatal knife attacks in Britain in recent months. Three people were killed in June in a stabbing at a park in Reading, England, that the police described as terrorism. In July, there were three deadly stabbings and two fatal shootings in London in the space of a week.

21,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1001/Files (250).DOCX","CE Noticias Financieras English",2020-12-29,"2767 words",NA,NA,NA,"What were the 10 worst anti-Semitic incidents in the world in 2020 according to the Simon Wiesenthal Center",FALSE,"The Wiesenthal Centre, a traditional anti-Nazi and human rights organization, produced a survey with the list of the 10 worst anti-Semitic and anti-Israel incidents that occurred during this 2020 that was completed. The entity documented the most serious events that occurred in the United States and Europe. The top ten is done as follows.
1 Coronavirus,the latest virus, feeds the oldest virus in history. According to the Center, ""since the early stages of the pandemic in February 2020, far-right extremists blamed Jews and Asian-Americans for the virus through social media platforms. A false warning from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested that anyone infected visit a local synagogue or mosque to spread the deadly virus. Another post with an image titled ""Holocough"" (""Holotos"") asked: 
""If you have the bug, give a hug. It transmits the flu to all Jews"" (in rhyme in the English version: ""If you have the bug, give a hug. Spread the flu to every Jew""). Anti-Semites have blamed Jews from the Black Pesta in the Middle Ages to the Spanish Influenza in World War I,"" they noted in a report presented on Tuesday, December 29.
At the close of this first item, they completed: ""In the 1930s, Nazi propaganda compared Jews to disease-spreading vermin. In Germany, the announcement of possible vaccines took anti-vaccines to the streets, including far-right protesters carrying anti-Semitic cartels. And as vaccines begin to spread globally in December, a UK government report indicates that some anti-vaccine forums on social media are ""riddled with anti-Semitism.""
2 The second item identified was the social network ""Telegram"", as chosen by the ""violent haedors"". The report explains ""during the coronavirus pandemic, social media has served as lifeguards for families, friends, schools and businesses. Under pressure from the Simon Wiesenthal Center and other activists, Facebook and other media giants have increased restrictions on access to hate groups. As a result, groups of neo-Nazis, white supremacists and many others turn to Telegram, a platform with few or no rules or content moderation. The murderous Atomwaffen Division, its successor, the National Socialist Order, the extremist La Base, the Boogaloo Movement, the violent Nordic Resistance Movement that targeted Jewish institutions in Yom Kippur (Day of Forgiveness) in four Scandinavian countries, all of which have found their home on Telegram. Hamas and other Islamist terrorists with hate and violence agendas also actively issue their flows to their enemies.
3 Third, the center points to the Godfather of hatred that spreads hatred of the Jews among the new generations. The entity recalls that ""in its July 4 speech, the leader of the Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan, continued his more than 35-year hate campaign against Jews and Judaism, claiming at one point that 'the Jews tried to kill him at one time with 'irradiated seeds'' and, referring to Jewish lawyer Alan Dershowitz as 'Satan disguised as a lawyer'. Amid the racism-ridden atmosphere following the assassination of George Floyd, Farrakhan's hatred of Jews inspired DeSean Jackson, the open receiver of the Philadelphia Eagles; Stephen Jackson retired star of the NBA and other figures from culture and sport to express admiration for himself and to declaim orre-post some of his anti-Semitic prejudices,"" he explains in the report.
It also notes that Farrakhan testified against coronavirus vaccines. ""The virus is a pestilence of Heaven. The only way to stop it is by going to heaven... They're conspiring to vaccinate seven billion, 500 million people. Dr. Fauci, Bill [and Melinda] Gates, want to depopulate the earth. ""and add that if you get the shot "" you're sure to die now. They [only] want a faster death."" The most powerful replica of the litany of anti-Semitism came from an iconic sports superstar, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, whose opinion piece in The Hollywood Reporter defied intolerance and deafening silence.
4 Desecraations, fires, attacks on synagogues as America falters amid riots after George Floyd's death in Los Angeles in 2019. The Wiesenthal Center notes: ""Last year, the FBI reported that nearly 62% of religion-based hate crimes in the United States targeted Jews. Even forced closures of places of worship and other strict restrictions on the daily life of that country did not give a respite to the oldest hatred in history. Synagogues in Los Angeles and Oakland, California and Kenosha, Wisconsin were the target of the aftermath of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests over the murders of George Floyd and Jake Blake. The chabad houses in Portland, Oregon and Newark, Delaware were destroyed by arson. On the third night of Hanukkah, a member of the Jewish community attending an open-air ignition ceremony in Menorah (eight- arms ritual chandelier) was injured by an anti-Semitic driving an SUV (sports utility vehicle). American Jews continue to be demonized by extremists on both the far right and the far left.
5 Ayatollah Khamenei: ""Deploy the 'Final Solution' to the more than six million living Jews,"" Iran's Foreign Minister calls Jews 'Kikes'. In the annual report, the center recalls that ""In celebration of Al Quds Day (Jerusalem), a holiday invented by Iran's supreme leader, the Ayatollah Khamenei website, invoked the Nazis' ""Final Solution"". In defending the supreme leader, Chancellor Mohammad Javad Zarif used an anti-Semitic insult as recorded by MEMRI (Middle East Media Research Institute): ""What is our solution? The Honourable Leader Khamenei has expressed the solution. We're not talking about throwing the Kikes (Johood in Persian) into the sea, or a military attack, or suicide operations. The Leader has said what the solution is and has been presented to the United Nations. Our solution is a popular referendum."" Meanwhile, Germany and other large European countries with strong economic ties to Iran remain stoically silent following the denial of the Khamenei Holocaust and continued genocidal threats against the Jewish people,"" the report notes.
6 In an act reminiscent of the Nazi era, the Court of Justice of the European Union supported the prohibition of Shekhyta (ritual killing) while anti-Semitism reaches levels never seen since World War II. As the document explains, ""Just after becoming German Chancellor in 1933, Adolf Hitler banned the Jewish ritual slaughter of animals without prior stunning. Now, in 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Community set the stage for all European countries to do the same. Israel's Ambassador to Belgium, Emmanuel Nachson, said the ruling is ""catastrophic and a blow to Jewish life in Europe,"" JTA reported. Widespread anti-Semitismis approaching levels not seen since before the Holocaust. French Jews fear the next violent attack by Islamists and face a judicial system that has set the killers of French Jews free. An advertisement at a bus stop recalls the medieval anti-Semitic blood libel, was published in the city of Toulouse, where in 2012 a young rabbi and three children were killed on the grounds of a Jewish school by an Islamist terrorist""
She also notes that a national beauty pageant in France had an act of anti-Semitism. ""Uncle Hitler forgot to exterminate miss Provence, "" was the attack on social media when Miss Provence, April Benayoum, 21, took second place in Miss France 2020. The full report: ""The Head of Germany's National Security Service warns that anti-Semitism is ""increasing dramatically"" as the country's cultural elite seeks to restore the anti-Semitic Boycott, Disinversion and Sanctions (BDS). Traditional anti-Semitic ""carnivals"" in Belgium and Spain openly mock Jews, dead and alive; anti-COVID-19 demonstrations in the UK target Jews; Polish President Andrzej Duda's campaign used anti-Semitism to win votes. A survey of 16 countries found that 20% of respondents believe that a secret clique of Jews influences global political and economic issues. A new report by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) found that Jews were the target of a quarter of hate crimes in Europe.""
7 In seventh place, the international entity points to the German elite, which launches a total assault to re-release them BDS, Boycot, disinversion and anti-Semitic sanctions. ""German officials,"" the report explains, ""recognize that anti-Semitic crimes, from neo-Nazis to Islamists, continue their alarming rise. Nearly a year after the attack on Halle Synagogue, a religious student was seriously wounded by a neo-Nazi outside a Hamburg synagogue. But none of these hate crimes, or the growing embrace of mutual peace, trade and cultural ties between Israel and some Arab states, stopped key elites seeking to overturn the Bundestag vote that labeled the BDS anti-Semitic,"" the Center explains.
""Gathered in secret for a year, the so-called Union of Cultural Institutions comprising more than two dozen of the 'Who's Who' in Germany, - including the Goethe Institute, the Federal Cultural Foundation, the Deutsches Theatre in Berlin, the German Exchange of Academic Artists, the Berliner Festspiele, and the Einstein Forum, attacked the Bundestag BDS vote for violation of freedom of expression. The signatories specifically thanked Andreas Gorgen, Director-General of the Ministry of Cultural Affairs and Communication, ""for the advice and contributions to the debate"""" completes the report.
The Wiesenthal Centre had already criticized Gorgen for defending a prominent BDS proponent in South Africa. This was followed by a similar call from nine hundred artists, academics, writers and other cultural figures who called the Anti-BDS Resolution ""dangerous"" and ""to the detriment of the democratic public sphere"". ""Nonsense, "" countered Die Welt's Chief Commentator Jacques Schuster. With its Anti-BDS Resolution, Schuster explained, the Bundestag became one of the first parliaments in the Western world to make clear that anti-Zionism is a form of anti-Semitism and, ""this is precisely what these cultural trade union institutions oppose,"" adding: ""In truth, the initiative does not care about preventing freedom of expression; doesn't want you toyour own world view will be destroyed."" All of this can help explain why three MPs continue to support the anti-Semitic German-Palestinian Society (GPS) that also promotes the BDS.
Social Democrat MP Aydan Izogus and Green Party MP Omid Nouripour co-sponsored a parliamentary initiative in 2013 to label Jewish west bank products, and are supporters of the pro-Iranian regime, along with Left Party DEPUTY Christine Buchholz, who has defended Hezbollah's ""resistance"" against Israel.
They all listened deafly to protests by Jewish-German Holocaust survivors and community leaders. Their support continues even after a GPS roaming ""art"" exhibition that includes the terrorist mantra calling for the end of Israel, ""From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free."" Meanwhile, the prestigious Jusos - Germany's Socialist Youth Movement - SPD Party, adopted a Solidarity Resolution with the youth wing of Fatah, the PLO's main faction, giving it the character of ""sister organization"". Bild reported that some participants at a Fatah Juvenile demonstration in 2018 were wearing false explosive belts and chanting slogans calling for the destruction of Israel.
8 Eighth, the anti-Nazi centre points to the new Litmus test (a crucial question for assessing the admission or rejection of a candidate to a political post) on American campuses, which asks ""Are you now or have you ever been a Zionist?"" ""Peace has epped between Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan. Bahrain has adopted the definition of anti-Semitism of the International Alliance for Holocaust Memory (IHRA), which includes virulent anti-Zionism. But there is no peace, not even a 'ceasefire', on American campuses, where Jewish students continue to be demonized and ostracized because of their support for the Jewish state. The BDS's extreme anti-peace and anti-Semitic campaign is the main weapon,"" the report explains.
""The University of Illinois' failure to confront hatred and defend Jewish students goes back five years. A senior university official kicked a Jewish student out of a Student Electoral Commission because she was, ""Jewish, I had to take her away because she's sessed."" Last year, mandatory diversity training included ""Palestine &the; Great Return March: Palestinian Resistance to 70 Years of Israeli Terror,"" recalls and adds ""In September 2020, the Illinois Student Government Resolution (""ISG"") in support of BLM- Black Lives Matter also had a BDS component. During one of these ISG meetings, a senator suggested that a Jewish student could be allowed to join the Committee as long as he was not affiliated with a Jewish organization such as Chabad or Hillel. A member of the Faculty (body of teachers) was present and said nothing,"" recalls the report, which also recalls that ""on October 14, 2020, a Jewish and pro-Israel ISG senator resigned after persistent harassment based on her identity. She was called an advocate of genocide and a white supremacist. Another student who ran for student body president was called Nazi because he was Jewish and supported Israel. All of this has led the Brandeis Center for Human Rights to file a Title VI Complaint with the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights.
9 Ninth, the centre points out that the questionnaire of the socialist democratic party incorporates the anti-Semitic BDS and a prohibition on travel to the Jewish state. ""Even though the U.S. Secretary of State labeled the BDS as anti-Semitic, hate crimesAgainst American Jews - especially against New York Jews - rose to record levels, the Democratic Socialist Party of New York City (DSA) sent a 2021 Questionnaire to all potential candidates for municipal office, which will surely generate more hatred against Israeli democracy and its Zionist supporters. DSA expects its candidates to support the BDS and commit not to travel to Israel. DSA, a growing political force in New York, has already helped defeat the Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and numerous state officials. New York is home to 1.1 million Jews, the world's largest Jewish community. Not a word about whether the DSA is looking for a travel ban on China, Iran or Venezuela,"" the report explains.
10 Chile: a man who could lead the nation. The ranking developed by the Wiesenthal Center states that the Trans-Andean country, ""is home to the third largest Jewish community in Latin America with about 20,000 members. It also houses the largest Palestinian community outside the Arab world. In recent years, his leadership has become radicalized and aligned with Hamas's ideology. Architect Daniel Jadue is the Mayor of the Commune of Recoleta, in Santiago de Chile, the capital of the country. Jadue, a member of the Communist Party, is a national personality and is mentioned as a potential future President,"" they explain.
According to the entity, ""using municipal funds to finance pro-BDS (Boycott, Disinversion and Sanctions) and anti-Israel activities, Mayor Jadue points to the Jewish community with pernicious defamations reminiscent of those of 'The Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion'. He accuses Jews of controlling the media and of double loyalty: ""It is an insult that the State of Israel through its agents here in Chile wants to import the contest...""..."" they have to learn and define whether or not they are Chilean citizens."" Last year, the City Council of Recoleta adopted a resolution that read: ""The Palestinian people have been the victim of a deliberate plan of violence and terror by armed Zionist groups. ""Jadue insists, "" The leaders of the Jewish community in Chile act in Chile on behalf of the State of Israel... "", and he adds, ""I get along very well with the Jews, with the Zionists I have some problems."" Jadue always refers to Chile's Jews as Chile's ""Zionist"" community,"" he lists.
The entity warns that in ""At a time of growing global anti-Semitism and Islamist terrorism attacking from France to the Philippines, Jadue insults three Abrahamic religions: ""If you are born into a Jewish family, you can legitimately believe that you are part of the Chosen People and that you can kill the Palestinians to keep their lands ... If you are born into a Muslim family, you can legitimately believe that a war can be Santa ... If you are born into a Christian family, you may come to think that the poor are blessed and that after death they will be rewarded."" All of this comes from a man who could lead a nation.""

Representative Adriano Espaillat Stands with House Democrats, Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) Colleagues to Demand Justice
Espaillat Highlights Inclusion of Legislative Priorities in National Overhaul of Reforms to Stop Police Brutality, Hold Law Enforcement Officers Accountable, and Upend the Criminal Justice System
NEW YORK, NY - Today, Representative Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) announced support of the Justice in Policing Act, led by members of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC), which would take key steps to achieve transformational, structural change to combat the pattern of police violence:
The Justice in Policing Act aims to remove barriers to prosecuting police misconduct and recovering damages from officers who have violated civilians' rights, including by ending qualified immunity by law enforcement; demilitarize the police by limiting the transfer of military weaponry to state and local police departments; combat police brutality, including by requiring body and dashboard cameras, banning chokeholds, ending the use of no-knock warrants in drug cases and enacting steps to end racial profiling; step up pressure on the Justice Department to address systemic racial discrimination by law enforcement; and, officially make lynching a federal hate crime, as the House did in passing H.R. 35 earlier this year.
""I am proud to stand in unity and solidarity with my Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) colleagues to demand justice and call for an end to the police brutality and targeting of African Americans around the nation,"" said Rep. Adriano Espaillat (NY-13). ""I have long fought for communities of color in my district and will continue my fight for African American and Latino families to ensure all persons are treated equally under the law. Now is the time for systemic and transformational reform of America's policing system, to transition away from a policing-first model. The best anti-crime policies are anti-poverty policies, and we must invest in our communities to foster opportunity. If we fail to act and implement real change, history will judge us by our inaction and failure to ensure life, liberty and justice for all persons in our nation.""
Last week, Rep. Espaillat announced the Harlem Manifesto, a series of legislative policies to urge for the end of police brutality and targeting of African Americans throughout the nation. Additionally, Espaillat introduced the Denial of Rights Prevention and Accountability Act that would hold officers accountable in court for abuses committed under the color of the law, and create a new statute that would lower the mens rea bar from willful deprivation of rights to reckless deprivation of rights, thereby permitting prosecutors to successfully hold law enforcement officers liable for the deprivation of civil rights and liberties.
Espaillat legislative priorities he fought for and prioritized in his Harlem Manifesto that are included in CBC, House Democrats' Justice in Policing Act:
* Denial of Rights Prevention and Accountability Act - Congressman Espaillat introduced this bill, which changes the 18 U.S.C. Sec. 242 mens rea requirement from willfulness to recklessness, permitting prosecutors to successfully hold law enforcement accountable for the deprivation of civil rights and civil liberties.
* Eric Garner Excessive Use of Force Prevention Act - This bill prohibits and makes punishable the use of a chokehold or any maneuvers that restrict the flow of blood or oxygen to the brain.
* Ending Qualified Immunity Act - This bill explicitly states that the judicial theory of qualified immunity is not a defense to liability, ensuring that the courts can't let police officers off the hook for civil charges in cases constitutional violations.
* Police Exercising Absolute Care with Everyone (PEACE) Act - This bill changes the use of force standard for officers to require that force must be necessary, as a last resort, to prevent imminent death or serious bodily injury, and no reasonable alternatives were available.
* Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act - This bill prohibits the Defense Department from transferring military weapons to state and local law enforcement agencies.
* Law Enforcement Trust and Integrity Act - This bill creates accreditation standards to ensure compliance with approved practices and transparency within the community.
* Police CAMERA Act - This bill requires all law enforcement officers to wear body cameras and prohibit the seizure of cell phones or other recording devices used to document police interactions without a person's consent or a warrant."
23,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1001/Files (250).DOCX","The Atlanta Journal-Constitution",2020-08-19,"1065 words","METRO; Pg. 1B","Jim Galloway",NA,"AJC EXCLUSIVE; ; Trump's COVID-19 policy might infect others in GOP",FALSE,"That the coronavirus pandemic was a focus of the Democratic National Convention from the get-go surprised no one, least of all the GOP candidates who will dwell beneath President Donald Trump on the November ballot.
And these lesser Republicans are getting nervous.
Not for the first time, a Washington Post/ABC News poll, released as Democrats assembled behind their laptops for their virtual kickoff, identified the president's COVID-19 response as an obvious vulnerability.
Fifty-nine percent of those surveyed disapprove of Trump's handling of the pandemic, including 62% of independents and 1 in every 5 Republicans.
Despite the advance warning, Monday's slings and arrows still stung.
""My dad was a healthy 65-year-old. His only preexisting condition was trusting Donald Trump -- and for that he paid with his life,"" said Kristin Urquiza, whose father died of COVID-19 in Arizona.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York faulted ""the failed federal government that saw New York get ambushed by their negligence, and then watched New York suffer, but all through it learned absolutely nothing."" (No, Cuomo didn't mention his own nursing home debacle.)
Michelle Obama, the former first lady, brutally connected Trump's handling of the pandemic with the larger issue of competency. ""He has had more than enough time to prove that he can do the job, but he is clearly in over his head. He cannot meet this moment,"" she said.
Before any of these Democrats spoke, the Trump campaign attempted an inoculation and put Gov. Brian Kemp on a telephone presser. The governor defended the Trump record.
""Nobody's ever promised a vaccine by the end of the summer and the fall,"" Kemp said -- a delivery schedule that experts say is unlikely to be met.
""There's very promising trials going on right now,"" the governor said -- while admitting that speed isn't the only consideration.
But the governor himself has significantly altered his own coronavirus policy, which has taken a beating from leaked weekly state-by-state reports from the White House task force.
Last week, Kemp dropped his lawsuit against Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and the Atlanta City Council for a masking mandate that Kemp said his emergency orders forbade.
Then Saturday, the governor issued a revised emergency order that specifically allowed local governments to require face coverings in public spaces -- though the governor requires private business participation to be voluntary.
Asked to explain the shift, the governor at one point admitted to a need to resolve a conflict in his approach.
""We had gotten to the point where, with schools reopening, that we needed to be consistent. We were allowing the schools to do masks if they wanted to,"" Kemp said.
On the other hand, the governor said his lawsuit was never about masks. ""This was about the mayor of Atlanta trying to start shutting businesses down and ruining livelihoods of our citizens. And I just was not going to allow that to happen. It's unfortunate that the press only wanted to talk about masks, because that's not what it was about,"" he said.
The thing is, Bottoms and her staff will tell you that she never claimed the power to shut down businesses or cap their customer traffic as the coronavirus asserted itself in her city. They will also tell you that the mediation sessions ordered by a Fulton County judge were concerned solely with the masking issue.
Which Kemp himself kind of admitted. ""(The mayor) wanted to be able to control what happened on personal property and private property -- and I don't think that's appropriate,"" Kemp said. ""If business owners want to allow local governments to enforce mask mandates, they can opt in.""
Many Republicans, Kemp and Trump included, have framed mask mandates as a violation of personal liberty -- an imposition on individuals and businesses alike. It is an attitude that puts a hard limit on governmental responsibility, even at the most local level. And that is a source of frustration for many.
Suppose you flip the script. Ask yourself whether you, as a consumer, have a right to know whether a business is doing the right thing -- before you and your family walk through the door.
On Monday, before Democrats pontificated and Governor Kemp explained, I had a conversation with state Rep. Chuck Efstration, R-Dacula. He faces Democrat Nakita Hemingway in November.
You'll remember Efstration as author of the hate crimes bill that was signed into law in June. He is a Republican in search of a more middling way, and has floated a three-point coronavirus package.
It's aimed at those ""who are interested in asking what else can government do in this crisis,"" Efstration said.
His first proposal: The building of an alliance of business and government that can distribute same-day testing for the coronavirus as soon as it becomes available. ""I really view testing with same-day results as the cornerstone of getting Georgians the information they need,"" Efstration said.
If there's a steep price, the state needs to pony up. ""Whatever the expense,"" were his exact words.
Secondly, Efstration wants ""learning centers"" to help working parents trapped between the viral exposure that in-person schooling represents, and the inability to supervise virtual learning at home.
Parents with money are forming ""pods"" -- small groups of socially distant students. The state needs to help working families of lesser means do the same -- in safe spaces that follow CDC guidelines. Especially where virtual learning is the only option.
Yes, this too would cost money. But it would also keep more people at their jobs.
Lastly, Efstration would create a state certification for businesses that comply with COVID-19 guidelines. Don't want to mask up? Fine. Enjoy your freedom. This would be a registry for businesses that do.
""Until customers feel safe using those businesses, it will be difficult for our economy to get back to what we need it to be,"" Efstration said. Such a registry would let consumers know who the good actors are.
Efstration said he has discussed coronavirus policy in general with Kemp staffers but has avoided specifics.
Early this month, the governor served notice that he intends to call a special session of the General Assembly. Kemp has not set a date, nor set the parameters for legislation to be considered.
Efstration would like to see language in the governor's ""call"" to allow an airing of his ideas. Preferably before November."

In it, he details some changes he wants to see to fight racism. He writes:From the moment I launched my campaign, I have said that we are in the battle for thesoul of this nation[2]. And after two weeks of daily protests, with thousands of people coming out to march for racial justice in the midst of a pandemic, with gatherings in all 50 states and the District of Columbia and in communities of every size, the American people have shown the world exactly where we stand in this battle.We know the nation we want to be. 
Now we have to deliver on this moment to achieve fundamental changes that address racial inequalities and white supremacy in our country.President Donald Trump's hate-filled, conspiracy-laden rhetoric is inflaming the racial divides in our country, but just fixing the way the president talks won't cut it. We need to root out systemic racism across our laws and institutions, and we need to make sure black Americans have a real shot to get ahead.For too long, black Americans have lived with a knee on their neck — not only institutional violence, but daily injustices like having the police called forsitting in a coffee shop[3]orwatching birds[4]in the park.I support the proposal pending in New York to enhance penalties for making afalse 911 call[5]based on race, gender or religion.No one should be subjected to that kind of discrimination, ever.We should also be directing our resources to actively undo the negative effect systemic racism has had on opportunities for black Americans. For example, African American entrepreneurs are rejected for loans at a ratenearly 20%higher[6]than white entrepreneurs,and when they do receive funding, it's far less. So we should prioritize support for mission-driven lenders in low-income communities by doubling theState Small Business Credit Initiative[7]. We should expand theNew Markets Tax Credit[8]to funnel billions in investments into communities that need it. And, the Small Business Administration should expand its programs that are most effective at helping launch black-owned businesses.For most Americans, home ownership is the key to financial stability and building generational wealth. Today, thegap between African American and white homeownership[9]is larger than it was in the late 1960s. We have to give local officials the tools to combat gentrification, end discriminatory lending practices, and eliminate exclusionary zoning laws designed to keep low-income people and people of color out of certain communities.President Trump has actively undermined progress on all these issues, includingsuspending[10]the Obama-Biden administration's rule on Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing, which required communities to proactively examine housing patterns and identify and address policies that have a discriminatory effect.We should be working with state, local and tribal school leaders, as well as the presidents of Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and Minority Serving Institutions to develop plans for improving teacher diversity, solving the student debt crisis, and investing in these historically-underfunded institutions that are critical to our national success.Across the board — from our classrooms to our courtrooms to the president's Cabinet — we have to make sure that our leadership and our institutions actually look like America.And, we must urgently address the abuse of power in police departments. I commend the leaders in the Democratic Party in Congress for proposing legislation that includesvital reforms[11]: banning chokeholds, ensuring prosecutors in police-involved killings are independent, collecting data regarding police use of force and violations of use of force standards, and requiring training for officers regarding racial and religious bias and their duty to intervene if another officer is abusing his or her power.If state and local governments fail to make necessary changes, the Department of Justice must have subpoena power for pattern or practice investigations into systemic misconduct by police departments and force these departments to reform.While I do not believe federal dollars should go to police departments that are violating people's rights or turning to violence as the first resort, I do not support defunding police. The better answer is to give police departments the resources they need to implement meaningful reforms, and to condition other federal dollars on completing those reforms.I've long been a firm believer in the power of community policing—getting cops out of their cruisers and building relationships with the people and the communities they are there to serve and protect. That's why I'm proposing an additional$300 million[12]to reinvigorate community policing in our country. Every single police department should have the money they need to institutereal reforms like adopting a national use of force standard, buying body cameras, and recruiting more diverse police officers.And, we need to prevent 911 calls in scenarios where police should not be our first responders. That means making serious investments in mental health services, drug treatment and prevention programs, and services for people experiencing homelessness. That may also mean having social service providers respond to calls with police officers.Nothing about this fight will be easy. Institutions resist change. Racism has been a fixture in our society for hundreds of years. It will take leadership at the highest levels of our government — and sustained grassroots pressure from communities who will no longer stand by silently when injustices are inflicted on people of color. And, vitally, it will require all of us to examine our own conduct, our deeply ingrained habits, and our own thinking.I'm ready to do that work, starting on day one. Nothing less is acceptable from an American president.

25,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1001/Files (250).DOCX","Impact News Service",2020-12-18,"487 words",NA,NA,NA,"Federal Court Strikes Down Ohio’s Anti-Transgender Birth Certificate Policy",FALSE,"New York: American Civil Liberties Union has issued the following press release:
The U.S District Court for the Southern District of Ohio today struck down a discriminatory state policy that prevented transgender people born in Ohio from correcting the gender marker on their birth certificates. The decision was issued in Ray v McCloud, the lawsuit filed more than two years ago by Lambda Legal, the American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Ohio, and Thompson Hine LLP on behalf of four plaintiffs Stacie Ray, Basil Argento, Ashley Breda, and Jane Doe.
“This is truly a victory for the LGBT community, in every aspect,” said Stacie Ray.
“Finally, transgender people from Ohio will be able to correct their birth certificates so that this necessary identity document is consistent with their gender identities,” said Kara Ingelhart, staff attorney at Lambda Legal. “Accurate birth certificates are essential. They are foundational to our ability to access a variety of benefits such as employment and housing, and to navigate the world freely and safely, as who we truly are. Courts across the country have overwhelmingly determined these archaic and harmful laws are unconstitutional and today we are closer than ever to eradicating them once and for all. ”
“Today’s ruling affirms that the state must recognize the dignity and true identity of every transgender Ohioan. It is incredibly frustrating that our clients faced years of unlawful discrimination, but today we celebrate this victory as an acknowledgement to their commitment to justice,” added Elizabeth Bonham, staff attorney for the ACLU of Ohio.
“Trans people are the experts on our own genders, lives, and needs. I’m thrilled that the court recognized that policies like Ohio’s, which misgender and endanger us, also violate the Constitution. We will keep fighting until we get rid of all discriminatory and burdensome requirements for ID changes around the country,” said Malita Picasso, Skadden Fellow, ACLU LGBT & HIV Project.
At the time of filing, Ohio was one of just three states, along with Tennessee and Kansas, that did not allow these corrections to be made. However, in June 2019, Kansas reached a consent agreement with Lambda Legal and the court ordered the state to start issuing corrected birth certificates, leaving just Ohio and Tennessee as the only two states with this harmful anti-transgender policy on the books. Per the ruling, Judge Watson writes, “All the Court is finding is that a blanket prohibition against transgender people changing their sex marker is unconstitutional. ”
According to the 2015 U.S Transgender Survey, almost one-third of transgender individuals who showed an identity document with a name or gender marker that conflicted with their perceived gender were harassed, denied benefits or services, discriminated against, or assaulted. Transgender individuals also are disproportionately targeted for hate crimes."

Joe Biden And The New World Order (NWO)",FALSE,"Jun 25, 2020( Conservative Daily News: http://conservativedailynews.com Delivered by Newstex) When President Trump first came into office he promised to drain the swamp and fight for the people which he is doing and succeeding magnificently. No president in history has succeeded more for the American people while having him and his family abused, defied, slandered, smeared and besmirched by his opponents yet he always manages to come back on top with a good right upper cut to his opponents. Now he faces re-election. A recent poll taken by the New York Slimes has Biden leading Trump by 14 points. 
JoeBiden[1]held a 50% to 36% lead over Trump[2], according to the New York Times/Siena Collegepoll[3]. Mr.Trump[4]was underwater on his overall approval rating, with a 41%/56% approve/disapprove split. Sixty-two percent of voters said they disapprove of how President Trump[5]is handling the protests following George Floyd's death last month, 61% said they disapprove of his handling of race relations, and 58% said they disapprove of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. I would like to ask these people who think Trump hasn't handled the coroanvirus and riots right, just what do they expect him to do? He offered military assistance to the governors of the states in turmoil and they refused help. Trump has done more than any of the dems who sat on their hands while he did everything to save the country from the virus. Lets take a good look at what he did to fight the virus: After the first death from the virus in late January when it was discovered it came from China,Trump put a halt from all travel to the U.S from China. After it broke out in Europe, Trump put a halt from all travel to the U.S. from Europe. Trump saved thousands of lives by these travel bans. When it broke out here, Trump gave Andrew Cuomo 40,000 ventilators he requested which Cuomo didn't need after he found he had a warehouse full of them he didn't know he had. Trump then stockpiled them for us and the leftovers he gave to countries who needed them. Trump got the two hospital ships Comfort and Mercy here in record time one on each coast. Trump turned the Javits Center in New York into a 3000 bed hospital for corona patients Trump got CEO's from various medical supply companies who make medical supplies including Mike Lindell from My Pillow fame to the white house to pledge giving support and much needed supplies such as ventilators, hospital gowns, masks and drugs where needed. Mike Lindell pledged to turn 75% of his company over to making masks, gowns and sheets for hospitals. Trump got the army to set up makeshift hospitals around the country for the overflow of patients. And where were the dems all this time? They were sitting on their hands plotting against Trump and thinking of new ways to impeach him while the country was dying. So I don't want people saying Trump isn't handling the pandemic. There are people in the government known as the deep state who want to get rid of Trump so bad and gain control that they don't care how many people die in the process. I don't believe these polls anyway especially one from the New York Slimes. Why would anyone want to vote for a creepy, old, forgetful, mumbling senile man staying in his basement. Sounds like something out of a horror movie. The only reason they hate Trump so much is because of the leftist lies from the media.(Article Continues Below Advertisement) Joe Biden is not winning in any poles against Trump. He has no platform to run on, only knows all about the walls in his basement, he doesn't come out to campaign (like Hillary did) so what are the supposed people voting on? We've already experienced lying poles in the 2016 election. This time, whoever believes them deserves the Medal of Stupidity. If God forbid, Biden got in he'll not be running the country but those around him will. They will just pop his face up when needed to make it appear he is in charge. People have two choices in this election.Their job is to vote for the best of those two who will get things done. Will they vote for the highly corrupt dementia guy hiding in the basement or the energetic guy who is out in the trenches daily fighting for us,and putting his andhis family's life at risk for our safety? They have to use theirminds not their emotions. Those are their only choices. Just compare the two; lower taxes, safety, jobs, and history of Trump and his business and then Biden with his criminal activity for 40 years. Trump has hired more minorities and women than anyone thinks. A recent article in Breitbart explained the lefts and rioters goals clearly: 'The modern left's goals, the modern media's goals, the goals of the terrorists in Antifa and Black Lives Matter are immoral, are the authoritarian goals of tyrants who want to tell us how to think and what to believe, what we can and cannot say They want total control of our children by way of a failed school system, they want total control of that which shapes our culture by way of an entertainment institution that blacklists those who think different, they want total control of political speech by means of tech fascists, and they want total control of our government by way of cheat-by-mail, removing the electoral college, killing the filibuster, and expanding the Supreme Court. The left are now the Woke Taliban, and the Woke Taliban cannot achieve those goals through non-violent protest and civil disobedience because those goals are monstrous. So they are forced, like the Bolsheviks before them, to resort to gangsterism and violence, to terror and lies. We now live in a world where Democrat politicians are doing nothing to stop the violence in their own cities, where the police are obviously being told to stand down as lawless mobs gleefully stream the statues they topple and monuments they desecrate, where a big city mayor sides with the terrorists who occupied six city blocks filled with hundreds of businesses and private residences. We now live in a world where violence against President Trump and his supporters isopenly encouraged[6]by the media.We now live in a world where aNew York Times'Pulitzer winnercelebrates[7]the idea she is the gasoline fueling the desecration of churches and decimation of black neighborhoods. This is all happening right now In America. And eventually a Democrat president and congress will agree that Mount Rushmore needs to come down, or needs to be returned to the Indians who will then dynamite it, or we will one day see a group of these left-wing terrorists succeed in dynamiting it. There is one way to stop it Only one Come 2020, the American people must repudiate this terrorism at the ballot box, must annihilate the Democrats in such an overwhelming way it will be 50 years before they resort to violence again (remember, it was 50 years ago Democrats used violence to try and preserve the Jim Crow south)But that's the only way, and the polls right now are not encouraging. We have already been heavily infiltrated by NWO/Globalists/Deep State, in most areas in our lives. All causes or crises people protestfor now,are suspect as being infiltrated by NWO. It is simply one vehicle NWO uses to divide&#38; conquer, in its goal of world domination. The 'Protesters/Rioters' think they are being supported for their cause, but it'sNWO using them as their useful idiots.There are no causes. NWO's only goal now is to bring down Trump in any way they can. They USE causes. They want to install a puppet idiot president and themselves in control,not the dumb Dems. That's all what's really going on now is all about. Nothing else. So who are these NOW globalists you may ask? Here are but the handful of NWO members: George Soros, The Clintons, Obama, Bill Gates Foundation, Dr. Fauci, Dr. Birxx, WHO (WORLD HEALTH ORG.) our CDC (Center for Disease Control, headquartered in Atlanta) , NIH, Socialist Democratic Party, Bushes, to name a few. Obviously more names we arefamiliar with are members, but they are not public figures and don't go around advertising themselves as such. You don't hear from them, but are the movers and shakers behind the scene like Rockefellers and Rothschilds.David Vaughan Icke is an English conspiracy theorist, and a former footballer and sports broadcaster. Icke has written more than 20 books and claims that all these riots and thuggery and tearing down statues has had many reasons why it's happening nowIs it to Divert Attention from what's just happened - 'It is all a Diversion by the NWO' he says. They've come a long way. NWO wants to destroy and erase our culture, our history, our governing laws, our religions and their teachings and their churches - even people worshipping a white Jesus are considered racists. They want tototallyclean houseso they can install their New World Order, ruled by a handful of the richest people in history from various countries, and have a drastically reduced world population that they use as their slaves. Soon those too will be changed, perhaps replaced with AI.'All our freedoms and advancements could be wiped out by one dishonest election. It is only the NWO closing in on us. Their biggest, most formidable obstacle isTRUMP. With elections only a few months away, they are under extremepressure (UNHINGED!) to destroyeverything our country stands for, and install their New World Order Headquarters.Do you think our upcoming election is an important one?Wake up Right!

This article is part of Overlooked, a series of obituaries about remarkable people whose deaths, beginning in 1851, went unreported in The Times.
Barbara Waxman Fiduccia took pride in her identity as a disabled woman. Her stylish dress, whether a kimono-sleeved jacket, a leather miniskirt or leopard-print shoes, was more than an expression of personal taste. To Fiduccia, a reproductive rights activist who used a ventilator and maneuvered her wheelchair with a sort of regal command, her clothing was part of a political statement, a demand to be seen in full.
“She loved her body,” said Alice Wong, an activist and author who was a member of the National Council on Disability during the Obama administration, and who looked to Fiduccia as a role model. “She was an unapologetically sexual disabled woman — unapologetic about her politics and the way she lived her life.”
Fiduccia was among the first to campaign openly for reproductive rights for people with disabilities. In trenchant essays and policy papers, she challenged a dominant culture that viewed people with disabilities as asexual beings, with no feelings of intimacy or desire to have children.
These attitudes, she said, were translated into public policies that discouraged disabled couples from marrying and having families, and that created barriers that prevented them from enjoying sexually fulfilling lives.
In her 15 years as a sexual health educator and counselor in Los Angeles, Fiduccia regularly saw clients who experienced self-loathing and sexual loneliness — a consequence, she said, of internalized cultural notions.
She pushed to broaden the disability rights movement beyond physical access to transportation, public buildings, schools and places of employment. Disabled people, she wrote in a 1991 essay, are “concerned with being loved and finding sexual fulfillment.”
“Why hasn’t our movement politicized our sexual oppression as we do transportation and attendant services?” she wrote in the essay, which was published in The Disability Rag, a magazine devoted to disability issues. “I believe we don’t speak out because we believe we are ultimately to blame for not getting laid — that it is somehow a personal inferiority.”
Her message was empowering.
“She believed that denying your sexuality was denying your personhood,” Corbett Joan O’Toole, a disability rights activist and owner of Reclamation Press, a publisher of books by authors with disabilities, said in a phone interview. “She came from the place of a woman in an electric wheelchair, speaking for people who were taught to be ashamed of who they are.”
Fiduccia pushed for increased access to reproductive services, including mammograms and pelvic exams. She and others successfully lobbied to expand the national Hate Crime Statistics Act to include violence against people with disabilities. She also served on the California attorney general’s Civil Rights Commission on Hate Crimes.
With her future husband, Daniel Fiduccia, a legal affairs consultant she met at a 1992 training session for disability advocates, she fought to raise the income limit for federal health benefits, which stood in the way of marriage for disabled couples. Daniel Fiduccia was a survivor of childhood cancer, and his mobility was limited from radiation treatments that had weakened his bones.
Under federal health limits, Barbara Fiduccia’s salary as a single woman was low enough for Medicare and Medicaid to cover the cost of her personal attendants and ventilator. But the couple’s combined income was over the limit, forcing them to choose between marriage and the health benefits that helped keep Barbara Fiduccia alive. Her dilemma, she told The San Jose Mercury News in 1995, felt “like a dirty joke.”
“I was told in so many ways as a girl that I’d always be alone,” she told the newspaper. Instead, she said, she found “tremendous love and passion” with a man who wanted to spend his life with her.
“I got over the stigma,” she said, “and now I can’t get married.”
Her ventilator strapped to the back of her wheelchair, Barbara Fiduccia made the rounds on Capitol Hill, advocating alongside other disability activists, while Daniel Fiduccia helped map out a legal strategy. Although Congress did not eliminate the so-called marriage penalty, the rules were changed in the mid-1990s to allow states to grant waivers to individual couples.
“They wanted to be married, and this was their one shot,” Marsha Saxton, director of research and training at the World Institute on Disability in Oakland, Calif., and a friend of Barbara Fiduccia, said in a phone interview. “But they also wanted to change policy.”
The couple married in July 1996 in a small Roman Catholic service near their home in Cupertino, Calif., said Rick Santina, a family friend who attended. They were fond of children, though they had none of their own. Santina said his children came to know Barbara Fiduccia as “Aunt Beep” because she let them blast the horn on her wheelchair as she gave them rides on her lap.
Barbara Faye Waxman was born in Los Angeles on April 1, 1955, the younger of two children of Sol Waxman, owner of a commercial photography lab, and Toby (Lowsky) Waxman. She and her brother, Michael, had spinal muscular atrophy, an inherited disorder that causes progressive muscle weakness. Her parents were told she would not live past 30.
Because she could walk as a child, albeit with difficulty, her parents wrestled with whether to enroll her in special education classes, where she was more likely to make friends, or in regular public school classes, where she would receive a better education. They chose the latter, an environment Fiduccia described years later as “psychologically damaging.”
During recess in grade school, a teacher routinely admonished her to run, though young Barbara was incapable of doing so. In high school, she tripped almost daily on an uneven carpet as her math teacher walked past her, staring.
“In those 12 years, though they never spoke of it, I believe it was my disability they saw, while forgetting it was a child who possessed it,” she said.
After receiving her bachelor’s degree in psychology from California State University, Northridge, in 1978, Fiduccia went to work at Planned Parenthood in Los Angeles as a health educator and disability project coordinator. Clients told her that gynecologists, like her former teachers, often focused on their disabilities instead of on their reproductive health needs.
“I know of many times when a woman has been sent back to her orthopedist for a Pap smear,” she said in her 1985 testimony before a congressional committee exploring changes to Title IX, which bars gender discrimination at institutions receiving federal funding.
But Fiduccia eventually left Planned Parenthood, pained by what she called a “strong eugenics mentality that established disdain, discomfort and ignorance toward disabled babies.”
She cringed whenever her co-workers discussed prenatal testing and the need to abort a disabled fetus. “There was a feeling that there were bad babies,” she told The New York Times in 1991.
Fiduccia then worked at the Los Angeles Regional Family Planning Council, an umbrella organization for more than 100 clinics, where she continued her focus on reproductive health for women with disabilities. After that, she served as senior associate at the Center for Women Policy Studies, a feminist policy research organization.
Her husband, an advocate for childhood cancer survivors, died after a recurrence of cancer in 2001. Fiduccia herself died 18 days later, on April 24, when her ventilator equipment failed. She was 46.
A year after their marriage, the Fiduccias renewed their vows in a Jewish service in Los Angeles. Surrounded by hundreds of guests, the couple made their way, hand in hand, across a terrace toward a huppah, he in his scooter and she in her wheelchair, which she rode, her friend Marsha Saxton said, “like a queen on a steed.” Under the wedding canopy, in keeping with Jewish tradition, she circled the groom seven times.
Fiduccia’s dress, Saxton said, was “full of life,” a statement of triumph in bronze and teal.
After the dinner, the Fiduccias took to the dance floor, which was covered in bubble wrap that joyously popped as their wheels rolled over it. Soon guests in wheelchairs joined them on the floor; others looked on, waiving light sticks. The celebration ended with fireworks, an explosion of color against the night sky.

30,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1001/Files (250).DOCX","Targeted News Service",2020-06-10,"907 words",NA,"Targeted News Service",NA,"Sen. Gillibrand Highlights Bicameral Plan to Hold Police Accountable, Increase Transparency",FALSE,"Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, issued the following news release:
U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand highlighted a bicameral plan to hold police accountable for misconduct, address systemic racism in police practices, improve transparency, make lynching a federal crime, and institute other police reform measures. Following Gillibrand's introduction of the Eric Garner Excessive Force Prevention Act -- the Senate companion to Representative Hakeem Jeffries' (D-NY) legislation that was introduced following the death of Eric Garner in 2014 -- the bicameral policing reform package includes a provision to ban chokeholds and make the use of maneuvers that restrict oxygen intake or blood flow to the brain by law enforcement a federal civil rights violation. The push comes as people across the nation and globe protest police brutality and institutional racism, following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Floyd, an unarmed African-American man, was subdued by four officers, including one who knelt on his neck for nine minutes as he repeated, ""I can't breathe.""
""The deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and countless others are deeply disturbing, and have brought our country to a moment of moral reckoning. We cannot allow for this systemic racism and brutality to continue -- we must act,"" said Senator Gillibrand. ""While we cannot repair the damage done by these horrific killings, this legislation would make crucial, and much-needed changes to our nation's policing practices and policies. I'm proud to cosponsor this legislation led by my dear friends, Senators Booker and Harris. I will use my voice to support calls for policing reform and accountability, and I will continue fighting alongside my colleagues in Congress to put an end to these tragedies.""
Recent deaths of unarmed black Americans at the hands of police -- including Breonna Taylor, who was murdered by an officer in Louisville, KY on an incorrect no-knock warrant, George Floyd, and countless others -- have sparked nationwide and global protests against police brutality and institutional racism. According to the Washington Post's Deadly Force Database, police have shot and killed more than 1,000 people in the United States over the past year. While black Americans account for less than 13% of the U.S. population, reports show they are killed by police more than twice as often as white Americans. The overwhelming majority of police officers involved in civilian deaths have not been charged or convicted of a crime.
The Justice in Policing Act of 2020 proposes sweeping reforms to policing in America to address systemic issues and lack of accountability. The bicameral legislation, which was introduced by Senators Booker and Harris, House Democratic Leadership, and the Congressional Black Caucus, would create a strong police accountability framework by redefining police misconduct, prohibiting no knock warrants in drug cases, making the use of chokeholds a federal civil rights violation, and addressing militarization of the police force. Specifically, the Justice in Policing Act of 2020 would:
* Hold police accountable in our courts:
- Make it easier to prosecute police misconduct at the federal level by changing the federal criminal statute from a ""willfulness"" to a ""recklessness"" standard
- Reform qualified immunity so that individuals are able to recover damages when police violate their constitutional rights;
- Improve the use of pattern and practice investigations into agencies who use discriminatory and unconstitutional policing practices, and independent investigations at the federal level
- Provide new federal funds to State AGs to conduct pattern and practice investigations and to establish independent investigative bodies for police involved deaths
* Improve transparency in policing:
- Create a National Police Misconduct Registry to prevent problem-officers from changing jurisdictions to avoid accountability; and
- Require state and local law enforcement agencies report use of force data, disaggregated by race, sex, disability, religion, age.
- Improve police training and practices:
- End racial and religious profiling, and mandates training on racial bias and the duty to intervene;
- Ban no-knock warrants in drug cases;
- Ban chokeholds and carotid artery holds through federal funding requirements and designates these maneuvers as a federal civil rights violation;
- Change the standard to evaluate whether law enforcement use of force was justified from whether the force was reasonable to whether the force was necessary;
- Limit the transfer of military-grade equipment to state and local law enforcement;
- Require federal uniformed police officers to wear body cameras; and
- Require state and local law enforcement to use existing federal funds to ensure the use of police body cameras.
* Establish lynching as a federal crime to conspire to violate existing federal hate crimes laws.
The legislation has been endorsed by leading civil rights organizations including the National Coalition of Black Civic Participation, Black Women's Roundtable, Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, National Urban League, and National Action Network.

· What is it with liberals and Hollywood types and blackface? Now the NBC hit ""30 Rock"" is memory-holing four episodes that featured white characters in blackface:
Four episodes of 30 Rock, including two featuring Jane Krakowski's Jenna character in blackface, are being removed from subscription streaming services Hulu and Amazon Prime and have also been made unavailable for sale on purchase platforms such as iTunes and Google Play. The episodes, which will no longer air on traditional TV either, were pulled at the request of NBCUniversal executive producers Tina Fey and Robert Carlock. A source tells Vulture the four episodes, some of which have already vanished, should be gone by the end of this week.
But wait, there's more!
Mary Poppins Branded 'Racist' by US Academic Over Soot Scene
An American academic has criticised Mary Poppins for projecting racial stereotypes, saying Dame Julie Andrews's character wears ""blackface"" during one scene.
Writing for The New York Times, Professor Daniel Pollack-Pelzner - a gender studies professor at Linfield College, Oregon - sharply criticises the scene where Mary Poppins joins Dick Van Dyke's chimneysweep Bert to dance on a rooftop. The pair both get covered in soot as the dance number ""Step in Time"" is performed.
Pollack-Pelzner says that, while the scene may be comic, the author of the Mary Poppins books, PL Travers, often associated chimney sweeps' blackened faces with racial caricatures.
Wait till Prof. Pollack-Pelzner discovers what auto mechanics look like after they've worked under a car for a couple hours. Nooses will be the least of NASCAR's worries.
· Speaking of Fake Noose, Bubba Wallace at first doubled-down on the NASCAR noose scare, before gracefully backing down on Twitter this morning:
But this is not the only loose noose panic of the last week. Out in Oakland, a series of nooses were spotted at Lake Merritt Park, and set off a full-scale hate crime crusade. That is, until the black person who put them up for exercise purposes several months ago stepped forward:
OAKLAND - Oakland's mayor said five ropes found hanging from trees in a city park are nooses and racially-charged symbols of terror but a resident said they are merely exercise equipment that he put up there months ago.
Mayor Libby Schaaf said Wedesday that a hate crime investigation was under way after a social media post identified a noose at the city's popular Lake Merritt. Police said they searched the area on Tuesday and found five ropes attached to trees. . .
Victor Sengbe, who is black, told KGO-TV that the ropes were part of a rigging that he and his friends used as part of a larger swing system. He also shared video of the swing in use.
""Out of the dozen and hundreds and thousands of people that walked by, no one has thought that it looked anywhere close to a noose. Folks have used it for exercise. It was really a fun addition to the park that we tried to create,"" Sengbe said.
""It's unfortunate that a genuine gesture of just wanting to have a good time got misinterpreted into something so heinous,"" he told the station.
Of course, Oakland's politicians can't back down:
[Oakland Mayor Libby] Schaaf said officials must ""start with the assumption that these are hate crimes."" However, the mayor and Nicholas Williams, the city's director of parks recreation, also said it didn't matter whether the ropes were meant to send a racist message.
""Intentions don't matter when it comes to terrorizing the public,"" Schaaf said. ""It is incumbent on all of us to know the actual history of racial violence, of terrorism, that a noose represents and that we as a city must remove these terrorizing symbols from the public view.""
""The symbolism of the rope hanging in the tree is malicious regardless of intent. It's evil, and it symbolizes hatred,"" Williams said.
Pretty clear what the end point is going to be: tying any rope into a loop, no matter whether for use in rigging a sail on a boat or making a garage roll-up door pull, must be banned and never taught by the Boy Scouts or anyone else ever again.
By the way, is relevant that Oakland's mayor is white?
· By far the craziest story of the day comes from John and Scott's backyard in Minneapolis, where the New York Times has a story about a neighborhood that decided to open itself up to the homeless, and further resolved not to call the police in the event of any trouble. And you'll never guess what happened next! You have to read it, not to believe it. For those of you without access to the Times, here are a few highlights from this long feature:
After the death of George Floyd at the hands of the police, Ms. Albers, who is white, and many of her progressive neighbors have vowed to avoid calling law enforcement into their community. Doing so, they believed, would add to the pain that black residents of Minneapolis were feeling and could put them in danger.
Already, that commitment is being challenged. Two weeks ago, dozens of multicolored tents appeared in the neighborhood park. They were brought by homeless people who were displaced during the unrest that gripped the city. The multiracial group of roughly 300 new residents seems to grow larger and more entrenched every day. They do laundry, listen to music and strategize about how to find permanent housing. Some are hampered by mental illness, addiction or both.
Their presence has drawn heavy car traffic into the neighborhood, some from drug dealers. At least two residents have overdosed in the encampment and had to be taken away in ambulances.
I'll bet this is just great for property values and home sales in the neighborhood. More:
In the city where the movement began, residents are not surprised that it is being taken especially seriously in Powderhorn Park, just blocks from Mr. Floyd's deadly encounter with the police. For decades, the community has been a refuge for scrappy working-class activists with far-left politics. The biggest day of the year, locals often boast, is the May Day parade celebrating laborers. . .
But many in the neighborhood, who were already beleaguered from the financial stresses of the coronavirus, now say they are eager for the campers to move on to stable housing away from the park.
""I'm not being judgmental,"" said Carrie Nightshade, 44, who explained that she no longer felt comfortable letting her children, 12 and 9, play in the park by themselves. ""It's not personal. It's just not safe.""
That sounds pretty judgmental to me.
Angelina Roslik burst into tears, explaining that she had spent the past four years fleeing unstable housing conditions and was struggling more than she cared to admit with the chaos the camp had brought into the neighborhood. Linnea Borden said she had stopped walking her dog through the park because she was tired of being catcalled. . .
The impulse many white Powderhorn Park residents have to seek help from community groups rather than from the police is being felt in neighborhoods across the country. But some are finding the commitment hard to stand by when faced with the complex realities of life.
""Faced with the complex realities of life."" You have permission to laugh out loud now.
But the last story in the article sounds ripped right from the pages of a Tom Wolfe novel:
Mitchell Erickson's fingers began dialing 911 last week before he had a chance to even consider alternatives, when two black teenagers who looked to be 15, at most, cornered him outside his home a block away from the park.
One of the boys pointed a gun at Mr. Erickson's chest, demanding his car keys.
Flustered, Mr. Erickson handed over a set, but it turned out to be house keys. The teenagers got frustrated and ran off, then stole a different car down the street.
Mr. Erickson said later that he would not cooperate with prosecutors in a case against the boys. After the altercation, he realized that if there was anything he wanted, it was to offer them help. But he still felt it had been right to call the authorities because there was a gun involved.
Two days after an initial conversation, his position had evolved. ""Been thinking more about it,"" he wrote in a text message. ""I regret calling the police. It was my instinct but I wish it hadn't been. I put those boys in danger of death by calling the cops.""

This article is part of Overlooked, a series of obituaries about remarkable people whose deaths, beginning in 1851, went unreported in The Times. 
 Barbara Waxman Fiduccia took pride in her identity as a disabled woman. Her stylish dress, whether a kimono-sleeved jacket, a leather miniskirt or leopard-print shoes, was more than an expression of personal taste. To Fiduccia, a reproductive rights activist who used a ventilator and maneuvered her wheelchair with a sort of regal command, her clothing was part of a political statement, a demand to be seen in full.
 ''She loved her body,'' said Alice Wong, an activist and author who was a member of the National Council on Disability during the Obama administration, and who looked to Fiduccia as a role model. ''She was an unapologetically sexual disabled woman -- unapologetic about her politics and the way she lived her life.''
 Fiduccia was among the first to campaign openly for reproductive rights for people with disabilities. In trenchant essays and policy papers, she challenged a dominant culture that viewed people with disabilities as asexual beings, with no feelings of intimacy or desire to have children.
 These attitudes, she said, were translated into public policies that discouraged disabled couples from marrying and having families, and that created barriers that prevented them from enjoying sexually fulfilling lives.
 In her 15 years as a sexual health educator and counselor in Los Angeles, Fiduccia regularly saw clients who experienced self-loathing and sexual loneliness -- a consequence, she said, of internalized cultural notions.
 She pushed to broaden the disability rights movement beyond physical access to transportation, public buildings, schools and places of employment. Disabled people, she wrote in a 1991 essay, are ''concerned with being loved and finding sexual fulfillment.''
 ''Why hasn't our movement politicized our sexual oppression as we do transportation and attendant services?'' she wrote in the essay, which was published in The Disability Rag, a magazine devoted to disability issues. ''I believe we don't speak out because we believe we are ultimately to blame for not getting laid -- that it is somehow a personal inferiority.''
 Her message was empowering.
 ''She believed that denying your sexuality was denying your personhood,'' Corbett Joan O'Toole, a disability rights activist and owner of Reclamation Press, a publisher of books by authors with disabilities, said in a phone interview. ''She came from the place of a woman in an electric wheelchair, speaking for people who were taught to be ashamed of who they are.''
 Fiduccia pushed for increased access to reproductive services, including mammograms and pelvic exams. She and others successfully lobbied to expand the national Hate Crime Statistics Act to include violence against people with disabilities. She also served on the California attorney general's Civil Rights Commission on Hate Crimes.
 With her future husband, Daniel Fiduccia, a legal affairs consultant she met at a 1992 training session for disability advocates, she fought to raise the income limit for federal health benefits, which stood in the way of marriage for disabled couples. Daniel Fiduccia was a survivor of childhood cancer, and his mobility was limited from radiation treatments that had weakened his bones.
 Under federal health limits, Barbara Fiduccia's salary as a single woman was low enough for Medicare and Medicaid to cover the cost of her personal attendants and ventilator. But the couple's combined income was over the limit, forcing them to choose between marriage and the health benefits that helped keep Barbara Fiduccia alive. Her dilemma, she told The San Jose Mercury News in 1995, felt ''like a dirty joke.''
 ''I was told in so many ways as a girl that I'd always be alone,'' she told the newspaper. Instead, she said, she found ''tremendous love and passion'' with a man who wanted to spend his life with her.
 ''I got over the stigma,'' she said, ''and now I can't get married.''
 Her ventilator strapped to the back of her wheelchair, Barbara Fiduccia made the rounds on Capitol Hill, advocating alongside other disability activists, while Daniel Fiduccia helped map out a legal strategy. Although Congress did not eliminate the so-called marriage penalty, the rules were changed in the mid-1990s to allow states to grant waivers to individual couples.
 ''They wanted to be married, and this was their one shot,'' Marsha Saxton, director of research and training at the World Institute on Disability in Oakland, Calif., and a friend of Barbara Fiduccia, said in a phone interview. ''But they also wanted to change policy.''
 The couple married in July 1996 in a small Roman Catholic service near their home in Cupertino, Calif., said Rick Santina, a family friend who attended. They were fond of children, though they had none of their own. Santina said his children came to know Barbara Fiduccia as ''Aunt Beep'' because she let them blast the horn on her wheelchair as she gave them rides on her lap.
 Barbara Faye Waxman was born in Los Angeles on April 1, 1955, the younger of two children of Sol Waxman, owner of a commercial photography lab, and Toby (Lowsky) Waxman. She and her brother, Michael, had spinal muscular atrophy, an inherited disorder that causes progressive muscle weakness. Her parents were told she would not live past 30.
 Because she could walk as a child, albeit with difficulty, her parents wrestled with whether to enroll her in special education classes, where she was more likely to make friends, or in regular public school classes, where she would receive a better education. They chose the latter, an environment Fiduccia described years later as ''psychologically damaging.''
 During recess in grade school, a teacher routinely admonished her to run, though young Barbara was incapable of doing so. In high school, she tripped almost daily on an uneven carpet as her math teacher walked past her, staring.
 ''In those 12 years, though they never spoke of it, I believe it was my disability they saw, while forgetting it was a child who possessed it,'' she said.
 After receiving her bachelor's degree in psychology from California State University, Northridge, in 1978, Fiduccia went to work at Planned Parenthood in Los Angeles as a health educator and disability project coordinator. Clients told her that gynecologists, like her former teachers, often focused on their disabilities instead of on their reproductive health needs.
 ''I know of many times when a woman has been sent back to her orthopedist for a Pap smear,'' she said in her 1985 testimony before a congressional committee exploring changes to Title IX, which bars gender discrimination at institutions receiving federal funding.
 But Fiduccia eventually left Planned Parenthood, pained by what she called a ''strong eugenics mentality that established disdain, discomfort and ignorance toward disabled babies.''
 She cringed whenever her co-workers discussed prenatal testing and the need to abort a disabled fetus. ''There was a feeling that there were bad babies,'' she told The New York Times in 1991.
 Fiduccia then worked at the Los Angeles Regional Family Planning Council, an umbrella organization for more than 100 clinics, where she continued her focus on reproductive health for women with disabilities. After that, she served as senior associate at the Center for Women Policy Studies, a feminist policy research organization.
 Her husband, an advocate for childhood cancer survivors, died after a recurrence of cancer in 2001. Fiduccia herself died 18 days later, on April 24, when her ventilator equipment failed. She was 46.
 A year after their marriage, the Fiduccias renewed their vows in a Jewish service in Los Angeles. Surrounded by hundreds of guests, the couple made their way, hand in hand, across a terrace toward a huppah, he in his scooter and she in her wheelchair, which she rode, her friend Marsha Saxton said, ''like a queen on a steed.'' Under the wedding canopy, in keeping with Jewish tradition, she circled the groom seven times.
 Fiduccia's dress, Saxton said, was ''full of life,'' a statement of triumph in bronze and teal.
 After the dinner, the Fiduccias took to the dance floor, which was covered in bubble wrap that joyously popped as their wheels rolled over it. Soon guests in wheelchairs joined them on the floor; others looked on, waiving light sticks. The celebration ended with fireworks, an explosion of color against the night sky.

This briefing has ended. Click here for the latest updates.
Protests continue nationwide, with signs of an ebb after dark. 
Two weeks after George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis, demonstrations against police violence continued to fill the streets of cities and towns across the country on Monday. 
About 1,000 protesters gathered in Los Angeles near a memorial for those killed by the police. Thousands more called for police reforms before a City Council meeting in Charlotte, N.C. And more than 1,000 made their way to a march that began in Washington Square Park in Manhattan.
“This is a young, young revolution,” said Vidal Guzman, 29, as he led marchers down Fifth Avenue in New York. “These are teenagers, people in their 20s, 30-year-olds. We have energy. We believe in what we’re doing, and we’re not going to let up.”
[Read more on the life of George Floyd.]
Still, there were signs in parts of the country that the demonstrations that have raged through cities after dark over the past two weeks appeared to be ramping down in many places. 
By Monday night in Washington, after more than 40,000 people descended on the nation’s capital over the weekend, the city — for the most part — was quiet. The mouth of Lafayette Square, just yards from the White House, which had been a focal point for days of protests, was more a place of tribute than raised voices.
The black chain-link fence erected last week to keep protesters out had been adorned with flowers and flags, signs and posters. “Stop killing us,” one read. Another: “I am not a threat.” 
Geoff Thiel, 24, of Washington, was still in the park after arriving on Tuesday to hand out food and water from the back of a dilapidated white Volvo. Now, he and other volunteers had a tent, foldout tables and a significantly larger inventory.
Mr. Thiel opted to measure the crowd size by water bottles distributed. On Saturday: well over a thousand. Monday, he said, “just a few hundred.”
Still, with the economic devastation caused by the coronavirus giving people plenty of time to participate, activists vowed not to lose visibility or momentum. And it seemed it might only take another incident of police violence, like those seen during demonstrations across the country in recent weeks, to renew the rage.
“I’ll come out day after day after day,” said Andrew Jackson, a 25-year-old government contractor who said his own experiences of police abuse had compelled him to cut back on his work hours and join rallies in Washington. 
While city streets have calmed throughout much of the country, the Pacific Northwest has continued to see tense nightly standoffs between demonstrators and the police. On Monday, demonstrators in Portland, Ore., began their latest march by shutting down Interstate 84, while those in Seattle moved barricades in the city’s Capitol Hill neighborhood to create a protected space.
The persistent pressure from demonstrators has stirred further change in police departments. In Portland, Chief Jami Resch announced Monday that she was stepping down, saying new leadership was needed to help rebuild trust. In Seattle, police officers abandoned and boarded up their East Precinct building, which has been the center of demonstrations in the city.
Both cities have vowed to limit their use of tear gas, although at a protest that lasted from Sunday night into Monday morning, the police in Seattle still ended up discharging it, saying they were being targeted with projectiles. Two City Council members have called on Seattle’s mayor, Jenny Durkan, to resign.
Democrats in Congress unveil a bill to rein in bias and excessive force in policing.
Democratic lawmakers in Congress introduced legislation on Monday aimed at ending excessive use of force by police officers across the country, and making it easier to identify, track and prosecute police misconduct. 
The bill was introduced as a direct response to the recent killings of unarmed black Americans by police officers, as protests against police violence and racial discrimination continue across the country. It is the most expansive intervention into policing that lawmakers have proposed in recent memory.
The measure would curtail existing legal protections that shield police officers who are accused of misconduct from being prosecuted, and would impose new restrictions to prevent law enforcement officers from using deadly force, except as a last resort. It includes many proposals that civil rights activists have been pushing for decades against opposition from police unions and law enforcement groups.
“Never again should the world be subjected to witnessing what we saw on the streets in Minneapolis, the slow murder of an individual by a uniformed police officer,” said Representative Karen Bass, the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus. 
She was joined by Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the House Judiciary Committee chairman, and Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California in introducing the measure. 
Immediately beforehand, the four lawmakers joined with Democratic leaders to honor George Floyd, a black man who was killed while being arrested by Minneapolis police. They kneeled for 8 minutes 46 seconds, the length of time an officer pressed his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck.
Whether Democrats can seize the moment and push the changes into law remains unclear. They expect to pass the legislation swiftly in the Democratic-led House, but President Trump and Republican lawmakers who control the Senate have yet to signal which measures, if any, they would accept.
Mr. Trump has said little about the issue in recent days except to show his support for law and order on Twitter. In an interview with Fox News on Monday, Attorney General William P. Barr reiterated his view that police departments do not have a systemic problem with race.
Mr. Barr said that to draw conclusions about all police officers based on the actions of a few is akin to drawing conclusions about all black people based on negative stereotypes, which he called “one of the legitimate grievances of the African-American community.”
In the interview, Mr. Barr also contradicted Mr. Trump’s claim that he had visited a White House bunker for an inspection during the protests following Mr. Floyd’s death. “Things were so bad that the Secret Service recommended the president go down to the bunker,” Mr. Barr said. “We can’t have that in our country.”
Democrats in Congress will discuss their bill and hear testimony on police brutality and racial profiling at a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday. Among those set to testify is Philonise Floyd, a brother of George Floyd, according to a committee official familiar with the plans. The committee had yet to announce other witnesses.
Derek Chauvin appeared in court, where bail was set at up to $1.25 million.
Bail was set on Monday at up to $1.25 million for Derek Chauvin, the white former Minneapolis police officer charged with murder in the killing of George Floyd, a black man whose death in custody led to nationwide protests.
In the initial hearing in his case at the heavily fortified Hennepin County courthouse, the former officer, Derek Chauvin, a 19-year veteran of the police force, participated through a video feed from jail. Mr. Chauvin, who has been behind bars since he was arrested on May 29, faces charges of second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He faces up to 40 years in prison.
In a video that prompted anguish and outrage across the nation, Mr. Chauvin was seen pressing his knee on the neck of Mr. Floyd for nearly nine minutes. He has become a focus of global anger, referred to as the most hated man in the world. Activists said they were concerned that he would not abide by bail restrictions if he was permitted to go home while awaiting trial.
Mr. Chauvin’s bail would be $1 million if he agrees to certain conditions, including surrendering any firearms he has, remaining in the state until trial, not working in law enforcement and avoiding any contact with the Floyd family. 
The bail set for Mr. Chauvin is significantly higher than the bail of at least $750,000 given last week to the three other former officers accused of aiding and abetting in Mr. Floyd’s death.
A lawyer for Mr. Chauvin declined to comment.
Mr. Chauvin’s record at the police department was mixed. He was the subject of at least 17 misconduct complaints over two decades, according to a heavily redacted version of his personnel file that included no details on most of those complaints. He was also given at least two medals of valor. 
From Minneapolis to New York, cities are responding to cries to ‘defund the police.’
Two weeks after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, massive gatherings for racial justice around the country have achieved a scale and level of momentum not seen in decades — and they appear unlikely to run out anytime soon as a number of societal forces propel the movement forward.
Many people filling the streets say the economic devastation of the coronavirus had already cleared their schedules. With jobs lost and colleges shuttered, they have nothing but time. And aggressive responses by the police at protests are only reinforcing their commitment.
“You’re watching injustice take place in every sector of our society,” said Wes Moore, who chronicled the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore and its aftermath in the book “Five Days.” “Schools have been closed. Students are burdened and under debt. There’s a compounding to the pain.”
The sustained outcry has already led to stark promises for change in several cities, as calls to defund, downsize or abolish police departments gain new traction. 
In Minneapolis, where Mr. Floyd was killed on May 25, nine of 13 City Council members publicly promised on Sunday to dismantle the Police Department and create a new system of public safety. Though Mayor Jacob Frey has expressed reservations, the council members said they had enough votes to override any potential veto. 
In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio pledged to cut the city’s police budget and spend more on social services. The mayor did not say how much funding he planned to divert to social services from the New York Police Department, whose annual $6 billion budget represents more than 6 percent of Mr. de Blasio’s proposed $90 billion budget. 
Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles also announced last week that he would cut as much as $150 million from a planned increase in the Police Department’s budget.
Attorney General William P. Barr spoke against reducing police budgets in an interview with Fox News on Monday.
“I think defunding the police, holding the entire police structure responsible for the actions of certain officers, is wrong,” Mr. Barr said. “I think it is dangerous to demonize police.”
He called the nation’s 900,000 police officers “generally speaking excellent,” and said that the nation would see “chaos” and “more killings” should any major city disband its department. 
Biden says he’s against defunding the police.
Asked by CBS’s Norah O’Donnell on Monday if he supported defunding the police, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. answered: “No, I don’t support defunding the police. I support conditioning federal aid to police based on whether or not they meet certain basic standards of decency and honorableness.”
It was the first time Mr. Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, had weighed in on the growing calls for some existing police forces to be dismantled or pared down. 
His stance puts him at odds with some on the left of his party, who want to shrink police budgets and make radical changes in law enforcement. 
Earlier in the day, a Biden campaign spokesman, Andrew Bates, said Mr. Biden “hears and shares the deep grief and frustration of those calling out for change” and “supports the urgent need for reform.” But Mr. Bates emphasized that Mr. Biden believes providing funding is necessary to help improve policing, including by supporting “community policing programs that improve relationships between officers and residents.”
Mr. Biden traveled to Houston on Monday to meet with the family of George Floyd, whose killing in Minneapolis sparked widespread protests over police brutality and racism in America.
“Listening to one another is what will begin to heal America,” Benjamin Crump, the lawyer working with Mr. Floyd’s family, wrote on Twitter after the meeting. 
Minnesota police punctured tires, and a Philadelphia inspector who hit a student was cheered. 
Days of protests against police brutality have prompted numerous incidents of police misconduct, many of them captured on video and spread online. Now, more are coming to light.
The Minnesota state government acknowledged on Monday that Minneapolis police officers punctured the tires of parked cars near demonstrations in the city on May 30 and 31, saying that it was a legitimate police tactic because cars were being used to attack protesters and law enforcement officers.
Mother Jones reported the tire-slashing by the police on Saturday, with video clips of officers jabbing the tires of cars.
It was not clear how the officers chose which cars to disable, how many vehicles were affected, or whether those whose tires were slashed, including journalists, would be compensated.
In Philadelphia on Monday, a veteran police inspector who was seen on video beating a Temple University student in the head with a baton at a protest last week turned himself in, while dozens of officers turned out to applaud him in support. The police union, which condemned the charges as baseless, has been selling T-shirts to support the inspector.
Also on Monday, the Buffalo Police Department announced that it had suspended a civilian employee for a “reprehensible social media post.” Local media identified the employee as a police dispatcher who called protesters “wild animals” on Facebook and urged the city’s mayor to “allow the officers to shoot to kill.”
The suspension comes days after two Buffalo police officers in a riot control unit were charged with felony assault after a video showed them shoving a 75-year-old protester to the ground. In a gesture of support for their suspended colleagues, all 57 members of the unit quit the team, although they remained on the police force.
Prosecutors charge a man they say looted a burning police station in Minneapolis.
A 23-year-old man has been charged in connection with the fire that gutted a Minneapolis police station, after he was arrested while wearing gear stolen from the station, federal prosecutors said.
Branden M. Wolfe, of St. Paul, faces a charge of aiding and abetting arson on the night of May 28, when a protest over the death of George Floyd turned violent and the Third Precinct station was looted and burned.
Six days later, police officers in St. Paul arrested Mr. Wolfe after receiving a call of a man wearing body armor and wielding a police baton who was trying to get into a home improvement store. According to a statement from the United States attorney’s office in Minneapolis, store employees told the officers that Mr. Wolfe had worked there as a security guard, but had been fired that day after talking about stealing items from the police station.
“At the time of the arrest, Wolfe was wearing multiple items stolen from the Third Precinct, including body armor, a police-issue duty belt with handcuffs, an earphone piece, baton, and knife,” the statement said, adding that he had written his name in duct tape on the back of the body armor.
Officers later recovered other items of Minneapolis Police Department property from his apartment, the statement said, “including a riot helmet, 9mm pistol magazine, police radio, and police issue overdose kit.”
Mr. Wolfe admitted to law enforcement officers that he had taken items from the precinct station the night it was attacked, and had rolled a wooden barrel into a fire there to help keep it burning, the federal prosecutors said. They added that he also identified himself in multiple photos taken that night, showing him in front of the burning building, holding a police baton.
People drive into protests, including one man who says he’s a K.K.K. leader.
In separate incidents on Sunday near Richmond, Va., and in Seattle, people tried to drive their cars into demonstrations and were arrested, the authorities said — the latest in a series of similar attacks on people protesting the death of George Floyd.
The man who drove into a group of protesters in Virginia identified himself as a leader of the Ku Klux Klan, the authorities said, and prosecutors said they were investigating the episode as a possible hate crime.
“Several witnesses reported that a vehicle revved their engine and drove through the protesters occupying the roadway,” the Henrico County Police Division said in a statement.
The driver, Harry H. Rogers, 36, of Hanover County, Va., was arrested and charged with assault and battery, the police said. There were no reports of serious injuries, the police said.
“The accused, by his own admission and by a cursory glance at social media, is an admitted leader of the Ku Klux Klan and a propagandist for Confederate ideology,” said Shannon L. Taylor, the Commonwealth’s Attorney for Henrico County. “We are investigating whether hate crimes charges are appropriate.”
A lawyer for Mr. Rogers could not immediately be reached for comment. It was unclear whether Mr. Rogers’s claims about his membership in the Ku Klux Klan were true.
In the incident in Seattle, part of it captured on video, a man, whose name has not been released, drove into a group of protesters, some of whom pounded on his car. The man shot and wounded one demonstrator, got out of his car brandishing a gun, then left on foot through the crowd and surrendered to officers, the police said.
A man who drove through a group of demonstrators in Brooklyn over the weekend was also arrested.
IBM says it will stop supplying facial recognition software to police departments. 
IBM will no longer be a supplier of facial recognition technology used for surveillance by the police, Arvind Krishna, the company’s chief executive, wrote in a letter to Congress on Monday.
Mr. Krishna, who became IBM’s chief executive in April, portrayed the company’s position as a stand of principle and urged other technology companies to adopt the same policy. 
In his letter to Congress, Mr. Krishna said IBM “firmly opposes” the use of technology supplied by any company for mass surveillance or racial profiling.
The move by IBM is a significant symbolic step. The company has been active in facial recognition technology research as one branch of its work in the field of artificial intelligence. But it is not a major product for the company. 
Still, IBM has a long history of working closely with law enforcement agencies, going back decades to the development CompStat systems used to gather information and analyze crime trends. In recent years, it has developed technology for what it has marketed as “predictive policing.”
A viewing for George Floyd is held in Houston.
Houston mourned for George Floyd at a public viewing on Monday that stretched for more than six hours and became not so much a rally or a protest but an open-air memorial for a city’s fallen son.
Because of coronavirus precautions, only a few mourners at a time were allowed inside the Fountain of Praise church. Many wore masks, including some emblazoned with Mr. Floyd’s anguished cry, “I can’t breathe.” 
The majority were African-American, but there was a diversity in the crowd — one young white man held a bouquet of flowers as he stood in line. People held umbrellas, waved fans and sat in a cooling tent as the heat and humidity soaked faces and shirts.
“I’m going to wait in line all day if it’s necessary,” said Charles Edward Jackson, 70, a retired bus driver.
From noon to the end of the service shortly after 6 p.m., nearly 6,400 people walked past Mr. Floyd’s coffin, said a spokeswoman for Fort Bend Memorial Planning Center, the funeral home handling the arrangements.
Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, who met later with the Floyd family privately inside the church, was among the first to pay his respects.
“This is the most horrific tragedy I’ve ever personally observed,” Governor Abbott, a Republican, said of Mr. Floyd’s death in police custody. “George Floyd is going to change the arc of the future of the United States. George Floyd has not died in vain.” 
Carol Wright, 48, wiped tears from her eyes as she left the church.
“I wasn’t expecting the casket to be open, so that kind of caught me,” said Ms. Wright, an information technology consultant from the Houston suburb of Katy. “I was thinking about him calling for his mother and thinking about so many black men I know that age.”
The white police chief in Portland, Ore., resigns and asks a black lieutenant to take her place. 
The white police chief in Portland, Ore., announced that she was resigning from her leadership position on Monday and that she had asked a black lieutenant to replace her. The move comes after days of protests and chaos in the largely white, liberal city of 650,000. 
“Over the last 10 days, I’ve watched our city, I’ve listened, and I hear you,” the outgoing chief, Jami Resch, said at a news conference. “I have asked our community time and time again, what do we need to do? And each time we hear them say, ‘Show us change.’”
Ms. Resch, a veteran of the department who had served as chief for less than six months, said she would remain on the police force in an undetermined capacity. 
“To say this is unexpected would be an understatement,” her successor, Charles Lovell, said at the news conference. Chief Lovell praised Ms. Resch as a “selfless, caring leader” who wanted to do what was right for the community. 
He also directly addressed the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, whose fatal encounter with the police was captured on video that has driven two weeks of anger and demands for change nationwide. 
“As I watched the agonizing minutes tick by, it wasn’t the tactics, it wasn’t the number of officers there,” he said. “It was really the lack of care and compassion.”
“It almost felt like, ‘You’re not important,’” he added. He promised to fight against that idea in his police force and his city. 
While tensions have eased in the last few days between protesters and police in many cities, Portland has continued to see confrontations, with officers repeatedly using tear gas to disperse demonstrators.

The event, initially planned for the site of the State Fair of Texas, was moved online[2] because of the new coronavirus, which has infected and hospitalized record-high numbers[3] of Texans this month.'This is a tragic and traumatic time, and I never want to be the person who tries to create silver linings out of nothing, but things are so dark that the only things I can do at this moment are celebrate the small victories,' Johnson said. One of those victories, Johnson said, is that the festival will be more accessible[4] to people who are differently abled and to those who may not feel safe or comfortable attending Pride in person.But this year's Pride has also taken on another layer as the marches for LGBTQ equality overlap[5] with the ongoing protests of police brutality against Black people[6]. Finally, Johnson said, he's hearing folks talk about intersectionality[7] and lifting up the voices of queer and trans people of color[8].'Everyone is talking about social unrest, racial justice and police brutality. 
I feel like I woke up in the Twilight Zone. Let's stay here and let's keep everyone talking about it,' he said. 'Everyone is talking about social unrest, racial justice and police brutality. I feel like I woke up in the Twilight Zone. Let's stay here and let's keep everyone talking about it.' —Dom Johnson Pride month in recent years has often been associated with celebrating LGBTQ identity and community with rainbows, partying, corporate solidarity[9] and parades. But its history is rooted in resistance, protest and demands for equal rights. And Black and Latina trans women were leading figures[10] in the early days of the LGBTQ rights movement, most notably Marsha P. Johnson[11] and Sylvia Rivera[12].This year, Pride marches are getting back to those roots as participants stand alongside Black and brown queer and trans people, who are still fighting for equality on two fronts[13].Lo Roberts[14], president and CEO of Pride Houston[15], mourned with the rest of the nation after learning that George Floyd[16] took his last breath while a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck. Two days later, Tony McDade[17], a Black trans man, was shot and killed by police in Tallahassee, Florida. 'We need to do something,' Roberts, who is Black, said in a flurry of calls and messages with her staff and board of directors. Pride, this year, would have to change.In place of the traditional parade, Pride Houston was set to hold a march and rally[18] Saturday in support of its Black LGBTQ community and the Black Lives Matter movement. But on Friday evening, it moved the demonstration to an online rally[19] as the number of people affected by the coronavirus swells.The event is titled 'It started with a riot!' — an acknowledgment of the Stonewall riots[20], regarded as the first push into the modern LGBTQ rights movement[21]. First: Avion Wilson, left, and Kyrs Yayo at the 2018 Dallas Southern Pride Juneteenth Festival. Last: Ashley Williams, left, and Tangela Lewis take a selfie at the festival. Ben Torres for The Texas Tribune In June 1969, police raided the Stonewall Inn[22], a popular LGBTQ bar in New York. Police sexually assaulted trans women and lesbians and beat patrons. The raid, in combination with a history of police brutality against the LGBTQ community — especially Black and brown people — set off six days of protesting on Christopher Street in New York City.'It started with those individuals having a riot, having a rally, having a march to demand equality. So that's where we're taking it back to,' Roberts said. 'A lot of times, I get asked, 'Why do we still do Pride?' And this is exactly why, because we are not all equal in 2020.'This year, Texas LGBTQ leaders are using pride to reconcile years of excluding people of color and trans people.Equality Texas, an LGBTQ rights nonprofit, urged people in a written statement[23] Monday to march for Black and brown trans people and admitted that it made concessions when pushing legislation, like the James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Act[24], that excluded trans people from protection as victims of hate crimes. In the past five years, Texas had the most murders of trans people in the nation, The Dallas Morning News reported[25]. Danny Rogers, left, and Rayshawn Samuels attended the Dallas Southern Pride Juneteenth Festival in Dallas in 2018. Photo credit: Ben Torres for The Texas Tribune For years, many Texas LGBTQ organizations have been mostly led by white people and lacked meaningful outreach, programming and resources for people of color, advocates said. Organizations including Dallas Southern Pride[26] and Austin Black Pride[27] formed to create a space for the Black LGBTQ community.'There was not a lot of inclusion when it came to including some of the Black establishments and some of the Black people in some of the different Pride activities,' said Naomi Green, a representative for Dallas Southern Pride, which hosts events for the city's Black LGBTQ community.'It wasn't always as inclusive with Black people, and so we started our own so that we could celebrate being Black and being proud.'Pride can get to a point where it's inclusive and representative of the community's racial diversity, 'but we're not there. That's why you have Dallas Southern Pride,' Green said. Some organizations are taking the initial steps to more intentionally center Black LGBTQ Texans in, and outside of, upcoming Pride commemorations.This Saturday, Pride San Antonio will host a live virtual celebration on Facebook and YouTube. The event will still have hallmark traditions, including performances by local drag artists and a wedding ceremony, but it will also have a talk about this month's Supreme Court ruling on LTBGQ Americans' employment rights[28] and a panel with a local Black Lives Matter activist, said James Poindexter, secretary of Pride San Antonio.'Our emcees are going to chat with her about the connection between race and ethnicity and Pride and the importance of people being educated and being involved and being engaged,' Poindexter said.Advocates said it'll take active financial investment in the community, diversified programming, and representation of Black, brown, Indigenous and other people of color in leadership for concrete change. The influx of support is 'nice, but it's just part of the battle,' Green said. 'Just having attention is nothing without the work that comes behind it.'

Krugman tweeted[1], 'Overall, Americans took 9/11 pretty calmly. Notably, there wasn't a mass outbreak of anti-Muslim sentiment and violence, which could all too easily have happened. 
And while GW Bush was a terrible president, to his credit he tried to calm prejudice, not feed it.' As of Friday afternoon, the tweet has just over 500 retweets and 3,000 likes.

stations, projects like that. We also heard that a new UK infrastructure bank has been announced and it will be headquartered here in the north of England, which will finance infrastructure projects from next spring. A word of warning, though, from political leaders here in the north, including the Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham. He had said that big projects, years down the line don't help people now, whose lives have been put on hold. 
He said we don't want the north of England returning to another 1980s style of a prolonged, economic downturn. That was Fiona Trott in Newcastle. The headlines on BBC News... The cost of coronavirus - The Chancellor paints the true scale of the economic crisis facing the country - with the economy due to contract by 11.4% - the biggest fall in output in over 300 years. A pay freeze in England for just under half of public sector workers - Labour describes it a 'sledgehammer blow' for consumer confidence. Unemployment is forecast to hit 7.5% next year - leaving 2.6 million people out of work. Police in the West Midlands say they are investigating an alleged attack by secondary school pupils in Telford as a hate crime. West Mercia Police says it's aware of a video circulating on social media, which appears to show a pupil from the Sikh community being pushed by two other boys, before being struck a number of times in the head while on the ground. The force has described it as a deeply distressing incident, which it is treating with the utmost seriousnes. The Duchess of Sussex has revealed she suffered a miscarriage in July. Writing in the New York Times, Meghan Markle said it had happened while she was caring for her son, Archie - adding that the loss of a child was an almost unbearable grief, experienced by many but talked about by few. Our Royal Correspondent Nicholas Witchell reports. They are both thought to have been keen to have another child, after their son Archie's birth in May of last year. Earlier this year at their home in California, Meghan was pregnant. But then, as she has described in an article in the New York Times, one morning in July she felt a sudden cramp. She describes the tears she and Harry both shed and goes on, It is worth pointing out that the miscarriage itself happened in July at a time where, you know, they were not out of The headlines. You know, royal biographies being written about them. They could not escape the spotlight. And now we know, actually, the pain, as Meghan says, the unbearable grief that, as a couple, they were going through. Meghan is not the first member of the Royal Family to have a miscarriage. But she is the first to write about it. And she places it in the context of a year when so many have faced loss. It has been a year, she says, which has brought so many of us to our breaking points, whether through bereavement or the sharp divisions within societies. And she recommends a simple step, inspired, she says, by the interview she did in Southern Africa a year ago, when she was asked whether she was OK. Thank you for asking, because not many people have asked if I'm OK. But it's a very real thing to be going through behind-the-scenes. That question, ""are you OK"", is one from which she says we can all learn. As much as we may disagree, and as physically distanced as we may be at the moment, the Duchess suggests that we are in fact more connected than ever because of what we have collectively endured in recent months. It is a powerful appeal, hiding the couple's personal sadness. Nicholas Witchell, BBC News. The Chancellor has announced that council care services in England, which provide support for older and disabled people, will have access to an extra #1 billion in funding - but only a third of that is likely to be new money and those providing services say it is not enough. Our social affairs correspondent Alison Holt is with me. Allison, just clarify this for us. It sounds like a lot of money, but already that call, as we hear, not enough. Well, you have to remember when we went into the pandemic, the social care sector, support for people in their own homes and in care homes, was already described as being in crisis and in need of a lot more funding. Then you got the pandemic, with the increased demand and increased costs. So today, the Chancellor has talked about care services having access to an extra billion pounds in spending, and it does sound a lot of money. It's when you get down to the nitty-gritty,"

By Ari Gordon and Talib Shareef
(RNS) Some in our communities consider our friendship peculiar. What could an Orthodox Jewish academic from New York and an African American imam raised in North Carolina have in common?
But over the years we have built trust on a foundation of mutual respect and joint action. We visit, learn about, and teach in one another's faith communities. We stand in solidarity when the other's people are attacked. Above all, we nurture a bond of brotherhood through our shared human experience.
We have been pained to see a growing rift between African Americans and American Jews, as loud even if not representative voices hurl conspiratorial accusations and hateful rhetoric.
Those in our communities and without who prefer to sow seeds of division for political gain often trade on the lack of personal connections between the two communities and perceptions that are too often built upon ignorance of the other. For Jews and Muslims, meanwhile, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict presents a further challenge on the path toward Black-Jewish unity.
To counter these sources of division, we support initiatives such as #BlackJewishUnityWeek, a new collaboration of the American Jewish Committee and the National Urban League that begins Monday (Sept. 7). This partnership extends a proud history of shared struggle for civil rights to help America fulfill its promise of equal opportunities and justice for all.
But rapprochement between African Americans and Jews also carries the potential to bridge divides between Jews and African American Muslims, who make up 20% of all Muslims in the U.S. We can draw on shared religious values, a common empathy for the downtrodden, and a dire need for allies in the parallel fights against antisemitism and racism.
Our respective religious heritage, a pillar of identity for both groups, mandates that we embrace diversity, oppose inequity, elevate justice and encourage partnership.
The Quran teaches that from a single soul Almighty God created diverse expressions of human life ""male and female, nations and tribes"" to stimulate our curiosity to know one another and that differences in our ""tongues and colors"" point to God's greatness. The Talmud echoes the sentiment when it explains that humanity was created from a single person, Adam, to affirm the unity of the Creator, the equality of all, so that we might marvel in the sacred splendor of our diversity.
The holy texts of both traditions are replete with calls to justice, as when the Quran proclaims that ""God's word is fulfilled in truth and justice"" and when the prophet Zachariah demands ""justice with truth, and mercy towards one another.""
In America, great leaders of our communities manifested these values in action. Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel taught that ""no religion is an island"" and demonstrated just what he meant by marching alongside the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in Selma. Imam W. Deen Mohammed, the American Muslim leader who passed away in 2008, regularly preached the unity of the human family, an ideal that underpinned his rejection of racial supremacy and his decades of active interfaith cooperation with Jews and Christians.
Both of our communities know suffering, whether it be exile, genocide, slavery or discrimination. Neither of our communities' experiences as Americans or people of faith can be fully articulated without reference to oppression.
The two of us feel this heritage personally: One of us descends from enslaved Africans, torn from their homes and robbed of their humanity, mistreated, oppressed and degraded; the other from survivors of the Holocaust, their culture decimated and families exterminated by Nazi hatred and barbarism. We reject competitive victimization. Rather, our legacies of oppression call us to empathy with those in pain and to action.
Year after year the FBI reports that anti-Black violence dominates race-based hate crimes in our country. Jews remain the major target of crimes based upon victims' religion, while Muslims experienced the greatest increase in hate crimes in three of the last four years.
To push back against the rise in hate crimes, we joined the Muslim-Jewish Advisory Council (MJAC), co-convened by AJC and the Islamic Society of North America. MJAC's work to fight prejudice and bridge social divides is a tangible expression of our religious values and the lessons of oppression in action.
As American Jews and African American Muslims, we can dispense with the toxicity of mutual suspicion and reciprocal disparagement to write a new chapter of cooperation.
It is our hope that our partnership might bless this country as Imam Mohammad did in 1992, when he offered the first invocation by a Muslim before the U.S. Senate, that America ""live as a prosperous nation of 'many in one' and as a people of faith taking pride in human decency, industry and service,"" and that ""her big heart for charity, compassion, repentance, and mercy continue to beat strongly within all of us.""
Talib Shareef is president and imam of the Nation's Mosque, Masjid Muhammad. Ari Gordon is director of U.S. Muslim-Jewish Relations for the American Jewish Committee. Both serve on the Muslim-Jewish Advisory Council."

2020 has seen at least 37 transgender and gender non-conforming people violently killed, more than any other year since HRC began tracking this data in 2013. HRC has now tracked more than 200 deaths since 2013
Today, the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) Foundation, the educational arm of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) civil rights organization, released “An Epidemic Of Violence: Fatal Violence Against Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming People in the United States in 2020,” a distressing report honoring the at least 37 transgender and gender non-conforming people killed in 2020 and shining a light on data that HRC has collected since 2013 on the epidemic of violence.
With 37 known deaths this year, HRC has officially recorded more violent deaths of transgender and gender non-conforming people than any year since we began tracking this violence in 2013. Previously, the highest known number of fatal deaths of transgender and gender non-conforming people was in 2017, when we reported 31 people violently killed. Since January 2013, HRC has documented more than 200 transgender and gender non-conforming people who were victims of fatal violence. The release of this report comes one day ahead of Transgender Day of Remembrance, a time to remember the transgender and gender non-conforming people who have been lost to fatal violence over the course of the previous year.
“This year, we reached two grim milestones -- the Human Rights Campaign has recorded the most deaths of transgender and gender non-conforming people of any year since we began tracking this violence, and we have documented more than 200 total deaths. Every life that we have lost this year and every year had value and did not deserve to be cut short. Divisive and dehumanizing rhetoric from anti-equality political leaders has contributed to the toxic mix of racism, sexism and transphobia that drives this horrific violence. It’s on all of us to fight for change at every level and take action to support trans and gender non-conforming people. We must work to dismantle the stigma that so many in the trans and gender non-conforming community face, and bring this violence to an end. ”
Alphonso David, Human Rights Campaign President
“These victims, like all of us, were loving partners, parents, family members, friends and community members. They worked, went to school and attended houses of worship. They were real people -- people who did not deserve to have their lives taken from them. As we work to ensure that they are remembered with dignity in death, we will also continue to uplift the resilience and humanity of the entire transgender and non-binary community. ”
Tori Cooper, Human Rights Campaign Director of Community Engagement for the Transgender Justice Initiative
Many factors can lead to this violence, including anti-transgender stigma that can lead to the denial of opportunities in society, such as employment discrimination and exclusion from health care, as well as to increased risk factors such as poverty and homelessness. The combination of these factors, which are often exacerbated by racism and sexism, can lead to an increased risk of fatal violence. Learn more in HRC’s “Dismantling a Culture of Bias. ”
Although there are a few existing legal protections for transgender and gender non-conforming people -- such as the Violence Against Women Act, the Matthew Shepard & James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, the decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia and some state and local laws -- this violence cannot be stopped until the rights of transgender and gender non-confroming people are fully realized and our systems are reformed to address the epidemic and its root causes. The report lays out federal and state actions that would move us closer to ending violence against trans and gender non-conforming people.
The report also lays out what people can do to help combat this violence. This includes working to eliminate stigma against trans and gender non-conforming people, using the correct names and pronouns, supporting laws and policies that prohibit discrimination based on gender identity, uplifting transgender and gender non-conforming voices and building inclusive communities throughout society. HRC’s Transgender Justice Initiative was launched in 2019 to dismantle unjust systemic barriers to transgender empowerment and help end the epidemic of violence by addressing the root causes of the physical danger, hatred and discrimination faced by transgender people in the U.S
Last month, HRC President Alphonso David and Minneapolis City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins launched a “Pledge to End Violence Against Black and Brown Transgender Women” as part of HRC’s Transgender Justice Initiative. The Pledge asks state and local elected leaders to acknowledge the disproportionate and record-breaking fatal violence against transgender people in America, especially Black and Brown transgender women, and take decisive steps to deliver change that saves lives and advances the cause of LGBTQ equality. Earlier this month, HRC also released the “Blueprint for Positive Change 2020,” an important brief that includes 85 individual policy recommendations, reaching across the federal government, aimed at bettering the daily lives of LGBTQ people at home and abroad. The Biden-Harris administration has the opportunity to not only put our democracy back on track but deliver real positive change for LGBTQ people’s daily lives, and the Blueprint has been shared with the Biden transition team as they evaluate the policy steps of the incoming administration.
This year’s annual report found that since the start of the year, at least 37 transgender and gender non-conforming people have been killed in the U.S Of those 37 victims, 22 were Black and 7 were Latinx; 25 were Black or Latinx women. Since January 2013, HRC has documented more than 200 transgender and gender non-conforming people who were victims of fatal violence. Two-thirds of these known victims have been Black women and nearly 60% of known fatalities have involved a firearm. This fatal violence affects trans and gender non-conforming people nationwide, with HRC and advocates tracking cases of fatal violence since 2013 across 113 cities and towns in 33 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. These disturbing numbers likely underreport deadly violence targeting transgender and gender non-confirming people, who may not be properly identified as transgender or gender non-conforming by police, media or other sources.
The 37 known transgender and gender non-conforming people killed so far this year are: Dustin Parker; Neulisa Luciano Ruiz; Yampi Méndez Arocho; Scott/Scottlynn DeVore; Monika Diamond; Lexi; Johanna Metzger; Serena Angelique Velázquez Ramos; Layla Pelaez Sánchez; Penélope Díaz Ramírez; Nina Pop; Helle Jae O’Regan; Tony McDade; Dominique “Rem’mie” Fells; Riah Milton; Jayne Thompson; Selena Reyes-Hernandez; Brian “Egypt” Powers; Brayla Stone; Merci Mack; Shaki Peters; Bree Black; Summer Taylor; Marilyn Cazares; Dior H Ova; Queasha D Hardy; Aja Raquell Rhone-Spears; Lea Rayshon Daye; Kee Sam; Aerrion Burnett; Mia Green; Michelle Michellyn Ramos Vargas; Felycya Harris; Brooklyn Deshuna; Sara Blackwood; Angel Unique; and Yunieski Carey Herrera. In addition, the report also profiles three other cases of Black transgender women, Ashley Moore, Tatiana Hall and Draya McCarty. Not much information is available in these cases, but HRC will continue to monitor for additional developments. This year’s report also contains updates on the deaths of Nikki Kuhnhausen, Yahira Nesby, Mia Penny and Layleen Cubilette-Polanco, which occurred after the publication of the 2019 report, as well as Jennifer Laude.
The report comes just days after the Federal Bureau of Investigation released 2019’s hate crimes data, which shows an uptick in gender identity based hate crimes rising from 4.2% in 2018 to 4.8% in 2019. Because reporting hate crimes to the FBI is not mandatory, these alarming statistics likely represent only a fraction of such violence. That is why since the passage of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act in 2009, HRC has worked with the FBI to update the agency’s crime reporting. HRC continues to press for improved reporting, passage of state laws that protect LGBTQ individuals from hate crimes and expanded education and training initiatives.
This past week, HRC has commemorated Transgender Awareness Week, an annual event that is dedicated to illuminating both the progress and unfinished work in the fight for transgender and non-binary equality. The week culminates in Transgender Day of Remembrance, held every year on Nov. 20. To mark the week this year, HRC participated in a conversation with Angelica Ross at the TransTech Summit, hosted an Instagram Live with Luchina Fisher, Gia Parr and Ellen Kahn and an Instagram Live with Sarah McBride, held two film screenings of “Mama Gloria” and “Born to Be,” both of which included panel discussions after the screenings and joined an HBO summit around the new documentary “Transhood. ” We also released the next videos in our stop the stigma campaign with WarnerMedia, “See Each Other. Save Trans Lives.,” which feature uplifting vignettes that tell stories of joy. The videos are available at the following links: Nakiya Lynch, Alexis Abarca and Tori Cooper. Additionally, the HRC Foundation released a call to action to support trans and gender diverse youth with new CDC data, and HRC’s Trans and Gender-Expansive Staff Employee Resource Group released a new resource on the history of the trans and non-binary community. Finally, HRC will be hosting a panel tomorrow at 11 a.m EST to mark Trans Day of Remembrance. See a full list of HRC’s actions and resources from the last week here."

The killing of George Floyd was shocking. But to be surprised by it is a privilege African Americans do not have.
A black person is killed by a police officer in America at the rate of more than one every other day. Floyd's death followed those of Breonna Taylor, an emergency medical technician shot at least eight times inside her Louisville, Ky., home by plain-clothes police executing a no-knock warrant, and Ahmaud Arbery, killed in a confrontation with three white men as he jogged through their neighborhood in Brunswick, Ga. Even Floyd's anguished gasps were familiar, the same words Eric Garner uttered on a Staten Island street corner in 2014: ""I can't breathe.""
Yet the timing and cruelty of Floyd's death, captured in a horrific video that shows the white Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin casually kneeling on the victim's neck, has spurred a national uprising. Since Floyd died on May 25, demonstrations have erupted in scores of cities across the country as veteran activists and newfound allies alike rally to the cause of racial justice. The vast majority of the protests have been peaceful, with simple demands handwritten on torn pieces of cardboard. Enough is enough. Stop killing us. Justice for George Floyd. Those pleas have resonated around the world, producing expressions of solidarity from Europe to New Zealand.
The protests have also triggered civic unrest in America at a scale not seen since the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. Protesters burned a police precinct in Minneapolis, torched cop cars in Los Angeles and Atlanta, and dodged plumes of tear gas from Tulsa, Okla., to Madison, Wis. By June 2, the National Guard had been activated in at least 28 states, and dozens of cities had imposed curfews to quell looting, arson and spasms of violence. Militarized police surged cruisers into crowds, fired rubber bullets at reporters and beat citizens peacefully exercising First Amendment rights.
For 2½ months, America has been paralyzed by a plague, its streets eerily empty. Now pent-up energy and anxiety and rage have spilled out. COVID-19 laid bare the nation's broader racial inequities. About 13% of the U.S. population are African Americans. But according to CDC data, 22% of those with COVID-19, and 23% of those who have died from it, are black. Some 44% of African Americans say they have lost a job or have suffered household wage loss, and 73% say they lack an emergency fund to cover expenses, according to the Pew Research Center. ""It's either COVID is killing us, cops are killing us or the economy is killing us,"" says Priscilla Borkor, a 31-year-old social worker who joined demonstrations in Brooklyn on May 29.
If the video was the match and the coronavirus was the kindling, Donald Trump provided the kerosene. Since the start of his term, the President has turned the Oval Office into an instrument of racial, ethnic and cultural division. A man who both-sided a white-supremacist march, went to war with NFL players protesting police brutality, called African nations ""sh-thole countries"" and told American Congresswomen of color to ""go back"" to where they came from was never going to appeal for harmony now. As the Floyd protests spread, Trump called demonstrators ""thugs,"" threatened them with ""vicious dogs"" and borrowed a phrase popularized by the Miami police chief Walter Headley in 1967: ""When the looting starts, the shooting starts.""
Given the tone from the top and the grassroots anger, it's a surprise this confrontation didn't come sooner. The movement for racial justice was arguably the biggest story in America before Trump came along. Black Lives Matter began as a protest cry and bloomed into a political force: activists won convictions and shaped federal policy, seeding their message across college campuses and popular culture, in legislation and presidential platforms.
It wasn't enough, but it was progress, and to many activists, Trump looks like white America's response. ""Trump was elected in part because Black Lives Matter was winning,"" says Jessica Byrd of the Movement for Black Lives. ""Trump was our punishment."" If so, he was an effective one. The President pokes sore spots in the body politic so incessantly that no single cause can sustain the nation's attention. Protest is a performance, and the audience Black Lives Matter found during the tail end of the Obama Administration has been subsumed into the broader anti-Trump ""resistance,"" which pinballs between outrages: the Muslim ban, children in cages, impeachment. In a way, Black Lives Matter has been a victim of its own accomplishments: it articulated a language of subjugation that could be applied to causes such as immigration or gender or class. Systemic injustice became about everything, rather than the original thing, which was police killing black people.
That hasn't stopped. From 2015 to 2019, according to statistics compiled by the Washington Post, police shot and killed 962 to 1,004 Americans each year. Black Americans are nearly three times as likely as white people to be killed by police, according to the database Mapping Police Violence. The killings are continuing apace this year. Except now it seems to many as if the nation has moved on. ""For us to get the attention that we need, we've gotta set things on fire,"" says James Talton, a 32-year-old New York fitness instructor. ""Because it seems like nobody's paying attention.""
Nationwide riots, a virus that has killed more than 100,000 Americans, a President threatening to unleash the military on citizens--how much more can the country bear? Every day in this awful, exhausting year feels like rock bottom, and then we tunnel further into some hideous crawl space. More than 40 million jobs have vanished in 10 weeks. One in four Americans is out of work. And the reckoning continues.
It feels both terrible and fitting that the struggle poised to define the final months before a bitterly divisive election is a conflict that dates to America's founding, a force so powerful it can push even a once-in-a-century pandemic aside. Those who have fought for racial justice for years--for decades--are resolute. ""I believe that we have been working these past four years to get back in the ring with Trump,"" says Byrd. ""And I truly believe that we will win.""
George Floyd died at dusk on Memorial Day, outside the Cup Foods grocery store at East 38th Street and Chicago Avenue in South Minneapolis. Floyd had bought a pack of cigarettes with what the clerk suspected was a counterfeit $20 bill. Three squad cars converged to confront him as he sat in the driver's seat of a blue Mercedes SUV.
Derek Chauvin's was the last to arrive. Since joining the Minneapolis police force in 2001, Chauvin has been the subject of at least 17 conduct complaints, almost all of which were closed without discipline, according to city records. He was involved in at least three cases in which a police officer shot a civilian. Another of the officers involved in Floyd's arrest, Tou Thao, was the subject of at least six complaints, five of which resulted in no discipline (one is still under investigation). In 2017, Thao was sued in federal court for excessive use of force over allegations he beat up a suspect during an arrest. The city settled for $25,000, according to a legal filing. (Attorneys for Chauvin and Thao did not respond to requests for comment.)
Chauvin and Thao are just the start. A review of federal and city records reveal a broader picture of impunity within the Minneapolis police department. A 2015 report by the U.S. Justice Department found that only 21% of conduct complaints against Minneapolis police were ever investigated. Only 13 out of nearly 1,200 complaints processed from October 2012 to September 2015 resulted in discipline, according to local news reports. In most of those cases, the police officer in question was sent for ""coaching.""
What disciplinary structures do exist are weak. The department's office of police conduct review can only make a recommendation to the chief, whose own decisions can be reversed. ""I have seen so many instances where the chief imposed discipline and an officer was fired, only to have it overturned or reduced,"" says Teresa Nelson, legal director of the ACLU in Minnesota.
For two decades, federal officials repeatedly recommended reforms to increase accountability, curb use-of-force violations and build up community trust, according to more than half a dozen government reports. But Minneapolis lagged behind most other metro police departments in implementing them. Experts say the department stands out for the permissive language of its guidance, which notes that the unconscious neck restraint can be used if the subject is ""exhibiting active aggression"" or ""active resistance.""
The results have been evident on the streets. Since 2015, Minneapolis police have rendered people unconscious with neck restraints like the one Chauvin applied to Floyd at least 44 times, according to an NBC News analysis; in three-fifths of those cases, the subject was black. Black residents were about nine times more likely than whites to be arrested for low-level offenses, according to a recent ACLU study. ""People in this community have been very concerned about the Minneapolis police department for a long, long time,"" says Hans Lee, a pastor at Calvary Lutheran Church. ""It was a tinderbox.""
Police brutality has also made Minneapolis a locus of racial-justice activism. After the 2014 killings of Garner on Staten Island and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., protesters occupied the Mall of America and shut down freeways. In November 2015, after Jamar Clark, an unarmed black man, was shot and killed in North Minneapolis, protesters established an encampment outside a nearby precinct for 18 days. The following year, after Philando Castile was shot in a Minneapolis suburb by police during a confrontation livestreamed in part by his girlfriend, activists thronged the governor's mansion for weeks.
Like the rest of America, Minneapolis activists have faced new challenges under Trump. The 45th President has exacerbated the tensions between police and communities across the country, unwinding some of the key criminal-justice reform measures that President Obama had championed. Trump's first Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, reinstated a program that allowed the Pentagon to send state and local police forces surplus military equipment like armored vehicles, grenade launchers, bayonets and battering rams. Sessions restricted the Obama Administration's use of consent decrees, which are court-ordered agreements to overhaul local police departments accused of abuses and civil rights violations. He also scaled back a voluntary program Obama created to help reform police departments.
Shortly after 5 P.M. on June 1, a line of nine military trucks carrying National Guard troops in helmets and tan camouflage uniforms slowly rolled onto the White House grounds and down a narrow alley near the West Wing. The trucks' canvas tops passed just below the windows of the offices of the President's chief of staff, Vice President and National Security Adviser, and turned along a fence line typically filled with tourists snapping selfies before the building's iconic North Portico.
The rare display of military might outside the seat of American power was only the beginning. ""I am your President of law and order,"" Trump declared in the Rose Garden, just before curfew descended on Washington on the seventh night of national unrest. Trump threatened to deploy ""thousands and thousands"" of ""heavily armed"" military personnel to quash the protests. As he spoke, officers fired rubber bullets and sprayed chemicals to disperse demonstrators outside the White House gates. Shortly after, twin-engine UH-60 Black Hawk and UH-72 Lakota helicopters swept just above the tree line over the capital's streets, buzzing a crowd of protesters with a downwash of air, debris and fuel exhaust in an apparent ""show of force,"" a maneuver used to cow insurgents in combat zones.
Trump's aides believe the confrontations will play to the President's political advantage in the run-up to the November elections. The unrest ""really makes you want tough, Republican leadership,"" a White House official says. ""People do not want their streets to be lit on fire."" Campaign advisers see in the chaos a reprise of 1968, when Richard Nixon successfully courted white voters with coded racism against African Americans after years of sporadic urban rioting.
Not all Republicans are convinced. ""Trump's re-election chances are going down in flames,"" says Dan Eberhart, a Republican donor and Trump supporter. ""It's hard to see how these riots don't boost Joe Biden's claim to be the Alka-Seltzer America needs to soothe its stomach right now."" Stuart Stevens, a Trump critic who served as chief strategist to 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, notes that Trump won in 2016 with 46% of the vote because nonwhite turnout declined for the first time in 20 years. ""You can call them protests, but you could also call them nonwhite voter-turnout rallies,"" Stevens says of the racial-justice demonstrations. ""It's hard to imagine anything that's going to be more motivating.""
Even before Floyd's death, race relations in America were regressing. Trump has emboldened a burgeoning white-supremacist movement. Hate-crime violence reached a 16-year high in 2018. Roughly two-thirds of Americans told Pew Research Center last year that expressions of racism have grown more common during his term. ""There is literally a brewing civil war that is happening,"" says Alicia Garza, one of the founders of Black Lives Matter.
But moments of grace have emerged from the miasma of pain and despair. In Camden, N.J., police locked arms with activists and marched along with them. In Flint, Mich., the Genesee County sheriff removed his riot gear, laid down his weapons and embraced protesters. From Fayetteville, Ark., to Omaha, police took a knee in solidarity.
Two hours before Trump left the White House for a photo op at a burned church, before the sting of noxious chemicals wafted across Lafayette Square and a line of officers on horseback charged peaceful protesters, Anya Colon stood in sight of the White House columns, holding a Black Lives Matter poster. Her grandmother had marched in Selma, Ala., in 1965 to push local authorities to allow black people to vote. Now Colon, 38, had driven seven hours from Rome, N.Y., spurred by a sense of duty. ""Trump catalyzed a lot of racism,"" she says. ""We have to do some things that make change. This marching has been going on for decades. I had to be here. Something from inside my gut drove me and pulled me here."" She had come with her cousin Iliana Arthur, 41. Arthur also held a sign. It read: We matter.

""Trump catalyzed a lot of racism,"" she says. ""We have to do some things that make change. This marching has been going on for decades. I had to be here. Something from inside my gut drove me and pulled me here."" She had come with her cousin Iliana Arthur, 41. Arthur also held a sign. It read: We matter.

Key Facts
One in threeAmericans would decline to take a coronavirus vaccine even if it were free and approved by the FDA: This August Gallup poll is particularly worrying because experts say widespread vaccination is likely the only way to stop the pandemic.
Two thirds of young Americans surveyeddidn t knowthat 6 million Jews were murdered during the Holocaust: This survey, commissioned by the Claims Conference, which negotiates restitution for Jewish victims of the Nazis and their heirs, comes afteranti-Semitic hate crimesreached a peak last year, according to a May report.
A jaw-dropping 44% of Republican respondents to a Yahoo News/YouGov poll said they believed that billionaire Bill Gates is seeking to use a coronavirus vaccine toimplant microchipsand track people s movements: The bizarre, baseless conspiracy theory stems from the fact Gates has pouredhundreds of millions of dollarsof his wealth into coronavirus vaccine research and development.
One in four young Americanscontemplated suicideduring the month of June: As the pandemic and ensuing fallout has seen anxiety and depression increase, young people ages 18 to 24 appear to be among the hardest-hit, with a staggering 25.5% of 5,412 survey respondents reporting they had considered killing themselves, according to a Centers for Disease Control report.
One in three teachers say they re more likely toleave teachingor retire early because of the pandemic: According to a nationwide survey of 816 public school educators, America s teachers are mulling over a change of career more often since coronavirus hit, a trend that could have devastating consequences as parts of the country were already facinga teacher shortage.
Key Background
The fast-approaching presidential election may be contributing to deep partisan divides involving aspects of life that are not inherently political. Along with the debunked Gates coronavirus vaccine microchip conspiracy theory, Republicans wereless likelyto wear face masks early on in the pandemic as Trumpdeclinedto use them before being photographed wearing one in public forthe first timein July.

by Feminist Newswire
A new public service announcement (PSA), released by the Advertising Council (Ad Council) and created by Emmy-award winning writer Alan Yang, aims to combat the increase in harassment against Asian-Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the last three months, the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, along with Chinese for Affirmative Action, have collected reports of over 2,100 incidents of harassment against Asian-Americans, including the use of racial slurs and threats, as well as instances of assault. The PSA was released as part of the Ad Council's ""Love Has No Labels"" series, which has received awards and millions of views since its launch 5 years ago. It features a number of Asian-Americans discussing the racism they have experienced during COVID-19 and has been released along with an augmented reality (AR) filter to help viewers show their solidarity with the PSA's message. Resources for combating racism have been uploaded to the Love Has No Labels website.
The PSA was created to counter what has been criticized as inaction by the federal government in response to the surge in harassment against Asian-Americans. After both the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001, and the outbreak of SARS in 2003, the federal government quickly worked to combat discrimination against a number of communities who were wrongfully blamed for the events.
No such action has been taken in response to the anti-Asian harassment brought about by COVID-19. While the FBI has released a memorandum to local law enforcement agencies, warning them that ""hate crime incidents against Asian Americans likely will surge across the United States"" due to COVID-19, they do not seem to have taken further steps to stop this harassment.
Many blame President Trump for the increase in anti-Asian rhetoric and harassment. President Trump has continuously referred to COVID-19 as the ""China virus"" and has called the virus ""kung flu."" Although President Trump has since told reporters that the virus is not the fault of Asian-Americans in ""any way, shape, or form,"" as recently as yesterday he has continued to utilize the term ""China virus"" in his tweets.
Meanwhile, Asian-Americans face increasing levels of harassment. A Pew Research Survey found that 58% of Asian-Americans surveyed believed that the expression of racist and insensitive views about Asian people had increased since the pandemic began. A further 30% of respondents stated that they had experienced increased instances of racist jokes or slurs and 26% of respondents said that they feared being threatened or physically attacked because of their race.
Ad Council President and CEO Lisa Sherman stated that ""At a time when hateful rhetoric and racially-fueled discrimination are plaguing the API community, it's critical that we all play a role in dispelling the racist misconceptions and actions pervading our country....We hope this film will inspire Americans to rethink their biases and help put an end to the wave of racism facing the API community.""

On Monday, Trump went after Wallace, NASCAR's only Black driver, calling for him to apologize to fellow NASCAR drivers and officials for his part in what the president described, in all-caps as ""just another HOAX.""
In June, a member of Wallace's team reported a noose hanging in Wallace's garage at Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama. NASCAR officials condemned the noose, but a subsequent investigation by the FBI found that the knot wasn't targeted at Wallace specifically, but had been in the garage since 2019. Apparently used as a pull-down for the garage door, the origins of the noose or the intention behind its tying remain unknown. It was not, as the President of the United States alleged, a hoax.
While most NASCAR drivers let the president's words against their colleague and competitor go unchallenged, driver Tyler Reddick stood up for Wallace on Twitter, writing, ""We don't need an apology. We did what was right and we will do just fine without your support.""
But after the sentiment was shared in several news stories regarding the president's tweet and reactions to it, Reddick deleted the tweet. Newsweek has reached out to Reddick for an explanation behind its deletion, but did not hear back by time of publication.
Reddick subsequently reiterated his support for Wallace in a less confrontational manner, by retweeting thoughts from Fox Sports NASCAR reporter Bob Pockrass.
""There is nothing to apologize for,"" Pockrass wrote, describing the chain of events surrounding the noose-knot garage pull as reasonable responses to ""a perceived threat,"" including ""making policy to be more inclusive.""
In the same tweet in which President Trump falsely described the noose incident as a hoax, he also alleged that the combination of the FBI's hate crime investigation and the ""Flag decision"" resulted in the ""lowest ratings EVER!""
Trump is here alluding to NASCAR's June decision to ban the Confederate symbol, which NASCAR described as running ""contrary to our commitment to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all fans."" But the president is wrong about the reaction to the ban, which didn't result in the lowest ratings ever. Instead, viewership of NASCAR races went up from the previous year after the announcement, while Sunday's Brickyard 400—part of NASCAR's Cup Series—topped the ratings, garnering more than four million viewers.
Combining false accusations and incorrect information, the president's tweet was described by The New York Times as a ""race-based appeal to white voters"" and part of a pattern of ""racist language and references"" intended to inflame his conservative base. Other outlets have documented the president's propensity for attacking the intelligence of Black people in particular.
Newsweek has also reached out to NASCAR for further reaction to the president's tweet.

New York City, one of the most demographically diverse places on the planet, is also home to one of the most segregated school districts in America. That contrast has rattled New York’s self-image and given rise to major integration efforts over the past several years. Most have failed. And across America, desegregation has never been tried at scale, partly because of resistance from white liberals.
Inspired by the release of a new podcast from Serial and The New York Times, “Nice White Parents,” we brought together a panel of five experts to discuss the obstacles to integration in New York and elsewhere, and the ways some people are beginning to reconsider its value and focus on empowering Black and Latino parents who have so often been left out of the debate about their own children’s educations.
We asked: Why is integration a talking point, but not yet a political priority, in such a proudly liberal city? What does research tell us about why integration works, and what does history reveal about why it so rarely succeeds? And will this moment of profound societal upheaval actually change anything about how our schools work?
The Participants
Dana Goldstein is a national education correspondent for The New York Times.
Tiffani Torres is a rising college freshman at Georgetown University and a recent graduate of Pace High School in Manhattan.
Richard Buery is the president of Achievement First, a network of charter schools in the Northeast.
Chana Joffe-Walt is a reporter and producer at This American Life, and the host of “Nice White Parents,” a new podcast from Serial and The New York Times.
Sonya Douglass Horsford is a professor at Columbia University’s Teachers College.
“Desegregation has failed because America has not really tried.”
DANA GOLDSTEIN There’s a robust and growing body of research that pretty conclusively demonstrates the benefits of integration. We have known since the 1960s that Black and Latino students who attend integrated schools with a significant white population have more access to the arts, to newer textbooks, to better extracurricular opportunities.
We also know that when it comes to academic achievement, high school graduation rates, lower participation in the criminal justice system, and also adult earnings, those low-income students and students of color who attended integrated schools generally have better outcomes on every single one of those measures, while white and middle-class students who attend integrated schools generally do not experience adverse effects.
Indeed, there’s really interesting sociological research on the benefit to white and middle-class students of attending schools that are more racially and economically diverse. It appears to have a real long-term impact on their social beliefs, their tolerance toward diversity, their willingness to live in more diverse neighborhoods and their excitement about sending their own children to integrated schools.
SONYA DOUGLASS HORSFORD I would say most people really do support and want integrated schools. But we haven’t been able to maintain integrated schools because you really have to want integration to succeed and be willing to give something up to achieve success.
So while there has been extensive research documenting the points that Dana made about some of the benefits in terms of achievement outcomes as a result of proximity to whiteness, I just don’t know that form of integration or that evidence speaks to the ways in which desegregated spaces can create hostile environments for children of color. We’re seeing increased evidence of such hostility in the current moment.
RICHARD BUERY Something I’ve heard my wife say, which resonates for me, is that the tools we use to attack segregation are so much smaller than the tools we used to build it. So it’s not so much that desegregation has ever failed, it’s that we’ve never really tried.
If you look over the 100-year history of our country, during the long period, even after Brown vs. Board of Education, nothing really happened other than in Little Rock itself and a few other towns.
So you could just compare this 20 years or so in American history of limited desegregation efforts, and you compare that to 400 years of Black people in America. Desegregation has failed because America has not really tried. And the reason why no one in America has really tried is because, I think, the majority of Americans are not actually interested in integration.
They fear sending their children to school with Black and Latino children, or because they fear sharing resources with those students, and/or because they view education essentially as a zero-sum game and worry that, If I do something that expands opportunity for some other kid, my child may suffer in their access to privilege or access to opportunities or access to resources. And most humans are not willing to risk their own children for their values and ideals.
ELIZA SHAPIRO Dana, can you describe some of the things you learned when reporting about resistance to integration in places like Montgomery County, Md., and San Francisco?
GOLDSTEIN A busing plan in suburban Baltimore, a plan to allow more Black and Latino students to access gifted and talented education in Montgomery County, Md., and a choice system for schools in San Francisco were supposed to magically lead to integration. But, in fact, they led to neighborhoods that were more integrated than the schools in them. As you know, white and Asian families used the choice system to avoid the school down the block and instead cluster in a small group of coveted schools.
My conclusion was similar to one of the points Chana makes in the podcast, which is that accidental integration is not a type of integration that’s very likely to work for Black and brown and low-income children. Because white and privileged parents who go into diverse spaces without believing that it is important to be part of an equal, diverse community of parents and students end up trying to mold these schools to the benefit of their own kids above all others. And it just happens again and again.

SHAPIRO Rich, can you speak briefly about what it was like to be one of the very few Black students at Stuyvesant High School, a specialized school in New York City, back in the early 1980s?
BUERY I went to middle school in Bushwick, which is an exam school which served entirely Black and Latino students at the time. Going to Stuyvesant was a culture shock for me. Remember, this was the 1980s, so Stuyvesant, although it was not diverse by any stretch, was significantly more diverse than it is now. There were many more Black and Latino students than there are now.
It was a deeply disorienting experience from a lens of race, from a lens of class. I still to this day struggle with some of the anxiety that I developed, the impostor syndrome, the stereotype threat, which I think were all sparked at Stuyvesant. And the microaggressions from people today, who I consider my friends, who asked me, do I think I got into Harvard because of affirmative action? I still carry these things with me.
There was no effort at Stuyvesant to think about what it would be like for a Black kid from East New York to come to that school, and to make sure that it was a truly integrated environment that supported members of all races. The fact of the matter is that in this city, it’s always integration on white people’s terms.
I know that so much of who I am and where I’ve gotten in life comes from the privilege of attending Stuyvesant, the way it prepared me academically, the way it educated me about the world, the way it launched me into elite private college education. At the same time, it would be hard to describe an experience as a reaffirming experience.
For me it represents a foundational failure of our city. Specialized high schools are just emblematic of the extreme version of a systemic problem. Why did our city continue to rely so deeply on admissions requirements like grades and tests for competitive schools when we know the discriminatory impact they have? It can only be because we don’t think that Black students and Latino students are as smart as other students, that they deserve as much as other students.
GOLDSTEIN I was part of a desegregation program and was bused in a town in the Hudson Valley called Ossining, N.Y. And all through my teenage years, and into college, I considered it to be one of the most positive and powerful aspects of my life. I really strongly identified as a white person who benefited from attending an integrated school, through exposure to people whose backgrounds were not similar to mine, through having a more diverse group of friends.
When I became an education reporter, however, I reflected a lot on how poorly integration had worked for so many of my classmates of color. We were a town that had a very large Black and Latino population, and yet the advanced placement college track that I was on was overwhelmingly white. I had maybe two Black teachers my entire education. I don’t think I had any Latino teachers.
So I think anyone who immerses themselves for years in these questions is going to come out with a much more nuanced perspective on it. But I do ultimately still find the empirical evidence in support of integration really compelling.
DOUGLASS HORSFORD It wasn’t until I began studying desegregation when I really became interested in my own educational experience and being bused in the sixth grade. And so here in Clark County, where Las Vegas is located, we havethe fifth largest schooldistrict in the country, but a very small African-American population. In 1968, the NAACP challenged the Clark County School District for maintaining intentionally segregated schools, in Kelly v. Mason. And the court found in favor of the NAACP.
But then it required this very small population of Black students to be bused to other parts of the county, into west Las Vegas. And it required that other students, white students predominantly — I was included in that because I lived outside of west Las Vegas — to be bused into the historic African-American community for one year.
But I never really viewed my experience as negative. I had a diverse group of friends, based on where I stayed. I had exposure and experiences with individuals whose background was different than mine. We also shared a lot of things in common. And I feel that, in this moment, rather than focus on the things that we do share in common, we are so obsessed and focused on the things that differentiate us.
SHAPIRO Tiffani, you had excellent grades in middle school. You then applied to Eleanor Roosevelt High School, a selective school on the Upper East Side that has a geographic preference for admission. But you didn’t meet that preference, since you live far from Manhattan, in Brownsville, a mostly low-income neighborhood in Brooklyn. How did you feel about getting rejected from what was at one time your dream school?
TIFFANI TORRES I believed the process had been advertised to me as open choice, where if I worked hard throughout middle school and got good grades — and I did — then there was no reason why I shouldn’t be able to attend any of the schools in the city. That’s what I thought.
And then I didn’t get a seat at any specialized high school. I did not understand a lot of the material that was on the test at all. My parents kind of saw it as, OK, she gets good grades so she’s prepared for anything that the school system has to throw at her. But I realized that that wasn’t the case.
I am a first-generation student. I’m Dominican Latina. My parents came here in the ’70s, in a very different time. And so they have very different views than I do on integration and what it means to be a first-generation student in the school system and what it means to go to schools that are majority Black and Hispanic.
What they saw was that white people didn’t live in our communities. But white people were successful. And they were more fearful of my future than I was because they saw that. Because I wasn’t in spaces where white people lived or where they went to school, they worried I wouldn’t be successful.
But I’m very glad that I didn’t go to Eleanor Roosevelt. I remember a few years ago a student was handed a tampon with the N-word written across it. She was, I think, one of the only Black students in her grade. And the school itself is majority white students. I have never gone to a school that wasn’t majority Black and Latinx students, or where there wasn’t a majority of students who qualify for free or reduced-price lunch like me.
“Integration is no longer the most important issue for Black families.”
SHAPIRO It is notable, as Tiffani has pointed out, that Mayor Bill de Blasio has mostly avoided using the word segregation to describe the state of New York City schools, which we know are, in fact, segregated. He has instead used the word diversity.
Chana, can you tell us how you’ve come to understand the difference between integration and diversity, equality and equity?
CHANA JOFFE-WALT One thing that I really came away with from even just the first year I spent reporting in the school, where the school saw this huge influx of advantaged white families in a single year, was just how limited our language is or how intentionally imprecise our language is in talking about integration. Within that school year, diversity was used to describe what was happening to the school: That this large group of white families was coming in, and it was becoming a diverse community.
But that word seemed a stand-in meaning different things to different people. So you would hear white families talking about wanting to be part of a diverse school. For them, diverse seemed to describe the fact that the school had Black and Latinx kids in it. Families of color would describe all of the diversity coming in, referring to the white kids. Some were excited this would mean more resources coming to the school. Others saw it as a threat that their school would be taken over.
I think there was also a lack of clarity when the school was being planned in the early 1960s in the middle of the school integration movement in New York City. The schools were de facto segregated. But the Board of Ed would not say the word segregation because, I think, segregation implied intent and also responsibility. So if the schools were segregated, then it was the fault of the institution that runs the schools and the responsibility of that institution to fix it. So the Board of Ed would talk about racial imbalance or racial separation.
Integration advocates, and Black and Puerto Rican parents and organizers then talked about integration as a tool to access all of the things that white kids in the city already had access to — to experienced teachers, to reasonable class sizes and functioning toilets. And the Board of Ed, instead, talked about this idea of coming together in racial harmony and that integration was not a remedy for injustice. They were using the word the way that we use the word diversity today.
So I think that you can see that even back in the 1960s, Black parents really talked about integration as a means to an end. But the Board of Ed and white parents talked about integration as a virtue in and of itself.
SHAPIRO That brings me to a foundational question: Who is integration actually for? Do we have diverse schools to make white people feel less guilty? Or do we have integration to dismantle structures of systemic racism that have excluded Black and Latino kids from having access to all that public education can offer them?
DOUGLASS HORSFORD I think the integration conversation is more of a conversation that’s happening among those who enjoy some level of privilege — nice white parents. Where is the groundswell of pro-integration efforts and support led by Black and other disenfranchised communities? I just don’t see it coming from the families that integration is supposed to benefit.
Integration is no longer the most important issue for Black families. Today, Black parents are worried about whether or not their children will be safe — whether because of Covid or violence on campuses or hate crimes or police brutality. In this moment, talking about integration feels like such a distraction.
JOFFE-WALT When I began the podcast, I took the need for school integration as a given. I thought of it both from my own perspective, with some sentimental ideas about the benefits of diversity, and wanting that for my own children. I also thought integration seems like an obvious goal because of the empirical evidence we’ve discussed. But also, segregation is anathema to the American promise. Separating people by races is caste. So it seemed like integration was an obvious good.
I think that what has changed for me is that I walked through the history of a school where integration has been invoked over and over again as a virtue, and used as a reason to pursue policies and programs that benefit white parents, that benefit advantaged parents — and that didn’t actually shift power within the school. After that, I started to have some doubts.
There were so many ways in which the school system and white parents maintained segregation in the school by creating separate academic tracks, by clustering in certain schools, or by hoarding resources. And I was especially struck by how this was true when white families were inside of the school I profiled during that first episode.
So I think it is more important to talk about race and power in more explicit terms, and to talk about this history. I think people like me need to reckon with what our legacy is with public schools and to really question what we mean when we say that we are striving to achieve integration, or diversity, or whatever word we use.
“It would be enormously controversial in New York City.”
SHAPIRO Rich, you oversaw an initiative when you were at City Hall to try to get more Black male teachers into city schools. I know at KIPP and at Achievement First, you have really put an emphasis on having a staff that looks like the kids that they serve. Why is it important for Black students to have Black teachers?
BUERY When I was at City Hall, about 40 percent of our students were Black or Latino males and about 8 percent of our teachers were Black and Latino males. I had only two Black male teachers during my entire public education career, both in middle school.
Over the last few years, we’ve seen really compelling research around the positive impact that having even one teacher of color can have on the educational trajectory of Black students. And also how few young people actually have exposure to Black teachers, particularly male teachers of color.
But there are all sorts of barriers, including regulatory barriers such as teacher licensing exams in many states that disproportionately exclude people of color, even though there is little or no evidence that your score on those exams impacts the quality of instruction.
SHAPIRO I wanted to dig into this question about what we talk about when we talk about resources. In a lot of ways we’re talking about fund-raising and the power that comes with fund-raising prowess. We know that schools across New York City, for example, have radically different P.T.A. annual fund-raising totals every year.
Dana has written about this idea of pooling P.T.A. donations across schools and districts and had a wonderful story a few years ago about the controversy such pooling set off in Southern California. Some parents said they did not want their donations going to other children’s schools. Can you talk about what you found there and whether you think the idea might have a shot in other places?
GOLDSTEIN The depressing thing is that in Santa Monica and Malibu, which is the district that attempted the P.T.A. pooling, it sort of added fuel to the fire of this simmering movement for the Malibu part of the district, which is the whiter, wealthier part, to secede, essentially. And we’ve seen these secession movements across the country.
So I don’t know how hopeful I am that it can be done without an enormous amount of controversy in other places as well. But I was impressed with some of the concrete and pragmatic things I saw that the pool donation system was able to accomplish.
It purchased things like a beautiful arts program, a drama program, a telescope for astronomy for the students. It was something they were able to do because the overall district was diverse even though there was still some segregation within the school buildings themselves and across the building. We’re largely talking about a program that was intended to benefit low-income Latino families and the schools their children attended.
I think it would be enormously controversial in New York City. When I looked at the data on the richest P.T.A.s in the country, a lot of them are in places like the Upper West Side, the Upper East Side, the Village, brownstone Brooklyn. So telling those parents that some certain percentage of what you give will not be for your kid’s school is going to be enormously controversial here.
SHAPIRO I’d be remiss not to ask about the rise of these home-schooling pods. We are hearing a lot of anecdotes about white families with means who believe their children should not have to suffer through another year of remote learning. And they are getting together and, in some cases, taking their kids out of the public school system, possibly hiring teachers away from the public school system.
And it strikes me that these pods, even if they are a small trend, tell us a fair amount about how accidental segregation happens by well-meaning people who just don’t want their kids to lose out.
DOUGLASS HORSFORD As a parent, I think parents are going to do what they think is in the best interest of their kids. I don’t believe that investing in strategies that will try to change their behavior around that is going to work.
I mean, just to be honest, in the culture that we live in, it’s about individualism. It’s about getting the upper hand. You have people writing letters for kindergarten students in New York City to get into a kindergarten program. So I think we just have to be realistic about that, the culture that we live in, and what history has shown us.
But I think the question for me is how should parents who may not have the means, but have the wherewithal, can create their own educational networks and communities to help them during the pandemic — and beyond. So that’s what I’ve been giving thought to — and to how educators and community organizations could be working directly with parents and families to meet those needs.
The focus needs to be shifting, for those who are focused on justice, from equity to emancipation. That means for students of color, for immigrant students, for others who have been marginalized in the U.S. school system, to recognize the system that they’re in and to begin to think about ways to liberate themselves from that.
“I’m hopeful because I know that I can change something.”
SHAPIRO We are in the midst of this huge reckoning over race and justice. And we don’t really know how this movement is going to trickle down to schools. To wrap up, I would love everyone to talk about whether you feel any optimism that this sort of reckoning could change anything about how whether school districts work for equity.
JOFFE-WALT I was reading something the other day about how every article about reopening schools reaches a point where it talks about the need for federal funds and for investment. And that we are all really failed by the lack of planning and investment and coordination across all of our public systems. We’re all harmed by the lack of investment in public institutions. I am not very hopeful that it is going to go in the direction of more equitable schools.
We are all harmed by the lack of investment in public institutions but we are not all harmed in the same way. We don’t all have the same options available to us when it comes to filling in gaps where our public systems fail. If we have no collective response to this crisis, and if we don’t demand leadership and robust public institutions then yes, inequities will get worse.
GOLDSTEIN When I was watching the George Floyd protests, I was noticing that many of the white neighborhoods where a lot of white liberals were out participating in Black Lives Matter demonstrations were some of the same neighborhoods that resisted school integration. And that filled me with a lot of despair. I am not sure when those people on the street are going to grapple with resistance to policies like integrating schools and building affordable housing.
I then had to cover the news that tens of millions of the nation’s children are going to be learning online in the fall. And that led many of my peers and so many socioeconomically privileged parents of all races to talk about fleeing the public system into so-called learning pods. Or to embrace the idea that if you pay a private school tuition, you might be more likely to get in-person education this year. So when I consider all of these things, I don’t feel particularly hopeful.
I do, however, think that some of the families that are participating in segregating practices, like the whole private podding thing, are at least talking about and acknowledging the impact of their decisions. That’s a step forward from where we may have been a year ago, before the pandemic and before George Floyd.
BUERY I guess I’m of two minds here. Other than the pandemic itself, the crises that we face today are not really new. Racial oppression is obviously not new, including in schools, which were in so many ways designed to be the instruments of oppression. And public health has been a crisis for Black people for generations.
So on the one hand, I’m not hopeful. Historically, just because there was a big dislocation doesn’t usually resolve to the benefit of people without power. It’s not like we got more wealth equality after the ’08 financial crisis.
But on the other hand, I also realize that all the great changes in our society probably seemed impossible on the other side of the change. I think hope is a discipline. Because hope is a fuel that keeps you working. So I think I am hopeful. But I think you wake up every morning and you force yourself to be hopeful.
And I will say one last thing that gives me fuel. Not to put her on the spot, but it’s people like Tiffani. When I go out and see marches, it’s really the energy of young people who have been at the forefront of every movement for social change in this country and who are in the forefront of this movement.
TORRES Thank you, Richard. I feel like I’m just getting started. And there have been a lot of disappointments, I think, especially this year.
I’m going one day to be in a position where I can change something. And I think that I’m not necessarily hopeful in the sense that I think everything will change overnight. Because obviously, that won’t happen. I know that there are going to be a lot of people who oppose the movement for racial and educational equity.
But I’m hopeful in the sense that I think that there will be progress. I’m hopeful because I know that I can change something. And I’ve seen that already happening, not just with myself, but also with other students whose experiences are currently being elevated.
DOUGLASS HORSFORD Well, I’m very hopeful, actually. And I think it’s because I’ve been beating this drum for a minute. And I feel like the consciousness is changing around these issues.
I’m also very encouraged by the work of young people like Tiffani and even my children, and by just seeing how this moment has ignited their activism and their boldness. They’re just not going to put up with things in ways that even I did.
I think that we just need to make sure that we’re really supporting young people and giving them the tools and the space and the resources to engage in that activism. And that we continue to really focus on resources and representation. But we’ve got to also go back to the political space, the political dimension of all of this, and make sure that we are engaging in political participation, voting, electing people who share our commitment to equity and justice, and support them in doing their work. And with that we will get through this.

The secretary's salary is funded by American taxpayers. 
But lately, press briefings held by White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany ""have begun to look purely political,"" White House Correspondents' Association President Jonathan Karl told CNN's Brian Stelter on ""Reliable Sources"" Sunday. 
Karl's comments follow an op-ed he published Saturday in the Washington Post titled: ""It's the duty of the White House press secretary to hold briefings. But not like this."" He said Sunday he is advocating for changes to the briefings before his tenure heading the Correspondents' Association ends this week. 
The press secretary ""has a job to inform the public by informing the reporters that the public uses to get information,"" said Karl, who has covered briefings under four presidents and 14 different press secretaries.
""The press secretary serves at the pleasure of the President, but this is a different job,"" he said. ""She is not the spokesperson for a campaign, she is not the spokesperson for a political party. She is the spokesperson for the executive branch of the federal government of the United States. It is a different job, it is not a purely political job, and those briefings have begun to look purely political.""
CNN has contacted the White House press secretary's office for comment. 
In his Saturday op-ed, Karl referenced a White House press briefing last week during which reporters asked McEnany about a tweet from President Donald Trump that appeared to link NASCAR's decision to remove Confederate flag imagery from all races and events with lower ratings.
Trump tweeted: ""Has @BubbaWallace apologized to all of those great NASCAR drivers & officials who came to his aid, stood by his side, & were willing to sacrifice everything for him, only to find out that the whole thing was just another HOAX? That & Flag decision has caused lowest ratings EVER!""
During the briefing, Karl and other reporters asked McEnany to clarify Trump's position on the Confederate flag and explain whether Trump thought NASCAR's decision to ban the flag was a mistake. 
In response, McEnany said reporters were taking the President's tweet out of context and stressed that the tweet was really about the FBI's findings in its investigation of a noose found in the team garage of NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace, which concluded that Wallace was not the victim of a hate crime. 
""You're focusing on one word at the very bottom of a tweet that's completely taken out of context,"" McEnany said during the briefing. 
To Karl, the interaction was an example of the press secretary ""denying the president's own words and failing to answer legitimate questions about something he had done hours earlier,"" he wrote in his opinion piece. 
On Sunday, Karl said he believes the regular briefings are needed but called for them to change. ""This has to be an aberration, it cannot stay this way,"" he said. 
""I believe that the person who is the spokesperson for the executive branch of our government has a responsibility to go before the press and answer questions on a regular basis,"" Karl said. ""But I also believe those must be informative, that those can't be purely political.""
Karl also expressed concern that the briefings have begun to be used to ""undermine the press, not inform the press."" 
""There was a briefing ... where she looked out at the reporters in the room, I was in the room, and she said, 'the people in this room desperately want to keep churches and houses of worship closed,'"" Karl said, referencing a briefing in late May. ""As if reporters somehow want to see churches closed ... I hope she will change course. I'm glad there are briefings but I think those briefings should not be purely political stunts.""

""Jerusalem and the Jewish people are inextricably linked,"" said AJC CEO David Harris. ""For millennia, Jews have been central to Jerusalem and Jerusalem has been central to the Jews. And yet, there are some who deny or minimize our connection to Judaism's most sacred city, ignoring age-old religious and historical texts, irrefutable archaeological evidence, and the Jewish people's deep and impassioned attachment to Jerusalem since antiquity. This important video tells the story of Jerusalem through Jewish eyes, introducing audiences across the Arab world to the facts behind the Jewish people's powerful connection to the city. Only once that connection is acknowledged, alongside that of Christians and Muslims who also venerate the city, will true peace between Israel and her Arab neighbors be possible.""
The new animated short film is the fourth in AJC's Arabic-language video series, 'An al-Yahud (""About the Jews""), which has reached tens of millions across the Arab world. Launched earlier this year, the project's Arabic-language Facebook page has over 168,000 followers and its Twitter account has over 63,000. The top locations of the videos' viewers include Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Tunisia, the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Jordan, and the United Arab Emirates. The previous three videos focused on the origins and beliefs of the Jewish people, the history of Muslim-Jewish relations, and the Holocaust.
'An al-Yahud builds on AJC's extensive and longstanding engagement with the Arab and Muslim worlds. For more than three decades, AJC leaders have regularly met with Arab and Muslim leaders across the Middle East and North Africa to exchange views on matters of mutual concern, among them the fight against extremism, Muslim-Jewish relations, and deepening ties between Israel and Arab states. In the United States, AJC co-convenes the Muslim-Jewish Advisory Council (MJAC) with the Islamic Society of North America, offering Muslim and Jewish leaders a platform for advocacy on combating hate crimes, religious discrimination, and other domestic issues of common concern."

In celebration of the relationship between America's Black and Jewish communities, and in opposition to antisemitism and racism, the National Urban League and American Jewish Committee are partnering to designate the week of September 7th Black-Jewish Unity Week. The hashtag #BlackJewishUnity will be used to promote the unity week's themes and programs to strengthen Black-Jewish understanding and joint advocacy.
""American Jews have been among the staunchest allies of Black Americans since the Great Migrations,"" National Urban League President and CEO Marc H. Morial said, noting that one of the founders and first chairman of the board of the National Urban League was the prominent Jewish American economist Edwin R.A. Seligman. ""Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman, who fought for civil rights and died alongside James Chaney, are among the most revered martyrs of our movement.""
David Harris, AJC's CEO, said ""Black and Jewish Americans share a special responsibility and burden to stand together against hate, racism, antisemitism, ignorance, and intolerance.""
A key objective of Black-Jewish Unity Week is urging Congress to pass the National Opposition to Hate, Assaults, and Threats to Equality (NO HATE) Act, which would improve hate crime reporting through law enforcement trainings, the creation of reporting hotlines, increasing resources to liaise with affected communities, and public educational forums on hate crimes.
""Hate crimes are on the rise all over the country,"" Morial said. ""Yet a shocking number of cities are failing to report these crimes to the FBI, hindering the nation's ability to address this increase.""
Harris said, ""Jews have for too long been the primary target for religiously-motivated hate crimes, while African Americans are by far the most targeted for racially-motivated crimes. When we stand together against bigotry and hate, we stand stronger.""
Leaders of the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Caucus on Black-Jewish Relations will introduce a resolution officially designating the week in honor of mutual understanding and recognition of the joint need to combat antisemitism and racism.
The organizations will jointly observe the week with a series of events aimed at fostering a deeper cultural and historical understanding and appreciation between the two communities. Daniel Elbaum, AJC's Chief Advocacy Officer, will appear on National Urban League's ""For the Movement"" podcast, and Clint Odom, National Urban League's Senior Vice President for Policy and Advocacy, will be a guest on AJC's podcast, ""People of the Pod.""
Morial and Harris will appear together on a joint NUL and AJC Advocacy Anywhere Zoom Event at 12 PM (EST) on September 8.

In Minneapolis, where four former police officers were charged over their involvement in the death of Floyd, four City Council members on Monday outlined a plan that saw community-based programs as a replacement for police department. The city council on Sunday voted to dismantle the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD), which has long been accused of racism. 
According to the newly-proposed plan, the community-based programs will focus on reducing violence and limit the need for an armed law enforcement response. The reform could take a year before a new apparatus for public safety takes form, a council member said. ""Decades of police reform efforts have proved that the Minneapolis Police Department cannot be reformed, and will never be accountable for its actions,"" members of the council said in a statement. Floyd died on May 25 at the hands of four officers of the MPD, with one of them keeping his knee down on Floyd's neck for almost nine minutes. All of the four officers have been fired, facing criminal charges. In Albany, New York State lawmakers on Tuesday voted to repeal a decades-old provision that had kept police officers' disciplinary records secret, making the records and misconduct complaints transparent. The measure is among a package of bills at the state legislature targeted at addressing police brutality. On Monday, the lawmakers already passed bills to ban chokeholds in law enforcement -- as was applied in Floyd's case -- and make false race-based 911 reports a hate crime. On a national scale, Democratic leaders of the U.S. House and Senate on Monday introduced legislation aiming to reform policing policies in the country. The legislation, led by the Congressional Black Caucus, was announced at a news conference attended by Chair of Congressional Black Caucus Karen Bass, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, among other senior Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill. ""We cannot settle for anything less than transformative structural change,"" Pelosi said when introducing the bill. ""Police brutality is heartbreaking reflection of an entrenched system of racial injustice in America. True justice can only be achieved with full comprehensive action."" According to the text of the Justice in Policing Act of 2020 cited by U.S. media, the bill will make it easier to prosecute police misconduct and recover damages caused by law enforcement. It will create a National Police Misconduct Registry, mandating state and local law enforcement to turn over data on the use of force related to such factors as race, gender, disability, religion and age, while preventing ""problem officers from changing jurisdictions to avoid accountability."" The proposed law will ban certain policing tactics, require that federal police officers wear body and dashboard cameras, and set restrictions on the transfer of military-grade weaponry to state and local law enforcement. As part of the legislation effort, House Judiciary Committee will hold an oversight hearing Wednesday on policing practices and law enforcement accountability.

Congressman Paul D. Tonko joined with more than 200 of his Congressional colleagues this morning to introduce the Justice in Policing Act of 2020, legislation that would, among other things, ban police chokeholds, restrict ""qualified immunity"" that prevents police officers from being sued for misconduct, create a national registry to track officers with a history of misconduct, end no-knock warrant use for drug cases and make lynching a federal hate crime. The bill is being led by Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.), who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, and Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, as well as Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.).
""The murder of George Floyd has shocked the conscience of millions of Americans and once again exposed the virulent racism that has long festered at the heart of so many of our nation's institutions, including the manner in which we enforce the law,"" said Tonko. ""Our bill takes several urgent steps forward in addressing the most dangerous and deadly policing practices that have been widely and disproportionately used against Black Americans and other people of color. One piece of legislation cannot cure 400 years of racial violence, injustice and economic oppression. Much of our collective work remains unfinished. However, Congress and the President should move without delay to pass and sign into law the Justice in Policing Act of 2020. The American people are demanding immediate action. Let us heed their call at once.""
The Justice in Policing Act of 2020 includes:
* Major Unprecedented Reforms to Curb Police Brutality, End Racial Profiling, and Eliminate Qualified Immunity for Law Enforcement
* The first-ever comprehensive approach to hold police accountable for misconduct, change the culture of law enforcement and build trust between law enforcement and our communities.
* Makes it easier for the federal government to successfully prosecute police misconduct cases, ends racial and religious profiling and eliminates qualified immunity for law enforcement.
* Bans the use of chokeholds and no-knock warrants--which took the lives of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Eric Garner--at the federal level and encourages states to do the same.
* Measures to Transform the Culture of Policing to Address Systemic Racism and Help Save Lives
* Does not provide any new federal funds for police departments, except where constitutionally-mandated for data collection, and instead supports critical community-based programs to change the culture of law enforcement and empower our communities to reimagine public safety in an equitable and just way.
* Establishes public safety innovation grants for community-based organizations to create local commissions and task forces to help communities develop concrete alternative policing practices that create accountability.
* Encourages departments to meet a gold standard in training, hiring and de-escalation strategies to address systemic racism and bias on the front end. This will help save lives and ensure accountability.
* Increases to Police Accountability and Transparency*
* Establishes the first-ever national database of civilian police encounters, including use of force and traffic stops; requires the collection, analysis and release of such data.
* Requires the collection of data on police-misconduct to track and prevent dangerous officers from moving from one department to another to avoid accountability.
* Incentivizes the use of independent prosecutors for police misconduct investigations.
* Helps take weapons and equipment manufactured for the battlefield off of our streets.
* Requires the use of body and dashboard cameras.

The bill ""establishes a bold, transformative vision of policing in America"", said Congressional Black Caucus Chair Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., at a news conference where Democrats introduced the measure.
She added Americans should not have to witness ""the slow murder of an individual by a uniformed police officer"", noting that the bill has more than 200 co-sponsors in both chambers of Congress.
The Democratic plan did not meet many activists' demands to slash — or entirely cut — police funding.
Bass stated that the bill ""does not provide any new money for policing"". It does offer funds for two components: the requirement to track and report use of force and the investigations by state attorneys general.
It is unclear whether the bill as written — or any specific parts of it — could garner support from Republicans. The GOP controls the Senate, while Democrats hold the House.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer noted that ""in the Senate, Democrats are going to fight like hell"" to pass the legislation. He called on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to bring the bill to the Senate floor and hold a debate on it ""before July"".

The police believe the victims were chosen at random, but they are not treating the rampage as terrorism.
A search was underway in Birmingham, England, on Sunday for a man who was said to have carried out a series of stabbings across the city that left at least one person dead and seven more wounded, two of them seriously, the police said. 
 The police have shared images and video footage of the man thought to be responsible for what the police said appeared to be a ''random attack.'' 
 Chief Superintendent Steve Graham of the West Midlands Police said that officers were still searching for a motive, but that there was no indication the stabbings were related to terrorism, a hate crime or gang violence.
 The police have confirmed that at least one man was killed and that two people, a man and a woman, had serious injuries. Five others were also wounded, and their injuries were described as minor.
 No link has been established among the victims, leading the police to believe that the stabbings were done at random.
 They declared the situation a ''major incident,'' a designation that describes any episode involving serious harm or a security risk to the public. A murder investigation has been opened.
 The attacks happened in several spots across central Birmingham, a city about 120 miles northwest of London. The first was reported to the police shortly after midnight in the north of the city, and the others followed over the next few hours, ending in an area known for its busy nightlife. The police said they believed that the stabbings were linked and that one man was responsible for the crimes.
 ''We are doing everything we can to trace the offender,'' Superintendent Graham said at a news conference. 
 Video footage of the suspect taken from surveillance cameras was released by the West Midlands Police on Sunday evening as they appealed to the public to help in identifying the man. 
 The police have urged anyone who was in the city center late Saturday or early Sunday to share information, photographs or video related to the attacks.
 The video of the suspected attacker matches descriptions given by witnesses to some of the incidents. 
 A witness to one stabbing told Sky News that he had seen a man wearing a black hooded sweatshirt and a cap stabbing a woman in the neck several times. The man evaded attempts by other witnesses to chase him.
 ''It happened very quickly,'' the witness, Savvas Sfrantziz, a bar owner in the nightlife area, told Sky News. ''He just went up to her and just stabbed her. I've never seen anything like it.''
 David Nash, who runs another bar in the same area, said that as the bars were closing around 2 a.m., he saw someone in a hooded top walking down the street and heard someone shout, ''Stop him -- he's just stabbed somebody!''
 ''Then, of course, this person took off into the night,'' Mr. Nash told BBC News. The area was soon overrun by emergency vehicles, he added.
 The police have urged Birmingham residents to be alert, warning that the attacker was still at large, and they promised to increase the presence of uniformed and armed officers within the city center on Sunday.
 ''Our emergency services are working hard to find whoever is responsible and bring them to justice,'' Britain's home secretary, Priti Patel, said on Twitter.
 The country's foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said it was ''a very serious incident'' and urged anyone in the area to ''be vigilant.''
 David Jamieson, the West Midlands police and crime commissioner, said, ''We're well used on a Friday and Saturday night to activity, but I think what is different is the randomness of this particular event.''
 Serious violent crime, including stabbings, has risen sharply in Britain in recent years. While gun crime is a rare occurrence compared with the United States, Britain has faced a large increase in knife crime.
 Six people, including a police officer, were injured in Glasgow, Scotland, in late June amid a stabbing attack in a hotel. Days earlier, three people were killed and three others injured in a stabbing at a park in Reading, England, in what the authorities described as a terrorist incident.

Pockets, the North Buffalo bar that closed earlier his month after its patrons shouted racist slurs at demonstrators rallying for police reform, has quietly reopened. The Erie County Health Department cleared the Hertel Avenue bar to reopen Monday, after it submitted a plan to ensure the safety of patrons during the COVID-19 pandemic. Plywood that had covered its door and front windows has been removed and a limited number of patrons are being admitted. 
Meanwhile, the State Liquor Authority told Investigative Post it opened an investigation into the bar earlier this month. Apparent violations of COVID-19 health and safety regulations triggered the probe. Other issues could come under review, an SLA spokesman said. 'What we saw was a disturbing incident,' said spokesman Bill Crowley. 'But what we're looking into is the health and safety violations.' A reporter from Investigative Post stopped by the bar Tuesday night and found the front door locked. A woman who answered the door said the bar is being careful about who is admitted due to death threats. Investigative Post returned to the bar Wednesday afternoon. The door was unlocked and about 10 patrons were eating and drinking. Owner Philip Alagna was not present, but he called Investigative Post a short time later for a brief conversation. 'I've been in a lot of bullshit for the last thirty days,' he said. 'Something that was done to us that should have never happened. And I want to leave it alone and I don't want to be no goose for anybody, okay?' He then told the reporter: 'Don't come around. Don't film. Nothing. I had enough problems for thirty days. I made no money - no money. Because of idiots. Friggin' idiots.' Who are the idiots? 'You know who,' he said. Update, 8:27 p.m.: The above quotes are taken from a telephone interview from a person who identified himself as Phil Alagna when he called Investigative Post. After the story published, someone who identified himself as Phil Alagna called the reporter to claim he never spoke with anyone from Investigative Post and that he was upset with the quotes attributed to him. Alagna, a retired sewer authority employee and a prolific Democratic donor, is married to New York State Supreme Court Justice Diane Devlin. The bar has been used to stage numerous fundraisers for Democratic Party candidates.

Comments can be addressed to Attention: Renewals, State Liquor Authority, 80 South Swan Street, Suite 900, Albany, NY 12210. The timing is coincidental with the Sept. 1 incident. The bar first filed for its liquor license in 1994, according to the authority's online public database[5]. The bar has been shuttered since Sept. 2, the day after patrons and employees were recorded on video hurling racist insults and taunt[6]s, including use of the 'n-word,' during a protest march that paused in front of the bar. Alagna's brother, Alessio Alagna, who works for the Buffalo Sewer Authority, mooned the crowd. He was subsequently suspended by the Sewer Authority. Bar owners later apologized for the incident in a statement that read in part: 'We do not condone racism or violence.' The Erie County Department of Health's Division of Environmental Services began an investigation after the videos surfaced. The department said the review was triggered by videos of maskless patrons on an overcrowded patio. Kara Kane, a spokesperson for the Health Department, said no further action was required. The owners requested a letter acknowledging their new safety plan. The department obliged, according to Kane, who said the measures the bar took were all voluntary. The Health Department letter said the bar 'may open' Sept. 28. 'Neither a review of the safety plan nor the letter was required,' Kane said. The Sept. 1 march was in response to a prior incident on Hertel Avenue near the bar.

Acting editorial page editor Kathleen Kingsbury wrote about the decision to publish our writers’ responses to the Tom Cotton Op-Ed in Friday’s edition of our Opinion Today newsletter. 
Last week’s decision by this newspaper to disavow an Op-Ed by Senator Tom Cotton is a gift to the enemies of a free press — free in the sense of one that doesn’t quiver and cave in the face of an outrage mob. It is a violation of the principles that are supposed to sustain the profession, particularly our obligation to give readers a picture of the world as it really is.
And, as the paper dismisses distinguished journalists along with controversial opinions, it’s an invitation to intellectual cowardice.
Start with the Op-Ed itself, in which Senator Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, called on the federal government to deploy active-duty troops to American cities in the wake of looting and rioting that accompanied overwhelmingly peaceful protests.
I don’t agree with Cotton’s view. I know of nobody at The Times who agrees with it. The Wall Street Journal’s editorial page doesn’t agree with it. Ditto for much of the mainstream media, at least its more liberal precincts.
Then again, isn’t this the biggest problem these outlets have faced in recent years — being of a single mind on subjects that sharply divide the nation? Isn’t that how we got into trouble in 2016, with our rock-solid belief that Donald Trump couldn’t possibly win?
In the week of the Op-Ed’s publication, an ABC News/Ipsos poll found that 52 percent of Americans favored deploying troops to help quell violent unrest in American cities. That’s not a political fringe unworthy of consideration. And Tom Cotton isn’t some nobody you’ll never hear from again. He has the pulse of his party, the ear of the president and an eye on higher office. Readers deserve an unvarnished look at who this man is and what he stands for.
Many critics of the piece’s publication think otherwise. The paper’s editors’ note said the senator’s Op-Ed didn’t meet The Times’s editorial standards. To which one might ask: Would the paper have stood by the article if Cotton had made a better case for sending in troops, with stronger legal arguments and a nicer tone? Or were the piece’s supposed flaws a pretext for achieving the politically desired result by a paper that lost its nerve in the face of a staff revolt?
A second criticism is that the paper could have examined Cotton’s views without giving him an unmediated platform; that his proposal should have been evaluated by the news department, not published uncritically in the Opinion pages; and that his arguments went beyond the moral pale.
But the value of Cotton’s Op-Ed doesn’t lie in its goodness or rightness. It lies in the fact that Cotton is a leading spokesman for a major current of public opinion. To suggest our readers should not have the chance to examine his opinions for themselves is to patronize them. To say they should look up his opinions elsewhere — say, his Twitter feed — is to betray our responsibility as a newspaper of record. And to claim that his argument is too repugnant for publication is to write off half of America — a remarkable about-face for a paper that, after 2016, fretted that it was out of touch with the country we live in.
The most serious criticism is that publication of the piece puts black lives at risk, including members of the Times staff.
That’s a vital consideration, especially now, and one about which no responsible publisher can be indifferent. No one can look away from the deaths of black Americans at the hands of the police, and the overall rise in reported hate crimes in recent years.
But as important as it is to try to keep people safe against genuine threats, it is not the duty of the paper to make people feel safe by refusing to publish a dismaying Op-Ed. Even if one concedes that Cotton’s call to send in the troops poses potential risks, it poses those risks whether his call appears in these pages or not. To know Cotton’s views is, if nothing else, to be better armed against them.
The same goes for any other type of knowledge, however unpleasant: Having more of it is always a source of strength — a belief that lies at the core of our profession.
Or, I should say, used to. There is a spirit of ferocious intellectual intolerance sweeping the country and much of the journalistic establishment with it. Contrary opinions aren’t just wrong but unworthy of discussion. The range of political views deemed morally unfit for publication seems to grow ever wider. Arthur Miller once said a good newspaper is “a nation talking to itself.” What kind of paper will The Times be if half the nation doesn’t get to be even an occasional part of that conversation?
All this is a tragedy. We have an obligation as journalists to be rigorous in fact and argument. We also have an obligation to keep undeniably hateful ideas, like Holocaust denial or racism, out of the editorial pages. But serious journalism, complete with a vigorous exchange of ideas, cannot survive in an atmosphere in which modest intellectual risk-taking or minor offenses against new ideological orthodoxies risk professional ruin.
It’s also an irony. Who, after all, has gained the most from the turmoil at The Times? That would be Tom Cotton, who first got the benefit of a public furor that helped make his piece the most read Op-Ed in The Times last week — and then got to pose as a tribune of free speech against the censorious leftists and stampeded editors at the “Fake News.”
If that’s a victory for Cotton’s ideological opponents, I wonder what defeat looks like.

Today’s Highlight in History:
On July 22, 1862, President Abraham Lincoln presented to his Cabinet a preliminary draft of the Emancipation Proclamation.
On this date:
In 1587, an English colony fated to vanish under mysterious circumstances was established on Roanoke Island off North Carolina.
In 1933, American aviator Wiley Post completed the first solo flight around the world as he returned to New York’s Floyd Bennett Field after traveling for 7 days, 18 and 3/4 hours.
In 1934, bank robber John Dillinger was shot to death by federal agents outside Chicago’s Biograph Theater, where he had just seen the Clark Gable movie “Manhattan Melodrama.”
In 1937, the U.S. Senate rejected President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s proposal to add more justices to the Supreme Court.
In 1942, the Nazis began transporting Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto to the Treblinka concentration camp. Gasoline rationing involving the use of coupons began along the Atlantic seaboard.
In 1946, the militant Zionist group Irgun blew up a wing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, killing 91 people.
In 1957, Walter “Fred” Morrison applied for a patent for a “flying toy” which became known as the Frisbee.
In 1967, American author, historian and poet Carl Sandburg died at his North Carolina home at age 89.
In 1975, the House of Representatives joined the Senate in voting to restore the American citizenship of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.
In 1991, police in Milwaukee arrested Jeffrey Dahmer, who later confessed to murdering 17 men and boys (Dahmer ended up being beaten to death by a fellow prison inmate).
In 1992, Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar escaped from his luxury prison near Medellin (meh-deh-YEEN’). (He was slain by security forces in December 1993.)
In 2011, Anders Breivik (AHN’-durs BRAY’-vihk), a self-described “militant nationalist,” massacred 69 people at a Norwegian island youth retreat after detonating a bomb in nearby Oslo that killed eight others in the nation’s worst violence since World War II.
Ten years ago: President Hugo Chavez severed Venezuela’s diplomatic relations with neighboring Colombia over claims he was harboring leftist guerrillas. The city manager, assistant manager and police chief of Bell, California, resigned after outraged residents found out through a Los Angeles Times investigation that the officials were making a total of more than $1.6 million a year. Six people were killed when a Greyhound bus crashed into an overturned SUV on a highway in Fresno, California. (Authorities later said the SUV driver, who died in the collision, was drunk.)
Five years ago: A Soyuz space capsule blasted off for the International Space Station, docking with the orbiting outpost nearly six hours later. Prosecutors in Colorado urged the death penalty for Aurora movie theater shooter James Holmes, saying he deliberately and cruelly killed 12 people (Holmes ended up being sentenced to life in prison when the jury could not unanimously agree on execution). A federal grand jury indictment charged Dylann Roof, the young man accused of killing nine Black church members in Charleston, South Carolina, with 33 counts including hate crimes that made him eligible for the death penalty. (Roof would become the first person sentenced to death for a federal hate crime; he is on death row at a federal prison in Indiana.)
One year ago: Teammates, family and friends gathered at a Catholic church in Santa Monica, California, to mourn Los Angeles Angels pitcher Tyler Skaggs, who had been found dead in his Texas hotel room on July 1. “Old Town Road,” by Lil Nas X, remained at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart for a 16th week, tying a record set by Mariah Carey and Luis Fonsi. Equifax agreed to pay at least $700 million to settle lawsuits over a 2017 data breach that exposed the Social Security numbers and other private information of nearly 150 million Americans.

""We in the Muslim World League are proud to should to shoulder with our Jewish brothers and sisters to build understanding, respect, love and interreligious harmony,"" said al-Issa from Mecca in a virtual conference organized by the Combat Anti-Semitism Movement and the American Sephardi Federation.
He said that Jews and Muslims need to work together to rebuild ties and create ""bridges of dialogue"" between their communities. ""Whereas Jews and Muslims lived centuries together, in these last decades we have sadly grown apart,"" al-Issa said. ""Now, we must rebuild the bridges of dialogue and the bonds of partnership between our communities... Since taking over the Muslim World League, it has been my mission to fight the forces of hatred and violence.""
Earlier this year, al-Issa visited the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp, where he said, he ""stood united alongside my Jewish brothers and said: Never again. Not for Jews, not for Muslims, not for Christians, not for Hindus, not for Sikhs. Not for any of God's Children. History's greatest horror, the Holocaust, must never be repeated.""
Additional speakers at the event included Elan Carr (US Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism), Sam Brownback (US Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom) and Ahmed Shaheed (UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Belief and Religion). During the event, al-Issa was honored with an inaugural award for his contribution towards fighting antisemitism.
Al-Issa condemned hate crimes across the world, including the spate of recent attacks against Jews. ""Your community has tragically been the target of several terrorist attacks. In Pittsburgh; in San Diego; in Munsey, New York; in Halle, Germany. I condemned each and every one of these horrible assaults upon humanity. As if they were attacks on Muslims,"" he said.
Sacha Roytman-Dratwa, director of the Combat Anti-Semitism Movement said that the way to defeat antisemitism is by working together. ""At a time when Iran's spiritual leader calls for the destruction of the Jewish state, the Sheikh's statements condemning the hatred of Jews are of particular importance, especially given the scrutiny he often faces,"" Roytman-Dratwa said.
Combat Anti-Semitism is a non-partisan grassroots movement of individuals and organizations, across religions and faiths that works to ending antisemitism in all its forms.

In business and academia, media, and sports, we see people holding opinions that deviate from the leftist discourse being attacked.

Even a UCLAprofessor may be placed under investigation[4]forreading Martin Luther King's ""Letter from a Birmingham Jail"" to his students, orhis colleague[5]could be suspended from his job after refusing a student's request to effectively cancel final exams for black students amid protests over the death of George Floyd.There's a data scientist who once worked for President Obama's re-election campaign whowasfired[6]from a research firmforretweeting[7]an academic studysuggesting that nonviolent protests may be more politically effective[8]than violent ones. We're seeing conservative media —Zero Hedge and the Federalist[9]— being pressed by Google to censor their content by barring them from Google's ad platform. We're seeingcorporations changing logos[10]of their productsdubbed racist[11]on Twitter.We're seeing leftist journalists who managed to preserve the most valuable professional skill — critical thinking — becoming victims of this insanity, too, when groups of fellow staffers demand the firing or reprimand of colleagues who made politically ""problematic"" editorial or social media decisions. TheNew York Times,theIntercept,Vox,thePhiladelphia Inquirer, Variety,and others saw racially based challenges to management, which was brilliantly depicted by Matt Taibbi in his refreshing piece ""The American Press Is Destroying Itself[12].""In the most discussed and infamous case of SenatorTom Cotton (R-Ark.)op-ed entitled""Send in the troops[13],"" The New York Timeseditorial page editor, James Bennet, who allowed for its publication, was ousted out of his position. Even though senator did not call for ""military force against protesters in American cities[14],"" but spoke of a ""show of force"" needed, in his opinion, to manage a situation, which a considerable part of the country saw as spiraling out of control, some of the Times' staffersfelt threatened[15]: ""Running this puts Black @NYTimes staff in danger,"" tweeted many of them.Out of fear of getting in trouble by bringing up anything even remotely controversial, journalists are twisting themselves into knots by presenting us with mind-blowing titles such as ""27 police officers injured during largely peaceful anti-racism protests in London[16]."" This is the BBC, the world's largest broadcast news organization, that generates about 120 hours of radio and television output each day, as well as online news coverage, and has an annual budget of 350million (roughly $432 million). How about MSNBC'sAli Velshi reporting[17]in front of the burning police precinct headquarters that the ""protests"" are ""not generally speaking unruly""?...""Largely peaceful"" has become one of the big lies of the left when describing the riots and destruction wrought by the tantrum that grew out of the George Floyd death in the custody of the police. The Washington Post described the riots in DC as ""largely peaceful"" ignoring the 150 casualties of police that required trips to the hospital and the nearly 50 secret service agents injured by the rioters. Not to mention burned buildings and discretion of monuments by the ""largely peaceful"" mob.

The dismaying death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and the nationwide demonstrations that followed have roused once reluctant lawmakers and even a president who preaches law and order to push now for police reforms.
The way Floyd, who is black, was pressed prone into the street, the way the white officer stared at the bystander's camera as he dug his knee into Floyd's neck while the man cried for his mother, for air, for his life, made for a moment that could not be ignored.
It drew together by the thousands people of all races who poured into America's streets to express outrage and anger, and those demonstrations spread globally. And it led to a swift push for action from many lawmakers who rarely agree on much of anything.
“There are thousands of people marching in the streets, demanding meaningful change. People are demanding action,” said Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. “We've seen enough. We've had enough commissions. We have studied these issues. We have convened opinion leaders. We have talked about these in private conversations and in public conversations. Now is time to act.”
Few changes of heart have come so quickly, especially in the highly polarized era in Washington. Lawmakers are pushing for legislation to change police procedures, President Donald Trump signed an executive order, and both sides are claiming the mantle of police reform.
Public opinion has shifted. About half of American adults now say police violence against the public is a “very” or “extremely” serious problem, up from about a third as recently as September last year, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Only about 3 in 10 said the same in July 2015.
“Is policing in America a systematically racist enterprise? I’d like to think not,” Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Tuesday. “Because I do believe most cops are far more good than bad. But when every black man in America believes that getting stopped by the cops is a traumatic experience, something happened.”
Graham talked about how he's rarely pulled over by police and when he is, “there is literally no fear.”
""I wouldn't like to live in a country where I'd be afraid to be stopped,"" Graham said.
Police reform has gone from an issue that fractured Congress to one where both parties speak in unison about the need for action. Both the Democrats and Republicans have unveiled bills meant to bring major changes in how officers interact with communities, including accountability for misconduct and training on how to de-escalate tense situations. While Democrats have pushed for reforms before, the dueling bills both push core changes that would have been unheard of a few years ago.
Trump's executive order establishes a database that tracks police officers with excessive use-of-force complaints in their records. Many officers who wind up involved in fatal interactions have long complaint histories, including Derek Chauvin, the white Minneapolis police officer charged with murder in Floyd’s death. Those records are often not made public, making it difficult to know if an officer has such a history.
The executive order gives police departments a financial incentive to adopt best practices and encourage co-responder programs, in which social workers join police when they respond to nonviolent calls involving mental health, addiction and homelessness issues.
That idea has been percolating in communities of color and among activists for decades. And the proposed changes, banning chokeholds, for example, have already been made in many police departments. Some cities have pushed for de-escalation tactics, and others, like Camden, New Jersey, have dismantled departments and started over.
So there is little new in the case of Floyd, though something about it was so visceral and vivid that it could not be ignored. It pushed law enforcement leaders nationwide to speak out publicly when they have kept silent before, and it has forced lawmakers into introspection.
It also resurfaced other stories, from professional and working-class black men, of routine mistreatment at the hands of police. Even Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., has talked about his experiences as a black man being stopped in the U.S. Capitol.
And then there are the deaths. Some aren't caught on video, like Ramarley Graham in New York City, who was shot to death in his own bathroom in 2012, not far from his little brother and grandmother. Or Freddie Gray in Baltimore, who died in the back of a police car.
But some are captured on camera: Philando Castile's death in Minneapolis on livestream in 2016. Eric Garner in New York. Laquan McDonald in Chicago.
And 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Cleveland, playing with a toy gun, was shot to death by a police officer in 2014.
These, too, have prompted protests. They gave birth to the Black Lives Matter movement. The Obama administration created a task force on police reform, and the Justice Department opened up nearly two dozen civil rights investigations into policing.
But there was a fractured Congress and lack of overwhelming public support. In 2012, Illinois Rep. Bobby Rush was removed from the House floor after he wore a hoodie while calling for an investigation into the shooting of Trayvon Martin.
Congress in 2015 and 2016 was instead focused on the Blue Lives Matter act, which would have made an attack on a police officer a hate crime. More than a dozen states passed similar laws after a spate of police killings. Congress passed a version of the law last year.
Then came the 2016 presidential election of Trump, and political and racial divisions became more fraught. Police reform was a decidedly lower Washington priority.
Until Floyd uttered the same words Eric Garner did before he died: “I can't breathe.”
However late, police reform academics and activists are heartened by the push and the sudden coalescing around the issue.
“I am cautiously optimistic,"" said Durham, N.C. Police Chief Cerelyn Davis, the president of the National Order of Black Law Enforcement Executives. ""That the cries of our America will be heard and acted upon so that once and for all black lives are valued in the eyes of the police, as more than a counterfeit 20-dollar bill, more than a carton of cigarettes, and more important than simply showing up at the wrong address.”

 It's a holiday miracle! In 2020, some Republicans have gone from racist to post-racial.
 Certainly not every Republican is racist. Yet too many of them tolerate racism, pander to racists and downplay the racial antics of others.
 Now some in the GOP have found religion. Who knew that the party whose bread-and-butter voter is a disgruntled white male who feels victimized by everything from globalization to diversity training could fall so hard for the vision conveyed almost 60 years ago by a Black preacher?
 ""I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character,"" said the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in his famous address during the 1963 March on Washington.
 If I hear one more white male conservative radio host appropriate King's words to attack racial and ethnic diversity in everything from corporate boards to presidential appointments, I'm going to scream.
 From 1980 to 2020, many in the GOP didn't judge people ""by the content of their character."" Colorblind, they were not.
 In the 1980s, Republican President Ronald Reagan unleashed the Justice Department to dismantle affirmative action, minority scholarships and other programs intended to expand opportunities for people of color because, the argument went, these initiatives promoted reverse discrimination against white people.
 In the 1990s, Republican Gov. Pete Wilson of California pushed two racially charged initiatives: Proposition 187, which sought to deny services to illegal immigrants and their children (most of whom, the campaign reminded us, are Latino); and Proposition 209, which eliminated racial and ethnic preferences in state-run education, hiring and contracting.
 In the 2000s, Republicans competed to see who was toughest on illegal immigration (most of which comes from Mexico and Latin America). This happened, most notably, during the 2008 GOP presidential primary. Meanwhile, in Congress, Republicans opposed a hate crimes bill and legislation that made it easier for plaintiffs to sue for discrimination.
 In the 2010s, Republicans in Arizona and a handful of other states passed legislation that empowered local and state police to use ethnic profiling in enforcing federal immigration laws, while New York real estate tycoon Donald Trump ran for president in 2016 on a promise to crack down on ""bad hombres"" bringing crime and drugs across the U.S.-Mexico border.
 Now, here we are in 2020. And white Republicans want us to forget all that history and sing ""Kumbaya.""
 This year, when I write about race or immigration, I've been hearing a lot from white men who support Trump and identify themselves as conservatives. They want me to know that they see Hispanics as ""white"" and U.S. citizens who just are one or two generations away from their immigrant roots as full-fledged Americans.
 What a momentous if somewhat confusing development this must be for my parent's tribe, the so-called silent generation, whose members now are in their late 70s and early 80s, and include President-elect Joe Biden. That generation of Hispanics - which suffered overt discrimination - if full of desperate souls who spent much of their lives either trying to be white or be accepted as Americans. Now, they've arrived. Apparently.
 This new way of thinking by white conservatives seems to have been triggered by a few things.
 There is the 2020 U.S. census, which is expected to record that the United States continues its march to becoming a country where - as early as 2045 - whites will represent a statistical minority.
 Also, in May, there was the killing of George Floyd by a white police officer in Minneapolis, which sparked protests and riots. It started a national conversation about race and policing.
 Next came the 2020 election, with headlines about the complexity of the ""Latino vote"" and stories about how African Americans saved Biden's presidential bid in South Carolina.
 Finally, let's remember that Vice President-elect Kamala Harris is a Black woman as the daughter of immigrants. For white men who feel displaced or marginalized, that's a triple trigger.
 Color me skeptical. But I don't trust this conversion. This new spirit of inclusion appears fueled by the same thing that fueled decades of intolerance: fear. Only now, instead of worrying about crime or demographics or invasions, white people are afraid of being replaced.
 That fear is ridiculous. Just like all the others.

In 1934, bank robber John Dillinger was shot to death by federal agents outside Chicago’s Biograph Theater, where he had just seen the Clark Gable movie “Manhattan Melodrama.”
In 1937, the U.S. Senate rejected President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s proposal to add more justices to the Supreme Court.
In 1942, the Nazis began transporting Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto to the Treblinka concentration camp. Gasoline rationing involving the use of coupons began along the Atlantic seaboard.
In 1946, the militant Zionist group Irgun blew up a wing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, killing 91 people.
In 1957, Walter “Fred” Morrison applied for a patent for a “flying toy” which became known as the Frisbee.
In 1967, American author, historian and poet Carl Sandburg died at his North Carolina home at age 89.
In 1975, the House of Representatives joined the Senate in voting to restore the American citizenship of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.
In 1991, police in Milwaukee arrested Jeffrey Dahmer, who later confessed to murdering 17 men and boys (Dahmer ended up being beaten to death by a fellow prison inmate).
In 1992, Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar escaped from his luxury prison near Medellin (meh-deh-YEEN’). (He was slain by security forces in December 1993.)
In 2011, Anders Breivik (AHN’-durs BRAY’-vihk), a self-described “militant nationalist,” massacred 69 people at a Norwegian island youth retreat after detonating a bomb in nearby Oslo that killed eight others in the nation’s worst violence since World War II.
Ten years ago: President Hugo Chavez severed Venezuela’s diplomatic relations with neighboring Colombia over claims he was harboring leftist guerrillas. The city manager, assistant manager and police chief of Bell, California, resigned after outraged residents found out through a Los Angeles Times investigation that the officials were making a total of more than $1.6 million a year. Six people were killed when a Greyhound bus crashed into an overturned SUV on a highway in Fresno, California. (Authorities later said the SUV driver, who died in the collision, was drunk.)
Five years ago: A Soyuz space capsule blasted off for the International Space Station, docking with the orbiting outpost nearly six hours later. Prosecutors in Colorado urged the death penalty for Aurora movie theater shooter James Holmes, saying he deliberately and cruelly killed 12 people (Holmes ended up being sentenced to life in prison when the jury could not unanimously agree on execution). A federal grand jury indictment charged Dylann Roof, the young man accused of killing nine Black church members in Charleston, South Carolina, with 33 counts including hate crimes that made him eligible for the death penalty. (Roof would become the first person sentenced to death for a federal hate crime; he is on death row at a federal prison in Indiana.)
One year ago: Teammates, family and friends gathered at a Catholic church in Santa Monica, California, to mourn Los Angeles Angels pitcher Tyler Skaggs, who had been found dead in his Texas hotel room on July 1. “Old Town Road,” by Lil Nas X, remained at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart for a 16th week, tying a record set by Mariah Carey and Luis Fonsi.

And then there are the deaths. Some aren't caught on video, like Ramarley Graham's in New York City. He was shot to death in his bathroom in 2012, not far from his little brother and grandmother. Or Freddie Gray's in Baltimore. He died in the back of a police van.
But some are captured on camera: Philando Castile's death in Minneapolis on livestream in 2016. Eric Garner's in New York. Laquan McDonald's in Chicago.
And 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Cleveland, playing with a toy gun, was shot to death by a police officer in 2014.
These, too, have prompted protests. They gave birth to the Black Lives Matter movement. The Obama administration created a task force on police reform, and the Justice Department opened up nearly two dozen civil rights investigations into policing.
But there was a fractured Congress and lack of overwhelming public support. In 2012, Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., was removed from the House floor after he wore a hoodie while calling for an investigation into the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.
Congress in 2015 and 2016 was instead focused on the Blue Lives Matter act, which would have made an attack on a police officer a hate crime. More than a dozen states passed similar laws after a spate of police killings. Congress passed a version of the law last year.
Then came Trump's election, and political and racial divisions became more fraught. Police reform was a decidedly lower Washington priority.
Until Floyd uttered the same words Garner did before he died: “I can't breathe.”
However late, police reform academics and activists are heartened by the push and the sudden coalescing around the issue.
“I am cautiously optimistic,"" said Durham, North Carolina, Police Chief Cerelyn Davis, the president of the National Order of Black Law Enforcement Executives. ""That the cries of our America will be heard and acted upon so that once and for all black lives are valued in the eyes of the police, as more than a counterfeit 20-dollar bill, more than a carton of cigarettes, and more important than simply showing up at the wrong address.”

Today’s Highlight in History:
On July 22, 1862, President Abraham Lincoln presented to his Cabinet a preliminary draft of the Emancipation Proclamation.
On this date:
In 1587, an English colony fated to vanish under mysterious circumstances was established on Roanoke Island off North Carolina.
In 1933, American aviator Wiley Post completed the first solo flight around the world as he returned to New York’s Floyd Bennett Field after traveling for 7 days, 18 and 3/4 hours.
In 1934, bank robber John Dillinger was shot to death by federal agents outside Chicago’s Biograph Theater, where he had just seen the Clark Gable movie “Manhattan Melodrama.”
In 1937, the U.S. Senate rejected President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s proposal to add more justices to the Supreme Court.
In 1942, the Nazis began transporting Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto to the Treblinka concentration camp. Gasoline rationing involving the use of coupons began along the Atlantic seaboard.
In 1946, the militant Zionist group Irgun blew up a wing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, killing 91 people.
In 1957, Walter “Fred” Morrison applied for a patent for a “flying toy” which became known as the Frisbee.
In 1967, American author, historian and poet Carl Sandburg died at his North Carolina home at age 89.
In 1975, the House of Representatives joined the Senate in voting to restore the American citizenship of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.
In 1991, police in Milwaukee arrested Jeffrey Dahmer, who later confessed to murdering 17 men and boys (Dahmer ended up being beaten to death by a fellow prison inmate).
In 1992, Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar escaped from his luxury prison near Medellin (meh-deh-YEEN’). (He was slain by security forces in December 1993.)
In 2011, Anders Breivik (AHN’-durs BRAY’-vihk), a self-described “militant nationalist,” massacred 69 people at a Norwegian island youth retreat after detonating a bomb in nearby Oslo that killed eight others in the nation’s worst violence since World War II.
Ten years ago: President Hugo Chavez severed Venezuela’s diplomatic relations with neighboring Colombia over claims he was harboring leftist guerrillas. The city manager, assistant manager and police chief of Bell, California, resigned after outraged residents found out through a Los Angeles Times investigation that the officials were making a total of more than $1.6 million a year. Six people were killed when a Greyhound bus crashed into an overturned SUV on a highway in Fresno, California. (Authorities later said the SUV driver, who died in the collision, was drunk.)
Five years ago: A Soyuz space capsule blasted off for the International Space Station, docking with the orbiting outpost nearly six hours later. Prosecutors in Colorado urged the death penalty for Aurora movie theater shooter James Holmes, saying he deliberately and cruelly killed 12 people (Holmes ended up being sentenced to life in prison when the jury could not unanimously agree on execution). A federal grand jury indictment charged Dylann Roof, the young man accused of killing nine Black church members in Charleston, South Carolina, with 33 counts including hate crimes that made him eligible for the death penalty. (Roof would become the first person sentenced to death for a federal hate crime; he is on death row at a federal prison in Indiana.)
One year ago: Teammates, family and friends gathered at a Catholic church in Santa Monica, California, to mourn Los Angeles Angels pitcher Tyler Skaggs, who had been found dead in his Texas hotel room on July 1. “Old Town Road,” by Lil Nas X, remained at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart for a 16th week, tying a record set by Mariah Carey and Luis Fonsi. Equifax agreed to pay at least $700 million to settle lawsuits over a 2017 data breach that exposed the Social Security numbers and other private information of nearly 150 million Americans.

 It's a holiday miracle! In 2020, some Republicans have gone from racist to post-racial.
 Certainly not every Republican is racist. Yet too many of them tolerate racism, pander to racists and downplay the racial antics of others.
 Now some in the GOP have found religion. Who knew that the party whose bread-and-butter voter is a disgruntled white male who feels victimized by everything from globalization to diversity training could fall so hard for the vision conveyed almost 60 years ago by a Black preacher?
 ""I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character,"" said the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in his famous address during the 1963 March on Washington.
 If I hear one more white male conservative radio host appropriate King's words to attack racial and ethnic diversity in everything from corporate boards to presidential appointments, I'm going to scream.
 From 1980 to 2020, many in the GOP didn't judge people ""by the content of their character."" Colorblind, they were not.
 In the 1980s, Republican President Ronald Reagan unleashed the Justice Department to dismantle affirmative action, minority scholarships and other programs intended to expand opportunities for people of color because, the argument went, these initiatives promoted reverse discrimination against white people.
 In the 1990s, Republican Gov. Pete Wilson of California pushed two racially charged initiatives: Proposition 187, which sought to deny services to illegal immigrants and their children (most of whom, the campaign reminded us, are Latino); and Proposition 209, which eliminated racial and ethnic preferences in state-run education, hiring and contracting.
 In the 2000s, Republicans competed to see who was toughest on illegal immigration (most of which comes from Mexico and Latin America). This happened, most notably, during the 2008 GOP presidential primary. Meanwhile, in Congress, Republicans opposed a hate crimes bill and legislation that made it easier for plaintiffs to sue for discrimination.
 In the 2010s, Republicans in Arizona and a handful of other states passed legislation that empowered local and state police to use ethnic profiling in enforcing federal immigration laws, while New York real estate tycoon Donald Trump ran for president in 2016 on a promise to crack down on ""bad hombres"" bringing crime and drugs across the U.S.-Mexico border.
 Now, here we are in 2020. And white Republicans want us to forget all that history and sing ""Kumbaya.""
 This year, when I write about race or immigration, I've been hearing a lot from white men who support Trump and identify themselves as conservatives. They want me to know that they see Hispanics as ""white"" and U.S. citizens who just are one or two generations away from their immigrant roots as full-fledged Americans.
 What a momentous if somewhat confusing development this must be for my parent's tribe, the so-called silent generation, whose members now are in their late 70s and early 80s, and include President-elect Joe Biden. That generation of Hispanics - which suffered overt discrimination - if full of desperate souls who spent much of their lives either trying to be white or be accepted as Americans. Now, they've arrived. Apparently.
 This new way of thinking by white conservatives seems to have been triggered by a few things.
 There is the 2020 U.S. census, which is expected to record that the United States continues its march to becoming a country where - as early as 2045 - whites will represent a statistical minority.
 Also, in May, there was the killing of George Floyd by a white police officer in Minneapolis, which sparked protests and riots. It started a national conversation about race and policing.
 Next came the 2020 election, with headlines about the complexity of the ""Latino vote"" and stories about how African Americans saved Biden's presidential bid in South Carolina.
 Finally, let's remember that Vice President-elect Kamala Harris is a Black woman as the daughter of immigrants. For white men who feel displaced or marginalized, that's a triple trigger.
 Color me skeptical. But I don't trust this conversion. This new spirit of inclusion appears fueled by the same thing that fueled decades of intolerance: fear. Only now, instead of worrying about crime or demographics or invasions, white people are afraid of being replaced.
 That fear is ridiculous. Just like all the others.

The Post and Courier on remembering the nine African American parishioners at Charleston’s Emanuel AME Church who were massacred by a white supremacist:
Most of us remember where we were and what we were doing on the evening of June 17, 2015, when nine African American parishioners at Charleston’s Emanuel AME Church were gunned down during a Bible study.
As the fifth anniversary arrives, it doesn’t feel like enough simply to remember that horrible crime, especially as a fresh wave of racial tension breaks over this country.
The latest unrest has been triggered by last month’s death of George Floyd at the hands of a white Minneapolis police officer. To many protesters, his death is part of a larger pattern, one that includes too many widely reported, hate-driven deaths of African Americans, including those killed by a white supremacist inside Emanuel.
So we need to remember more than that tragic day and those lives lost and irrevocably changed. We need to remember the goal of the pathetic criminal — to start a race war — and to rededicate ourselves to empathy, understanding and goodwill. We need to rededicate ourselves to fighting hate.
It is heartening to see so many survivors and relatives doing just that, in their own way.
As The Post and Courier’s Jennifer Berry Hawes reports, Tyrone and Felicia Sanders, who lost their son Tywanza, 26, find hope in his namesake foundation, which awards college scholarships and supports a camp for entrepreneurs. Jennifer Pinckney, widow of Pastor Clementa Pinckney, has focused on their daughters. The Rev. Anthony Thompson, who lost his wife, Myra, wrote a book, “Called to Forgive.” The Rev. Sharon Risher and Chris Singleton also have written books.
Rev. Thompson also speaks together often with survivor Polly Sheppard to spread the message about the power of faith. “That’s where I’m at now when it comes to remembering, it’s about helping people,” he told Ms. Hawes.
Those stories are just a slice of how they are picking up the pieces and trying to turn an unimaginable loss into something good, or at least not as bad.
Most of us did not have a family member inside Emanuel that evening, but we all share a sense of loss and grief. And on this anniversary, we all can do something in our own way to try to improve things, whether it’s forging new relationships, becoming more politically active or providing fresh support for a good cause.
There is hope that something good will come out of all this nation’s anguish over the death of Mr. Floyd and other tragedies, including the one that unfolded in downtown Charleston five years ago.
U.S. House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn told our Jamie Lovegrove essentially what so many others have said in recent weeks: This time feels different.
“I spend quite a bit of time researching and reflecting upon our country’s history, and I cannot think of any other time that this kind of reexamination has taken place,” Mr. Clyburn said.
This may indeed be a unique opportunity to make progress on matters of justice and equity — to help build a better America. In doing so, we should draw inspiration from the living victims of the Emanuel tragedy and the example they continue to set of empathy, love and hope.

The Los Angles Times on two black men found dead, hanging from trees:
The image of a Black man hanging from a tree is seared into the American psyche as the embodiment of racism in all its ugliness and cruelty. Lynchings of African Americans through the civil rights era of the 1960s challenged the nation’s perception of itself as the land of liberty, justice, equality and rule of law, and we have seen to our horror that even today, racial hatred can still descend to murder.
So even if a hanging in the Antelope Valley might look at the authorities’ first glance like suicide, that simply must not be the end of it. There must be a thorough probe, and findings must be made public.
The body of 24-year-old Robert Fuller was found June 10 in a tree near Palmdale City Hall. Officials quickly labeled it a suicide, but protesters to their credit immediately demanded a deeper investigation. So did Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger.
How likely is it that a man would hang himself from a tree? It is not unheard of, but it is hardly reassuring to note that two weeks earlier the body of 38-year-old Malcolm Harsch was found hanging from a tree in Victorville, a desert city at the opposite end of the storied Pearblossom Highway from Palmdale. Coincidence is possible. But so is a pattern. We don’t have enough information yet to know. Until a generation ago, much of the desert just north of Los Angeles and San Bernardino was dotted with mostly white communities that attracted families seeking homes that were more affordable and a lifestyle that was less urban than what was found in the packed cities south of the mountains. They were joined in the 1980s by a large migration from L.A. of Black families. The relatively quick demographic change brought some tension and several instances of violence.
L.A. County Dist. Atty. Jackie Lacey is today vocally opposed by protesters angry that she has not prosecuted police who have killed unarmed Black men. But as a young deputy district attorney assigned to Lancaster (not far from Palmdale), she prosecuted the killers of a homeless man whom they had met at a McDonald’s. Lacey said that they had set out to kill a Black man and that, when they had done it, they celebrated by getting tattoos. Lacey won the county’s first hate crime convictions.
“Here we are in the 1990s, in Southern California,” she recounted as a candidate in 2012, “and you have a racist group that has decided to murder people much the way they did in the South and got away with it in the ’50s. The verdict was about this: We are not going back there. Justice will be served. It was a message to anyone else out there who would even think of engaging in this behavior — that we’re just not going back there.”
That’s a sentiment that ought to ring true today: We will not go back there. Those are the words that ought to be on our minds when we see the videotaped killing of Ahmaud Arbery, who was chased down this year by white men in Georgia and shot to death. We will not go back there — and yet here we are. Arbery’s killing has the look and feel of a lynching, even if in this instance there was no rope and no tree.
That was the South, but those same words echo when we see the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. And yes, Floyd was killed not by a lynch mob but by a police officer. Yet the brutality and gratuitousness of the killing lend it the caustic flavor of a lynching. We will not go back there, yet here we are.
People around the nation are marching in resolve and anger against the continuing individual and institutional — and deadly — anti-Black racism still ingrained in our society. We struggle with the lines that separate the killing of people like Breonna Taylor in her own home by police officers from the killing of people like Arbery by civilians.
So we do not — we must not — simply shrug and say “suicide” when Black men are found hanging in trees. We leave no stone unturned until we can determine conclusively that these men were not killed by others, but by themselves.
And then, if we conclude that it could not have been murder but must have been suicide, we must recognize that our work is not done. We will have to ask ourselves: Why would a young Black man in the 21st century United States kill himself? Suicide in the Black community was historically low but is on the rise, especially among teenagers and young adults. Where did we go wrong? And, whether it be murder or suicide, how do we prevent such a thing from happening again?

Valdosta Daily Times on commemorating Juneteenth:
On Jan. 1, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, announcing all persons held as slaves within the rebellious areas are and henceforth shall be free.
A political move by Lincoln, the proclamation did not end slavery immediately or in all states, but it served as a rallying cry for Union troops and for blacks to fight on the side of the Union to win their freedom.
The Civil War did not officially end until June 2, 1865, and word of the Emancipation Proclamation did not reach the last stronghold of slavery, in Galveston, Texas, until June 19, 1865, more than two and a half years after it was issued.
“The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a Proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and free laborer.”
So began General Order Number 3, as read by Major Gen. Gordon Granger on June 19, 1865.
It was on this date that Union soldiers landed at Galveston, Texas, with news the Civil War had ended and the enslaved were now free — again, two and a half years after President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation, which became official Jan. 1, 1863.
The annual celebration of the events of June 19, 1865, is most commonly known as Juneteenth. It’s the oldest known celebration commemorating the ending of slavery in the United States. ...
Juneteenth has become a day of freedom — a day marking the liberation from American slavery, and now a day symbolically marking the liberation from racism and prejudice.

The Guardian on journalist Maria Ressa being found guilty of “cyber libel” in the Philippines:
The persecution of the courageous journalist Maria Ressa in the Philippines should not only horrify her compatriots and her counterparts elsewhere. The conviction of Ms Ressa and a former colleague for cyberlibel this week, which could see them serve up to six years in prison, is designed to chill the media. But it should reverberate throughout her nation and more widely, because it forms part of a broader assault on democracy.
Having overthrown dictatorship three decades ago, the Philippines is now regressing under its authoritarian but popular president, Rodrigo Duterte. His brutal “war on drugs,” with its thousands of extrajudicial killings, has been accompanied by a relentless campaign against those who have dared to challenge it or otherwise criticise him.
As president-elect, Mr Duterte suggested that corrupt journalists were “not exempted” from assassination and told reporters: “You won’t be killed if you don’t do anything wrong.” The leading broadcaster ABS-CBN was forced off air last month when its licence was not renewed.
Rappler, the news website headed by Ms Ressa, has already faced verbal attacks by Mr Duterte, multiple investigations, tax fraud charges and the revocation of its licence. Amnesty has described this week’s verdict as a sham. The Philippines has signed treaties that outlaw jailing people for libel. The article, which alleged ties between a businessman and a high court judge, was not authored by Ms Ressa herself. It appeared years before the legislation on cyberlibel had been passed. Yet the court accepted that Rappler had “republished” it because a single spelling mistake was corrected. Ms Ressa is now appealing.
This is, as she has said, an existential moment for journalism and for democracy. The country’s legislature has just passed a draconian anti-terrorism bill allowing the surveillance, warrantless arrest and detention of “suspicious” individuals. Human rights defenders say it will give authorities carte blanche to target those who criticise them online. ....
Under another president, the US would strongly press Manila over Ms Ressa’s case. But Donald Trump loves authoritarians and has normalised and enabled the abuses of press freedom that are now increasing worldwide. As his administration stands by, making only the most feeble statement, others must take a stand. While the UK has rightly expressed concern about the case, it should now work with others to defend media freedom.
It is not merely that Ms Ressa and her colleagues need and deserve support: her case has such frightening implications beyond her own country. When Mr Duterte is given a free pass for his behaviour, other leaders take note. Without freedom of the media, it is impossible to protect other freedoms: citizens cannot know what is being done in their name. Journalists are targeted because they sound the alarm. They must not be silenced.

The New York Times on a Supreme Court ruling barring employers from firing workers for being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender:
In an emphatic win for civil rights, equal justice and common sense, the Supreme Court ruled on Monday that federal law bars employers from firing workers for being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.
The vote was 6 to 3. It should have been unanimous.
As Justice Neil Gorsuch explained for the court’s majority, the right result could not be clearer. The federal law at issue, Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, prohibits employment discrimination “because of sex.” And “an employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex,” Justice Gorsuch wrote. “Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids.”
In separate cases consolidated for argument, three plaintiffs — two gay men and a transgender woman — had sued their employers for firing them after learning of their sexual orientation or transgender status.
It does not matter, the court said, whether the employer might have had additional reasons for the firing. “Intentionally burning down a neighbor’s house is arson, even if the perpetrator’s ultimate intention (or motivation) is only to improve the view,” Justice Gorsuch wrote.
Nor can an employer avoid the law’s prohibition by claiming it treats all men the same or all women the same. The bottom line, he wrote, is that Congress wrote a law with intentionally broad language, and “ours is a society of written laws.”
Monday’s decision will soon have ripple effects, including the likely invalidation of the Trump administration’s decision last week to eliminate protections against discrimination in health care for transgender patients.
In a lengthy dissent that sounded like it was written in 1964, Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, argued that the court’s job is to interpret statutes to “mean what they conveyed to reasonable people at the time they were written.” It’s hard to imagine these justices applying the same logic to the meaning of the Second Amendment, which reasonable people at the time understood to apply to bayonets and muskets. But we digress.
Justice Alito’s point was that the lawmakers who passed the Civil Rights Act could not possibly have anticipated “sex” to cover discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.
That’s true, of course. They also could not have imagined that it would cover sexual harassment of male employees — and yet in 1998 the Supreme Court found unanimously that it did. “Statutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably comparable evils, and it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed,” the court said then, in an opinion written by Justice Antonin Scalia.
Justice Gorsuch, who succeeded Justice Scalia on the bench, reiterated this basic concept on Monday: “The limits of the drafters’ imagination supply no reason to ignore the law’s demands. When the express terms of a statute give us one answer and extratextual considerations suggest another, it’s no contest. Only the written word is the law, and all persons are entitled to its benefit.”
While we’re on the subject of legislators’ intentions, it is worth noting the historical irony behind the inclusion of “sex” in the civil rights law — which was, after all, targeted primarily at racial discrimination. The term was added at the last minute by Representative Howard Smith, a staunch segregationist from Virginia, in the hope that lawmakers would see it as a bridge too far and vote down the entire bill. Mr. Smith’s failed gambit continues to pay off in ways that he surely never could have dreamed.
Still, there are reasons to be cautious.
Justice Gorsuch’s commitment to textualism, a method of interpreting laws by looking solely to their plain words, achieved a just result in this case, but when applied too rigidly it can lead to very unjust results. In his previous job on a federal appeals court, then-Judge Gorsuch wrote an opinion holding that a trucker could legally be fired for abandoning his broken-down truck in subzero temperatures — based on a wooden reading of the word “operate.” In short, this particular victory for gay rights was based not on the fundamental equality or dignity of gay and transgender Americans, as previous Supreme Court decisions have been; it was based on the meaning of a single word.
The opinion also hints at a potentially serious obstacle on the horizon: claims by employers that being prohibited from discriminating against gay and transgender workers violates their religious convictions. Such claims are likely to find a sympathetic ear among this Supreme Court’s conservative majority, which has repeatedly voted to protect if not promote religion and religious objectors.
For now, however, Monday’s decision is a victory to savor, the next major step in a line of gay rights decisions stretching back nearly a quarter century, and until now written solely by Justice Anthony Kennedy.
Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who succeeded Justice Kennedy in 2018, graciously admitted as much in his own dissent. Although he disagreed with the majority’s opinion, he wrote: “It is appropriate to acknowledge the important victory achieved today by gay and lesbian Americans. Millions of gay and lesbian Americans have worked hard for many decades to achieve equal treatment in fact and in law. They have exhibited extraordinary vision, tenacity and grit — battling often steep odds in the legislative and judicial arenas, not to mention in their daily lives. They have advanced powerful policy arguments and can take pride in today’s result.”
Take pride, indeed.

The Wall Street Journal on a possible second wave of COVID-19 cases:
Stocks sold off Thursday amid investor worries that a “second wave” of coronavirus infections could cause countries and states that are reopening to lock down again. But headlines about a coronavirus resurgence in the U.S. are overblown so far, and the bigger threat is keeping the economy in a coma.
“We know as a fact that reopening other states we’re seeing significant problems,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday. “Twelve states that reopened are now seeing spikes. This is a very real possibility.” This is Mr. Cuomo’s excuse for keeping New York City in lockdown purgatory for 12 weeks as other states reopen and their economies rebound.
Democrats cite a spike in cases in Florida, Arizona and Texas as evidence of a virus resurgence. But more testing, especially in vulnerable communities, is naturally turning up more cases. Cases in Texas have increased by about a third in the last two weeks, but so have tests. About a quarter of the new cases are in counties with large prisons and meatpacking plants that were never forced to shut down.
Tests have increased by about 37% in Florida in two weeks, but confirmed cases have risen 28%. ... In Arizona, cases have increased by 73% in the last two weeks though tests have increased by just 53%. But a quarter of all cases in the state are on Indian reservations, which have especially high-risk populations. ...
Liberals and the media demanded more testing before states could reopen, yet now are criticizing states because more testing has turned up more cases. Keep in mind that New York has reported about the same number of new cases in the last two weeks as Florida, though it ramped up testing earlier so the relative increase appears less significant.
A more important metric is hospitalizations. In Arizona the weekly rolling average for new Covid-19 hospitalizations has been flat for a month. Emergency-room visits for Covid-19 have spiked this week, but the number of ER beds in use hasn’t changed since late April. ...
Texas has also recently reported an uptick in Covid-19 hospitalizations, mostly in the Houston and Austin areas. Current Covid-19 hospitalizations are up about 20% since the state began to reopen, but Gov. Greg Abbott says hospitals aren’t overwhelmed and much of the increase is tied to nursing homes. ....
Fatalities are a lagging epidemic indicator since most people who die have been in the hospital for two to three weeks. But deaths also aren’t surging. Texas has recorded 151 deaths this past week versus 221 in the last week of April. Florida has reported 239 deaths, 72 fewer than in the last week of April.
Deaths are probably declining in part from better and earlier treatment, but this means there’s less to fear from reopening. While Arizona has reported 114 deaths—43 more than in the last week of April—its deaths per capita are similar to the 325 that New York has reported in the past week.
Mr. Cuomo over the weekend boasted that New York “did the impossible” and “crushed” the coronavirus curve. New York has made enormous progress since the early days of the pandemic, which hit the state harder and earlier because of its population density, mass transit and international travel. We aren’t among the revisionists who say Mr. Cuomo should have locked down New York earlier.
But other states that didn’t impose strict lockdowns and have been gradually reopening have kept the epidemic under control and not paid as high an economic price. Some 7.3% of workers in Arizona and Florida and 11.4% in Texas were collecting unemployment benefits in late May compared to 18.7% in New York.
More infections are inevitable as states reopen, and there will be much trial and error. States need to be vigilant for outbreaks and protect high-risk areas and the vulnerable. But the costs of shutting down the economy are so great, in damage to lives and livelihoods, that there is no alternative to opening for the broader public good.

78,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1001/Files (250).DOCX","Associated Press International",2020-06-17,"1077 words","POLITICAL NEWS","COLLEEN LONG, Associated Press",NA,"Analysis: Washington wakes up to need for police reform",FALSE,"WASHINGTON (AP) — It looks like Washington has finally woken up.
The dismaying death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and the nationwide demonstrations that followed have roused once reluctant lawmakers and even a president who preaches law and order to push now for police reforms.
The way Floyd, who is black, was pressed prone into the street, the way the white officer stared at the bystander's camera as he dug his knee into Floyd's neck while the man cried for his mother, for air, for his life, made for a moment that could not be ignored.
It drew together by the thousands people of all races who poured into America's streets to express outrage and anger, and those demonstrations spread globally. And it led to a swift push for action from many lawmakers who rarely agree on much of anything.
“There are thousands of people marching in the streets, demanding meaningful change. People are demanding action,” said Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. “We've seen enough. We've had enough commissions. We have studied these issues. We have convened opinion leaders. We have talked about these in private conversations and in public conversations. Now is time to act.”
Few changes of heart have come so quickly, especially in the highly polarized era in Washington. Lawmakers are pushing for legislation to change police procedures, President Donald Trump signed an executive order, and both sides are claiming the mantle of police reform.
Public opinion has shifted. About half of American adults now say police violence against the public is a “very” or “extremely” serious problem, up from about a third as recently as September last year, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Only about 3 in 10 said the same in July 2015.
“Is policing in America a systematically racist enterprise? I’d like to think not,” Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Tuesday. “Because I do believe most cops are far more good than bad. But when every black man in America believes that getting stopped by the cops is a traumatic experience, something happened.”
Graham talked about how he's rarely pulled over by police and when he is, “there is literally no fear.”
""I wouldn't like to live in a country where I'd be afraid to be stopped,"" Graham said.
Police reform has gone from an issue that fractured Congress to one where both parties speak in unison about the need for action. Both the Democrats and Republicans have unveiled bills meant to bring major changes in how officers interact with communities, including accountability for misconduct and training on how to de-escalate tense situations. While Democrats have pushed for reforms before, the dueling bills both push core changes that would have been unheard of a few years ago.
Trump's executive order establishes a database that tracks police officers with excessive use-of-force complaints in their records. Many officers who wind up involved in fatal interactions have long complaint histories, including Derek Chauvin, the white Minneapolis police officer charged with murder in Floyd’s death. Those records are often not made public, making it difficult to know if an officer has such a history.
The executive order gives police departments a financial incentive to adopt best practices and encourage co-responder programs, in which social workers join police when they respond to nonviolent calls involving mental health, addiction and homelessness issues.
That idea has been percolating in communities of color and among activists for decades. And the proposed changes, banning chokeholds, for example, have already been made in many police departments. Some cities have pushed for de-escalation tactics, and others, like Camden, New Jersey, have dismantled departments and started over.
So there is little new in the case of Floyd, though something about it was so visceral and vivid that it could not be ignored. It pushed law enforcement leaders nationwide to speak out publicly when they have kept silent before, and it has forced lawmakers into introspection.
It also resurfaced other stories, from professional and working-class black men, of routine mistreatment at the hands of police. Even Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., has talked about his experiences as a black man being stopped in the U.S. Capitol.
And then there are the deaths. Some aren't caught on video, like Ramarley Graham in New York City, who was shot to death in his own bathroom in 2012, not far from his little brother and grandmother. Or Freddie Gray in Baltimore, who died in the back of a police car.
But some are captured on camera: Philando Castile's death in Minneapolis on livestream in 2016. Eric Garner in New York. Laquan McDonald in Chicago.
And 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Cleveland, playing with a toy gun, was shot to death by a police officer in 2014.
These, too, have prompted protests. They gave birth to the Black Lives Matter movement. The Obama administration created a task force on police reform, and the Justice Department opened up nearly two dozen civil rights investigations into policing.
But there was a fractured Congress and lack of overwhelming public support. In 2012, Illinois Rep. Bobby Rush was removed from the House floor after he wore a hoodie while calling for an investigation into the shooting of Trayvon Martin.
Congress in 2015 and 2016 was instead focused on the Blue Lives Matter act, which would have made an attack on a police officer a hate crime. More than a dozen states passed similar laws after a spate of police killings.
Then came the 2016 presidential election of Trump, and political and racial divisions became more fraught. Police reform was a decidedly lower Washington priority.
Until Floyd uttered the same words Eric Garner did before he died: “I can't breathe.”
However late, police reform academics and activists are heartened by the push and the sudden coalescing around the issue.
“I am cautiously optimistic,"" said Durham, N.C. Police Chief Cerelyn Davis, the president of the National Order of Black Law Enforcement Executives. ""That the cries of our America will be heard and acted upon so that once and for all black lives are valued in the eyes of the police, as more than a counterfeit 20-dollar bill, more than a carton of cigarettes, and more important than simply showing up at the wrong address.”

As the US presidential election reaches its conclusion, politicians from both parties are assessing the companies' power and are looking to challenge their long-enjoyed legal protections for online speech.
The Trump administration, seizing on unfounded accusations of bias against conservative views, has asked Congress to strip some of the protections that have generally shielded the tech companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.
""The time has come for that free pass to end,"" said Senator Roger Wicker, chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. Republican Mr Wicker said the laws governing online speech must be updated because ""the openness and freedom of the internet are under attack"".
He spoke at the opening of the hearing as Twitter boss Jack Dorsey, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Sundar Pichai waited to testify via video.
Mr Wicker cited the move this month by Facebook and Twitter to limit dissemination of an unverified political story from the conservative-leaning New York Post about Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
The story, which was not confirmed by other publications, cited unverified emails from Mr Biden's son Hunter that were reportedly disclosed by president Donald Trump's allies.
Republicans, led by Mr Trump, have accused the social media platforms, without evidence, of deliberately suppressing conservative, religious and anti-abortion views. In their prepared testimony, Mr Dorsey, Mr Zuckerberg and Mr Pichai addressed the proposals for changes to a provision of a 1996 law that has served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet.
Critics in both parties say that immunity under Section 230 enables the social media companies to abdicate their responsibility to impartially moderate content.
Democrats have focused their criticism of social media mainly on hate speech, misinformation and other content that can incite violence or keep people from voting.
They have criticised the tech bosses for failing to police content, homing in on the platforms' role in hate crimes and the rise of white nationalism in the US.
Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have scrambled to stem the tide of material that incites violence and spreads lies and baseless conspiracy theories.
The companies reject accusations of bias but have wrestled with how strongly they should intervene.
They have often gone out of their way not to appear biased against conservative views - a posture that some say effectively tilts them toward those viewpoints.
The effort has been especially strained for Facebook, which was caught off guard in 2016 when it was used as a conduit by Russian agents to spread misinformation benefiting Mr Trump's presidential campaign."

AP Photo/Andrew Selsky[1] Alexander Hinton[2], Rutgers University - Newark [3] Far-right extremists have been in the news, with an alleged plot to kidnap Michigan's governor[4] and rallies[5] like the one the Proud Boys held in Portland[6] in September. With a hotly contested election underway in a polarized society, many people are concerned about violence from far-right extremists[7]. But they may not understand the real threat. The law enforcement community is among those who have failed to understand the true nature and danger of far-right extremists. Over several decades, the FBI and other federal authorities have only intermittently paid attention to[8] far-right extremists. In recent years, they have again acknowledged[9] the extent of the threat[10]. But it's not clear how long their attention will last. While researching my forthcoming book, 'It Can Happen Here: White Power and the Rising Threat of Genocide in the U.S.[11],' I discovered that there are five key mistakes people make when thinking about far-right extremists. These mistakes obscure the extremists' true danger. 
https://i0.wp.com/images.theconversation.com/files/365790/original/file-20201027-16-b770at.jpg?ssl=1 In this Jan. 18, 1986, photo, a KKK group marches in Tennessee to protest the first national observance of Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday. AP Photo/Mark Humphrey[12] 1. Some have white supremacist views, but others don'tWhen asked to condemn white supremacists and extremists at the first presidential debate[13], President Donald Trump floundered, then said, 'Give me a name.' His Democratic challenger Joe Biden offered, 'The Proud Boys[14].' Not all far-right extremists are militant white supremacists. White supremacy, the belief in white racial superiority and dominance, is a major theme of many far-right believers. Some, like the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis, are extremely hardcore hate groups[15]. Others, who at times identify themselves with the term 'alt-right[16],' often mix racism, anti-Semitism and claims of white victimization[17] in a less militant way. In addition, there are what some experts have called the 'alt-lite[18],' like the Proud Boys[19], who are less violent and disavow overt white supremacy even as they promote white power by glorifying white civilization and demonizing nonwhite people including Muslims and many immigrants. There is another major category of far-right extremists who focus more on opposing the government[20] than they do on racial differences. This so-called 'patriot movement' includes tax protesters and militias[21], many heavily armed and a portion from military and law enforcement[22] backgrounds. Some, like the Hawaiian-shirt-wearing Boogaloos[23], seek civil war to overthrow what they regard as a corrupt political order. https://i0.wp.com/images.theconversation.com/files/365792/original/file-20201027-18-kez3kw.jpg?ssl=1 During an April protest in Seattle, a boat flies the Gadsden AP Photo/Ted S. Warren[24] 2. They live in cities and towns across the nation and even the globeFar-right extremists are in communities all across America. The KKK[25], often thought of as centered in the South[26], has chapters from coast to coast. The same is true of other far-right extremist groups, as illustrated by the Southern Poverty Law Center's Hate Map[27]. Far-right extremism is also global, a point underscored by the 2011 massacre in Norway[28] and the 2019 New Zealand mosque attack[29], both of which were perpetrated by people claiming to resist 'white genocide[30].' The worldwide spread led the U.N. to recently issue a global alert[31] about the 'growing and increasing transnational threat' of right-wing extremism. https://i0.wp.com/images.theconversation.com/files/365796/original/file-20201027-22-1chvv7k.jpg?ssl=1 The 'collective delusion' known as QAnon will be around for many years. AP Photo/Ted S. Warren[32] 3. Many are well-organized, educated and social-media savvyFar-right extremists include people who write books, wear sport coats and have advanced degrees. For instance, in 1978 a physics professor turned neo-Nazi wrote a book that has been called the 'bible of the racist right[33].' Other leaders of the movement have attended elite universities[34]. Far-right extremists were early users of the internet and now thrive on social media platforms, which they use to agitate, recruit and organize. The 2017 'Unite the Right' rally in Charlottesville revealed how effectively[35] they could reach large groups and mobilize them into action. Platforms like Facebook and Twitter have recently attempted to ban[36] many of them. But the alleged Michigan kidnappers' ability to evade restrictions[37] by simply creating new pages[38] and groups has limited the companies' success[39]. https://i0.wp.com/images.theconversation.com/files/365823/original/file-20201027-24-l0vts6.jpg?ssl=1 People carrying a Nazi flag march in New York City in 1937. New York World-Telegram and the Sun Newspaper Photograph Collection/Library of Congress[40] 4. They were here long before Trump and will remain here long afterMany people associate far-right extremism with the rise of Trump. It's true that hate crimes[41], anti-Semitism[42] and the number of hate groups[43] have risen sharply since his campaign began in 2015. And the QAnon movement[44] - called both a 'collective delusion[45]' and a 'virtual cult[46]' - has gained widespread attention. But far-right extremists were here long before Trump. The history of white power extremism dates back to slave patrols and the post-Civil War rise of the KKK[47]. In the 1920s, the KKK had millions[48] of members. The following decade saw the rise of Nazi sympathizers, including 15,000 uniformed 'Silver Shirts[49]' and a 20,000 person pro-Nazi rally[50] at Madison Square Garden in New York City in 1939. While adapting to the times, far-right extremism has continued[51] into the present. It's not dependent on Trump, and will remain a threat[52] regardless of his public prominence. https://i0.wp.com/images.theconversation.com/files/365793/original/file-20201027-19-1y2naws.jpg?ssl=1 Members of the Boogaloo movement, seen here at a New Hampshire demonstration, seek a civil war in the U.S. AP Photo/Michael Dwyer[53] 5. They pose a widespread and dire threat, with some seeking civil warFar-right extremists often appear to strike[54] in spectacular 'lone wolf' attacks, like the Oklahoma City federal building bombing in 1995[55], the mass murder at a Charleston church[56] in 2015 and the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting[57] in 2018. But these people are not alone. Most far-right extremists are part of larger extremist communities[58], communicating by social media and distributing posts[59] and manifestos[60]. Their messages speak of fear that one day, whites may be outnumbered by nonwhites[61] in the U.S., and the idea that there is a Jewish-led plot to destroy the white race[62]. In response, they prepare for a war between whites and nonwhites. [Deep knowledge, daily. Sign up for The Conversation's newsletter[63].] Thinking of these extremists as loners risks missing the complexity of their networks[64], which brought as many as 13 alleged plotters together in the planning to kidnap Michigan's governor. Together, these misconceptions about far-right extremist individuals and groups can lead Americans to underestimate the dire threat they pose to the public[65]. Understanding them, by contrast, can help people and experts alike address the danger[66], as the election - and its aftermath - unfolds.

81,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1001/Files (250).DOCX","The Associated Press",2020-06-17,"1076 words","POLITICAL NEWS","COLLEEN LONG, Associated Press",NA,"Analysis: Washington wakes up to need for police reform",FALSE,"WASHINGTON — It looks like Washington has finally woken up.
The dismaying death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and the nationwide demonstrations that followed have roused once reluctant lawmakers and even a president who preaches law and order to push now for police reforms.
The way Floyd, who is black, was pressed prone into the street, the way the white officer stared at the bystander's camera as he dug his knee into Floyd's neck while the man cried for his mother, for air, for his life, made for a moment that could not be ignored.
It drew together by the thousands people of all races who poured into America's streets to express outrage and anger, and those demonstrations spread globally. And it led to a swift push for action from many lawmakers who rarely agree on much of anything.
“There are thousands of people marching in the streets, demanding meaningful change. People are demanding action,” said Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. “We've seen enough. We've had enough commissions. We have studied these issues. We have convened opinion leaders. We have talked about these in private conversations and in public conversations. Now is time to act.”
Few changes of heart have come so quickly, especially in the highly polarized era in Washington. Lawmakers are pushing for legislation to change police procedures, President Donald Trump signed an executive order, and both sides are claiming the mantle of police reform.
Public opinion has shifted. About half of American adults now say police violence against the public is a “very” or “extremely” serious problem, up from about a third as recently as September last year, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Only about 3 in 10 said the same in July 2015.
“Is policing in America a systematically racist enterprise? I’d like to think not,” Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Tuesday. “Because I do believe most cops are far more good than bad. But when every black man in America believes that getting stopped by the cops is a traumatic experience, something happened.”
Graham talked about how he's rarely pulled over by police and when he is, “there is literally no fear.”
""I wouldn't like to live in a country where I'd be afraid to be stopped,"" Graham said.
Police reform has gone from an issue that fractured Congress to one where both parties speak in unison about the need for action. Both the Democrats and Republicans have unveiled bills meant to bring major changes in how officers interact with communities, including accountability for misconduct and training on how to de-escalate tense situations. While Democrats have pushed for reforms before, the dueling bills both push core changes that would have been unheard of a few years ago.
Trump's executive order establishes a database that tracks police officers with excessive use-of-force complaints in their records. Many officers who wind up involved in fatal interactions have long complaint histories, including Derek Chauvin, the white Minneapolis police officer charged with murder in Floyd’s death. Those records are often not made public, making it difficult to know if an officer has such a history.
The executive order gives police departments a financial incentive to adopt best practices and encourage co-responder programs, in which social workers join police when they respond to nonviolent calls involving mental health, addiction and homelessness issues.
That idea has been percolating in communities of color and among activists for decades. And the proposed changes, banning chokeholds, for example, have already been made in many police departments. Some cities have pushed for de-escalation tactics, and others, like Camden, New Jersey, have dismantled departments and started over.
So there is little new in the case of Floyd, though something about it was so visceral and vivid that it could not be ignored. It pushed law enforcement leaders nationwide to speak out publicly when they have kept silent before, and it has forced lawmakers into introspection.
It also resurfaced other stories, from professional and working-class black men, of routine mistreatment at the hands of police. Even Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., has talked about his experiences as a black man being stopped in the U.S. Capitol.
And then there are the deaths. Some aren't caught on video, like Ramarley Graham in New York City, who was shot to death in his own bathroom in 2012, not far from his little brother and grandmother. Or Freddie Gray in Baltimore, who died in the back of a police car.
But some are captured on camera: Philando Castile's death in Minneapolis on livestream in 2016. Eric Garner in New York. Laquan McDonald in Chicago.
And 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Cleveland, playing with a toy gun, was shot to death by a police officer in 2014.
These, too, have prompted protests. They gave birth to the Black Lives Matter movement. The Obama administration created a task force on police reform, and the Justice Department opened up nearly two dozen civil rights investigations into policing.
But there was a fractured Congress and lack of overwhelming public support. In 2012, Illinois Rep. Bobby Rush was removed from the House floor after he wore a hoodie while calling for an investigation into the shooting of Trayvon Martin.
Congress in 2015 and 2016 was instead focused on the Blue Lives Matter act, which would have made an attack on a police officer a hate crime. More than a dozen states passed similar laws after a spate of police killings.
Then came the 2016 presidential election of Trump, and political and racial divisions became more fraught. Police reform was a decidedly lower Washington priority.
Until Floyd uttered the same words Eric Garner did before he died: “I can't breathe.”
However late, police reform academics and activists are heartened by the push and the sudden coalescing around the issue.
“I am cautiously optimistic,"" said Durham, N.C. Police Chief Cerelyn Davis, the president of the National Order of Black Law Enforcement Executives. ""That the cries of our America will be heard and acted upon so that once and for all black lives are valued in the eyes of the police, as more than a counterfeit 20-dollar bill, more than a carton of cigarettes, and more important than simply showing up at the wrong address.”

The Post and Courier on remembering the nine African American parishioners at Charleston’s Emanuel AME Church who were massacred by a white supremacist:
Most of us remember where we were and what we were doing on the evening of June 17, 2015, when nine African American parishioners at Charleston’s Emanuel AME Church were gunned down during a Bible study.
As the fifth anniversary arrives, it doesn’t feel like enough simply to remember that horrible crime, especially as a fresh wave of racial tension breaks over this country.
The latest unrest has been triggered by last month’s death of George Floyd at the hands of a white Minneapolis police officer. To many protesters, his death is part of a larger pattern, one that includes too many widely reported, hate-driven deaths of African Americans, including those killed by a white supremacist inside Emanuel.
So we need to remember more than that tragic day and those lives lost and irrevocably changed. We need to remember the goal of the pathetic criminal — to start a race war — and to rededicate ourselves to empathy, understanding and goodwill. We need to rededicate ourselves to fighting hate.
It is heartening to see so many survivors and relatives doing just that, in their own way.
As The Post and Courier’s Jennifer Berry Hawes reports, Tyrone and Felicia Sanders, who lost their son Tywanza, 26, find hope in his namesake foundation, which awards college scholarships and supports a camp for entrepreneurs. Jennifer Pinckney, widow of Pastor Clementa Pinckney, has focused on their daughters. The Rev. Anthony Thompson, who lost his wife, Myra, wrote a book, “Called to Forgive.” The Rev. Sharon Risher and Chris Singleton also have written books.
Rev. Thompson also speaks together often with survivor Polly Sheppard to spread the message about the power of faith. “That’s where I’m at now when it comes to remembering, it’s about helping people,” he told Ms. Hawes.
Those stories are just a slice of how they are picking up the pieces and trying to turn an unimaginable loss into something good, or at least not as bad.
Most of us did not have a family member inside Emanuel that evening, but we all share a sense of loss and grief. And on this anniversary, we all can do something in our own way to try to improve things, whether it’s forging new relationships, becoming more politically active or providing fresh support for a good cause.
There is hope that something good will come out of all this nation’s anguish over the death of Mr. Floyd and other tragedies, including the one that unfolded in downtown Charleston five years ago.
U.S. House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn told our Jamie Lovegrove essentially what so many others have said in recent weeks: This time feels different.
“I spend quite a bit of time researching and reflecting upon our country’s history, and I cannot think of any other time that this kind of reexamination has taken place,” Mr. Clyburn said.
This may indeed be a unique opportunity to make progress on matters of justice and equity — to help build a better America. In doing so, we should draw inspiration from the living victims of the Emanuel tragedy and the example they continue to set of empathy, love and hope.

The Los Angles Times on two black men found dead, hanging from trees:
The image of a Black man hanging from a tree is seared into the American psyche as the embodiment of racism in all its ugliness and cruelty. Lynchings of African Americans through the civil rights era of the 1960s challenged the nation’s perception of itself as the land of liberty, justice, equality and rule of law, and we have seen to our horror that even today, racial hatred can still descend to murder.
So even if a hanging in the Antelope Valley might look at the authorities’ first glance like suicide, that simply must not be the end of it. There must be a thorough probe, and findings must be made public.
The body of 24-year-old Robert Fuller was found June 10 in a tree near Palmdale City Hall. Officials quickly labeled it a suicide, but protesters to their credit immediately demanded a deeper investigation. So did Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger.
How likely is it that a man would hang himself from a tree? It is not unheard of, but it is hardly reassuring to note that two weeks earlier the body of 38-year-old Malcolm Harsch was found hanging from a tree in Victorville, a desert city at the opposite end of the storied Pearblossom Highway from Palmdale. Coincidence is possible. But so is a pattern. We don’t have enough information yet to know. Until a generation ago, much of the desert just north of Los Angeles and San Bernardino was dotted with mostly white communities that attracted families seeking homes that were more affordable and a lifestyle that was less urban than what was found in the packed cities south of the mountains. They were joined in the 1980s by a large migration from L.A. of Black families. The relatively quick demographic change brought some tension and several instances of violence.
L.A. County Dist. Atty. Jackie Lacey is today vocally opposed by protesters angry that she has not prosecuted police who have killed unarmed Black men. But as a young deputy district attorney assigned to Lancaster (not far from Palmdale), she prosecuted the killers of a homeless man whom they had met at a McDonald’s. Lacey said that they had set out to kill a Black man and that, when they had done it, they celebrated by getting tattoos. Lacey won the county’s first hate crime convictions.
“Here we are in the 1990s, in Southern California,” she recounted as a candidate in 2012, “and you have a racist group that has decided to murder people much the way they did in the South and got away with it in the ’50s. The verdict was about this: We are not going back there. Justice will be served. It was a message to anyone else out there who would even think of engaging in this behavior — that we’re just not going back there.”
That’s a sentiment that ought to ring true today: We will not go back there. Those are the words that ought to be on our minds when we see the videotaped killing of Ahmaud Arbery, who was chased down this year by white men in Georgia and shot to death. We will not go back there — and yet here we are. Arbery’s killing has the look and feel of a lynching, even if in this instance there was no rope and no tree.
That was the South, but those same words echo when we see the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. And yes, Floyd was killed not by a lynch mob but by a police officer. Yet the brutality and gratuitousness of the killing lend it the caustic flavor of a lynching. We will not go back there, yet here we are.
People around the nation are marching in resolve and anger against the continuing individual and institutional — and deadly — anti-Black racism still ingrained in our society. We struggle with the lines that separate the killing of people like Breonna Taylor in her own home by police officers from the killing of people like Arbery by civilians.
So we do not — we must not — simply shrug and say “suicide” when Black men are found hanging in trees. We leave no stone unturned until we can determine conclusively that these men were not killed by others, but by themselves.
And then, if we conclude that it could not have been murder but must have been suicide, we must recognize that our work is not done. We will have to ask ourselves: Why would a young Black man in the 21st century United States kill himself? Suicide in the Black community was historically low but is on the rise, especially among teenagers and young adults. Where did we go wrong? And, whether it be murder or suicide, how do we prevent such a thing from happening again?

Valdosta Daily Times on commemorating Juneteenth:
On Jan. 1, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, announcing all persons held as slaves within the rebellious areas are and henceforth shall be free.
A political move by Lincoln, the proclamation did not end slavery immediately or in all states, but it served as a rallying cry for Union troops and for blacks to fight on the side of the Union to win their freedom.
The Civil War did not officially end until June 2, 1865, and word of the Emancipation Proclamation did not reach the last stronghold of slavery, in Galveston, Texas, until June 19, 1865, more than two and a half years after it was issued.
“The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a Proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and free laborer.”
So began General Order Number 3, as read by Major Gen. Gordon Granger on June 19, 1865.
It was on this date that Union soldiers landed at Galveston, Texas, with news the Civil War had ended and the enslaved were now free — again, two and a half years after President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation, which became official Jan. 1, 1863.
The annual celebration of the events of June 19, 1865, is most commonly known as Juneteenth. It’s the oldest known celebration commemorating the ending of slavery in the United States. ...
Juneteenth has become a day of freedom — a day marking the liberation from American slavery, and now a day symbolically marking the liberation from racism and prejudice.

The Guardian on journalist Maria Ressa being found guilty of “cyber libel” in the Philippines:
The persecution of the courageous journalist Maria Ressa in the Philippines should not only horrify her compatriots and her counterparts elsewhere. The conviction of Ms Ressa and a former colleague for cyberlibel this week, which could see them serve up to six years in prison, is designed to chill the media. But it should reverberate throughout her nation and more widely, because it forms part of a broader assault on democracy.
Having overthrown dictatorship three decades ago, the Philippines is now regressing under its authoritarian but popular president, Rodrigo Duterte. His brutal “war on drugs,” with its thousands of extrajudicial killings, has been accompanied by a relentless campaign against those who have dared to challenge it or otherwise criticise him.
As president-elect, Mr Duterte suggested that corrupt journalists were “not exempted” from assassination and told reporters: “You won’t be killed if you don’t do anything wrong.” The leading broadcaster ABS-CBN was forced off air last month when its licence was not renewed.
Rappler, the news website headed by Ms Ressa, has already faced verbal attacks by Mr Duterte, multiple investigations, tax fraud charges and the revocation of its licence. Amnesty has described this week’s verdict as a sham. The Philippines has signed treaties that outlaw jailing people for libel. The article, which alleged ties between a businessman and a high court judge, was not authored by Ms Ressa herself. It appeared years before the legislation on cyberlibel had been passed. Yet the court accepted that Rappler had “republished” it because a single spelling mistake was corrected. Ms Ressa is now appealing.
This is, as she has said, an existential moment for journalism and for democracy. The country’s legislature has just passed a draconian anti-terrorism bill allowing the surveillance, warrantless arrest and detention of “suspicious” individuals. Human rights defenders say it will give authorities carte blanche to target those who criticise them online. ....
Under another president, the US would strongly press Manila over Ms Ressa’s case. But Donald Trump loves authoritarians and has normalised and enabled the abuses of press freedom that are now increasing worldwide. As his administration stands by, making only the most feeble statement, others must take a stand. While the UK has rightly expressed concern about the case, it should now work with others to defend media freedom.
It is not merely that Ms Ressa and her colleagues need and deserve support: her case has such frightening implications beyond her own country. When Mr Duterte is given a free pass for his behaviour, other leaders take note. Without freedom of the media, it is impossible to protect other freedoms: citizens cannot know what is being done in their name. Journalists are targeted because they sound the alarm. They must not be silenced.

The New York Times on a Supreme Court ruling barring employers from firing workers for being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender:
In an emphatic win for civil rights, equal justice and common sense, the Supreme Court ruled on Monday that federal law bars employers from firing workers for being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.
The vote was 6 to 3. It should have been unanimous.
As Justice Neil Gorsuch explained for the court’s majority, the right result could not be clearer. The federal law at issue, Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, prohibits employment discrimination “because of sex.” And “an employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex,” Justice Gorsuch wrote. “Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids.”
In separate cases consolidated for argument, three plaintiffs — two gay men and a transgender woman — had sued their employers for firing them after learning of their sexual orientation or transgender status.
It does not matter, the court said, whether the employer might have had additional reasons for the firing. “Intentionally burning down a neighbor’s house is arson, even if the perpetrator’s ultimate intention (or motivation) is only to improve the view,” Justice Gorsuch wrote.
Nor can an employer avoid the law’s prohibition by claiming it treats all men the same or all women the same. The bottom line, he wrote, is that Congress wrote a law with intentionally broad language, and “ours is a society of written laws.”
Monday’s decision will soon have ripple effects, including the likely invalidation of the Trump administration’s decision last week to eliminate protections against discrimination in health care for transgender patients.
In a lengthy dissent that sounded like it was written in 1964, Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, argued that the court’s job is to interpret statutes to “mean what they conveyed to reasonable people at the time they were written.” It’s hard to imagine these justices applying the same logic to the meaning of the Second Amendment, which reasonable people at the time understood to apply to bayonets and muskets. But we digress.
Justice Alito’s point was that the lawmakers who passed the Civil Rights Act could not possibly have anticipated “sex” to cover discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.
That’s true, of course. They also could not have imagined that it would cover sexual harassment of male employees — and yet in 1998 the Supreme Court found unanimously that it did. “Statutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably comparable evils, and it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed,” the court said then, in an opinion written by Justice Antonin Scalia.
Justice Gorsuch, who succeeded Justice Scalia on the bench, reiterated this basic concept on Monday: “The limits of the drafters’ imagination supply no reason to ignore the law’s demands. When the express terms of a statute give us one answer and extratextual considerations suggest another, it’s no contest. Only the written word is the law, and all persons are entitled to its benefit.”
While we’re on the subject of legislators’ intentions, it is worth noting the historical irony behind the inclusion of “sex” in the civil rights law — which was, after all, targeted primarily at racial discrimination. The term was added at the last minute by Representative Howard Smith, a staunch segregationist from Virginia, in the hope that lawmakers would see it as a bridge too far and vote down the entire bill. Mr. Smith’s failed gambit continues to pay off in ways that he surely never could have dreamed.
Still, there are reasons to be cautious.
Justice Gorsuch’s commitment to textualism, a method of interpreting laws by looking solely to their plain words, achieved a just result in this case, but when applied too rigidly it can lead to very unjust results. In his previous job on a federal appeals court, then-Judge Gorsuch wrote an opinion holding that a trucker could legally be fired for abandoning his broken-down truck in subzero temperatures — based on a wooden reading of the word “operate.” In short, this particular victory for gay rights was based not on the fundamental equality or dignity of gay and transgender Americans, as previous Supreme Court decisions have been; it was based on the meaning of a single word.
The opinion also hints at a potentially serious obstacle on the horizon: claims by employers that being prohibited from discriminating against gay and transgender workers violates their religious convictions. Such claims are likely to find a sympathetic ear among this Supreme Court’s conservative majority, which has repeatedly voted to protect if not promote religion and religious objectors.
For now, however, Monday’s decision is a victory to savor, the next major step in a line of gay rights decisions stretching back nearly a quarter century, and until now written solely by Justice Anthony Kennedy.
Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who succeeded Justice Kennedy in 2018, graciously admitted as much in his own dissent. Although he disagreed with the majority’s opinion, he wrote: “It is appropriate to acknowledge the important victory achieved today by gay and lesbian Americans. Millions of gay and lesbian Americans have worked hard for many decades to achieve equal treatment in fact and in law. They have exhibited extraordinary vision, tenacity and grit — battling often steep odds in the legislative and judicial arenas, not to mention in their daily lives. They have advanced powerful policy arguments and can take pride in today’s result.”
Take pride, indeed.

The Wall Street Journal on a possible second wave of COVID-19 cases:
Stocks sold off Thursday amid investor worries that a “second wave” of coronavirus infections could cause countries and states that are reopening to lock down again. But headlines about a coronavirus resurgence in the U.S. are overblown so far, and the bigger threat is keeping the economy in a coma.
“We know as a fact that reopening other states we’re seeing significant problems,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday. “Twelve states that reopened are now seeing spikes. This is a very real possibility.” This is Mr. Cuomo’s excuse for keeping New York City in lockdown purgatory for 12 weeks as other states reopen and their economies rebound.
Democrats cite a spike in cases in Florida, Arizona and Texas as evidence of a virus resurgence. But more testing, especially in vulnerable communities, is naturally turning up more cases. Cases in Texas have increased by about a third in the last two weeks, but so have tests. About a quarter of the new cases are in counties with large prisons and meatpacking plants that were never forced to shut down.
Tests have increased by about 37% in Florida in two weeks, but confirmed cases have risen 28%. ... In Arizona, cases have increased by 73% in the last two weeks though tests have increased by just 53%. But a quarter of all cases in the state are on Indian reservations, which have especially high-risk populations. ...
Liberals and the media demanded more testing before states could reopen, yet now are criticizing states because more testing has turned up more cases. Keep in mind that New York has reported about the same number of new cases in the last two weeks as Florida, though it ramped up testing earlier so the relative increase appears less significant.
A more important metric is hospitalizations. In Arizona the weekly rolling average for new Covid-19 hospitalizations has been flat for a month. Emergency-room visits for Covid-19 have spiked this week, but the number of ER beds in use hasn’t changed since late April. ...
Texas has also recently reported an uptick in Covid-19 hospitalizations, mostly in the Houston and Austin areas. Current Covid-19 hospitalizations are up about 20% since the state began to reopen, but Gov. Greg Abbott says hospitals aren’t overwhelmed and much of the increase is tied to nursing homes. ....
Fatalities are a lagging epidemic indicator since most people who die have been in the hospital for two to three weeks. But deaths also aren’t surging. Texas has recorded 151 deaths this past week versus 221 in the last week of April. Florida has reported 239 deaths, 72 fewer than in the last week of April.
Deaths are probably declining in part from better and earlier treatment, but this means there’s less to fear from reopening. While Arizona has reported 114 deaths—43 more than in the last week of April—its deaths per capita are similar to the 325 that New York has reported in the past week.
Mr. Cuomo over the weekend boasted that New York “did the impossible” and “crushed” the coronavirus curve. New York has made enormous progress since the early days of the pandemic, which hit the state harder and earlier because of its population density, mass transit and international travel. We aren’t among the revisionists who say Mr. Cuomo should have locked down New York earlier.
But other states that didn’t impose strict lockdowns and have been gradually reopening have kept the epidemic under control and not paid as high an economic price. Some 7.3% of workers in Arizona and Florida and 11.4% in Texas were collecting unemployment benefits in late May compared to 18.7% in New York.
More infections are inevitable as states reopen, and there will be much trial and error. States need to be vigilant for outbreaks and protect high-risk areas and the vulnerable. But the costs of shutting down the economy are so great, in damage to lives and livelihoods, that there is no alternative to opening for the broader public good.

On Jan. 1, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, announcing all persons held as slaves within the rebellious areas are and henceforth shall be free.
A political move by Lincoln, the proclamation did not end slavery immediately or in all states, but it served as a rallying cry for Union troops and for blacks to fight on the side of the Union to win their freedom.
The Civil War did not officially end until June 2, 1865, and word of the Emancipation Proclamation did not reach the last stronghold of slavery, in Galveston, Texas, until June 19, 1865, more than two and a half years after it was issued.

Juneteenth has become a day of freedom - a day marking the liberation from American slavery, and now a day symbolically marking the liberation from racism and prejudice.

The Guardian on journalist Maria Ressa being found guilty of ""cyber libel"" in the Philippines:
The persecution of the courageous journalist Maria Ressa in the Philippines should not only horrify her compatriots and her counterparts elsewhere. The conviction of Ms Ressa and a former colleague for cyberlibel this week, which could see them serve up to six years in prison, is designed to chill the media. But it should reverberate throughout her nation and more widely, because it forms part of a broader assault on democracy.
Having overthrown dictatorship three decades ago, the Philippines is now regressing under its authoritarian but popular president, Rodrigo Duterte. His brutal ""war on drugs,"" with its thousands of extrajudicial killings, has been accompanied by a relentless campaign against those who have dared to challenge it or otherwise criticise him.
As president-elect, Mr Duterte suggested that corrupt journalists were ""not exempted"" from assassination and told reporters: ""You won't be killed if you don't do anything wrong."" The leading broadcaster ABS-CBN was forced off air last month when its licence was not renewed.
Rappler, the news website headed by Ms Ressa, has already faced verbal attacks by Mr Duterte, multiple investigations, tax fraud charges and the revocation of its licence. Amnesty has described this week's verdict as a sham. The Philippines has signed treaties that outlaw jailing people for libel. The article, which alleged ties between a businessman and a high court judge, was not authored by Ms Ressa herself. It appeared years before the legislation on cyberlibel had been passed. Yet the court accepted that Rappler had ""republished"" it because a single spelling mistake was corrected. Ms Ressa is now appealing.
This is, as she has said, an existential moment for journalism and for democracy. The country's legislature has just passed a draconian anti-terrorism bill allowing the surveillance, warrantless arrest and detention of ""suspicious"" individuals. Human rights defenders say it will give authorities carte blanche to target those who criticise them online. ....
Under another president, the US would strongly press Manila over Ms Ressa's case. But Donald Trump loves authoritarians and has normalised and enabled the abuses of press freedom that are now increasing worldwide. As his administration stands by, making only the most feeble statement, others must take a stand. While the UK has rightly expressed concern about the case, it should now work with others to defend media freedom.
It is not merely that Ms Ressa and her colleagues need and deserve support: her case has such frightening implications beyond her own country. When Mr Duterte is given a free pass for his behaviour, other leaders take note. Without freedom of the media, it is impossible to protect other freedoms: citizens cannot know what is being done in their name. Journalists are targeted because they sound the alarm. They must not be silenced.

The New York Times on a Supreme Court ruling barring employers from firing workers for being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender:
In an emphatic win for civil rights, equal justice and common sense, the Supreme Court ruled on Monday that federal law bars employers from firing workers for being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.
The vote was 6 to 3. It should have been unanimous.
As Justice Neil Gorsuch explained for the court's majority, the right result could not be clearer. The federal law at issue, Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, prohibits employment discrimination ""because of sex."" And ""an employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex,"" Justice Gorsuch wrote. ""Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids.""
In separate cases consolidated for argument, three plaintiffs - two gay men and a transgender woman - had sued their employers for firing them after learning of their sexual orientation or transgender status.
It does not matter, the court said, whether the employer might have had additional reasons for the firing. ""Intentionally burning down a neighbour's house is arson, even if the perpetrator's ultimate intention (or motivation) is only to improve the view,"" Justice Gorsuch wrote.
Nor can an employer avoid the law's prohibition by claiming it treats all men the same or all women the same. The bottom line, he wrote, is that Congress wrote a law with intentionally broad language, and ""ours is a society of written laws.""
Monday's decision will soon have ripple effects, including the likely invalidation of the Trump administration's decision last week to eliminate protections against discrimination in health care for transgender patients.
In a lengthy dissent that sounded like it was written in 1964, Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, argued that the court's job is to interpret statutes to ""mean what they conveyed to reasonable people at the time they were written."" It's hard to imagine these justices applying the same logic to the meaning of the Second Amendment, which reasonable people at the time understood to apply to bayonets and muskets. But we digress.
Justice Alito's point was that the lawmakers who passed the Civil Rights Act could not possibly have anticipated ""sex"" to cover discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.
That's true, of course. They also could not have imagined that it would cover sexual harassment of male employees - and yet in 1998 the Supreme Court found unanimously that it did. ""Statutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably comparable evils, and it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed,"" the court said then, in an opinion written by Justice Antonin Scalia.
Justice Gorsuch, who succeeded Justice Scalia on the bench, reiterated this basic concept on Monday: ""The limits of the drafters' imagination supply no reason to ignore the law's demands. When the express terms of a statute give us one answer and extratextual considerations suggest another, it's no contest. Only the written word is the law, and all persons are entitled to its benefit.""
While we're on the subject of legislators' intentions, it is worth noting the historical irony behind the inclusion of ""sex"" in the civil rights law - which was, after all, targeted primarily at racial discrimination. The term was added at the last minute by Representative Howard Smith, a staunch segregationist from Virginia, in the hope that lawmakers would see it as a bridge too far and vote down the entire bill. Mr. Smith's failed gambit continues to pay off in ways that he surely never could have dreamed.
Still, there are reasons to be cautious.
Justice Gorsuch's commitment to textualism, a method of interpreting laws by looking solely to their plain words, achieved a just result in this case, but when applied too rigidly it can lead to very unjust results. In his previous job on a federal appeals court, then-Judge Gorsuch wrote an opinion holding that a trucker could legally be fired for abandoning his broken-down truck in subzero temperatures - based on a wooden reading of the word ""operate."" In short, this particular victory for gay rights was based not on the fundamental equality or dignity of gay and transgender Americans, as previous Supreme Court decisions have been; it was based on the meaning of a single word.
The opinion also hints at a potentially serious obstacle on the horizon: claims by employers that being prohibited from discriminating against gay and transgender workers violates their religious convictions. Such claims are likely to find a sympathetic ear among this Supreme Court's conservative majority, which has repeatedly voted to protect if not promote religion and religious objectors.
For now, however, Monday's decision is a victory to savour, the next major step in a line of gay rights decisions stretching back nearly a quarter century, and until now written solely by Justice Anthony Kennedy.
Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who succeeded Justice Kennedy in 2018, graciously admitted as much in his own dissent. Although he disagreed with the majority's opinion, he wrote: ""It is appropriate to acknowledge the important victory achieved today by gay and lesbian Americans. Millions of gay and lesbian Americans have worked hard for many decades to achieve equal treatment in fact and in law. They have exhibited extraordinary vision, tenacity and grit - battling often steep odds in the legislative and judicial arenas, not to mention in their daily lives. They have advanced powerful policy arguments and can take pride in today's result.""
Take pride, indeed.

The Wall Street Journal on a possible second wave of COVID-19 cases:
Stocks sold off Thursday amid investor worries that a ""second wave"" of coronavirus infections could cause countries and states that are reopening to lock down again. But headlines about a coronavirus resurgence in the U.S. are overblown so far, and the bigger threat is keeping the economy in a coma.
""We know as a fact that reopening other states we're seeing significant problems,"" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday. ""Twelve states that reopened are now seeing spikes. This is a very real possibility."" This is Mr. Cuomo's excuse for keeping New York City in lockdown purgatory for 12 weeks as other states reopen and their economies rebound.
Democrats cite a spike in cases in Florida, Arizona and Texas as evidence of a virus resurgence. But more testing, especially in vulnerable communities, is naturally turning up more cases. Cases in Texas have increased by about a third in the last two weeks, but so have tests. About a quarter of the new cases are in counties with large prisons and meatpacking plants that were never forced to shut down.
Tests have increased by about 37% in Florida in two weeks, but confirmed cases have risen 28%. ... In Arizona, cases have increased by 73% in the last two weeks though tests have increased by just 53%. But a quarter of all cases in the state are on Indian reservations, which have especially high-risk populations. ...
Liberals and the media demanded more testing before states could reopen, yet now are criticizing states because more testing has turned up more cases. Keep in mind that New York has reported about the same number of new cases in the last two weeks as Florida, though it ramped up testing earlier so the relative increase appears less significant.
A more important metric is hospitalizations. In Arizona the weekly rolling average for new Covid-19 hospitalizations has been flat for a month. Emergency-room visits for Covid-19 have spiked this week, but the number of ER beds in use hasn't changed since late April. ...
Texas has also recently reported an uptick in Covid-19 hospitalizations, mostly in the Houston and Austin areas. Current Covid-19 hospitalizations are up about 20% since the state began to reopen, but Gov. Greg Abbott says hospitals aren't overwhelmed and much of the increase is tied to nursing homes. ....
Fatalities are a lagging epidemic indicator since most people who die have been in the hospital for two to three weeks. But deaths also aren't surging. Texas has recorded 151 deaths this past week versus 221 in the last week of April. Florida has reported 239 deaths, 72 fewer than in the last week of April.
Deaths are probably declining in part from better and earlier treatment, but this means there's less to fear from reopening. While Arizona has reported 114 deaths-43 more than in the last week of April-its deaths per capita are similar to the 325 that New York has reported in the past week.
Mr. Cuomo over the weekend boasted that New York ""did the impossible"" and ""crushed"" the coronavirus curve. New York has made enormous progress since the early days of the pandemic, which hit the state harder and earlier because of its population density, mass transit and international travel. We aren't among the revisionists who say Mr. Cuomo should have locked down New York earlier.
But other states that didn't impose strict lockdowns and have been gradually reopening have kept the epidemic under control and not paid as high an economic price. Some 7.3% of workers in Arizona and Florida and 11.4% in Texas were collecting unemployment benefits in late May compared to 18.7% in New York.
More infections are inevitable as states reopen, and there will be much trial and error. States need to be vigilant for outbreaks and protect high-risk areas and the vulnerable. But the costs of shutting down the economy are so great, in damage to lives and livelihoods, that there is no alternative to opening for the broader public good.

84,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1001/Files (250).DOCX","Associated Press International",2020-06-18,"1046 words","POLITICAL NEWS","COLLEEN LONG, Associated Press",NA,"Analysis: Floyd death, protests show need for police reform",FALSE,"WASHINGTON (AP) — It looks like Washington has finally woken up.
The death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and the nationwide demonstrations that followed have roused once reluctant lawmakers and even a president who preaches law and order to push now for police reforms.
The way Floyd, who was black, was pressed prone into the street, the way the white officer stared at the bystander's camera as he dug his knee into Floyd's neck while the man cried for his mother, for air, for his life, made for a moment that could not be ignored.
It drew together people of all races who poured into America's streets to express outrage and anger, and those demonstrations spread globally. And it led to a swift push for action from many lawmakers who rarely agree on anything.
“There are thousands of people marching in the streets, demanding meaningful change. People are demanding action,” said Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. “We've seen enough. We've had enough commissions. We have studied these issues. We have convened opinion leaders. We have talked about these in private conversations and in public conversations. Now is time to act.”
Few changes of heart have come so quickly, especially in this highly polarized era in Washington. Lawmakers are pushing for legislation to change police procedures, President Donald Trump signed an executive order, and both sides are claiming the mantle of police reform.
Public opinion has shifted. About half of American adults now say police violence against the public is a “very” or “extremely” serious problem, up from about a third as recently as September 2019, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.
“Is policing in America a systematically racist enterprise? I’d like to think not,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Tuesday. “Because I do believe most cops are far more good than bad. But when every black man in America believes that getting stopped by the cops is a traumatic experience, something happened.”
Graham talked about how he's rarely pulled over by police and when he is, “there is literally no fear.”
""I wouldn't like to live in a country where I'd be afraid to be stopped,"" Graham said.
Police reform has gone from an issue that fractured Congress to one where both parties speak in unison about the need for action. Both Democrats and Republicans have unveiled bills meant to bring major changes in how officers interact with communities, including accountability for misconduct and training on how to de-escalate tense situations. While Democrats have pushed for reforms before, the dueling bills seek core changes that would have been unheard of a few years ago.
Trump's executive order establishes a database that tracks police officers with excessive use-of-force complaints in their records. Many officers involved in fatal interactions have long complaint histories, including Derek Chauvin, the white Minneapolis police officer charged with murder in Floyd’s death. Those records are often not made public.
The executive order gives police departments a financial incentive to adopt best practices and encourage co-responder programs, in which social workers join police when they respond to nonviolent calls involving mental health, addiction and homelessness issues.
That idea has been percolating in communities of color and among activists for decades. And the proposed changes, banning chokeholds, for example, have already been made in many police departments. Some cities have pushed for de-escalation tactics, and others, like Camden, New Jersey, have dismantled departments and started over.
But there was something so visceral in the case of Floyd that it could not be ignored. It pushed law enforcement leaders nationwide to speak out publicly when they have kept silent before, and it forced lawmakers into introspection.
It also resurfaced other stories, from professional and working-class black men, of routine mistreatment at the hands of police. Even Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., talked about his experiences as a black man being stopped in the U.S. Capitol.
And then there are the deaths. Some aren't caught on video, like Ramarley Graham's in New York City. He was shot to death in his bathroom in 2012, not far from his little brother and grandmother. Or Freddie Gray's in Baltimore. He died in the back of a police van.
But some are captured on camera: Philando Castile's death in Minneapolis on livestream in 2016. Eric Garner's in New York. Laquan McDonald's in Chicago.
And 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Cleveland, playing with a toy gun, was shot to death by a police officer in 2014.
These, too, have prompted protests. They gave birth to the Black Lives Matter movement. The Obama administration created a task force on police reform, and the Justice Department opened up nearly two dozen civil rights investigations into policing.
But there was a fractured Congress and lack of overwhelming public support. In 2012, Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., was removed from the House floor after he wore a hoodie while calling for an investigation into the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.
Congress in 2015 and 2016 was instead focused on the Blue Lives Matter act, which would have made an attack on a police officer a hate crime. More than a dozen states passed similar laws after a spate of police killings. Congress passed a version of the law last year.
Then came Trump's election, and political and racial divisions became more fraught. Police reform was a decidedly lower Washington priority.
Until Floyd uttered the same words Garner did before he died: “I can't breathe.”
However late, police reform academics and activists are heartened by the push and the sudden coalescing around the issue.
“I am cautiously optimistic,"" said Durham, North Carolina, Police Chief Cerelyn Davis, the president of the National Order of Black Law Enforcement Executives. ""That the cries of our America will be heard and acted upon so that once and for all black lives are valued in the eyes of the police, as more than a counterfeit 20-dollar bill, more than a carton of cigarettes, and more important than simply showing up at the wrong address.”

The Post and Courier on remembering the nine African American parishioners at Charleston's Emanuel AME Church who were massacred by a white supremacist:
Most of us remember where we were and what we were doing on the evening of June 17, 2015, when nine African American parishioners at Charleston's Emanuel AME Church were gunned down during a Bible study.
As the fifth anniversary arrives, it doesn't feel like enough simply to remember that horrible crime, especially as a fresh wave of racial tension breaks over this country.
The latest unrest has been triggered by last month's death of George Floyd at the hands of a white Minneapolis police officer. To many protesters, his death is part of a larger pattern, one that includes too many widely reported, hate-driven deaths of African Americans, including those killed by a white supremacist inside Emanuel.
So we need to remember more than that tragic day and those lives lost and irrevocably changed. We need to remember the goal of the pathetic criminal - to start a race war - and to rededicate ourselves to empathy, understanding and goodwill. We need to rededicate ourselves to fighting hate.
It is heartening to see so many survivors and relatives doing just that, in their own way.
As The Post and Courier's Jennifer Berry Hawes reports, Tyrone and Felicia Sanders, who lost their son Tywanza, 26, find hope in his namesake foundation, which awards college scholarships and supports a camp for entrepreneurs. Jennifer Pinckney, widow of Pastor Clementa Pinckney, has focused on their daughters. The Rev. Anthony Thompson, who lost his wife, Myra, wrote a book, ""Called to Forgive."" The Rev. Sharon Risher and Chris Singleton also have written books.
Rev. Thompson also speaks together often with survivor Polly Sheppard to spread the message about the power of faith. ""That's where I'm at now when it comes to remembering, it's about helping people,"" he told Ms. Hawes.
Those stories are just a slice of how they are picking up the pieces and trying to turn an unimaginable loss into something good, or at least not as bad.
Most of us did not have a family member inside Emanuel that evening, but we all share a sense of loss and grief. And on this anniversary, we all can do something in our own way to try to improve things, whether it's forging new relationships, becoming more politically active or providing fresh support for a good cause.
There is hope that something good will come out of all this nation's anguish over the death of Mr. Floyd and other tragedies, including the one that unfolded in downtown Charleston five years ago.
U.S. House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn told our Jamie Lovegrove essentially what so many others have said in recent weeks: This time feels different.
""I spend quite a bit of time researching and reflecting upon our country's history, and I cannot think of any other time that this kind of reexamination has taken place,"" Mr. Clyburn said.
This may indeed be a unique opportunity to make progress on matters of justice and equity - to help build a better America. In doing so, we should draw inspiration from the living victims of the Emanuel tragedy and the example they continue to set of empathy, love and hope.

The Los Angles Times on two black men found dead, hanging from trees:
The image of a Black man hanging from a tree is seared into the American psyche as the embodiment of racism in all its ugliness and cruelty. Lynchings of African Americans through the civil rights era of the 1960s challenged the nation's perception of itself as the land of liberty, justice, equality and rule of law, and we have seen to our horror that even today, racial hatred can still descend to murder.
So even if a hanging in the Antelope Valley might look at the authorities' first glance like suicide, that simply must not be the end of it. There must be a thorough probe, and findings must be made public.
The body of 24-year-old Robert Fuller was found June 10 in a tree near Palmdale City Hall. Officials quickly labeled it a suicide, but protesters to their credit immediately demanded a deeper investigation. So did Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger.
How likely is it that a man would hang himself from a tree? It is not unheard of, but it is hardly reassuring to note that two weeks earlier the body of 38-year-old Malcolm Harsch was found hanging from a tree in Victorville, a desert city at the opposite end of the storied Pearblossom Highway from Palmdale. Coincidence is possible. But so is a pattern. We don't have enough information yet to know. Until a generation ago, much of the desert just north of Los Angeles and San Bernardino was dotted with mostly white communities that attracted families seeking homes that were more affordable and a lifestyle that was less urban than what was found in the packed cities south of the mountains. They were joined in the 1980s by a large migration from L.A. of Black families. The relatively quick demographic change brought some tension and several instances of violence.
L.A. County Dist. Atty. Jackie Lacey is today vocally opposed by protesters angry that she has not prosecuted police who have killed unarmed Black men. But as a young deputy district attorney assigned to Lancaster (not far from Palmdale), she prosecuted the killers of a homeless man whom they had met at a McDonald's. Lacey said that they had set out to kill a Black man and that, when they had done it, they celebrated by getting tattoos. Lacey won the county's first hate crime convictions.
""Here we are in the 1990s, in Southern California,"" she recounted as a candidate in 2012, ""and you have a racist group that has decided to murder people much the way they did in the South and got away with it in the '50s. The verdict was about this: We are not going back there. Justice will be served. It was a message to anyone else out there who would even think of engaging in this behavior - that we're just not going back there.""
That's a sentiment that ought to ring true today: We will not go back there. Those are the words that ought to be on our minds when we see the videotaped killing of Ahmaud Arbery, who was chased down this year by white men in Georgia and shot to death. We will not go back there - and yet here we are. Arbery's killing has the look and feel of a lynching, even if in this instance there was no rope and no tree.
That was the South, but those same words echo when we see the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. And yes, Floyd was killed not by a lynch mob but by a police officer. Yet the brutality and gratuitousness of the killing lend it the caustic flavor of a lynching. We will not go back there, yet here we are.
People around the nation are marching in resolve and anger against the continuing individual and institutional - and deadly - anti-Black racism still ingrained in our society. We struggle with the lines that separate the killing of people like Breonna Taylor in her own home by police officers from the killing of people like Arbery by civilians.
So we do not - we must not - simply shrug and say ""suicide"" when Black men are found hanging in trees. We leave no stone unturned until we can determine conclusively that these men were not killed by others, but by themselves.
And then, if we conclude that it could not have been murder but must have been suicide, we must recognize that our work is not done. We will have to ask ourselves: Why would a young Black man in the 21st century United States kill himself? Suicide in the Black community was historically low but is on the rise, especially among teenagers and young adults. Where did we go wrong? And, whether it be murder or suicide, how do we prevent such a thing from happening again?

Valdosta Daily Times on commemorating Juneteenth:
On Jan. 1, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, announcing all persons held as slaves within the rebellious areas are and henceforth shall be free.
A political move by Lincoln, the proclamation did not end slavery immediately or in all states, but it served as a rallying cry for Union troops and for blacks to fight on the side of the Union to win their freedom.
The Civil War did not officially end until June 2, 1865, and word of the Emancipation Proclamation did not reach the last stronghold of slavery, in Galveston, Texas, until June 19, 1865, more than two and a half years after it was issued.
""The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a Proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and free laborer.""
So began General Order Number 3, as read by Major Gen. Gordon Granger on June 19, 1865.
It was on this date that Union soldiers landed at Galveston, Texas, with news the Civil War had ended and the enslaved were now free - again, two and a half years after President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, which became official Jan. 1, 1863.
The annual celebration of the events of June 19, 1865, is most commonly known as Juneteenth. It's the oldest known celebration commemorating the ending of slavery in the United States. ...
Juneteenth has become a day of freedom - a day marking the liberation from American slavery, and now a day symbolically marking the liberation from racism and prejudice.

Mr. Smith's failed gambit continues to pay off in ways that he surely never could have dreamed.
Still, there are reasons to be cautious.
Justice Gorsuch's commitment to textualism, a method of interpreting laws by looking solely to their plain words, achieved a just result in this case, but when applied too rigidly it can lead to very unjust results. In his previous job on a federal appeals court, then-Judge Gorsuch wrote an opinion holding that a trucker could legally be fired for abandoning his broken-down truck in subzero temperatures - based on a wooden reading of the word ""operate."" In short, this particular victory for gay rights was based not on the fundamental equality or dignity of gay and transgender Americans, as previous Supreme Court decisions have been; it was based on the meaning of a single word.
The opinion also hints at a potentially serious obstacle on the horizon: claims by employers that being prohibited from discriminating against gay and transgender workers violates their religious convictions. Such claims are likely to find a sympathetic ear among this Supreme Court's conservative majority, which has repeatedly voted to protect if not promote religion and religious objectors.
For now, however, Monday's decision is a victory to savor, the next major step in a line of gay rights decisions stretching back nearly a quarter century, and until now written solely by Justice Anthony Kennedy.
Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who succeeded Justice Kennedy in 2018, graciously admitted as much in his own dissent. Although he disagreed with the majority's opinion, he wrote: ""It is appropriate to acknowledge the important victory achieved today by gay and lesbian Americans. Millions of gay and lesbian Americans have worked hard for many decades to achieve equal treatment in fact and in law. They have exhibited extraordinary vision, tenacity and grit - battling often steep odds in the legislative and judicial arenas, not to mention in their daily lives. They have advanced powerful policy arguments and can take pride in today's result.""
Take pride, indeed.

The Wall Street Journal on a possible second wave of COVID-19 cases:
Stocks sold off Thursday amid investor worries that a ""second wave"" of coronavirus infections could cause countries and states that are reopening to lock down again. But headlines about a coronavirus resurgence in the U.S. are overblown so far, and the bigger threat is keeping the economy in a coma.
""We know as a fact that reopening other states we're seeing significant problems,"" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday. ""Twelve states that reopened are now seeing spikes. This is a very real possibility."" This is Mr. Cuomo's excuse for keeping New York City in lockdown purgatory for 12 weeks as other states reopen and their economies rebound.
Democrats cite a spike in cases in Florida, Arizona and Texas as evidence of a virus resurgence. But more testing, especially in vulnerable communities, is naturally turning up more cases. Cases in Texas have increased by about a third in the last two weeks, but so have tests. About a quarter of the new cases are in counties with large prisons and meatpacking plants that were never forced to shut down.
Tests have increased by about 37% in Florida in two weeks, but confirmed cases have risen 28%. ... In Arizona, cases have increased by 73% in the last two weeks though tests have increased by just 53%. But a quarter of all cases in the state are on Indian reservations, which have especially high-risk populations. ...
Liberals and the media demanded more testing before states could reopen, yet now are criticizing states because more testing has turned up more cases. Keep in mind that New York has reported about the same number of new cases in the last two weeks as Florida, though it ramped up testing earlier so the relative increase appears less significant.
A more important metric is hospitalizations. In Arizona the weekly rolling average for new Covid-19 hospitalizations has been flat for a month. Emergency-room visits for Covid-19 have spiked this week, but the number of ER beds in use hasn't changed since late April. ...
Texas has also recently reported an uptick in Covid-19 hospitalizations, mostly in the Houston and Austin areas. Current Covid-19 hospitalizations are up about 20% since the state began to reopen, but Gov. Greg Abbott says hospitals aren't overwhelmed and much of the increase is tied to nursing homes. ....
Fatalities are a lagging epidemic indicator since most people who die have been in the hospital for two to three weeks. But deaths also aren't surging. Texas has recorded 151 deaths this past week versus 221 in the last week of April. Florida has reported 239 deaths, 72 fewer than in the last week of April.
Deaths are probably declining in part from better and earlier treatment, but this means there's less to fear from reopening. While Arizona has reported 114 deaths-43 more than in the last week of April-its deaths per capita are similar to the 325 that New York has reported in the past week.
Mr. Cuomo over the weekend boasted that New York ""did the impossible"" and ""crushed"" the coronavirus curve. New York has made enormous progress since the early days of the pandemic, which hit the state harder and earlier because of its population density, mass transit and international travel. We aren't among the revisionists who say Mr. Cuomo should have locked down New York earlier.
But other states that didn't impose strict lockdowns and have been gradually reopening have kept the epidemic under control and not paid as high an economic price. Some 7.3% of workers in Arizona and Florida and 11.4% in Texas were collecting unemployment benefits in late May compared to 18.7% in New York.
More infections are inevitable as states reopen, and there will be much trial and error. States need to be vigilant for outbreaks and protect high-risk areas and the vulnerable. But the costs of shutting down the economy are so great, in damage to lives and livelihoods, that there is no alternative to opening for the broader public good.

Want to get The Morning by email? Here’s the sign-up.
Good morning. The vaccine news is good, but the short term will probably depend on state policies.
Whenever I visited my local coffee shop this summer, it did not allow any customers inside. I ordered a cup from a worker standing at a table blocking the front door and came back a few minutes later to pick it up.
In recent weeks, though, the shop’s setup has changed. I now walk inside and order. Often, there are a few other customers lingering nearby, waiting for their coffee.
Nationwide, there are many other versions of this story. Professional sports leagues, for example, weren’t allowing any fans in the stands for much of the summer. This weekend, thousands of people attended college and pro football games.
From a public-health perspective, these changes don’t make a whole lot of sense: Pandemic restrictions across the U.S. are now less stringent than they were in the summer even though the infection rate is much higher.
How did this happen? State and local governments loosened their policies as the virus receded in August and September — but then left those looser rules in place. (And the federal government has shown little leadership.)
Perhaps the No. 1 question about the pandemic in coming weeks is how aggressively state and local governments reinstate restrictions.
“With the level of community spread we have in Michigan and that many other states are now facing, the only way to bring Covid down is state action — or a terrible loss of life,” Robert Gordon, the director of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, told me yesterday.
Several states have announced new steps in the past few days. In Michigan, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced the temporary closing of indoor dining, casinos, movie theaters and in-person classes at high schools and colleges. Chicago, Philadelphia and most of California have also reimposed restrictions.
Most of the new restrictions have come from Democratic officials, like Whitmer, but this isn’t a simple partisan issue.
The Republican governors of Iowa and North Dakota have issued mask mandates over the past few days. And in The Wall Street Journal, the Republican health care experts Scott Gottlieb and Mark McClellan wrote an op-ed called “It’s Now Up to Governors to Slow the Spread.” Gottlieb and McClellan wrote: “At least while infections are widespread and surging, governors and local leaders should mandate the use of masks and impose clear and consistent plans to restrict gatherings.”
Still, most states, whether run by Democratic or Republican governors, have resisted taking strict steps, knowing that many Americans are tired of the pandemic. In the meantime, infections keep rising, and deaths have begun rising in recent days, too.
The medium-term future looks ever more optimistic, now that both Moderna and Pfizer have reported encouraging vaccine trials. But the short term will depend to a great degree on what happens in state capitals. For now, many states — like Ohio, New York and New Jersey — are announcing new restrictions that fall well short of what public-health experts say is necessary to crush the spread of the virus.
THE LATEST NEWS
The Virus
Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine is 94.5 percent effective, early data shows. It — as well as Pfizer’s vaccine — could receive initial government approval next month, but will probably not be widely available until the spring. Here’s where things stand.
The number of foreign tourists in New York will not likely return to its 2019 level before 2025, according to the city’s tourism promotion agency.
The N.C.A.A. will hold the men’s college basketball tournament next year in just one city, consolidating the normally sprawling event.
The Presidential Transition
President-elect Joe Biden urged Congress to pass a large coronavirus relief package modeled on the $3 trillion Heroes Act that the House passed in May and that then stalled in the Senate.
Biden said that “more people may die” because of President Trump’s refusal to coordinate with Biden’s transition team about vaccine distribution plans. The distribution is likely to begin under Trump and continue under Biden.
People aligned with the Republican Party dropped lawsuits in four states that challenged the integrity of the presidential election. Lawsuits remain active in Michigan, Georgia and Pennsylvania.
Biden is planning to announce some key members of his staff today: Representative Cedric Richmond of Louisiana to oversee public outreach; Jen O’Malley Dillon, who managed Biden’s presidential campaign, as a deputy chief of staff; and Steve Ricchetti, a longtime confidant, as a counselor to the president.
Robert O’Brien, Trump’s national security adviser, acknowledged that Biden appeared to have won the election. “Look, if the Biden-Harris ticket is determined to be the winner — and obviously things look that way now — we’ll have a very professional transition,” O’Brien said last week. (His remarks became public yesterday.)
Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s Republican secretary of state, told The Washington Post that other Republicans — including Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina — pressured him to throw out legally cast ballots to reverse Biden’s narrow win in the state. Graham denied the accusation.
With at least two thirds of a hand recount in Georgia done, local officials said there were no meaningful changes in results.
Other Big Stories
Hurricane Iota made landfall in Nicaragua battering a region still recovering from Hurricane Eta, which struck less than two weeks ago.
Trump asked senior advisers last week for options to attack Iran’s main nuclear site before leaving office. Aides dissuaded him from moving ahead.
Administration officials expect Trump to order the U.S. military to withdraw thousands of troops from Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia. Some of his advisers have argued that a rapid withdrawal may destabilize those countries.
The Trump administration said it would sell drilling leases to oil companies for Alaska’s Arctic refuge.
The F.B.I. recorded more than 7,300 hate crimes in 2019, the highest number since 2008.
Prosecutors charged Harvard’s former fencing coach with bribery, accusing him of accepting $1.5 million to help a wealthy businessman’s sons get admitted to the university.
Jay Clayton, a former corporate lawyer who has led the Securities and Exchange Commission since 2017,is stepping down as chairman at the end of the year. Clayton tended to favor financial deregulation.
Three Republican senators have said they oppose Trump’s effort to name Judy Shelton, a former economic adviser to the Trump campaign, to the Federal Reserve, complicating the prospects of her confirmation. Lawmakers have been skeptical of Shelton’s unorthodox views on money, her flip-flops on policy positions and her loyalty to Trump.

ARTS AND IDEAS 
Scarcity as the mother of invention
Jacques Pépin, the chef and cookbook author, grew up in France during World War II, shaped by the scarcity of those years. “I actually feel ill when I see food wasted,” Pépin has written. Much of his subsequent advice to home cooks has revolved around the artful use of available ingredients.
That skill has been especially useful during the pandemic, when many people have had to change their food shopping habits. Earlier this year, as the pandemic started spreading, Pépin began posting Facebook videos that “explained how to cook really well using the simplest and homeliest things you have in your house,” as my colleague Dwight Garner writes.
Dwight continues: “I’ve found many of his videos to be, on certain late insomniac nights, strangely and almost unbearably moving. His age, his battered good looks, his accent, the slight sibilance in his voice, his culinary erudition worn lightly, his finely honed knife skills and the ’70s-era funk of his wood-paneled kitchen: It is somehow a mesmerizing package.”
You can find the videos here. If you prefer your advice in written form, Pépin has released a new cookbook, updating one from 1990.

Congresswoman Nita M. Lowey (D-NY), Chair of the House Appropriations Committee, delivered the following remarks at the Committee's markup of the fiscal year 2021 Homeland Security bill:
I commend Chairwoman Roybal-Allard and Ranking Member Fleischmann for their admirable work on this bill in a year of unprecedented challenges. I thank the staff for their hard work to help craft the bill before us.
In the Congress, we have a special and urgent responsibility to provide the necessary resources that are critical to our security, and to respond quickly and effectively to new and emerging threats.
Since I first arrived in Congress nearly 32 years ago, and in particular after joining the Homeland subcommittee in 2007, I have been committed to doing everything possible to ensure our constituents in every corner of America are safe and secure.
We don't agree on everything in this bill, but as I reflect on this Committee's work, there is a remarkable and bipartisan track record of funding the evolving homeland security needs of our country. We have strengthened our security over the years by:
Investing in the capabilities of first responders;
Rebuilding after disasters like Superstorm Sandy;
Supporting local social service organizations that provide food and shelter to at-risk members of our communities;
Enhancing aviation security; and
Preventing and better responding to acts of terror and hate.
Nearly two decades have passed since September 11th when nearly 3,000 Americans lost their lives, including more than one hundred of my own constituents.
When I learned that first responders were unable to communicate with one another, reducing the effectiveness of the response on that tragic day, I introduced the CONNECT First Responders Act, and we created a $150 million grant program and an office at the Department of Homeland Security to ensure ineffective communications never again obstruct emergency response teams working to save lives.
We have made important progress over the years, but America is still not as safe as it should be. The sad reality is that we have seen a shocking increase in anti-Semitism and violent hate crimes in the last few years.
Three years ago, I established a $10 million non-profit security grant program for those outside of Urban Area Security Initiative or UASI regions.
This meant that non-profits outside of major metropolitan areas, like those in Rockland County, New York, could better protect themselves with increased security capabilities and have greater peace of mind. In FY 2020, this Committee successfully quadrupled that funding level to $40 million.
Shortly after the FY 2020 spending bill was enacted, a tragic, hate-filled stabbing took place in my district during a Hanukkah celebration. That anti-Semitic attack in Rockland is not an anomaly. What we are experiencing can only be called an epidemic of hate.
While non-profit security grants are not a panacea, I am optimistic that the combined $360 million this mark includes for UASI and non-UASI non-profit security grants could greatly help to prevent future attacks, particularly those aimed at racial, ethnic, or religious minorities.
This bill also addresses other growing crises.
The toll of the coronavirus pandemic is unprecedented. As a nation, we have lost more than 138,000 lives due to COVID-19, more than 18 percent of whom were New Yorkers. Our first responders continue to go above and beyond, many making the ultimate sacrifice in service to their communities and country.
These last several months have made it clear that we must do more to safeguard the American people from the real manmade and natural threats we face.
To that end, the mark includes $10.6 billion for FEMA, including $5.6 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund and $3.6 billion for Federal Assistance programs, such as the Assistance to Firefighters Grant program and the Emergency Food and Shelter Program.
This bill as a whole will strengthen our security and keep Americans safe while upholding our American values of fairness and respect. Strong investments in modern, effective technologies will improve homeland security missions, from cybersecurity and disaster preparedness to border and maritime security.
It also provides resources to meet the humanitarian needs of migrants and, critically, it prohibits the administration from raiding funds for the President's wasteful border wall.
Again, I thank Chairwoman Roybal-Allard and Ranking Member Fleischmann for their work and would like to recognize the Homeland Security Subcommittee Majority staff led by Darek Newby and my Congressional office staffer, Fae Rabin and former staffer Jennifer Becker-Pollet.
Thank you.

On this date:
In 1832, John C. Calhoun became the first vice president of the United States to resign, stepping down because of differences with President Andrew Jackson.
In 1908, a major earthquake followed by a tsunami devastated the Italian city of Messina, killing at least 70,000 people.
In 1912, San Francisco’s Municipal Railway began operations with Mayor James Rolph Jr. at the controls of Streetcar No. 1 as 50,000 spectators looked on.
In 1945, Congress officially recognized the Pledge of Allegiance.
In 1972, Kim Il Sung, the premier of North Korea, was named the country’s president under a new constitution.

In 2007, Pakistani opposition leader Benazir Bhutto was laid to rest as the country’s army tried to quell a frenzy of rioting in the wake of her assassination.
In 2014, the war in Afghanistan, fought for 13 bloody years and still raging, came to a formal end with a quiet flag-lowering ceremony in Kabul that marked the transition of the fighting from U.S.-led combat troops to the country’s own security forces.
In 2016, Actor Debbie Reynolds, who lit up the screen in “Singin’ in the Rain” and other Hollywood classics, died at age 84 a day after losing her daughter, Carrie Fisher, who was 60.
Ten years ago: Eight young people were killed in a fire that swept through an abandoned New Orleans warehouse (some of the victims were squatters who had been living inside the building). Agathe von Trapp, the real-life inspiration for eldest daughter Liesl in the musical “The Sound of Music,” died in Towson, Maryland, at age 97.
Five years ago: A grand jury in Cleveland declined to indict a white rookie police officer in the killing of 12-year-old Tamir Rice, a Black youngster who was shot while playing with what turned out to be a pellet gun. Iraqi forces backed by U.S.-led airstrikes drove Islamic State militants out of the center of Ramadi and seized the main government complex there. Ian “Lemmy” Kilmister, 70, the singer and bassist who founded Motorhead in 1975, died in Los Angeles.

1. John Harris in The Guardian
on the need to 'take back control' from right-wing bigots
 ""'The English need to rediscover who and what they are, to reinvent an identity of some sort better than the battered cliche-ridden hulk which the retreating tide of imperialism has left them,' wrote the Scots theorist and academic Tom Nairn in 1977. In the weekend's spectacle of those far-right thugs piling into London and chanting 'In-ger-land', there lies an imperative: to fight the populists and racists on their most treasured ground, and contest their archaic, hateful view of the country they think they speak for. This is not about the inanities of patriotism, but an understanding of the place we all call home, and how we interpret what is happening right now. As I watched that very different crowd throw Edward Colston into Bristol harbour, I thought of the final single put out by those great anti-racists The Clash, and two lines sung in anger and sadness that capture a challenge still unmet: 'This is England. This is how we feel.'""
2. Tim Stanley in The Daily Telegraph
on a Britain most Brits 'simply cannot recognise'
""In summary, a statue of the man who defeated fascism was defaced by anti-racism campaigners and then 'defended' by fat drunken fascists. I can imagine most of us would prefer to sit this culture war out - but on Saturday night, surveying the mayhem in Parliament Square caused by the fight over Churchill's monument, one ITV reporter saw an indictment of the entire country. He said, 'the lines that divide us are more deeply drawn and dangerous than ever'. Excuse me: no. It is highly impertinent to assume that what a mob of violent protesters thinks in any way reflects opinion in modern Britain, but this is the game our broadcast media plays. They take the most extreme views, amplify them and present them as if they were the only two choices available - as if the only options in life are madness or lunacy.""
3. Kevin Maguire in the Daily Mirror
on a prime minister deploying diversion tactics
""Cynical and a proven liar, unprincipled Boris Johnson is using the oldest trick in the Tory book by deciding to play statue wars. Unlikely to ever be on a plinth of his own, this incompetent Prime Minister will do anything to divert public attention from his Government's disastrously world-beating pandemic record. OECD experts are predicting the UK will endure the costliest slump of any major economy on top of the globe's highest excess death toll. It is a poisonous double-whammy our country cannot afford. Johnson is a toppled Neville Chamberlain, not the reincarnated Winston Churchill of his dreams... Man of letters Dr Johnson's damning declaration that 'patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel' fits the plastic patriot PM in the 21st century, just as much as it did in the 18th as William Pitt self-consciously clothed himself in the flag to deflect criticism.""
4. Claire Foges in The Times
on how criminalisation can detract from women's issue
""This lack of clarity about what misogyny means could turn the hate crime of misogyny into a grudge vehicle for the #MeToo generation to settle scores and bother the police with incidents that are not worthy of their time. Which leads to the final test this fails: it is not enforceable. Yes, there would be a scattering of cack-handed follow-ups, Humberside police-style, but in general the police are (or should be) far too busy to deal with non-crime incidents... Instead of changing the law to make misogyny a hate crime, we must do better at using existing law to prosecute and punish those who hurt women and girls. There has, to date, been one single successful conviction for female genital mutilation (FGM) in the UK. Rape charges, prosecutions and convictions in England and Wales are at their lowest levels in more than a decade; the number of prosecutions completed fell by 33 per cent over the year 2018-19. Then there is the odious 'rough sex defence', which has allowed dozens of men to claim that women died not as a result of murder but because consensual violent sex went wrong. It is in these areas that we should be pushing for more resources where required and more action where needed, not creating a new law that would open the floodgates to the reporting of trivial incidents.""

5. Michael E. O'Hanlon, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, in The New York Times
on how Bush's Iraq War survival contains lessons for 2020
""In spring 2004, it looked like a tight race, and the challenger led the incumbent in some early polls. Yet Mr. Bush ultimately won the fall election by some three million popular votes and by an Electoral College tally of 286 to 251. The economy was not in collapse at that time, as it is today. But the nation's top national safety and security problem - the Iraq war - was in a bad state and getting worse... What should this historical analogy instruct the Biden team to do in 2020? At least one thing seems clear: In choosing a vice-presidential candidate, Mr. Biden should prioritize how his political partner will help him develop, articulate and ultimately carry out a forward-looking, comprehensive plan for the chief threat facing the country today.""

""My man,"" she said, ""you are on an even keel.""
With apologies to Kipling, if you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs, you probably don't work in media.
In times of trouble, journalists are - like everyone else - defined by our identity, memories and experiences.
As the son of a retired cop who bled blue for the 37 years he was on the job, when peace officers are gunned down because of the color of their uniform - including two rookie Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies who were recently shot in their squad car - I swell with pain, sorrow and rage. Mostly rage.
As someone who cares about social justice, and once aspired to be a civil rights lawyer, I'm keen on the idea that we must confront the systemic problems of violence, corruption and racism that have helped poison the relationship between police officers and the community they are sworn to protect and serve.
And as a lapsed Catholic - who by the way isn't on speaking terms with Mother Church at the moment because of its failure to address a different sort of scandalous behavior - I can hear the wisdom in the admonition that Pope Paul VI shared with parishioners in 1972 at the Celebration of the Day of Peace: ""If you want peace, work for justice.""
I desperately want peace between the police and those who want to reform policing.
And because the murder, or even attempted murder, of police officers hits close to home, I also want vengeance.
The deputies who were wounded in Los Angeles, and who spent hours undergoing multiple surgeries at a nearby hospital, are 31-year-old Claudia Apolinar, the mother of a 6-year-old boy, and a yet unidentified 24-year-old male deputy whose parents and girlfriend kept vigil at the hospital. Video shows Apolinar heroically tending to her partner as they waited for backup, even though she'd been shot in the face. Both deputies had only been on the force for 14 months.
The suspect remains at large.
Outside the hospital, protesters heckled sheriff's deputies who gathered to show respect for their fallen comrades. One of the protesters yelled: ""I want to deliver a message to the families of the pigs, I hope they f---ing die."" The crowd chanted: ""We hope they die!""
Disgusting.
At a rally in Nevada, President Donald Trump said: ""We also believe that if you murder a police officer you should receive the death penalty.""
That works for me. I want the perpetrator of this heinous crime brought to justice, as we all should.
Otherwise, this will conclude the sympathy portion of the American people's response to public protests over police violence - and the hatred of cops it may be fueling.
I said ""may"" because there is a lot of legitimacy to the public protests we're seeing over excessive force and systemic racism in the institution of policing.
But there may also be ""rogue"" elements in the police reform movement (isn't that what police say about their bad apples?) who just want to wound, maim and kill cops because they're cops.
That's outrageous. Imagine being targeted for assassination not because of anything you did but because of what you do for a living. It should be a federal hate crime to attack cops indiscriminately just because someone is angry at anyone who wears a badge.
There is a war against cops, and the casualties are mounting.
In December 2014, New York police officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu were shot and killed in their patrol car in Brooklyn.
In July 2016, five officers were killed and nine wounded when Micah Xavier Johnson - an African American Army Reserve veteran and sniper who was angry over police shootings of Black men - ambushed and fired upon a group of police officers in Dallas.
Now, cop killing - or at least attempts at it - has come to Los Angeles.
We are forced to make binary choices. It's always ""either or."" Forget that. There is power in ""and.""
It's OK to condemn both police violence and violence against police. It's OK to be furious both at apologists for bad cops and ghouls who gather outside hospitals.
We talk about how police can regain the trust of the public. In these somber days, we are confronted with another, equally important question: How can the public regain the trust of police?
Ideas are welcomed.

96,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1001/Files (250).DOCX","The New York Times",2020-06-17,"1902 words","US; politics","Lisa Lerer, Giovanni Russonello and Isabella Grullón Paz",NA,"On L.G.B.T.Q. Rights, a Gulf Between Trump and Many Republican Voters",FALSE,"As more Republicans say they support at least some L.G.B.T.Q. protections, President Trump and party leaders continue to stand in opposition and particularly target transgender Americans.
When President George W. Bush needed to shore up support with social conservatives during his re-election run in 2004, he turned to a familiar political tactic: demonizing L.G.B.T.Q. rights. On the campaign trail and from the White House, the Republican leader began championing a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, praising unions between a man and woman as “critical to the well-being of families.”
Sixteen years later, when another issue of L.G.B.T.Q. rights popped up in the midst of another presidential campaign, the Republican incumbent responded with little more than a shrug.
“They ruled and we live with their decision,” President Trump told reporters after the Supreme Court issued a decision on Monday protecting the rights of L.G.B.T.Q. workers. “That’s what it’s all about. We live with the decision of the Supreme Court.”
For decades, most Republican leaders have opposed L.G.B.T.Q. civil and marriage rights, views that remain embedded in the party’s platform and its activist base. Last weekend, party activists in Virginia punished Representative Denver Riggleman, a first-term Republican, for officiating a same-sex marriage ceremony; they chose a self-described “biblical conservative” as their G.O.P. nominee for November. And the Trump administration continues to limit civil rights protections for transgender people and bar most of them from military service.
Yet today, widespread battles over L.G.B.T.Q. rights are less frequent among parts of the Republican Party — not just among some corporate leaders and political donors who dislike openly bigoted fights, but also among many of the rank-and-file Republicans who say in polling that they support at least some rights and protections for L.G.B.T.Q. people.
Last year, according to Pew, roughly three in five Americans said they supported same-sex marriage — up from half that share in 2004. Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, 44 percent supported same-sex marriage last year, up from 19 percent. Wide majorities of the country also support extending workplace protections to L.G.B.T.Q. Americans, according to surveys taken before the Supreme Court’s ruling.
The consensus was so broad that last year, even among white Republican men over age 50 holding favorable views of Mr. Trump, 52 percent said that workplace protections and other nondiscrimination laws should apply to L.G.B.T.Q. people, according to a Public Religion Research Institute poll.
“On L.G.B.T. rights, everyone has moved on this issue,” Robert Jones, the founder of PRRI, said in an interview, referring to voters across the political spectrum. “Whether you’re talking about marriage equality, nondiscrimination protection — everybody has moved. Seniors have moved, white evangelicals have moved, base Republicans have moved.”
In interviews this week, several Republican voters in battleground states reacted to the Supreme Court ruling by expressing support broadly for civil rights for L.G.B.T.Q. people. Some were gently critical of Mr. Trump on points, while others said the most unexpected thing about the decision was that two Republican-nominated members of the court, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, joined the court’s four more liberal justices on the majority opinion, which Justice Gorsuch wrote.
“As conservatives, they usually go by the rule of law, so I was surprised,” said Wayne Bradley, 43, a Republican from Detroit. “But I’m comfortable with the decision they made. Everyone deserves respect and with all the other things that are going on in the world, maybe that played a part in their decision. Everybody deserves protection.”
Margie Dougherty, 61, a Republican and Trump backer from Bayside in suburban Milwaukee, said she believed the president was not taking the right approach with his restrictions on transgender people serving in the military.
“If a person can perform the duties of a job or role they are hired and trained for, then they should be allowed to do the job,” she said.
For many transgender and nonbinary Americans, however, changes in public opinion can be cold comfort given that prejudice and hate crimes remain a harsh reality in their lives. In interviews, some expressed concern that the new Supreme Court ruling could take the focus away from work that still needs to be done.
“The big picture is that employment is only one of many places where gay trans people are discriminated against,” said Patrick Cognato, an English major at Binghamton University who is nonbinary. “Things like health care, housing and education are really important, too, and have a serious effect on people’s everyday lives. People can’t wait for these to be addressed because it affects them every day.”
Last year, in a separate PRRI survey, 62 percent of Americans said that in recent years they had become more supportive of transgender rights, not less. Even a slim majority of white evangelicals — a Republican bastion — said they had grown more supportive.
But it was only five years ago that transgender Americans became a political target of Republicans trying to regulate the use of public bathrooms. Some political observers believe that the Republican focus on the issue backfired — particularly when a Democrat, Roy Cooper, won the governor’s race in North Carolina after the state’s “bathroom bill” became a flash point in the campaign. That legislation required transgender people in government and public buildings to use the bathroom that corresponds with the gender on their birth certificate.
The law drew nationwide outrage, prompting companies to cancel planned expansions and move events out of the state, costing North Carolina jobs and tax revenue. Last year, the law was partially repealed by a federal judge.
Whatever the change in attitudes, however, transgender Americans remain heavily targeted for hate crimes, violence and discrimination. Black transgender people suffer disproportionate levels of police violence, and the American Medical Association said last fall that killings of transgender people, especially women of color, amounted to an epidemic.
If some Republicans have grown more accepting of L.G.B.T.Q. rights, Mr. Trump, his administration and the party leadership appear out of step with those parts of the base.
While Mr. Trump said in 2016, while running for president, that transgender people should be allowed to use whatever bathroom they feel most comfortable with, he rescinded protections for transgender students in 2017 that had allowed them to use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity. In addition to the military ban, his administration moved last week to erase protections for transgender patients against discrimination by doctors, hospitals and health insurance companies.
“I cannot think of another administration that has gone out of its way to discriminate against transgender people specifically,” said Gabriel Arkles, a senior staff lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union working on L.G.B.T.Q. rights. “There are other administrations that were terrible for transgender people — the Reagan administration’s management of the H.I.V. epidemic, Clinton’s welfare and prison reform — but these weren’t situations where they were specifically naming transgender people in their policies.”
On other issues, Mr. Trump called same-sex marriage “settled law” shortly after taking office, but he also promised to “seriously consider” a Supreme Court justice who would once again outlaw the constitutional right. Congressional Republicans and Mr. Trump continue to resist the Equality Act, Democratic-sponsored legislation that would extend anti-discrimination rules for L.G.B.T.Q. Americans. And the executive committee of the Republican National Committee decided this month to carry over the 2016 party platform, which calls for a constitutional amendment overturning the 2015 Supreme Court decision that struck down laws defining marriage between one man and one woman.
With the president’s re-election prospects looking precarious at the moment, both Mr. Trump and some party leaders appear wary of antagonizing the loyal voters and activists in the most conservative parts of his base. Yet even some leaders on the right say that opposition to L.G.B.T.Q. protections doesn’t carry the same political potency that it once did in some of the most conservative quarters of the party.
“Religious freedom and the protection of unborn lift ranks far higher in the hierarchy of the concerns from faith-based voters,” said Ralph Reed, the chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, which works to drive evangelical voters to the polls.
On the campaign trail, most Republican elected officials now generally avoid broadcasting their opposition to same-sex marriage, except in select primary campaigns in deeply conservative districts. Meanwhile, a record number of L.G.B.T.Q. candidates won seats in the 2018 midterms, with 161 openly lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people elected, according to the Victory Fund, a nonpartisan political action committee devoted to electing L.G.B.T.Q. candidates. Most were Democrats.
Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster, said that what was once a hot-button issue for voters on the right had turned into something of a nonstarter.
“There was a period of concern over where things were moving on gay marriage: that a church that refused to marry a gay couple could be sued,” Mr. Goeas said in an interview. “The fact of the matter is, nothing’s really pushed it to that extent, everything’s sort of settled down into normalcy, and I don’t sense that it’s a big issue today.”
Even as national attitudes have evolved on questions around gender and sexuality, analysts said that the Republican Party under Mr. Trump has hardly let go of cultural issues altogether. It has simply shifted toward talking more about immigration and race, including in his attacks on protesters, immigrants and black celebrities.
“The new culture war is not abortion or same-sex marriage, the new culture war is about preserving a white, Christian America,” said Dr. Jones, the PRRI pollster. A 2019 poll from his organization found that, even as many Americans’ views on race had moved to the left in recent years, 69 percent of Republicans said they believed that discrimination against white people was just as much of a problem as discrimination against racial minorities.
“That’s what Trump’s really leading with,” Dr. Jones added. “The ‘Make America Great Again’ thing — the way that was heard by most white evangelical Protestants, white working-class folks, was saying: ‘I’m going to preserve the composition of the country.’”

When President George W. Bush needed to shore up support with social conservatives during his re-election run in 2004, he turned to a familiar political tactic: demonizing L.G.B.T.Q. rights. On the campaign trail and from the White House, the Republican leader began championing a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, praising unions between a man and woman as ''critical to the well-being of families.'' 
 Sixteen years later, when another issue of L.G.B.T.Q. rights popped up in the midst of another presidential campaign, the Republican incumbent responded with little more than a shrug.
 ''They ruled and we live with their decision,'' President Trump told reporters after the Supreme Court issued a decision on Monday protecting the rights of L.G.B.T.Q. workers. ''That's what it's all about. We live with the decision of the Supreme Court.''
 For decades, most Republican leaders have opposed L.G.B.T.Q. civil and marriage rights, views that remain embedded in the party's platform and its activist base. Last weekend, party activists in Virginia punished Representative Denver Riggleman, a first-term Republican, for officiating a same-sex marriage ceremony; they chose a self-described ''biblical conservative'' as their G.O.P. nominee for November. And the Trump administration continues to limit civil rights protections for transgender people and bar most of them from military service.
 Yet today, widespread battles over L.G.B.T.Q. rights are less frequent among parts of the Republican Party -- not just among some corporate leaders and political donors who dislike openly bigoted fights, but also among many of the rank-and-file Republicans who say in polling that they support at least some rights and protections for L.G.B.T.Q. people.
 Last year, according to Pew, roughly three in five Americans said they supported same-sex marriage -- up from half that share in 2004. Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, 44 percent supported same-sex marriage last year, up from 19 percent. Wide majorities of the country also support extending workplace protections to L.G.B.T.Q. Americans, according to surveys taken before the Supreme Court's ruling.
 The consensus was so broad that last year, even among white Republican men over age 50 holding favorable views of Mr. Trump, 52 percent said that workplace protections and other nondiscrimination laws should apply to L.G.B.T.Q. people, according to a Public Religion Research Institute poll.
 ''On L.G.B.T. rights, everyone has moved on this issue,'' Robert Jones, the founder of PRRI, said in an interview, referring to voters across the political spectrum. ''Whether you're talking about marriage equality, nondiscrimination protection -- everybody has moved. Seniors have moved, white evangelicals have moved, base Republicans have moved.''
 In interviews this week, several Republican voters in battleground states reacted to the Supreme Court ruling by expressing support broadly for civil rights for L.G.B.T.Q. people. Some were gently critical of Mr. Trump on points, while others said the most unexpected thing about the decision was that two Republican-nominated members of the court, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, joined the court's four more liberal justices on the majority opinion, which Justice Gorsuch wrote.
 ''As conservatives, they usually go by the rule of law, so I was surprised,'' said Wayne Bradley, 43, a Republican from Detroit. ''But I'm comfortable with the decision they made. Everyone deserves respect and with all the other things that are going on in the world, maybe that played a part in their decision. Everybody deserves protection.''
 Margie Dougherty, 61, a Republican and Trump backer from Bayside in suburban Milwaukee, said she believed the president was not taking the right approach with his restrictions on transgender people serving in the military.
 ''If a person can perform the duties of a job or role they are hired and trained for, then they should be allowed to do the job,'' she said.
 For many transgender and nonbinary Americans, however, changes in public opinion can be cold comfort given that prejudice and hate crimes remain a harsh reality in their lives. In interviews, some expressed concern that the new Supreme Court ruling could take the focus away from work that still needs to be done.
 ''The big picture is that employment is only one of many places where gay trans people are discriminated against,'' said Patrick Cognato, an English major at Binghamton University who is nonbinary. ''Things like health care, housing and education are really important, too, and have a serious effect on people's everyday lives. People can't wait for these to be addressed because it affects them every day.''
 Last year, in a separate PRRI survey, 62 percent of Americans said that in recent years they had become more supportive of transgender rights, not less. Even a slim majority of white evangelicals -- a Republican bastion -- said they had grown more supportive.
 But it was only five years ago that transgender Americans became a political target of Republicans trying to regulate the use of public bathrooms. Some political observers believe that the Republican focus on the issue backfired -- particularly when a Democrat, Roy Cooper, won the governor's race in North Carolina after the state's ''bathroom bill'' became a flash point in the campaign. That legislation required transgender people in government and public buildings to use the bathroom that corresponds with the gender on their birth certificate.
 The law drew nationwide outrage, prompting companies to cancel planned expansions and move events out of the state, costing North Carolina jobs and tax revenue. Last year, the law was partially repealed by a federal judge.
 Whatever the change in attitudes, however, transgender Americans remain heavily targeted for hate crimes, violence and discrimination. Black transgender people suffer disproportionate levels of police violence, and the American Medical Association said last fall that killings of transgender people, especially women of color, amounted to an epidemic.

But as always, ""The Story"" continues, and we'll see you back here Monday at seven o'clock. I'm Trace Gallagher in Los Angeles. TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT starts right now.
TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening, and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Happy Friday. If you think about it, it turns out that revolutions cover a multitude of sins.
Once every conversation in your country turns political, only the politicians benefit from it. In a normal moment, the people in charge would be in deep trouble right now, the rest of us might be asking the hard questions about why things seem to be falling apart at the most basic level.
Why our streets are filthy? Why violent crime is rising? Why nothing seems to work?
We pay a lot to keep the society functioning, all of us of all parties, and suddenly we're not getting a lot in return for that. It's not a very good deal.
But in the age of BLM, our leaders don't have to answer for this. They just give speeches about social justice and they're insulated from all criticism.
If you persist in bothering them about their incompetence, they'll have you arrested for hate crimes. So revolution is the best thing that ever happened to our political class.
You see that with perfect clarity in New York City. Just a few months ago, Bill de Blasio was a national joke. Not anymore. Now de Blasio is his generation's Al Sharpton. He is a protest leader fighting in the streets for Civil Rights.
The good news is de Blasio no longer has even to pretend to run New York City. And he is not. His public schools, for example, are failing.
In New York, which is the biggest school system in the country, fewer than half the students are proficient in English and Math. That is a disaster, most of all, for the students themselves. Why is that happening? Why are the schools failing?
City officials don't want to have that conversation. Acknowledging there's a massive problem might require them to do something to fix it. Their donors and the teachers unions oppose change of any kind. Unless, of course it's a raise.
Now leaders in New York don't have to address this, they can ignore their failing schools. Instead of helping to kids to learn, the city can just blame racism and call it a day.
That may seem like a weird strategy, kind of a strange explanation in New York -- racism -- because the school population in New York is fully 84 percent nonwhite, so not that many white kids to blame. But that has not stopped the Chancellor of the school system. He recently issued a statement pledging his commitment to anti-racism and to quote, ""work every day to undo these systems of injustice.""
You'll notice the Chancellor was not more specific than that. He didn't specify which systems of injustice he was talking about, or how they work, and maybe that's because the kids with the highest test scores in New York City are not white. They're Asian.
Asian students score far higher than any other ethnic group in New York City, not just higher scores in Math, but also higher scores in English proficiency. And that seems odd.
So many of these students come from poor immigrant families where no one at home speaks English. So at first glance, these kids don't seem to have much privilege. So, how are they so successful? Well, racism, obviously. There's no other possible explanation for disparate test scores, we're told that every day.
But it must be a very stealthy kind of racism they're practicing. Indeed, this is an especially diabolical strain of racism, one that helps nonwhite immigrant kids, most of all. It is a quote, ""System of injustice that allows penniless foreigners from faraway countries to arrive here with no language skills whatsoever and still shoot to the top of the academic ratings.""
Obviously, ladies and gentlemen, what we're dealing with here is systemic racism at its most systemic.
The mayor's wife is in charge of fixing problems like this. Mrs. de Blasio was the city's systemic racism czar, but in the end, she wasn't any more specific about the problem than the Chancellor of schools had been. She didn't explain how this kind of diabolical racism actually works.
What she did say, the one thing she was absolutely confident about is that white people are to blame.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CHIRLANE MCCRAY, WIFE OF MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO: Even in 2020, to be a person of color means to live a parallel existence with white New Yorkers. That reality needs to be understood beyond communities of color. That truth must inform the curricula in our schools, our history books, the memorials we honor and even how we perceive one another.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: Oh, so the Asian kids are doing better than anyone else in school, therefore, we must tear down statues of white people. Got it. It makes sense.
Suddenly, this kind of thinking is everywhere. Here's a tape from a meeting of the Community Education Council in Manhattan. The sad part is these are some of the people who are supposed to help educate the children of New York City who badly need education.
See how many references you catch as you watch this to Reading or Math and compare them to the time these people spent attacking each other for being too white.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ROBIN BROSHI, NYC EDUCATION COUNCILWOMAN: See, it hurts people when they see a white man bouncing a brown baby on their lap, and they don't know the context. That is harmful. That makes people cry.
I take that to heart and that hurts me, and I have to learn to make you how to be a better white person.
BENJAMIN MORDEN, NYC EDUCATION COUNCILMAN: I would like to know --
BROSHI: You don't have people telling you that.
MORDEN: I would like to know before this meeting adjourns how having my friend's nephew on my lap was hurtful to people and was racist? Can you please exlain?
BROSHI: I've explained it to you. You can Google.
MORDEN: Explain it now.
BROSHI: You can read a book. Read a book. Read Ibrahim Tendi. Read ""White Fragility.""
MORDEN: I am asking you to explain what you just said.
BROSHI: Read how to talk to white people.
MORDEN: No.
BROSHI: No, it is not my job to educate you. You are an educated white male.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: That's the Education Council. Meanwhile, the students of New York City, 84 percent of them non-white, most of them can't read proficiently. What a tragedy.
But it is true. They did talk about reading for a second and the tape you saw right at the end. They'd like you to read something called ""White Fragility"" by Robin DiAngelo. ""White Fragility"" is not really a book, it what we used to call a tract, a screed, a diatribe. It is the kind of wild- eyed hate propaganda you push just before you decide to really start hurting people. It is preemptive justification for abuse.
Here's the author explaining her thesis on NBC.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ROBIN DIANGELO, AUTHOR, ""WHITE FRAGILITY"": I'll never forget asking a group, okay, so what if you could just give us feedback on our inevitable and often unaware racist assumptions and behaviors and I'll never forget this black man raising his hand and saying, ""It would be revolutionary.""
Revolutionary that we would receive the feedback with grace, reflect and seek to change our behavior. That's how difficult we are.
JIMMY FALLON, TALK SHOW HOST: Wow.
DIANGELO: That's how big a-holes we are.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: White people are a-holes and there you have the accumulated scholarship of Miss Robin DiAngelo.
Robin DiAngelo, keep in mind is probably the single most popular figure in American education right now. School districts around the country have made ""White Fragility"" required reading. Your children will almost certainly read it or be taught by people who have read it. What does that mean?
It means that schools have been closed for months now. So the revolution underway in classrooms has been hidden from your view. But you're about to find out the hard way how they've changed.
Libby Emmons is a Senior Editor at the ""Post Millennials."" She's the mother of school-aged children in New York City. Like all parents, she's worried about what's going to happen in the fall. She joins us tonight to give us a preview of what is.
Libby, thanks so much for coming on.
LIBBY EMMONS, SENIOR EDITOR, ""POST MILLENNIALS"": Thanks for having me.
CARLSON: Things seem so political in schools and so crazy in the most poisonous kind of way that I think a lot of parents are worried about what's going to happen come September. Are you worried?
EMMONS: I am worried. In fact, I have been worried for some time. It was rather interesting after George Floyd's death, my son's school at the suggestion of Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza started doing anti-racism lessons and talking about the protests and the riots and all of that.
And what was really interesting to me is that with lessons in anti-racism, they were teaching bias where perhaps none had existed before.
They were teaching my son and the students in his class which are primarily first and second generation immigrant students, that we are not equal, that in fact, white students have inherited a legacy of racism from their grandparents and parents, and that their grandparents and parents may not even be aware that they've inherited this legacy and passed it on. And that students are, you know, stuck with this and there's not really much they can do about it.
CARLSON: So there's singling out --
EMMONS: I mean, it is pretty shocking to --
CARLSON: Well, it's beyond. They're singling out children on the basis of characteristics they were born with and can't control and attacking them.
If they did this to I don't know, gay kids or kids of any -- Filipino kids, there would immediately be a government response. We'd shut the school down. You're not allowed to do that. Why is this allowed to happen?
EMMONS: Yes. It's allowed to happen because critical race theory is incredibly pervasive in the American educational system. The teachers who teach the kids in schools have studied critical race theory. They've gone through excessive anti-racist and anti-bias training and they think that this is all very normal to talk about how black children should primarily be pitied for the suffering that has come to them at the hands of, you know, the white oppressors, and that white students are primarily oppressors.
And that's -- this is the common language of our schools today and it's what Bill de Blasio is pushing. It's what the schools are pushing. It is what we saw on the Community Education Council that you showed. And it's pretty common. It's what's being taught and it's being taught to the exclusion of American History.
It's being taught to the exclusion of the belief that we're all equal under the law, that we're all equal in the eyes of God. And, you know, really, it's very un-American to teach this kind of bias, to teach racism where perhaps none existed before.
CARLSON: Yes, I mean, it's hate and it's utter poison. What can parents do -- and by the way, it also destroys trust between kids. It makes friendship impossible.
I mean, it really kind of wrecks your society faster than anything else. What can parents do about it? Why do parents feel they have to sit and accept this?
EMMONS: I don't know why parents feel they have to sit and accept this, other than they feel that they might be called racist themselves for not going along with it, as we've seen in so many different clips.
And I think that parents need to understand that pulling their kids out of school and doing homeschool and things like that might be great for their own kids. But it's not going to be great for the future of American students and the future of America's leaders.
So parents need to get involved in their public school district, and they need to speak up and they need to say, you know, the truth, which is that anti-racism, the way that it's currently being taught and the way that it's currently being indoctrinated into America's students from very low grades -- from elementary school on up -- is not American. It's not engendering equality, and it's not going to create an actual group of educated children. It's just going to create a bunch of people who feel bad for themselves and feel bad for others and are ashamed of who they are and where they came from.
It's unacceptable.
CARLSON: You shouldn't attack little kids.
EMMONS: So, parents need to get involved. Yes.
CARLSON: That's right.
EMMONS: Yes. And there's no reason to ever believe that.
CARLSON: Parents need to go ballistic.
EMMONS: Yes. And no one should ever be taught that they are more or less worthy based on skin color. I thought we knew this in America. I thought this is what the Civil Rights Movement taught us and I don't know why we're reversing course on that.
CARLSON: I'm not going to put -- I'm going to go ballistic if they try that crap.
EMMONS: Yes.
CARLSON: I think all parents should. I mean it, too. Libby, thank you so much.
EMMONS: Yes, I think you're right. Thank you.
CARLSON: So, we're in a situation where it's really individuals against the mob, online, other news organizations, CNN particularly. How can people stand up to the mob and prevail?
Chadwick Moore knows the answer, because he is one of the very few who has actually done this. Chadwick Moore, thanks so much for joining us tonight. Without getting into all the details of the debate, you took an unpopular position on Twitter a couple of weeks ago, and you were landed on by the normal online mob.
What made you different from most people I've seen is that you didn't apologize. We're going to get you fired, you were told; and you didn't move an inch. And here you are tonight. What lessons for the rest of us can you present from your experience?
CHADWICK MOORE, SPECTATOR USA: Well, you've got to understand what the mob is. You know, for people average people who have never encountered the mob, you know, and it's for them maybe the most terrifying thing they could ever imagine happening to them, being the trending topic on Twitter because they tweeted a joke that fell flat or they're caught on camera, you know, in an awkward situation or what have you.
But they don't understand that the mob is mainly for these people who are going after whatever online. I mean, not only is it by and large, just sort of leftwing nut jobs. But you know, it's not real life for these people. They live on their computer. It's a video game for them, you know.
And as soon as you sort of realize that, it doesn't mean anything. And as soon as you know that you can stand fast and stand strong in what you believe, if you're completely convinced you did nothing wrong. You know, recently in my case, I made a really funny joke intentionally to annoy two different groups of people, and it worked supremely well.
But so, but if you kind of know -- if you believe in yourself and you can send -- now average people are never going to be prepared for this and they shouldn't have to be. But if enough people start standing up to the mob and refuse to bow down to them, then we start to win.
You know, the biggest fear for many people is losing their jobs. And you know, a lot of corporations just want to avoid the headache. They don't really care. They want the easiest way out.
So if we start convincing corporations and companies to just ignore it. If everyone knows that if ever the mob comes through that it'll be over in maybe 36 hours, then I think that that starts to lessen their power.
CARLSON: I've always wondered about this, you know, people are afraid of getting fired and they absolutely should be. It's very hard to find a job. We're in the middle of a recession, it's likely to get much worse.
And so -- and I've been unemployed repeatedly. So, I know the fear and I think it's a real one. However, why do people who are about to be fired for example, telling a joke make it so easy for their employers? Why not just go completely ballistic in HR and say, you know, it's going to be a bigger problem for you if you fire me. I'm not going willingly to my fate. I'm sorry, I'm resisting. I'm going to go berserk.
You do that a couple of times, maybe they will think twice before firing you. No?
MOORE: That's right. And I think maybe a big part of it is that we just see what the mob teaches us, what all of this leftist stuff teaches us with this historical revisionism and the hatred you're seeing in the schools, like you're discussing in your previous segment, is, we now sort of know what the -- all of these conversations, none of this is really about race or whatever. It's about the line of acceptable discourse.
It's about what is socially acceptable to talk about and not talk about. And there's a very small class of people who have designed those rules, and they've done it for political power, for political reasons. They want to frighten everyone.
But there's this idea called preference falsification that was written about a lot after the fall of the Soviet Union. And it's the idea that people -- and we saw this a lot in 2016 with election polls -- it's the idea that people will not publicly express what they truly feel if it's not socially acceptable.
CARLSON: That's right.
MOORE: And that's what we see a lot with this discussion and, you know, it's so powerful that, you know, I think, even privately with their HR departments, people are thinking, yes, I really meant, you know, I don't know how I can ever defend this.
Look, I have thousands of anonymous people on Twitter calling me a racist. How can I ever defend that? I'll just duck my nose and walk into the shadows and hope I get a new job sometime soon.
CARLSON: I don't think I've ever seen a conservative on Twitter, ever, say anything half as immoral as Robin DiAngelo writes on every page of her garbage tracked ""White Fragility."" So I mean, let's just have some context. You know what I mean? It's like the bestselling book in America.
MOORE: Oh, absolutely.
CARLSON: Yes, let's get some perspective.
MOORE: And you see all of these conservatives on Twitter who -- it's almost like they believe the worst things about their own side.
CARLSON: Right.
MOORE: They're the first ones to accuse the Covington kids, if you remember that. They're the first ones to jump on anything else. So you know, that's the Team Twitter.
CARLSON: It was thrilling to see you stand up and survive. Chadwick Moore, congratulations. Inspirational.
MOORE: Thank you. Thank you.
CARLSON: We have a Fox News Alert for you. We can confirm tonight that the President has commuted -- just commuted -- the sentence of Roger Stone. That's just days before Stone was expected to report to prison for the rest of his useful and expected life.
His arrest and his trial were nakedly political. It was a setup. Stone posed no risk to law enforcement. He was a late middle aged man without a gun, and yet the F.B.I. swarmed his house in a pre-dawn raid, tipped off CNN, which was there to lovingly chronicle it and later lied about it.
The presiding judge, a political activist called Amy Berman Jackson issued a gag order that prohibited Stone from defending himself in public or making a living. She bankrupted him as a result.
Even though many public figures have faced no consequences for lying to Congress, Jim Clapper, for example, Stone was one of the few to face prison time. He would have faced more than three years again, essentially a life sentence.
So again, Roger Stone's sentence has been commuted by the President. This is good news.
Keep a sharp eye out for the ghouls out there, who will lecture you about how this is a violation of the rule of law, even as our most basic laws are ignored completely by the mob.
They don't care about the law. They care about putting their political opponents in prison and tonight, they're not going to be able to, thank God.
Joe Biden, little out of it, let's be completely honest. So, he is the perfect vessel for the activists in his party to transform the country. Details on that just ahead.
CARLSON: When Joe Biden first arrived in the U.S. Senate, sounds like a joke, actually, many of you were not alive when that happened, but it was a long time ago. Gasoline cost 39 cents a gallon. The Sears Tower had just been built. The Miami Dolphins were good.
He ran for President three times, committed quite a few gaffes. The years went on and over time, the life drained from Joe Biden like sands through an hourglass. And he became empty, in effect, an empty vessel -- perfect for the ideologues transforming his party to transform the country.
Ned Ryun has watched all of it happen. He is the founder and CEO of American Majority. He joins us tonight.
Ned, thanks so much for coming on. I think a lot of us have misread Joe Biden, because we knew Joe Biden. Anyone who has covered politics, who has been in Washington for on those, Joe Biden, most people including me have always kind of liked Joe Biden, because he's -- you know, he's a hugger, in a good way.
But that Joe Biden is gone, and then you realize that's not a defect. That's the point. That's why the party likes him.
NED RYUN, FOUNDER AND CEO, AMERICAN MAJORITY: That is the point. I mean, he is -- literally Joe Biden is now the front man for the AOC-Sanders agenda. I mean, the Democratic establishment realized Sanders was never going to cut it as the nominee in a General Election. You put Biden on the front of it, but it's the Sanders agenda in the back. It's like lipstick on a pig, still the pig of socialism.
And you realize Biden -- he is an empty vessel. He is a Trojan horse as Trump has described him. He is not writing his tweets. He's not writing whatever is in his teleprompter that he can barely even get out correctly.
And it looks like AOC and Sanders are actually writing all of his policy because they're using him to achieve their ends. They want to get universal healthcare, including for illegals, amnesty, reparations, free college, the Green New Deal.
And I will say this, Tucker, the thing that's scary about all of this, if they are given power; that is an agenda that is only accomplished by coercion. This is coercive socialism.
But to bring it even closer to home, Biden says he wants to end shareholder capitalism, and I want people listening tonight to understand it. He is talking about you.
If you have a 401(k) and a pension plan, if you're a blue collar worker, a union member, a retiree sitting in Florida living off your 401(k) or pension, a suburbanite with retirement plans, Joe Biden is saying, he is going to end shareholder capitalism. You are all shareholder capitalists. He's talking about destroying your dreams and ending your way of life.
CARLSON: I noticed he is not talking about ending private equity capitalism. Those are his donors. And he's also not talking about ending neo-conservatism, a Biden presidency would almost certainly bring us more pointless wars. So, it is a kind of corporate leftism that he is he's offering it seems to me.
RYUN: This is correct. I mean, you see the rise of the corporatism, the woke corporations that are siding with the BLM and others. And I tell people this Tucker, the thing that's pretty staggering about all of this, should Biden win, God forbid that he does, that we're not going to have free and fair elections again.
I mean, you talked about amnesty last night for tens of million -- potentially tens of millions of illegal immigrants. You tack on universal mail-in ballots, free and fair elections are over and people have asked me, can we always say this is the most important election of our lifetime. I think you have to go back to 1860 to fully understand the implications of 2020.
I mean, Donald Trump is the last bulwark for the Republic, and if he doesn't win, it's a descent to darkness.
CARLSON: I think that may be right. There are reports tonight that the President has endorsed amnesty for the DACA population. There's some confusion about whether that's true. There's a clip going around from an exchange he had on Telemundo in which he seems to say that the White House is suggesting that's not what he meant and that's not what he plans to do. Do you have clarity on that?
RYUN: I don't, but I will say this, Tucker, if he's watching, there's only one Executive Order that you should actually be signing, Mr. President. It's the Buy America Executive Order that should have been signed three months ago.
Coming into the elections, we are 16 weeks away. You should not be signing anything in any way that gives amnesty to anyone and those that are advising him to do such a thing, he needs to shut them out and follow his instincts.
I have told him, he's got some of the best instincts in politics that I've seen in years. Shut those voices out. Follow your instincts. It's what helped him win in 2016 and will lead them to victory again in 2020, but only if he shuts those voices out.
CARLSON: Yes, I don't think we need to guess who you're talking about. Ned Ryun, great to see you tonight. Thanks so much.
RYUN: Thanks, Tucker.
CARLSON: Well, the Chinese government is the main reason of course that the rest of us have had our lives suspended and our economy destroyed by the Wuhan coronavirus. They covered it up. Apparently, it came from one of their labs.
There's new information tonight about just how extensive the lying about it was. Gordon Chang has that for us, next.
CARLSON: A Chinese virologist called Li-Meng Yan is in hiding tonight after criticizing the Chinese government's duplicitous response to the Wuhan coronavirus. Here's part of what she said to Fox News.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DR. LI-MENG YAN, CHINESE VIROLOGIST: The reason I came to the U.S. is because I delivered the message of the truths of COVID-19.
If I tell it in Hong Kong, the moment I start to tell it, I will be disappeared and killed. No one can hear me. So for this purpose, I like to go to U.S. and tell the truth of the origins of COVID-19 to the world, to let people understand how terrible, how dangerous it is.
This is nothing about politics. This is a thing about whether all the human in the world can survive.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: For telling the truth, the doctor says she'll be quote, ""disappeared and killed."" This is the government, the NBA and so much of Corporate Americans and so many of our politicians suck up to, one that murders doctors for telling the truth.
This doctor says Beijing is suppressing vital information about the virus.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
YAN: There are many, many patients who don't get treatment on time and diagnosis on time. There is no protection for both doctors and the patient and common people. And also, the government doesn't allow people to release such information. Hospital doctors are scared, but they cannot talk.
C.D.C. staffs are scared. I feel very disappointed. But I already know this would happen because I know the corruption among this kind of international organization like W.H.O. to China government, to China Communist Party government.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: Let's hope she gets a chance to speak on CNN. Don't bet on it. Gordon Chang is the author of the book, ""The Coming Collapse of China,"" can't come too soon. He joins us tonight.
Gordon, thanks so much for coming on. First, the obvious, do you buy her story?
GORDON CHANG, SENIOR FELLOW, GATESTONE INSTITUTE: I do, Tucker, because she talks about a change in attitude in colleagues in Hong Kong, as well as the people that she was in contact with in China, and that occurred about the middle of January.
Well, that is consistent with what we know about the cover up in China. So the timelines match up. And that's really critical. So yes, I do believe she is not only compelling, she's also credible.
CARLSON: So why wouldn't she be a prominent voice in the discussion about COVID-19? I worry that she will not get a hearing except on this.
CHANG: Well, she carries a message that, you know, is going to be discordant with what we hear elsewhere. Because, you know, this has become like President Trump versus everybody else. And so you have a lot of people propagating China's narratives in this country, because it is politically expedient for them to do so in the short term, and of course, we are in a political season.
But as she says, this is not an issue of politics, and it's very important that we listen to what she says, because it does corroborate much of what we know about what the World Health Organization and China were doing in that critical January period.
CARLSON: What do you think -- I mean, and let me just agree with you emphatically. This isn't about the President. It's not about politics. It's about public health, which isn't served when governments lie to cover their own misdeeds or mistakes. What do you think the truth is about the origin of this disease?
CHANG: You know, we don't know. I mean, there's two main theories, of course. One of them is this was a zoonotic transfer in the wild, from an animal to human. The other is that this was an accidental release from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. And I have to say that my view is the latter one, because most diseases in China originate and these coronavirus diseases originate in southern China.
All of a sudden, we have one originating in the middle of China within 20 miles of China's P4 biosafety lab. That is extremely suspicious.
We know that a Chinese Major General was put in charge of the lab sometime around March and I believe that she cleaned up the lab to prevent the world from knowing any evidence of what was going on.
CARLSON: Because Chinese researchers reached the conclusion that you have reached, there is there is evidence that this happened. Is anybody in the so-called international community, working to find the truth and working to make sure it doesn't happen again and that nothing like this is unleashed on the world the next time.
CHANG: Yes, what we're seeing is the World Health Organization covering up for China. They've now got two researchers in Beijing to prepare the way for a third W.H.O. mission to China, but they're only studying the zoonotic transfer. They're not going to Wuhan from what we can tell. They're not going to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
So really, this is an attempt to bolster China's narrative, which was built I think -- this narrative was built by China to really divert attention away from what it was doing in that biosafety lab.
CARLSON: What a tragedy if the propaganda works as it so often does. Gordon Chang, thank you for your clarity on that. Appreciate it.
CHANG: Thank you, Tucker.
CARLSON: Well, we have some good news to report tonight on treatments for the Wuhan virus. Fox News medical contributor, Dr. Marc Siegel has been following them and he joins us tonight with an update. Hey, Doctor.
DR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Tucker, this is good news for the weekend in the world of science against COVID. Let's start with remdesivir, the antiviral drug. We reported on this all the way back in February, we were probably the first to actually interview Dr. Andre Kalil, who is the lead investigator in remdesivir.
This drug is a very clever drug by the way because it insinuates itself into COVID-19, into the SAR-COV-2 virus and the virus mistakes it for a building block. Meanwhile, the antiviral drug stops it from growing.
And tonight, Gilead has announced that their data shows that it decreases the death rate in severely-ill patients by 60 percent in the hospitals, 60 percent, and improves the quality of life, it improves clinical outcomes.
This is huge and they're coming up now with an inhaled version. The one that's out now is intravenous and the inhaled version may be able to be used much earlier.
We're getting hundreds of thousands of doses through Health and Human Services. This is a real game changer. Very exciting news.
The second news tonight is on the vaccine front, BioNTech, which is a vaccine manufacturer working together with our own Pfizer has come up with information that their first studies on what's called a messenger RNA vaccine, Tucker, this vaccine is also very clever.
It's a genetic strand of material that teaches yourselves to make the spike protein that's on the virus and guess what happens next? That protein causes an immune response.
You know, what the news is today? They have discovered that the immune response, the antibodies are greater than the amount of antibodies made by somebody recovering from COVID-19.
In fact, my inside medical sources tell me that the kind of antibodies being made are neutralizing antibodies, the very kind you need to neutralize this virus.
Next stop 30,000 people will be tested. BioNTech and Pfizer are predicting they're going to have a vaccine by the end of the year. This looks very, very promising, Tucker. Hats off to Dr. Kalil. Hats off to the vaccine scientists.
In fact, I want to give a hats off to the whole idea of science, not politics, science, battling COVID-19 in the middle of a pandemic, and winning. What a sign of hope for the weekend -- Tucker.
CARLSON: Middle of not just a pandemic, but a presidential election in which a lot of science has been rendered impossible. No, I was -- I was just thinking the exact same thing.
Some of us still believe in science, have hope in it. So this is great news. Doctor, thank you for it.
SIEGEL: Thank you, Tucker. I agree.
CARLSON: So our monuments are coming down being defaced, destroyed across the country. Nancy Pelosi, number three in line for the presidency was asked about it the other day, she says, she doesn't care. ""People do what people do,"" she said. I'll tell you what that means exactly. Stay tuned.
[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]
CARLSON: Those are pictures of statues being ripped down in Maryland and North Carolina, but it could have been Seattle or Portland or San Francisco or really anywhere in this country because it is happening everywhere.
The Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi was asked recently about this. Is she for it? Here's what she said.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): I don't care that much about statues.
QUESTION: But should not be done by a -- respectfully, shouldn't that be done by Commission or the City Council, not a mob in the middle of the night throwing it into the harbor?
PELOSI: People would do what they do.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: I don't care that much about statues. Should we care that much about statues? It's a question that Chris Bedford has thought a lot about. He's the Senior Editor of ""The Federalist."" We're happy to have him on with us tonight.
Chris, thanks so much for coming on. Why should we care about statues being toppled?
CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, SENIOR EDITOR, ""THE FEDERALIST"": Because statues are always followed by people. Every time in history, Tucker, that we've seen statues taken down from ancient Rome to France where they started with symbols like a large empty prison and then they started attacking churches to here in America where they started with the statue of a Confederate soldier and quickly moved to some mob violence, to hanging statues in the streets, to point down our founders.
Revolutionaries and mobs that go after the symbols of a civilization never just want to stop at a symbol. They're not just angry at a statue, they're angry at what it represents. What it represents is people, a civic society, this country, and they will not stop until real blood is spilled in a targeted way.
CARLSON: I don't think that Nancy Pelosi is an intellectual, but I think she is intuitive. She's not stupid, and she is certainly tough and she understands power. She must know that.
BEDFORD: She knows that. She knows that her power is not currently threatened by these mobs. They are going after some of her enemies. But her power is probably threatened because tearing down statues is all about power, just like almost these entire movements have been about, Tucker.
As you've talked about it numerous times, you go out -- you have a society that is willing to defend itself to build monuments. That's a society that believes in itself.
A society that stops building monuments doesn't believe in itself anymore, and a society like ours led by people like Pelosi who actively cheer or watch as they are torn down, that society is on its death watch.
CARLSON: A couple in her state who we interviewed on the show last night are facing hate crimes charges, whether they're convicted or not is irrelevant. Once you've been charged with a hate crime, your life is over as you know for trying to return their street to blacktop because vandals put a BLM symbol on it and they're facing a hate crime.
So it's not as if symbols don't matter to the left. They matter very, very much. How disingenuous is it for them to pretend they don't matter.
BEDFORD: Well, you know Nancy Pelosi knows full well the history of Columbus as an Italian-American. Columbus State was first celebrated after a mass lynching of Italian men by an angry mob in a race attack. That's when Columbus Day was a one off holiday.
This country made a lot of progress against persecution of Italians, and celebrating Columbus as the person who discovered our country against great odds. The son of a weaver as Ronald Reagan pointed out when he dedicated the statue in 1980.
She knows that and she's still discarded it and this, that's called a hate crime defending your street against vandals, but tearing down a symbol that was put up against hate, that's somehow okay. People do what people do.
CARLSON: Why aren't our leaders more tuned into this and why aren't they more concerned about what follows the toppling of these statues?
BEDFORD: I think they're just praying that the mob goes past them. I think they're afraid. A lot of them in Washington, D.C. who live in my neighborhood when they came to our neighborhood to tear down a statue of Lincoln and a freed man, the people hid in their homes. People were upset.
A couple of neighbors came out, but that's where Congress and senators live, a lot of them. Well, they live behind big walled-in places, and they hope that they won't be hurt.
Just like we saw in Seattle when the mayor said that going to her house, well, that was over the line or go into the U.S. Capitol, put state workers at risk. She wanted to hold the mob accountable for that.
But physically attacking police officers, shooting people in the streets and trying to lynch business owners, she felt protected from that. It was distant. They're just praying that they'll be last and King Mob generally comes for everyone at the end.
CARLSON: It does. But unfortunately, it starts with the weak and that means ordinary people and I'm not wishing for the harassment or injury of anybody, obviously, on either side. I mean that. I hate violence.
On the other hand, if people are going to be inconvenienced, you'd hope it would be our leaders because maybe they'd wake up a little bit.
BEDFORD: As you've pointed out, this is one of the only revolutions we've ever seen where the most powerful people in our society, Bank of America giving a billion dollars to this, are targeting the weakest, the most vulnerable and going after them for hate crimes.
Just like when we saw Italians defending the Columbus statue in Philadelphia, the mayor brought the full force of the law down on them. But feigned lynching and actual hangings from nooses of the statue we saw down in the south, and people being attacked, reporters being attacked, people we know being attacked. That's okay. Those are leaders that are afraid.
CARLSON: Yes, a lot of people we know are being attacked. Chris Bedford, thanks so much for that perspective. Appreciate it.
BEDFORD: Thank you, Tucker.
CARLSON: Thank you. So the question is, because it's Friday, should you go to Melrose, Massachusetts this weekend? Well, that all depends on who you are. The leaders of Melrose have sent a very clear message. We may not care about you at all. We'll tell you what that means.
CARLSON: The other day, a reassuring sign appeared on the streets of Melrose, Massachusetts, ""The safety of all lives matters,"" it read and that makes sense.
Like most places in this country, Melrose is a thoroughly multiracial town. All kinds of people live there. Most of them get along with each other because most Americans get along with each other.
The city was telling its citizens, we care about all of you, and good for them. But apparently nobody had warned the mayor of Melrose about this.
The mayor is a man called Mayor Paul Brodeur. Brodeur was outraged by the idea that Melrose would care about everyone. In Melrose, he insisted, only some lives matter. Everyone else can drop dead.
Brodeur immediately issued a public apology for the existence of the sign and then ordered an investigation into how it got there. The police department promptly launched an investigation.
So Brodeur doesn't care about all lives and he is not going to pretend that he does. Melrose, Mass is just that kind of town. So if you think about going there, you'd better check to see if you're on the approved care list before you visit. Otherwise, you can be certain they won't guarantee your safety in Melrose because they just don't care.
Meanwhile, in California, the Governor, Gavin Newsom is planning to release another 8,000 prisoners this summer. They've done a lot of that, they're doing more. He says it's to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Many local jurisdictions in the state have already emptied their holding cells. Crime rates have soared nationally. We've seen a lot of it.
Los Angeles alone released nearly 2,000 inmates in March. In May, the LA County Sheriff said inmates were deliberately trying to infect themselves with coronavirus. They wanted early release. They're not stupid.
But none of that matters in California because crime doesn't matter to the people who run it. That's when the state is already has stopped enforcing many laws. They've seen a massive rise in organized shoplifting rings, theft, and other crimes. Of course they have.
There are thousands of cases of coronavirus in California's prison system by the way. So, if you let all of these inmates out, will they infect everyone else? Of course, they will. But nobody seems to care.
Who is benefiting from this? The people who run Boise, Idaho. They're laughing as everyone with a motor vehicle in the State of California loads up with their possessions and moves to Boise.
Boise, this is for you.
That's it for us. Have the best weekend. We will be back Monday at eight. See you then."

By Leslie Bonilla
September 11, 2020 03:46 AM
The morning of September 11, 2001, is one of Aidan Thayer's first memories.
He was just 3 years old when the terrorist group al-Qaida launched a series of four coordinated attacks against the United States using four hijacked passenger airplanes. Two of the planes crashed into the Twin Towers of New York City's World Trade Center. While a third was flown into the Pentagon, the Department of Defense headquarters, near Washington. Passengers on the fourth plane, likely bound for the White House, retook control of the aircraft and crashed it into a field in Pennsylvania.
Thayer's mother picked him up from preschool in the middle of the day, frantic.
She drove to the family home in Springfield, Virginia, a 15-minute drive from the Pentagon. She set Thayer in front of the TV while she desperately attempted to call his father, Bradley Thayer, who was working at the Pentagon that day but evacuated successfully.
""There was this one shaky cam, grainy footage, of the second plane hitting the second tower constantly on the news,"" said the younger Thayer, now 22. ""I just remembered that clip looping over and over again, of just seeing the second plane, not very far away, hitting the tower.""
That day, 2,977 people died, as did all 19 of the al-Qaida hijackers, in the single deadliest terrorist attack on U.S. soil.
Nineteen years later, Thayer is a fifth-year undergraduate student at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, where he triple-majors in physics, mathematics and German. Thayer, despite his near-photographic memory, can only recall some scenes from the day of the attacks.
For older Americans, in contrast, 9/11 remains a vivid memory. Ten years later, 97% of Americans 8 or older at the time could remember exactly where they were when they heard the news, according to a 2011 survey by the Pew Research Center (https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2011/09/01/united-in-remembrance-divided-over-policies/).
For many young people, though, 9/11 is a subject learned secondhand.
""It feels like something that we learned in history books, something like World War Two,"" said Christina Liu, 22, from New York City. Liu graduated from New York University last year and will start work this month as an associated development operations engineer at Veeva Systems, a cloud computing company in California.
""It seems very distant to me, despite being an event that happened in my lifetime,"" added Liu, who found she couldn't distinguish her memories of 9/11 from her memories of a massive 2003 power outage dubbed the Great Northeast Blackout.
That's to be expected, according to research on collective memory, the pools of memory that can define social groups like generations.
In a 2016 study, Howard Schuman and Amy Corning, researchers with the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor's Institute for Social Research, compared years of survey data on the Vietnam War and 9/11 to predict how generations of Americans might remember the attacks (https://academic.oup.com/ijpor/article-abstract/29/3/520/2669470).
Their study supported the ""critical years"" hypothesis, which suggests that events happening when people are between 10 and 30 years old have the greatest likelihood of defining generations. People older than 30 may consider other, earlier events in their lives as more important to them, while those younger than 10 may be too young to fully understand the significance of an event.
""Earlier events learned about indirectly from school or media cannot have the same emotional impact regardless of their objective significance,"" wrote Schuman and Corning in the study, published in the International Journal of Public Opinion Research.
Some experts think the attacks are what sets the Millennial generation, whose members were born between the early 1980s and mid-1990s, apart from the next one, Generation Z, born beginning in the mid-1990s.
""It is 9/11 that is the defining and dividing event,"" Jack Dorsey, president of the Center for Generational Kinetics, told Business Insider in 2019 (https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-vs-gen-z-divided-by-911-different-money-habits-2019-4 ). ""Either you remember it and all the emotion that goes with it or you don't, and if you don't, then you're in Gen Z.""
Many younger Americans have grown up in a post-9/11 world, where developments like stricter airport security measures, Islamophobia or the U.S. war on terror have always been a reality.
""I wasn't really cognizant of the devastation caused that day,"" said Camryn Permann, 21, from Los Angeles, home to an estimated 70,000 American Muslims, according to a 2010 survey of religious institutions conducted by the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies.
She recalled traveling with Muslim friends and watching them be selected consistently for randomized security checks at airports.
""For me, the only part that I saw was the aftermath of widespread, nationwide Islamophobia that I've seen carried out my entire life. That's been a part of my world since then,"" said Permann, who graduated from California State University, Northridge last year, and has been working as a sign language interpreter at Purple Communications since.
Anti-Islamic hate crimes in the U.S. surged in the weeks after 9/11, according to a 2007 study in the Journal of Ethnicity in Criminal Justice (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/j222v05n01_03). The Islamic Center of Southern California in Los Angeles required police protection after receiving threats in the wake of 9/11, according to photo captions in LAist (https://laist.com/2018/09/11/what_911_was_like_in_los_angeles.php).
Sadia Fahimul, 22, a friend of Permann's, remembered her parents warning her that for her own safety, she didn't need to tell people she was Muslim.
""One time I brought it [being Muslim] up in class in middle school, and someone asked me, 'Were you sad when Osama bin Laden got killed?'"" said Fahimul, who graduated last year from Bentley University in Massachusetts with a degree in marketing. ""I think they genuinely thought that he was part of our religion, when he's not, he's an extremist. I don't even know how I answered, but I remember I was shocked that they even asked me something like that.""
Young people appeared divided on 9/11 and its complicated aftermath.
""It's just interesting to me [that] what Americans choose to remember and emphasize is an attack against Americans by people from outside of the country, but [they] aren't as concerned about attacks on people within this country, by people from this country,"" Permann said.
Permann pointed at the racism and discrimination she and other Black and LGBTQ Americans face, alongside other minority populations. She also noted the death toll from the ongoing pandemic, which has killed nearly 200,000 Americans, according to Johns Hopkins University (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html).
The surge in Islamophobia, combined with nearly 20 years of American-led conflicts abroad, is why Thayer said he thought it was ""incredibly important"" for the memory of 9/11 to be passed down to successive generations.
""It's not to memorialize it,"" he said. ""To me, you remember it [9/11] because it gives context to everything else that happened.""
After 9/11, the U.S. launched an international military campaign, known as the war on terror, targeting extremist Islamic groups throughout the Middle East, Africa and Asia.
By the end of this fiscal year on September 30, the U.S. will have spent over $6.4 trillion on its post-9/11 military involvement abroad, according to a joint 2019 study from Brown University and Boston University (http://ivanjanssens.be/sites/default/files/inline-files/US Budgetary Costs of Wars November 2019.pdf). The study is part of a larger project. Other studies in the collaboration estimated that the conflicts have killed over 800,000 people (https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/2019/Direct War Deaths COW Estimate November 13 2019 FINAL.pdf) and displaced 37 million more.

""It [9/11] was a tragedy, and we should remember that it happened, but I feel like we also need to learn more about the aftermath of it,"" said Fahimul.
""We often just say, 'Oh, remember the 3,000 lives lost' but we forget about the children and families that were killed as a result of the war that came after, all the people that are displaced and, also, people in the United States that were affected by the racism and the hate.""
For Taylor Bair, 21, from North Carolina, this extended death toll is part of the significance of 9/11. One of her friends lost her mother that day. Bair's grandmother, a flight attendant, was hours from boarding a flight to Washington when the first plane struck the North Tower of the World Trade Center complex.
""How [emotionally] close you were to this event impacts how you see it,"" said Blair, a senior at Appalachian State University in North Carolina studying psychology and special education.
""But even though it's easy to look at something you weren't connected to and ask why does it matter now, it seriously impacted the lives of thousands of people,"" she added. ""The people that did die in [9/11], they're not necessarily people who were well-known, but they had lives and they had family.""
For now, the commemorations continue, despite the pandemic. The 9/11 Memorial and Museum in New York City will reopen September 11 for families of those affected, and for the general public on the next day. Earlier in the week, officials near the site of the crash in Pennsylvania broke ground on a new part of a trail that connects the country's three main 9/11 memorials."

He is not merely complaining about liberal professors, nor is he complaining (as some of his antecedents have) that politics has no place in the classroom. He does not charge that colleges are using their tax-exempt status to make generically political speech; that would be politically incoherent because Trump has also allowed tax-exempt churches to engage more freely in political activity… In the past, he has also threatened to block funding to colleges that don’t allow conservatives to speak. But this isn’t about what speech is allowed either.</p><p>Instead . . . Trump is explicit that the problem is that schools are engaging in political behavior he deems excessively leftist. Or, put differently, Trump wants the federal government to punish the speech of private institutions based on the specific content of that speech.</p><p>Ironically, this is exactly what conservatives warned that the Obama administration was up to when it questioned the tax-exempt status of some conservative groups.

Per a poll conducted last year by the Campaign for Free Speech, 59 percent of Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 agreed with the proposition that the First Amendment should be altered to “reflect the cultural norms of today,” 50 percent favored the criminalization of “hate speech,” and 47 percent contended that the punishment for violation should be jail…</p><p>The best guarantor of free and open debate is a legal regime that strictly prohibits the government from discriminating against anyone, and the best way of maintaining such a legal regime is to decline to privilege one target of censorship over another. It is always tempting to draw distinctions between “good” and “bad” speech, but to do so in any systematic way is to abandon the mutual guarantee that is the prerequisite to keeping the First Amendment alive.</p><p><strong>Free Speech</strong></p><p>Business Insider: The Harper’s ‘letter’ proves we need to have a serious talk about free speech</p><p>By Anthony L.

Put simply, it’s the idea that there should be few limits on speech but substantial limits on the response to such speech.</p><p>“Sometimes I feel that criticisms of ‘cancel culture’ amount to an attempt to impose civility codes on the marketplace of ideas, sometimes by the same people who otherwise would be objecting to such civility codes applied to the first speaker,” White told me.</p><p>He added: “Calling a group of people a ‘mob’ is a way to avoid addressing their argument. It deprives them of agency, assumes they are taking their position out of groupthink or rage rather than because of values, and implicitly suggests that their proposition is less credible because too many people are sharing it.” …</p><p>And for those who are free-speech absolutists, the right of free association remains a tenet of the value.

Rusten Sheskey, the police officer who authorities say shot Jacob Blake in the back on Sunday, is a seven-year veteran of the Kenosha Police Department who long aspired to a law enforcement career and once described police work as “a customer service job, and the public is our customer.”
Officer Sheskey, 31, has been put on administrative leave while Wisconsin officials investigate the confrontation caught on video in which he is seen shooting while Mr. Blake leans into the driver’s side of his car. Mr. Blake remains in stable condition in a hospital, though his family’s lawyers say he is paralyzed.
State authorities said Officer Sheskey fired his weapon seven times while holding on to Mr. Blake’s shirt during an arrest. They also said that investigators found a knife on the driver’s-side floorboard after the shooting. But a lawyer for Mr. Blake’s family, Benjamin Crump, has said that Mr. Blake did not have a knife in his hand, and that he was trying to get into his car to protect his three sons, who were in the back seat.
The Kenosha police have not released Officer Sheskey’s employment file. The only disciplinary infraction that has surfaced during his time with the department was a one-day suspension without pay in 2017 for an unspecified violation of policy related to the safe use of department vehicles.
He was also sued in 2015, along with the city of Kenosha, in a personal injury case that involved a vehicle. The court docket indicates that the case was resolved a year later. He also pleaded no contest in 2014 for a traffic infraction involving his failure to obey an officer or traffic signal.
According to county records, he started his job in April 2013 after working as an officer at the University of Wisconsin-Parkside campus, which is outside Kenosha. While at the university, he responded to reports of hate crimes at the school, including one involving the discovery of nooses and a flier threatening Black students.
Officer Sheskey’s grandfather was a longtime officer for the Kenosha police, according to a department Facebook post.
Officer Sheskey was a competitive bicycle racer in high school, taking part in races as far away as Muscatine, Iowa. He has been a member of the Kenosha department’s bike squad for several years, an assignment that freed officers from the constraints of a patrol car and allowed them to interact more with the public, he told The Kenosha News last year.
“If you want to do more enforcement, you can do that,” he said. “If you want to do more public relations — go down to the lake, stop out and talk with the people — you can choose to do that as well.”
Officer Sheskey told the newspaper that “for the most part” he had always wanted to be in law enforcement.
“What I like most is that you’re dealing with people on perhaps the worst day of their lives and you can try and help them as much as you can and make that day a little bit better,” Officer Sheskey said.
He added: “We may not be able to make a situation right, or better, but we can maybe make it a little easier for them to handle during that time.”

is an American journalist and political commentator at RT. Follow her on Twitter @velocirapture23
News outlets and even police departments are ending the publication of jail booking photos, claiming they foster stereotypes because minorities are more often arrested. But hiding inequities in the system doesn't fix them.
The Sacramento Bee, the Orlando Sentinel, theHouston Chronicle and a number of other city papers across the US have curtailed the practice of publishing ""mugshot slideshows,"" image galleries showing booking photos of arrested individuals who haven't yet been convicted of crimes.
With exceptions for celebrity mugshots, suspected serial killers, ""threats to public safety,"" and ""hate crime"" suspects, the move is intended to counter racial stereotypes about criminality.
The papers have a point about the galleries' lack of context – a wordless array of scowling black and brown faces may indeed give the false impression that this is what all criminals look like. Some of the most destructive and dangerous criminals, the ones stealing your (or your parents') retirement savings or bombing civilians in the Middle East are unlikely to ever appear in one of these ""rogues' galleries"" (or, alas, to be arrested at all). And publishing a person's mugshot before they're even tried for a crime does impinge on the prisoner's constitutional right to the presumption of innocence.
But sweeping these racial disparities under the rug doesn't solve the underlying problem of black and brown people's overrepresentation in the criminal justice system. Indeed, it's quite telling that police departments are now climbing aboard the no-mugshots bandwagon, suggesting a big fat ulterior motive lurking beneath the virtuous surface. San Francisco police announced earlier this month they will no longer release mugshots to the public unless the individual poses a ""threat to the community,"" again as part of an effort to reduce racial stereotyping.
The department thus acknowledges black and brown people are disproportionately arrested for victimless crimes (i.e. those that don't pose a ""threat to the community"") – a relatively uncontroversial reality that has been public knowledge for years, though still something one doesn't expect to hear police admit.
Black people are more than two and a half times more likely to be arrested and six times more likely to be imprisoned on drug charges than whites, for example, even though blacks and whites use and even sell drugs at approximately the same rate. These aren't ""hard drug"" users either – there were more arrests for marijuana in 2018 than for ""real"" crimes like aggravated assault, arson, burglary, or sex crimes, despite over a dozen states having legalized the drug, and black people are even more disproportionately likely – 3.7 times – to be arrested for that drug.
But making a surface show of addressing stereotypes does not translate to actually dismantling racial and economic inequities in policing. Especially given the nationwide Black Lives Matter protests threatening their jobs, police who announce the end of published mugshots as a civil rights victory are more likely to be covering their arses than addressing systemic racism.
Like the mega-corporations who publicly grovel at BLM's feet (sometimes literally) in order to avoid being held to account for selling products or condoning labor practices that disproportionately harm poor and minority communities, police departments that stop publishing mugshots are seeking an easy way out of their PR problem.
Actually retraining officers to not immediately see a young black man standing on a corner in a poor neighborhood (that he happens to live in) as a drug dealer takes time and money, while merely not publishing that man's mugshot in the Sunday paper creates the same impression, as long as the police department takes care to notify the community about why it is no longer releasing arrest photos.
Unfortunately, that move does nothing to stop biased police practices, which can be shockingly difficult to dislodge. It took the intervention of a federal judge to convince New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg to curtail the NYPD's ""stop and frisk"" tactic, which at its height saw police harassing largely non-white (87 percent) New Yorkers, most of whom (88 percent) were innocent of any crime.
Given that its stated purpose was not to nab low-level drug offenders, but to get illegal guns off the street – something achieved in just 0.1 percent of stops – it was a profoundly ineffective policy.
Retraining police isn't easy, but it must be done if the US is to truly become a more racially equitable society. While corporate Democrat fronts like BLM are apparently content with cosmetic reforms and paying lip-service to social justice, black communities are devastated by the ""justice"" system, which often serves up anything but for those without the funds to buy it.
As for the newspapers, merely failing to report news that doesn't fit the narrative falls so short of real social justice as to be laughable. Is it any wonder journalism is a dying industry?

Among those facing execution is former white supremacist Daniel Lewis Lee, 47, of Oklahoma, who was convicted with another man of murdering a family of three in 1996 during a robbery intended to help fund the founding of an ""Aryan Peoples Republic"".
Lee was scheduled to be executed on Monday at Terre Haute prison in the midwestern state of Indiana, the first of three federal inmates whose executions were to take place this week.
But US District Judge Tanya Chutkan had ordered the executions halted to allow for legal challenges to the lethal injection that was to be used.
Chutkan said the use of a single drug, pentobarbital, to carry out the executions could cause ""extreme pain and needless suffering"" and may violate a constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment.
The Justice Department immediately appealed to a higher court, but the US Court of Appeals in Washington DC upheld the ruling.
""At this stage and given the timeframe in which the government requests a ruling, we cannot say that the government has made 'a strong showing' that it is 'likely to succeed' in demonstrating that the district court abused its discretion in granting the preliminary injunction,"" the appeals court said.
The Supreme Court may eventually have the final say.
Lee would be the first federal inmate to be executed in the United States since 2003 and the first since President Donald Trump announced plans to resume federal executions.
There have been just three federal executions since the death penalty was reinstated in 1988.
Lee and another man, Chevie Kehoe, were convicted in Arkansas in 1999 of the 1996 murders of gun dealer William Mueller, his wife, and her eight-year-old daughter.
According to prosecutors, the pair robbed Mueller to steal guns that they planned to sell to finance the founding of a white supremacist ""Aryan Peoples Republic"" in the Pacific Northwest.
Lee, who has since renounced his white supremacist beliefs according to his lawyers, was sentenced to death while Kehoe received three life sentences without the possibility of parole.
- 'Untenable position' -
Earlene Peterson, 81, whose daughter and granddaughter were killed, has campaigned against Lee's death sentence, saying she wants him to spend the rest of his life behind bars.
""It's an easy way out,"" Peterson told The New York Times. ""He should have to live through this. Like I did.""
Peterson and relatives of other victims also filed a lawsuit seeking to delay the execution, arguing that it was dangerous for them to travel to Terre Haute to witness Lee's execution because of the coronavirus pandemic. 
An appeals court dismissed the suit on Sunday, but Baker Kurrus, a lawyer for the families, said he would take it to the Supreme Court.
""The federal government has put this family in the untenable position of choosing between their right to witness Danny Lee's execution and their own health and safety,"" Kurrus said.
The Bureau of Prisons said Sunday that a member of the Terre Haute prison staff had tested positive for COVID-19.
""There's no reason for anybody to be carrying out executions right now because of the pandemic,"" said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center.
More than 1,000 US religious leaders urged Trump last week to abandon plans to resume federal executions and Dunham accused the president of ""political use of the death penalty.""
Trump, who faces a tough re-election battle in November, has called for stepped-up use of capital punishment, especially for killers of police officers and drug traffickers.
Only a handful of US states, mainly in the conservative South, still actively carry out executions. In 2019, 22 people were put to death.
Most crimes are tried under state laws, but federal courts handle some of the most serious crimes, including terror attacks and hate crimes.

The deleterious impact of the ""digitization of antisemitism"" was revealed in the 2020 State of Antisemitism in America report recently issued by the American Jewish Committee (AJC).
Twenty-two percent of American Jewish adults have experienced antisemitism online or on social media in the last five years. Of this group, 62% said they had been the targets of antisemitic remarks on Facebook, 33% on Twitter, 12% on Instagram and 10% on YouTube.
The impact of hate Jews are experiencing online mirrors the experience with more traditional forms of antisemitism. While 24% say they avoid wearing, carrying or displaying things that might identify them as Jews, and 31% avoid certain places, events or situations out of concern for their safety, the AJC survey also found that 24% who are active on social media avoid posting content that may identify them as Jewish.
""We all need to send the message that antisemitism in any form is unacceptable on or offline,"" Holly Huffnagle, AJC's US director for combating antisemitism, told the Inter-parliamentary Task Force on Online Antisemitism last month.
Findings in AJC's second annual comprehensive survey of US Jewish perceptions of and experiences with antisemitism in the United States reflect the fast-moving changes in how antisemitism is transmitted.
""Digitization of antisemitism is the farthest-reaching battleground. What happens online doesn't stay online,"" says Huffnagle, recalling that the hate-filled individuals who carried out the murderous assaults at Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue and Chabad of Poway posted threatening manifestos shortly before their attacks.
One essential tool to combat antisemitism is keeping law enforcement informed. But 76% of American Jews who have experienced an antisemitic incident do not report it at all, and only 4% tell the police.
This reluctance concerns top law enforcement officials across the country. ""You are going to lose every case you do not charge,"" Ohio Attorney-General Dave Yost said on an AJC Advocacy Anywhere program, in an appeal to ""victims of hate crimes who have declined to report because they feel nothing is going to happen.""
But a perceived lack of responsiveness also may inhibit willingness to report. Nearly half (46%) of American Jews who reported online antisemitism to a social media platform said that nothing was done to address the incident.
THE AMASSING of hate, and specifically antisemitism, online demands attention and action by the leaders of the technology giants. The creators of top social media platforms may have begun with good intentions pioneering global communications, but as some veteran social media executives admitted in the Netflix documentary, The Social Dilemma, the consequences of people and groups imbued with hate and limitless reach were underestimated or ignored.
""Freedom of speech must never be confused with freedom to incite violence and hatred,"" New York Attorney-General Letitia James said on the AJC program where Yost appeared.
Putting the evil social media genie back in the bottle is an enormous challenge. Facebook, for one, has taken steps to ban certain antisemitic stereotypes as well as Holocaust denial and distortion. It's a methodical process, relying heavily on human moderators, who can follow-up on what the algorithms are missing.
""Facebook has two billion users worldwide, but 90% of them do not live in the United States and Canada,"" Monika Bickert, Facebook's vice president of content policy, explained on a recent AJC Advocacy Anywhere program. Training moderators to identify what constitutes antisemitic posts is imperative.
But users also need to learn what is antisemitic, and whether they are engaging in it online or offline. AJC's survey of the general American population, also part of the State of Antisemitism in America report, found that only 53% of Americans are familiar with the term ""antisemitism."" Another 25% acknowledged that they do not know what the word means even though they said they have heard it, and 21% said they had never heard the term ""antisemitism.""
The correlation between awareness and education level is pronounced. Thirty-six percent of those with a high school diploma or less, 14% with some college, and 9% with a college degree were among the 21% who are totally unaware of the term antisemitism.
While 82% of American Jews said antisemitism in the US has increased over the past five years, 47% of the general population who have completed at least some college agreed, compared with 36% of those with less education.
In the US, the adage ""what begins with Jews doesn't end with Jews,"" is not resonating throughout American society, even though some elected officials, religious and ethnic leaders have recognized and declared that antisemitism is a problem for all to address.
Ignorance is a significant obstacle to developing and implementing concrete actions aimed at containing and pushing back the proliferation of antisemitism. Those involved in the business of education, including social media firms, should lead in making the battle against antisemitism a national priority.

They posit that the built environment serves as a heuristic device, providing cues about likely levels of neighborhood crime, independent of the effects of neighborhood crime itself. Using data on 4,456individu- als nested within 100 census tracts, the authors estimate hierarchical logistic models of perceived community crime risk. They focus on the role of the neighborhood built environment in the form of aggregated perceptions of nonresidential land use, while controlling for individual-level criminal opportunity, community-level social struc- tural antecedents, and community-level objective crime. The findings indicate that the neighborhood-level presence of businesses and parks and playgrounds increases individual perceptions of community danger, but these effects disappear once neigh- borhood crime rates are controlled. The presence of schools has no effect on subjec- tive interpretations of community crime, regardless of whether actual area crime is considered. Keywords: community; risk; fear If a healthy community is in part defined as one in which residents feel safe from crime, regardless of objective crime risk, then understanding the complex nexus of factors involved in subjective risk perception is an impor- tant task. Although previous studies have addressed this complex nexus of factors in micro-, macro-, and multilevel studies, an interesting omission from previous investigations is an examination of the contextual effects of the physical, built environment. Yet the physical environment seems particularly Address all correspondence to Pamela Wilcox, Department of Sociology, University of Ken- tucky, 1531 Patterson Office Tower, Lexington, KY 40506-0027; e-mail: pwroun1@uky.edu An earlier version of this article was presented at the annual meeting of the American Sociologi- cal Association, Chicago, Illinois, August 2002.

Because the built en- vironment is externally ""obvious"" to residents--especially in comparison to social structure, typically the focus of contextual studies--it would stand to reason that it serves as a strong heuristictool in shaping publicopinion about community crime risk (Schneider et al. 1999). The present study addressed this possibility by estimating multilevel models of perceived community crime risk, incorporating both individual- level predictors as well as environmental ones, including characteristics related to the social structure and the physical structure. More specifically, using data on 4,456 individuals nested within 100 Seattle, Washington, neighborhoods, we estimated hierarchical logistic regression models of indi- vidual perceptions of community crime risk, focusing on the effects of citizen- reported public land use while controlling for individual-level victimization risk factors, community social structure, and community ""objective"" crime. Through this analysis, we aimed to delineate the extent to which aspects of the physical environment--public land uses, in particular--serve as a heuris- tic tool in shaping individual residents' perceptions of crime risk, net of indi- vidual-level differences, social structural conditions, and in particular actual crime. PERCEPTIONS OF CRIME RISK: PREVIOUS STUDIES Studies of perceived crime risk--conceptualized as a cognitively based assessment of safety and risk (Ferraro and LaGrange 1987)--have revealed relatively consistent findings for both micro and macro predictors.1 Impor- tant micro-level effects include sociodemographic characteristics: Being female, elderly, poor, or non-White tends to heighten perceived risk (Baumer 1979; Chiricos, Hogan, and Gertz 1997; Ferraro 1995; Garofalo 1979; LaGrange and Ferraro 1989; Lewis and Salem 1986; Liska, Sanchirico, and Reed 1988; Wilcox Rountree and Land 1996a, 1996b), though such effects can be conditional on neighborhood crime (Maxfield 1984).2 Other individual- level factors that appear important are routine activities or lifestyle character- izations, including involvement in ""dangerous"" public activities, leaving the home unoccupied, carrying valuables or money in public, and engaging in safety precautions (Wilcox Rountree and Land 1996a, 1996b). The evidence is more mixed regarding the effect of individual-level victimization experi- ences on risk perception, but several studies have found that respondents'vic- timization experiences increase concern about area crime or perceptions of area safety (Ferraro 1995; Garofalo 1979; Lee and Ulmer 2000; Liska et al. 1988; Skogan 1987; Taub, Taylor, and Dunham 1981). Important macro- Wilcox et al. / CRIME RISK INTERPRETATION 323 level effects on perceived risk merging from the extant literature include pop- ulation density (Lee and Ulmer 2000; Liska, Lawrence, and Sanchirico 1982); poverty (Skogan 1990; Wilcox Rountree and Land 1996a, 1996b); the proportion of the population that is non-White (Chiricos et al. 1997; Covington and Taylor 1991; Liska et al. 1982; Taylor and Covington 1993);3 social cohesion (Lewis and Salem 1986; Wilcox Rountree and Land 1996a, 1996b); community crime (Lewis and Salem 1986; Liska et al. 1982; Wilcox Rountree and Land 1996a, 1996b);4 local homicide media coverage (Liska and Baccaglini 1990); and social and physical disorder (Ferraro 1995; LaGrange, Ferraro, and Supancic 1992; Lewis and Maxfield 1980; Lewis and Salem 1986; Skogan 1990; Skogan and Maxfield 1981; Taub et al. 1981; Wilcox Rountree and Land 1996a, 1996b), including, more specifically, the presence of teenage groups (Taylor and Covington 1993). Recent multilevel theorizing on subjective crime-related reactions, including cognitively based risk perception and emotionally based fear or anxiety, have suggested that the micro and macro factors above are both important in formulating such reactions because they represent criminal opportunity (Ferraro 1995; Wilcox Rountree 1998). Drawing on Ferraro (1995). Lee and Ulmer (2000) stated, An individual's assessment of risk involves interpretation of one's exposure to the chance of injury or loss. Estimation of risk thus entails defining a poten- tially problematic situation. One can never be certain of the risks of victimiza- tion. One can only gather the information related to the risk and make a judge- ment about it. (P. 1176) The fact that this ""information related to the risk"" comes simultaneously from multiple levels of analysis is important. Lee and Ulmer stressed this in saying, ""The risk interpretation model is an individual- and community-level theory. To leave out either individual experiences and perceptions or commu- nity-level characteristics is to have an impoverished and incomplete explana- tion"" (p. 1177). Although many individual- and community-level aspects of this risk interpretation have been addressed in previous studies (see above), a particularly neglected community-level risk factor is community physical structure. Most extant studies that have addressed the role of the physical environ- ment in understanding risk perception are those typically community-level studies that have examined the effects of physical incivilities (see, e.g., Taylor 1987, 2001; Taylor, Schumaker, and Gottfredson 1985; Wilson and Kelling 1982). Taylor and Covington (1993) described clearly the role of physical incivilities such as litter, broken windows, and graffiti within macro models of ""fear"" or risk: 324 JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY Community structure affects the ability of residents to informally control their streets and to fend off crime and fear. Fear of crime models incorporating incivilities elaborate this core proposition by pointing to specific physical and social cues which inform residents about safety and informal control on the street. Residents infer attenuated informal controls from more extensive incivilities. (Pp. 390-91) Physical incivilities are particularly visible environmental cues signaling criminal opportunity or risk to an individual within that context. And as al- ready indicated, there is substantial empirical evidence that physical incivili- ties do indeed heighten subjective perceptions. But aside from incivilities, other aspects of the built physical environment seem important in assessing cognitive risk perception. Merry (1981:413) addressed this issue in her study of the Dover Square housing project: Each resident has a mental topography of the relative safety and danger of the various locations in the project which he develops through his own experience, information from friends and relatives, and his response to the visual character- istics of the buildings and their layouts. (P. 413) She compared these cognitive maps of ""perceived dangerous locations"" to actual robbery locations. Merry clearly discerned discrepancies between the perception of danger and the actual danger presented by certain physical lo- cations. She noted that [the] discrepancies suggest that places appear dangerous not simply because of the frequency of crime but also because of their design, their familiarity, resi- dents' anticipation that someone will intervene to help them, and the behavior and reputations of their habitual users. (P. 413) Subsequent site-specific work has supported Merry's findings, suggesting that features of the built environment such as poor building design (e.g., those with alcoves, niches, blind spots), poor lighting, and overgrown landscaping-- all allowing for refuge while disallowing prospect and escape--increase per- ceptions of crime risk (Brantingham and Brantingham 1994; Fisher and Nasar 1992, 1995; Kirk 1988; Warr 1990).5 Physical environment­perceived risk linkages most relevant to the present study's focus on nonresidential land use at the neighborhood level have also been found. Taub et al.'s (1981) study of eight Chicago neighborhoods, for instance, revealed that land uses af- fected risk perception. More specifically, renters living in close proximity to parks or playgrounds, alleys, or other open spaces experienced heightened victimization risk perception. However, Taub et al. did not estimate these ef- fects within the context of a multilevel model, and thus their estimates of con- Wilcox et al. / CRIME RISK INTERPRETATION 325 textual effects might be inefficient. In fact, no study to date that we are aware of has examined the possible direct effects of land use on risk perception within a multilevel model. Building on the above-cited work, we assumed that the effects of public land use on risk perception are direct and net of actual crime. We posited that public land use can provide to residents risk-related cues in terms of the repu- tation of users and the likelihood of supervision and intervention. We sus- pected that the information conveyed by such cues might be at odds with actual community crime risk as indicated by objective crime rates, and thus the effects of public land use would be net of actual community crime. DATA AND METHODS In examining these potential direct effects of public land use, we have extended previous work invoking multilevel risk interpretation models (Ferraro 1995; Lee and Ulmer 2000). We estimated this conceptual model using a hierarchical modeling approach and the MLWin software specifically (Goldstein et al. 1998; see also Kreft and deLeeuw 1998). This modeling strategy accounts appropriately for the inherently nested data structure, with individuals distributed nonrandomly within neighborhoods. In short, the multilevel models estimated here, unlike ordinary least squares models, appropriately account for the dependence of observations within groups because it is likely that individuals within the same neighborhood are more similar to one another than individuals from different neighborhoods. Each of the levels in the structure of the data--individuals and neighborhoods--is represented with a submodel. These submodels, along with nested error terms, account for variation in crime risk perception at each of the levels (see, e.g., Bryk and Raudenbush 1992; Kreft and DeLeeuw 1998). The general level 1 model estimated for each individual (i) in neighborhood (j) is of the following form: Logit (Risk Perception)ij = 0j + 1jX1ij + 2jX2ij + . . . kjXkij + eij, (1) where X1, X2, . . . Xk represent individual-level variables, the kj terms are lo- gistic regression coefficients (or intercepts, as in the case of 0j), and eij is a level 1 error term assumed to be distributed binomially. The level 2, or neigh- borhood-level, model is a normal-errors regression model of the following general form: kj = k0 + k1W1j + k2W2j + . . . kqWqj + ukj, (2) 326 JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY where W1, W2, . . . Wq represent neighborhood-level variables, the kq terms are regression coefficients (or intercepts) to be estimated, and ukj is a nor- mally distributed error term. Data for our multilevel study of subjective crime risk came from a 1990 survey of 5,302 Seattle residents (Miethe 1992). Respondents were selected for study on the basis of a multistage sampling design. First, 100 of Seattle's 121 ""stable"" census tracts were randomly chosen.6 Three neighborhoods--or pairs of blocks--were then selected from within each of the 100 tracts, leav- ing 300 sampled block pairs. Because the original study was partially moti- vated by the study of crime displacement across contiguous blocks, a crite- rion for selection was that one of the blocks in each selected pair had experienced at least one reported burglary within the previous year, while the other block adjoined. On average, 18 individuals were surveyed within each selected block pair, using a reverse telephone directory, creating a total sam- ple of 5,302 Seattle residents. We focused on respondents nested within cen- sus tracts here. In the present study, the census tract was used instead of the block-pair unit because census data were readily matched to these units, and they are commonly used as neighborhood approximations in community- level research (Bellair 2000; Warner and Wilcox Rountree 1997). The listwise deletion of cases with missing values left 4,456 individuals within 100 census tracts for the analyses presented herein. Measures of Variables The dependent variable for this study was community crime risk percep- tion. Perceived community crime risk was measured as a dichotomous vari- able (1 = yes, 0 = no), indicating whether or not the respondent felt that his or her neighborhood was unsafe from crime at the time of the survey. This dichotomous measure was attained by recoding a four-category, ordinal- level response set. Those respondents indicating that they felt very or some- what unsafe were combined (and coded as 1 = unsafe), whereas those feeling somewhat or very safe were coded as 0. As the descriptive statistics in Table 1 suggest, 24 percent of the respondents perceived their neighborhoods to be unsafe.7 Individual-level explanatory variables were largely derived from criminal opportunity theory, with the assumption being that opportunity (indicated by exposure, target attractiveness, and guardianship) shapes risk interpretation. In particular, exposure to crime was operationalized with two separate mea- sures. First, we measured exposure as the number of nights per week a respondent left his or her home unoccupied. We also measured exposure as the number of dangerous public activities in which a respondent was recently involved, including whether or not the respondent had visited bars or Wilcox et al. / CRIME RISK INTERPRETATION 327 328 TABLE 1: Descriptive Statistics for Study Variables Descriptive Statistics Variable Metric M SD Minimum Maximum Dependent variables Crime risk perception (1 = unsafe, 0 = safe) .24 .43 .00 1.00 Individual-level explanatory variables Age (1 = 10-19 years to 7 = 70 years and older) 4.26 1.68 1.00 7.00 Sex (1 = male, 0 = female) .51 .50 .00 1.00 Race (1 = non-White, 0 = White) .14 .34 .00 1.00 Family income (1 = < $10,000 to 7 = > $100,000) 3.41 1.36 1.00 7.00 Home unoccupied (number of nights per week) 1.87 1.98 .00 7.00 Dangerous activities (number of activities) .90 .82 .00 3.00 Household goods (number of items owned) 2.60 1.40 .00 5.00 Carried valuables (number of times per month) 3.22 2.61 .00 8.00 Safety precautions (number of precautions) 4.21 1.47 .00 9.00 Live alone (1 = yes, 0 = no) .25 .44 .00 1.00 Burglary victimization (1 = yes, 0 = no) .18 .38 .00 1.00 Violent victimization (1 = yes, 0 = no) .03 .17 .00 1.00 Neighborhood-level explanatory variables Poverty (residents below poverty/total tract population) .12 .10 .02 0.57 Proportion non-White (non-White residents/total tract population) .23 .22 .04 .87 Residential stability (residents of five or more years/tract population) .44 .12 .15 .66 Business places (number of total reported business places within three blocks/total survey respondents) 2.73 1.06 .88 5.46 Schools (number of residents living within three blocks of a school/total survey respondents) .17 .20 .00 .79 Playgrounds (number of residents living within three blocks of a playground/total survey respondents) .57 .23 .01 .98 Burglary rate (number of burglaries per 100 tract households) 7.40 3.84 1.81 18.52 Violence rate (number UCR Part I violent crimes per 100 persons) 2.78 3.43 .10 14.91 NOTE: UCR = Uniform Crime Reports.Descriptive statistics are based on 4,456 individuals within 100 neighborhoods (census tracts). nightclubs during the previous week, whether or not the respondent had vis- ited places where teens hang out during the previous week, and whether or not the respondent had used public transportation. Target suitability was measured with several variables. We measured this construct first as the number of times in the month preceding the survey that a respondent indicated having carried valuables (more than $50 in cash or more than $100 in jewelry). Target suitability was also measured as the number of portable, expensive household goods owned, including color TVs, VCRs, 35-mm cameras, home computers, and bicycles or motorcycles. A nonsocial dimension of individual-level guardianship was measured by summing individual responses to nine dichotomous (1 = yes, 0 = no) survey items asking respondents whether or not they engaged in safety precautions, including locking doors, installing extra locks, leaving lights on (or using light timer devices), owning dogs, belonging to neighborhood watch associa- tions, having neighbors watch their homes, owning weapons, carrying weap- ons, and owning burglar alarms. The resulting safety precautions index had possible responses ranging from 0 to 9. A social dimension of guardianship was tapped with a dichotomous variable measuring whether or not a respon- dent lived alone (1 = yes, 0 = no). Because previous victimization is likely to affect risk perception, we con- trolled for (1) whether or not (1 = yes, 0 = no) a respondent was a victim of stranger violence (assault or robbery) within four blocks of his or her home and within the two years preceding the survey and (2) whether or not (1 = yes, 0 = no) the respondent's current home had been burglarized (including attempts) in the two years preceding the survey. In addition, because sociodemographic characteristics are often presumed proxy measures for exposure, target attractiveness, and guardianship (e.g., see Cohen et al. 1981), these were controlled in our analyses. Age was measured as an ordinal variable with a seven-item response scale, with 1 = 10 to 19 years of age and 7 = 70 years of age or older. Sex and race were both dichotomous measures, with 1 = male and 1 = non-White, respectively. Finally, family income was mea- sured by way of a seven-item ordinal scale, with a score of 1 representing respondents with annual family incomes of less than $10,000 and a value of 7 characterizing respondents with family incomes of greater than $100,000. The neighborhood-level explanatory variables of interest in this study included poverty, minority concentration, stability, the presence of business places, the presence of schools, the presence of playgrounds, area burglary rates, and area violent crime rates. The social structural variables all came from 1990 U.S. census tract data. Poverty was measured as the proportion of total tract residents living below the official poverty line. Minority concentra- tion was measured as the tract-level proportion of non-White residents. Wilcox et al. / CRIME RISK INTERPRETATION 329 Residential stability was measured as the proportion of total tract residents (aged five years or over) who had lived in the same house for at least five years. To tap neighborhood-level publicland use, we examined nine dichoto- mous (1 = yes, 0 = no) survey items asking respondents about the presence of various publicland uses within three blocks of their homes. The results of a factor analysis of these items are depicted in the Appendix. The items loaded onto two factors--the first seemingly representing the perceived presence of commercial or business places and the second representing the perceived presence of nonbusiness, resident-centered public land use.8 Item 9--a bus stop within three blocks--loaded poorly on both factors and was thus dropped from further analysis. The six items loading onto the first factor were summed, creating a measure of the total perceived number of business-ori- ented establishments within three blocks of each respondent's home ( = .72). These scores were then aggregated within each tract, creating neighbor- hood-level scores representing the average number of businesses within three blocks of respondents' homes, thus tapping the general presence of commer- cial land use within the community. The two items loading onto the second factor--living within three blocks of a school and living within three blocks of a playground--were not combined because of an unacceptably low reli- ability coefficient ( = .26). Instead, they were examined in the analysis pre- sented herein as separate, single-item measures. Each of these items was aggregated within neighborhoods, creating, respectively, the proportion of respondents reporting that they lived within three blocks of a school (tapping the general presence of or proximity to schools) and the proportion of respon- dents reporting that they lived within three blocks of a park or playground (tapping the general presence of or proximity to parks or playgrounds).9 We measured area burglary and violent crime rates using 1989 and 1990 tract-level data from the Seattle Police Department. The burglary rate repre- sents the two-year average tract-specific rate of reported burglaries per 100 tract households. The violent crime rate represents the two-year average tract-specific rate of reported Uniform Crime Reports Part I violent crimes (homicides, rapes, aggravated assaults, and robberies) per 100 tract persons. RESULTS Individual-Level Effects Given the data and measures described above, an initial random-coeffi- cient regression model for crime risk perception was first specified. Initial examination of the cross-tract variation in all kj revealed that only 0j and 3j 330 JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY were significantly variable across contexts. As a result, all other coefficients were specified as fixed at level 2 in the model shown here. This ""reduced"" random-coefficient model for crime risk perception was specified as follows for the level 1 model: Logit (crime risk perception)ij = oj j + 1 Ageij +2j Sexij + 3j Raceij + 4 j Family Incomeij + 5 jHome Unoccupiedij + 6 j Dangerous Activitiesij + 7 j Household Goodsij + 8 j Carried Valuablesij + 9 j Safety Precautionsij + 10 j Live Aloneij + 11 j Burglary Victimizationij + 12 j Violent Victimizationij + eij (3) The model was specified as follows for the level 2 model: 0 00 0 j j u = + 3 30 3 j j u = + kj k = 0, for k = 1, 2, 4 to 12 (4) Table 2 presents the results of this model specification. As can be seen, the level 2 variance component for mean crime risk perception--shown in the random-effects portion of the table--was significant. We can thus infer that mean crime risk perception did vary significantly across Seattle neighbor- hoods. This suggests that contextual effects, net of individual-level factors, are important in understanding crime risk perception. Also, the effect of race on risk perception varied across neighborhoods, implying that neighbor- hood-level factors interact with race in predicting perceived risk. Although the model presented in Table 2 shows that cross-neighborhood variation did exist for mean risk perception and the effects of race thereon, the focus of the model was on the individual-level effects on crime risk percep- tion. As can be seen in the fixed-effects panel of Table 2, 7 of the 12 individ- ual-level predictors included in the model had significant effects on crime risk perception. For example, age was negatively related to crime risk percep- tion. The exponentiated coefficient shows that for every one-unit increase on the ordinal age scale, the odds of assessing the community as unsafe decreased by 5 percent. Similarly, Table 2 demonstrates that men, as opposed to women, were less likely to perceive their communities as unsafe. For example, the odds of unsafe perceptions were nearly 22 percent lower for men than for women. Another individual-level characteristic that signifi- cantly affected one's community crime risk perception was race. The odds of assessing the community as unsafe were 34 percent lower for non-Whites than for Whites. Table 2 shows that family income also had a significant neg- ative impact on crime risk perception. The exponentiated coefficient demon- strates that as family income increased by one unit on the ordinal scale, the odds of assessing one's community as unsafe decreased by nearly 7 percent.10 Wilcox et al. / CRIME RISK INTERPRETATION 331 In addition to the sociodemographic variables of age, sex, race, and income, there were other individual-level factors that influenced one's per- ception of community crime risk. For instance, the number of safety precau- tions an individual took was positively related to how unsafe he or she per- ceived the local community to be. Table 2 shows that for every additional safety precaution in which an individual engaged, the odds that he or she saw the local community as unsafe increased by 11 percent. Although this finding may seem counterintuitive at first glance, it makes sense in that individuals are likely to take safety precautions in response to risk perception. Yet engag- ing in the precautions does not necessarily alleviate the assessment of crime risk. This is especially plausible given that the measure of individual-level risk assessment examined here was ""global"" (e.g., assessing the generalized risk of community) rather than ""specific"" (e.g., assessing the individual like- lihood of experiencing victimization, personally). Finally, as might be expected, those who had been the victims of violent crime or burglary were more likely to perceive their communities as unsafe than those who had not experienced these types of victimization.

These findings indicate that past community-based victimization has a significant positive impact on one's current perceptions of community crime risk. Neighborhood-Level Effects We next estimated four contextual models in which census tract­level indicators of resident-reported land use, social structural characteristics, and violent and burglary crime rates were added to the model in an attempt to account for level 2 variability in mean crime risk perception. Thus, we adjusted the level 2 model as such (the level 1 model stayed the same), noting, however, that violent and burglary crime rates were entered in a stepwise fashion throughout a series of four contextual models.11 For the level 2 model, 0 00 01 j = + Poverty j +02 Proportion Non-white j +03 Residential Stability j +04 Business Places j +05 Schools j +06 Playgrounds j +07 Violent Victimization Rate j +08 Burglary Victimization Rate j j u + 0 3 30 3 j k u = + kj k k = = 0 1 2 4 12 , , , for to . (5) Table 3 presents the results of these four contextual models. The introduc- tion of neighborhood-level variables generally decreased the cross-community variation in crime risk perception. Compared to the variance component in Table 2, the variance components displayed in the contextual models repre- sent declines ranging from 68 to 76 percent. Despite these declines, crime risk perception continued to remain significantly variable across census tracts in all contextual models, suggesting that the contextual models were only moderately successful overall in accounting for neighborhood-level variation in subjective crime risk. Model A in Table 3 includes the land-use and social structural level 2 vari- ables, excluding the variables controlling for neighborhood violent and bur- glary crime rates. Model A shows that poverty, proportion of the population that is non-White, the aggregate perception of business places, and the aggre- gate perception of playgrounds were all significantly and positively related to community crime risk perception. Model A also shows that residential stabil- ity was significantly and negatively related to crime risk perception. In model B, the tract-level violent crime rate was controlled. When this variable was added to the model specification, it, along with poverty, was significant and Wilcox et al. / CRIME RISK INTERPRETATION 333 positively related to crime risk perception. In addition, residential stability continued to be negatively related to crime risk perception. However, propor- tion of the population that is non-White and the previously significant land- use variables, the aggregate perception of business places and the aggregate perception of playgrounds, were no longer significant. Thus, most impor- tantly for the purposes of this article, the effects on risk of the built environ- ment in the form of aggregate perceived public land uses do not appear to be net of objective levels of violent crime. In model C, neighborhood-level violent crime rate was removed, and the neighborhood-level burglary rate was incorporated instead. As model C demonstrates, official neighborhood burglary was significantly and posi- tively related to crime risk perception. Similar to model B, poverty was also positively related to risk perception. In addition, residential stability contin- ued to have a significant, negative impact on crime risk perception. However, in contrast to the results reported in model B, proportion of the population that is non-White, the aggregate perception of business places, and the aggre- gate perception of playgrounds became significant once again, suggesting that these effects were net of objective community burglary risk. Finally, model D in Table 3 included both the violent and burglary crime rates. As in model B, the effects on crime risk of proportion of the population that is non-White, the aggregate perception of playgrounds, and the aggre- gate perception of business places disappeared (compared to results shown in model A). In model D, poverty continued to have a significant positive effect on crime risk perception, controlling for both official rates of violent crime and official rates of burglary. In addition, residential stability continued to have a significant negative impact on crime risk perception. Further, both vio- lent crime and burglary had significant positive effects. Overall, the addition of neighborhood contextual variables to the models did not appear to affect the individual-level variables. For models A through D in Table 3, age, sex, race, family income, safety precautions, burglary vic- timization, and violent victimization were all significant; these findings remained unchanged from those discussed for Table 2. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that there are several individual-level predictors of crime risk perception. Older, male, and non-White respondents had lower perceptions of community crime risk, as did more wealthy individuals. In addition, those who took more safety precautions and who had been victims of either burglaries or violent crimes perceived more crime risk in their local communities. Although these individual-level predictors of community 334 JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY 335 TABLE 3: Random-Coefficient Logistic Regression Models of Census Tract­Based Crime Risk Perception with Contextual Main and Mediating Effects (exponentiated coefficients in parentheses) Model A Model B Model C Model D Fixed Effect Coefficient SE Coefficient SE Coefficient SE Coefficient SE Mean risk perception ­1.313 .065 ­1.301 .062 ­1.313 .063 ­1.302 .060 *Poverty 3.453* (31.595) 1.014 2.664* (14.354) .985 2.881* (17.832) 1.005 2.172* (8.776) 1.004 *Proportion non-White 1.421* (4.141) .387 .781 (2.184) .409 .943* (2.568) .434 .522 (1.685) .446 *Residential stability ­1.826* (.161) .844 ­1.919* (.147) .799 ­1.649* (.192) .828 ­1.802* (.165) .803 *Businesses .191* (1.210) .084 .048 (1.049) .088 .201* (1.223) .081 .072 (1.075) .087 *Schools .158 (1.171) .331 .142 (1.153) .314 .164 (1.178) .321 .158 (1.171) .311 *Playgrounds .717* (2.048) .288 .463 (1.589) .280 .564* (1.758) .283 .384 (1.468) .278 *Violence rate -- -- .091* (1.095) .025 -- -- .081* (1.084) .026 *Burglary rate -- -- -- -- .058* (1.060) .021 .046* (1.047) .021 Age ­.057* (.945) .026 ­.062* (.940) .026 ­.056* (.946) .026 ­.061* (1.063) .026 Sex (male) ­.269* (.764) .076 ­.271* (.763) .077 ­.270* (.763) .076 ­.272* (.762) .077 Race (non-White) ­.576* (.562) .134 ­.591* (.554) .136 ­.577* (.562) .136 ­.593* (.553) .139 Family income ­.067* (.935) .033 ­.070* (.932) .033 ­.067* (.935) .033 ­.069* (.933) .033 Home unoccupied .012 (1.012) .020 .012 (1.012) .021 .012 (1.012) .020 .012 (1.012) .021 Dangerous activities .004 (1.004) .049 .003 (1.003) .050 .006 (1.006) .049 .005 (1.005) .050 Household goods .027 (1.027) .030 .027 (1.027) .031 .025 (1.025) .031 .026 (1.026) .031 Carried valuables .013 (1.013) .015 .012 (1.012) .015 .014 (1.014) .015 .013 (1.013) .015 Safety precautions .127* (1.135) .028 .131* (1.140) .028 .122* (1.130) .028 .126* (1.134) .029 Live alone .092 (1.096) .095 .083 (1.087) .096 .098 (1.103) .095 .087 (1.091) .096 Burglary victimization .542* (1.719) .091 .552* (1.737) .092 .543* (1.721) .091 .552* (1.737) .092 Violent victimization 1.121* (3.068) .203 1.115* (3.050) .207 1.140* (3.127) .204 1.131* (3.099) .207 (continued) 336 TABLE 3 (continued) Variance Variance Variance Variance Random Effect Component SE Component SE Component SE Component SE Mean crime risk perception, u0j .260 .057 .216 .051 .224 .053 .194 .049 Race (non-White), u3j .198 .165 .215 .171 .226 .175 .252 .185 Level 1 extra binomial error, eij .950 .020 .955 .021 .953 .021 .956 .021 NOTE: N = 4,456 individuals, 100 census tracts. * p < .05. crime risk perception are important, many of such findings have been revealed previously elsewhere (see the above review). Our focus here was on neighborhood-level factors that affect crime risk perception, particularly those related to understudied public land use. Our multilevel analyses indicate that crime risk perception indeed varied significantly across neighborhoods. We examined both social structural and land-use variables to account for this variation. Consistent with previous work, social structural characteristics, including poverty, proportion of the population that is non-White, and residential stability, had significant effects on risk perception. But we also found in initial contextual models that community-level perceptions of land uses involving businesses and play- grounds had significant effects on crime risk perception. The community- level perceived presence of schools, however, did not have an effect on crime risk perception. Although there was some reduction in mean crime risk per- ception across neighborhoods when these social structural and land-use vari- ables were included in the models, there continued to be significant variation in risk perceptions across neighborhoods in the contextual models. This sug- gests that social structural and land-use variables are only moderately suc- cessful in explaining the variation across neighborhoods. Most pertinent to our research was whether land-use variables exerted their effects on subjective perceptions of neighborhood safety net of actual or objective neighborhood crime. On the basis of previous research, we felt that neighborhood-level characteristics pertaining to the built environment might serve a heuristic function, providing cues about community crime net of the actual levels of crime. Our findings are only partially supportive of such a net effect. Community-level citizen-reported public land uses such as businesses and playgrounds do appear to have positive effects on community crime risk interpretation net of actual community rates of burglary. However, these effects are not net of community rates of violence. In the end, then, we con- clude that the general presence of public land use does not serve as a heuristic device to inform residents about the dangers of crime net of actual rates of violent crime. So what role, if any, does land use play in community crime risk interpre- tation? Although a complete answer to this question is beyond the scope of this article, we can speculate. First, our findings suggest that violent crime might mediate the effects of some public land uses, including businesses and playgrounds. Building on the early ""defensible space"" literature (Angel 1968; Jacobs 1961, 1968; Newman 1972/1973, 1996; Wood 1961), numer- ous studies have been conducted in an attempt to verify a relationship between land use and crime (for reviews, see Taylor and Gottfredson 1986; Taylor and Harrell 1996). Although the results of this research are still some- what inconclusive, there is evidence that increased crime can result from Wilcox et al. / CRIME RISK INTERPRETATION 337 proximity to nonresidential land uses such as secondary schools (Roncek and Faggiani 1985; Roncek and LoBosco 1983), bars or taverns and alcohol out- lets (Roncek and Maier 1991; Roncek and Pravatiner 1989; Speer et al. 1998), fast-food restaurants (Brantingham and Brantingham 1982), ""other"" businesses (Kurtz, Koons, and Taylor 1998), and institutional land (Ley and Cybriwsky 1974). As such, the effects of land use on risk perception may simply be indirect, through community violent crime: Public land uses increase violence, and the actual rates of violence affect perceptions of com- munity safety. In comparing the effects of public land uses with and without violence controlled, it appears as if in many cases, the cues people receive from public land uses regarding their danger are accurate. An exception to this trend in our analysis involves schools. Although schools have been shown to increase rates of violence (Roncek and Faggiani 1985; Roncek and LoBosco 1983), it is interesting in our study that the general presence of schools did not have effects on subjective community risk perception, with or without violence controlled. So the presence of businesses and the presence of playgrounds are perceived as threatening, seemingly because they are likely threatening objectively. In contrast, the presence of schools is unre- lated to perceptions of threat, despite the fact that schools do probably pose an objective threat. Overall, however, our findings provide optimism in that characteristics of the built environment do not appear to be ""scaring"" people unnecessarily. Instead, public land uses appear, for the most part, to project cues or reflect conditions related to actual, objective levels of crime. Our findings have several implications both for future research and for practical applications. Our analyses add to a growing yet still small body of literature indicating that characteristics of both individuals and neighbor- hoods affect perceptions of community crime risk. Future research address- ing crime risk perception should continue to examine both of these sets of factors. Policymakers would be well advised to do the same. That is, any pol- icy geared toward alleviating individuals' perceptions of crime risk needs to address both the individuals and the neighborhood. To ignore one in favor of the other would be remiss, and such single-level or unidimensional approaches are likely to fail in uncovering and reducing the source of crime risk perception. Although we found that crime risk perception did vary across neighborhoods, and the social structural and land-use factors measured here assisted us in explaining why crime risk perception varied, our contextual models did not account for all of the level 2 variance. Therefore, future research should examine additional contextual factors to ascertain more comprehensively why crime risk perception varies across neighborhoods. Regarding the contextual effect of public land uses specifically, although public land uses (based on aggregated citizen reports) do not affect risk net of 338 JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY violent crime, they appear to possibly play an indirect role by affecting actual community violence, which in turn affects risk perception. As such, policy efforts aimed at decreasing violent crime in public-use areas might simulta- neously decrease the perception of risk among community members. We examined several different types of publicland use, but there may be impor- tant other types worthy of exploration in future work. Whether a ""cue"" pro- vided by public land use is suggestive of low crime risk or high crime risk may depend on the specific land use in question. Although our various mea- sures of publicland use clearly represent at least two ""types"" of use, it is inter- esting that both are associated with adolescents and/or strangers--groups appearing ""risky"" to many observers. Publicland uses associated with ado- lescents and/or strangers (all of those explored here) may appear particularly risky, whereas publicland uses associated with older users and/or known res- idents of the community may seem safer. Also, public land use is only one aspect of the built environment. Other aspects, such as street layout or build- ing design, may indeed have effects on community risk perceptions net of objective community crime and should thus be examined in future work to more fully understand the role of the built environment in individuals' com- munity risk assessments. Finally, future work can elaborate on the findings revealed here by exam- ining how effects of land use on community crime risk perception might be conditional. It is plausible that the effects of neighborhood land use on risk perception might be conditional on other neighborhood-level factors, such as neighborhood crime. As such, neighborhood crime may not only mediate the effects of land use, it might also moderate such effects. For instance, the pres- ence of schools might serve to enhance risk perception in high-crime neigh- borhoods but not in low-crime neighborhoods. If such moderation occurs, then the null effects of the presence of schools found here might be better understood. The effects of neighborhood land use might also be conditional on the broader spatial context of the neighborhood (e.g., the characteristics of contiguous neighborhoods). For example, the effect of the neighborhood- level presence of businesses on risk perception might be exacerbated in com- munities surrounded by ""disadvantaged"" or high-crime neighborhoods, regardless of their own levels of disadvantage or crime. These possible condi- tional effects capture the notion of spatial autocorrelation. Although we note the importance of such ""spillover"" effects, and we recognize the presence of rather sophisticated strategies for handling these effects (see, e.g., Morenoff, Sampson, and Raudenbush 2001), we only speculate about such possible effects rather than actually testing them here, because we felt that the impor- tant first step in incorporating land use into a multilevel risk interpretation model was the estimation of main effects. However, given the findings Wilcox et al. / CRIME RISK INTERPRETATION 339 unearthed here, we encourage future researchers to make conditional effects--in terms of both intra-community-level moderating effects and spillover effects due to spatial autocorrelation--the focus of theory and mod- els of risk perception.

It should be noted that most of these studies referred to what is termed risk perception here as a fear of crime. However, Ferraro and LaGrange (1987) distinguished cognitive risk per- ception--operationalized through survey questions such as ""How safe is your neighborhood from crime?"" and ""How safe do feel to walk alone in your neighborhood at night (during the day- time)?""--as distinct from an emotionally and physiologically based fear of crime. According to Ferraro and LaGrange's typology, although traditionally viewed as measures of the fear of crime, they are better conceptualized instead as measures of the perception of risk. As such, stud- ies using these measures are referenced in our review of the risk perception literature. Although Ferraro and LaGrange were also critical of the item ""Is there any area right around here--that is, within a mile--where you would be afraid to walk alone at night?"" as a measure of fear because of its nonspecificity, they did suggest that it does touch more on fear as opposed to judgments of personal risk. As a result, studies of the fear of crime using this operationalization (see, e.g., Braungart, Braungart, and Hoyer 1980; Clemente and Kleiman 1977) are not reviewed here. Studies using other measures or scales that clearly tap emotionally based fear reactions (see e.g., Perkins and Taylor 1996; Taylor and Hale 1986) are also not reviewed here. 2. As evidence that these effects may also be conditional on race and ethnicity, Lee and Ulmer's (2000) examination of perceived incivilities, perceived risk, and the fear of crime among a Chicago sample of Korean Americans found that women experienced lower risk, and age and income were nonsignificant. 3. Chiricos et al. (1997) found that the proportion of the population that is non-White was significant for Whites only; the effect was nonsignificant for non-Whites in their sample. 340 JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY 4. Liska et al. (1982) found that official property crime rates affected risk perception for Whites only. This study also revealed that the proportion of crime that is interracial affected area- level risk perception for Whites but not for non-Whites. 5. Also, in a recent series of school crime and risk studies, researchers have shown that stu- dents perceive certain physical locations within schools to be dangerous, including hallways, bathrooms, parking lots, and cafeterias--all areas where a clear sense of ownership is lacking and surveillance is low (see, e.g., Astor and Meyer 1999; Astor, Meyer, and Behre 1999). 6. Stable census tracts were defined as those that had not changed their boundaries since 1960. 7. We note that ordinal logit is possible with hierarchical regression modeling software. However, we opted to use more traditional logistics regression procedures using a collapsed, dichotomous measure for several reasons. Most importantly, we ultimately were not interested in discerning the effects of ""feeling very unsafe,"" ""feeling somewhat unsafe,"" and ""feeling some- what safe"" from ""feeling very safe."" In line with previous work in this tradition using the same data set (e.g., Wilcox Rountree and Land 1996a, 1996b), our interest was in understanding ""feel- ings of being unsafe"" compared to ""feelings of being safe."" Further, employing ordinal logit imposes a proportional odds assumption in estimating the likelihood of experiencing one level of safety perception vis-à-vis the other levels. This proportional odds assumption may in fact be inappropriate. 8. The number of factors was not forced. 9. We want to be clear that our measures of community land uses were limited in important ways. Because they were based on perceptions, it is possible that validity problems may have arisen if respondents were not aware of or sensitive to particular land uses. Also, validity prob- lems could have ensued from differential interpretations of ""three blocks"" across the survey respondents. Despite the possible limitations, when these perceptions are averaged across the approximately 50 respondents per tract, we think that they represent reasonable measures of the ""general presence"" of various land uses within the 100 neighborhoods. 10. Caution should be used in interpreting the estimates for age and income. We recognize that because these variables were measured with ordinal scales, the most technically sound way to estimate their effects would have been to dichotomize the categories (with one reference cate- gory). However, this strategy would have more than doubled our number of explanatory vari- ables, greatly increasing the complexity of already cumbersome multilevel models. Because age and income were essentially control variables in our analysis, presenting such complexity here would seemingly detract unnecessarily from our focus--the effects of community-level land use. As such, we elected to follow precedent for analyses using the Seattle data (see, e.g., Miethe and McDowall 1993; Wilcox Rountree and Land 1996a, 1996b) and report models that treated age and income as continuous variables. However, we do note that in models (not shown here) using dummy variables for each category, age did appear to exhibit some nonlinearity. For instance, although respondents in the younger and middle age categories largely felt more risk in comparison to those in the oldest age category (and the difference lessened to nonsignificance as the age category increased), the effects of the youngest age category dummy variable repre- sented an exception to this trend. Those in the youngest age category were not significantly dif- ferent from those in the oldest age category in terms of risk perception. 11. It should be noted that the level 2 model for 3 j did not change from the previous specifi- cation, though u3 j was significant. Given that the focus of this article is to unearth direct effects of land use on risk net of actual crime, we did not estimate micro-macro interactions in attempt- ing to understand the variation in the effect of race on risk perception across neighborhoods.

106,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1001/Files (250).DOCX","The New York Times",2020-08-30,"3333 words","Section AR; Column 0; Arts and Leisure Desk; Pg. 5","By Michael Kimmelman",NA,"This Neighborhood Contains Multitudes",FALSE,"With a population of around 180,000 people speaking some 167 languages, or so locals like to point out, Jackson Heights in north-central Queens, though barely half the size of Central Park, is the most culturally diverse neighborhood in New York, if not on the planet. The brainchild of commercial real estate developers in the early years of the last century who hoped to entice white, middle-class Manhattanites seeking a suburban lifestyle a short subway ride away, Jackson Heights has become a magnet for Latinos, those who identify as L.G.B.T.Q., South Asians and just about everybody else seeking a foothold in the city and a slice of the American pie.
Suketu Mehta is a New York University professor and the author of ''Maximum City: Bombay Lost and Found'' and ''This Land Is Our Land: An Immigrant's Manifesto.'' What follows is the latest in a series of (edited, condensed) walks around the city. 
 Even by New York standards, Jackson Heights is changing so fast and contains so many different communities that no single walk can begin to take in the whole neighborhood. There's a booming Latin American cultural scene, a growing Nepali and Tibetan contingent, an urban activist movement, pioneering car bans on local streets. This is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's district, and it is represented by a longtime openly gay city councilman named Daniel Dromm. It was also one of the neighborhoods hardest hit by the Covid-19 outbreak in the spring.
 Mehta was born in Kolkata, India and raised in Mumbai. He moved with his family to Jackson Heights in 1977. His parents came to expand the family diamond business. At that time, he was 14 and, like the city, Jackson Heights was going through a rough patch.
 He and I ''met'' the other day (virtually, by phone) at Diversity Plaza, the blocklong stretch of street, pedestrianized in 2012, which has become Jackson Heights's de facto town square and a proud symbol of Queens as the city's most international borough. Half a block away, Patel Brothers, the Indian grocer, does brisk business. The plaza attracts tourists coming off the subway, looking for cheap eats, and is a meeting spot for locals, who hang out and debate politics, pick up prescriptions from the Bangladeshi pharmacy, and buy momos and samosas from the shops and food stalls that, cheek by jowl, pack both sides of the block.
 Michael Kimmelman It's almost miraculous, the effect just closing off a single street to cars has had.
 Suketu Mehta If I were Baudelaire, this is where I would do my flâneur thing. For a dollar you can get some paan and eavesdrop.
 Paan, the betel leaf.
 You'll notice all these signs around the plaza pleading with people not to spit betel juice.
 In vain, clearly.
 As in the homeland, such pleas tend to be honored more in the breach. I also want to point out a food bazaar in the plaza called Ittadi.
 Occupying a former Art Deco movie palace from the 1930s.
 It was originally called the Earle. When I was growing up, the Earle showed pornographic films. By the '80s it had turned into a Bollywood theater. The new owners didn't want to invest in a wholesale remaking of the old Earle sign, so they just changed one letter and renamed it the Eagle. You could see the G was in a totally different font. The Eagle remained popular until video stores around the corner started selling cheap pirated copies of the same films that were showing in the theater. I remember walking into one of those stores with a Bollywood director, Vidhu Vinod Chopra, with whom I had written a script. Without saying who he was, he asked for pirated copies of his own movies. When it turned out there were plenty of them for sale he started yelling at the owners, saying they were stealing his stuff.
 So they invited him for tea. They said they were so honored to have him in the store, even though he was yelling at them.
 Did they say they would stop selling pirated copies?
 Of course not. There was no way they were not going to do that. They said they were selling loads and loads of his films, that he was hugely popular, and he should consider it a compliment.
 You grew up near what's now Diversity Plaza?
 On 83rd Street and 37th Avenue, so about a 10-minute walk away and also 10 minutes from Sam and Raj. When my family and I came to America we were told that there were three monuments in New York that every Indian must visit: the Empire State Building, the Statue of Liberty and Sam and Raj, an electrical appliance shop on 74th Street and 37th Avenue, where you could buy both 110- and 220-volt appliances.
 Sam and Raj also sold toasters, razors, watches and little pens with digital alarm clocks embedded in them -- things Indians would take back home. If you spoke in Gujarati, they wouldn't charge you sales tax. Every time someone in my family came from India to visit, we had to take them to the fabled Sam and Raj. From the old country they would bring over a cargo of rich silks and exotic spices.
 And they would take back, you know, bags filled with cheap electronic knickknacks.
 Nearby I remember there was a Burmese grocery store called Mount Fuji (because the owners had lived in Japan). Big freezers contained Burmese river fish and tea leaf salads. Burmese hip-hop played on the TV. This was when Myanmar was under sanctions, so the store had to smuggle everything in from Burma. Burmese people living in Jackson Heights would make trips home and smuggle goods back. Once, I asked a couple of guys in the store what these people would take from Queens to Burma. They said the same thing: ''Centrum!''
 Apparently Centrum multivitamins were much in vogue in Burma.
 Jackson Heights was originally a private development scheme -- a kind of City Beautiful with faux French Renaissance and Tudor housing built by the Queensboro Corporation to lure white Manhattanites, but then Jews and L.G.B.T.Q. New Yorkers started arriving by the 1940s, Latinos in the '50s.
 The Queensboro Corporation named it after a descendant of one of the original Queens families and added ''heights'' because it made the place sound loftier.
 Those Latinos who started arriving in the 1950s were mostly Colombians and other South Americans. Today they're also from Central and North America. After the 1965 Immigration Act lifted restrictions on Asians, waves of Indian professionals, like my parents, started coming.
 You didn't turn out to be suited to the family trade.
 No, but I did end up writing what I believe is still the only Jain-Hasidic love story set in the diamond business. It was made into a movie some years ago by Mira Nair, part of a not particularly distinguished omnibus film called ''New York, I Love You.'' My segment was ''Kosher Vegetarian,'' starring Natalie Portman and the late, great Indian actor Irrfan Khan. Their love talk was: ''What can't you eat?''
 Speaking of cultural mash-ups, just around the corner from Diversity Plaza, if we stand at the bottom of the stairs leading to and from the elevated No. 7 train on Roosevelt at 74th and do a panoramic survey, we can find signs in Spanish, Bengali, Urdu and Hindi. The most interesting signage tends to be on the second floors.
 Facing onto the elevated subway tracks?
 Right. Those second floors are rabbit warrens of shops and offices. The multilingual signs in the windows advertise businesses that help people in the neighborhood deal with green cards, civil-service exams, driver's licenses, divorces, funerals and SAT prep. In Jackson Heights recent immigrants don't always know how to interface with the American system or whom to trust, so when they find a person, someone in one of these places, they'll often use that person to handle everything.
 Then if we walk down Roosevelt Avenue, we come to some of the famous Latino bars like ''Romanticos,'' which are what used to be called taxi dance halls.
 Henry Miller wrote about taxi dance halls in the 1920s.
 They flourish in Jackson Heights as ''bailaderos'' -- places men can go to have a beer in the presence of somewhat skimpily dressed women and pay a couple of dollars extra for a dance. Like the men, the women are mostly migrants, from all over Latin America. I've gone to these bars. Typically, a guy comes in, a woman comes up to him, she's dressed in a short skirt, they start chatting. Soon they bring out their phones to show pictures of their families back in the Dominican Republic or Mexico and coo over each other's kids before they get up to grind on the dance floor. For a few dollars, their loneliness may be briefly assuaged.
 There's an L.G.B.T.Q. bar scene on Roosevelt Avenue, as well.
 The city's biggest concentration of Latino L.G.B.T.Q. bars and nightclubs is in Jackson Heights. As far back as the 1920s, gays from Manhattan started coming to the neighborhood, and now Jackson Heights hosts the city's second-biggest Pride parade -- an amazing thing considering this is home to some of the city's most conservative religious communities, like Bangladeshi Muslims and Latino Catholics.
 I grew up among these people. My parents sent me to an all-boys Catholic school. The teachers called me a pagan and I learned to run very fast.
 There was a notorious hate crime in Jackson Heights back in 1990. Julio Rivera, a 29-year-old gay bartender, was lured to a public schoolyard, beaten and stabbed to death by skinheads.
 The corner of 78th Street and 37th Avenue is now named after Rivera. My younger sister went to that public school, P.S. 69. That this neighborhood should end up hosting the city's second-biggest Pride parade seemed impossible back then. But I think because Jackson Heights is so ethnically diverse, people have gradually become accustomed to accommodating what you might call another spice in the mix, ethnically and sexually.
 Diversity breeds tolerance.
 I don't like the word tolerance because it implies sufferance. I prefer to describe it as a lowering of people's guards at a time when the neighborhood and the city in general have become safer, which means there is less fear and more room for curiosity.
 But it's also a product of sharing the same space. I like to use the example of the building where I grew up, at 35-33 83rd Street. When I lived there -- and the situation is no different now -- the owner was Turkish. The super was Greek, the tenants were Indians and Pakistanis, Dominicans and Puerto Ricans, Muslims, Uzbeks and former Soviet Jews. People who had been killing each other just before they got on the plane for America were living next to each other. And every Sunday morning, the entire building rang to the glad sounds of Bollywood songs on ''Vision of Asia,'' which was a program broadcast on a Spanish-language television station. Dominicans, Indians, Pakistanis and Russians in the building all sang along.
 Don't get me wrong. It wasn't that we were all one big happy family and loved each other in our colorful eccentricities. We often said horribly racist things about each other.
 But we were all immigrants trying to make a life in the New World, some of us sending money back to the most hateful organizations in our home countries. But here we shared food, because Hindus and Muslims both like samosas. Here, hate crime laws, as extremists learned, were enforced much more than they were back home, so fear of the law mitigated some of the worst impulses.
 And children played together on the street, or in each other's backyards, which meant parents got to know about all these other cultures through their kids. My sister's best friend was the Greek super's daughter, which is how we learned about pork chops seasoned with oregano, and how they learned about Gujarati vegetarian food like dhoklas.
 You mentioned sending money home, the remittance economy.
 Jackson Heights is of course home to a large number of undocumented residents. There seems to be tacit understanding that civil authorities won't enforce certain rules and codes too strictly. Informality allows the system to be permeable, meaning that someone who lives here may not need to produce a Social Security card to rent an apartment or get a job. They can earn enough to pay the rent and also send money home. So along Roosevelt Avenue there are all sorts of stores that cater to the remittance economy. Last year, migrants around the world sent over $554 billion home.
 More than three times the amount of development aid dispensed by wealthy countries, according to the World Bank, although the pandemic threatens to reduce remittances significantly, with scary ripple effects on global poverty.
 Remittances may be tiny -- $50, $100 -- but the money goes directly to the grandmother for medical treatment or the sister who needs to pay her school fees. It bypasses governments and government corruption. If we really want to help the global poor, I think we need more money transfer places like the ones on Roosevelt Avenue.
 Roosevelt Avenue isn't the official commercial drag of the neighborhood.
 No, that's 37th Avenue, a block north, where you will find the ''sidewalk ballet'' that Jane Jacobs celebrated, with mom and pop stores where the mom and the pop are actually outside, standing on the street, watching kids play.
 The avenue is an incredibly lively, vibrant scene -- not messy and seedy like Roosevelt Avenue -- with everything from Korean grocers and gourmet cheese and wine shops for the yuppies who are gentrifying Jackson Heights to Brazilian and Colombian boutiques selling jeans and lingerie with fake bundas.
 Fake what?
 Bundas. Padded butts. And then you have the discount suits on display at the old-time men's wear stores, which in my day sold outfits you might recall from ''Saturday Night Fever.'' When I was a student at N.Y.U., my father took me to one. I had told him I was going on my first date. He kind of stared at me, then took me to one of these stores and very loudly announced to the salesman: ''My son has an important social occasion coming up.'' He bought me a three-piece suit.
 How lovely.
 It was highly flamboyant, with a heavy polyester component.
 How did the date go?
 She was a Dominican woman from Brooklyn. I fell madly in love. We saw a Broadway show and she somehow managed to suppress her laughter at the sight of a skinny little Indian from Jackson Heights in a three-piece polyester suit.
 You mentioned the G word earlier. Increasingly, the neighborhood has attracted young bankers and tech workers who like having the ability to choose between pupusas and parathas for dinner.
 As Amanda Burden, the city's former planning commissioner, likes to say, gentrification is like cholesterol: There's good gentrification and bad gentrification. For Jackson Heights, it's a good thing that there is diversity of income as well as of ethnicity. But big garden apartments that used to sell for $300,000 now cost closer to $1 million, which has had the effect of forcing more and more immigrants into basement apartments.
 We'll get to the basement apartments. The garden apartments first. You're talking about ones the Queensboro Corporation built to entice middle-class Manhattanites.
 Right -- places like the Chateau on 81st Street. My younger sister's best friend lived there. It's in what is now the neighborhood's designated historic district, which includes some of the loveliest housing in all five boroughs, constructed mostly between the 1910s and the 1950s. The buildings have pretty slate roofs and all kinds of architectural details, with blocklong interior gardens that you can't see from the street, which was the point. They're private gardens. At the Chateau, the garden was designed by the Olmsted brothers, I believe.
 And gentrification is producing new developments like Roosevelt Parc.
 A residential tower, around the corner from Diversity Plaza, by Marvel Architects.
 With rooftop lounges, a movie room and a yoga lawn that rent for thousands of dollars a month. In Jackson Heights, the issue around gentrification isn't just the rent. It's the fact that a potential tenant at a place like Roosevelt Parc needs to produce all kinds of documents to apply for an apartment. That kind of documentation, even if you're legal, can be very difficult for new immigrants who haven't built up credit histories or developed references.
 So rising rents and other obstacles push more people into basement apartments.
 Yes. The garden apartments are on the north side of 37th Avenue. We can see basement apartments on the south side. These are mostly pleasant, suburban-looking streets with neat two-story frame houses -- you wouldn't know that dozens of people live in the basements unless you notice the number of mailboxes and satellite dishes. Sometimes you can guess who lives there. I don't know why but Trinidadians and Guyanese seem to prefer white steel gates.
 Inside, the rooms are all occupied by different people, and the basement might have hot beds, meaning cubicles where people share the same bed in shifts. I've been in many of these basements. There's a perception they're fire traps, and some are, but usually, with just a few fixes, they could be brought up to code.
 The city certainly needs more affordable housing. But even if landlords spent the money to upgrade them, New York, unlike, say, San Francisco or Seattle or Los Angeles, doesn't seem anxious to legalize lots more ''alternative dwellings,'' as they're called.
 The city has fallen behind the curve. I think landlords would spend the money. Most of the landlords are immigrants themselves who would have a much easier time getting mortgages if they were able to show that the rents from these basements were legitimate income.
 How do you think the pandemic will change things?
 It's an open question whether gentrifiers will continue moving into the neighborhood or whether they'll now prefer to leave the city for places like Hudson, N.Y. But the taxi drivers and delivery guys who share the basement cubicles don't have the luxury of teleworking. So they're not going anywhere.
 And where are we going next?
 A block from The Chateau, I wanted to point out Community United Methodist Church. There's a street sign at the corner commemorating the invention of Scrabble, which was first played in the church in 1938. It was the invention of a Jackson Heights resident (an unemployed architect) named Alfred Butts. Legions of Scrabble devotees now make pilgrimages to the church, which you will notice also advertises services in Punjabi, Urdu, Bahasa, Korean, Chinese and Spanish. I love that God is worshiped in so many languages in the house where Scrabble was invented. Brooklyn may be known as the Borough of Churches. But Jackson Heights is where, for example, the Jewish Center, on 77th Street, also hosts Pentecostal services, Hindu services and the annual Iftar celebration of Bangladeshi and other Muslims.
 That's rather beautiful.
 Look, architecturally speaking, the neighborhood is not Versailles. There are some really unlovely buildings and shabby dwellings in Jackson Heights. But, for me, the area comes down to its people and their stories --- and to the surprise and joy you feel walking down a street like 37th Avenue and seeing all the Bangladeshi and Dominican knickknack shops and children's toys spilling onto the sidewalk, and the people selling sugar cane juice. The neighborhood is an incredibly hospitable place, where a person can come from anywhere, doesn't necessarily need papers, might have to start at the bottom -- literally, in the basement -- but can gain a foothold in America.
 The American dream.
 Speaking of which, I thought we might end at a wonderful ice cream store, founded in 1897, Jahn's, which I used to go to with my family. The signature dish is the Kitchen Sink Sundae for eight.
 I've seen a video of that sundae on YouTube. It's the size of a punch bowl. Is that what your family ordered?
 Of course, not long after we arrived. And that's when we realized: This is the promise of the New World. We have found it. It's the Kitchen Sink Sundae for eight.

PORTAGE, Michigan (AP) — The first of many freezer-packed COVID-19 vaccine vials made their way to distribution sites across the United States on Sunday, as the nation's pandemic deaths approached the horrifying new milestone of 300,000.
The rollout of the Pfizer vaccine, the first to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration, ushers in the biggest vaccination effort in U.S. history — one that health officials hope the American public will embrace, even as some have voiced initial skepticism or worry. Shots are expected to be given to health care workers and nursing home residents beginning Monday.
Quick transport is key for the vaccine, especially since this one must be stored at extremely low temperatures — about 94 degrees below zero. Early Sunday, workers at Pfizer — dressed in fluorescent yellow clothing, hard hats and gloves — wasted no time as they packed vials into boxes. They scanned the packages and then placed them into freezer cases with dry ice. The vaccines were then taken from Pfizer's Portage, Michigan, facility to Gerald R. Ford International Airport in Grand Rapids, where the first cargo plane took off amid what airport officials called a “jubilant” mood.
“This is a historic day,” said Richard W. Smith, who oversees operations in the Americas for FedEx Express, which is delivering 630-some packages of vaccine to distribution sites across the country. United Parcel Service also is transporting a share of the vaccine.
Helping with the transport of the vaccine has special meaning to Bruce Smith, a FedEx package handler at the Grand Rapids airport, whose older sister, Queen, died after she contracted the coronavirus in May. She was hospitalized in Georgia one day after he saw her on a video chat, and they never spoke again.

US agencies hacked in monthslong global cyberspying campaign
WASHINGTON (AP) — Hackers broke into the networks of the Treasury and Commerce departments as part of a monthslong global cyberespionage campaign revealed Sunday, just days after the prominent cybersecurity firm FireEye said it had been breached in an attack that industry experts said bore the hallmarks of Russian tradecraft.
The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security's cybersecurity arm were investigating what experts and former officials said appeared to be a large-scale penetration of U.S. government agencies — apparently the same cyberespionage campaign that also afflicted FireEye, foreign governments and major corporations.
“This can turn into one of the most impactful espionage campaigns on record,"" said cybersecurity expert Dmitri Alperovitch.
The hacks were revealed less than a week after FireEye disclosed that foreign government hackers had broken into its network and stolen the company's own hacking tools, first reported by Reuters. Many experts suspect Russia is responsible. FireEye’s customers include federal, state and local governments and top global corporations.
The apparent conduit for the Treasury and Commerce Department hacks — and the FireEye compromise — is a hugely popular piece of server software called SolarWinds. It is used by hundreds of thousands of organizations globally, including most Fortune 500 companies and multiple U.S. federal agencies that will now be scrambling to patch up their networks, said Alperovitch, the former chief technical officer of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike.

Trump appoints flurry of allies as presidency winds down
WASHINGTON (AP) — His time in the White House rapidly ending, President Donald Trump is rewarding some supporters and like-minded allies with the perks and prestige that come with serving on federal advisory boards and commissions.
On Thursday, Trump announced his intention to nominate two authors who wrote books that flattered him to a board that makes recommendations on education research. Another author who helped write a favourable book about the president was chosen for the same board a few days earlier.
On Wednesday, the Department of Defence announced that China hawk Michael Pillsbury would become the chair of a board that gives Pentagon leadership advice on how to enhance national security. Pillsbury has served as an outside adviser to the president on China.
And on Tuesday, Trump said he would appoint his former counsellor and 2016 campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, to serve on the board of visitors to the U.S. Air Force Academy. Going to the same board will be Heidi Stirrup, an ally of top Trump adviser Stephen Miller. She served as a White House liaison at the Justice Department and was told to vacate the building when top department officials learned of her efforts to collect inside information about ongoing cases and the department’s work on election fraud.
Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao was among the appointees to the board of trustees at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. She’s also married to Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.

Gunman shot by police at NYC cathedral Christmas concert
NEW YORK (AP) — A man was fatally shot by police on the steps of a landmark New York City cathedral Sunday after he began firing two semiautomatic handguns at the end of a Christmas choral concert, police said.
The gunfire began just before 4 p.m. at the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine, mother church of the Episcopal Diocese of New York.
A 45-minute concert held on the cathedral steps had just concluded and a crowd of several hundred people was drifting away when the gunman started shooting, sending people running down Amsterdam Avenue screaming and diving to the sidewalk.
A detective, a sergeant and a police officer who were at the event fired 15 rounds, killing the man, said New York Police Commissioner Dermot Shea.
“It is by the grace of God today,” he said, that no one besides the gunman was struck.

Report: Cleveland Indians changing name after 105 years
CLEVELAND (AP) — The Cleveland Indians are changing their name after 105 years.
Citing three people familiar with the decision, The New York Times reported Sunday night that the team is moving away from a name considered racist for decades. The Indians have been internally discussing a potential name change for months.
A team spokesman told The Associated Press the franchise has no immediate comment on the report.
The Times said the team could make a formal announcement later this week. It's not known when the name change will take affect or if the team has settled on a new moniker.
Cleveland's move away from Indians follows a similar decision earlier this year by the NFL's Washington Football Team, which was previously known as the Redskins.

John le Carre, who probed murky world of spies, dies at 89
LONDON (AP) — John le Carre, the spy-turned-novelist whose elegant and intricate narratives defined the Cold War espionage thriller and brought acclaim to a genre critics had once ignored, has died. He was 89.
Le Carre’s literary agency, Curtis Brown, said Sunday he died in Cornwall, southwest England on Saturday after a short illness. The agency said his death was not related to COVID-19. His family said he died of pneumonia
In classics such as “The Spy Who Came in from the Cold,” “Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy” and “The Honourable Schoolboy,” Le Carre combined terse but lyrical prose with the kind of complexity expected in literary fiction. His books grappled with betrayal, moral compromise and the psychological toll of a secret life. In the quiet, watchful spymaster George Smiley, he created one of 20th-century fiction’s iconic characters — a decent man at the heart of a web of deceit.
“John le Carre has passed at the age of 89. This terrible year has claimed a literary giant and a humanitarian spirit,"" tweeted novelist Stephen King. Margaret Atwood said: “Very sorry to hear this. His Smiley novels are key to understanding the mid-20th century.”
For le Carre, the world of espionage was a “metaphor for the human condition.”

White House, other top officials to get early vaccine access
WASHINGTON (AP) — Senior U.S. government officials, including some White House officials who work in close proximity to President Donald Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence, will be offered coronavirus vaccines as soon as this week, while its public distribution is limited to front-line health workers and people in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.
Doses of the newly approved vaccine from Pfizer will be made available to those who work in close quarters with the nation's top leaders, two people familiar with the matter confirmed. They said the move was meant to prevent more COVID-19 spread in the White House, which has already suffered from several outbreaks of the virus that infected Trump and other top officials, and other critical facilities.
It was not immediately clear how many officials would be offered the vaccine initially and whether Trump or Pence would get it.
The Trump administration is undertaking the vaccination program under federal continuity of government plans, officials said.
“Senior officials across all three branches of government will receive vaccinations pursuant to continuity of government protocols established in executive policy,” said National Security Council spokesperson John Ulyot. “The American people should have confidence that they are receiving the same safe and effective vaccine as senior officials of the United States government on the advice of public health professionals and national security leadership.”

Trump raises China concerns as reason to veto defence bill
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump offered a new rationale Sunday for threatening to veto the annual defence policy bill that covers the military's budget for equipment and pay raises for service members: China. He did not outline his concerns.
Republican and Democratic lawmakers say the wide-ranging defence policy bill, which the Senate sent to the president on Friday, would be tough on China and must become law as soon as possible.
Both the House and Senate passed the measure by margins large enough to override a potential veto from the president, who has a history of failing to carry out actions he has threatened.
“The biggest winner of our new defence bill is China! I will veto!” Trump said in a new tweet.
The White House did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on Trump’s specific concerns about China.

Vandals hit Black churches during weekend pro-Trump rallies
WASHINGTON (AP) — Vandals tore down a Black Lives Matter banner and sign from two historic Black churches in downtown Washington and set the banner ablaze as nighttime clashes Saturday between pro-Donald Trump supporters and counterdemonstrators erupted into violence and arrests.
Police on Sunday said they were investigating the incidents at the Asbury United Methodist Church and Metropolitan A.M.E. Church as potential hate crimes, which one religious leader likened to a cross burning.
“This weekend, we saw forces of hate seeking to use destruction and intimidation to tear us apart,” District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser said Sunday. “We will not let that happen.”
A video posted on Twitter showed a group of men appearing to take down a BLM sign at the Metropolitan A.M.E. Church as others in the crowd shout, “Whose streets? Our streets.” Another video showed people pouring an accelerant on a BLM banner and setting it ablaze in the street as others cheered and cursed antifa. Someone walks up about a minute later and uses a fire extinguisher to put out the flames.
“It pained me especially to see our name, Asbury, in flames,"" the Rev. Dr. Ianther M. Mills, the senior pastor at Asbury church said in a statement Sunday. “For me it was reminiscent of cross burnings. Seeing this act on video made me both indignant and determined to fight the evil that has reared its ugly head.”

Artists, activists rush to save Black Lives Matter murals
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Neither woman could bring themselves to watch the video of George Floyd’s final moments, his neck pinned under a Minneapolis police officer’s knee.
But as their city grieved, Leesa Kelly and Kenda Zellner-Smith found much-needed comfort in the messages of anguish and hope that appeared on boarded-up windows as residents turned miles of plywood into canvases. Now, they’re working to save those murals before they vanish.
“These walls speak,” said Zellner-Smith, who said she was too numb to cry after Floyd’s killing. “They’re the expressions of communities. We want these feelings, hopes, calls to action to live on.”
Together, the two Black women formed Save the Boards to Memorialize the Movement, part of a push to preserve the ephemeral expressions of anger and pain born of outrage over racial injustice that triggered weeks of protests across the country.
Some artists began painting intricate murals, but many spray-painted raw messages of anguish. Zellner-Smith started with the simple pieces."

Together, the two Black women formed Save the Boards to Memorialize the Movement, part of a push to preserve the ephemeral expressions of anger and pain born of outrage over racial injustice that triggered weeks of protests across the country.
Some artists began painting intricate murals, but many spray-painted raw messages of anguish. Zellner-Smith started with the simple pieces."

June is Pride month. Traditionally Pride is a time when the 2SLGBTQ+ community and allies come together in the spirit of freedom, expression, individuality and diversity; unfortunately, this year’s festival is one of the many community gatherings left in the wake of COVID-19.
Pride is many things to many people, but one thing is for sure: It doesn’t begin and end in a month.
To the author, Pride is solidarity and activism continually fighting for equal human rights of those who are marginalized, oppressed or treated unfairly as a result of ignorance.
Pride is welcoming for those who have struggled to find acceptance, but can now relish in self-realization and self-respect.
Pride is remembrance of so many who have lost their lives as a result of hate crimes, HIV and AIDS, or those who have died by suicide after succumbing to societal pressures, bullying and harassment.
The timing of Pride month is rich with history. This year, June 28 will mark 50 years since the first Pride marches were organized in New York and other U.S cities to commemorate the Stonewall riots that had occurred the year before.
According to Encyclopaedia Britannica the riots, also known as the Stonewall uprising, were a “spontaneous protest against the perpetual police harassment and social discrimination suffered by a variety of sexual minorities in the 1960s.”
Today, as global protests press on in response to systemic racial issues, Pride’s significance has never been more relevant. Many Pride organizers are celebrating virtually and helping to amplify voices of Black Lives Matter, recognizing that the riots at Stonewall were led by two women of colour.
While the events that occurred in June, 1969 were not the first of the gay rights movement, they were a significant catalyst to the organization of activist groups across the United States, Canada and around the world, with Pride marches seeing strong community support and participation grow year over year.
Pride Winnipeg’s first recognized march, consisting of 250 people, took place on August 2, 1987 when the Manitoba Government voted to include sexual orientation in the Manitoba Human Rights code. Documented marches did however occur for years prior.
Last year, on the 50th anniversary of Stonewall, Winnipeg’s Pride march and festival saw more than 30,000 2SLGBTQ+ community members and allies come together in solidarity to celebrate.
The University of Manitoba was in attendance in full force and has been an active, gold-level sponsor of Pride Winnipeg for the past four years.
UM is proud of its diverse community and support of Pride Winnipeg’s annual celebrations and I am proud to be a 2SLGBTQ+ employee of such an organization.
To commemorate Pride this year, the Pride flag will fly over the UM Fort Garry campus from June until Pride Winnipeg’s virtual celebration in September. Details of other UM virtual events to come."

Thank you, Savannah. Craig joins the table now, new developments in the Ahmaud Arbery case.
CRAIG MELVIN (07:12:21): Indeed. Hoda, good morning. And good morning to you as well. The three suspects in the Arbery shooting death have now been indicted on felony murder charges. NBC`s Blayne Alexander has been following the story from the very beginning. She`s in Atlanta this morning. Blayne, good morning to you.
BLAYNE ALEXANDER (07:12:36): Well, Craig, good morning to you. The death of Ahmaud Arbery is one of several high-profile, racially charged cases that have sparked protests all around the country. Now, Ahmaud`s mother tells me that she believes this is a significant step forward, but the attorneys for the men who have been charged are warning against what they call a rush to judgment.
(Begin VT)
BLAYNE ALEXANDER (07:12:57): The decision came after just ten minutes of deliberation. A Georgia grand jury indicting three white men on murder charges for the death of Ahmaud Arbery, who was black.
JOYETTE HOLMES (Cobb County District Attorney) (07:13:06): This is another positive step, another great step for finding justice for Ahmaud.
BLAYNE ALEXANDER (07:13:12): The charges include felony murder, aggregated assault and false imprisonment for Gregory and Travis McMichael, and their neighbor, William Roddie Bryan, who recorded this video of Arbery`s final moments. For Arbery`s mother, the indictment is an encouraging step.
WANDA COOPER-JONES (07:13:27): This just empowers the fight. I mean, this is just the first steps of it. We still have a long way to go.
BLAYNE ALEXANDER (07:13:34): Arbery was unarmed and out for a jog, his family says, when he was pursued by the McMichaels in a pickup truck. Gregory McMichael told police he and son, Travis, followed Arbery because they thought he was a burglary suspect and that Travis fired his shotgun when Arbery began to violently attack him. In a statement, a lawyer for Travis McMichael said his client will plead not guilty, adding, ""We look forward to presenting all of the facts regarding this tragic death in a court of law."" Attorneys for Gregory McMichael have called him a good person and warned against a rush to judgment. Bryan`s lawyer, Kevin Gough, urged the DA to consider bond.
KEVIN GOUGH (07:14:10): We welcome the action of the grand jury today. While we disagree with it, it`s an important step in the process to moving this case closer to the speedy trial that Roddie has demanded.
BLAYNE ALEXANDER (07:14:22): How significant is this step?
LEE MERRITT (Attorney for Ahmaud Arbery`s Family) (07:14:24): Oh, it`s a huge step. We often see arrests without any follow-through, without actual indictments on the appropriate charges here. We believe the appropriate charges were found.
BLAYNE ALEXANDER (07:14:34): The indictment comes just hours after Georgia lawmakers passed a bill enforcing stiffer punishments for hate crimes. Previously, one of only four states without such a law. Lawmakers say Arbery`s death finally helped push the bill through. For his mother, it`s all motivation to moving forward. WANDA COOPER-JONES (07:14:52): Yesterday, I learned about the hate crime bill being passed. And today, I learned about the indictment. So I`m very pleased. At this point, I do believe the case is moving in the right direction.
(End VT)
BLAYNE ALEXANDER (07:15:01): Now, the governor has indicated that he will sign that bill. But the DA says that it will not apply in this case because those indictments have already been handed down. Meanwhile, the mother of Ahmaud Arbery is headed to Kentucky this morning. She`s meeting with Breonna Taylor`s mother. That`s the twenty-six-year-old EMT who was shot and killed by police in her own home. The two mothers will join a rally this morning, calling for those three officers to face charges. Craig.
CRAIG MELVIN (07:15:25): All right, Blayne Alexander for us there in Atlanta. Blayne, thank you.
HODA KOTB (07:15:28): We do have a lot more to get to this morning, including NASA renaming its headquarters in Washington, DC, after Mary W. Jackson, the agency`s first African-American female engineer. Jackson, who died back in 2005, was among the significant figures in NASA history, was instrumental in getting American astronauts into space. She, by the way, helped inspire the book and film, Hidden Figures, which was nominated for several Oscars. Jackson`s daughter, Carolyn Lewis, said in a statement, ""She was a scientist, humanitarian, wife, mother, trailblazer who paved the way for thousands of others to succeed not only at NASA but throughout this nation."" And that-- the movie, Hidden Figures, kind of opened that story up to a lot of folks.

Then, the troubles of a nation in turmoil landed on Hall's doorstep in suburban Detroit in September when racist graffiti was scrawled on his pickup truck and shots were fired into his home after his family placed a Black Lives Matter sign in their front window.
""I'm in combat mode. I'm protecting my family,"" Hall, a 52-year-old Black man from Warren, told The Associated Press.
Some experts say police brutality, the coronavirus pandemic that has taken disproportionate physical and financial tolls on Black people, and other issues around race have increased anxiety levels among African Americans, like Hall.
The attacks on Hall's home were investigated as a hate crime and 24-year-old white neighbour, Michael Frederick Jr., eventually was arrested and charged with ethnic intimidation and other crimes.
""We, as Black people, have all of the normal human stressors - work, family, finances - and then we're inundated with racial pressure at all levels,"" said Jessica Graham-Lopresti, assistant professor of psychology at Suffolk University and co-founder of Massachusetts-based BARE - Black Advocacy Resilience Empowerment.
""This idea that, for Black people, we don't feel - currently in this country - that we have the ability to control our environment and protect ourselves and our families,"" she said. ""We could still be gunned down in the street. That creates anxiety. That creates stress.""
In May, mostly white men and women protesting Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's orders that closed many businesses and services to stem the spread of COVID-19 openly carried rifles and handguns into the state capitol.
As many activists take to the streets to maintain public political pressure for change, concern about personal safety is at an all-time high, said Frederick Gooding Jr., an African American studies professor at Texas Christian University.
""Especially in the aftermath of Kyle Rittenhouse walking untouched in full view with an assault rifle AFTER shooting another civilian dead,"" Gooding added.
Rittenhouse, a white 17-year-old from northern Illinois, is accused of fatally shooting two white protesters and wounding a third in August in Kenosha, Wisconsin, during demonstrations following the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man. Rittenhouse was among a number of armed white men who converged on the city, claiming they were protecting property from arson and theft.
After the gunfire, with his AR-15-style rifle over his shoulder and his hands in the air, Rittenhouse walked toward police vehicles that kept going past him, even as a witness shouted, ""He just shot them!"" Police Chief Daniel Miskinis has explained the response as officers dealing with a chaotic scene.
Sharon Bethune, 56, of Fredericksburg, Virginia, said the events in Kenosha angered her and other Black people.
""This is mind-boggling,"" said Bethune, a retiree who managed government accounts for the Environmental Protection Agency. ""I've never seen anything like this.""
For Black professionals and those in the middle class, the anxiety appears to be more pronounced, said Alford Young Jr., a sociology professor at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.
They wonder ""how we got to this moment of national leadership after the civil rights movement,"" Young said. ""There is just extreme anxiety and frustration that people would not have imagined that the kinds of issues surfacing now would have followed an Obama presidency.""
Many working class Black people see the current political landscape with less dread and more ""the way it's always been,"" he added.
Candace Hall, Eddie Hall's wife, said Republican President Donald Trump shoulders part of the blame for how many African Americans are feeling.
Trump, who claims to have done more for Black people than his predecessors, has been accused of using race to stoke division. He has encouraged police to use a heavy-handed approach on people protesting against racism and police brutality. During his first debate with Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, Trump refused to condemn white supremacy.
""He's opened up Pandora's box with racism and anger and telling police to beat people up,"" said Candace Hall, 55, also an Army veteran.
Ciaran O'Connor, spokesman for New York-based Braver Angels, which seeks to depolarize American politics, said people need to talk to each other, not retreat from tough conversations, as they fight for what they believe in.
""We believe in the power of conversation if you are trying to persuade people in a way to humanize people,"" O'Connor said. ""If we're gonna bring positive change, we're going to have to find ways to have these conversations."""

Now, with four months until the U.S. presidential election and the country's divisions reaching a boiling point, these companies are upping their game against bigotry and threats of violence.
What's not yet clear is whether this action is too little, too late - nor whether the pressure on these companies, including a growing advertiser boycott, will be enough to produce lasting change.
Reddit, an online comment forum that is one of the world's most popular websites, on Monday banned a forum that supported President-Donald Trump as part of a crackdown on hate speech. Also on Monday, live-streaming site Twitch, which is owned by Amazon, temporarily suspended Trump's campaign account for violating its hateful conduct rules.
YouTube, meanwhile, banned several prominent white nationalist figures from its platform, including Stefan Molyneux, David Duke and Richard Spencer.
Social media companies, led by Facebook, now face a reckoning over what critics call indefensible excuses for amplifying divisions, hate and misinformation on their platforms. Civil rights groups have called on large advertisers to stop Facebook ad campaigns during July, saying the social network isn't doing enough to curtail racist and violent content on its platform.
Companies such as the consumer goods giant Unilever - one of the world's largest advertisers - as well as Verizon, Ford and many smaller brands have joined the boycott, some for the month of July and others for the rest of the year. New companies have been signing on to the boycott almost every day. While some are pausing ads only on Facebook, others have also stepped back from advertising on Twitter and other platforms.
On Monday, Ford Motor Co. put the brakes on all national social media advertising for the next 30 days. The company says hate speech, as well as posts advocating violence and racial injustice, need to be eradicated from the sites.
While the ad boycott has dinged Facebook's and Twitter's shares, analysts who follow the social media business don't see it as having a lasting effect.
Raymond James analyst Aaron Kessler noted that YouTube has faced several ad boycotts in the past over hate speech and other objectionable material. Each time, it adjusted its policies and the advertisers returned. In addition, July is generally a slow month for advertising. Companies have also been cutting their ad budgets due to COVID-19, so the spending declines are not a surprise for investors. Kessler called Facebook's stock pullback - its shares fell more than 8% on Friday, then rallied a bit Monday - a ""buying opportunity.""
Reddit's action was part of a larger purge at the San Francisco-based site. The company said it took down a total of 2,000 forums, known as the site as ""subreddits,"" most of which it said were inactive or had few users.
The Trump Reddit forum, called The_Donald, was banned because it encouraged violence, regularly broke other Reddit rules, and defiantly ""antagonized"" both Reddit and other forums, the company said in a statement. Reddit had previously tried to discipline the forum.
""We are cautiously optimistic that Reddit is finally working with groups like ours to dismantle the systems that enable hateful rhetoric on their platform,"" Bridget Todd, a spokeswoman for the women's advocacy organization UltraViolet, said in an emailed statement.
The group said its members met with Reddit CEO Steve Huffman via Zoom last week, encouraging him to address racism and hate speech on the platform.
Despite optimism from some critics, others said it is not clear if such measures will be enough. For years, racist groups ""have successfully used social media to amplify their message and gain new recruits,"" said Sophie Bjork-James an anthropology professor at Vanderbilt University who specializes in white nationalism, racism and hate crimes.
""However, limiting access to a broader public will have unintended negative consequences. Far-right and white nationalist groups are increasingly gathering on encrypted apps and social media sites that do not monitor for offensive speech or violent content,"" she added. ""This shift allows for co-ordinating more violent and radical actions.""
The algorithms tech companies developed to keep users glued to their services ""have provided perhaps the biggest boon to organized racism in decades, as they help racist ideas find a much larger and potentially receptive audience,"" Bjork-James said, adding that she is hopeful that the same companies that ""helped this anti-democratic movement expand"" can now help limit its impact.
For its part, Twitch pointed to comments the president made at two rallies, videos of which were posted on the site.
In one, a livestream of a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Trump talked about a ""very tough hombre"" breaking into someone's home. The other was from a 2015 campaign rally that was recently posted on Twitch, in which Trump said Mexico sends rapists and criminals to the U.S. Twitch declined to say how long the suspension will last.
The White House referred a request for comment to Trump's reelection campaign. Tim Murtaugh, the campaign's director of communications, said that people who want to hear directly from the president should download the campaign's app.
Reddit has tweaked its rules and banned forums for white nationalists over the years in an attempt to rid its platform of vitriol, sometimes producing significant user backlash as a result.
CEO Steve Huffman said earlier this month that Reddit was working with moderators to explicitly address hate speech.

But Wild Mountain Thyme, a new Hollywood film starring Jamie Dornan and Emily Blunt, has been ridiculed for the stars' doomed attempt at Irish accents, and for perpetuating national stereotypes. At one point, Dornan's character proposes to a donkey.
If a sign were needed that the film had overdone the Irish clichés, the National Leprechaun Museum in Dublin was moved to tweet: ""Even we think this is a bit much.""
The release of the trailer on social media was greeted with hilarity by the Irish, and bafflement that Dornan's accent is so bad when he was born in Co Down, Northern Ireland.
""These accents constitute a hate crime,"" said one viewer. And another wrote: ""They're lucky this came out the week of voting Biden in, or else it could cause an international incident.""
The Twitter account for Dublin Airport also joined in, posting: ""There's fashion police. Grammar police. We even have airport police. Is there such a thing as accent police? If so, somebody better call 'em."" A feature about the film in the Irish Times was headlined: ""What in the name of holy bejaysus is this cowpat?""
Even the Irish Embassy in Washington DC decided to comment, tweeting: ""To be fair, Irish accents are hard (we struggle with them at times). But otherwise Wild Mountain Thyme looks great. And, in Jamie Dornan and Emily Blunt, presents a remarkably realistic depiction, visually at least, of the average Irish man and woman. Truly, we are a beautiful people.""
Blunt and Dornan star as Rosemary
Muldoon and Anthony Reilly, who grow up on neighbouring farms in the bucolic Irish countryside.
Rosemary secretly loves Anthony but he is oblivious to her feelings. She has her head turned by Anthony's American cousin, played by Jon Hamm, the only character wisely retaining his own accent. Anthony's father is played by Christopher Walken.
The film is directed by John Patrick Shanley, who was Oscar-nominated in 2008 for Doubt and whose writing credits include the 1980s hit Moonstruck.
It is based on his own play Outside Mullingar, which had its Broadway debut in 2014. When Wild Mountain Thyme was announced earlier this year,
Blunt called it ""undeniably the most beautifully written script I read in a long time"".
The British actress, who lives in New York, said she and Dornan were both terrified at the prospect of mastering the Irish accent.
In a joint interview with People magazine, Dornan said: ""I'm actually from about 120 miles where the movie is set, and Emily, there's an ocean between her and where the movie is set. Or the Irish Sea, certainly. So it was definitely easier for me, but she's amazing.""
Blunt said she had found it tougher than Dornan had, ""but he assured me that I sounded Irish and I'm going to believe him. So if he's wrong, I'm going to blame him for any backlash on my accent. He has assured me it was a great Irish accent"".
The film is due for release in the US next month. A UK date has not been set.
Blarney bad show Actors who came across as eejits u Tom Cruise in Far and Away (1992) The Irish Times called his performance as a tenant farmer who sets off for a new life in America ""the benchmark by which all bad Irish accents are measured"".
u Sean Connery in The Untouchables (1987) Empire voted this the worst accent in film history, ahead of Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins, as the Scot attempted to sound like a Chicago-Irish cop.
u Pierce Brosnan in Taffin (1988) Brosnan was actually born in Drogheda, but his accent in this low-budget drama is regarded as one of the worst ever on film.

Social media companies, led by Facebook, now face a reckoning over what critics call indefensible excuses for amplifying divisions, hate and misinformation on their platforms. Civil rights groups have called on large advertisers to stop Facebook ad campaigns during July, saying the social network isn’t doing enough to curtail racist and violent content on its platform.
Companies such as the consumer goods giant Unilever — one of the world's largest advertisers — as well as Verizon, Ford and many smaller brands have joined the boycott, some for the month of July and others for the rest of the year. New companies have been signing on to the boycott almost every day. While some are pausing ads only on Facebook, others have also stepped back from advertising on Twitter and other platforms.

Kessler called Facebook's stock pullback — its shares fell more than 8% on Friday, then rallied a bit Monday — a “buying opportunity.”
Reddit's action was part of a larger purge at the San Francisco-based site. The company said it took down a total of 2,000 forums, known as the site as “subreddits,” most of which it said were inactive or had few users.
The Trump Reddit forum, called The_Donald, was banned because it encouraged violence, regularly broke other Reddit rules, and defiantly “antagonized” both Reddit and other forums, the company said in a statement. Reddit had previously tried to discipline the forum.
“We are cautiously optimistic that Reddit is finally working with groups like ours to dismantle the systems that enable hateful rhetoric on their platform,"" Bridget Todd, a spokeswoman for the women's advocacy organization UltraViolet, said in an emailed statement.

LONDON — The police in Birmingham, England, arrested a man on Monday and charged him with stabbing eight people, killing one, in a series of apparently random attacks in the city early Sunday.
The suspect, a 27-year-old man whose name was not immediately released, was charged with murder and seven counts of attempted murder. He was detained in the Selly Oak neighborhood in southwest Birmingham around 4 a.m. local time, the police said.
A 23-year-old man died in the attacks on Sunday, and two other victims, aged 19 and 32, were in critical condition at a hospital on Monday, the police said. Five other victims, aged 23 to 33, sustained less serious injuries.
The police said they were unable to discern a pattern in the attacks, leading them to believe that the victims had been chosen at random. Steve Graham, chief superintendent of the West Midlands Police, said on Sunday that there was no indication the attacks were related to terrorism or gang violence, nor that they were a hate crime.
Starting in the early hours of Sunday, the assaults spanned the center of the city, which is about 120 miles northwest of London, lasted at least 90 minutes and ended in a bustling nightlife area. Witnesses said that an attacker wearing a hooded top had approached the victims without warning, and eluded bystanders’ attempts to capture him.
“It happened very quickly,” one witness, Savvas Sfrantziz, a bar owner in the nightlife area, told Sky News, describing one of the attacks. “He just went up to her and just stabbed her. I’ve never seen anything like it.”
Officers sifted through surveillance camera footage and asked for photographs and videos from the public to help in the search. One tip led them to an address in Selly Oak, where the arrest was made. 
In a statement released on Monday, the police said the arrest was “a crucial development,” but underlined that the investigation was continuing. “We still need to speak to any witnesses who saw what happened who’ve not yet spoken to us, or anyone who may have video footage or photos of the incidents or the attacker,” the statement added.
The mayor of Birmingham, Andy Street, said in a post on Twitter that the attacks were a “one-off tragedy.”
“But the message must be it is utterly uncharacteristic of Birmingham,” he added. “The thing that is characteristic will be seen to be a defiant response where all communities come together to condemn it and prove that we can continue all to live together in harmony.”
Knife crime in England and Wales has been on the rise for several years and reached a record annual high for the year ending March 2020, according to a government report. The police recorded 46,265 offenses involving knives or sharp instruments in that period, an increase of 6 percent over the previous 12 months. According to the Office for National Statistics, 256 people died in such attacks in England and Wales in the year up to March 2020.
Apart from the killing in Birmingham, there have been other fatal knife attacks in Britain in recent months. Three people were killed in June in a stabbing at a park in Reading, England, that the police described as terrorism. In July, there were three deadly stabbings and two fatal shootings in London in the space of a week.

McCray, had called to report that five white people were threatening him and taunting him with racial slurs at an apartment complex he owns. He ended up in custody.
A Virginia sheriff has apologized to a black pastor who was arrested earlier this month after he called 911 to report that a group of white people were trespassing on his property and taunting him with racial slurs. 
 The pastor, Leon K. McCray, 61, called the authorities during the confrontation, which began when he saw two people hauling a refrigerator to the dumpsters at the apartment building he owns in Edinburg, Va., on June 1.
 Mr. McCray, who declined to comment when reached by phone, told WUSA-TV that the two people became angry when he asked them to leave the property. They quickly returned, he said, with three friends, who were also white. Mr. McCray said that the five people surrounded him and began using racial slurs, and that one head-butted him while another shoved him from behind.
 In a sermon on June 7, a video recording of which he posted to YouTube, Mr. McCray told his congregation at the Lighthouse Church and Marketplace Ministries in Woodstock, Va., that one of the people ''ran to me full speed snatching his shirt off, jumping in my face, and then he circled around behind me.''
 ''These same individuals were threatening my life telling me that my black life and the Black Lives Matter stuff, they don't give a darn about that in this county and they could care less and 'we will kill you,''' Mr. McCray said.
 Fearing for his life, Mr. McCray told WUSA-TV that he pulled out his gun and ''pointed it down to the ground in hopes that they would back off.''
 Then he called 911. Deputies from the Shenandoah County Sheriff's Office arrived and arrested Mr. McCray, who was charged with brandishing a firearm, a misdemeanor.
 According to Virginia law, it is legal for a person to brandish a weapon in ''justifiable self-defense.'' Mr. McCray later told his congregation that he had a license to carry a concealed weapon.
 The Shenandoah County sheriff, Timothy C. Carter, issued a statement late last week in which he said he had spoken with Mr. McCray on June 3, two days after the incident, and apologized. He said the five people who confronted Mr. McCray had been taken into custody on various charges, including hate crimes.
 Sheriff Carter also said that he had placed two supervisors in his department on administrative leave, and that he had asked the Shenandoah County Attorney's Office to drop the brandishing charge against Mr. McCray.
 ''After talking with him about the incident, it was apparent to me that the charge of brandishing was certainly not appropriate,'' Sheriff Carter wrote. ''Actually, as I told Mr. McCray, if I were faced with similar circumstances, I would have probably done the same thing.''
 In an interview on Wednesday, Sheriff Carter said he had ordered an internal review into the incident. More broadly, he said his department was taking a look at its own conduct and policies in light of the national unrest over police brutality that followed the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
 ''We're learning a lot from our involvement in this incident, and we're trying to learn and be better as we move through this,'' he said.
 Court documents show that Mr. McCray still faces the brandishing charge. On Tuesday, the Shenandoah County Commonwealth attorney, Amanda McDonald Wiseley, filed what is known as a nolle prosequi motion to dismiss the charge. If a judge approves the motion, prosecutors will still have the authority to charge Mr. McCray.
 Mr. McCray's lawyer, Chris Kowalczuk, said in an interview that he would prefer for the charge to be dismissed ''with prejudice,'' meaning prosecutors will not have the power to refile it.
 ''There's a big difference in discontinuing a prosecution that can be brought back and a dismissal,'' Mr. Kowalczuk said.
 The Shenandoah County Commonwealth Attorney's Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
 In his June 7 sermon, Mr. McCray reflected on how Mr. Floyd's death in police custody in Minneapolis had ''changed something'' in the fight against police brutality in the United States and around the world.
 ''It shifted something in myself and probably many people alike,'' he said. ''This tragedy of unbelievable death has catapulted this country and the world with a clarion call for change that will not be denied.''

WASHINGTON, Sept. 15, 2020 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law Hosts 20th Annual Gala to Celebrate Racial Justice, Diversity and Inclusion
The Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, the nation's preeminent civil rights organization, will host its 20th annual A. Leon Higginbotham Corporate Leadership Award Event on Thursday, September 17, 2020 at 3pm ET. This marquis event highlights the multifaceted work of the Lawyers' Committee while shining a light on corporate leaders and civil rights champions.
This year, the Lawyers' Committee honors David Abney, Executive Chairman of UPS, with the 2020 A. Leon Higginbotham Corporate Leadership Award. The Award Event, now in its 20th year, recognizes corporate leaders who embody exemplary practices in promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace and celebrates civil rights icons.
""For the past 57 years, we have been on the front-lines in the fight to advance racial justice and equality across the nation,"" said Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. ""Our A. Leon Higginbotham Event shines a light on our work to advance racial justice, provides an opportunity to highlight corporations that exemplify best practices with respect to diversity and inclusion, and allows us to lift up champions for racial and social justice. We are proud to recognize UPS for their efforts to promote diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace. This year, the Higginbotham Event takes on special significance in helping accelerate our work to protect voting rights, advance racial justice and promote equality for Black people following the tragic killings of Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and many others.""
In addition to honoring Mr. Abney, the event will celebrate the significant contributions of several other notable individuals. Nikole Hannah-Jones will receive the organization's Beacon of Justice Award for her Pulitzer-winning The 1619 Project, The New York Times Magazine's groundbreaking exploration of the legacy of Black Americans starting with the arrival of the first enslaved Africans in 1619.

Fox News founder Rupert Murdoch has predicted that Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden will defeat President Donald Trump ""in a landslide"" in the November 3 elections.
The conservative media mogul has grown increasingly frustrated with President Trump, particularly in regards to his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed over 220,000 people in the US, reported The Daily Beast.
""After all that has gone on, people are ready for Sleepy Joe,"" Murdoch is quoted as having told an associate.
""The president is his own worst enemy,"" he told his associates, adding that, ""He's creating a never-ending crisis for his administration.""
Murdoch, the network's founder and co-chairman, had maintained close contacts with Trump, but the two have not spoken in weeks reportedly because Murdoch is tired of the president's complaints about negative coverage on his favorite news channel.
Murdoch, 89, is ""semi-retired"" from daily operations of his media empire, which the magnate has handed off to his eldest son Lachlan Murdoch.
Murdoch's wife purportedly donated $500 to the Biden campaign and James, his youngest son gave $1.2 million to the Biden Victory Fund in June.
James also publicly condemned the Trump administration, which he told The New York Times, ""seems characterized by callousness and a level of cruelty that I think is really dangerous.""
""It's not a coincidence that the number of hate crimes in this country are rising over the last three years for the first time in a long time,"" he told the daily.
With less than three weeks until Election Day, polls show that Biden has maintained a double-digit lead over President Trump.
The former Democratic vice president leads the Republican incumbent 54 percent to 43 percent among likely voters, according to the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll.
It is the highest level of support Biden has achieved since the poll began the head-to-head matchup in February.

The Western Mail's chief reporter has been dropped from the judging panel of Wales Book of the Year for a series of tweets about a Black Lives Matter protest in Cardiff.
Shipton, a staple of Welsh journalism for decades, pointed out that this gathering broke the lockdown introduced to control a virus that had cost 'many more lives than the Minneapolis police'.
He was certainly not defending the actions of officers in the death of George Floyd; indeed, he described them as 'murder'. Rather, Shipton was arguing that 'holding a demo in front of Cardiff Castle' about something that happened half way around the world was 'politically naive and virtue signalling'. The Twitter Inquisition, which everyone expects at this point, gathered their torches and out a-heretic-burning they went. Shipton, for his part, defended himself in decidedly robust terms, prompting Literature Wales to axe him for 'aggressive language'.
I have met Shipton and briefly worked alongside him. He struck me as a staunch liberal who took the progressive position on all the big issues of the day. Ironically, I recall him being especially acidic about the uptick of racism occasioned, as he saw it, by the rise of populist politics in Britain and the United States. For voicing the wrong opinion on protest tactics he is now beyond the pale.
He is not the only one. Manx Radio host Stu Peters has been suspended after questioning the doctrine of 'white privilege' on-air. When a black caller referred to 'white people's privilege', Peters responded: 'I've had no more privilege in my life than you have.' His radio station referred itself to the communications watchdog and issued a statement declaring it 'does not condone racism in any form amongst its staff'.
That tension is in the air is hardly surprising after the killing of Mr Floyd. From the two post-mortems performed and the video of his arrest, it is clear that his final minutes were filled with terror and suffering. His death was a tragedy but it was more than that: it was an outrage. Thousands have filled the streets to protest peacefully against what they see as police racism but others have rioted, looted and attacked the police.
The potential for turning the peaceful protests into meaningful change is being undermined by a refusal to engage in dialogue. Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey, who is sympathetic to the protests, was booed and heckled out of one rally because he would not agree to abolish the city's entire police department.
The stoutly liberal New York Times also backs the demonstrators but, among its reams of supportive columns, it published one op-ed by a Republican senator calling for the military to quell the riots. Inflammatory, no doubt, but a stance supported by 58 per cent of US voters. Not 800 New York Times staff members, though, who signed an open letter condemning their own newspaper for running the op-ed, with many insisting that 'running this puts black New York Times writers, editors and other staff in danger'.
There is a lot of raw, quite justifiable anger over these events, but that is not the root cause of this intense hostility towards different ideas. It has been roiling away for some time now. Entire swathes of opinion that run contrary to progressive thinking are being designated 'problematic', then 'inappropriate', before those who espouse them are finally 'cancelled'.
In public debates about mainstream policy and ideas, the object is no longer to beat the other side but to prevent the other side from speaking.
Fanatical Not all that long ago the Left was the champion of free speech against conservatives who believed it was the state's place to censor ideas, art and literature the community considered morally harmful. Liberals and radicals said they should be free to say and write and create whatever they wanted.
But in toppling the old moral standards and the establishment that guarded them, progressives have imposed their own morals. Unsurprisingly, the new establishment is just as enthusiastic about suppressing ideas that scandalise its morality as the old establishment was.
This orthodox liberalism, which bears only a passing resemblance to actual liberalism, is rigid, doctrinaire and angrily intolerant of dissent.
It displays a religious, near fanatical, conviction that its opponents are not merely wrong but wicked, sinful, in need of wrathful destruction. Once you convince yourself that those who disagree are evil, you no longer feel the need to listen to them and eventually you decide no one else should listen to them either.
The tyranny of certainty runs through all sectors, from the arts and the media to academia and business. More than 300 Guardian staff penned a letter to their editor condemning Left-wing columnist Suzanne Moore for her views on gender.
The Right-wing actor Laurence Fox was denounced by his own actors' union for expressing his contempt for the concept of 'white privilege' on Question Time.
On the university campuses, noplatforming - a tactic designed to counter fascists - is being deployed against radical feminists who assert that sex is a biological fact. Former Home Secretary Amber Rudd was disinvited to an Oxford University society over her handling of the Windrush scandal. The university's student union council has called for the removal from the curriculum of teaching materials perceived as 'hateful'. Even the impeccably liberal JK Rowling is reviled for saying terms like 'woman' should not be erased lest it becomes harder for women to speak up for their rights.
The Scottish Government is particularly guilty of this behaviour. Its 'Dear Bigots' advertising campaign was justly criticised for trying to place great lengths of the political and religious spectrum beyond legitimate debate. Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf 's Hate Crime Bill does much the same in seeking to regulate speech and even plays deemed 'abusive' or 'insulting' to certain groups.
Underlying all this is the conviction that views outwith a narrow progressive consensus are more than just wrong, or even wicked, but actively dangerous. There is a theory in international relations called securitisation and it goes something like this: if you want to take an issue out of the realm of politics, you frame it as a matter of national security.
Once a subject has been 'securitised' it is not a topic for public debate and must be dealt with urgently by prime ministers, Army chiefs and experts. A commonly cited example is the UK's involvement in the Iraq War, which went from a national conversation about the merits of joining US forces to a security situation in which Saddam Hussein's 'weapons of mass destruction' posed an immediate threat to British lives and interests.
Progressive censors are trying to apply this technique to speech and ideas of which they disapprove. In making alternative opinions a threat to the security or well-being of particular groups or society at large, they are essentially declaring politics to be finished. People who behave like this do not want a conversation, they are in the business of issuing orders.
This mindset is much more dangerous than the unpopular, obnoxious or reactionary views it seeks to squelch. Once you decide only your side may participate in the public discourse, and those who disagree must be shunned, shamed, kicked off a panel, or fired from their job, there no longer is a public discourse.
There is just you and those who think like you radiating virtue from an evernarrowing circle of certainty that may one day become too small for you."

The Senate Commerce Committee has summoned Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Sundar Pichai to testify for a hearing Wednesday. The executives agreed to appear remotely after being threatened with subpoenas.
With the presidential election looming, Republicans led by President Donald Trump have thrown a barrage of grievances at Big Tech's social media platforms, which they accuse without evidence of deliberately suppressing conservative, religious and anti-abortion views.
The chorus of protest rose this month after Facebook and Twitter acted to limit dissemination of an unverified political story from the conservative-leaning New York Post about Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, an unprecedented action against a major media outlet. The story, which was not confirmed by other publications, cited unverified emails from Biden's son Hunter that were reportedly disclosed by Trump allies.
Beyond questioning the CEOs, senators are expected to examine proposals to revise long-held legal protections for online speech, an immunity that critics in both parties say enables the companies to abdicate their responsibility to impartially moderate content.
The Justice Department has asked Congress to strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the tech companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms. Trump signed an executive order challenging the protections from lawsuits under the 1996 telecommunications law.
""For too long, social media platforms have hidden behind Section 230 protections to censor content that deviates from their beliefs,"" Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., the Commerce Committee chairman, said recently.
In their opening statements prepared for the hearing, Dorsey, Zuckerberg and Pichai addressed the proposals for changes to so-called Section 230, a provision of a 1996 law that has served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet. Zuckerberg said Congress ""should update the law to make sure it's working as intended.""
""We don't think tech companies should be making so many decisions about these important issues alone,"" he said, approving an active role for government regulators.
Dorsey and Pichai, however, urged caution in making any changes. ""Undermining Section 230 will result in far more removal of online speech and impose severe limitations on our collective ability to address harmful content and protect people online,"" Dorsey said.
Pichai urged lawmakers ""to be very thoughtful about any changes to Section 230 and to be very aware of the consequences those changes might have on businesses and consumers.""
Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd told congressional leaders in a letter Tuesday that recent events have made the changes more urgent. He cited the action by Twitter and Facebook regarding the New York Post story, calling the companies' limitations ""quite concerning.""
The head of the Federal Communications Commission, an independent agency, recently announced plans to reexamine the legal protections, potentially putting meat on the bones of Trump's order by opening the way to new rules. The move by FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, a Trump appointee, marked an about-face from the agency's previous position.
Social media giants are also under heavy scrutiny for their efforts to police misinformation about the election. Twitter and Facebook have slapped a misinformation label on content from the president, who has around 80 million followers. Trump has raised the baseless prospect of mass fraud in the vote-by-mail process.
Starting Tuesday, Facebook was not accepting any new political advertising. Previously booked political ads will be able to run until the polls close next Tuesday, when all political advertising will temporarily be banned. Google, which owns YouTube, also is halting political ads after the polls close. Twitter banned all political ads last year.
Democrats have focused their criticism of social media mainly on hate speech, misinformation and other content that can incite violence or keep people from voting. They have criticized Big Tech CEOs for failing to police content, homing in on the platforms' role in hate crimes and the rise of white nationalism in the U.S.
Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have scrambled to stem the tide of material that incites violence and spreads lies and baseless conspiracy theories.
The companies reject accusations of bias but have wrestled with how strongly they should intervene. They have often gone out of their way not to appear biased against conservative views - a posture that some say effectively tilts them toward those viewpoints. The effort has been especially strained for Facebook, which was caught off-guard in 2016, when it was used as a conduit by Russian agents to spread misinformation benefiting Trump's presidential campaign.
The unwelcome attention to the three companies piles onto the anxieties in the tech industry, which also faces scrutiny from the Justice Department, federal regulators, Congress and state attorneys general around the country.
Last week, the Justice Department sued Google for abusing its dominance in online search and advertising - the government's most significant attempt to protect competition since its groundbreaking case against Microsoft more than 20 years ago.
With antitrust in the spotlight, Facebook, Apple and Amazon also are under investigation at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission.

""For too long, social media platforms have hidden behind Section 230 protections to censor content that deviates from their beliefs,"" Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., the Commerce Committee chairman, said recently.
In their opening statements prepared for the hearing, Dorsey, Zuckerberg and Pichai addressed the proposals for changes to so-called Section 230, a provision of a 1996 law that has served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet. Zuckerberg said Congress ""should update the law to make sure it's working as intended.""
""We don't think tech companies should be making so many decisions about these important issues alone,"" he said, approving an active role for government regulators.
Dorsey and Pichai, however, urged caution in making any changes. ""Undermining Section 230 will result in far more removal of online speech and impose severe limitations on our collective ability to address harmful content and protect people online,"" Dorsey said.
Pichai urged lawmakers ""to be very thoughtful about any changes to Section 230 and to be very aware of the consequences those changes might have on businesses and consumers.""
Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd told congressional leaders in a letter Tuesday that recent events have made the changes more urgent. He cited the action by Twitter and Facebook regarding the New York Post story, calling the companies' limitations ""quite concerning.""
The head of the Federal Communications Commission, an independent agency, recently announced plans to reexamine the legal protections, potentially putting meat on the bones of Trump's order by opening the way to new rules. The move by FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, a Trump appointee, marked an about-face from the agency's previous position.
Social media giants are also under heavy scrutiny for their efforts to police misinformation about the election. Twitter and Facebook have slapped a misinformation label on content from the president, who has around 80 million followers. Trump has raised the baseless prospect of mass fraud in the vote-by-mail process.
Starting Tuesday, Facebook was not accepting any new political advertising. Previously booked political ads will be able to run until the polls close next Tuesday, when all political advertising will temporarily be banned. Google, which owns YouTube, also is halting political ads after the polls close. Twitter banned all political ads last year.
Democrats have focused their criticism of social media mainly on hate speech, misinformation and other content that can incite violence or keep people from voting. They have criticized Big Tech CEOs for failing to police content, homing in on the platforms' role in hate crimes and the rise of white nationalism in the U.S.
Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have scrambled to stem the tide of material that incites violence and spreads lies and baseless conspiracy theories.
The companies reject accusations of bias but have wrestled with how strongly they should intervene. They have often gone out of their way not to appear biased against conservative views - a posture that some say effectively tilts them toward those viewpoints. The effort has been especially strained for Facebook, which was caught off-guard in 2016, when it was used as a conduit by Russian agents to spread misinformation benefiting Trump's presidential campaign.
The unwelcome attention to the three companies piles onto the anxieties in the tech industry, which also faces scrutiny from the Justice Department, federal regulators, Congress and state attorneys general around the country.
Last week, the Justice Department sued Google for abusing its dominance in online search and advertising - the government's most significant attempt to protect competition since its groundbreaking case against Microsoft more than 20 years ago.
With antitrust in the spotlight, Facebook, Apple and Amazon also are under investigation at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission.

The Senate Commerce Committee has summoned Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Sundar Pichai to testify for a hearing Wednesday. The executives agreed to appear remotely after being threatened with subpoenas.
With the presidential election looming, Republicans led by President Donald Trump have thrown a barrage of grievances at Big Tech's social media platforms, which they accuse without evidence of deliberately suppressing conservative, religious and anti-abortion views.
The chorus of protest rose this month after Facebook and Twitter acted to limit dissemination of an unverified political story from the conservative-leaning New York Post about Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, an unprecedented action against a major media outlet. The story, which was not confirmed by other publications, cited unverified emails from Biden's son Hunter that were reportedly disclosed by Trump allies.
Beyond questioning the CEOs, senators are expected to examine proposals to revise long-held legal protections for online speech, an immunity that critics in both parties say enables the companies to abdicate their responsibility to impartially moderate content.

132,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1001/Files (250).DOCX","ABC Premium News (Australia)",2020-06-12,"931 words",NA,"By Elias Clure",NA,"ABC News journalist Elias Clure on racism and the importance of a black reporter covering a Black Lives Matter protest",FALSE,"Being a black reporter in Australia can be challenging.
I've dealt with my fair share of racism on the road: I've been mistaken for criminals while covering court, I've been asked how to pronounce African names and I've been called ""darky"" by someone I was interviewing.
I've also reported on racist incidents and hate crimes.
But the week leading up to the Black Lives Matter protests across Australia was by far the toughest period of my seven-year career - and perhaps my life.
If I was to describe what racism feels like, I would say it's akin to a kick in the guts.
It's hard to think of a lower, more humiliating feeling.
What really hurts is when progress is made, but an act of hate or ignorance sets it all back.
Every black person has experienced this feeling.
You get to a point where you think: ""Hey, people don't judge me for the colour of my skin.""
Then bang! Someone calls you a name or typecasts you and that all comes crashing down.
Two shocking incidents, captured on video and gone viral, brought this home to black people everywhere.
On May 25, images of a white Minneapolis police officer kneeling on a helpless black man's neck for more than eight minutes - ultimately leading to George Floyd's death - were beamed around the world.
Then Amy Cooper, a white finance worker in New York, called the police on a black birdwatcher who had simply asked her to put her dog on a leash.
Christian Cooper (no relation), the birdwatcher, later told theNew York Times: ""There are certain dark societal impulses that she, as a white woman facing a conflict with a black man, that she thought she could marshal to her advantage and she went there.""
So, by the end of May we weren't feeling a kick in the guts, it was like copping a cricket bat to the midriff and a slap in the face all in one.
The Black Lives Matter movement is now seven years old but when people of colour see videos like those, we can't help but think nothing has really changed.
The ensuing violence did not surprise me at all, people are angry.
Personally, I don't think I'd ever felt worse - it's sadness, humiliation, dejection and a little anger as well.
As it looked more and more like Australian activists' groups would be holding their own rallies, I instantly felt conflicted about covering one.
For me, this isn't about personal politics or my personal views on a certain issue - it's my identity.
Whether I believe in the Black Lives Matter movement or not, I have a lived experience of racism and of course I want it to end - it bloody sucks!
When I saw that I was rostered on to cover last weekend's Melbourne rally I became very nervous, I was struggling to sleep.
I wasn't worried that I would write a blatantly biased story in open support of the protestors, it was because of how distressed I felt about the whole issue.
I thought hearing more stories of racism and injustice aired at the rally would be too much for me to handle.
My mind changed two days before the protest when I saw a black CNN reporter do a live cross into Sydney's Nine news.
Anchor Peter Overton asked when she thought the violence would end and she quipped, ""there's no end in sight because there is no end in sight to this racism"".
It resonated with me.
Constantly seeing white people report on nuanced issues of race is exhausting.
It's not that white journalists can't do a great job, they can, I just don't think they can bring as comprehensive an understanding.
I explain it to people like this: Australia's best court reporter could probably write an excellent sports story if they had to, but they wouldn't be a news director's first choice to cover an AFL grand final.
It also exposes a glaring lack of diversity in news coverage across the board, although the ABC is trying to address this with a Diversity Action Plan for its workforce and content to better reflect the entire Australian community.
I began to think that this was an excellent opportunity for me to utilise my lived experience and bring a different perspective and face to our coverage.
The supervising producer on the day reassured me it was my choice to cover the story or ask for it to be assigned to another reporter, a mentor offered emotional support and our deputy news editor advised on how to stay safe if things got out of hand.
The protest went ahead, thankfully it was peaceful.
As it unfolded, I was in ""journalist mode"", gathering information, listening to the speeches to pick out grabs, looking at the signs and faces in the crowd to work in the best visual elements of my story.
My focus had shifted from how I felt personally to how I would produce the best news story.
A live cross into the 7pm News reported on the fines that would be issued to the organisers for holding the protest in defiance of social distancing rules.
Afterwards, people of colour and white people reached out to me on social media and thanked me for my reporting. I've covered a few protests and that's never happened before.
A person I'd never met before said: ""Thanks for your coverage, you're out there representing us, so thank you!""
I can't help but think it was because it was refreshing to see a black face report on black issues.
My mum watched it from home and texted me: ""Thank you for being a young black man in the world and country that sometimes doesn't see or understand you and not letting that stop you from being who you are.
""Today isn't the first day you've had to represent, you have to every day, it can be tiring - all you can do is shine.""

The Nobel prize winner is famous for holding right wing views. When asked, he said that Israel should annex the Jordan Valley and a portion (30%) of the West Bank on July 1 as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanayhu said he will do 'and not talk it to death.' When asked about the chance of a peace agreement with the Palestinians he said that some things should not be a matter of compromise. 'The Arabs are also not flexible, they say everything belongs to them', he argued. 
""We Jews should not waiver in our conviction that this is our rightful historical homeland, 'dating back thousands of years.'Aumann won the Nobel prize in 2005 for the contribution his research of Game Theory made in the field of economics.His research helped understand how seemingly irrational actions might, in reality, be rational when we take into account the situations they work with and the logic guiding them. For example, in his Nobel speech called ""War and Peace,"" he explained how the seemingly irrational act of building enough nuclear bombs to destroy the planet is effective in preventing war because the other side can't know if these weapons will be used or not. Aumann joked with the reporter that until he won the prize, he worked in science. But as the prize tends to be the best sales promoter in the world, he said 'I now work in sales', referringg to the sales of his theories. A tale of two countries: The politics of indigeneity in Israel[2] While the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is often thought of as a complex and highly-nuanced topic, any understanding of the conflict ultimately revolves around a single question, the question of who is indigenous to the land. All the differing perspectives on Israel boil down to whether they consider Jews or Arabs the original inhabitants of the region.A common narrative regarding indigeneity is that Palestinians are the original inhabitants of the land, and anti-Zionists frequently make claims based on the premise that Palestinians are the indigenous people and Israelis are the occupiers.Chairman of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, stated to the UN Security Council, that '[W]e are the descendants of the Canaanites who lived in the land of Palestine 5,000 years ago, and continuously remained there to this day.'Linda Sarsour, an Arab-American activist tweeted, 'Jesus was a Palestinian of Nazareth.'Jonathan Cook wrote in The Electronic Intifada that Israel is systematically 'Hebraizing' Arab city names in order to erase an Arab connection to the land, and accused Israel of turning al-Quds into Yerushalayim, al-Nasra into Natzrat, and Jaffa into Yafo. In doing so, the article assumes that the Palestinian connection to the land is longer than that of the Jews.But do the facts support these claims that Palestinians are the original inhabitants of the land?Linguistic analysis provides insight into this central question. In the 2nd millennium BCE, the inhabitants of Canaan, what is modern-day Israel, all spoke a language called Proto-Canaanite. Over time, their language underwent a phonetic shift known as the Canaanite Shift, which was characterized by a transition from an ā vowel to an o vowel. All the languages that descended from this Proto-Canaanite language had this o vowel in place of the ā, while the other Semitic languages from outside the region of Canaan kept the original ā.The effect of the shift is still noticeable today. For example, the word for peace in Hebrew is Shalom, demonstrating the vowel shift, whereas Arabic keeps the ā vowel in Salām: Hebrew's vowel shift indicates it was historically spoken in Canaan, while Arabic's lack of the vowel shift suggests it developed outside of Canaan.The Electronic Intifada article claims that the Arabic name of Yafa is the original term for the place, but as the true indigenous people would have used the vowel-shifted name of Yafo, as Hebrew does, the truth is laid bare: Arabic doesn't fulfill the criteria to be a native language to Israel. The linguistic patterns of Arabic are consistent with the historical context -#8212; Palestinians are Arabs, who are indigenous to the Arabian peninsula, but their indigenous claims do not extend to Israel.https://1.bp.blogspot.com/proxy/IX9FCrONg6WFuWsaBUVB4I_yW-jEFZ1V-e1fVL5PWGPTBIm-VFtcYEZCbFbyPD9oypZ7FirRcEqZB3Ps90oIDhkIxMQ=s0-d""People of certain lineages of people who want to delegitimize our leaders... who will say Linda is anti-Israel...'That's a longgg convoluted way of saying 'blame the Jews'. pic.twitter.com/JmyPLMXoZT[3] — Hen Mazzig (@HenMazzig) June 6, 2020[4] Lawyer, 31, who 'hurled a Molotov cocktail at a NYPD van' is back in custody as bail decision is REVERSED after she said Mayor Bill de Blasio is to blame for not holding back cops during violent protests[5] The New York City lawyers accused of hurling a Molotov cocktail into a NYPD van are back in custody after a decision to release them on bail was reversed in court. On Friday, the US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York announced that lawyers Urooj Rahman, 31, and Clinford Mattis, 32, were back in federal custody after the U.S . Court of Appeals reversed the bail decision by the District Court. Meanwhile, a video has emerged that reveals Rahman blaming Mayor Bill de Blasio for not restraining officers for their own safety less than one hour before the alleged incident.Last week, Rahman and Mattis were arrested for throwing a Molotov cocktail at the police cruiser during volatile clashes over the death of George Floyd at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.They were chased by police and charged with attempting to damage or destroy law-enforcement vehicle by fire or explosives, which carries a minimum of five years in jail and maximum of 20 years. In a new video from May 30, Rahman claimed de Blasio should have pulled back the city's law enforcement like Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis did.'I think the mayor should have pulled his police officers back in the way the mayor in Minneapolis did, she said, while standing near the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. 'I think the mayor should have done that, because if he really cared about his police officers, he should have realized that it's not worth them getting hurt.'

Her defenders, however, said these criticisms led to death threats against the Congresswoman.'Clearly, there could only be one reason that someone would criticize an elected member of Congress, and that is sheer bigotry,' Representative Ro Khanna said on the House floor. 'No criticism of Congresswoman Omar's religious beliefs, her actions, or her political views will be tolerated.'After initially resisting, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was forced to bring the bill to the floor after several progressive party members threatened to lock themselves in their rooms until she agreed to do so. For some freshman lawmakers, however, the bill does not go far enough.'While this bill may punish some bigots who openly criticize the Congresswoman, it will do nothing to discourage millions of others who think bad things but do not say them,' New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez explained. 'We need to find a way to bring justice to anyone who thinks bad things about her. Like a 'thought police' - why hasn't anyone else thought of that?'NYC's virtual Celebrate Israel parade postponed over George Floyd protests[9] First, the coronavirus moved one of the world's largest demonstrations of support for Israel online. Now, the Celebrate Israel parade is being delayed to make time for New York Jews to hear from black leaders about racism.The Jewish Community Relations Council of New York has postponed the parade, originally set for June 7, '[i]n recognition of the protests occurring across the country and in memoriam of George Floyd and the many other victims of racism and hate in America.'In its place, the JCRC announced Friday that it would hold 'An Online Conversation on Racism in America' on Zoom. 'This virtual gathering will provide an opportunity for Jews and non-Jews alike to hear messages from prominent Black community leaders in New York,' the council said in a press release.The event's participants will include New York Attorney General Letitia James; Jennifer Jones Austin, CEO of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Associations; Tamara Fish, the former president of the Jewish Multiracial Network; Rev. Charles Galbreath, senior pastor of the Clarendon Road Church in Flatbush, Brooklyn; and Samuel M. Pierre, chief of staff for New York City Council Member Farah Louis.Coronavirus crisis in Israel: 257 new cases over the weekend[10] The number of coronavirus cases in Israel is exponentially growing. Over the weekend, between 7 p.m. Thursday and the same time Saturday, some 257 people were diagnosed with COVID-19. Among the newly infected are seven residents of a senior living facility in Or Yehuda.'We need to assume that we are in an outbreak of unknown magnitude,"" said outgoing Health Ministry director-general Moshe Bar Siman Tov during recent internal deliberations, according to the Hebrew media site N12. He said that the number of coronavirus cases continues to expand and that 'it will take time until we understand the extent' of the challenge. Sources in the meeting claimed he used the term ""second wave,"" which he later denied.Three more people died over the weekend, bringing the total to 295. Of the 2,407 active cases, some 21 are intubated.However, it should be noted that the number of people being tested for the virus has nearly tripled. The Health Ministry reported that more than 16,160 people were tested on Friday and more than 7,000 on Saturday by 7:30 p.m., with the expectation that more people would be screened by midnight.The increased screening comes on the backdrop of a change in testing policy, rolled out by newly appointed Health Minister Yuli Edelstein. Now, people with or without coronavirus symptoms can request screening.Previously, testing was designated for those who were in quarantine and showed symptoms. For asymptomatic cases, people were eligible to be tested only if they had stayed in the vicinity of a confirmed coronavirus patient for more than 15 minutes or had returned from a country with a high rate of infections.Holocaust survivor leaves hospital after beating coronavirus[11] Steffi Goldberger Berg, 92, a Holocaust survivor who lives in Broward Country, Florida, survived a coronavirus infection, according to a local ABC news report.'Every single one did their best and took care of me like a baby,' Berg said, according to ABC.She was treated by the medical staff at Holy Cross Hospital in Fort Lauderdale.'The past 12 weeks have been unbelievable,' said Cindy Berg Vayonis, one of her daughters, according to ABC. 'This is a miracle. This is a true miracle.'However, in the process of surviving her infection Golberger Berg lost her husband, Willie Berg, to COVID-19. He died at their home in Fort Lauderdale in late March.She and one of her daughters, who donated plasma to help treat her mother, were diagnosed five days after her husband died.The two met in Shanghai after fleeing Germany during the World War II. After the war, they made Aliyah and moved to Israel, then settled in the United States in 1954.Berg leaves behind three daughters, five grandchildren and one great-grandchild.Israeli company to develop thermal cameras that detect coronavirus[12] Foresight, an Israeli company, announced that it is developing mass-screening thermal cameras capable of detecting coronavirus symptoms, Israeli Auto Channel reported.The system will be based on forward-looking infrared cameras, typically used on military and civilian aircraft, use a thermographic camera that senses infrared radiation (FLIR) thermal cameras, artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced algorithms designed to detect coronavirus symptoms. This could increase the likelihood to of detection and even minimize false positive results.'The COVID-19 pandemic has created new challenges for public safety, prioritizing the prevention of another pandemic outbreak as the world begins to resume normal activities."" said Haim Siboni, CEO of Foresight.""Our extensive experience with thermal imaging and AI can be invaluable when applied to a detection solution for early symptoms of the coronavirus. Several prospective customers have already expressed interest in evaluating our unique technology,"" Siboni added.Foresight specializes in developing technology designed to help prevent accidents for the automobile industry. The company's systems are designed to improve driving safety by enabling highly accurate and reliable threat detection while ensuring the lowest rates of false alerts.Scientists find link between COVID-19 severity and genetics[13] Genetic variations may be what causes different people to suffer from different symptoms of the coronavirus, according to a new study by European scientists, The New York Times reported.The study, which has not been peer-reviewed yet, is the first to find a strong statistical link between genetic variations and COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus.Variations at two spots in the human genome are associated with an increased risk of respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients, according to the study. Patients with Type A blood were linked to a 50% increase in the likelihood in needing to get oxygen or go on a ventilator, reported the Times.Oddly enough, variations in ACE2, the protein to which the virus attaches itself on the surface of human cells, did not seem to make a difference in the severity of the virus.""There are new kids on the block now,' said Andre Franke, a molecular geneticist at the University of Kiel in Germany and a co-author of the new study, according to the Times.While age and preexisting conditions have already been found to increase the risk of severe cases of COVID-19, geneticists are hoping that DNA tests could help identify at-risk patients as well.Researchers race for coronavirus vaccine but question effectiveness[14] The race is on for a coronavirus vaccine, with more than 130 in development globally, including 10 in clinical evaluation, according to the World Health Organization.Out of those 10, there are two leading candidates entering Phase 3 trials in the next month. One from US-based biotech company Moderna and the other a collaboration between the University of Oxford and UK-based biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca.'From January when the virus was identified, to going into Phase 3, that's unprecedented. That has never been done before,' Dr. Anna Durbin, professor of medicine and public health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told The Media Line. 'But because of the urgency and the need for a vaccine, that's why we are proceeding at risk.'Accelerating the development process doesn't impact safety. The risk refers to the cost of testing tens of thousands of people for an efficacy study and manufacturing millions and eventually billions of doses before knowing if the vaccine will even work in preventing the coronavirus, Durbin explained.On Thursday, for example, AstraZeneca announced a $750 million deal with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, to manufacture and distribute 300 million doses of the Oxford vaccine candidate by the end of 2020. AstraZeneca also inked a deal with the Serum Institute of India for one billion doses, with a goal of 400 million by the year's end.Israel Donates Wheelchairs to Coronavirus-Stricken Ecuador[15] Israel donated a shipment of wheelchairs on Friday to the mayor of Quito, the capital of Ecuador, one of the Latin American nations hardest hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.'The wheelchairs will contribute to the recovery of patients with Covid19 in the Quito Temporary Care Center,' Amir Sagron — deputy chief of mission and consul of Israel in Ecuador — tweeted.In the name of the State of Israel , the Embassy of Israel in Ecuador presented a special donation of wheelchairs to the Mayor of Ecuador's capital-Quito, Jorge Yunda The wheelchairs will contribute to the recovery of patients with Covid19 in the Quito Temporary Care Center pic.twitter.com/m3S5O1Sbca[16] — Amir Sagron (@AmirSagron) June 5, 2020[17] ;Ecuador, a country of 17 million people, has seen over 40,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases and more than 3,000 deaths.Thousands rally in Tel Aviv against Netanyahu's annexation plans[18] Thousands of Israelis gathered in Tel Aviv Saturday evening to protest Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's pledge to begin annexing parts of the West Bank next month.Police initially sought to block the rally but backtracked Friday after meeting with organizers, who urged participants to wear masks and adhere to social distancing guidelines.Dozens of officers were securing the demonstration after police said attendance would be capped at 2,000, though the Haaretz daily put turnout at 6,000 people in what appeared to be the largest protest in the country since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.The demonstration was organized by the left-wing Meretz party and the communist Hadash faction of the majority-Arab Joint List, along with several other left-wing rights groups.MK Nitzan Horowitz, the head of Meretz, told the crowd that annexation would be a 'war crime' and cost Israel millions as the economy is already reeling due to the pandemic.'We cannot replace an occupation of dozens of years with an apartheid that will last forever,' shouted a hoarse Horowitz. 'Yes, to two states for two peoples, no to violence and bloodshed,' he continued. 'No to annexation, yes to peace.'Horowitz said annexation was 'a crime against peace, a crime against humanity, a crime that will result in bloodshed.' Khaled Abu Toameh: Shtayyeh to EU: Impose sanctions on Israel, recognize Palestinian state[19] Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh has called on the European Union to impose sanctions on Israel to prevent it from extending its sovereignty to parts of the West Bank. He also called on the EU to recognize a Palestinian state on the pre-1967 lines, with east Jerusalem as its capital.Shtayyeh made his appeal during a phone conversation on Friday with EU President Charles Michel.Shtayyeh stressed the importance of 'serious and practical EU steps' to confront the Israeli plan, including imposing sanctions on Israel and recognition of the State of Palestine on the 1967 borders, with east Jerusalem as its capital,' according to a statement released by the PA premier's office.The statement quoted Michel as emphasizing the EU's 'clear belief in the two-state solution and rejection of Israeli annexation plans, which contravene international law.'The EU president reportedly told Shtayyeh that he would contact Israel and the US administration in a bid to stop Israel from implanting the plan.Also Friday, Shtayyeh met in his office in Ramallah with Norway's special envoy for the Middle East peace process, Tor Wennesland, and discussed with him the latest political developments in the region, particularly Israel's intention to extend its sovereignty to parts of the West Bank.Jewish Group Attacks 'Hypocrisy' of Former Canadian Diplomats' Letter Warning Against West Bank Annexation[20] An open letter by a group of retired Canadian diplomats calling on their government to oppose an Israeli plan to annex the West Bank met with a sharp response on Friday from a leading Jewish organization.'We are disgusted with the blatant hypocrisy and double standards of the international community constantly directed against Israel. This letter is just the latest example of it,' Michael Mostyn — chief executive officer of B'nai Brith Canada — said in a statement. 'The status of the territories in question is a subject of major debate in international law, and Israel's claims are no less legitimate than anyone else's.'Mostyn was referring to the letter sent on Monday to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau by 58 former Canadian diplomats and politicians calling on him to challenge the Israeli government.'As you know, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has announced publicly his intention to 'annex' in the coming weeks a significant amount of land that Canada, and the international community, recognize as occupied Palestinian Territory,' the letter to Trudeau stated.'Territorial conquest and annexation are notorious for contributing to fateful results: war, political instability, economic ruin, systematic discrimination and human suffering,' the group warned.Mostyn observed that the letter made no mention of the fact that the 'internationally accepted bedrock of all Middle East peacemaking has long been UN Resolutions 242 and 338, which call for negotiations to achieve a just and durable peace.'Mostyn underlined that Israel had not yet formally presented its position on the future status of the West Bank, accusing the diplomats of rushing to condemn the Jewish state. Hi @ErakatSaeb[21], I'm curious, do Palestinians have such freedom of speech and democracy? Are they allowed to gather in Ramallah to protest against the PA and Mahmoud Abbas?

It also asked the judge to compel the Justice Ministry's Police Internal Investigations Department to confirm whether it has collected the CCTV footage, amid their fears that law enforcement will not use it in the probe of the May 30 incident.Halak was shot dead in Jerusalem's Old City last weekend while he was on his way to his school for individuals with special needs. Police said he had appeared to be holding a gun, but Halak was only holding a cellphone — as his father told the media — and apparently had not understood officers' orders to halt as he passed near the Lion's Gate. His caretaker, who witnessed the incident, told reporters that Halak fled on foot and hid in a garbage room, where he was shot at least seven times.The family noted in its petition that security cameras are installed in the alleys through which police chased Halak, as well as in the garbage room where he sought refuge.When the court convened on Wednesday to discuss the Halak petition, police representatives requested the hearing be closed to the public. The officers presented a gag-order that has been placed over the case, but because it only covers publication of the involved officers' names, the judge denied the request. MEMRI: Turkish Government Charity Organization Operates In Regions Of Syria Controlled By Hay'at Tahrir Al-Sham [28] The following report is now a complimentary offering from MEMRI's Jihad and Terrorism Threat Monitor (JTTM). For JTTM subscription information, click here.On May 30, 2020, an event honoring fighters wounded in battles against the Syrian regime and its allies was held in the city of Idlib, Syria, which is controlled by Hay'at Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS). The event, titled ""My Steadfastness Has No Limits"" and featuring the distribution of monetary grants to disabled fighters, was organized by the Turkish government-affiliated Türkiye Diyanet Vakfı (TDV) charity organization. It was extensively covered by the pro-rebel media, including the HTS news agency.[1]On its website, TDV bills itself as having been ""founded to support the activities of the [Turkish] Ministry of Religious Affairs, to help religious services reach more people, and for the raising of a generation employed in religious service,"" and states that it operates in 149 countries.[2]TDV operates in northern Syria, both in regions where Turkey implemented its Euphrates Shield and Olive Branch operations that are now essentially under Turkish control, and in HTS-controlled areas. For example, on September 25, 2019, it was reported that the organization had, in conjunction with the Pakistan-based Bayt Al-Salam charity organization, erected 100 homes in Idlib province for families of orphans, the disabled, and slain fighters.[3]As in the instance of the activity for the disabled fighters, it appears that TDV's activity in HTS-controlled areas is carried out with the approval of HTS, or at least with its knowledge of it. While previously there was a dispute between TDV and HTS over the administration of two refugee camps in HTS-controlled territory in Idlib, it was resolved that TDV would bring about the HTS-controlled Syrian Salvation Government's (SSG) approval of the appointments for the administration of both camps.[4]Thus, the TDV joins the ranks of Turkish charity organizations cooperating with HTS.[5] A New Level in the Cyber War between Israel and Iran[29] In cyber warfare, an attack on essential civilian infrastructure is considered a serious attack. According to media reports, Iran attacked Israel's water infrastructure, and Israel responded with a cyberattack against infrastructure at the Iranian port in Bandar Abbas. While these were not the first attacks between the two countries, they illustrate that the conflict theater includes essential civilian infrastructure. Israel has so far managed to deal with cyberattacks against civilian infrastructure without suffering much damage, but it may become more vulnerable as the cyber arms race accelerates and Iran gains more sophisticated capabilities. Israel must assume that in the cyber realm, there will be further and more sophisticated attempts to attack than those that have been seen thus far.Cyber warfare is conducted secretly and anonymously, unless one of the sides in the confrontation has an interest in exposing it. The attacks are generally launched without claiming responsibility or with denying responsibility, if at all ascribed. In the vast majority of cases, identifying the source of the attack is difficult. Attacks in cyberspace are considered to suit a ""campaign between wars,"" since they enable the attacker to operate from afar, secretly, and avoid human casualties on both sides in order to avoid escalation. Cyberattacks allow information collection to enable cognitive warfare, send deterrent messages, increase pressure on military and civilian systems in order to achieve defense and political goals, and launch preventive actions. The Stuxnet attack against Iran's nuclear facilities, which was revealed in 2010, was a formative event regarding military cyberattacks on infrastructure. The attack on the command and control systems of essential civilian infrastructure is considered to be at a high level on the scale of seriousness of cyberattacks. The most serious attacks of this sort are those that endanger large civilian populations, for instance due to water pollution or accidents that result from attacks on transportation systems.According to reports in the American media, Iran and Israel have exchanged blows in cyberspace, attacking each other's civilian targets. Israel reportedly launched a cyberattack on May 9, 2020 against the Iranian port at the Shahid Raja'i port in Bandar Abbas in southern Iran, in response to an Iranian cyberattack against water and sewage infrastructure ('the water system') in Israel.The attack against the Israeli water system attributed to Iran was carried out at a number of points throughout the country on April 24 and 25, 2020 (before Israel's Independence Day and at the start of the first stage of the exit from the coronavirus lockdown). At one facility, there were unusual data and 'irregularities.' At another, a pump was disconnected from automatic mode (controlled) and put into continual operation, and at another water source, the operating system was taken over (Ynet, May 19). In one of the cases, the water pump stopped operating for a short time. The concern, presented by the National Cyber Directorate, was that during the coronavirus crisis, Israel would be forced to deal with a temporary lack of water, or with a mixture of chlorine or other chemicals at the incorrect balance, which could have caused damage to the point of a disaster. The Iranians are slowly realizing that if &#38; when the US triggers the snapback mechanism in UNSCR 2231 Russia and China will grudgingly go along because preserving Article 41 is more important to them than helping Iran, and so Tehran has no good options. https://t.co/uRYoeM7nNB[30] — Omri Ceren (@omriceren) June 6, 2020[31] Is Longtime Pro-Israel Congressman Eliot Engel in Trouble?[32] Longtime Rep. Eliot Engel (D-NY) is having a rough week. First, the pro-Israel Jewish lawmaker was caught in a hot-mic moment on Tuesday, and on Wednesday fellow New York Democratic congresswoman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) endorsed his progressive primary opponent, Jamaal Bowman, who has questioned the US-Israel relationship.With comparisons already being made to Ocasio-Cortez's stunning upset of former Rep. Joe Crowley in 2018, is Engel's job in Congress in jeopardy as voters head to the polls on June 23 for primaries?'Eliot Engel is a champion of the working people of New York and is one of the most effective members of Congress from any district when it comes to taking care of their constituents,' Josh Block, a former aide to President Bill Clinton and former head of The Israel Project, told JNS.On Tuesday, Engel came under fire for a hot-mic moment, saying: 'If I didn't have a primary, I wouldn't care.'The remark was made at a news conference with local and state officials in which Engel asked to speak about the instability in his Bronx district over the death of George Floyd, 46, who died on May 25 in the custody of Minneapolis police. Bronx Borough President Rubn Daz Jr. told Engel that there wouldn't be time for him to speak and, in response to Engel's 'I wouldn't care' comment, said, 'We're not politicizing. Everybody's got a primary, you know?'In a statement later Tuesday, Engel said, 'In the context of running for re-election, I thought it was important for people to know where I stand, that's why I asked to speak. I would not have tried to impose on the Borough President if I didn't think it was important.'Engel, who heads the powerful House Foreign Affairs Committee, has served in Congress since 1989 and represents the heavily Democratic New York 16th congressional district, which currently contains parts of the Bronx and Westchester County. Yet over the decades that Engel has served, redistricting and demographics have led to significant changes in composition of Engel's district, which today is minority-majority, with black and Hispanics making up over 55 percent of its residents.Israeli BDS activist seeking asylum in Canada will be deported back to Israel[33] An Israeli activist who had tried to claim asylum in Canada as a refugee is getting deported back to Israel, Rabble.ca reports, after he exhausted his last court appeal in December.;Gilad Paz, 38, who identifies as part of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel, has been living in Montreal since 2016. A self-employed lawyer before leaving Israel who was also active in Amnesty International Israel and the left-wing Meretz Party, Paz claimed he was seeking asylum in Canada because he feared being 'politically persecuted' in Israel.In 2017, Israel passed a law that denies entry into the country for activists who support the BDS movement, though this does not apply to Israelis.After Paz settled in Montreal, Israel's then Consul General, Ziv Nevo Kulman, dismissed his refugee claim as 'preposterous.'Canada's Border Services Agency is not moving to make him leave immediately, due to travel restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic. When I was in Israel I saw those activists in the streets, they didn't look scared at all, they know they live in a democracy. — Sarai (Sarah Idan) Miss Iraq (@RealSarahIdan) June 6, 2020[34] Dog whistle from @QuincyInst[35] ('Responsible Statecraft') targeting @NYTOpinion[36]'s Adam Rubenstein.

Army Tests Israeli ""Smart Scope"" Designed to Kill Drones[46] Images of U.S. soldiers in the Syrian desert training with an advanced electronic aiming system on their rifles have offered the first indication that the Israeli-made device was being field tested by the U.S. military.The photos — posted on the Defense Visual Information Distribution Service — showed special operators at the al-Tanf base in southern Syria using the Smart Shooter SMASH 2000 sighting system mounted on their M4A1 carbines. They were shown firing on range targets and also at a box in the air suspended below a small drone.The small arms fire control system allows the shooter to select a target and lock on while pressing the trigger, according to the Israeli manufacturer Smart Shooter.But the electro-optical system — which includes image recognition software — blocks the action until the firing solution can guarantee a hit, when it automatically activates the trigger. It can be used in daylight and at night.Smart Shooter, which has paired with German firearms maker Sig Sauer to offer its system to the U.S. and other militaries, said that the system allows any firearm — including machine guns and assault rifles — to be used to destroy flying drones.Israeli's crowdfunding effort seeks to save forests by buying a piece of them[47] The constant drip of bad news about the environment can be paralyzing and the sheer multiplicity of 'World Days' for every animal and subject under the sun confusing and overwhelming.It's hard to know where to start to do one's bit for the natural world.That was the feeling of Uri Shanas, who earned a PhD in zoology from Tel Aviv University, completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Columbia University and then joined the Department of Biology and Environment at the University of Haifa-Oranim.'Around 20 years ago, I started to teach a course on nature preservation,' he told The Times of Israel ahead of Friday's United Nations World Environment Day.'Year after year, I taught the course and when you teach, you also get to understand more. I was shocked at the pace of extinction and at some stage, I started to think, hang on, it's not logical that I should teach without doing anything about it.'The result, many years later, was TIME - This Is My Earth — which, to the best of Shanas's knowledge, is the world's first international, democratic, volunteer-based, crowdfunded, nonprofit organization geared to buying land where biodiversity is rich but threats are imminent.It costs a minimum of $1 per year to join the organization and to get to vote on which threatened habitat should be saved.Individuals and organizations from overseas wishing to acquire land for environmental preservation have to fill out detailed forms and go through intense vetting by a scientific advisory board of international experts.Three projects are put up on TIME's website each year to be voted on. Each vote carries the same weight, no matter how much each member has contributed. The money raised is then split, pro rata, between the projects, according to the proportion of votes, but if not enough money has been raised to buy land for the less popular projects, it either waits until the minimum sum has been reached or goes into the pot for a project chosen by the majority.

MARK ETHERIDGE A highly respected curator at St Fagan's National Museum of History, Mark has been responsible for the museum's LGBT+ collections, uncovering hidden LGBT+ significance and collecting contemporary LGBT+ lives and culture.
The past 18 months have seen Mark making a conscious effort to build trusting relationships with groups such as Glitter Cymru, collecting their banner and oral history recordings from members to ensure minority members of the LGBT+ community are featured in the national collection.
During lockdown, Mark has been working to document the once-in-a-lifetime virtual Welsh Pride events for the museum's Covid-19 collection.
A member of Oral History Society's LGBT+ Special Interest Group, Mark recently gave a talk on queer voices from the St Fagans Archive.
RUDY HARRIES Rudy is a fairly new activist on the scene, having started campaigning to raise awareness of the astronomical rates of homelessness among LGBT+ youth last summer alongside Michael Sheen at the Homeless World Cup.
In addition to working on a master's degree at Cardiff University, he's been running a successful meet-up group for trans, non-binary and intersex people in Cardiff and the Valleys.
When the UK Government announced hesitancy in reforming the Gender Recognition Act, Rudy and his friends set up a socially-distanced protest outside Cardiff Castle.
Since then, he and a team of fellow workingclass trans people have set up CTN (Cardiff Trans and NonBinary) Mutual Aid Network, which aims to get the material needs of poor trans people met. To date, CTN Mutual Aid has redistributed £2,000 from cisgender allies to struggling trans, nonbinary and intersex people.
Rudy is currently working in the team of trans people working with the Welsh Government to ensure trans people's rights are protected.

By Kelli Jo Ford
There’s a scene in Kelli Jo Ford’s first novel that tugged at me long after I finished her book.
In it, a depressed, defeated man stands in a North Texas pasture watching his horses nibble at a round bale of hay. As his wife watches from their trailer home, a gust of wind kicks up, obscuring him in a thick cloud of dust, hay and grasshoppers. When it settles, the frantic horses are racing along the fence line, but her husband just stands there “with his arms out, like he was waiting to be carried away.”
I also yearned to be carried away, to be lifted out of the daily grind, as I read “Crooked Hallelujah” — not just because of the anxious moments our country is living through but because that’s what good fiction does: It transports us. Ford’s novel, however, rolls about like a tumbleweed buffeted by desert breezes, meandering aimlessly around thorny issues of intergenerational poverty and female despair but never quite launching into a satisfying story or even providing a convincing case for mediocrity.
“Crooked Hallelujah” is about three generations of Oklahoma women with Cherokee blood in their veins and a penchant for no-good men — adulterers, slackers, violent and self-absorbed cads who abandon wives and children at will.
The book opens in 1974 with 15-year-old Justine and her mom, Lula, living with Lula’s mother in Oklahoma. Seven years earlier, Justine’s dad dropped Lula and his three daughters off at church, drained their bank account and drove out of their lives forever. As a result, Lula is forced to drop out of college and give up her dreams of becoming an artist to work as a secretary. The family scrapes by on powdered commodity eggs, while Lula doubles down on the stifling dogma of her Holiness church, which keeps women in ankle-length skirts and out of leadership roles and condemns teenagers for attending rock concerts or, God forbid, going on a trip to Six Flags.
But teens do what teens are wont to do: They find ways to sample forbidden secularities anyway, and their unfamiliarity with concepts such as designated drivers or birth control often brings tragic results. Unsurprisingly, Justine, eager to liberate herself from this religious straitjacket, sneaks out of her bedroom window and into the pickup truck of a 20-something man she has only recently met. She imagines them going to a drive-in movie, and by the time she notices a blanket folded in his back seat, she has started down a path toward teenage motherhood and a series of bad choices that will consign her to the same hardscrabble life as her mother.
“Don’t ever be like me,” she’ll later tell Reney, the child she conceived that night. Therein lies the main tension of the book: whether Reney will break the hereditary curse of general wretchedness.
The chapters shift between the experiences of Lulu, Justine, Reney and a few peripheral characters. These secondary characters outshine the three women because they are more complex and surprising. In a long section dropped into the middle of the book, for example, Ford introduces a lesbian couple and their mentally disabled 26-year-old neighbor, Mose, who’s left to fend for himself after his mother dies. After the women are savagely attacked by “meth heads” in a home-invasion hate crime, the section ends abruptly with Mose running toward the home of that “sailor-mouthed Indian lady” (Justine) for help. Aside from a passing reference some 50 pages later, we learn no more about this dynamic, tender trio — or why they are in the book at all.
In another gripping interlude, an aging cowboy brings home a woman he picked up at a rodeo to meet his bedridden wife. He draws the woman from the rodeo a bath and helps her undress, but, after hearing his wife cough in the next room, is unable to bed her. “I don’t tell the tale to rectify the situation or to say I’m sorry, I done wrong,” he mournfully reflects. “I tell it to say that sometimes all the years and tears don’t amount to nothing but a slow death upon you.”
The slow death of this novel can be traced to one fatal flaw: Its main characters are boring. They cling to soul-shredding creeds and rancid men and exhibit an infuriating lack of agency. Instead of evolving in dramatic or profound ways, they remain passive and long-suffering. As a consequence, the story fails to move the reader.
Toward the end of “Crooked Hallelujah,” Ford implies that education and reason is the antidote to these thwarted female lives. After a brief marriage to a violent man, Reney seems poised to change her fate when she moves to Portland to study literature and falls in love with “a nice man with soft hands and letters after his name.”
The novel concludes with a disjointed 30-page section on apocalyptic forces of nature scouring Texas, but I’d rather end on this focused and hopeful note. Perhaps a brighter future awaits for at least one of these pitiful women.

Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) is coming under fire for a series of tweets criticized as being anti-Semitic. 
On Sunday, when commenting &#111n the nomination of Tony Blinken as Secretary of State, Tlaib wrote, ""So long as he doesn't suppress my First Amendment right to speak out against Netanyahu's racist and inhumane policies. The Palestinian people deserve equality and justice.""

Several Twitter users criticized Tlaib""s tweets as being anti-Semitic, including writer Hen Mazzig who wrote, ""If a Jewish American politician tweeted this, they would be immediately accused of being more loyal to Israel than the people they represent&hellipby Rashida Tlaib."" 
Former New York Democratic Assemblyman Dov Hikind ripped Tlaib as well and wrote, ""Biden names a Jew to his cabinet. What""s Rashida""s response?!

The police believe the victims were chosen at random, but they are not treating the rampage as terrorism.
A search was underway in Birmingham, England, on Sunday for a man who was said to have carried out a series of stabbings across the city that left at least one person dead and seven more wounded, two of them seriously, the police said.
The police have shared images and video footage of the man thought to be responsible for what the police said appeared to be a “random attack.” 
Chief Superintendent Steve Graham of the West Midlands Police said that officers were still searching for a motive, but that there was no indication the stabbings were related to terrorism, a hate crime or gang violence.
The police have confirmed that at least one man was killed and that two people, a man and a woman, had serious injuries. Five others were also wounded, and their injuries were described as minor.
No link has been established among the victims, leading the police to believe that the stabbings were done at random.
They declared the situation a “major incident,” a designation that describes any episode involving serious harm or a security risk to the public. A murder investigation has been opened.
The attacks happened in several spots across central Birmingham, a city about 120 miles northwest of London. The first was reported to the police shortly after midnight in the north of the city, and the others followed over the next few hours, ending in an area known for its busy nightlife. The police said they believed that the stabbings were linked and that one man was responsible for the crimes.
“We are doing everything we can to trace the offender,” Superintendent Graham said at a news conference. 
Video footage of the suspect taken from surveillance cameras was released by the West Midlands Police on Sunday evening as they appealed to the public to help in identifying the man. 
The police have urged anyone who was in the city center late Saturday or early Sunday to share information, photographs or video related to the attacks.
The video of the suspected attacker matches descriptions given by witnesses to some of the incidents. 
A witness to one stabbing told Sky News that he had seen a man wearing a black hooded sweatshirt and a cap stabbing a woman in the neck several times. The man evaded attempts by other witnesses to chase him.
“It happened very quickly,” the witness, Savvas Sfrantziz, a bar owner in the nightlife area, told Sky News. “He just went up to her and just stabbed her. I’ve never seen anything like it.”
David Nash, who runs another bar in the same area, said that as the bars were closing around 2 a.m., he saw someone in a hooded top walking down the street and heard someone shout, “Stop him — he’s just stabbed somebody!”
“Then, of course, this person took off into the night,” Mr. Nash told BBC News. The area was soon overrun by emergency vehicles, he added.
The police have urged Birmingham residents to be alert, warning that the attacker was still at large, and they promised to increase the presence of uniformed and armed officers within the city center on Sunday.
“Our emergency services are working hard to find whoever is responsible and bring them to justice,” Britain’s home secretary, Priti Patel, said on Twitter.
The country’s foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said it was “a very serious incident” and urged anyone in the area to “be vigilant.”
David Jamieson, the West Midlands police and crime commissioner, said, “We’re well used on a Friday and Saturday night to activity, but I think what is different is the randomness of this particular event.”
Serious violent crime, including stabbings, has risen sharply in Britain in recent years. While gun crime is a rare occurrence compared with the United States, Britain has faced a large increase in knife crime.
Six people, including a police officer, were injured in Glasgow, Scotland, in late June amid a stabbing attack in a hotel. Days earlier, three people were killed and three others injured in a stabbing at a park in Reading, England, in what the authorities described as a terrorist incident.

There's a scene in Kelli Jo Ford's first novel that tugged at me long after I finished her book. 
 In it, a depressed, defeated man stands in a North Texas pasture watching his horses nibble at a round bale of hay. As his wife watches from their trailer home, a gust of wind kicks up, obscuring him in a thick cloud of dust, hay and grasshoppers. When it settles, the frantic horses are racing along the fence line, but her husband just stands there ''with his arms out, like he was waiting to be carried away.''

For American Jewry this year's presidential election is without question the most critical one ever. Over the past four years, anti-Semitism has become an undeniable, and central characteristic of the Democrat Party to which the vast majority of American Jews have pledged their loyalty for the better part of the past hundred years while anti-Semitism in the Republican Party has dropped to historic lows. Democrat anti-Semitism has seemingly appeared out of the blue but in truth, the party has been on a largely one-lane road to radicalization for the past fifty years. 
It's just that the path turned into a highway over the past four years with the rise of open anti-Semites like Rashida Tlaib, Linda Sarsour, Andre Carson, Keith Ellison and Ilhan Omert to commanding positions in the party. Anti-Semitism runs through Democrat politics, policies and behavior across a spectrum of issues. In foreign policy, hating Israel has become the most passionate position of the progressive grassroots. Biden announced early on that if elected, he will restore the US's commitment to the Iran nuclear deal he forged with Barack Obama. That means that a Biden administration will cancel the economic sanctions on Iran, ensuring the survival of the regime. It means a Biden administration will enable the cessation of the UN arms embargo enabling Iran to purchase whatever advanced weapons systems it wants. It also means a regime pledged to annihilate the largest Jewish community in the world - Israel - will have an open path to a nuclear arsenal. Biden has agreed to restore the Palestinians to center stage. This isn't a pro-peace position. After all, the Abraham accords are the result of Trump marginalizing the Palestinians. The purpose of a Palestinian-centric policy is it is to delegitimize Israel, justify a US foreign policy that is hostile to Israel and domestic policy that is hostile to Israel's supporters in America. Then there is anti-Semitism itself. The good news is that like Trump, Biden can be expected to take on white supremacists. The bad news is that in stark contrast to Trump, Biden can be expected to turn a blind eye to the growing anti-Semitism in his own political camp.Cynical Theories - a review[2]'Cynical Theories - how universities made everything about race, gender, and identity and why this harms everybody.' By Helen Pluckrose and James Lindsay The word cynical, in the title of the book, is deliberate; the authors assert that many of the ideas informing the theories are pessimistic, rejecting objective truth and modernity. Radical skepticism about modernity is a defining feature. There is a sense of hopelessness and a preoccupation with the superficial. The authors deem these key features 'reactionary'. (The theories are also often characterised by obscurity of language. *) The authors suggest that universities , and academia, are sites in which the theories are mainly located, and are significant generators of activism and intolerance. Scholarship and rigorous research are tainted by the cynical theories, open debate is stifled. This has affected a wide range of studies including STEM subjects. And 'what happens in universities doesn't stay in the universities'. The book comprises 10 chapters dealing with interrelated topics such as CRT and Intersectionality, Postcolonial theory, Feminism and Gender studies, and explores what I call the heavy stuff originating in the 1960s - Foucault, Lyotard, Derrida, etc - whilst later chapters consider ways in which the theories have shaped the debate in subjects such as Queer theory and Fat studies. Of particular interest are two chapters on Social Justice scholarship, thought, and action. Whilst a concern for justice in society is necessary, social class - previously considered an important topic - is rarely considered by the theory. Instead it 'seeks to apply deconstructive methods and postmodern principles to the task of creating social change'. Theory and activism are based on the assumption that racism and bigotry are everywhere, consequently there is a preoccupation with, and elevation of, victimhood. There is no room for criticism: disagreement is interpreted as a sign of intellectual and moral failure. There is 'little time for universal principles and individual intellectual diversity'. (h/t L King)Religion, Science, and the Religion of Science[3]New York's scapegoated Haredi communities appear to be the last Americans capable of maintaining a sane balance between science and faith Like, say, the idea of science. If you believe in it—truly, deeply, and unequivocally—you understand that science isn't a faith-based system. It cares little for politics or virtues. It's a blissfully agnostic methodology that makes guesses, compares them with available evidence, and amends, alters, or rejects them based on results. So, if you're being true to science, say, here's how you should be thinking about public gatherings: Are they unsafe? Then they're as unsafe for the proponents of Black Lives just as they are for the Satmars. Are they safe under some conditions? Then let us be clear about precisely what these conditions are. Take, for example, Gov. Cuomo's decree that no more than 10 people are allowed in a house of worship at any given time. If you possess even a modicum of common sense, you realize that this idea is, at its core, profoundly anti-scientific, as it has nothing to say about the size of the house of worship in question. Ten people in a small one-room shtiebel is a real risk; 10 people in a grand synagogue built to seat thousands is a real farce. A governor serious about science and public safety rather than about seizing power would've understood that and acted accordingly, offering guidelines that were sensible and measured and concrete. The only ones pointing out this travesty are the Haredim. It's of little surprise, then, that the main flag on view during the Haredi protests last week was the Gadsden flag. Don't Tread on Me, that quintessentially American cri de coeur, is, these days, primarily the domain of the Haredi community. Everywhere else in the Jewish world, the slogans recited are the confused and exhausted and meaningless truisms of nice liberals who can't or don't care to explain the staggering contradictions, violations, hypocrisies, and usurpations committed with their tacit support. Flatten the curve, wear a mask, close the shuls—all were accepted without too much attention to detail or rationale and without asking what, in effect, we're risking when we sign away so many of our freedoms to officials who seem to have nothing but the vaguest grasp on science and democracy alike. There's nothing less Jewish, or less American, than that. The Haredim understand that by succumbing to the tyranny of illogic, the sort that restricts attendance regardless of the size of the venue or deems one form of gathering acceptable but not another, all will be lost. To surrender thusly would be a total disruption of their Jewish and American way of life. Their critics, sadly, prefer instead to worship at a very different altar, sanctifying their leftist bona fides and reverence to leaders from the correct political party rather than asking hard but obvious questions. What we see in Brooklyn these days, then, is nothing less than a religious war, in which the Haredim, in a delicious twist of fate, have actual science on their side. Here's hoping they prevail.https://tablet-mag-images.b-cdn.net/production/92c6476eecd762ca02d5df78ad9182b07556431a-3097x4645.jpg?w=1250&#38;q=70&#38;auto=format&#38;dpr=1 France knife attacker asked pupils to point out his victim[4]The 18-year-old who beheaded a history teacher outside the school in France where he taught had approached pupils in the street and asked them to point out his victim, anti-terrorist prosecutor Jean-Francois Ricard said on Saturday. Speaking at a news conference, Ricard also said that the Russian-born attacker, after beheading the teacher, had posted a photograph of the teacher's body on Twitter, accompanied by a message saying he had carried out the killing. Police shot the attacker dead minutes after he murdered 47-year-old history teacher Samuel Paty on Friday. The killing shocked the country and carried echoes of an attack five years ago on the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. Investigators were seeking to establish whether the attacker had acted alone or had accomplices. French media reported that he was an 18-year-old of Chechen origin. Paty had earlier this month shown his pupils cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad in a civics class on freedom of expression, angering a number of Muslim parents. Muslims believe that any depiction of the Prophet is blasphemous. Prime Minister Jean Castex said the attack bore the hallmarks of Islamist terrorism.Beheaded French teacher was threatened online for showing Mohammed cartoons[5]A history teacher beheaded in a Paris suburb on Friday had been the target of online threats for having shown pupils cartoons of the Muslim prophet Mohammed in class, France's anti-terror prosecutor said on Saturday. The father of a schoolgirl had sought 47-year-old teacher Samuel Paty's dismissal and launched an online call for 'mobilization' against him after the lesson on freedom of expression, Jean-Franois Ricard said in a televised news conference. Paty was decapitated outside his school in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, northwest of the capital, and the killer was fatally wounded by police. Ricard identified the attacker as Abdullakh A., an 18-year-old Chechen with refugee status in France. Nine people, including the schoolgirl's father, have been arrested. Ricard said the school received threats after the class in early October, which featured the controversial caricatures — one of the prophet naked — with the girl's father accusing Paty of disseminating 'pornography'. The girl and her father lodged a criminal complaint against the teacher, who in turn filed a complaint of defamation, said Ricard. Yesterday a teacher in France was hacked - slaughtered because he 'blasphemed'.This is not the first attack and Radical Islamists are imposing Islamic blasphemy law (death) in France.It does not matter what Macron says - teachers in France all just got the message. — David Collier (@mishtal) October 17, 2020[6] 'You will pay:' Paris kosher market suspect warns police witness during trial[7]The main suspect in the trial of alleged accomplices in the 2015 Paris terror attacks caused an uproar in court Friday when he threatened a policewoman during her testimony. 'You will pay for this,' shouted Ali Riza Polat, who is believed to have been the right-hand man of Amedy Coulibaly, who killed a police officer in January 2015 and the next day shot dead four people at a Jewish supermarket, before being killed by police. The threat came as the witness, a policewoman working in an anti-terror unit, gave the court her account of Polat's conversion to radical Islamism. She said that Polat 'shared the religious convictions of his friend Amedy Coulibaly' and recounted a conversation between Polat's mother and a friend recorded in a wiretap. The mother, the police agent said, told the friend that Polat had called her an 'unbeliever' and 'perverse'. From behind the glass screen of the defendants' box, Polat raised his fist several times, mimicking punches at the agent during her testimony, and was called to order by the court. Chief prosecutor Jean-Michel Bourles, calling Polat's outburst 'a scandal,' said he would file criminal charges against him for 'threats against a person testifying on behalf of the public authorities'. Vile response to murder of French teacher[8]If I didn't know Roshan Salih was the editor of 5Pillars and reporter for Press TV, I'd strongly suspect he was a fabrication dreamed up by some far right fanatic to whip up anger against Muslims. This was his disgraceful response to the murder of Samuel Paty, the teacher who was decapitated outside his school after showing cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad as part of a civic education class. http://hurryupharry.org /wp-content/uploads/2020/10/RS-300x297.png;In an earlier tweet in response to the same atrocity he said: France is heading down a v dark path. The oppression &#38; brutalisation of Muslims is completely out of control. And the terrible violence seems set to continue.If you didn't know the context you'd probably assume the 'terrible violence' had been some kind of Islamophobic attack. On a quite different note, you don't have to agree with the MCB's Miqdaad Versi on all issues to find his own response to the murder quite unexceptionable. Two headlines, one story pic.twitter.com/5d4i9ivIg1[9] — Orwell &#38; Goode (@OrwellNGoode) October 16, 2020[10] ;Jewish Congregations Challenge 'Blatantly Antisemitic' New York Coronavirus Restrictions[11]Three Jewish congregations on Thursday filed a lawsuit claiming that New York's coronavirus restrictions on public gatherings violated their First Amendment religious rights under the US Constitution. The lawsuit, filed in US District Court in Manhattan by Congregations Oholei Shem D'nitra, Netzach Yisroel and Yesheos Yakov asked the state's measures, which restricted religious gatherings to as few as 10 people, be overturned. The restrictions were described by the lawsuit as being 'blatantly anti-Semitic.'To avoid the charge of anti-Semitism, New York needs to make its COVID crackdown standards clearer[12]The problem is that the state has not made clear exactly what that means. What benchmark metrics — that is, what numbers — over what geographic area constitutes a cluster subject to the new regulations? Consider, as a contrast, California's current regulations. In California, counties are placed in a color-coded tier based upon an adjusted case rate and positivity rate. The state is quite clear what benchmarks a county needs to hit before the state will loosen COVID-19 health restrictions. New York, however, has not provided analogous rules in its official documents or statements; they do not appear in Cuomo's executive order, nor in the state's briefing in federal court. This failure certainly makes it hard to determine whether the state is applying the same restrictions to other neighborhoods that it is applying to predominantly ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods. Failure to apply these same restrictions to all neighborhoods with comparable positivity rates — to engage in something akin to religious gerrymandering — would raise serious concerns as to whether the state is singling out particular Jewish communities for discriminatory treatment. The state's lack of clear metrics is not evidence that the state has targeted Jewish communities. But if the state is going to be successful in its attempt to convince the impacted Jewish communities that they are getting a fair shake — that decisions are being made based on numbers and not politics — then it has to do a better job explaining what those numbers are and how its 'science-based' decision-making works. Ultimately, these new restrictions do not exist in a vacuum. They come on the heels of a summer where Mayor de Blasio unnecessarily politicized COVID-19 restrictions. As I've expressed previously, in choosing to justify the disparate treatment of racial justice protests and houses of worship on political grounds — and not on far more reasonable public health grounds — De Blasio cemented in the minds of many faith communities that ongoing COVID-19 regulations were not just about health and safety. Those missteps have already served as grounds for a federal court to strike down some of New York's public health guidelines — a consequence that puts all New Yorkers at risk. Undoing the damage of these early missteps will require the state to go above and beyond when it formulates new restrictions, especially those that disparately disadvantage religious communities. There is no room any more for ambiguity. Ambiguity only feeds into a festering narrative of distrust. Indeed, if the state is unable to convince faith communities that its restrictions are intended to protect them instead of punish them, it is hard to see how it will be successful in securing compliance.Israel , Bahrain to sign joint declaration in step toward full peace agreement[13]Israel is set to move forward with its recently inked normalization agreements with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain this week, with a delegation from Jerusalem set to travel to Manama and a delegation from the UAE visiting the Jewish state for the first time for talks on economic cooperation. The Israeli delegation heading to Manama on Sunday will make history by taking the first-ever commercial nonstop flight from Israel to the Gulf kingdom. Ben Gurion Airport departure listings show El Al Flight 973, the same number as Bahrain's international telephone code, Reuters reported. However, Manama is also slowing the pace of proceedings toward the signing of a full-fledged peace deal, the Walla news site reported Friday, with the kingdom preferring to sign 'a joint communique on establishing peaceful and diplomatic relations,' stopping short of the full normalization agreement signed between Israel and the UAE. According to the Walla report, also published on the US Axios news site, the Bahrainis want to move forward more cautiously than the UAE due to some domestic opposition to the move. Nevertheless, the communique was still considered to be progress and expands on the initial declaration signed in Washington. 'The aim of the communique is to start implementing the declaration which was signed in Washington, put more meat into it, make it more detailed and define the principles of the relations between the countries,' an official told Walla. 'It will be the umbrella for all bilateral agreements to be signed in the next several months,' the unnamed official said. Mnuchin to lead Israeli-American delegation to UAE and Bahrain[14]US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin will lead an American-Israeli delegation to the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain to move forward with Jerusalem's recently inked normalization agreements with the Gulf states, the US Treasury said on Friday. The delegation will leave Israel on Saturday, and the trip will wrap up on Tuesday, the statement said. The group will first visit the Bahraini capital of Manama, then proceed to Abu Dhabi, capital of the UAE, before returning to Israel. Avi Berkowitz, the US administration's envoy to the Middle East, and US Ambassador to Israel David Friedman, will also join the trip, along with other US Treasury and embassy officials. The trip will 'support expanded economic cooperation under the Abraham Accords signed by the three countries last month,' the Treasury statement said. The Israeli delegation heading to Manama will make history by taking the first-ever commercial nonstop flight from Israel to the Gulf kingdom. Ben Gurion Airport departure listings show El Al Flight 973, the same number as Bahrain's international telephone code, Reuters reported. The return flight will be the first direct commercial flight between Tel Aviv and Abu Dhabi. Citizens of Arab countries hunger for democracy, survey finds[15]A vast majority of citizens of Arab countries support democracy and pluralism, according to a new opinion poll conducted in 13 Arab countries by the Qatar-based Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies. The 2019-20 Arab Opinion Index, which can be read here[16] in full, used 900 researchers to survey nearly 30,000 individuals, asked Arab citizens for their opinions about local and global issues, including Israeli-Arab relations and the Nov. 3 US presidential election. A large majority - 76% -- of respondents expressed support for a democratic system of government, and 74% said that they thought a ""pluralist"" democratic system would be an appropriate form of government for their countries. Support for existing governments was weaker, with only 47% of respondents saying that they thought their governments were carrying out their duties. An overwhelming 91% said that they believed that financial and administrative corruption existed in their countries, to varying degrees. Nearly a decade after the Arab Spring of 2011, how do residents of Arab countries feel about those events? According to the poll, 58% saw the revolutions and protests of 2011 as ""very"" or ""somewhat"" positive, in spite of developments since then. Nearly half (48%) said that the Arab Spring movement still faced obstacles but believed its goals would ultimately be achieved. Despite the recent decisions by the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain to normalize ties with Israel, much of the Arab public apparently remains unmoved when it comes to the Jewish state. A whopping 88% of respondents refused to recognize Israel, mostly for political reasons rather than religious ones. A majority of respondents from Saudi Arabia (65%) rejected recognition of Israel, despite some changes in Saudi policy, such as allowing Israeli flights to make use of its airspace. The ACRPS report noted a ""high rate of non-response"" (29%) from Saudis, given ""current conditions of repression.""With new Hebrew website, Etihad Airways readies for launch of direct UAE flights[17]The United Arab Emirates' Etihad Airways this week launched a Hebrew-language website amid high hopes for burgeoning tourist and business trade in the wake of a full normalization agreement signed between Israel and the UAE last month. The message 'Welcome from Abu Dhabi' greets users as they enter the website, with different sections on safety protocols and other destinations offered by the airline also appearing in Hebrew. Direct flights were set to begin this month, but an Israeli official on Tuesday said they will be postponed until January because of the coronavirus. Israel's Transportation Ministry director-general Ofer Malka told Army Radio that he expected an aviation deal to be signed in the coming days, adding that there was also work being done to ensure the safety of Israeli travelers. 'In the coming days, we will sign the aviation agreement with the United Arab Emirates. We are also working on the security aspect, approving the fields there for the arrival and departure of Israelis,' Malka said. In a statement on Wednesday, Transportation Minister Miri Regev said Israel and the UAE are working hard to get direct flights between the countries off the ground. Israeli carrier Israir announced last month that it will also begin offering direct flights from Ben Gurion Airport to Abu Dhabi. Israeli national carrier El Al will also reportedly offer flights on the route. Palestinians accuse Gulf visitors of 'desecrating' Al-Aqsa Mosque[18]A recent visit by Gulf Arabs to al-Aqsa Mosque has sparked outrage among east Jerusalem residents and the Palestinian ruling Fatah faction, who accused the visitors of promoting normalization with Israel and 'desecrating' the holy site. Palestinians initially claimed that the visitors were from Oman. Later, however, they said the delegation members who prayed at the mosque were from the United Arab Emirates. In August, the UAE became the third Arab country, after Egypt and Jordan, to agree to formally normalize its relationship with Israel. The Palestinian leadership has condemned the deal, accusing the UAE of backstabbing the Palestinians and betraying the Palestinian issue, al-Aqsa Mosque and Jerusalem. The Omani government on Saturday denied that any of its citizens had visited or prayed at al-Aqsa. A government official in Oman was quoted as saying that no Omani delegation had made an official visit to Jerusalem, adding that his country's position toward the Palestinian issue is 'clear.' Eyewitnesses said the Emirati delegation entered al-Aqsa compound 'under Israeli police protection.' The delegation consisted of nine men and one woman, they said, adding that the Wakf Department was not notified in advance of the visit. Shadi Mtour, a Fatah leader from east Jerusalem, accused the Gulf visitors of 'storming al-Aqsa Mosque,' a phrase regularly used by Palestinians to describe tours by Jews to the Temple Mount. You know you've made it when you've upgraded from visiting to storming. https://t.co/o5QAI2F0pB[19] — The Mossad: Zionists and Loving It (@TheMossadIL) October 16, 2020[20] Israel records 26 new virus deaths as lockdown to ease Sunday[21]Israel recorded 26 new coronavirus deaths over the past 30 hours, according to Health Ministry figures published Saturday evening, even as the number of daily new virus cases and the share of those found positive have continued to decline ahead of a partial reopening of the economy on Sunday. The lifting of some restrictions will come after a four-week national lockdown. According to the Health Ministry, 1,469 people were diagnosed on Friday out of a total of 34,640 tests performed over the course of the day, a positive rate of 4.2 percent. This followed a positive rate of 4.5% on Thursday, with 1,608 new cases diagnosed out of 37,487 tests on Thursday. These were some of the lowest rates since July. Meanwhile, the government was reported to be considering removing restrictions from all cities Sunday — including those with high infection rates that officials had planned to keep under closure. With over 302,000 coronavirus cases since the start of the pandemic, Israel currently has 35,212 active cases, including 689 in serious condition, 238 of whom are on ventilators. Another 210 virus patients are in moderate condition, with the rest displaying mild or no symptoms. The death toll, meanwhile, stood at 2,167 as of Saturday evening. The latest figures match the government's goal of reaching under 2,000 daily cases before easing some lockdown restrictions on Sunday. Palestinians in Gaza fire rocket into Israel, no injuries[22]Palestinian terrorists in the Gaza Strip fired a rocket into Israel on Friday evening, the IDF said. The projectile apparently exploded in an open field, with no reports of damage or injuries. Rocket sirens were set off southern Israeli town of Netiv Ha'asara just north of the Gaza Strip, sending thousands in the vicinity to bomb shelters for the second time this month. In an unusual move, there were no reports of retaliatory strikes on targets in Gaza. It was the first rocket attack since October 5, when another single rocket was fired, without causing casualties or damage. In response, Israeli aircraft struck a Hamas military installation in the southern Gaza Strip in retaliation. Prior to that, the last cross-border rocket attack — after which Israel retaliated with air raids — came on September 15 and coincided with the signing in Washington of normalization deals between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. Iran sentences men accused of being involved in robbery to amputation[23]Iran's courts earlier this week sentenced three men who were caught stealing to amputation, Kurdistan Human Rights Network (KHRN) and Fox News reported. Two of the prisoners, Mehrdad Teymouri, 30, and his brother, Shahab Teymouri, 35, were reportedly arrested in April 2019 and found guilty for taking part in several robberies in the area. Their appeals were dismissed by the court earlier this week. They are currently awaiting punishment, which includes having four fingers chopped off, at the Orumiyeh Central Prison. A third individual facing a similar situation is Arash Ali Akbari, 32, who was sentenced by the Second Branch of the Urmia Court to have his right hand amputated. The punishments, referred to in Arabic as hudud, are extreme punishments based on a radical interpretation of Sharia Law. They were rarely applied in the past and their use today is the source of controversy wherever they are carried out. Despite the controversy, no efforts by human rights groups, both local and international, have managed to prevent similar punishments from happening. Traditionally, punishments which are classified as hudud cannot be pardoned and are carried out in public. Sort of an awkward hashtag - more than sort of - and yet there's a cluster of accounts using it and retweeting it on English-language Twitter, with explanations about its domestic origins and international significance ?? https://t.co /IFyFqq1F7q[24] — Omri Ceren (@omriceren) October 16, 2020[25] Daniel Pomerantz: BDS resolutions on campuses represent dangerous 'intersectionality'[26]Over the past few weeks, in moves that were in equal measures galling, ill-timed and stunningly decontextualized, students at two prominent American universities — including my alma mater — voted in favor of divesting from Israel. These votes occurred during the 2020 High Holiday season, when Jewish students may have been less available to weigh in on this debate as they were navigating virtual synagogue services or other COVID-compliant religious gatherings. While these votes, at Columbia University in New York and at the University of Illinois, are symbolic in terms of university policy, they are nonetheless significant as they reflect a shift in student opinion that affects life on campus and could eventually have repercussions on enrollment and philanthropy. These moves stem from the increasing focus on intersectionality on the American college campus. Intersectionality suggests that the world can be seen through the lens of 'oppressor' and 'oppressed,' and that the only moral course of action is to fight all things deemed 'oppressive.' This can lead to unintended paradoxes. Just prior to the holiday of Yom Kippur, on Sept. 23rd, the U of I student government passed a resolution in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. But this resolution also called on the school to divest from transnational companies that contribute to a number of causes deemed objectionable, including doing business with Israel, the only country singled out in this manner. The vote was 22 to 11, with seven abstentions. Then, on the heels of the conclusion of the 25-hour fast day, Columbia's University Apartheid Divest group announced the results of its weeklong campuswide referendum. Nearly 1,800 students, more than a third of the campus, voted, according to Jewish Insider, and 61% of them supported the resolution recommending that the university's board divest from companies profiting from or otherwise supporting Israeli policies regarding the Palestinians. Columbia's president, Lee Bollinger, issued a strongly-worded statement of dissent. 'It is unfair and inaccurate to single out this specific dispute for this purpose when there are so many other, deeply entrenched conflicts around the world.' He emphasized that the university does not formulate official policy based on such referendums and said that the Boycott Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel had negatively affected the campus.

Nimesh Thaker, who worked at BBC World News until this this week, used an anonymous Twitter account to defend the rapper Wiley, who made a number of statements on Twitter this summer deemed antisemitic. After a Jewish radio host named Emma Barnett referenced Wiley's remarks in speaking about her family's Holocaust history, Thaker wrote that she was 'using the same old antisemitism excuse whenever people criticize Israel.' The Jewish Chronicle of London last month traced the account back to Thaler. Over the summer, Wiley tweeted: 'I don't care about Hitler, I care about black people' and 'There are 2 sets of people who nobody has really wanted to challenge #Jewish &#38; #KKK but being in business for 20 years you start to understand [sic] why.' He later apologized for the statements, but then made new ones deemed antisemitic. pic.twitter .com/BtyX8F0jjP[31] — Omri Ceren (@omriceren) October 16, 2020[32] Danish neo-Nazi jailed for a year for desecrating over 80 Jewish graves[33]A Danish court on Friday sentenced a 39-year-old man with neo-Nazi sympathies to a year in prison for desecrating a Jewish cemetery in the western town of Randers. The man and his 28-year-old accomplice were both found guilty of desecrating a graveyard and aggravated vandalism, but the latter's sentence has yet to be handed down. In November 2019, 81 years after Kristallnacht when Nazis smashed Jewish-owned stores, buildings and synagogues in Germany, the pair desecrated more than 80 tombstones, overturning some and covering others with graffiti. The two were also found guilty of vandalism on two other occasions, for covering a building adorned with two Stars of David with paint and putting stickers with the logo of the neo-Nazi Nordic Resistance Movement (NMR) group on a rainbow-colored park bench. These 'actions were sending a message that was intended to threaten, insult or degrade certain groups because of their beliefs, ethnic origins or sexual orientation,' police prosecutor Cathrine Brunsgaard Jacobsen said in a statement after the sentencing. The 39-year-old, whose name was not disclosed, is a leading member of the Danish branch of NMR, according to the prosecutor. NMR, which designates itself as a 'revolutionary national socialist' organization, was founded in Sweden in 1997 and is present in all of the Nordic countries. Controversy as NYPD Says That Attack on Brooklyn Hasidic Man Wasn't Hate Crime[34]New York City police on Friday were investigating an attack on a Hasidic Jewish man in Brooklyn — but as an attempted robbery, rather than the hate crime some members of the community believe it was. Surveillance video showed two suspects approaching the man from behind around 10:40 p.m . on Thursday on Barlett Street in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. We are sickened by the brutal and unprovoked attack on an Orthodox man in Brooklyn in broad daylight. We extend our best wishes to the victim and call for the swift apprehension of the perpetrators.pic.twitter.com/bZgbDsrRW0[35] — American Jewish Committee (@AJCGlobal) October 16, 2020[36] ;The suspects chased him, beat him and unsuccessfully tried to steal his bag, injuring the victim's face. The man managed to hold on to his belongings and the suspects fled the scene empty-handed. Two eyewitnesses who spoke to CBS News expressed the view that the attack was sparked by antisemitic hatred, with one of them adding that robbery might have been an additional motive, because 'from what I know, this place is not the best.' Separately, ABC News reported that the vocal community activist and former NY State Assemblyman Dov Hikind had called the attack a hate crime, noting as well that the police had said this was not the case.New Children's Book Highlights Heroism of Anne Frank[37]We can all aspire to be heroes. That is the lesson of an illustrated book series that recounts contributions that a wide range of individuals have made in the world. Sonia Sotomayor, Billie Jean King, Albert Einstein, Rosa Parks, Jackie Robinson, Helen Keller, George Washington and Benjamin Franklin are among the 22 short illustrated biographies so far in the series for children from kindergarten through about fourth grade. 'The series has grown because we're in an age where people are starved for heroes,' Brad Meltzer, the writer and creator of the series, told The Algemeiner. Few books in the series are more poignant than one about the young Jewish girl Anne Frank. She went into hiding with her family from 1942 to 1944 during the German occupation of the Netherlands in World War II. The family tried unsuccessfully to leave the Netherlands for the United States. As Jewish persecution increased, the family hid in rooms in a secret annex behind a bookcase in the building where Anne's father worked.https://www.algemeiner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AnneFrank_CV-1.jpgPlay Video[38] We have lots of ideas, but we need more resources to be even more effective.

ROBYN CURNOW, CNN ANCHOR: Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us here in the United States and all around the world, you're watching CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Robyn Curnow.
So just ahead, President Trump tries to backtrack after his refusal to explicitly condemn white supremacy during Tuesday night's chaotic and messy debate.
And it wasn't just Americans watching with dismay. The eyes of the world were too as many question just what happened to American leadership? We'll discuss that.
And also, tens of thousands of Americans are facing job losses today. Airlines prepare for huge layoffs as the federal aid that propped up the industry expires.
ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN Center, this is CNN NEWSROOM with Robyn Curnow.
CURNOW: Great to have you along with me this hour. So the U.S. President, Donald Trump, is once again in cleanup mode after his chaotic presidential debate on Tuesday where he once again failed to condemn white supremacists. While at a rally in Minnesota, Mr. Trump tried to declare himself the winner of the debate, even though some allies have voiced concern about his performance.
Now the President also continued to bash his political rival Joe Biden and falsely claimed the Democratic nominee is trying to cancel the remaining debates.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I was debating two people last night. Joe Biden is too weak to lead this country. You know Biden lost badly when his supporters are saying he should cancel the rest of the debates. Now I understand he's canceling the debates. Let's see what happens. I think that's not going to be a good move for him. (END VIDEO CLIP)
CURNOW: Well, at a rally in Ohio, Joe Biden hit back. He called out Mr. Trump for telling the far right group Proud Boys to, quote, stand back and standby. And called the President's debate performance a national embarrassment.
Well, Mr. Trump later tried to walk back those comments by telling the group to, quote, stand down instead, but he still failed to explicitly condemn white supremacists. As Kaitlan Collins now reports -- Kaitlan.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
TRUMP: I have always denounced any form, any form, any form of any of that. You have to denounce.
KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): After refusing to explicitly condemn white supremacy and right-wing extremists in last night's debate, President Trump declined to denounce them once again today.
TRUMP: I don't know who the Proud Boys are. They have to stand down, let law enforcement do their work.
COLLINS: Trump now saying he doesn't know the Proud Boys, a far right group that's endorsed violence, which he refused to denounce last night.
TRUMP: Proud Boys, stand back and stand by.
COLLINS: Trump quickly pivoting from his actions to Joe Biden.
TRUMP: Now, Antifa is a real problem, because the problem is on the left, and Biden refuses to talk about it.
COLLINS: The fallout from President Trump's frenzied debate performance was felt throughout Washington today.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It sounds like President Trump was President Trump.
COLLINS: Despite Trump saying today that he received rave reviews.
TRUMP: We have gotten tremendous reviews on it.
COLLINS: Privately, CNN spoke with several Trump officials, advisers and supporters who acknowledged that he was too aggressive, didn't tout enough accomplishments, and lacked a clear line of attack on his opponent.
TRUMP: There's nothing smart about you, Joe.
COLLINS: Even those who helped him prepare for the debate, like former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, conceded that he came on too strong.
CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), FORMER NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR: It was too hot. Listen, you come in and decide you want to be aggressive. And I think that was the right thing to be aggressive, but that was too hot.
COLLINS: Any chance for decorum during last night's debate was quickly dashed as the President interrupted Biden at nearly every chance he got.
JOSEPH BIDEN, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Would you shut up, man?
(CROSSTALK)
CHRIS WALLACE, MODERATOR: Mr. President, I'm the moderator of this debate and I would like you to let me ask my question and then you can answer...
TRUMP: Go ahead.
COLLINS: The chaotic nature of the debate driving the Commission on Presidential Debates to issue a statement saying --
Last night's debate made clear that additional structure should be added to the format of the remaining debates to ensure a more orderly discussion of the issues.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
CURNOW: Kaitlyn Collins reporting there.
So Tuesday's debate has certainly put the far right group called Proud Boys into the international spotlight. Sara Sidner explains who the group is and what they stand for exactly --Sara.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's go with a [bleep] Antifa chant. Let's start it. Ready?
AUDIENCE: [Bleep] Antifa. [Bleep] Antifa. [Bleep] Antifa.
[04:05:00]
SARA SIDNER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The Proud Boys are known for holding rallies being armed to the teeth, decked out in tactical gear, black and yellow shirts and being ready to rumble with anti- fascists.
They say as a whole, all this is solely for self-defense. But that is not how a New York jury saw it in 2019. Two Proud Boys were convicted for attempted gang assault and riot for this beating that unfolded in Manhattan between Proud Boys wearing the red hats and Antifa members in all black.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're fiery, but we're peaceful.
SIDNER: They say they believe in law and order, but apparently not in this case. ENRIQUE TARRIO, PROUD BOYS CHAIRMAN: We are definitely not going to apologize for fighting back when somebody throws a glass bottle of urine at you. I am sorry.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I pledge allegiance --
SIDNER: They say they are not a hate group and members have sued over being described that way. But the Anti-Defamation League says that's exactly what they are.
JONATHAN GREENBLATT, CEO, ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE: Proud Boys, unequivocally are a hate group. They style themselves as a quote, ""pro-Western fraternity."" But their rhetoric frequently invokes anti- Semitism, misogyny, xenophobia, particularly targeting immigrants, anti-Muslim bias, and both homophobia and transphobia.
SIDNER: So when the President was unwilling to explicitly condemn white supremacists and then said this --
TRUMP: Proud Boys, stand back and standby, but I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what, somebody's got to do something about Antifa and the left.
SIDNER: Those who track hate were beyond alarm. The Proud Boys celebrate it.
SIDNER (on camera): What does ""stand back and standby"" mean to you as a leader of the Proud Boys?
TARRIO: The organization does not see that as an endorsement in any way.
SIDNER: He plays it down. But their chat rooms hype it up. Memes popped up minutes after the President said it. His exact words used as a rallying cry with this added, ""F* it. Let's go back to Portland."" Another one reads, ""standing by, sir.""
TARRIO: I was the one that said that.
SIDNER (on camera): So the President mentions your name. Is this going to be used as a recruiting tool?
TARRIO: I mean, any media is used -- I wouldn't say that it was like a recruiting tool. Anytime that we're in the media, as a matter of fact, one of --
SIDNER (voice-over): He then boasts about the Proud Boys mentions on Twitter after the debate.
TARRIO: So apparently, Americans think that Proud Boys are more important than coronavirus at this moment.
SIDNER: The ADL says there are many serious consequences to the President's inability to plainly state that he condemns white supremacists.
TRUMP: I've always denounced any form -- any form -- any form of any of that.
SIDNER: The President was asked to do it again after the debate, but again, never uttered the words ""white supremacists.""
GREENBLATT: We need to stop asking for explanations and simply take him at his word. He believes these people are his allies, and he's given them a call to arms.
SIDNER: Taylor Dumpson knows the terror that can bring. She was targeted in a neo-Nazi trolling campaign for simply becoming American University's first black female student body president.
TAYLOR DUMPSON, LAW STUDENT, AMERICAN UNIVERSITY: To me, as a hate crime survivor and cyber harassment target. I know far too well how dangerous this rhetoric is and that it causes real harm and real damage and real violence in our communities.
SIDNER (on camera): Taylor Dumpson watch the debate intently and she said when she heard the President's answer to the question asking him to denounce white-supremacists, she said it left her feeling terrified all over again.
Now as for the Proud Boys, they have denounced white-supremacists. They say that they have members of many different ethnicities that a part of the Proud Boys. So I asked them what they thought about the President's answer to the question. And in their minds, they said he did denounce white-supremacists by answering in the affirmative when asked if he would denounce white-supremacists. The President said, sure. And that was good enough for the Proud Boys. For many, many other it simply was not.

CHURCH: Thanks, Sara, for that.
So earlier I spoke to Patrick Healy. He's a politics editor of ""The New York Times"" and asked him what the key takeaways were.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
PATRICK HEALY, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: I think there are three. One is about this President and issues of race. His inability to condemn white-supremacy and to talk coherently about racism in this country. You know, is really sort of staggering. He's just unwilling, unable to do it and you have to ask why that is, why he's so incapable of condemning white supremacists in this country.
You know, the second is that it's become just increasingly clear that President Trump's main strategy in these last five weeks is to destabilize voting as much as possible, to scare people about mail-in voting.
[04:10:00] He made this call to his supporters to go to polling sites, to watch the balloting which sort of everyone knows is basically calling for supporters to go and intimidate people at the polling places. So he's looking to basically disrupt an election that probably will be won on the margins to try to drive down votes, you know, as much as possible.
And the third take away is just that this President does not have a real strategy to beat Joe Biden at this point that is in any way substantial. He's behind in most -- President Trump's behind in most polls right now with five weeks to go. You know, he has an economic case that he could make to the country. He certainly has a Supreme Court justice now and a Republican Senate so he could offer, you know, a conservative agenda to try to sell to the country for a second term. But it's just become so clear that he's not interested in talking about the future of what he would do. He's just interested in really in chaos and tear down politics.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
CURNOW: Patrick Healy speaking to me a little bit earlier.
So U.S. TV ratings indicate 73 million Americans watched that debate, but it had jaws dropping around the world too from allies and adversaries alike. Later this hour we'll look at international reaction to this unprecedented 90 minutes.
Now the next debate will be between Vice Presidential nominee, Democratic Senator Kamala Harris and Vice President Mike Pence for the Republicans. CNN's coverage begins at 7 p.m. on the U.S. East Coast on Wednesday. That's Thursday at midnight in London, 3 a.m. in Abu Dhabi, and 7 a.m. on Thursday morning for all of you folks in Hong Kong.
And Donald Trump's former 2020 campaign manager has actually stepped down from his role as senior advisor. Brad Parscale was detained by police and hospitalized on Monday after allegedly making suicidal threats. He was demoted from campaign manager earlier this year after extremely low turnout at the President's rally in Oklahoma.
So you're watching CNN. Still to come, tens of thousands of U.S. airline staff are to be furloughed after last minutes attempts to get more federal money failed. We have that story next.
[04:15:00]
CURNOW: The U.S. government will keep working for now. The Senate approved a stop-gap spending bill best hours before the shutdown deadline. Negotiations appeared to fall apart at one point. The Democrats and Republicans reached a compromise that funds the government but only through mid-December.
Now there is no such agreement on a coronavirus stimulus package. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin are in talks to get a deal just weeks before election day. Democrats say they are holding off on a planned vote on their 2 trillion stimulus approval to allow for more time for bipartisan negotiations. Spite a more positive tone, sources tell CNN both sides are still very far apart.
Now this lack of a stimulus deal means disaster for U.S. airline staff. Tens of thousands will be furloughed today. And the federal aid package that protected their paychecks expired just a few hours ago.
Well, American Airlines says it will begin to furlough 19,000 workers. United Airlines will do the same with more than 13,000 employees. Thousands of layoffs are looming at other airlines as well.
Well, John Defterios is standing by with more on all of this from Abu Dhabi. Hi, John, good to see you. So months of negotiations on Capitol Hill. But so far, no end. And then we're looking at thousands of jobs at stake here. I mean, this is really, really cutting it to the wire.
JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN BUSINESS EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR: Yes, and it's been dragging on as you're suggesting, Robyn, for the better part of the summer months in the United States with the northern hemisphere. And this is election year politics and why it's so difficult. The $3 trillion package in the spring at the height of COVID-19 kind of sailed through because of the crisis.
We're looking at something probably between 1.5 and $2.2 trillion there's going to be a striking point there in the middle. But the airlines are seeking $25 billion over six months, so just a fraction of it. They've had to go ahead with the furloughs because they didn't set the September 30th to October 1 deadline that Congress put forward here. And they're saying they'll reverse course, but clearly you have to give us some clarity on when it's going to happen. Here's the CEO of American Airlines.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DOUG PARKER, CEO, AMERICAN AIRLINES: The last thing we want to do is furlough employees. That's why we've been fighting so hard for them to come to an agreement.
So, at any rate, hard for me to tell you until we hear -- until we know where they are, but certainly, if there's a, you know, a clear and concrete path, as you know, we're not quite done yet but we will be done soon.
Of course, if it's -- if it's, you know, it gets worse, we need, you know, much more time to work and unclear as to whether that will be -- whether we can get something done or not. That's going to be -- that's going to be -- that's obviously going to be much worse.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
DEFTERIOS: Doug Parker saying this would be, rather than the last of the bailouts for the sector. That they can fly on their own in the second half of 2021. Also, we heard from Steve Mnuchin many times as U.S. Treasury Secretary, we're almost there. We're almost there. But it's not the first time they've said it as you know. CURNOW: Yes. Indeed. So it's not just about the airline industry and the airline industry in the U.S., there's sort of a definitely a global impact, isn't there? A knock on effect. It's affecting folks all around the world.
DEFTERIOS: Yes, it's fascinating to watch figures in fact. If the airline sectors not helpful, nor is the travel related businesses all around it. There's the air transport group here out of Geneva who put together a report saying that 46 million jobs are at stake right now, pretty hefty number. 10 percent directly related to airlines and aerospace companies and airports. But another 26 million jobs of the 46, Robyn, are all related to hospitality, the restaurants, the hotels, road transport that goes around it. And what we're looking at here in 2020 and 2021 is a drop of $1.8 trillion of global GDP.
[04:20:00]
Partially in the United States but worldwide, particularly in the developing world that is very dependent on business and tourism traffic.
CURNOW: It is, indeed. John Defterios, thanks so much for that update there. Live from Abu Dhabi.
So sticking with this theme, another tough break for the U.S. cruise ship industry, which has lost billions of dollars due to the pandemic. The Centers F\for Disease Control and Prevention is extending a no- sail order for cruise ships through the end of October has the virus continues to spread. The order affects ships that carry at least 250 passengers in waters with the U.S. jurisdiction. The CDC failed to convince the White House to extend the no-sail order into the next year despite claims from U.S. President Donald Trump that a vaccine is weeks away. The CDC says it likely won't happen until next year.
And then also, the CEO of Moderna says a viable vaccine may be widely available by late march or early April. The company is working to ramp up manufacturing ahead of a potential approval.
Meantime, drug maker AstraZeneca vaccine trials are still on hold in the U.S. after a participant became seriously ill. When asked why the trial was still on hold, the FDA Commissioner said it was confidential.
Regulators in Britain, Brazil and South Africa have decided to resume their trials.
Now a vaccine can't come quick enough in the U.S. now with more than 7.2 million cases of the virus. Brian Todd takes a look at how the country is faring -- Brian.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): New York City takes a major step at a vulnerable time. The city starts to reopen restaurants for indoor dining to 25 percent of their normal capacity and with rigorous inspections, but mayor Bill de Blasio isn't ready to take that step himself just yet.
MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO (D) NEW YORK CITY: My outdoor dining experiences have been amazing. I'm going to keep doing that for the foreseeable future. And then of course shift to indoor when the outdoor isn't as prevalent because of the weather.
TODD: This comes as New York City and other parts of the state see upticks in coronavirus cases that while slight at the moment are concerning. The mayor says in at least six specific neighborhoods the positivity rate continues to rise. Certain businesses and neighborhood institutions may have to close. America's top voice on the pandemic warns about those smaller upticks in test positivity.
DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: Which is generally a predictor that you're going to start seeing surges. So we've got to now double down and make sure that we're very conscientious without shutting down.
TODD: But should New York City pause its reopening of schools and restaurants which it started this week?
ANNE RIMOIN, EPIDEMIOLOGIST, UCLA SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH: I think that it's very important that New York weigh the risks of opening up at this point. We all know that when the virus has an opportunity to spread, it takes that opportunity. And I would hate to see all of the hard work that New York has done to keep this virus at bay be undone.
TODD: The trend nationwide is a major concern among experts. More than half the states now seeing a rise in cases.
DR. SEEMA YASMIN, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: We're also heading into flu season. We're also seeing more schools reopening for in person teaching, university campuses reopening for students as well. So all of these factors are converging to increase cases in some places but also just to make it a much more vulnerable time.
TODD: The Midwest states are almost all seeing rising case numbers, the spike in Wisconsin particularly alarming. Record hospitalizations there. The coronavirus task force warning of a, quote, intense period of viral surge in Wisconsin and pleading for social distancing.
But President Trump is still planning on holding back-to-back rallies in that state this weekend despite being pressed in the debate over why he continues to hold large events.
TRUMP: Because people want to hear what I have to say.
TODD: College campuses continue to be major drivers of transmission. An outbreak on the Notre Dame football team that infected a dozen and half players, according to their coach, spread like wildfire.
The University of Central Florida have residents of three sorority houses under quarantine attempting to head off an outbreak there. And Georgia Tech has canceled spring break.
(on camera): This comes as the federal government is still trying to fend off outbreaks on cruise ships. The CDC is issuing new guidance for the cruise ship industry. Extending its order for ships not to sail through October according to a federal health official who spoke to CNN. That official says CDC director Dr. Robert Redfield tried to extend that order into next year but he couldn't convince the White House.

Police say they are still investigating the incident but say any suspect is still unknown.
Still to come here at CNN, U.S. allies and adversaries all have something to say about the first U.S. presidential debate. Their reaction and what those 90 minutes might mean for the world order. That's next.
And leading opposition leader in Russia, Alexey Navalny is blaming Vladimir Putin for his poisoning in August. We're live in Berlin with the new details on that.
CURNOW: It is 28 minutes past the hour. I am Robyn Curnow live from CNN world headquarters here in Atlanta. So a reminder now of our top story this hour.
The U.S. President Donald Trump is in cleanup mode after his chaotic presidential debate on Tuesday where he failed to condemn white- supremacists. At a rally in Minnesota, Mr. Trump tried to declare himself the winner of the debate even though some allies have voiced concern about his performance. The contest was so messy that the commission in charge of presidential debates now says it's considering making changes to the format. On CNN veteran journalist Bob Woodward weighed in on that situation.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BOB WOODWARD, AUTHOR, ""RAGE"": The debate commission is not in the constitution. We now have a constitutional problem. The executive branch is the President. He clearly cannot stabilize the electoral process. In fact, he's stoking let's make it unstable. The Supreme Court really has no power at this moment, but the Congress does and it seems to me it's reached a boiling point. I mean, we are teetering here and the Congress needs to step."

The airline, which is the dominant carrier at MSP, is working with Mayo Clinic and Quest Diagnostics Inc. on the testing regime. The tests are part of a bigger effort to keep its people, planes and facilities free of the virus.
In a memo to employees Thursday, Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian said the testing will begin at MSP next week, then roll out to Atlanta, where the company is based, Detroit and New York, cities where it also operates hubs.
Through May, the rate of COVID-19 infection among Delta's employees who deal with the public has been five times lower than the national average, he said.
Delta also has started an internal unit called the Global Cleanliness team, which will be responsible for new ""standards and policies to ensure a consistently safe and sanitized customer and employee experience,"" Bastian said in the memo.
Such measures are also designed to encourage the flying public to return. But at the same time, Delta is taking steps that show it expects air travel to be diminished for some time to come.
This week, it offered incentive packages - including cash, health benefits, travel passes and career services - to encourage employees to
leave the airline for good.
Delta, which employs about 9,000 people in the Twin Cities and a few hundred more elsewhere in the state, has not said precisely how many of its 90,000 employees it aims to trim with the incentives.
Bastian said executives hoped the incentives - which he described as a ""once-in-a-career"" offer in cash and retiree benefits - would appeal to enough people that Delta would not have to resort to involuntary furloughs.
""The last thing we expected this year was to be encouraging people to depart - 2020 was intended to be a year of growth,"" Bastian wrote. ""But it's clear that the impact of the pandemic will be lengthy, and that Delta will need to be a smaller airline over the next few years.""
Since the coronavirus outbreak began to constrain air travel, Delta has reduced its flight schedule by more than 80% and parked more than two-thirds of its 900 planes. It also announced the early retirement of its MD-88, MD-90 and Boeing 777 aircraft, or 94 planes in all.
Analysts estimate that Delta has reduced its daily cash burn rate to about $40 million from $50 million in early May. Even so, the airline also has announced that it will need to renegotiate its debt agreements to avoid a default next year.
Separately, Bastian told employees that Delta has joined other businesses in Minnesota by calling for state lawmakers to pass a police reform bill ""focused on preventing unacceptable police behavior and ensuring that perpetrators of racist actions are held accountable.""
Delta is also pressing lawmakers in its home state of Georgia to pass hate-crimes legislation. The state is one of five in the country without a law offering extra protection against hate crimes.
And Bastian's note said the company itself ""must remain safe and welcoming for all Delta people"" even beyond its airports and planes.
""We will not tolerate racist, bigoted or hateful acts or statements in our workspaces or directed at our people,"" Bastian said. ""This includes racial and other bigoted, hateful and offensive comments on social media by Delta people, which hurts our culture and our people.""

But, as we challenge these old views of who we take ourselves to be, we're going to be moving into these spaces -- country music, NASCAR, the South generally. And there we're going to have to confront our ugliness directly. It's not going to be easy, but we're going to have to do it. 
Heilemann, acting as fill-in host, then brought up conservative skeptics on the issue: JOHN HEILEMANN: One of the things that happened I found just as striking in some ways in the other direction was the reaction among some conservatives to the Bubba Wallace story. inevitably, you have people like Dinesh D'Souza and Mark Dice and others who came out immediately and said, you know, that they think that this is all made up, that the noose -- we didn't get to see the noose -- we didn't get to see a picture of the noose -- the picture we saw isn't -- basically questioning the legitimacy of the story -- claiming somehow this is a Jussie Smollett thing. After he expressed shock that conservatives would doubt the story in spite of reports that black men have been found hanging in different parts of the country, he added: HEILEMANN; Tell me a little bit about what you think about that and whether the same way that I found the support and the solidarity so moving, I find the reaction incredibly infuriating, and partly because it's kind of inevitable that's the world we now live in this polarized political environment. Glaude began complaining: GLAUDE: You know, John, it's infuriating, but it's very familiar. Jimmy Baldwin -- the late American writer and critic -- once said, ""One of the most difficult and frustrating experiences of being black in this country is that we're constantly having to convince white America that what is happening to us is real."" And one could just simply substitute conservative America, right? That we always have to convince a certain segment of the population that the hell that we're catching is actually real. He then added: GLAUDE: And the reason why we have to do that is because we have to confront this world of make-believe, this willful ignorance, this innocence that so much of the country inhabits. And the reason why we inhabit that bubble of innocence, John, is because we don't want to confront what these events might say about us, right? But, less than an hour later at 4:49 p.m., on MSNBC's MTP Daily, correspondent Pete Williams announced breaking news that the FBI found that no hate crime had happened, and that the noose was just a rope used to open the garage door that had been there since long before Wallace started using the space..Below is a transcript of the relevant portion of the Tuesday, June 23, 2020, Deadline: White House on MSNBC: MSNBCDeadline: White HouseJune 23, 20204:49 p.m. EasternEDDIE GLAUDE, MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR; So the fact that we have a noose in the garage of Bubba Wallace -- that's just one indication that there's going to be a pushback.

Tell me a little bit about what you think about that and whether the same way that I found the support and the solidarity so moving, I find the reaction incredibly infuriating, and partly because it's kind of inevitable that's the world we now live in this polarized political environment.GLAUDE: You know, John, it's infuriating, but it's very familiar.

So this is a part of that American ritual -- that American theater of race. Something ugly and barbaric and cruel happens, we deny it in order to protect our innocence, and then we move forward. This is what we've done since our founding, and here we are in this inflection point. We have to challenge it for what it is so that we can imagine ourselves other.HEILMANN: Eddie Glaude, there was no one I wanted to hear from more about this topic than you, and you delivered as always. Thank you, my friend. "
143,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1001/Files (250).DOCX","Fair Observer",2020-08-25,"954 words",NA,"Leonard Weinberg",NA,"Donald Trump and the 'Kung Flu'",FALSE,"Over the course of his 2016 campaign and his subsequent presidential term, Donald Trump has sought to exploit popular fears of foreigners and certain American ethnicities to his political advantage. His verbal attacks have been selective. Irish, Italian and Polish Americans, for example, have proved immune to his insults (at least in his public utterances). Trump's favorite targets for public abuse have been Hispanics, especially individuals seeking to enter the country clandestinely along the border with Mexico. He has also complained bitterly and profanely, in a semi-public setting, about immigrants from Haiti and sub-Saharan African countries.
This is hardly the end of things. Early on in his administration, Trump imposed a ban, which was overturned by courts, on all Muslims seeking to enter the United States based on popular fears of terrorism. Very much unlike his two predecessors, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, who were careful to distinguish between terrorists and the followers of Islam, Trump sought to equate Muslims in general with terrorism, thereby inflaming existing popular fears.
Classic Demagoguery
Then came COVID-19, a disease that has taken the lives of nearly 168,000 of Americans to date. After some initial hesitation, Trump labeled it ""kung flu."" To cheers and wild laughter at mass rallies and other public events, the president has sought to deflect widespread criticism of his handling of the pandemic by blaming the Chinese-not merely the government but the people in general -conflating the Chinese martial art of kung fu with influenza to the delight of his followers.
All this, of course, is classic demagoguery intended to mobilize Trump's base of whites with less than a college education and win him their renewed support at the polls in November. The fact that he actually appears to believe what he is saying adds to the appeal of his message.
Trump's demagogic appeals have consequences for those targeted by his abuse. Using data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Report and the Bureau of Justice Statistics' National Crime Victimization Survey, researchers have reported a substantial decline in hate crimes committed against Asian Americans over the periods 2003-07 and 2014-18. Asian Americans appeared to be well on their way to acceptance by their fellow citizens. The arrival of COVID-19 arrested this development and turned it around. So that, for example, in the three months ending on July 1, another source reported over 800 discrimination and harassment incidents, including 81 assaults, aimed at Asian Americans in California alone.
Make Sense of the World Unique insights from 2000+ contributors in 80+ countries I agree to receive emails and other content from Fair Observer. I understand that I may repeal my consent at any time. You can review our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use for further information.
The situation of American Muslims is somewhat different. For members of this religious minority, there was no reversal of the trend toward greater acceptance, simply a continuation of widespread animus. Illustratively, as reported in The Daily Beast, in the two months following the murder of 51 Muslim worshippers at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, on March 15, 2019, by Brenton Tarrant, a young Australian man who reported being a ""fan"" of Trump, mosques in San Diego, California, New Haven, Connecticut, and Queens, New York, became the targets of arson attacks.
These crimes were simply the most menacing of some hundreds of anti-Muslim hate crimes in the United States that followed upon the Christchurch killings. Abbas Barzegar, the director of a national watchdog organization that tracks anti-Muslim bias incidents, told The Daily Beast in 2019, ""We've already reported over 500 incidences of anti-Muslim bias or harassment just this year so far."" Barzegar went on to say that the uptick in anti-Muslim events began in 2015 and continued unabated thereafter.
Poisonous Atmosphere
For how much of this is Trump responsible? The answer is not easily quantifiable, but at a minimum, we can say Trump has done little to qualm the poisonous atmosphere in the country. At a maximum, we can claim he has sought to promote a politics of inter-group hatred to advance his career and improve his chances of reelection.
There is a striking contradiction in this situation. As Trump and his base insult or, in some cases, physically assault Chinese Americans and Muslims, holding the Chinese responsible for COVID-19, individual members of such now stigmatized groups have been busy trying to save Americans from the disease. A long list of Chinese American epidemiologists, emergency room physicians and virologists, led perhaps by Dr. David Ho (director of the Aaron Diamond Research Center at Columbia University) and Dr. Thomas Tsai (Brigham and Women's Hospital), have been playing vital roles in fighting the disease, often at the risk of their own lives.
About the same applies to America Muslims from both the Middle East and South Asia. The list here would have to include Dr. Ashish Jha (director of Harvard Global Health Institute), Mahrokh Irani (Harvard Global Health Institute), Dr. Najy Masai and Dr. Imran Siddiqui. Of course, the list could be extended.
Will these performances by Chinese American and American Muslim physicians and scientists have any impact on Trump's campaign rhetoric and the bigoted perceptions of his base? Probably not. To do so would require Trump voters to link the physicians' backgrounds to the groups to which they belong and modify their attitudes accordingly - not an easy feat. Further, the president and his campaign operatives have too much invested in his crowd-pleasing rhetoric to change at this late date."
144,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1001/Files (250).DOCX","The South Asian Times",2020-10-06,"1477 words",NA,NA,NA,"Biden is best friend of India",FALSE,"New York, Oct. 6 -- The US presidentialelection is decided by the voters of ""battleground"" or ""swing states"", whichtake the winner to the magic number of 270 in the Electoral College.
The eight states which will decide the 2020 Presidential election include four northern states (Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota), three southern states (Florida, Georgia, North Carolina) and Arizona. Collectively, these eight states have 127 electoral votes. Some of these diverse states depend on agriculture, others on manufacturing or tourism. They've been impacted by Covid-19 in different ways.
Within each of these swing states, I believe, the roadmap ahead for Vice President Joe Biden and Trump is clear. The president must max out his performance with rural voters while Biden needs a robust turnout in the big cities.
Vice President Biden's easiest path to the presidency runs through the states Hillary Clinton won in 2016, as well as Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. This gets him to 278 electoral votes. WereBiden to win every state carried by Hillary Clinton along with the seven battleground states in which he's currently leading, he would secure 347 electoral votes in a landslide victory.
The interesting point this election is that the Indian American votes may turn out to be the margin of victory in battleground states.
In 2016 Trump had a narrow win in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. This 2020 cycle the Indo Americans / South Asians are doing extensive outreach to voters in 14+ languages through thousands of phone banking calls each week and are determined to turn out the 1.3 million Indo American votes for VP Biden. Per a recent survey, 80% of Indo Americans in battleground states are going to vote for VP Biden.There are 125,000 Indian American voters in Michigan, 156,000 in Pennsylvania and 37,000 in Wisconsin. Indian American votes will also make a huge difference in states such as Florida (eligible voter base of 193,000), Georgia (150,000), North Carolina (111,000), Texas (475,000), and Arizona (66,000).
Several Indo American organizations are reaching out to the voters through regular phone banking, text banking. We have launched digital social media advertisements through graphics in 14 languages, Bollywood based Get out the Vote videos. The community is engaged and we will see a bigger turnout for Biden-Harris and elect them as our next President and Vice President. Biden will lead us out of 4 long years of darkness into the path of Growth, Love, Equality, and Light!!
The fact remains that except for making some shrill but general statements, Trump has not really done anything substantive to grow arelationship with India, neither on the trade front nor on immigration. He has made it tougher to get green cards or H1 visas. Trump hasrevoked India's Special Trade Partner Status and levied tariffs on Indian imports. He has cut visitor Visa/Student visa and H1 visa to Indian immigrants. In the first debate, Trump clubbed India with China and Russia, saying India's Covid numbers cannot be trusted, thereby directly questioning Modi government's integrity on a world stage and hurting India's Reputation. India has managed COVID much better than Trump's mess of a management.
Trump has continued to blame India's greed for the TS withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement and falsely Claimed that PM Modi asked him to intervene in Kashmir. He even lied andfalsely claimed that PM Modi asked Trump to mediate the dispute with China. Trump has no trade deals signed with India so far - both times the two leaders met extensively, nothing came of it. The relationship they have is merely confined to photo-ops.
Joe Biden is the best friend India can have to further Indo-US relationship. As Vice President, he laid the foundation of furthering strong ties with India. He has clear policies and direction, which will help effectively resolve issues faced by Indian American community and grow Indo-US bilateral relationships at all levels: People to People, Business/Industry to Business/Industry.
Above all, the Biden White Housewill support a permanent seat for India at the United Nations Security Council.
On trade, five years ago, Biden set the goal of $500 billion in two-way trade. And he and President Obama talked about this as being the defining partnership of the 21st century.
Biden Administration will have no tolerance for terrorism in South Asia.
The Biden administration will handle China's relationships effectively. Joe Biden would sanction China for its plan to impose new national security rules on Hong Kong. His campaign on Wednesday accused President Trump of having ""enabled"" Beijing's curbs on freedoms in the former British colony. A Biden administration would ""fully enforce"" the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, ""including sanctions on officials, financial institutions, companies and individuals,""
In India and China's Quest for Strategic Dominance in the Indo Pacific Region, the Biden administration will be strategic to bring US-India closer.
Hate crimes against the South Asian communities have skyrocketed during the Trump administration. You won't hear our President saying anything against racial hatred. From grocery stores to workplaces to simply being in their community, manyAAPIs, including Sikh, Hindu, and Muslim Americans, have continually faced discrimination and hate, which is further exacerbated by Trump's dangerous rhetoric and fanning the flames of hate. The Obama-Biden Administration added ""Anti-Sikh"" and ""Anti-Hindu"" to the Department of Justice's hate crime reporting categories. The administration also provided resources and worked with local leaders to combat bullying directed at theAAPIcommunity. Joe will make clear that hate has no safe harbor in this country. And, his Justice Department will prioritize prosecuting hate crimes.
On visas, Biden will support family-based immigration and preserve family unification as a core principle of our immigration system, which includes reducing the family visa backlog. Biden committed that during his first 100 days, the focus will be on streamlining the naturalization process, to make it easier for qualified green card holders to move through the backlog. This will be a huge win for thousands of H1B workers who live in a limbo.
Biden will increase the number of visas offered for permanent, work-based immigration based on macroeconomic conditions and exempt from any cap the recent graduates of Ph.D. programs in STEM fields. And, he will support first reforming the temporary visa system for high-skill, specialty workers to protect wages, then expanding the number of visas offered and eliminating the limits on employment-based visas by country.
Biden will remove the uncertainty for Dreamers by reinstating the DACA program and explore all legal options to protect their families from inhumane separation. As president, Joe will end workplace raids and Protect other sensitive locations from immigration enforcement actions. No one should be afraid to seek medical attention, or go to school, their job, or their place of worship for fear of an immigration enforcement action.
Clearly, most Indian Americans would say without hesitation that Biden would be a better President and world leader and better for India on all counts. Biden's win, as seems likely, New Delhi would find anatural partner who will walk the talk.
In the first debate we saw two vastly different types of leadership. While Joe Biden outlined a vision for a unified, big-hearted America, Trump doubled down on the same blind partisanship and divisive rhetoric he's been pushing since he was on the campaign trail four years ago.
So much of who we are as Americans is at stake in this election. And while our choice could not be clearer, the road to get there will be tough.
The closer we get to November 3, the more Donald Trump and his allies are showing they will push our democratic institutions to their limits in their relentless pursuit of retaining power. Right now is the time to focus on doing everything we can to elect Joe, Kamala, and Democratic candidates running in key races around the country who will pull us back from the brink.
Biden isnot running just as anti-Trump candidate, he has shared his vision to rebuild the middle class and economy, restore American leadership in the world, deal with systematic racism, economic inequity, support for small businesses, immigration reform and plan for rural America. He wants to Restore the Soul of our Nation. It is time to work hard to elect Biden as the next President of the United States and Kamala Harris as the next Vice President.

In a speech on the Senate floor, U.S. Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) slammed President Donald Trump's refusal to condemn white supremacists during the course of last night's Presidential debate. Durbin also called on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) to bring Durbin's bill, the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act of 2020, to the floor for a vote. Last week, on a unanimous vote, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the House companion to Durbin's Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act of 2020. The bill would enhance the federal government's efforts to prevent domestic terrorism by requiring federal law enforcement agencies to regularly assess this threat, focus their resources on the most significant domestic terrorism threats, and provide training and resources to assist state, local, and tribal law enforcement in addressing these threats.
""Like most Americans, I was stunned by the President's refusal last night to condemn white supremacists during the course of last night's Presidential debate,"" Durbin said. ""Trump's comments were quickly embraced by the Proud Boys, an alt-right self-described 'western chauvinist' group who clearly viewed it as a call to action. The group immediately turned the President's words in the debate into a logo that's been widely circulated on social media.""
Durbin continued, ""For years now, in letters, briefings, and hearings, I have repeatedly urged the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of Homeland Security to take a strong stand against the ongoing threat of violent white supremacy and other far-right-wing extremists. Unfortunately, instead of following up with a comprehensive, coordinated effort, to no surprise, the Trump Administration has repeatedly chosen to downplay this deadly threat. A law-and-order President who looks the other waywinks, nods, and says 'stand by' to the militia groups and white supremacists.""
Durbin concluded, ""Last week, the House of Representatives passed the House companion to my billunanimous voice vote. Democrats and Republicans all agreed. Senator McConnell has a chance to take it up. Are we going to stand together as the House did on a bipartisan basis, condemning white supremacists who resort to violence and terrorism? Or are we going to say to them 'stand back and stand by?' It's time for us to step up together on a bipartisan basis.""
Since May 2019, Durbin has led two letters to Attorney General Bill Barr and FBI Director Chris Wray, asking what the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the FBI are doing to combat the growing threat of white supremacist violence targeting religious minorities and communities of color. In January, Durbin again pressed DOJ and FBI to take the initiative in leading a coordinated nationwide effort by federal, state, and local law enforcement and intelligence agencies to disrupt and prevent these violent domestic terrorism and hate crime incidents before they take place.
On September 17, FBI Director Christopher Wray testified to Congress that ""the top threat we face from domestic violent extremists stems from those we identify as racially/ethnically motivated violent extremists (RMVE)"" and that most of these are white supremacists.
According to the Anti-Defamation League, in 2019, domestic extremists killed at least 42 people in the United States in 17 separate incidents. This number makes 2019 the sixth deadliest year on record for domestic extremist-related killings. Last year, a Trump Administration Department of Justice official wrote in a New York Times op-ed that ""white supremacy and far-right extremism are among the greatest domestic-security threats facing the United States. Regrettably, over the past 25 years, law enforcement, at both the Federal and State levels, has been slow to respond.""

BOOK CLUB: Former STL broadcaster Don Marsh has joined the ranks of fiction writers.
Earlier this month, the longtime news anchor released his first novel, ""A Wink and a Nod.""
The mystery/crime tale revolves around an 80-year-old former reporter who reluctantly agrees to help a former colleague find her missing husband - a quest that puts him ""in the middle of an international illegal fentanyl operation.""
Marsh has written three previous books, including the 2017 memoir ""Coming of Age, Liver Spots & All.""
Marsh began his STL broadcasting career in 1971 at KTVI (Channel 2), where he was a main news anchor until 1994. He worked at KDNL (Channel 30) until 1998. From 2005 to 2019, he was a show host at KWMU (90.7 FM).
He is a member of the St. Louis Media Hall of Fame and in 2015 was named ""Media Person of the Year"" by the Press Club of Metropolitan St. Louis.
VICE SQUAD: STL native son and Pulitzer Prize-winner Ben C. Solomon will be chasing his next story for a different outlet.
The Olivette-reared video journalist announced Monday on Twitter that he will be joining VICE News as an international correspondent and producer.
After graduating from Ladue Horton Watkins High School in 2006 and DePauw University in 2010, Solomon went to work for The New York Times, where he was part of a team that won a Pulitzer for international reporting.
In 2019, Solomon was hired by PBS' Frontline as its first filmmaker-in-residence.
Solomon's mother, former television producer Eileen Solomon, retired in 2018 after 28 years as a journalism professor at Webster and Lindenwood universities. His father, Rick Solomon, is a former television photojournalist.
WAVELENGTHS: Longtime radio manager Leo Baldwin has been named the new manager of KYKY (98.1 FM) and KEZK (102.5 FM).
Baldwin has more than 20 years of experience in operations and programming management.
The top local hosts on the two stations include Paul Cook and the team of Jen Myers and Tim Convy at KYKY, and Greg Hewitt and Trish Gazall at KEZK.
Prior to his new STL gig, Baldwin programmed two stations in West Palm Beach, Florida, and was operations manager for a seven-station cluster. Before that, he managed stations in Indianapolis, Honolulu and Philadelphia.
Baldwin's new job begins immediately, said Becky Domyan, general manager of Entercom St. Louis, which now operates six stations in STL.
It has two talk-radio stations, KMOX (1120 AM) and KFTK (97.1 FM), and two urban/hip-hop stations, WNOU (96.3 FM) and WHHL (104.1 FM).
MORE TO GIVE: While Missouri may not be the most giving state in the U.S., at least it made the top half.
The Show-Me sector of the union has come in at No. 24 on the list of ""Most Charitable States"" from personal-finance website WalletHub.
The rankings were determined by looking at two main areas of charitable giving: volunteer hours worked and money donated.
Our centered state did best in the area of giving money, where we were ranked at No. 15. As to putting in the volunteer hours, we were only No. 32.
Border states that finished better than us were Arkansas (16), Illinois (20) and Nebraska (22). The less-giving neighbors were Oklahoma (31), Kentucky (32), Kansas (34), Tennessee (38) and Iowa (41).
The most charitable state in the nation was Utah; the least charitable, Arizona.

The migrations that made up the ethnic mosaic that made up the Union, always found the resistance of xenophobic groups in the United States. Meanwhile, white supremacy has existed since the time of the Ku Klux Klan, after the civil war, in all its resurrections.
Organic racism, intolerance, belief in the predestination of the ""white race,"" religious fundamentalism, the ideological laggards of fierce slavery that characterized an era of national history, and the intrinsic violence of the American system, have been the breeding ground for the emergence and progress of far-right domestic terrorist groups.
The war against the other
Terrorist attacks by white supremacists and other American extremists have been on the rise in recent years, according to an FBI report.
Between 1978 and 1995, three people were killed and 23 others injured after a series of mail bombings, carried out by terrorist Ted Kaczynski, known by the Unabomber.
On July 27, 1996, a bomb exploded at Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta during a concert in the middle of the Summer Olympics.
Several attacks were carried out against the World Trade Center in New York before September 11, 2001.
On June 17, 2015, at the Emanuel African Episcopal Methist Church in Charleston, South Carolina, a man entered the temple and began shooting at the faithful, killing nine people.
Two terrorists, one of them a Gulf War veteran, blew up a truck in Oklahoma City in April 1995, where 168 people, including 19 children, were killed and nearly 700 injured.
Twenty-two more died in El Paso, Texas, on August 3, 2019, in a mass shooting at a Walmart store. Police said they found an anti-muslim document defending white nationalist and racist views.
The series of attacks in 2019 underscores the threat posed by domestic violent extremists and perpetrators of hate crimes in
U.S., incentivized by President Donald Trump's racial and anti-immigrant hate speech.
Amid the country's deep general crisis, the purchase of war equipment is increased, while supremacist groups hold demonstrations carrying weapons in various states of the Union.
The exaltation of hatred and race war
Neo-Nazi organizations like The Base have sworn to start a race war in the United States. Founded at the end of 2018, it recruits, through the internet, people related to its ideology and distributes, in the networks, manuals for terrorist attacks and for the manufacture of domestic bombs.
One of the most active and fastest growing groups in recent months is Boogaloo Boys. Its members wear Hawaiian shirts and carry long weapons in public. Sometimes they cover their faces with gas masks.
The Boogaloo movement, according to analysts studying the far right, is a broad umbrella that encompasses white supremacists, neo-Nazis and arms-holding activists.
Another active group is the Civil War 2, which defends the right to possession of firearms, its members recently demonstrated in Trump support and against social isolation measures in some states to confront COVID-19.
A report by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) identified more than a hundred white nationalist groups and 99neo-Nazi groups active in the country.
On the other hand, the so-called ""patriotic movement"" consists of hundreds of paramilitary groups, whose mission, they say, is to wage war against the government and ""protect civil liberties"".
According to the SPLC, which is responsible for monitoring hate groups and extremists in the United States, there are currently 623 groups from the ""patriotic movement"".
Oath Keepers, Three percenters (the three percenters, which have 10,000 members) and Posse Comitatus (County Force), dress in combat uniforms and carry weapons for military use; exercises and raids with real ammunition.
""Their ideology is based on global conspiracy theories about threats to peace and stability, and they believe the federal government is collaborating with these conspiracies,"" says BBC Mundo.
The Extremism Project (CEP) has identified eight particularly dangerous white supremacy groups, such as the National Socialist Movement (NSM), the Hammerskin Nation and the Atomwaffen Division, which do not hide their belief that the white race is superior to the others, nor their homophobic and anti-Semitic feelings.
The Atomwaffen Division projects the image of a heavily armed militia preparing for an imminent race war. The Southern League and Evropa Identity claim that white identity is threatened by minorities or immigrants seeking to replace their Azrial, Anglo-Saxon culture.
Identity Evropa, Atomwaffen Division and Vanguard America promote active propaganda on university campuses and the National Socialist Movement and the Southern League have founded youth wings with student memberships.
Most of these groups express affinity with Donald Trump and his administration. Armed hatred is organized in the United States, under the complicit gaze of the White House.
Those who accuse others of promoting or not acting properly in the fight against terrorism should look inside their home, where hate ivy grows unhindered."

'The American dream story. It's not about Vincent,' a museum head says
On the night of June 19, 1982, a Chinese-American man was celebrating his stag night with friends in the US automotive capital, Detroit, when a fight broke out. 
Enjoying a marriage custom of his adopted culture, 27-year-old draughtsman Vincent Chin was days away from beginning a new life with his fiancée. But he never made it home that night. And days later, the 400 guests invited to his wedding would instead attend his funeral. 
Thirty-eight years ago today, June 23, Chin died in a hospital following four nights in a coma after he was brutally beaten with a baseball bat outside a McDonald's in Detroit's Highland Park neighbourhood. 
""It's because of you mother-f*****s we're out of work,"" one of his attackers, white Chrysler plant supervisor Ronald Ebens was said to have shouted, while taunting Chin in the car park of the Fancy Pants strip club. Ebens and his recently laid-off stepson Michael Nitz thought Chin was Japanese. 
""Back then an American car was a status symbol the world over,"" says Frank Wu, president of Queens College at the City University of New York. If you worked for a carmaker, ""it was a job you had for life, with health care and a pension"". Wu, 53, grew up 20km (12 miles) from Highland Park. 
By 1974, oil prices had quadrupled in the months following a decision by Opec, a cartel of major oil producing countries, the previous year to impose an oil embargo on the United States. It was an act of retaliation for the US administration's decision to resupply the Israeli military during the Arab-Israeli War. The outcome, often referred to as the ""economic Pearl Harbour"", effectively left the US car industry in crisis. 
Sales of fuel-efficient Japanese cars grew, while their gas-guzzling American counterparts steadily lost out. US carmakers began laying off workers, and violent displays of resentment became common. These included raffles where the prize was a chance to destroy a Japanese car, says Wu. 
""Anybody who actually drove a Japanese car could get shot at on the freeway, that was if they were black or white,"" says author and activist Helen Zia, executor of Chin's estate. 
""The rise of the East and the decline of the West was a classic theme,"" Wu says. 
Although their first assault on Chin ended outside the Detroit club, his attackers later tracked him down at the McDonald's outlet after paying a stranger US$20 to help search for him. In front of a crowd of bystanders, Nitz held Chin down while Ebens violently swung away with the bat until Chin's skull cracked and his brain lay bare on the tarmac. Witnesses recorded Chin's final words: ""It's not fair."" 
Two years before Chin's murder, Zia, now 68, was laid off from her job in the car industry and began a career as a freelance journalist for the Detroit City Magazine and later the Detroit Metro Times. 
After reading about Chin in the days following his death, she clipped the story and began to follow the case. 
""For me, it was this big question: why would this Chinese-American get killed in a time when there was so much racial hatred towards Japanese?"" she says. 
In March 1983, Chin's case was back in the spotlight when the two men who had assaulted him pleaded guilty to manslaughter charges. Neither went to prison; both were fined US$3,000 and ordered to pay US$780 court costs. 
Chin had worked part-time as a waiter in the Golden Star Chinese restaurant in Ferndale, Detroit. After the verdict was handed down his mother, Lily Chin, met at her son's former workplace with lawyers, representatives from the city's Chinese community and a single Japanese-American, to talk about the tragedy. 
When it happened it was important ... Today the meaning is different because there's a Vincent Chin in the African-American community on a daily basis. 
Renee Tajima-Pena, 61, a professor of Asian-American studies who made a film about Chin's killing 
""Lily was heartbroken,"" says Zia. 
Chin's death became a trigger for Asian-American unity. ""The Vincent Chin case was where waiters and cooks and laundrymen and blue-collar workers and scientists and engineers and African-Americans united to fight for justice,"" she says. 
""This was really the first time in a broad-based way that Asian-Americans came together and called ourselves Asian-Americans to fight for civil rights. Before then there wasn't really anything beyond civil activists and students."" 
Though Chin's fiancée, Vicky Wong, withdrew from the public gaze and never spoke out, Lily Chin would attend Asian-American meetings, quietly sobbing but always listening, Zia says. 
""Wong's response was probably more typical, especially for someone of an Asian background, but Vincent Chin's mother's response is so unique in a way,"" she explains. 
""Lily Chin, she stopped sobbing and she said, 'We have to show this is not American justice. We have to show that no other mother should go through this'."" 
Chin's killing was ""the turning point"", fuelling a long-awaited rights movement that had been years in the making, says Renee Tajima-Pena, 61, a professor of Asian-American studies at the University of California, Los Angeles. 
Also a filmmaker, in 1983 Tajima-Pena began making a documentary about the case, titled Who Killed Vincent Chin? At the same time, Zia and lawyers representing the Chin estate founded the Detroit-based civil rights group American Citizens for Justice. Lawyers told the group that civil rights laws were not designed to protect Asian Americans. 
After the group organised a number of demonstrations and repeatedly wrote to federal courts, the federal government stepped in to prosecute the case, Zia says. In 1987, the Chin estate won a civil suit filed against Chin's killers. Ebens was ordered to pay US$1.5 million and Nitz ordered to pay US$50,000 to Lily Chin to compensate for the financial loss of her son's earnings as a draughtsman. 
""What came out of that really is to the benefit of all Americans,"" Zia says. ""The decision from the Vincent Chin case was that an Asian-American would be protected, a migrant would be protected, and they took a broader point of view in applying these federal civil rights laws to all Americans."" 
In 1988, Who Killed Vincent Chin? opened New York's New Directors/New Films Festival, and was later nominated for an Academy Award for best documentary feature. 
Tajima-Pena says Chin's killing ""really strengthened the pan-Asian movement"" in the US. 
""I think it really reminded people of things that happened to them over the years, which is very similar to the pandemic hate today,"" she says. ""People saw themselves in the violence that was happening and became more politicised."" 
Chin's story is not well-known in the wider US community, says Nancy Yao Maasbach, 48, president of New York's Museum of Chinese in America. 
""Stories around Vincent Chin are either too painful or too unjust; it's a hard story to present to migrants, especially those chasing the American dream,"" she says. ""People see Asian-Americans as stories of success. The American dream story. It's not about Vincent."" 
""A lot of museums don't carry these stories, so we're creating a study guide about it,"" Yao Maasbach adds. 
Tajima-Pena says the significance of what happened after the killing of Chin has changed over the years. 
""When it happened it was important, because at the time Asian-Americans recognised that we were also victimised by racism and hate crimes, and that we had to come together. Today the meaning is different because there's a Vincent Chin in the African-American community on a daily basis."" 
While Nitz, who held Chin down, paid off his civil suit debt, Ebens' has grown to more than US$8 million after accruing interest. Although not much can be done from a legal standpoint, Zia says the case is renewed each year by American Citizens for Justice, the human rights group founded following Chin's killing. 
""The lesson is, we have to join together,"" Zia says. ""In the case of Vincent Chin we did that, and even though it did not bring Vincent back to life, it did bring benefits of justice. 
""The great vow we have made is that his killers will never see a day where they aren't reminded they owe a debt to humanity.""

In March, when the first spike of Covid-19 cases in New York was filling hospitals and panicking the city, my immunocompromised mother-in-law and my eight-months pregnant wife both contracted the disease. At first, it was just like a bad cold, but soon my wife was crying in pain every time she coughed and my mother-in-law could barely get out of bed. As my mother-in-law's oxygen levels ticked down day by day, I would listen to her breathing and wonder whether I should bring her to a hospital. 
 The idea terrified me. Two friends had parents on ventilators, both of whom would soon die. I didn't want my mother-in-law away from the family that loved her, to disappear into the black hole of a hospital system where we wouldn't be able to visit. Every night an old friend, Chris, a trauma surgeon in Philadelphia, would call me to discuss how the disease was progressing and whether it was still safe to have my mother-in-law at home. ''In normal times, I'd say she should go to the hospital,'' he told me at one point, ''and if her oxygen dips any more, she has to.''
 At the same time, I had to care for my two children, ages 2 and 4. They seemed OK, not talking much about the virus, excitedly cheering emergency medical workers each night and happily playing throughout the day. But every night they made me tell them the same bedtime story, in Spanish (reinforcing the language felt more important with my Colombian-American wife and mother-in-law terribly ill), about a frog and a butterfly on a quest to find the ingredients for a magic spell to cure ''Mama Bruja'' and ''Abuela Nani Lobo.'' They'd go deep into the forest in search of a rainbow-colored fly and the pollen from a rainbow-colored flower, which they would capture with their long, specially designed tongues. And then they'd bring the ingredients back, say the magic words, and dispel the sickness.
 Each day, that was the ritual. I'd tell the story, put my children to bed, and then talk to Chris. On one level, bedtime with my children was an escape into the fantasy of storytelling, while Chris was giving me the certainty of scientific expertise most useful for the present moment. But back then there was little scientific certainty around, and so much of what Chris had to offer was something simpler and more human -- an old friend carving out time to be with me each day, communicating concern and love and hope for my sick family members. In that way, it wasn't so different from what was happening as my children and I recited magic words each night.
 Stories are a quintessentially human method of responding to the chaos and uncertainty of the world. Science is a quintessentially human method of trying to control that chaos, and data is its raw material. Adrift in the world, uncertain of the future, hostage to fate, but possessed of increasingly powerful tools for carving up pieces of the world and putting them under the microscope, is it any wonder that we increasingly turn to science when looking for deliverance from our human predicaments?
 Science, after all, will eventually bring us to the end of the pandemic, just as it has helped limit the damage through better treatments and proof of the benefits of wearing masks. ''Science over fiction,'' was one slogan of the Joe Biden campaign, a welcome message to those who'd like public policy tethered more to reality than political fantasy.
 But because science supposedly gives clear answers about everything from how to open schools in a pandemic to who will be elected president, we tend to rush to embrace it as a panacea. Some, like the popular podcaster and author Sam Harris, even think science can answer moral questions. Rarely does it occur to us how often the invocation of ''science'' is used to mask value judgments, or political deliberation.
 When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatricians released separate guidelines for reopening schools, the difference lay not in the underlying science but in their institutional priorities, one focused on disease spread and the other on the welfare of children. Likewise, the difference in how New York City handled the reopenings of day cares and schools reflected not simply science, but also what could be more easily demanded of workers who lacked the protection of a powerful union.
 As much as we'd like to believe in ''science over fiction,'' decisions in the real world require negotiating between what we think the data means, what human value we'd like to assign to it and what stories about it we can get others to accept. Data alone is not knowledge, and it is certainly not wisdom. It rarely says as much as we think it does.
 Yet its allure is undeniable, persistent. As I watched the election returns on Tuesday and Wednesday, I did so with the sinking feeling that I'd been fooled again by the lure of data. Even though it looked like Biden could still win, it was clear that those hard numbers I'd been absorbing for weeks, based on fine -tuned methodologies, correcting for past mistakes, aggregated to minimize chances of error, hadn't come close to reflecting reality. ''You are literally working on an essay about the problems with relying too much on data,'' my wife told me the morning after the election, ''and yet you were so confident in the polls.''
 Mona Chalabi, a data journalist at The Guardian, is well aware of its shortcomings. ''The biggest problem with data is pure arrogance,'' she told me recently. Data can easily be misleading, inaccurate or irrelevant to the question at hand. She recounted how a decade ago, she was at a conference discussing reports she'd helped produce for the International Organization for Migration on the needs of internally displaced people and refugees in Iraq when a fellow attendee told her, ''You do know all these numbers are wrong?'' Or rather, not wrong, but incomplete. The reports relied on surveys that asked about blankets, food and shelter, but never about things like electricity generators, which were critical and sorely lacking. ''It felt like an earthquake to have someone say, 'Everything you think you know about this group of people is wrong.'''
 These days she creates beautiful, sometimes whimsically hand-drawn charts and figures illustrating everything from the pricing of potential coronavirus treatments (with differing prices expressed by the height of pills floating above the pained, open mouths of women representing different countries at the bottom of the graph) to the percentage of interracial marriages in the United States (in which the flowing fabric of a woman's wedding veil represents different types of interracial marriages over time).
 ''I illustrate data because I'm deeply skeptical of the data,'' she says. ''I want to remind people how many human biases go into it.'' After all, it's hard to look at a graph drawn by hand, in a deliberately artistic and emotional manner, and not see the human intentions lying behind it. This focus on the unreliability of our metrics keeps Ms. Chalabi shuttling between the data we have and the voices of those whose experiences don't line up with the data.
 ''Anecdotes guide the questions I use to approach data,'' she told me before bringing up oft-cited statistics on hate crimes against Muslims after 9/11. ''Anecdotally, people are telling me that they experienced hate crimes, but they're not reporting them,'' she said. ''So that leads me to ask if there are differences between reporting rates in different communities.'' Does the data reveal real levels of discrimination, or distrust of a police force that has engaged in anti-Muslim discrimination itself?
 ''Data replicates systems of power,'' she said, since the types of questions that get asked, and the sort of information deemed worthy of collection, often reflect the biases of the powerful. But people, unruly, free creatures that they are, tend to undermine those systems, for good and ill.
 Last December, I traveled to Iraq with the United Nations refugee agency. It was my first time back in the country in over a decade, when I'd deployed as a young, idealistic lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps. Back then, data told a promising story. I was sitting in Anbar Province in September 2007 when Gen. David Petraeus testified to Congress about the progress there -- the 45 percent decline in civilian deaths, 55 percent decline in sectarian killings, 445,000 Iraq security force members on the payroll, and so on.
 Then I returned home and, over the intervening years, watched all the progress evaporate. Hundreds of thousands killed from war and genocide. Five and a half million displaced. Thousands enslaved and raped. Last December in Sinjar, where the Islamic State waged genocide against the Yazidi population, I saw an exquisite and sad mural of the silhouette of a man under an ISIS flag with the head and wings of a bird, his arms outstretched to the open sky, a chain around his ankle holding him down.
 The next day, in the bombed-out center of Mosul, near a mural of a boy lifting up a curtain of rubble to reveal a rainbow of colors, I met a man whose shattered house the United Nations Development Project was restoring. He'd sheltered there with his children in the final days of the battle against ISIS. ''We were trapped,'' he told me. ''We ate cats, rats. For water you had to risk your life to go to the river where the soldiers would shoot at you. We collected rainwater to drink. There were days my children were so hungry, and there was shelling and shooting, and I just wanted to rescue them.'' No data could capture what this experience meant, or what I, an American citizen, owed in response.
 The projects carried out by the U.N. agencies there tended to focus on meeting immediate, local needs, informed by decades of failed reconstruction efforts, sophisticated, data-rich reports on what types of assistance were most necessary and feedback from their local Iraqi partners. But the largest reconstruction project we saw there, and also the one the local Moslawis with us seemed most proud of, had little to do with such hardheaded pragmatism.
 This was the reconstruction, backed by UNESCO and the United Arab Emirates, of the al-Nuri Grand Mosque, the 12th-century mosque and symbol of the city destroyed by ISIS in 2017. As we walked through rubble that was being carefully sorted by construction workers into the original seven bands of stone that made up the old minaret, I made out profane anti-ISIS graffiti on some of the still standing pillars. Amused, I asked a Moslawi man who'd written it. ''C.T.S.,'' he said sadly, referring to Iraqi special forces. ''It would not have been a Moslawi, because we would respect what has been left behind.''
 When so many were homeless, living in camps, and when the resources of the humanitarian community were stretched beyond limits by a lack of interest in Iraq and in the suffering of Iraqis, to see a $50 million project focusing on a cultural site might seem strange or unpractical -- though only if you think culture and art and man's search for transcendence aren't as essential to humanity as more quantifiable needs.
 ''Human life has always been lived on the edge of a precipice,'' wrote C.S. Lewis on the eve of World War II. ''If men had postponed the search for knowledge and beauty until they were secure, the search would never have begun.'' And whether we like it or not, that search yields beauty far more regularly than it has ever yielded any kind of scientific mastery over our fates.
 We want the comfort of certainty. Millenniums of human art tell us that certainty is not for us, that God only answers Job from the whirlwind, and only answers him with more questions. But millenniums of human art tell us other things as well, things about what we can achieve in terms of beauty, and communion, and transcendence.
 When my friend the doctor called to discuss Covid-19 symptoms with me, he didn't have much in the way of information that I didn't already know. I had Google, after all. I can read medical studies. And so little was known then that mostly it boiled down to: The disease would either continue to get worse, or it wouldn't. But a good conversation between two old friends is never simply about the exchange of information. There's a rhythm to it, an arc, an undercurrent of emotion and history that makes each exchange its own kind of story, a small, impermanent work of art. Here for a few puffs of breath, and then gone.
 Now that my wife and mother-in-law are recovered, I think of those moments at the end of my day with deep gratitude. The moments while my children cast magic spells born out of hope and fear, and the moments when my friend spoke to me of the science while I stood at my kitchen sink and softly wept, hearing little more complicated than one friend telling another, ''I love you, and I care for you, and I am here for you and those you love.'' Each night, after the spells were cast and the conversation was done, I felt more human, and more capable of performing the work ahead of me.

Protesters in Syracuse,organized underthe name Last Chance for Change, have marched for eight consecutive days in response to the killing of Floyd in Minneapolis. Floyd, a Black man, died after a white police officer knelt on his neck for several minutes. Derek Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd's neck, faces charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter. 
The three other officers present during Floyd's death have been arrested on charges of aiding and abetting murder. The demonstrations have been largely peaceful with the exception of the breaking of a courthouse window and looting of stores on May 30. Protesters have said they will march in the city for 40 days. 5 p.m. Protesters meet in a parking lot near East Adams Street. 4:42 p.m. One protester is reading the names of Syracuse residents who are victims of police brutality, including those who survived. The crowd holds a moment of silence as the names are read. 4:29 p.m. Syracuse resident Torrence Jackson shares his experience with police brutality. Jackson was forced to undergo a sigmoidoscopy — where an eight-inch tube was inserted into his rectum — to search for drugs, Syracuse.com reported in 2018. Jackson was put under general anesthesia for the search, which did not find any drugs present. Jackson was in the hospital for 14 hours for the procedure, he said. Police let him go the next day, he said. 'The hospital was arguing with the police about doing a procedure to me, right, and I'm telling them 'no,'' Jackson said. 'What about the community, they doing this to our kids too. I'm not the only person.' 4:06 p.m. Protesters stop and take a knee on West Washington Street, some with their fists raised. They linkarms as they continue t0 march, passing South Franklin Street. 3:56 p.m. The crowdis marching from curb to curb in downtown Syracuse. Some link arms as protesters begin to chant the names of Floyd and Breonna Taylor. 'The violence stops here y'all,' one protester said. 3:42 p.m. The crowd chants 'this is what democracy looks like,'as theypass the Onondaga County Sheriff's Office. 3:38 p.m. Organizers decide to march, chanting, 'no justice, no peace.'Another group turns onto South State Street to join the march as the crowd cheers. 3:28 p.m. Organizers are discussing their next moves. While the protesthas a greater attendance today than it may on any other day,Chaplin said they should consider organizers' safety. 'Our patience is thin, but it's a game,' Chaplin said. 'If we can take 40 days and get something done, and the rest of the nation can see how we did it, maybe this could start a trend.' 3:14 p.m Hundreds gather at theLast Chance for Change march in a park near East Adams Street.The crowd shares a moment of silence for 8 minutes and 46 seconds in honor of Floyd. The revolution has started and won't stop,Rev. H. Bernard Alex says to the crowd. People want the movement to be divided, but organizers won't split up, he said. 2:53 p.m. The crowd echoes the chants of an organizer,'It is our duty to fight for our freedom. It is our duty to win.' 'We must love and protect one another. We have nothing to lose but our chance,' they chant. The crowd at City Hall appears to be disbanding. 2:50 p.m. One organizer discusses elected officials'lack of action and justice.Everybody takes issue with looting, but the country wasbuilt on stolen land, theysaid. 'The money is there, the political will is not,'they said. 2:42p.m. Syracuse University student organizers with #NotAgainSU are attendingthe rally. The movement, led by Black students, formed in response to at least 32 hate crimes or hate incidents that have occurred at or near SU since early November. 2:36 p.m. The crowd shares a moment of silence, raising fists and signs. 'That was one minute,' a protester said after the moment of silence ends. Imagine not being able to breathe for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, like Floyd, they said. 2:22 p.m. Last Chance for Change organizers join the rally. Organizer Curtis Chaplin addresses the crowd, who raises their fists. He thanked Black Lives Matter for organizing the rally. 'I'm delighted to see this many people,' he said. 'We are marching for every single person in our city who has suffered from police brutality, who is still suffering from police brutality.' Last Chance for Change is marching for the 8th consecutive day as the Black Lives Matter rally continues at City Hall. 2:13 p.m. Emily NaPier Singletary of Unchained said her husband, a Black man, is serving 20 years in state prison. She discusses the parole system and those who have died in prisons and correctional facilities. She encourages the crowd to chant 'Black Lives Matter' loud enough for people in prisons to hear. 2:01 p.m. An organizer discusses the dangers her son, who has Downs syndrome, may encounter with police. 'We know that we have a militarized police force that never engages with us out of love,' they said. 'So imagine my son going down the street and somebody asks him to show him his ID, right? Imagine somebody stopping him and talking to him about where he was going.' All Black lives matter, the organizer said. 'If your revolution is not intersectional it's not a revolution,' they said.'When we engage with the criminal justice system, it's never just.' 1:36 p.m. Yusuf Abdul-Qadir of the New York Civil Liberties Union urges the crowd to 'stand firmly for justice.' 'Not partially, not kind of, not halfway, stand firmly for justice,' Abdul-Qadir said Abdul-Qadir later discussed New York Civil Rights Law 50-a. The law protects the performance evaluation records of police officers, fire fighters and corrections officers from being released. Following protests across the state, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has proposed legislation to make police personnel records more transparent. This country was built on the backs of Black people, Abdul-Qadir said. The community needs to radically change the role of police and remove them from society, he said. 1:25 p.m. One protester, who's a rising senior in high school, demands that the Syracuse City School District terminate its contract with the Syracuse Police Department and reject the use of metal detectors and surveillance technology. Counselors and teachers who represent marginalized identitieswould make them feel safe at school, the protester said. 'Look around, Syracuse. The young people have a voice,' Nitch Jones, an organizer, said. 'We're going to continue to back our young people, because they are leaders of today.' 1:04 p.m. Hundreds gather for the rally outside City Hall. Police officers, some wearing riot gear, block off several streets. Protesters on the steps of City Hall begin to sing 'Lift Every Voice and Sing' while some join in and cheer. 'Let us march on,' they sing. The post Live updates: Over 1,000 people march in Black Lives Matter protest[1] appeared first on The Daily Orange[2].

The Chair of Global Public Health at the University of Edinburgh said in a New York Times comment piece that being part of the UK is threatening Nicola Sturgeon's efforts to combat COVID-19.
The 36-year-old sits on the Scottish Government's COVID-19 Advisory Group.
Professor Sridhar said: ""Scotland and Northern Ireland have looked ahead at the coming winter, and made a concerted plan to minimise community transmission to avoid a serious resurgence of the virus by using the summer to drive cases as close to zero as possible and to reopen cautiously.
""But neither nation has control over its borders because they are parts of the United Kingdom.
""So both now face a stream of incoming infections from England and Wales, which are behaving more like the rest of Europe, as well as from people returning from holidays abroad and not abiding by government advice to isolate for 14 days.""
The academic also claims people who are returning to the UK should enter ""enforced isolation"".
She continued in the piece: ""Topping community transmission requires mandatory, enforced quarantine for incoming travellers and testing before release.
""Europe could do the same and cooperate across countries toward this goal so that intra-European travel and tourism can continue when a safe bubble can be built.""
Professor Sridhar also stressed that guidance imposed by the First Minister recommending people to only outside for a walk only once a day allowed Scotland to ""flatten the COVID-19 curve but to also keep levels of infection very low"".

The advisor previously apologised after criticism from Scottish Conservative MSPs for describing Unionists as ""anti-Scottish"" on Twitter.
Realising her mistake, Professor Sridhar deleted the ""inaccurate"" tweet and issued an apology, saying that she had meant anti-independence.

In March, when the first spike of Covid-19 cases in New York was filling hospitals and panicking the city, my immunocompromised mother-in-law and my eight-months pregnant wife both contracted the disease. At first, it was just like a bad cold, but soon my wife was crying in pain every time she coughed and my mother-in-law could barely get out of bed. As my mother-in-law’s oxygen levels ticked down day by day, I would listen to her breathing and wonder whether I should bring her to a hospital.
The idea terrified me. Two friends had parents on ventilators, both of whom would soon die. I didn’t want my mother-in-law away from the family that loved her, to disappear into the black hole of a hospital system where we wouldn’t be able to visit. Every night an old friend, Chris, a trauma surgeon in Philadelphia, would call me to discuss how the disease was progressing and whether it was still safe to have my mother-in-law at home. “In normal times, I’d say she should go to the hospital,” he told me at one point, “and if her oxygen dips any more, she has to.”
At the same time, I had to care for my two children, ages 2 and 4. They seemed OK, not talking much about the virus, excitedly cheering emergency medical workers each night and happily playing throughout the day. But every night they made me tell them the same bedtime story, in Spanish (reinforcing the language felt more important with my Colombian-American wife and mother-in-law terribly ill), about a frog and a butterfly on a quest to find the ingredients for a magic spell to cure “Mama Bruja” and “Abuela Nani Lobo.” They’d go deep into the forest in search of a rainbow-colored fly and the pollen from a rainbow-colored flower, which they would capture with their long, specially designed tongues. And then they’d bring the ingredients back, say the magic words, and dispel the sickness.
Each day, that was the ritual. I’d tell the story, put my children to bed, and then talk to Chris. On one level, bedtime with my children was an escape into the fantasy of storytelling, while Chris was giving me the certainty of scientific expertise most useful for the present moment. But back then there was little scientific certainty around, and so much of what Chris had to offer was something simpler and more human — an old friend carving out time to be with me each day, communicating concern and love and hope for my sick family members. In that way, it wasn’t so different from what was happening as my children and I recited magic words each night.
Stories are a quintessentially human method of responding to the chaos and uncertainty of the world. Science is a quintessentially human method of trying to control that chaos, and data is its raw material. Adrift in the world, uncertain of the future, hostage to fate, but possessed of increasingly powerful tools for carving up pieces of the world and putting them under the microscope, is it any wonder that we increasingly turn to science when looking for deliverance from our human predicaments?
Science, after all, will eventually bring us to the end of the pandemic, just as it has helped limit the damage through better treatments and proof of the benefits of wearing masks. “Science over fiction,” was one slogan of the Joe Biden campaign, a welcome message to those who’d like public policy tethered more to reality than political fantasy.
But because science supposedly gives clear answers about everything from how to open schools in a pandemic to who will be elected president, we tend to rush to embrace it as a panacea. Some, like the popular podcaster and author Sam Harris, even think science can answer moral questions. Rarely does it occur to us how often the invocation of “science” is used to mask value judgments, or political deliberation.
When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatricians released separate guidelines for reopening schools, the difference lay not in the underlying science but in their institutional priorities, one focused on disease spread and the other on the welfare of children. Likewise, the difference in how New York City handled the reopenings of day cares and schools reflected not simply science, but also what could be more easily demanded of workers who lacked the protection of a powerful union.
As much as we’d like to believe in “science over fiction,” decisions in the real world require negotiating between what we think the data means, what human value we’d like to assign to it and what stories about it we can get others to accept. Data alone is not knowledge, and it is certainly not wisdom. It rarely says as much as we think it does.
Yet its allure is undeniable, persistent. As I watched the election returns on Tuesday and Wednesday, I did so with the sinking feeling that I’d been fooled again by the lure of data. Even though it looked like Biden could still win, it was clear that those hard numbers I’d been absorbing for weeks, based on fine -tuned methodologies, correcting for past mistakes, aggregated to minimize chances of error, hadn’t come close to reflecting reality. “You are literally working on an essay about the problems with relying too much on data,” my wife told me the morning after the election, “and yet you were so confident in the polls.”
Mona Chalabi, a data journalist at The Guardian, is well aware of its shortcomings. “The biggest problem with data is pure arrogance,” she told me recently. Data can easily be misleading, inaccurate or irrelevant to the question at hand. She recounted how a decade ago, she was at a conference discussing reports she’d helped produce for the International Organization for Migration on the needs of internally displaced people and refugees in Iraq when a fellow attendee told her, “You do know all these numbers are wrong?” Or rather, not wrong, but incomplete. The reports relied on surveys that asked about blankets, food and shelter, but never about things like electricity generators, which were critical and sorely lacking. “It felt like an earthquake to have someone say, ‘Everything you think you know about this group of people is wrong.’”
These days she creates beautiful, sometimes whimsically hand-drawn charts and figures illustrating everything from the pricing of potential coronavirus treatments (with differing prices expressed by the height of pills floating above the pained, open mouths of women representing different countries at the bottom of the graph) to the percentage of interracial marriages in the United States (in which the flowing fabric of a woman’s wedding veil represents different types of interracial marriages over time).
“I illustrate data because I’m deeply skeptical of the data,” she says. “I want to remind people how many human biases go into it.” After all, it’s hard to look at a graph drawn by hand, in a deliberately artistic and emotional manner, and not see the human intentions lying behind it. This focus on the unreliability of our metrics keeps Ms. Chalabi shuttling between the data we have and the voices of those whose experiences don’t line up with the data.
“Anecdotes guide the questions I use to approach data,” she told me before bringing up oft-cited statistics on hate crimes against Muslims after 9/11. “Anecdotally, people are telling me that they experienced hate crimes, but they’re not reporting them,” she said. “So that leads me to ask if there are differences between reporting rates in different communities.” Does the data reveal real levels of discrimination, or distrust of a police force that has engaged in anti-Muslim discrimination itself?
“Data replicates systems of power,” she said, since the types of questions that get asked, and the sort of information deemed worthy of collection, often reflect the biases of the powerful. But people, unruly, free creatures that they are, tend to undermine those systems, for good and ill.
Last December, I traveled to Iraq with the United Nations refugee agency. It was my first time back in the country in over a decade, when I’d deployed as a young, idealistic lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps. Back then, data told a promising story. I was sitting in Anbar Province in September 2007 when Gen. David Petraeus testified to Congress about the progress there — the 45 percent decline in civilian deaths, 55 percent decline in sectarian killings, 445,000 Iraq security force members on the payroll, and so on.
Then I returned home and, over the intervening years, watched all the progress evaporate. Hundreds of thousands killed from war and genocide. Five and a half million displaced. Thousands enslaved and raped. Last December in Sinjar, where the Islamic State waged genocide against the Yazidi population, I saw an exquisite and sad mural of the silhouette of a man under an ISIS flag with the head and wings of a bird, his arms outstretched to the open sky, a chain around his ankle holding him down.
The next day, in the bombed-out center of Mosul, near a mural of a boy lifting up a curtain of rubble to reveal a rainbow of colors, I met a man whose shattered house the United Nations Development Project was restoring. He’d sheltered there with his children in the final days of the battle against ISIS. “We were trapped,” he told me. “We ate cats, rats. For water you had to risk your life to go to the river where the soldiers would shoot at you. We collected rainwater to drink. There were days my children were so hungry, and there was shelling and shooting, and I just wanted to rescue them.” No data could capture what this experience meant, or what I, an American citizen, owed in response.
The projects carried out by the U.N. agencies there tended to focus on meeting immediate, local needs, informed by decades of failed reconstruction efforts, sophisticated, data-rich reports on what types of assistance were most necessary and feedback from their local Iraqi partners. But the largest reconstruction project we saw there, and also the one the local Moslawis with us seemed most proud of, had little to do with such hardheaded pragmatism.
This was the reconstruction, backed by UNESCO and the United Arab Emirates, of the al-Nuri Grand Mosque, the 12th-century mosque and symbol of the city destroyed by ISIS in 2017. As we walked through rubble that was being carefully sorted by construction workers into the original seven bands of stone that made up the old minaret, I made out profane anti-ISIS graffiti on some of the still standing pillars. Amused, I asked a Moslawi man who’d written it. “C.T.S.,” he said sadly, referring to Iraqi special forces. “It would not have been a Moslawi, because we would respect what has been left behind.”
When so many were homeless, living in camps, and when the resources of the humanitarian community were stretched beyond limits by a lack of interest in Iraq and in the suffering of Iraqis, to see a $50 million project focusing on a cultural site might seem strange or unpractical — though only if you think culture and art and man’s search for transcendence aren’t as essential to humanity as more quantifiable needs.
“Human life has always been lived on the edge of a precipice,” wrote C.S. Lewis on the eve of World War II. “If men had postponed the search for knowledge and beauty until they were secure, the search would never have begun.” And whether we like it or not, that search yields beauty far more regularly than it has ever yielded any kind of scientific mastery over our fates.
We want the comfort of certainty. Millenniums of human art tell us that certainty is not for us, that God only answers Job from the whirlwind, and only answers him with more questions. But millenniums of human art tell us other things as well, things about what we can achieve in terms of beauty, and communion, and transcendence.
When my friend the doctor called to discuss Covid-19 symptoms with me, he didn’t have much in the way of information that I didn’t already know. I had Google, after all. I can read medical studies. And so little was known then that mostly it boiled down to: The disease would either continue to get worse, or it wouldn’t. But a good conversation between two old friends is never simply about the exchange of information. There’s a rhythm to it, an arc, an undercurrent of emotion and history that makes each exchange its own kind of story, a small, impermanent work of art. Here for a few puffs of breath, and then gone.
Now that my wife and mother-in-law are recovered, I think of those moments at the end of my day with deep gratitude. The moments while my children cast magic spells born out of hope and fear, and the moments when my friend spoke to me of the science while I stood at my kitchen sink and softly wept, hearing little more complicated than one friend telling another, “I love you, and I care for you, and I am here for you and those you love.” Each night, after the spells were cast and the conversation was done, I felt more human, and more capable of performing the work ahead of me.

One victim, James Chaney, was Black and a local resident. The other two were white Jews from New York City, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner.
The Freedom Summer Murders they were called, in a U.S.A. a-roil with protests and demonstrations, rather like now. The young men were working to register African-Americans to vote.
It is often forgotten now how deeply entwined American Jews were with the civil rights movement and the struggle to obtain equal rights for Blacks under the law.
""Is Labour Anti-Semitic?"" was the name of an investigative Panorama documentary that aired on the BBC a year ago which probed allegations made by seven whistleblowers about widespread anti-Semitism within the Labour Party during the years it was led by Jeremy Corbyn.
A party founded in part a century ago by the Jewish Labour Movement, then known as Poale Zion, in the United Kingdom. Working-class Jews at the time flocked to Labour as the party which reflected the hopes and aspirations of a largely impoverished migrant community but also for Labour's deep and defining commitment to a Jewish state.
It is often forgotten now how deeply entwined British Jews have been with the very essence of the Labour Party. A party that, in the Corbyn era, was plagued by accusations of anti-Semitism masquerading as anti-Zionism, expressed in virulence towards Israel, the nation that Labour had once proudly extolled.
Apologies for anti-Semitism are in the wind.
From Labour's new leader Keir Starmer, who three weeks ago sacked a front bench MP, shadow education secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey, for sharing a Jewish conspiracy theory that the knee-on-neck restraint which killed George Floyd had been taught to American law enforcement by the Israeli Defense Forces.
To TV host and producer Nick Cannon, with a lengthy if lame Facebook post following a podcast with controversial hip-hop figure Richard ""Professor Griff"" Griffin, in which Cannon amplified Griff's views that Jewish people controlled the music industry and the media, likening it to the power of the Rothschild banking family. Really, nothing more than a modern version of the Protocols of Zion, a 19th-century hoax purporting to be the confidential minutes of a Jewish conclave plotting to take over the world.
Cannon said approvingly that Griff was ""speaking facts,"" praised Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan and his ideology, and insisted Black people are the ""true Hebrews.""
""It's never hate speech,"" he said. ""You can't be anti-Semitic when we are the Semitic people, when we are the same people who they want to be. That's our birthright. We are the true Hebrews.""
Somebody give Cannon a copy of ""Anti-Semitism for Dummies.""
The comedian, actor and former host of ""America's Got Talent"" - a one-man entertainment dynamo - was axed by ViacomCBS last week amidst an angry backlash, after which he tweeted: ""I hurt an entire community and it pained me to my core. I thought it couldn't get any worse. Then I watched my own community turn on me and call me a sellout for apologizing. Goodnight. Enjoy Earth.''
Because some in the Black community bravely took Cannon to task. It can't be easy, especially in these tumultuous times of global protest over policy brutality, racial inequality and Black Lives Matter fighting for the dignity of a people, to assail a Black individual who has achieved mass cultural fame.
ViacomCBS, which also owns MTV, where Cannon's celebrity sketch series ""Wild 'N Out"" has been a fixture since 2005, issued a statement saying the company ""condemns bigotry of any kind and we categorically denounce all forms of anti-Semitism.
""We have spoken with Nick Cannon about an episode of the podcast ""Cannon's Class"" on YouTube, which promoted hateful speech and spread anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. While we support ongoing education and dialogue in the fight against bigotry, we are deeply troubled that Nick has failed to acknowledge or apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism, and we are terminating our relationship with him.""
Cannon tried again with the forelock-tugging, even while charging ViacomCBS with being ""on the wrong side of history.""
""I don't blame any individual. I blame the oppressive and racist infrastructure,"" he said on Facebook. ""System racism is what the world was built on and was the subject in which I was attempting to highlight in the recent clips that have been circulating from my podcast. If I have furthered the hate speech, I wholeheartedly apologize.""
Then he got his sorry around to the Jews. ""I must apologize to my Jewish Brothers and Sister for putting them in such a painful position, which was never my intention, but I know this whole situation has hurt many people and together we will make it right.""
Rabbis and others in the Jewish community have, with admirable generosity of spirit, been ""educating"" Cannon on history. Perhaps they told him about Rabbi Joachim Prinz, whose involvement with the civil rights movement in the 1960s culminated in his ""Silence"" address at the 1963 March on Washington, delivered just before Martin Luther King gave his ""I Have a Dream"" speech"">.
Cannon is not a stupid man. That's what made his ignorance so profound. And there was nothing ""inadvertent"" about it.
He is just, however, one pathetic fool.
How to explain an entire political party going anti-Semitically off the rails, as happened to Labour with Corbyn at the helm?
Under his leadership, radically left membership pulled Labour towards increasingly venomous criticism of Israel, which is entirely legitimate as long as it doesn't indulge in hatred toward a people rather than a government or indulge in anti-Semitic tropes. Such as former London mayor Ken Livingston claiming during several interviews that Adolf Hitler supported Zionism. Anti-Semitic incidents just kept piling up and many Jews no longer felt comfortable under the Labour umbrella.
Labour became so embroiled in accusations of anti-Semitism that prominent human rights activist Shami Chakrabarti was asked to investigate claims of widespread anti-Semitism within the party. She exonerated Labour but uncovered an ""occasionally toxic atmosphere."" Many viewed her report as a whitewash. (Chakrabarti was given a peerage by Labour mere months after it was published.)
Last year saw a number of high-profile resignations of MPs and peers over anti-Semitism, including the Jewish MP Luciana Berger. The Equality and Human Rights Commission placed the party under formal investigation over whether it had unlawfully discriminated against, harassed or victimized people because they were Jewish. (The findings have yet to be released.)
There was an endless row over whether the party should adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance of anti-Semitism, which it ended up ultimately approving.
Then the whistleblowers spoke to Panorama, saying they felt there was political meddling from Corby's office in the process for handling anti-Semitism complaints - of which there were hundreds and hundreds.
The Guardian reported last week that Labour is poised to formally apologize to the whistleblowers, who afterwards sued the party for defamation - they'd claimed senior party officials had issued statements attacking their reputations and that their intent was to undermine the party - as part of a settlement to put their crisis behind them.
In last December's general election, Corbyn led Labour to its worst result in nearly a century.
Immediately after Starmer replaced Corby as leader in April, he held a video conference promising to set up an independent complaints process and outlining steps to stamp out anti-Semitism within Labour.
""It was very important to me to seek to address the disgrace of anti-Semitism in our party,"" he said.
""Over the last few years, we have failed the Jewish community on anti-Semitism. Labour is a proudly anti-racist party and, going forward, it will not be enough to 'past the test' on anti-Semitism.""
Canadians should not view all these controversies and scandals as foreign to us. Jews were this country's most targeted minority for hate crimes in 2018, according to data released in February by Statistics Canada, despite their small population. And a breakdown of hate-crime incidents revealed last month by Toronto police found 44 out of 139 hate-related incidents in 2019 targeted the Jewish community - 32 per cent of all hate crimes.
Earlier this year, a Zoom prayer service at Shaarei Shomayin synagogue was hijacked by trolls, screaming, ""Gas chambers!"" and ""Hitler was right!""
Pandemic or pogroms, there's never been a time when Jew-hatred has not thrived.

157,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1001/Files (250).DOCX","US Fed News",2020-07-15,"817 words",NA,NA,NA,"CHAIRWOMAN LOWEY STATEMENT AT FULL COMMITTEE MARKUP OF FY 2021 HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING BILL",FALSE,"WASHINGTON, D.C., July 15 -- The House Appropriations Committee issued the following press release:
Congresswoman Nita M. Lowey (D-NY), Chair of the House Appropriations Committee, delivered the following remarks at the Committee's markup of the fiscal year 2021 Homeland Security bill:
I commend Chairwoman Roybal-Allard and Ranking Member Fleischmann for their admirable work on this bill in a year of unprecedented challenges. I thank the staff for their hard work to help craft the bill before us.
In the Congress, we have a special and urgent responsibility to provide the necessary resources that are critical to our security, and to respond quickly and effectively to new and emerging threats.
Since I first arrived in Congress nearly 32 years ago, and in particular after joining the Homeland subcommittee in 2007, I have been committed to doing everything possible to ensure our constituents in every corner of America are safe and secure.
We don't agree on everything in this bill, but as I reflect on this Committee's work, there is a remarkable and bipartisan track record of funding the evolving homeland security needs of our country. We have strengthened our security over the years by:
* Investing in the capabilities of first responders;
* Rebuilding after disasters like Superstorm Sandy;
* Supporting local social service organizations that provide food and shelter to at-risk members of our communities;
* Enhancing aviation security; and
* Preventing and better responding to acts of terror and hate.
Nearly two decades have passed since September 11th when nearly 3,000 Americans lost their lives, including more than one hundred of my own constituents.
When I learned that first responders were unable to communicate with one another, reducing the effectiveness of the response on that tragic day, I introduced the CONNECT First Responders Act, and we created a $150 million grant program and an office at the Department of Homeland Security to ensure ineffective communications never again obstruct emergency response teams working to save lives.
We have made important progress over the years, but America is still not as safe as it should be. The sad reality is that we have seen a shocking increase in anti-Semitism and violent hate crimes in the last few years.
Three years ago, I established a $10 million non-profit security grant program for those outside of Urban Area Security Initiative - or UASI - regions.
This meant that non-profits outside of major metropolitan areas, like those in Rockland County, New York, could better protect themselves with increased security capabilities and have greater peace of mind. In FY 2020, this Committee successfully quadrupled that funding level to $40 million.
Shortly after the FY 2020 spending bill was enacted, a tragic, hate-filled stabbing took place in my district during a Hanukkah celebration. That anti-Semitic attack in Rockland is not an anomaly. What we are experiencing can only be called an epidemic of hate.
While non-profit security grants are not a panacea, I am optimistic that the combined $360 million this mark includes for UASI and non-UASI non-profit security grants could greatly help to prevent future attacks, particularly those aimed at racial, ethnic, or religious minorities.
This bill also addresses other growing crises.
The toll of the coronavirus pandemic is unprecedented. As a nation, we have lost more than 138,000 lives due to COVID-19, more than 18 percent of whom were New Yorkers. Our first responders continue to go above and beyond, many making the ultimate sacrifice in service to their communities and country.
These last several months have made it clear that we must do more to safeguard the American people from the real manmade and natural threats we face.
To that end, the mark includes $10.6 billion for FEMA, including $5.6 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund and $3.6 billion for Federal Assistance programs, such as the Assistance to Firefighters Grant program and the Emergency Food and Shelter Program.
This bill as a whole will strengthen our security and keep Americans safe while upholding our American values of fairness and respect. Strong investments in modern, effective technologies will improve homeland security missions, from cybersecurity and disaster preparedness to border and maritime security.
It also provides resources to meet the humanitarian needs of migrants and, critically, it prohibits the administration from raiding funds for the President's wasteful border wall.
Again, I thank Chairwoman Roybal-Allard and Ranking Member Fleischmann for their work and would like to recognize the Homeland Security Subcommittee Majority staff led by Darek Newby and my Congressional office staffer, Fae Rabin and former staffer Jennifer Becker-Pollet.

Goodman and Michael Schwerner.
The Freedom Summer Murders they were called, in a U.S.A. a-roil with protests and demonstrations, rather like now. The young men were working to register African-Americans to vote.
It is often forgotten now how deeply entwined American Jews were with the civil rights movement and the struggle to obtain equal rights for Blacks under the law.
""Is Labour Anti-Semitic?"" was the name of an investigative Panorama documentary that aired on the BBC a year ago which probed allegations made by seven whistleblowers about widespread anti-Semitism within the Labour Party during the years it was led by Jeremy Corbyn.
A party founded in part a century ago by the Jewish Labour Movement, then known as Poale Zion, in the United Kingdom. Working-class Jews at the time flocked to Labour as the party which reflected the hopes and
aspirations of a largely impoverished migrant community but also for Labour's deep and defining commitment to a Jewish state.
It is often forgotten now how deeply entwined British Jews have been with the very essence of the Labour Party. A party that, in the Corbyn era, was plagued by accusations of anti-Semitism masquerading as anti-Zionism, expressed in virulence towards Israel, the nation that Labour had once proudly extolled.
Apologies for anti-Semitism are in the wind.
From Labour's new leader Keir Starmer, who three weeks ago sacked a front bench MP, shadow education secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey, for sharing a Jewish conspiracy theory that the knee-on-neck restraint which killed George Floyd had been taught to American law enforcement by the Israeli Defense Forces.
To TV host and producer Nick Cannon, with a lengthy if lame Facebook post following a podcast with controversial hip-hop figure Richard ""Professor Griff"" Griffin, in which Cannon amplified Griff's views that Jewish people controlled the music industry and the media, likening it to the power of the Rothschild banking family. Really, nothing more than a modern version of the Protocols of Zion, a 19th-century hoax purporting to be the confidential minutes of a Jewish conclave plotting to take over the world.
Cannon said approvingly that Griff was ""speaking facts,"" praised Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan and his ideology, and insisted Black people are the ""true Hebrews.""
""It's never hate speech,"" he said. ""You can't be anti-Semitic when we are the Semitic people, when we are the same people who they want to be. That's our birthright. We are the true Hebrews.""
Somebody give Cannon a copy of ""Anti-Semitism for Dummies.""
The comedian, actor and former host of ""America's Got Talent"" - a one-man entertainment dynamo - was axed by ViacomCBS last week amidst an angry backlash, after which he tweeted: ""I hurt an entire community and it pained me to my core. I thought it couldn't get any worse. Then I watched my own community turn on me and call me a sellout for apologizing. Goodnight. Enjoy Earth.''
Because some in the Black community bravely took Cannon to task. It can't be easy, especially in these tumultuous times of global protest over policy brutality, racial inequality and Black Lives Matter fighting for the dignity of a people, to assail a Black individual who has achieved mass cultural fame.
ViacomCBS, which also owns MTV, where Cannon's celebrity sketch series ""Wild 'N Out"" has been a fixture since 2005, issued a statement saying the company ""condemns bigotry of any kind and we categorically denounce all forms of anti-Semitism.
""We have spoken with Nick Cannon about an episode of the podcast ""Cannon's Class"" on YouTube, which promoted hateful speech and spread anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. While we support ongoing education and dialogue in the fight against bigotry, we are deeply troubled that Nick has failed to acknowledge or apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism, and we are terminating our relationship with him.""
Cannon tried again with the forelock-tugging, even while charging ViacomCBS with being ""on the wrong side of history.""
""I don't blame any individual. I blame the oppressive and racist infrastructure,"" he said on Facebook. ""System racism is what the world was built on and was the subject in which I was attempting to highlight in the recent clips that have been circulating from my podcast. If I have furthered the hate speech, I wholeheartedly apologize.""
Then he got his sorry around to the Jews. ""I must apologize to my Jewish Brothers and Sister for putting them in such a painful position, which was never my intention, but I know this whole situation has hurt many people and together we will make it right.""
Rabbis and others in the Jewish community have, with admirable generosity of spirit, been ""educating"" Cannon on history. Perhaps they told him about Rabbi Joachim Prinz, who's involvement with the civil rights movement in the 1960s culminated in his ""Silence"" address at the 1963 March on Washington, delivered just before Martin Luther King gave his ""I Have a Dream"" speech.
Cannon is not a stupid man. That's what made his ignorance so profound. And there was nothing ""inadvertent"" about it.
He is just, however, one pathetic fool.
How to explain an entire political party going anti-Semitically off the rails, as happened to Labour with Corbyn at the helm?
Under his leadership, radically left membership pulled Labour towards increasingly venomous criticism of Israel, which is entirely legitimate as long as it doesn't indulge in hatred toward a people rather than a government or indulge in anti-Semitic tropes. Such as former London mayor Ken Livingston claiming during several interviews that Adolf Hitler supported Zionism. Anti-Semitic incidents just kept piling up and many Jews no longer felt comfortable under the Labour umbrella.
Labour became so embroiled in accusations of anti-Semitism that prominent human rights activist Shami Chakrabarti was asked to investigate claims of widespread anti-Semitism within the party. She exonerated Labour but uncovered an ""occasionally toxic atmosphere."" Many viewed her report as a whitewash. (Chakrabarti was given a peerage by Labour mere months after it was published.)
Last year saw a number of high-profile resignations of MPs and peers over anti-Semitism, including the Jewish MP Luciana Berger. The Equality and Human Rights Commission placed the party under formal investigation over whether it had unlawfully discriminated against, harassed or victimized people because they were Jewish. (The findings have yet to be released.)
There was an endless row over whether the party should adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance of anti-Semitism, which it ended up ultimately approving.
Then the whistleblowers spoke to Panorama, saying they felt there was political meddling from Corby's office in the process for handling anti-Semitism complaints - of which there were hundreds and hundreds.
The Guardian reported last week that Labour is poised to formally apologize to the whistleblowers, who afterwards sued the party for defamation - they'd claimed senior party officials had issued statements attacking their reputations and that their intent was to undermine the party - as part of a settlement to put their crisis behind them.
In last December's general election, Corbyn led Labour to its worst result in nearly a century.
Immediately after Starmer replaced Corby as leader in April, he held a video conference promising to set up an independent complaints process and outlining steps to stamp out anti-Semitism within Labour.
""It was very important to me to seek to address the disgrace of anti-Semitism in our party,"" he said.
""Over the last few years, we have failed the Jewish community on anti-Semitism. Labour is a proudly anti-racist party and, going forward, it will not be enough to 'past the test' on anti-Semitism.""
Canadians should not view all these controversies and scandals as foreign to us. Jews were this country's most targeted minority for hate crimes in 2018, according to data released in February by Statistics Canada, despite their small population. And a breakdown of hate-crime incidents revealed last month by Toronto police found 44 out of 139 hate-related incidents in 2019 targeted the Jewish community - 32 per cent of all hate crimes.
Earlier this year, a Zoom prayer service at Shaarei Shomayin synagogue was hijacked by trolls, screaming, ""Gas chambers!"" and ""Hitler was right!""

162,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1001/Files (250).DOCX","Jpost.com (The Jerusalem Post online edition)",2020-12-14,"961 words",NA,"KENNETH BANDLER",NA,"How can rising online antisemitism be stopped? - opinion",FALSE,"In the constantly expanding digital universe, purveyors of hate are exploiting the newest communications technologies to threaten Jews.
The deleterious impact of the ""digitization of antisemitism"" was revealed in the 2020 State of Antisemitism in America report recently issued by the American Jewish Committee (AJC).
 Twenty-two percent of American Jewish adults have experienced antisemitism online or on social media in the last five years. Of this group, 62% said they had been the targets of antisemitic remarks on Facebook, 33% on Twitter, 12% on Instagram and 10% on YouTube.
The impact of hate Jews are experiencing online mirrors the experience with more traditional forms of antisemitism. While 24% say they avoid wearing, carrying or displaying things that might identify them as Jews, and 31% avoid certain places, events or situations out of concern for their safety, the AJC survey also found that 24% who are active on social media avoid posting content that may identify them as Jewish.
""We all need to send the message that antisemitism in any form is unacceptable on or offline,"" Holly Huffnagle, AJC's US director for combating antisemitism, told the Inter-parliamentary Task Force on Online Antisemitism last month.
Findings in AJC's second annual comprehensive survey of US Jewish perceptions of and experiences with antisemitism in the United States reflect the fast-moving changes in how antisemitism is transmitted.
""Digitization of antisemitism is the farthest-reaching battleground. What happens online doesn't stay online,"" says Huffnagle, recalling that the hate-filled individuals who carried out the murderous assaults at Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue and Chabad of Poway posted threatening manifestos shortly before their attacks.
 cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });if(window.location.pathname.indexOf(""647856"") != -1) {console.log(""hedva connatix"");document.getElementsByClassName(""divConnatix"")[0].style.display =""none""}
One essential tool to combat antisemitism is keeping law enforcement informed. But 76% of American Jews who have experienced an antisemitic incident do not report it at all, and only 4% tell the police.
This reluctance concerns top law enforcement officials across the country. ""You are going to lose every case you do not charge,"" Ohio Attorney-General Dave Yost said on an AJC Advocacy Anywhere program, in an appeal to ""victims of hate crimes who have declined to report because they feel nothing is going to happen.""
But a perceived lack of responsiveness also may inhibit willingness to report. Nearly half (46%) of American Jews who reported online antisemitism to a social media platform said that nothing was done to address the incident. 
THE AMASSING of hate, and specifically antisemitism, online demands attention and action by the leaders of the technology giants. The creators of top social media platforms may have begun with good intentions pioneering global communications, but as some veteran social media executives admitted in the Netflix documentary, The Social Dilemma, the consequences of people and groups imbued with hate and limitless reach were underestimated or ignored.
""Freedom of speech must never be confused with freedom to incite violence and hatred,"" New York Attorney-General Letitia James said on the AJC program where Yost appeared.
Putting the evil social media genie back in the bottle is an enormous challenge. Facebook, for one, has taken steps to ban certain antisemitic stereotypes as well as Holocaust denial and distortion. It's a methodical process, relying heavily on human moderators, who can follow-up on what the algorithms are missing.
""Facebook has two billion users worldwide, but 90% of them do not live in the United States and Canada,"" Monika Bickert, Facebook's vice president of content policy, explained on a recent AJC Advocacy Anywhere program. Training moderators to identify what constitutes antisemitic posts is imperative.
But users also need to learn what is antisemitic, and whether they are engaging in it online or offline. AJC's survey of the general American population, also part of the State of Antisemitism in America report, found that only 53% of Americans are familiar with the term ""antisemitism."" Another 25% acknowledged that they do not know what the word means even though they said they have heard it, and 21% said they had never heard the term ""antisemitism.""
The correlation between awareness and education level is pronounced. Thirty-six percent of those with a high school diploma or less, 14% with some college, and 9% with a college degree were among the 21% who are totally unaware of the term antisemitism.
While 82% of American Jews said antisemitism in the US has increased over the past five years, 47% of the general population who have completed at least some college agreed, compared with 36% of those with less education.
In the US, the adage ""what begins with Jews doesn't end with Jews,"" is not resonating throughout American society, even though some elected officials, religious and ethnic leaders have recognized and declared that antisemitism is a problem for all to address.
Ignorance is a significant obstacle to developing and implementing concrete actions aimed at containing and pushing back the proliferation of antisemitism. Those involved in the business of education, including social media firms, should lead in making the battle against antisemitism a national priority.

The governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras have failed to effectively address violence and entrenched discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people, leading many to seek asylum in the United States, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. Yet policies by the administration of US President Donald Trump have made it almost impossible for them to obtain asylum.
The 138-page report, “‘Every Day I Live in Fear’: Violence and Discrimination against LGBT People in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, and Obstacles to Asylum in the United States,” documents violence experienced by LGBT people in the three Northern Central American countries collectively known as the Northern Triangle, including at the hands of gangs, law enforcement officials, and their own families. Human Rights Watch found that Northern Triangle governments fail to adequately protect LGBT people against violence and discrimination, and that they face major obstacles if they attempt to seek asylum in the United States.
“LGBT people in the Northern Triangle face high levels of violence that their own governments appear unable or unwilling to address,” said Neela Ghoshal, senior LGBT rights researcher at Human Rights Watch. “For some LGBT people in the region, seeking asylum in the United States is the only hope of safety, but the Trump administration has blocked them at every turn.”
Human Rights Watch interviewed 116 LGBT people from the three countries. Some described violence by family members, leading them to flee home as young as at age 8. Others described bullying and discrimination that drove them out of school. Many said family rejection and discrimination led to economic marginalization, particularly for trans women, and poverty was likely to increase the risk of violence.
LGBT people sometimes face violence and discrimination from the very law enforcement agents charged with keeping them safe. Carlos G., a gay refugee who traveled to the United States from Honduras in 2018, said that gang members there shot him, telling him: “Today you’re going to die, faggot.” He was afraid to report the incident to the police, who had previously harassed him for being gay and demanded sexual favors. Carlitos B., a non-binary person from Guatemala, fled after their brother assaulted and threatened to rape them. When Carlitos reported to the police, they laughed at Carlitos’s gender expression.
Pricila P., a trans woman from El Salvador, said police forced her off a bus and beat her. “One of the police officers grabbed my testicles and squeezed,” she said. “He said, ‘You’re realizing you’re a man because you feel pain.’ He said that I would become a man by force.” She fled to the United States in 2019, after gang members assaulted her, abducted her gay friend, and warned her that she would be next.
Both Honduras and El Salvador have passed hate crimes legislation in the last 10 years, but neither country has convicted anyone on hate crimes charges. In a landmark ruling in July 2020, a court in El Salvador convicted three police officers of murdering Camila Díaz, a trans woman who had been deported in 2018 after attempting to seek protection in the United States, but a judge dismissed hate crimes charges against them.
None of the three countries has comprehensive civil law protections against discrimination, Human Rights Watch said. While Honduras outlaws employment discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity, activists said they know of no cases in which the law had been enforced. In Guatemala, a pending Life and Family Protection Bill could be used to justify discriminatory denial of services on “freedom of conscience” grounds.
Given the persecution that many LGBT people face in the Northern Triangle, the US government should rigorously protect their ability to safely enter the United States and apply for asylum. Instead, the US government has increasingly closed doors to them with a series of policies that restrict access to asylum and that narrowly interpret the refugee definition in ways that exclude LGBT people from protections they previously enjoyed.
In March 2020, the US government entirely closed its land borders to asylum seekers based on the pretext of Covid-19, leaving them to suffer persecution in their home countries or be stranded in Mexico. In June, the US Departments of Justice and Homeland Security proposed a major regulatory change to the US asylum system that would severely restrict LGBT people’s ability to be granted asylum by barring asylum on the basis of “gender.” In September, the Justice Department issued yet another regulation that puts asylum even further beyond their reach, tightening time limits on asylum applications and allowing immigration judges to introduce their own evidence into asylum cases, even if such evidence reflects biases such as anti-LGBT prejudice.
These policies followed other severe measures the Trump administration has taken to prevent asylum seekers from ever reaching the United States and to limit their access to asylum if they do, including family separation; prolonged detention; the “Remain in Mexico” program; an expedited asylum review process allowing for little or no contact with lawyers; an attempt to bar asylum seekers who transited through third countries before arriving at the US border; and a policy of transferring Salvadoran and Honduran asylum seekers to Guatemala, where they lack effective protection. Among the asylum seekers affected by all these measures are LGBT people, who may be particularly at risk of violence and discrimination in northern Mexico.
“The governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras need to stem rampant anti-LGBT violence and ensure that laws and policies protect LGBT people from persecution, including by police,” Ghoshal said. “As long as LGBT people continue to experience threats to their lives and safety based on their identity in their countries of origin, the US should welcome them with open arms, rather than slamming the door on them.”"

One victim, James Chaney, was Black and a local resident. The other two were white Jews from New York City, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner.
The Freedom Summer Murders they were called, in a U.S.A. a-roil with protests and demonstrations, rather like now. The young men were working to register African-Americans to vote.
It is often forgotten now how deeply entwined American Jews were with the civil rights movement and the struggle to obtain equal rights for Blacks under the law.
""Is Labour Anti-Semitic?"" was the name of an investigative Panorama documentary that aired on the BBC a year ago which probed allegations made by seven whistleblowers about widespread anti-Semitism within the Labour Party during the years it was led by Jeremy Corbyn.
A party founded in part a century ago by the Jewish Labour Movement, then known as Poale Zion, in the United Kingdom. Working-class Jews at the time flocked to Labour as the party which reflected the hopes and aspirations of a largely impoverished migrant community but also for Labour's deep and defining commitment to a Jewish state.
It is often forgotten now how deeply entwined British Jews have been with the very essence of the Labour Party. A party that, in the Corbyn era, was plagued by accusations of anti-Semitism masquerading as anti-Zionism, expressed in virulence towards Israel, the nation that Labour had once proudly extolled.
Apologies for anti-Semitism are in the wind.
From Labour's new leader Keir Starmer, who three weeks ago sacked a front bench MP, shadow education secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey, for sharing a Jewish conspiracy theory that the knee-on-neck restraint which killed George Floyd had been taught to American law enforcement by the Israeli Defense Forces.
To TV host and producer Nick Cannon, with a lengthy if lame Facebook post following a podcast with controversial hip-hop figure Richard ""Professor Griff"" Griffin, in which Cannon amplified Griff's views that Jewish people controlled the music industry and the media, likening it to the power of the Rothschild banking family. Really, nothing more than a modern version of the Protocols of Zion, a 19th-century hoax purporting to be the confidential minutes of a Jewish conclave plotting to take over the world.
Cannon said approvingly that Griff was ""speaking facts,"" praised Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan and his ideology, and insisted Black people are the ""true Hebrews.""
""It's never hate speech,"" he said. ""You can't be anti-Semitic when we are the Semitic people, when we are the same people who they want to be. That's our birthright. We are the true Hebrews.""
Somebody give Cannon a copy of ""Anti-Semitism for Dummies.""
The comedian, actor and former host of ""America's Got Talent"" - a one-man entertainment dynamo - was axed by ViacomCBS last week amidst an angry backlash, after which he tweeted: ""I hurt an entire community and it pained me to my core. I thought it couldn't get any worse. Then I watched my own community turn on me and call me a sellout for apologizing. Goodnight. Enjoy Earth.''
Because some in the Black community bravely took Cannon to task. It can't be easy, especially in these tumultuous times of global protest over policy brutality, racial inequality and Black Lives Matter fighting for the dignity of a people, to assail a Black individual who has achieved mass cultural fame.
ViacomCBS, which also owns MTV, where Cannon's celebrity sketch series ""Wild 'N Out"" has been a fixture since 2005, issued a statement saying the company ""condemns bigotry of any kind and we categorically denounce all forms of anti-Semitism.
""We have spoken with Nick Cannon about an episode of the podcast ""Cannon's Class"" on YouTube, which promoted hateful speech and spread anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. While we support ongoing education and dialogue in the fight against bigotry, we are deeply troubled that Nick has failed to acknowledge or apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism, and we are terminating our relationship with him.""
Cannon tried again with the forelock-tugging, even while charging ViacomCBS with being ""on the wrong side of history.""
""I don't blame any individual. I blame the oppressive and racist infrastructure,"" he said on Facebook. ""System racism is what the world was built on and was the subject in which I was attempting to highlight in the recent clips that have been circulating from my podcast. If I have furthered the hate speech, I wholeheartedly apologize.""
Then he got his sorry around to the Jews. ""I must apologize to my Jewish Brothers and Sister for putting them in such a painful position, which was never my intention, but I know this whole situation has hurt many people and together we will make it right.""
Rabbis and others in the Jewish community have, with admirable generosity of spirit, been ""educating"" Cannon on history. Perhaps they told him about Rabbi Joachim Prinz, whose involvement with the civil rights movement in the 1960s culminated in his ""Silence"" address at the 1963 March on Washington, delivered just before Martin Luther King gave his ""I Have a Dream"" speech.
Cannon is not a stupid man. That's what made his ignorance so profound. And there was nothing ""inadvertent"" about it.
He is just, however, one pathetic fool.
How to explain an entire political party going anti-Semitically off the rails, as happened to Labour with Corbyn at the helm?
Under his leadership, radically left membership pulled Labour towards increasingly venomous criticism of Israel, which is entirely legitimate as long as it doesn't indulge in hatred toward a people rather than a government or indulge in anti-Semitic tropes. Such as former London mayor Ken Livingston claiming during several interviews that Adolf Hitler supported Zionism. Anti-Semitic incidents just kept piling up and many Jews no longer felt comfortable under the Labour umbrella.
Labour became so embroiled in accusations of anti-Semitism that prominent human rights activist Shami Chakrabarti was asked to investigate claims of widespread anti-Semitism within the party. She exonerated Labour but uncovered an ""occasionally toxic atmosphere."" Many viewed her report as a whitewash. (Chakrabarti was given a peerage by Labour mere months after it was published.)
Last year saw a number of high-profile resignations of MPs and peers over anti-Semitism, including the Jewish MP Luciana Berger. The Equality and Human Rights Commission placed the party under formal investigation over whether it had unlawfully discriminated against, harassed or victimized people because they were Jewish. (The findings have yet to be released.)
There was an endless row over whether the party should adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance of anti-Semitism, which it ended up ultimately approving.
Then the whistleblowers spoke to Panorama, saying they felt there was political meddling from Corby's office in the process for handling anti-Semitism complaints - of which there were hundreds and hundreds.
The Guardian reported last week that Labour is poised to formally apologize to the whistleblowers, who afterwards sued the party for defamation - they'd claimed senior party officials had issued statements attacking their reputations and that their intent was to undermine the party - as part of a settlement to put their crisis behind them.
In last December's general election, Corbyn led Labour to its worst result in nearly a century.
Immediately after Starmer replaced Corby as leader in April, he held a video conference promising to set up an independent complaints process and outlining steps to stamp out anti-Semitism within Labour.
""It was very important to me to seek to address the disgrace of anti-Semitism in our party,"" he said.
""Over the last few years, we have failed the Jewish community on anti-Semitism. Labour is a proudly anti-racist party and, going forward, it will not be enough to 'past the test' on anti-Semitism.""
Canadians should not view all these controversies and scandals as foreign to us. Jews were this country's most targeted minority for hate crimes in 2018, according to data released in February by Statistics Canada, despite their small population. And a breakdown of hate-crime incidents revealed last month by Toronto police found 44 out of 139 hate-related incidents in 2019 targeted the Jewish community - 32 per cent of all hate crimes.
Earlier this year, a Zoom prayer service at Shaarei Shomayin synagogue was hijacked by trolls, screaming, ""Gas chambers!"" and ""Hitler was right!""
Pandemic or pogroms, there's never been a time when Jew-hatred has not thrived.

(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)
Good morning.
We’re covering Europe’s reopening to travelers (but not Americans), China’s sweeping security law for Hong Kong and why Russian internet stars are keeping their distance from Putin.
Europe reopens, but not for U.S., Russia or Brazil
The European Union will open its borders to visitors from 15 countries as of today. Those countries do not include the U.S., Brazil or Russia, where coronavirus caseloads continue to balloon.
The list of approved nations includes Australia, Canada and New Zealand; travelers from China will also be allowed in, if China reciprocates. E.U. countries are desperate to restart tourism while preventing new outbreaks.
The decision came as more than 47,000 cases were reported in the U.S. on Tuesday. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country’s top infectious disease expert, said the number of new infections could reach 100,000 a day if the surges in many states were not contained.
What it means: E.U. officials tried to appear apolitical in their choices, but leaving the U.S. off the list was a high-profile rebuke of the Trump administration’s handling of the crisis.
Here are the latest updates and maps of where the virus has spread.

What we know about the Hong Kong security law
China adopted a national security law for Hong Kong on Tuesday that gives the central authorities sweeping powers to crack down on dissent in the city.
The legislation, which had not previously been seen by the public and took effect immediately, provides a blueprint for the authorities and courts to suppress the protest movement that has roiled the city for a year, and for China’s national security apparatus to pervade Hong Kong society.
In ambiguous wording, it lays out new crimes that carry maximum penalties of life imprisonment. Here are some key points:
Activities like damaging government buildings and interrupting public transit are described as acts of subversion and terrorism — a measure directly aimed at antigovernment protesters.
The law allows Beijing to seize broad control in security cases, especially during crises. Suspects in cases could be sent to face trial in mainland China, where the opaque judicial system is controlled by the Communist Party. 
Focusing heavily on the perceived role of foreigners in Hong Kong’s unrest, the law will impose harsh penalties on anyone who urges foreign countries to criticize or to impose sanctions on the government.What it means: At least two groups that have called for Hong Kong to become an independent state said they would stop operating in the city. Activists are also worried that the law will be used against people who peacefully call for autonomy rather than independence.
Police insist killing of a Black man in Denmark was not racist
A young Black man was tortured and killed on a remote island in Denmark by two white men with known far-right affiliations, the police say. But the authorities are refusing to call it a hate crime and are denying that race was a factor.
The man, Phillip Mbuji Johansen, a 28-year-old engineering student of Danish and Tanzanian descent, had gone to a party on Monday and was later invited for a beer in the woods, his mother told a local newspaper. His mutilated body was found at a camp site the next morning.
Two suspects, brothers who have not yet been publicly identified, were arrested on Wednesday on manslaughter charges. One of them has a swastika and the words “white power” tattooed on his leg. The other has expressed support for a Danish extreme right party called Stram Kurs, or Hard Line.
Context: Between 2007 and 2016, racially motivated hate crimes in Denmark more than quadrupled, according to one report. Local activists say the country has a pattern of denial in racially motivated crimes, in some cases because of anti-immigrant attitudes.
Related: King Philippe of Belgium has expressed his “deepest regrets” for his country’s brutal past in a letter to the president of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the first public acknowledgment from a member of the Belgian royal family of the devastating toll of eight decades of colonization.
Adidas: A top executive resigned on Tuesday after a number of Black employees pushed for her ouster and said the company fostered a racist and discriminatory workplace.
If you have 10 minutes, this is worth it
Russia’s internet stars turn away from Putin
Young Russians — who used to be among President Vladimir Putin’s most avid supporters — have swung hard the other way. 
Mr. Putin seems assured of victory today in a referendum that would allow him to amend the Constitution and stay in power until 2036. But he has lost his pop culture cachet, and online celebrities are now reluctant to be associated with the Kremlin. “The public mood has really changed,” one Russian blogger said.
Here’s what else is happening
Swine flu: A study warns that a new strain of the H1N1 virus, common on pig farms in China since 2016, should be “urgently” controlled to avoid another pandemic.
Russian bounties: American officials have intercepted data showing financial transfers from a bank account controlled by Russia’s military intelligence agency to a Taliban-linked account — evidence supporting their conclusion that Russia offered bounties for killing U.S. and coalition troops in Afghanistan.
Huawei and ZTE: The U.S. Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday designated the Chinese telecommunications firms as national security threats, cutting them off from billions of dollars in federal broadband subsidies.
Syria aid summit: Donors pledged $7.7 billion in aid Tuesday to support Syria’s collapsing economy as the civil war enters its 10th year during a pandemic. 
Snapshot: Above, the East Anglia One wind turbine project off Britain’s east coast. The pandemic’s fallout may have rocked the oil and gas industry, but producers of clean energy have charged ahead, complete with measures to protect workers from the virus as they fix turbines.

Now, a break from the news
Cook: Sichuan chile crisp with peanut streusel doesn’t sound like it should work, but it does — especially when paired with a sundae. You can also omit the peanut streusel or replace it with crushed peanuts. 
Watch: Cinéma vérité raises fascinating questions about the genre’s capacity to accurately mirror the world. Our reviewer recommends “Crisis” and “Salesman” if you want to become acquainted with a style that tests the boundaries of nonfiction filmmaking.
Do: Bridal boutiques are offering virtual shopping experiences where brides, grooms and members of their wedding parties can try on and buy their attire online. Here are a few options for shopping without having to leave home.

And now for the Back Story on …
Black with a capital B
The Times announced on Tuesday that it would start using uppercase “Black” to describe people and cultures of African origin, both in the U.S. and elsewhere. Here is what our National editor, Marc Lacey, wrote about the change.
My father was born a Negro. Then he was black. Late in life, much to his discomfort, he became an African-American.
Everyone in this country who traces their ancestors back to Africa has experienced a panoply of racial identifiers over their lives, with some terms imposed and others embraced. In the course of a single day in 2020, I might be called black, African-American or a person of color. I’m also labeled, in a way that makes my brown skin crawl, as diverse, ethnic or a minority.
Amid the nation’s reckoning with racism following the death of George Floyd, another name is being widely adopted: Black with a capital B.
John Eligon, a New York Times national correspondent who writes about race, captures the discussion in an article. As he notes, each name change brings spirited discussion. Isn’t black a color, not a race? If one capitalizes Black, should one also capitalize White? And Brown?
As one who works in words, I would never suggest that word choice does not matter. Words can affect the thinking of both those who write them and those who read them. So I am in favor of pushing the shift key — but I doubt it will be the last time we edit what people like me are called.

 BOSTON — Police officers in Massachusetts would have to be certified by the state under a bill filed Wednesday by Gov. Charlie Baker.
The bill would also allow for the decertification of officers who engage in excessive force, and it encourages additional training, including for advanced deescalation techniques.
Massachusetts is one of only a few states without a statewide certification program for law enforcement.
The Republican governor said his administration worked with members of the Massachusetts Black and Latino Legislative Caucus and public safety officials to draft the bill.
Baker said at a press conference that the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis at the hands of police officers made it clear it's ""the time to get this done.” He added that improving law enforcement is only one piece of the process.

LONDON — The governing body of Oxford University’s Oriel College has recommended the removal of a statue of Victorian imperialist Cecil Rhodes that has long been the target of protests.
The college’s governors, made up of faculty, met Wednesday and said they had “voted to launch an independent Commission of Inquiry into the key issues surrounding the Rhodes statue.“
A similar campaign has sought the removal of his statue in Oxford. The movement has gained new momentum since the death of George Floyd spurred anti-racism protests around the world.
Rhodes made a fortune from gold and diamond mines in the late 19th century, with miners laboring in brutal conditions. His statue was removed from the University of Cape Town in South Africa in 2015.

RICHMOND, Va. — A statue of African American tennis star Arthur Ashe has been vandalized.
Photos show the base of the monument tagged with white spray paint and the words “white lives matter” as well as the initials “WLM.” Those initials were later painted over with “BLM,” short for black lives matter.
Richmond Police said they were alerted to the vandalism on Monument Avenue about 10:15 a.m. Wednesday. Police say red paint on the statue itself was already being removed by community members.
Authorities have information on possible suspects and are asking the community to call the Crime Stoppers line if they have information on who was responsible for the vandalism.
The monument was dedicated in 1996 to memorialize the Richmond native, who died in 1993, and to counterbalance the string of statues on Memorial Avenue dedicated to Confederate leaders.

LAS VEGAS — The University of Nevada, Las Vegas has removed a statue of its “Hey Reb!” mascot from in front of its alumni center following an outcry from student groups, including the Native American Student Association.
The decision to remove the bronze statue, which was criticized for its relationship to the Confederacy, came weeks after the death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis.
University President Marta Meana says she has had conversations with individuals and stakeholders about how the university can move forward in light of recent events.
The statue is expected to be returned to its donors.

NEW YORK — New York’s governor signed an executive order recognizing Juneteenth as a paid holiday for state employees to commemorate the emancipation of slaves in the U.S.

AMSTERDAM — Vandals have daubed red paint and the word “racist” on a statue of Mohandas Gandhi in Amsterdam, amid a wave of attacks on statues around the world of controversial historical figures.
A worker cleaned the statue Wednesday with a high-pressure water hose. Gandhi, widely lauded for his peaceful campaign to win independence for India, has faced criticism for some of his writings about black Africans.
A lawyer, Gandhi traveled to South Africa in 1893 and stayed for two decades, fighting to expand rights for Indians there. He has faced criticism for referring in his writings to black South Africans as backward. However, he later changed his views and supported the rights of black South Africans.
His nonviolent resistance methods have been used in movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.

DETROIT — A white suburban Detroit police chief has been suspended for 30 days without pay and will undergo diversity training for inappropriate social media posts about people protesting the death of George Floyd.
Trustees in Macomb County’s Shelby Township voted 5-2 on Tuesday night on the punishment for chief Robert J. Shelide, who has held the title since 2015.
Shelide, who earlier apologized, told the township board before the vote that he is “not a racist” and “I bleed blue.”
Shelide had been on administrative leave the past two weeks while officials investigated posts on a now-deleted Twitter account. Screenshots posted on Facebook show one tweet spoke about the need to “unleash real cops” and describing protesters as “barbarians” and needing “body bags.“

PORTLAND, Ore. — Police say a man drove his car into a crowd of protesters early Wednesday in downtown Portland, injuring three people.
Police say the 27-year-old male driver drove away “at a high rate of speed,” but was tracked and arrested on suspicion of hit and run, reckless driving and possession of a controlled substance, according to The Oregonian/OregonLive.
Two people were taken by ambulance to a hospital. Another was taken for treatment in a personal car. Police say none of the injuries were life-threatening.

ATLANTA — Georgia’s lieutenant governor is proposing a version of a hate crimes law for the state.
Republican Geoff Duncan called on lawmakers to create a free-standing hate crime and include more categories of bias crimes. Those would involve people victimized because of their culture and their status in exercising First Amendment rights, including worship, free speech, free press, assembly or petition of government.
A previous effort was found unconstitutional by the state Supreme Court more than a decade ago.
In February, Ahmaud Arbery was shot near Brunswick, Georgia. Investigators have said a white man uttered a racial slur after chasing Arbery down and shooting him.
Georgia’s House passed a simpler measure last year that’s been stalled in a Senate committee for more than year. The bill would add extra penalties onto crimes committed because of someone’s race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, mental disability or physical disability.

GENEVA — The brother of George Floyd has made a heartfelt plea to the U.N.’s top human rights body to launch intense international scrutiny of systemic racism and the killing of unarmed blacks by police.
Philonese Floyd’s message by video to the Human Rights Council came as it contemplates an unprecedented bid sought by the Africa Group to create a Commission of Inquiry — the council’s most powerful tool of scrutiny — to examine and report on racism and violence against protesters by police in the United States.
“I am my brother’s keeper. You in the United Nations are your brothers and sisters’ keepers in America — and you have the power to help us get justice for my brother George Floyd,” Floyd said. “I am asking you to help him. I am asking you to help me. I am asking you to help us: Black people in America.”

HUNTINGTON, W.Va. — The Huntington City Council in West Virginia will vote Wednesday on a proposal to make Juneteenth a permanent city holiday.
The celebration commemorates when enslaved people in Texas learned they were free on June 19, 1865. Huntington Mayor Steve Williams told The Herald-Dispatch he supports the proposal and wants the city’s African American residents to know “the city celebrates Juneteenth with them just as we all celebrate July Fourth together.”
The mayor says the idea for the holiday proposal came from meetings with his diversity advisory committee amid the international protests following the death of George Floyd. Williams expects Wednesday’s meeting will help fast-track the resolution so council members can get it in the books before Friday.
The Emancipation Proclamation was signed by President Abraham Lincoln on Jan. 1, 1863, and freed enslaved people of the rebellion Confederate states.

HOUSTON — Officials say a statue of a Confederate soldier has been removed from a downtown Houston park and a second Confederate statue is expected to be removed soon.
The “Spirit of the Confederacy” statue was removed late Tuesday from Sam Houston Park. Mayor Sylvester Turner said last week the statue will be housed in the Houston Museum of African American Culture.
A second statue, of Confederate artillery commander Richard W. “Dick” Dowling, is also slated for removal. Initially, the Dowling statue was to be moved from Houston’s Hermann Park to the Sabine Pass Battleground State Historical Site near Port Arthur.
But officials say the Dowling statue will instead be placed in a warehouse, at least temporarily, after leaders in Port Arthur expressed opposition.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — A Roman Catholic chaplain at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has resigned at the request of the archdiocese after sending an email suggesting the killing of George Floyd was not an act of racism and he hadn’t lived “a virtuous life.”
The Archdiocese of Boston asked the Rev. Daniel Patrick Moloney to step down June 9 after he sent the message to Catholics at MIT, The Boston Globe reports. A statement from the archdiocese said Moloney’s comments “were wrong and by his resignation he accepts the hurt they have caused.”
The archdiocese learned about the email from Catholics at MIT and alumni. Moloney says he was trying to speak out against “cancel culture” and regrets his message has been misunderstood.
Suzy Nelson, an MIT vice president and dean for student life, sent an email to students calling Moloney’s comments “deeply disturbing” and “Father Moloney’s message failed to acknowledge the dignity of each human being and the devastating impact of systemic racism.”

GENEVA – A U.S. ambassador says the United States is committed to addressing its “shortcomings,” ahead of the U.N. human rights body's discussion of systemic racism and police brutality.
Andrew Bremberg, the U.S. ambassador in Geneva, noted President Donald Trump has condemned the actions of Minneapolis police officers involved in the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man. Trump signed an executive order on police reform on Tuesday.
“The United States recognizes and is committed to addressing its shortcomings, including racial discrimination, and injustices that stem from such discrimination, that persist in our society,” Bremberg said in a statement. “Every democracy faces challenges — the difference is how we deal with them.”
Bremberg says the executive order was “an example of how transparent and responsive our government leaders are in holding violators accountable for their actions and reforming our own system.”
The Human Rights Council in Geneva, following a call by African nations, will discuss “racially inspired human rights violations, systematic racism, police brutality and the violence against peaceful protests.”

NEW ORLEANS — The whereabouts of a statue of a slave owner toppled by protesters in New Orleans and thrown into the Mississippi River remain unknown after a group of men fished the bust out of the water.
A video shows the group using ropes and a plank to carry the paint-splattered bust of John McDonogh out of the river and onto a pickup truck Sunday.
Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s office told The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate the bust is “considered stolen property,” and whoever has it should contact the city regarding its return.
McDonogh left much of his money to New Orleans and Baltimore for schools, and many schools in New Orleans are named after him.
On McDonogh Day each year, schoolchildren from across the city lined up to lay flowers in a racially segregated ceremony. It was boycotted in the 1950s when African-American children would have to wait for hours for white children to lay their flowers first.

One victim, James Chaney, was Black and a local resident. The other two were white Jews from New York City, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner.
The Freedom Summer Murders they were called, in a U.S.A. a-roil with protests and demonstrations, rather like now. The young men were working to register African-Americans to vote.
It is often forgotten now how deeply entwined American Jews were with the civil rights movement and the struggle to obtain equal rights for Blacks under the law.
""Is Labour Anti-Semitic?"" was the name of an investigative Panorama documentary that aired on the BBC a year ago which probed allegations made by seven whistleblowers about widespread anti-Semitism within the Labour Party during the years it was led by Jeremy Corbyn.
A party founded in part a century ago by the Jewish Labour Movement, then known as Poale Zion, in the United Kingdom. Working-class Jews at the time flocked to Labour as the party which reflected the hopes and aspirations of a largely impoverished migrant community but also for Labour's deep and defining commitment to a Jewish state.
It is often forgotten now how deeply entwined British Jews have been with the very essence of the Labour Party. A party that, in the Corbyn era, was plagued by accusations of anti-Semitism masquerading as anti-Zionism, expressed in virulence towards Israel, the nation that Labour had once proudly extolled.
Apologies for anti-Semitism are in the wind.
From Labour's new leader Keir Starmer, who three weeks ago sacked a front bench MP, shadow education secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey, for sharing a Jewish conspiracy theory that the knee-on-neck restraint which killed George Floyd had been taught to American law enforcement by the Israeli Defense Forces.
To TV host and producer Nick Cannon, with a lengthy if lame Facebook post following a podcast with controversial hip-hop figure Richard ""Professor Griff"" Griffin, in which Cannon amplified Griff's views that Jewish people controlled the music industry and the media, likening it to the power of the Rothschild banking family. Really, nothing more than a modern version of the Protocols of Zion, a 19th-century hoax purporting to be the confidential minutes of a Jewish conclave plotting to take over the world.
Cannon said approvingly that Griff was ""speaking facts,"" praised Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan and his ideology, and insisted Black people are the ""true Hebrews.""
""It's never hate speech,"" he said. ""You can't be anti-Semitic when we are the Semitic people, when we are the same people who they want to be. That's our birthright. We are the true Hebrews.""
Somebody give Cannon a copy of ""Anti-Semitism for Dummies.""
The comedian, actor and former host of ""America's Got Talent"" - a one-man entertainment dynamo - was axed by ViacomCBS last week amidst an angry backlash, after which he tweeted: ""I hurt an entire community and it pained me to my core. I thought it couldn't get any worse. Then I watched my own community turn on me and call me a sellout for apologizing. Goodnight. Enjoy Earth.''
Because some in the Black community bravely took Cannon to task. It can't be easy, especially in these tumultuous times of global protest over policy brutality, racial inequality and Black Lives Matter fighting for the dignity of a people, to assail a Black individual who has achieved mass cultural fame.
ViacomCBS, which also owns MTV, where Cannon's celebrity sketch series ""Wild 'N Out"" has been a fixture since 2005, issued a statement saying the company ""condemns bigotry of any kind and we categorically denounce all forms of anti-Semitism.
""We have spoken with Nick Cannon about an episode of the podcast ""Cannon's Class"" on YouTube, which promoted hateful speech and spread anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. While we support ongoing education and dialogue in the fight against bigotry, we are deeply troubled that Nick has failed to acknowledge or apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism, and we are terminating our relationship with him.""
Cannon tried again with the forelock-tugging, even while charging ViacomCBS with being ""on the wrong side of history.""
""I don't blame any individual. I blame the oppressive and racist infrastructure,"" he said on Facebook. ""System racism is what the world was built on and was the subject in which I was attempting to highlight in the recent clips that have been circulating from my podcast. If I have furthered the hate speech, I wholeheartedly apologize.""
Then he got his sorry around to the Jews. ""I must apologize to my Jewish Brothers and Sister for putting them in such a painful position, which was never my intention, but I know this whole situation has hurt many people and together we will make it right.""
Rabbis and others in the Jewish community have, with admirable generosity of spirit, been ""educating"" Cannon on history. Perhaps they told him about Rabbi Joachim Prinz, who's involvement with the civil rights movement in the 1960s culminated in his ""Silence"" address at the 1963 March on Washington, delivered just before Martin Luther King gave his ""I Have a Dream"" speech.
Cannon is not a stupid man. That's what made his ignorance so profound. And there was nothing ""inadvertent"" about it.
He is just, however, one pathetic fool.
How to explain an entire political party going anti-Semitically off the rails, as happened to Labour with Corbyn at the helm?
Under his leadership, radically left membership pulled Labour towards increasingly venomous criticism of Israel, which is entirely legitimate as long as it doesn't indulge in hatred toward a people rather than a government or indulge in anti-Semitic tropes. Such as former London mayor Ken Livingston claiming during several interviews that Adolf Hitler supported Zionism. Anti-Semitic incidents just kept piling up and many Jews no longer felt comfortable under the Labour umbrella.
Labour became so embroiled in accusations of anti-Semitism that prominent human rights activist Shami Chakrabarti was asked to investigate claims of widespread anti-Semitism within the party. She exonerated Labour but uncovered an ""occasionally toxic atmosphere."" Many viewed her report as a whitewash. (Chakrabarti was given a peerage by Labour mere months after it was published.)
Last year saw a number of high-profile resignations of MPs and peers over anti-Semitism, including the Jewish MP Luciana Berger. The Equality and Human Rights Commission placed the party under formal investigation over whether it had unlawfully discriminated against, harassed or victimized people because they were Jewish. (The findings have yet to be released.)
There was an endless row over whether the party should adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance of anti-Semitism, which it ended up ultimately approving.
Then the whistleblowers spoke to Panorama, saying they felt there was political meddling from Corby's office in the process for handling anti-Semitism complaints - of which there were hundreds and hundreds.
The Guardian reported last week that Labour is poised to formally apologize to the whistleblowers, who afterwards sued the party for defamation - they'd claimed senior party officials had issued statements attacking their reputations and that their intent was to undermine the party - as part of a settlement to put their crisis behind them.
In last December's general election, Corbyn led Labour to its worst result in nearly a century.
Immediately after Starmer replaced Corby as leader in April, he held a video conference promising to set up an independent complaints process and outlining steps to stamp out anti-Semitism within Labour.
""It was very important to me to seek to address the disgrace of anti-Semitism in our party,"" he said.
""Over the last few years, we have failed the Jewish community on anti-Semitism. Labour is a proudly anti-racist party and, going forward, it will not be enough to 'past the test' on anti-Semitism.""
Canadians should not view all these controversies and scandals as foreign to us. Jews were this country's most targeted minority for hate crimes in 2018, according to data released in February by Statistics Canada, despite their small population. And a breakdown of hate-crime incidents revealed last month by Toronto police found 44 out of 139 hate-related incidents in 2019 targeted the Jewish community - 32 per cent of all hate crimes.
Earlier this year, a Zoom prayer service at Shaarei Shomayin synagogue was hijacked by trolls, screaming, ""Gas chambers!"" and ""Hitler was right!""
Pandemic or pogroms, there's never been a time when Jew-hatred has not thrived.

RICHMOND, Va. — A statue of African American tennis star Arthur Ashe has been vandalized.

Richmond Police said they were alerted to the vandalism on Monument Avenue about 10:15 a.m. Wednesday. Police say red paint on the statue itself was already being removed by community members.
Authorities have information on possible suspects and are asking the community to call the Crime Stoppers line if they have information on who was responsible for the vandalism.
The monument was dedicated in 1996 to memorialize the Richmond native, who died in 1993, and to counterbalance the string of statues on Memorial Avenue dedicated to Confederate leaders.

ATLANTA — Georgia’s lieutenant governor is proposing a version of a hate crimes law for the state.
Republican Geoff Duncan called on lawmakers to create a free-standing hate crime and include more categories of bias crimes. Those would involve people victimized because of their culture and their status in exercising First Amendment rights, including worship, free speech, free press, assembly or petition of government.
A previous effort was found unconstitutional by the state Supreme Court more than a decade ago.
In February, Ahmaud Arbery was shot near Brunswick, Georgia. Investigators have said a white man uttered a racial slur after chasing Arbery down and shooting him.
Georgia’s House passed a simpler measure last year that’s been stalled in a Senate committee for more than year. The bill would add extra penalties onto crimes committed because of someone’s race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, mental disability or physical disability.

GENEVA — The brother of George Floyd has made a heartfelt plea to the U.N.’s top human rights body to launch intense international scrutiny of systemic racism and the killing of unarmed blacks by police.
Philonese Floyd’s message by video to the Human Rights Council came as it contemplates an unprecedented bid sought by the Africa Group to create a Commission of Inquiry — the council’s most powerful tool of scrutiny — to examine and report on racism and violence against protesters by police in the United States.
“I am my brother’s keeper. You in the United Nations are your brothers and sisters’ keepers in America — and you have the power to help us get justice for my brother George Floyd,” Floyd said. “I am asking you to help him. I am asking you to help me. I am asking you to help us: Black people in America.”

HUNTINGTON, W.Va. — The Huntington City Council in West Virginia will vote Wednesday on a proposal to make Juneteenth a permanent city holiday.
The celebration commemorates when enslaved people in Texas learned they were free on June 19, 1865. Huntington Mayor Steve Williams told The Herald-Dispatch he supports the proposal and wants the city’s African American residents to know “the city celebrates Juneteenth with them just as we all celebrate July Fourth together.”
The mayor says the idea for the holiday proposal came from meetings with his diversity advisory committee amid the international protests following the death of George Floyd. Williams expects Wednesday’s meeting will help fast-track the resolution so council members can get it in the books before Friday.
The Emancipation Proclamation was signed by President Abraham Lincoln on Jan. 1, 1863, and freed enslaved people of the rebellion Confederate states.

HOUSTON — Officials say a statue of a Confederate soldier has been removed from a downtown Houston park and a second Confederate statue is expected to be removed soon.
The “Spirit of the Confederacy” statue was removed late Tuesday from Sam Houston Park. Mayor Sylvester Turner said last week the statue will be housed in the Houston Museum of African American Culture.
A second statue, of Confederate artillery commander Richard W. “Dick” Dowling, is also slated for removal. Initially, the Dowling statue was to be moved from Houston’s Hermann Park to the Sabine Pass Battleground State Historical Site near Port Arthur.
But officials say the Dowling statue will instead be placed in a warehouse, at least temporarily, after leaders in Port Arthur expressed opposition.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — A Roman Catholic chaplain at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has resigned at the request of the archdiocese after sending an email suggesting the killing of George Floyd was not an act of racism and he hadn’t lived “a virtuous life.”
The Archdiocese of Boston asked the Rev. Daniel Patrick Moloney to step down June 9 after he sent the message to Catholics at MIT, The Boston Globe reports. A statement from the archdiocese said Moloney’s comments “were wrong and by his resignation he accepts the hurt they have caused.”
The archdiocese learned about the email from Catholics at MIT and alumni. Moloney says he was trying to speak out against “cancel culture” and regrets his message has been misunderstood.
Suzy Nelson, an MIT vice president and dean for student life, sent an email to students calling Moloney’s comments “deeply disturbing” and “Father Moloney’s message failed to acknowledge the dignity of each human being and the devastating impact of systemic racism.”

GENEVA – A U.S. ambassador says the United States is committed to addressing its “shortcomings,” ahead of the U.N. human rights body's discussion of systemic racism and police brutality.
Andrew Bremberg, the U.S. ambassador in Geneva, noted President Donald Trump has condemned the actions of Minneapolis police officers involved in the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man. Trump signed an executive order on police reform on Tuesday.
“The United States recognizes and is committed to addressing its shortcomings, including racial discrimination, and injustices that stem from such discrimination, that persist in our society,” Bremberg said in a statement. “Every democracy faces challenges — the difference is how we deal with them.”
Bremberg says the executive order was “an example of how transparent and responsive our government leaders are in holding violators accountable for their actions and reforming our own system.”
The Human Rights Council in Geneva, following a call by African nations, will discuss “racially inspired human rights violations, systematic racism, police brutality and the violence against peaceful protests.”

NEW ORLEANS — The whereabouts of a statue of a slave owner toppled by protesters in New Orleans and thrown into the Mississippi River remain unknown after a group of men fished the bust out of the water.
A video shows the group using ropes and a plank to carry the paint-splattered bust of John McDonogh out of the river and onto a pickup truck Sunday.
Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s office told The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate the bust is “considered stolen property,” and whoever has it should contact the city regarding its return.
McDonogh left much of his money to New Orleans and Baltimore for schools, and many schools in New Orleans are named after him.
On McDonogh Day each year, schoolchildren from across the city lined up to lay flowers in a racially segregated ceremony. It was boycotted in the 1950s when African-American children would have to wait for hours for white children to lay their flowers first.

RICHMOND, Va. — Demonstrators in Richmond tore down another Confederate statue on Tuesday night.
The Howitzers Monument located near Virginia Commonwealth University’s Monroe Park campus was toppled after protesters spent the night marching in the rain and used a rope to pull it down from its pedestal.
A video from the Richmond Times-Dispatch shows the paint-splattered statue on the ground as the rain continued overnight in Virginia’s capital city.
It’s the third Confederate statue, and the fourth monument, to be torn down in Virginia since international protests erupted following the death of George Floyd by a white Minneapolis police officer who pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck.
Statues of Confederate president Jefferson Davis, Confederate Gen. Williams Carter Wickham as well as Christopher Columbus were toppled.
The protesters in Richmond started their march Tuesday night advocating for the removal of all Confederate statues, establishing a civilian policing review board and defunding the police, among other things.
The Howitzers Monument, showed a Confederate artilleryman standing in front of a gun, was erected in 1892 to memorialize the city’s Civil War artillery unit, according to the Encyclopedia of Virginia.

PORTLAND, Ore. — At least two Portland-based reporters have been hurt in recent days while covering protests against police brutality.
Oregon Public Broadcasting reports Oregonian journalist Beth Nakamura recounted being slammed by a baton. Portland Tribune reporter Zane Sparling said he was shoved into a wall by a police officer and hit by a crowd control munition.
The reporters say they identified themselves to police as press. In both incidents, the reporters were told by police, in what the journalists described as profanity-laced responses, that their press credentials did not matter.
Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler said on Twitter they were alarming incidents that need to be addressed.
Police spokesperson Lt. Tina Jones says they continue to work with media partners about the importance of following lawful orders so they can stay safe and avoid arrest or altercation.
However, members of the media have a fundamental right to do their jobs during demonstrations.

Human rights groups say many of the detentions are based on scant evidence.
NEW DELHI -- After spending several anxious days in prison, Natasha Narwal, a student activist accused of rioting by the New Delhi police, thought her ordeal was nearing an end. 
 A judge ruled that Ms. Narwal had been exercising her democratic rights when she participated in protests earlier this year against a divisive citizenship law that incited unrest across India.
 But shortly after the judge approved Ms. Narwal's release in late May, the police announced fresh charges: murder, terrorism and organizing protests that instigated deadly religious violence in India's capital. Ms. Narwal, 32, who has said that she is innocent, was returned to her cell.
 ''I felt like crying,'' said her roommate, Vikramaditya Sahai. ''We are grieving the country we grew up in.''
 As India struggles to quell surging coronavirus infections, lawyers accuse the authorities of seizing on the pandemic as an opportunity to round up critics of the government who are protesting what they see as iron-fisted and anti-minority policies under Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
 In recent weeks, Ms. Narwal and nearly a dozen other prominent activists -- along with potentially dozens of other demonstrators, though police records are unclear -- have been detained. They are being held under stringent sedition and antiterrorism laws that have been used to criminalize everything from leading rallies to posting political messages on social media.
 India's coronavirus restrictions, some of which are still in effect, have blocked pathways to justice, lawyers and rights activists say. With courts closed for weeks, lawyers have struggled to file bail applications, and meeting privately with prisoners has been nearly impossible.
 Law enforcement officials in New Delhi, who are under the direct control of India's home ministry, have denied any impropriety. But rights groups say the arrests have been arbitrary, based on scant evidence and in line with a broader deterioration of free speech in India.
 In a lengthy report released this month, the Delhi Minorities Commission, a government body, accused the police and politicians from Mr. Modi's party of inciting brutal attacks on protesters and supporting a ''pogrom'' against minority Muslims.
 Meenakshi Ganguly, the South Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said cases against the activists appeared to be ''politically motivated,'' and that the police have devised a formula for keeping people like Ms. Narwal in jail: When a judge orders the release of a prisoner for lack of evidence, new charges are introduced.
 ''The urgency to arrest rights activists and an obvious reluctance to act against violent actions of the government's supporters show a complete breakdown in the rule of law,'' she said.
 Before the pandemic hit, Mr. Modi was in the throes of the most significant challenge to his power since becoming prime minister in 2014. After Parliament passed a law last year that made it easier for non-Muslim migrants to become Indian citizens, millions protested across the country.
 To critics, the citizenship law was more evidence that Mr. Modi's Hindu nationalist government planned to strip the country's Muslims of their rights.
 Tensions peaked in February when sectarian violence and rioting broke out in New Delhi. The vast majority of people killed, hurt or displaced were Muslim, and the police were involved in many of those cases.
 After Mr. Modi announced a nationwide lockdown in late March to contain the coronavirus, shutting down businesses and ordering all 1.3 billion Indians inside, the protests disbanded. Lawyers said the police then moved to detain demonstrators while skirting complaints against government allies.
 Among those in custody are a youth activist who raised awareness about police brutality against Muslims; an academic who gave a speech opposing the citizenship law; and Ms. Narwal, a graduate student who co-founded Pinjra Tod, or Break the Cage, a women's collective that organized some of the largest rallies.
 Nitika Khaitan, a criminal lawyer, said the crackdown has also pushed beyond higher-profile critics to include ordinary residents living in riot-hit neighborhoods. She recently challenged those arrests in a jointly signed letter to the Delhi High Court.
 Lawyers have tracked a few dozen such arrests under the lockdown, though Ms. Khaitan said the true figure could not be verified because police reports have not been made public. Many detentions were ''not in compliance with constitutional mandates,'' she said.
 In a recent interview, Sachidanand Shrivastava, the police chief in New Delhi, said his officers were conducting fair investigations.
 In May, the authorities said they had detained about 1,300 people for involvement in the protests and riots, including an equal number of Hindus and Muslims. Recently, the police arrested a group of Hindus for forcing nine Muslim men to chant ''Hail Lord Ram,'' a reference to a Hindu god, before killing them and throwing their bodies into a drain.
 ''It is very important that the police force remain impartial,'' Mr. Shrivastava said. ''And we are following this principle from Day 1.''
 But members of India's judiciary have questioned the official numbers, accusing the police of withholding information about the arrests under national security protections and singling out Muslims for many of the harsher charges.
 In court proceeding notes reviewed by The Times, a judge hearing a case against a Muslim protester wrote that the police appeared to only be targeting ''one end'' without probing the ''rival faction.'' During the riots, the police were accused of abetting Hindus and, in some cases, torturing Muslims.
 Khalid Saifi, a member of United Against Hate, a group that works with victims of hate crimes, was arrested after he tried to mediate between the police and protesters, according to his lawyers.
 The police charged him with being a ''key conspirator'' of the riots. His wife, Nargis Saifi, said he was tortured in custody.
 ''His only crime is he is a Muslim,'' she said.
 M.S. Randhawa, a police spokesman, denied that Mr. Saifi had been tortured, adding that he has regular opportunities to speak to a judge if abuse occurs.
 ''These are just allegations,'' Mr. Randhawa said. ''He would have told the magistrate if he had been tortured.''
 But rights advocates accuse Mr. Modi's government of shielding party officials -- and more broadly, of Hindus involved in the violence.
 Ms. Narwal, who was detained in May, could face at least several years in prison for helping organize demonstrations that blocked a busy road in northeast Delhi, where February's bloodiest battles between Hindus and Muslims broke out.
 The police have accused her of playing a leading role in the riots, charging her with murder, attempt to murder and being part of a ''criminal conspiracy.''
 At the same time, the police have been accused of ignoring complaints against Kapil Mishra, a local politician with Mr. Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party who gave a fiery speech threatening to forcibly remove Ms. Narwal and other protesters if the authorities did not take action.
 Hours after the ultimatum, the streets erupted. But charges were never filed against Mr. Mishra, who has denied a role in starting the riots.
 A New Delhi police superintendent, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said some officers had wanted to act against Mr. Mishra, but they were pressured by the force's leadership not to touch ''the warriors of the government.''
 ''We did not even try,'' the superintendent said. ''The directions were clear: Don't lay your hands on him.''
 Through an intermediary, Mr. Mishra declined to comment.
 Ms. Narwal's father, Mahavir Narwal, said the government was moving India closer to authoritarianism and demonizing anybody who questioned their policies.
 For weeks, prison officials ignored his calls and emails to Tihar Jail, where Ms. Narwal is being held. With coronavirus restrictions in place, she was moved into an isolation ward at one point, where she stayed for 17 days, said Mr. Narwal, a retired scientist.
 Lately, communication has smoothed out. But Mr. Narwal said the subtext of his daughter's arrest seemed clear: ''If you protest, you will be called a terrorist.''
 ''All she did was fight to keep the soul of India alive,'' he said.

GENEVA — The brother of George Floyd has made a heartfelt plea to the U.N.’s top human rights body to launch intense international scrutiny of systemic racism and the killing of unarmed blacks by police.
Philonese Floyd’s message by video to the Human Rights Council came as it contemplates an unprecedented bid sought by the Africa Group to create a Commission of Inquiry — the council’s most powerful tool of scrutiny — to examine and report on racism and violence against protesters by police in the United States.
“I am my brother’s keeper. You in the United Nations are your brothers and sisters’ keepers in America — and you have the power to help us get justice for my brother George Floyd,” Floyd said. “I am asking you to help him. I am asking you to help me. I am asking you to help us: Black people in America.”

HUNTINGTON, W.Va. — The Huntington City Council in West Virginia will vote Wednesday on a proposal to make Juneteenth a permanent city holiday.
The celebration commemorates when enslaved people in Texas learned they were free on June 19, 1865. Huntington Mayor Steve Williams told The Herald-Dispatch he supports the proposal and wants the city’s African American residents to know “the city celebrates Juneteenth with them just as we all celebrate July Fourth together.”
The mayor says the idea for the holiday proposal came from meetings with his diversity advisory committee amid the international protests following the death of George Floyd. Williams expects Wednesday’s meeting will help fast-track the resolution so council members can get it in the books before Friday.
The Emancipation Proclamation was signed by President Abraham Lincoln on Jan. 1, 1863, and freed enslaved people of the rebellion Confederate states.

HOUSTON — Officials say a statue of a Confederate soldier has been removed from a downtown Houston park and a second Confederate statue is expected to be removed soon.
The “Spirit of the Confederacy” statue was removed late Tuesday from Sam Houston Park. Mayor Sylvester Turner said last week the statue will be housed in the Houston Museum of African American Culture.
A second statue, of Confederate artillery commander Richard W. “Dick” Dowling, is also slated for removal. Initially, the Dowling statue was to be moved from Houston’s Hermann Park to the Sabine Pass Battleground State Historical Site near Port Arthur.
But officials say the Dowling statue will instead be placed in a warehouse, at least temporarily, after leaders in Port Arthur expressed opposition.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — A Roman Catholic chaplain at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has resigned at the request of the archdiocese after sending an email suggesting the killing of George Floyd was not an act of racism and he hadn’t lived “a virtuous life.”
The Archdiocese of Boston asked the Rev. Daniel Patrick Moloney to step down June 9 after he sent the message to Catholics at MIT, The Boston Globe reports. A statement from the archdiocese said Moloney’s comments “were wrong and by his resignation he accepts the hurt they have caused.”
The archdiocese learned about the email from Catholics at MIT and alumni. Moloney says he was trying to speak out against “cancel culture” and regrets his message has been misunderstood.
Suzy Nelson, an MIT vice president and dean for student life, sent an email to students calling Moloney’s comments “deeply disturbing” and “Father Moloney’s message failed to acknowledge the dignity of each human being and the devastating impact of systemic racism.”

GENEVA – A U.S. ambassador says the United States is committed to addressing its “shortcomings,” ahead of the U.N. human rights body's discussion of systemic racism and police brutality.
Andrew Bremberg, the U.S. ambassador in Geneva, noted President Donald Trump has condemned the actions of Minneapolis police officers involved in the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man. Trump signed an executive order on police reform on Tuesday.
“The United States recognizes and is committed to addressing its shortcomings, including racial discrimination, and injustices that stem from such discrimination, that persist in our society,” Bremberg said in a statement. “Every democracy faces challenges — the difference is how we deal with them.”
Bremberg says the executive order was “an example of how transparent and responsive our government leaders are in holding violators accountable for their actions and reforming our own system.”
The Human Rights Council in Geneva, following a call by African nations, will discuss “racially inspired human rights violations, systematic racism, police brutality and the violence against peaceful protests.”

NEW ORLEANS — The whereabouts of a statue of a slave owner toppled by protesters in New Orleans and thrown into the Mississippi River remain unknown after a group of men fished the bust out of the water.
A video shows the group using ropes and a plank to carry the paint-splattered bust of John McDonogh out of the river and onto a pickup truck Sunday.
Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s office told The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate the bust is “considered stolen property,” and whoever has it should contact the city regarding its return.
McDonogh left much of his money to New Orleans and Baltimore for schools, and many schools in New Orleans are named after him.
On McDonogh Day each year, schoolchildren from across the city lined up to lay flowers in a racially segregated ceremony. It was boycotted in the 1950s when African-American children would have to wait for hours for white children to lay their flowers first.

Richmond Police said they were alerted to the vandalism on Monument Avenue about 10:15 a.m. Wednesday. Police say red paint on the statue itself was already being removed by community members.
Authorities have information on possible suspects and are asking the community to call the Crime Stoppers line if they have information on who was responsible for the vandalism.
The monument was dedicated in 1996 to memorialize the Richmond native, who died in 1993, and to counterbalance the string of statues on Memorial Avenue dedicated to Confederate leaders.

ATLANTA — Georgia’s lieutenant governor is proposing a version of a hate crimes law for the state.
Republican Geoff Duncan called on lawmakers to create a free-standing hate crime and include more categories of bias crimes. Those would involve people victimized because of their culture and their status in exercising First Amendment rights, including worship, free speech, free press, assembly or petition of government.
A previous effort was found unconstitutional by the state Supreme Court more than a decade ago.
In February, Ahmaud Arbery was shot near Brunswick, Georgia. Investigators have said a white man uttered a racial slur after chasing Arbery down and shooting him.
Georgia’s House passed a simpler measure last year that’s been stalled in a Senate committee for more than year. The bill would add extra penalties onto crimes committed because of someone’s race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, mental disability or physical disability.

RICHMOND, Va. — Demonstrators in Richmond tore down another Confederate statue on Tuesday night.
The Howitzers Monument located near Virginia Commonwealth University’s Monroe Park campus was toppled after protesters spent the night marching in the rain and used a rope to pull it down from its pedestal.
A video from the Richmond Times-Dispatch shows the paint-splattered statue on the ground as the rain continued overnight in Virginia’s capital city.
It’s the third Confederate statue, and the fourth monument, to be torn down in Virginia since international protests erupted following the death of George Floyd by a white Minneapolis police officer who pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck.
Statues of Confederate president Jefferson Davis, Confederate Gen. Williams Carter Wickham as well as Christopher Columbus were toppled.
The protesters in Richmond started their march Tuesday night advocating for the removal of all Confederate statues, establishing a civilian policing review board and defunding the police, among other things.
The Howitzers Monument, showed a Confederate artilleryman standing in front of a gun, was erected in 1892 to memorialize the city’s Civil War artillery unit, according to the Encyclopedia of Virginia.

PORTLAND, Ore. — At least two Portland-based reporters have been hurt in recent days while covering protests against police brutality.
Oregon Public Broadcasting reports Oregonian journalist Beth Nakamura recounted being slammed by a baton. Portland Tribune reporter Zane Sparling said he was shoved into a wall by a police officer and hit by a crowd control munition.
The reporters say they identified themselves to police as press. In both incidents, the reporters were told by police, in what the journalists described as profanity-laced responses, that their press credentials did not matter.
Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler said on Twitter they were alarming incidents that need to be addressed.
Police spokesperson Lt. Tina Jones says they continue to work with media partners about the importance of following lawful orders so they can stay safe and avoid arrest or altercation.
However, members of the media have a fundamental right to do their jobs during demonstrations.

President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation was effective Jan. 1, 1863, but the news took time to travel. It wasn’t until June 19, 1865, when word of the proclamation was brought by the Union army to enslaved people in Texas.

AMSTERDAM — Vandals have daubed red paint and the word “racist” on a statue of Mohandas Gandhi in Amsterdam, amid a wave of attacks on statues around the world of controversial historical figures.
A worker cleaned the statue Wednesday with a high-pressure water hose. Gandhi, widely lauded for his peaceful campaign to win independence for India, has faced criticism for some of his writings about black Africans.
A lawyer, Gandhi traveled to South Africa in 1893 and stayed for two decades, fighting to expand rights for Indians there. He has faced criticism for referring in his writings to black South Africans as backward. However, he later changed his views and supported the rights of black South Africans.
His nonviolent resistance methods have been used in movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.

DETROIT — A white suburban Detroit police chief has been suspended for 30 days without pay and will undergo diversity training for inappropriate social media posts about people protesting the death of George Floyd.
Trustees in Macomb County’s Shelby Township voted 5-2 on Tuesday night on the punishment for chief Robert J. Shelide, who has held the title since 2015.
Shelide, who earlier apologized, told the township board before the vote that he is “not a racist” and “I bleed blue.”
Shelide had been on administrative leave the past two weeks while officials investigated posts on a now-deleted Twitter account. Screenshots posted on Facebook show one tweet spoke about the need to “unleash real cops” and describing protesters as “barbarians” and needing “body bags.“

PORTLAND, Ore. — Police say a man drove his car into a crowd of protesters early Wednesday in downtown Portland, injuring three people.
Police say the 27-year-old male driver drove away “at a high rate of speed,” but was tracked and arrested on suspicion of hit and run, reckless driving and possession of a controlled substance, according to The Oregonian/OregonLive.
Two people were taken by ambulance to a hospital. Another was taken for treatment in a personal car. Police say none of the injuries were life-threatening.

ATLANTA — Georgia’s lieutenant governor is proposing a version of a hate crimes law for the state.
Republican Geoff Duncan called on lawmakers to create a free-standing hate crime and include more categories of bias crimes. Those would involve people victimized because of their culture and their status in exercising First Amendment rights, including worship, free speech, free press, assembly or petition of government.
A previous effort was found unconstitutional by the state Supreme Court more than a decade ago.
In February, Ahmaud Arbery was shot near Brunswick, Georgia. Investigators have said a white man uttered a racial slur after chasing Arbery down and shooting him.
Georgia’s House passed a simpler measure last year that’s been stalled in a Senate committee for more than year. The bill would add extra penalties onto crimes committed because of someone’s race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, mental disability or physical disability.

GENEVA — The brother of George Floyd has made a heartfelt plea to the U.N.’s top human rights body to launch intense international scrutiny of systemic racism and the killing of unarmed blacks by police.
Philonese Floyd’s message by video to the Human Rights Council came as it contemplates an unprecedented bid sought by the Africa Group to create a Commission of Inquiry — the council’s most powerful tool of scrutiny — to examine and report on racism and violence against protesters by police in the United States.
“I am my brother’s keeper. You in the United Nations are your brothers and sisters’ keepers in America — and you have the power to help us get justice for my brother George Floyd,” Floyd said. “I am asking you to help him. I am asking you to help me. I am asking you to help us: Black people in America.”

HUNTINGTON, W.Va. — The Huntington City Council in West Virginia will vote Wednesday on a proposal to make Juneteenth a permanent city holiday.
The celebration commemorates when enslaved people in Texas learned they were free on June 19, 1865. Huntington Mayor Steve Williams told The Herald-Dispatch he supports the proposal and wants the city’s African American residents to know “the city celebrates Juneteenth with them just as we all celebrate July Fourth together.”
The mayor says the idea for the holiday proposal came from meetings with his diversity advisory committee amid the international protests following the death of George Floyd. Williams expects Wednesday’s meeting will help fast-track the resolution so council members can get it in the books before Friday.
The Emancipation Proclamation was signed by President Abraham Lincoln on Jan. 1, 1863, and freed enslaved people of the rebellion Confederate states.

HOUSTON — Officials say a statue of a Confederate soldier has been removed from a downtown Houston park and a second Confederate statue is expected to be removed soon.
The “Spirit of the Confederacy” statue was removed late Tuesday from Sam Houston Park. Mayor Sylvester Turner said last week the statue will be housed in the Houston Museum of African American Culture.
A second statue, of Confederate artillery commander Richard W. “Dick” Dowling, is also slated for removal. Initially, the Dowling statue was to be moved from Houston’s Hermann Park to the Sabine Pass Battleground State Historical Site near Port Arthur.
But officials say the Dowling statue will instead be placed in a warehouse, at least temporarily, after leaders in Port Arthur expressed opposition.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — A Roman Catholic chaplain at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has resigned at the request of the archdiocese after sending an email suggesting the killing of George Floyd was not an act of racism and he hadn’t lived “a virtuous life.”
The Archdiocese of Boston asked the Rev. Daniel Patrick Moloney to step down June 9 after he sent the message to Catholics at MIT, The Boston Globe reports. A statement from the archdiocese said Moloney’s comments “were wrong and by his resignation he accepts the hurt they have caused.”
The archdiocese learned about the email from Catholics at MIT and alumni. Moloney says he was trying to speak out against “cancel culture” and regrets his message has been misunderstood.
Suzy Nelson, an MIT vice president and dean for student life, sent an email to students calling Moloney’s comments “deeply disturbing” and “Father Moloney’s message failed to acknowledge the dignity of each human being and the devastating impact of systemic racism.”

GENEVA – A U.S. ambassador says the United States is committed to addressing its “shortcomings,” ahead of the U.N. human rights body's discussion of systemic racism and police brutality.
Andrew Bremberg, the U.S. ambassador in Geneva, noted President Donald Trump has condemned the actions of Minneapolis police officers involved in the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man. Trump signed an executive order on police reform on Tuesday.
“The United States recognizes and is committed to addressing its shortcomings, including racial discrimination, and injustices that stem from such discrimination, that persist in our society,” Bremberg said in a statement. “Every democracy faces challenges — the difference is how we deal with them.”
Bremberg says the executive order was “an example of how transparent and responsive our government leaders are in holding violators accountable for their actions and reforming our own system.”
The Human Rights Council in Geneva, following a call by African nations, will discuss “racially inspired human rights violations, systematic racism, police brutality and the violence against peaceful protests.”

NEW ORLEANS — The whereabouts of a statue of a slave owner toppled by protesters in New Orleans and thrown into the Mississippi River remain unknown after a group of men fished the bust out of the water.
A video shows the group using ropes and a plank to carry the paint-splattered bust of John McDonogh out of the river and onto a pickup truck Sunday.
Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s office told The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate the bust is “considered stolen property,” and whoever has it should contact the city regarding its return.
McDonogh left much of his money to New Orleans and Baltimore for schools, and many schools in New Orleans are named after him.
On McDonogh Day each year, schoolchildren from across the city lined up to lay flowers in a racially segregated ceremony. It was boycotted in the 1950s when African-American children would have to wait for hours for white children to lay their flowers first.

RICHMOND, Va. — A statue of African American tennis star Arthur Ashe has been vandalized.
Photos show the base of the monument tagged with white spray paint and the words “white lives matter” as well as the initials “WLM.” Those initials were later painted over with “BLM,” short for black lives matter.
Richmond Police said they were alerted to the vandalism on Monument Avenue about 10:15 a.m. Wednesday. Police say red paint on the statue itself was already being removed by community members.
Authorities have information on possible suspects and are asking the community to call the Crime Stoppers line if they have information on who was responsible for the vandalism.
The monument was dedicated in 1996 to memorialize the Richmond native, who died in 1993, and to counterbalance the string of statues on Memorial Avenue dedicated to Confederate leaders.

LAS VEGAS — The University of Nevada, Las Vegas has removed a statue of its “Hey Reb!” mascot from in front of its alumni center following an outcry from student groups, including the Native American Student Association.
The decision to remove the bronze statue, which was criticized for its relationship to the Confederacy, came weeks after the death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis.
University President Marta Meana says she has had conversations with individuals and stakeholders about how the university can move forward in light of recent events.
The statue is expected to be returned to its donors.

RICHMOND, Va. — Demonstrators in Richmond tore down another Confederate statue on Tuesday night.
The Howitzers Monument located near Virginia Commonwealth University’s Monroe Park campus was toppled after protesters spent the night marching in the rain and used a rope to pull it down from its pedestal.
A video from the Richmond Times-Dispatch shows the paint-splattered statue on the ground as the rain continued overnight in Virginia’s capital city.
It’s the third Confederate statue, and the fourth monument, to be torn down in Virginia since international protests erupted following the death of George Floyd by a white Minneapolis police officer who pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck.
Statues of Confederate president Jefferson Davis, Confederate Gen. Williams Carter Wickham as well as Christopher Columbus were toppled.
The protesters in Richmond started their march Tuesday night advocating for the removal of all Confederate statues, establishing a civilian policing review board and defunding the police, among other things.
The Howitzers Monument, showed a Confederate artilleryman standing in front of a gun, was erected in 1892 to memorialize the city’s Civil War artillery unit, according to the Encyclopedia of Virginia.

PORTLAND, Ore. — At least two Portland-based reporters have been hurt in recent days while covering protests against police brutality.
Oregon Public Broadcasting reports Oregonian journalist Beth Nakamura recounted being slammed by a baton. Portland Tribune reporter Zane Sparling said he was shoved into a wall by a police officer and hit by a crowd control munition.
The reporters say they identified themselves to police as press. In both incidents, the reporters were told by police, in what the journalists described as profanity-laced responses, that their press credentials did not matter.
Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler said on Twitter they were alarming incidents that need to be addressed.
Police spokesperson Lt. Tina Jones says they continue to work with media partners about the importance of following lawful orders so they can stay safe and avoid arrest or altercation.
However, members of the media have a fundamental right to do their jobs during demonstrations.

MARK TEPPER, STRATEGIC WEALTH PARTNERS: Good morning.
BARTIROMO: And now, some of the top stories that we are watching this morning.
Starting today, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut will impose a 14-day quarantine on travelers from coronavirus hot spots. The hot spots states currently on the list include Arkansas, Alabama, Arizona, South Carolina, Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Utah and Washington.
Many states across the country are seeing a spike in coronavirus cases with Texas, Arizona and Florida reporting record highs in spikes. Houston's largest hospital says its intensive care unit is now 97 percent filled, Florida recording more than 5,500 new cases yesterday alone.

The convention is scheduled to start on August 17th.
President Trump meanwhile visiting Wisconsin today, a key battleground state in the upcoming election. This as ""The New York Times"" poll shows that the president is trailing Joe Biden by 14 points at this point.
Battle for change, Senate Democrats moving to block the GOP police reform bill yesterday, claiming it is inadequate in addressing issues of police reform following the death of George Floyd. The bill gathered 55 votes. They fell short of the 60 votes needed to pass.
South Carolina Senator Tim Scott speaking on the Senate floor yesterday.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. TIM SCOTT (R-SC): As a black guy, I know how it feels to walk into a store and have the little clerk follow me around even as a United States senator. I get that.
But what I miss in this issue is that the stereotyping of Republicans is just as toxic and poison to the outcomes of the most vulnerable communities in this nation.
When Speaker Pelosi says one of the most heinous things I can imagine that the Republicans are actually trying to cover up murder, the murder of George Floyd, with our legislation. That's not politics.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BARTIROMO: The House of Representatives is set to pass its police reform bill today but it is expected to be blocked in the Republican majority Senate.
Joining me now is Arizona congresswoman, House Judiciary Committee and House Homeland Security Committee member, Debbie Lesko.
Congresswoman, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us.
Can you walk us through where the barriers are, where are the things that the two sides disagree on, on police reform?
REP. DEBBIE LESKO (R-AZ): Yes, thank you, Maria.
I told Representative Karen Bass, the Democrat that's really leading the Democrat House bill, that there are portions of her bill that I could support, that Republicans could support, that President Trump could support.
Unfortunately, there are several areas that law enforcement officers have told us would totally undermine their ability to protect communities. One is taking away their qualified immunity so that individual police officers could more easily be sued by citizens. Another one is totally banning -- outright banning chokeholds and carotid holds which sometimes is the last resort before a police officer shoots someone.
So, when I talk to different law enforcement, they said if you take away that option, then their only resort in some instances is to actually shoot and kill the person, which is the opposite of what you want done.
Another thing that the Democrat bill does is say that any military surplus that these law enforcement agencies get now for free or very low cost, they ban that. And I talked to police chiefs in Arizona that said they use some of this military equipment during floods, for legitimate services. They don't use it for, you know, going down the road militarizing things.
They use it when there's flash floods.
BARTIROMO: Yes.
LESKO: When they have to clear roads and those type of things.
And I am hopeful that we can get together, because this is such an important issue, and the Democrats didn't talk to the Republicans about this House bill. So I'm hopeful we can get something done.
BARTIROMO: Yes.
Well, you know, I asked A.G. Barr about the immunity, the qualified immunity. He said, look, if you don't have qualified immunity for the cops, you're going to get fewer and fewer people who sign on become a police officer. Because they're going to see much more risk if they don't have the qualified immunity.
So I understand that point that you make.
Let me bring Steve Forbes in. Go ahead, Steve.
FORBES: Congresswoman, in terms of a qualified immunity, we know we don't want a bunch of baseless lawsuits against police officers, but there have been numerous instances in the past where they've gone over the bounds, the courts have said they've gone over the bounds in certain arrests and there's no -- there's no recourse for people in many cases.
Is the way to make some modification without opening the floodgates to deal with genuine abuses? They've been videoed, some of these abuses.
LESKO: Yes, Republicans in Judiciary Committee did say they're willing to do reforms to qualified immunity because you're right, there are some cases that were egregious.
But just to outright ban it, that's bad. Not only is it bad for recruiting new police officers, but it's also bad because police officers need to make life and death decisions in quick seconds and they're going to think twice about doing something if they think they're going to be personally sued.
So, we're open to reforms. We're just not open to outright banning.
BARTIROMO: Yep. We're going to talk with Kevin McCarthy coming up, the GOP leader.
Let me switch gears, because an appeals court orders the case against Michael Flynn to be dismissed, Congresswoman. Lawyers for the former national security advisor released notes yesterday from the administration transition period and they show then President Obama and then Vice President Joe Biden weighed in on investigating Flynn.
During my exclusive interview with A.G. Barr, we talked about this and I asked him about the origins of the investigation that started with one conversation in a London bar.
Listen to this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BARTIROMO: But is there any evidence that in fact it was appropriate to launch an investigation other than a conversation in a bar? I know that George Papadopoulos had a conversation in a bar.
WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERALK: That is the official version of what happened. That comment in a London wine bar was what the basis really was for going forward. And I've said I thought that was a very slender read to get law enforcement intelligence agencies involved in investigating the campaign of one's political opponent.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BARTIROMO: Congresswoman, as you know, General Flynn was the first to be investigated with any ties to Trump. Then came Carter Page and George Papadopoulos with all the wiretaps and the informants running into them.
Your reaction to what took place yesterday?
LESKO: Well, thank God that the Appeals Court decided that way.
This whole thing stinks. The more and more we find out these handwritten notes by, we think, Peter Strzok yesterday that were revealed -- more and more we see how the Obama administration, James Comey, Peter Strzok, the Vice President Biden seemed to be involved as well as Obama, they were trying to take out President Trump and anyone affiliated with him and they're still trying to.
I mean, Nadler wants to bring in Attorney General Barr. Yesterday he had a whole bunch of people in bashing Attorney General Barr.
This whole thing is about political power. The Democrats want to influence the 2020 election. That's what the impeachment was all about. That's what all this stuff is about. And I assume it's going to continue up until the election.
BARTIROMO: Wow, I think people are really sick and tired of not seeing work get done and instead this constant focus on investigating the president.
Congresswoman, we'll keep watching. It's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much.
LESKO: Thank you.
BARTIROMO: Debbie Lesko, joining us there this morning.
Coming up, later on in the show, we've got a big hour, former Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta president Dennis Lockhart is here on the state of the economy and whether more stimulus is needed. Just as we get the GDP numbers out this morning.
And then at 8:00 a.m. Eastern, Michael Flynn's attorney Sidney Powell is here on her client's legal victory yesterday.

Stay with us.
BARTIROMO: Welcome back.
Big banks in focus this week. The Federal Research has their stress test results out after the close tonight and will provide a look at how the U.S. banking sector is faring amid the pandemic. Some worry the poll results could prevent some banks from being able to pay dividends to investors next quarter.
Let's get into it with RBC capital markets managing director, the head of U.S. Bank equity strategy and large cap bank analyst, Gerard Cassidy.
Gerard, it's great to see you. Thank you so much for joining me this morning.
GERARD CASSIDY, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS MANAGING DIRECTOR: You're welcome, Maria. Thank you.
BARTIROMO: So tell me about the stress tests. We've gotten used to the stress tests. Of course, the Federal Reserve came out with the stress test after the big financial upset in 2007.
What are you expecting tonight?
CASSIDY: That's right, Maria. You're absolutely right. We've been doing stress tests for over 10 years. And essentially they become nonevents, up until this year. And two changes made this year's stress test much more challenging for the banking industry.
There's a new measure of capital -- called the stress capital buffer that is being implemented this year, which will make it more challenging for the industry. But second, maybe more important, the Federal Reserve has put in a new what they call COVID-19 overlay on the economy.
As you well know, the economy has suffered dearly during this pandemic. And now, that is going to be factored into the stress test as well. So, the combination of those two factors meant this year's stress test which as you pointed out will be announced after the close today, to be much more important than what we've seen in the past.
BARTIROMO: So how will you characterize the health of the banks right now? I mean, obviously, people are under stress. Some banks will feel that more than others in terms of missing mortgage payments, et cetera. They have a lot of capital on their balance sheets, right? How do you assess?
CASSIDY: That's a very good point. Coming into this pandemic, the banking industry was very strong. They de-risked their balance sheets following the financial crisis in '08 and '09. They have much more capital, over two times the level of capital than they did in 2007. Liquidity is much greater than it was back then as well.
So they were in a very strong position to handle this downturn and we expect them to be able to get through it without having a capital problem. You might remember, Maria, not only was there an earnings issue back in '08, '09. We also had capital problems where the banks had to raise capital at distressed prices.
We don't see it happening this time. There is an earnings challenge, no doubt about it. There's going to be more credit loss as you might imagine, but we think the banks are strong and will be able to handle it as we get through this year.
BARTIROMO: That makes a lot of sense.
Let's bring in Mark Tepper. Go ahead, Mark.
TEPPER: Gerard, as you take a look at the banks, which loan portfolios in your opinion pose the biggest threat to the banks? Is it commercial real estate? Is it consumer loans? Business loans? Which ones pose the greatest risk?
BARTIROMO: Good question.
CASSIDY: It's a really good question, Mark, because in downturns, credit deterioration always appears and there are standard portfolios that suffer the post and probably the number one portfolio that will suffer is the so- called leveraged loan portfolio. These are the loans to borrowers, corporate borrowers that have excessive leverage and have very little room for mistakes, and in an economic downturn, it's very tough for those borrowers to make their payments. So, we expect to see a sizable increase in defaults in those portfolios.
Second, the other area that is always a challenge is construction lending. As you might imagine in a downturn the construction projects or commercial real estate construction projects will give them a challenge as well. What's new in this downturn however is that we have COVID-related industries as they're being called, so, the hospitality and leisure industry, which traditionally has never been a problem in an economic downturn, is going to be faced with real adversity because of what's going on today.
BARTIROMO: That's a really good point.
So, Gerard, walk us through your picks. Which banks would you be buying right here? Do you have any concerns that any of these banks are going to cut their dividend?
Remember what Jamie Dimon said at the beginning of the year -- look, if we are strained, we'll cut it. We're fine to do that. We'll look at it.
But, of course, this is the healthiest bank on the planet, JPM.
What do you like right now?
CASSIDY: Sure. In fact, we expect all the banks to come through with today's stress test with capital levels above the required minimums. However, because of the COVID overlay, we do anticipate that the Federal Reserve will talk to some banks about lowering their dividends.
One name that often comes up as a possibility is Wells Fargo in cutting that dividend.
But in terms of who we like, we think that Bank of America under Brian Moynihan has done a remarkable job in turning Bank of America around. They have completely de-risked that balance sheet. He's done an incredible job of increasing the profitability.
So, for an investor looking for a company that's not likely to cut the dividends and one of the biggest banks is, of course, Bank of America.
Another one is Truist. Remember, Maria, that was the merger between BB&T and SunTrust last year. They changed their name to Truist. Kelly King, the CEO there, has done a very good job of integrating those two companies.
And we anticipate with the cost savings that that company is going to achieve this added value that investors could have and again we don't expect a dividend cut there either.
BARTIROMO: All right. We will be watching tonight with the stress test.
Gerard, it's always a pleasure to talk with you. Thanks so much for joining me this morning.
CASSIDY: You're very welcome, Maria. Thank you.
BARTIROMO: We'll see you soon. Gerard Cassidy joining us, RBC.
Stay with us. We'll be right back.
BARTIROMO: Welcome back.
Nursing home crisis, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise slamming New York Governor Andrew Cuomo in a new op-ed, over his handling of the state's nursing homes during the coronavirus pandemic. It is titled Governor Cuomo can't dodge accountability for nursing home deaths forever.
In ""The New York Post"", he goes on to write, New York's handling of the crisis in its nursing homes has been a colossal failure. The failure demands investigation, we have to protect against similar tragedies in the future. New Yorkers deserve accountability and transparency. Cuomo, who is ultimately responsibility, has been neither accountable, nor transparent, writes Steve Scalise.
Dagen, this has been an issue that you've talked about quite a bit and it's horrible.
MCDOWELL: It makes me furious.
BARTIROMO: Yes.
MCDOWELL: And it makes me furious that more people are not calling out Governor Cuomo who is blamed the deaths of thousands of elderly people in New York nursing homes who essentially died because of an order that he issued that forced those nursing homes to take COVID positive patients back into the homes and ordered them to not test those elderly people.
He has blamed President Trump. He's blamed the CDC. He has literally blamed god, the wind, and the sun for this, instead of taking responsibility.
You want to see that order? You can't find it. Because it's been scrubbed from the Internet. But I do have this and I'm going to tweet it later.
It is a letter from the Society for Post Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine that essentially oversees nursing home employees, advising New York about the order and warning New York several days after the March order was issued by Governor Cuomo and his head of the death department, as I call it, warning them about what would happen.
Meantime, over on CNN, Cuomo and his little brother are still yakking it up with their magic act as Steven Miller calls it. I wish if it's -- you can read Chris Cuomo's tweet. It's really disgusting.
New York had an has had its struggles --
BARTIROMO: Yes.
MCDOWELL: -- but they're doing way better than what we see elsewhere and no way this happens without the Luv Guv dishing the real 24/7.
That is human ipecac. It is nauseating. And with that magic act, I wish that they could both wave a magic wand and bring back all of the elderly people who were killed because of the governor's order.
BARTIROMO: Well, I mean, he weighed in on the nursing home crisis last night, Dagen. Cuomo had comments about this. Do we have that sound bite? Listen to this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CHRIS CUOMO, CNN HOST: Nursing homes, people died there. They didn't have to. It was mismanaged and the operators have been given immunity. What do you have to say about that?
GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): The -- several statements that are not correct. But that's OK. It's your show. You say whatever you want to say.
The nursing homes were the most tragic situation. We have to figure out how to do it better the next time because there will be a next time, either a second wave or another disease, and if it is a disease that preying on the old and the weak, it's going to go to the nursing homes and the rehab centers.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MCDOWELL: He knew that -- he knew that -- he knew that beforehand.
(CROSSTALK)
BARTIROMO: Do you want to react to what you just heard?
MCDOWELL: He knew that beforehand when he signed the order that killed elderly people in nursing homes. Frankly, Janice Dean has talked about this with full heart and full --
(CROSSTALK)
BARTIROMO: Her in-laws, right?
MCDOWELL: Both of her in-laws, her mother and father-in-law died in nursing homes, rehab facilities in New York state.
BARTIROMO: Yes.
MCDOWELL: I can't -- it is all I have in me not to curse at this governor and the -- he acts like, well, we'll do it better next time. So you won't kill people next time? That's where we are with this?
He has literally blamed everybody without taking responsibility for this.
BARTIROMO: Yes.
MCDOWELL: And it is just beyond appalling and where are the Democrats being upset about this?
BARTIROMO: You haven't heard a word from them, Steve Forbes.
FORBES: Contrast that with Cuomo's behavior with Ron DeSantis, governor of Florida.
Back in March, he ordered the hospitals not to release patients and put them in nursing homes, even though hospitals reimbursement schedules would be mucked up. So, Florida took a proactive approach.
BARTIROMO: Yes.
FORBES: They had 4,400 nursing homes and facilities.
BARTIROMO: Yes, they did.
FORBES They took the opposite approach and saved thousands of lives in contrast in New York, and that's what makes it almost behavior. So abominable. Look what Florida did. They did the exact opposite.
BARTIROMO: Incredibly sad. All right, we'll take a break, when we come back we are awaiting key economic data this morning. The former president of the former -- of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta is here, the CEO, Dennis Lockhart, former CEO of Atlanta's Fed. Jobless claims, the final reading of the first quarter GDP, the economy. We're all going to look at that when we come right back. Stay with us.
BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Thursday, June 25.
It's to check the markets right now at 7:33 a.m. on the East Coast. We are looking at some weakness. Dow futures under pressure as investors watch a record spike in Coronavirus cases. Dow futures now down 166, the NASDAQ futures down 10, the S&P futures down 15 and a half.
In just about an hour's time we will get another look at the impact this pandemic is having on the American economy. When initial jobless claims are released, we will have those numbers as soon as they hit the tape, followed by reaction from National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow.
Plus, find out where he thinks stimulus is now and whether or not we need to see more stimulus to help aid this economy. Larry Kudlow joins me live in one hour's time.
Global markets this morning are mixed, European indexes erasing early losses as you say. The FT 100 is negative down 13 point but the CAC40 is up 16 and the DAX index in Germany is up 31 but a quarter of a percent higher.
In Asia overnight, it was South Korea and Japan on the move seeing declines. The KOSPI index down two and a quarter percent. Investors are fearing a much slower than expected recovery for the economies there as the coronavirus cases spike.
Markets in Hong Kong and China closed for holidays overnight.
NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace speaking out after the FBI determined he was not in fact the target of a hate crime. Cheryl Casone with those details now. Cheryl.
CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: That's right Maria. The NASCAR driver says he's relieved the rope that was found in his garage over the weekend was not a noose.
Wallace released a statement on Twitter saying in part, ""I think we'll gladly take a little embarrassment over what the alternatives could have been. This should not detract from the show of unity that we had on Monday and the progress we've made as a sport to be a more welcoming environment for all.""
While the entire NASCAR community showed their support for Wallace on Monday, there it is, escorting his car on the tracks at Talladega Superspeedway.
The FBI determined that rope was not a hate crime and had been in the garage since late last year. Videos read by the ""New York Post"" show several similar garage polls being used at Talladega in the past.
Well, Masayoshi Son, the CEO of SoftBank is stepping down from Alibaba's board after 15 years. Son made the announcement at the end of SoftBank annual shareholder meeting. His resignation effective today comes one month after Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma left SoftBank's board.
SoftBank is Alibaba's biggest shareholder. Mr. Son said the parting of the ways was smooth, and he hadn't lost confidence in Alibaba. But remember, SoftBank still keeps that 25 percent stake in Alibaba.
Son and SoftBank have been criticized after several of the company's investments and rework in Uber part of that vision fund sour.
Take a look at SoftBank shares up nearly 15 percent this year, unchanged in the pre-market.
And finally, here's a look at what is trending this morning on Foxbusiness.com. The extra $600 a week in unemployment benefits for out of work Americans set to expire at the end of July even as the coronavirus pandemic is still triggering layoffs.
California plans to ask a state court judge to force Uber and Lyft to classify their drivers as employees rather than contractors.
And GMC has filed for bankruptcy with plans to close 800 to 1,200 of its stores and they possibly are going to put themselves up for sale, Maria.
And those are your headlines from the newsroom. Back to you.
BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you.
Fears of a second coronavirus wave driving markets lower this morning and certainly yesterday. As you see the Dow futures down 176 points, the NASDAQ down 11 and the S&P down 16. This comes as investors brace for a handful of economic data out this morning.
Do out in about an hour from now another 1.3 million Americans expected to file for unemployment benefits last week. We also have the final read on first quarter GDP expected to contract 5 percent. But a positive outlook for many -- for the durable goods report for the month of May that is expected to be up 10.9 percent.
Joining me right now is former Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President and CEO, distinguished professor of the practice for the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs, Dennis Lockhart.
Dennis, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks very much for joining us.
DENNIS LOCKHART, FORMER FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF ATLANTA PRES AND CEO: Thank you, Maria. Good to be back. Thank you.
BARTIROMO: So before I get into what we're expecting in terms of this rise in coronavirus cases and whether that's going to change your expectation, where are you on the economy right now? Give us your status check in terms of growth, returning
LOCKHART: Well, I think we have seen some of the benefits of the reopening. At the same time, I would say the situation right now is a little bit ambiguous. So some of the data are positive and encouraging. For example, construction permits came out a few days ago. And then other data are a little bit more downbeat.
So I think we're in a little bit of a situation now and which we always have uncertainty, but which -- we're a little bit uncertain how this is going to play out over the summer.
BARTIROMO: So, do you still expect a 5 percent contraction in the first quarter? Are you expecting a sharp contraction in the second quarter up to 30 percent? What are those numbers?
LOCKHART: Yes, I think the 5 percent have already been booked a couple of times. So there's, I guess, one more final number to come. But the second quarter clearly will be, by far, the worst.
A contraction of 30 percent is quite, I think, quite plausible. After that, we'll begin to see improvement. And I really have no reason to argue with the Federal Open Market Committee projection of an annual contraction of around 6 percent.
BARTIROMO: I say, Mark Tepper.
MARK TEPPER, STRATEGIC WEALTH PARTNERS, PRESIDENT AND CEO: Dennis, helped me to understand what the disconnect is here. So, you know, the unemployment rate has been coming down. Yet there's still over a million new people filing for unemployment benefits every single week, are small businesses using the crisis as a cloak to trend employees that they don't need? What's going on here?
LOCKHART: Well, I haven't seen any, call it studied evidence on that, but there's a lot of anecdotal feedback to that. Some of the layoffs are likely to be permanent not temporary.
In the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, recession that followed that crisis and then the slow recovery. A lot of firms, in a way use the recession, as air cover to restructure their employment base. If this goes on for many more months, it would not surprise me to see similar behavior on the part of firms, small or even large firms who just decided they can operate with a smaller employee base.
BARTIROMO: So you think the job cuts will continue then. I mean Congress's July 4 recess just days away, the Trump administration is expected to negotiate another wave of stimulus checks after the holiday break. Dennis, do you see a need for more stimulus at this point? And what do you think 2021 looks like? Is that going to be the year when we start getting back on our feet economically speaking?
LOCKHART: Well, when the supplemental $600 runs out in July, and as unemployment benefits run out over the coming weeks and months, there could be a lot of households that are in pretty deep trouble. And then you're going to see the effect on rent payments, default -- credit card defaults, car payments, that kind of thing.
And so I can imagine if this does not go, well, the underlying epidemic does not go well, that we have a sort of cascading effect that continues. And, I mean, that could be the story really of this year and into next year. So, I don't think it's easy at the moment to come up with a high confidence prediction of what's going to happen.
I continue, as I said last time I was on your program, to think in terms of multiple scenarios. Some scenarios are optimistic and some are really not so optimistic. And I think there is a pretty wide range of outcomes that maybe we could see.
BARTIROMO: So, what are the odds things get worse economically later on in the year?
LOCKHART: What are the odds?
Well, I'm not going to put an exact probability on that. But I do you think there is a scenario
BARTIROMO: Right? Are you expecting things to get worse? Are you expecting things to get worse?
LOCKHART: Am I expecting things to get worst? The first answer is I don't know. But I certainly include in my outlook the possibility that things get worse. Yes.
BARTIROMO: All right, Dennis, we'll keep watching. Obviously we are -- we all want to get back to growth.
Dennis Lockhart, joining us this morning. It is good to see you, sir. Thanks very much.
Stay tuned. I'll be speaking with National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow in the next hour here on Mornings with Maria. We'll get his assessment coming up on where we are in terms of the economy.
We are zeroing in on the next jobs in America. Coming up, we're looking at the industries hiring even amid the COVID-19 downturn and where the growth in jobs will be in the coming year.
Plus, rocking the sports world, the New York City Marathon canceled as some of golf's most recognizable names pull out of a major tournament, all coming up.
Plus, be sure to tune in tomorrow, I'll be speaking with former NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly on policing in the United States, plus the surge in murder rates across the country. Don't miss that for an interview. We'll be right back.
BARTIROMO: So what are the next jobs in America? Of course constantly evolving as the country reopens. Despite high unemployment there are jobs out there, employment search website, CareerBuilder out with a list of industries desperate to beef up their payrolls. And joining us right now to learn more is CareerBuilder CEO, Irina Novoselsky
Irina, great to have you this morning. Thanks very much for being here.
Can you discuss with us what industries you are seeing actually seeing demand and needing to hire?
IRINA NOVOSELSKY, CAREERBUILDER CEO: Yes, so for the first time, the regular industries that we have been seeing for the last several weeks around tracking, logistics, and big box retailers continue to be lucky. But some of the new industries that are popping up are really around the tech services and cloud Customer Services areas.
We're also seeing manufacturing start to move on a jobs level. We're actually seeing software developers' increase. We're seeing customer service representatives having a much higher increase. And that's actually an interesting job because it fits with so many different skill sets that can help move some of the hospitality workers from one space into another one.
BARTIROMO: Yes, we got a great list that you've been going through here, the jobs that are in the most demand. Do you need a special skill set for these jobs?
NOVOSELSKY: No, not necessarily. For some, obviously, with accounting and some of the financial services roles and mortgages roles, you might. But one of the things that we've seen, and we've talked about this before COVID, and even more relevant now is 60 percent of the workforce is millennials and Gen Z, and they don't have the stereotypical resumes to begin with. And so one of the things that sites like ourselves and others are starting to really do is invest in that technology to do skills based matching.
So, making sure that on your resume and when you're searching, you're really highlighting the skills you have so that you can go from being a bartender to a customer service representative by highlighting your social skills or communication skills, your work ethic skills, and really leveraging those tools that you already had versus the experience that you might not.
BARTIROMO: So which specific employers are you seeing hiring the most right now? What do you think is behind those demand that you're seeing, specific employer?
NOVOSELSKY: Specific, we're seeing two categories. One is the ones that we've talked about the trucking companies, we've named the top 10 trucking companies, all of them are hiring. Clearly Amazon, CVS, Walmart, all the big box retailers are continuing to hire.
On the other side, one of the things that we're seeing is there's several companies and it's sprinkled across the country, but really from a tax perspective, that are looking to build their pipeline.
And so while they may not be actively hiring Maria, they're definitely starting to actively build their pipe so that when they are ready, they have really good talent that they can leverage and take advantage of and take advantage of and quickly hire.
BARTIROMO: All right, great advice and info there.
Irina, great to have you this morning. Thank you.
Irina Novoselsky --
NOVOSELSKY: Thank you.
BARTIROMO: -- from careerbuilder.com.
Coming up, rocking the sports world, the New York City Marathon canceled as some of golf's most recognizable names pull out of a major tournament, got all the details. Stay with us.
BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The coronavirus pandemic is not over yet and it is still causing social disruption. The 50th Annual New York City Marathon has been canceled for this November. City officials say it's too risky.
Five golfers including Brooks Koepka, Webb Simpson, all pulling out of the 2020 Travelers Championship after one of the caddies tested positive for COVID-19.
And then there's California's Disneyland originally slated for reopening next month that will be delayed once again after employees say that they don't feel like enough time has passed to feel safe. Disney's live action Mulan movie also could be delayed.
Dagen, we're seeing this all over again, it seems.
DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Right. I was kind of astonished when the New York City Ballet canceled the Fall Dance Season and including there's not going to be a Nutcracker. We've talked about that. So no Nutcracker in December.
But in terms of the marathon, I'll point out super storm Sandy hit New York City eight years ago this fall and Mayor Michael Bloomberg canceled the marathon just days before it was set to take place because there were so many devastation and death out on Staten Island in particular where the marathon starts and where the storm hit the hardest.
I just remember all those marathoners were actually mad that the marathon got canceled and they were running around in the streets on the sidewalk. We were just trying to get by and go to work and survive this storm. And these marathoners, particularly from Europe will like jogging in groups screaming it out, on your left, on your left, on your left. So, again, unless you can comport yourself. I don't think that New Yorkers really need all those folks here right now.
BARTIROMO: Mark, how do you see it?
TEPPER: It's unfortunate, you know, it doesn't matter if it's an amateur sporting event or a professional event. Participants are pulling out. Events are being canceled because of COVID fears COVID risks. Unfortunately, I just don't think it's going to change until we have an effective treatment. I mean, who would have thought that this would be happening in golf, which is completely outdoor social distancing at its finest.
BARTIROMO: Yes.
TEPPER: And the thing that really stinks is that this is all happening right now as baseball has finally gotten it together, they're finally ready to start. And now we're seeing this happening. So it stinks.
BARTIROMO: Yes, you're right.
And Steve Forbes, you are on the President's Committee and their advisory panel in terms of when to reopen. How do you see everything here? Are we seeing a second wave?
FORBES: You're seeing a spike, but I don't think it should shut down the economy. And I think unfortunately, Maria, a lot of this is being politicized in terms of the pace of reopening. And I don't think that should politics should play a role.
Baseball the -- unfortunately in baseball, the -- not unfortunately, but the players union won resounding victory again. So whether they play or not, the unions have shown when it comes to showdown with the owners. The players always hit the ball and the owners strike out.
BARTIROMO: All right, we will take a break. When we come back Michael Flynn's attorney is here. Sidney Powell on her client's legal victory next on Mornings with Maria right here. Stay with us."
179,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1001/Files (250).DOCX","Jpost.com (The Jerusalem Post online edition)",2020-09-30,"913 words",NA,"ANN LEWIS",NA,"Trump needs to normalize relations in America, as well as the Mid-East",FALSE,"I was deeply pleased to see Israel, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates come together at the White House to normalize the relations between their countries. I hope this courageous step inspires other Arab states to normalize ties with Israel, America's closest ally in the Middle East.
I understand that this positive news represents a welcome break for US President Donald Trump in advance of November's election. But it would be a mistake to predict that it entitles him to a large share of the Jewish-American vote, as his supporters suggest. Just as most Jewish-Americans welcome the news of normalized relations in the Middle East, we also want a president who will work to normalize relations in our own divided country. 
 Unfortunately, Trump has done the reverse – aggravating domestic divisions time after time, especially when he thinks it may be to his political benefit. It is not normal for the president of the United States to see ""very fine people"" on both sides of a neo-Nazi riot, deliberately overlooking the chants that ""Jews will not replace us."" Is anyone surprised that Donald Trump's winking at white supremacists has accompanied what the FBI describes as the highest levels of hate crimes against the Jewish-American community in our nation's history?
It is not normal to have a president who prefers to divide, who launched his presidential campaign in 2015 by slandering Mexican immigrants as rapists and drug dealers, who refers to the current pandemic with ugly slurs such as ""the Chinese virus"" and ""kung flu,"" and minimizes the death toll from ""blue states.""
""If you take the blue states out,"" Trump said on September 16, ""we're at a level that I don't think anybody in the world would be at. We're really at a very low level."" News flash, Mr. President, we're not taking the blue states out.
It is not normal that more than 200,000 Americans have been killed this year in red and blue states, by a mismanaged public health crisis – more lives lost than Americans fighting the Korean War, Vietnam War, Gulf War, the War in Afghanistan and Iraq War combined. We will not forget hearing the president admit on tape that during the early, crucial months of this year he deliberately lied to the American people about the severity of the disease for the sake of rosier economic headlines.
It is certainly not normal that a president of the United States, who has sworn an oath to protect our nation, continues to ignore or contradict the judgment of scientists and medical professionals about safeguarding the nation's health, flouts public health guidelines by encouraging his supporters to attend political rallies without basic safeguards, and continues to try to revoke health coverage for millions of Americans – even during a pandemic.
 cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });
It is not normal – it is appalling – that this same president, claiming to be a champion of ""law and order,"" while he disregards state and local regulations, now refuses to acknowledge that he will abide by the outcome of the coming election, regardless of its conclusion!
The peaceful transfer of power is a cherished American legacy, recognized around the world as a proof of a healthy democracy. Normal would be a president who appreciates that he is the custodian of that legacy; unfortunately, that is not the president we have now.
As we marked the start of our children's school year and this most unusual of High Holy Days, when even our most basic religious rituals and daily routines have been sadly disrupted, I too wish for a return to normal conditions. But I know that I cannot count on Donald Trump to lead us there.
We will not return to normal with a president who gives occasional lip service to fighting antisemitism while repeating dangerous stereotypes about Jews, in private and in public; calling us globalists, disloyal Americans, who excel at counting money and want to control politicians. Who ""stick together"" and are ""only in it for themselves.""
I have heard suggestions from Trump's supporters that I should overlook his words, which even they agree can be ""regrettable."" But the words of the president of the United States have power: The power to mobilize against a common threat; the power to unite us in pursuit of a higher goal, the power to build that more perfect union.
Unfortunately, Donald Trump chooses words that inflame. He seeks to retain power by dividing Americans at the expense of the most vulnerable – a strategy that throughout history has had painful, even deadly, consequences for Jews.
So do I join with the Jewish-American community in celebration that Bahrain and the UAE are normalizing relations with Israel, and hope that other Arab countries will soon follow? Absolutely. At the same time, I am doing all I can to elect Joe Biden, who has a decades-long record of supporting Israel's security, opposing extremism and antisemitism – and protecting normal life here at home.

Grace Meng:
Nonprofit Security Grants will help 16 borough synagogues and educational institutions with protecting their properties against threats and attacks
U.S. Rep. Grace Meng (D-Queens), a member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, announced today that $1.6 million in federal funding for security improvements has been awarded to 16 Jewish facilities throughout Queens, along with funds for two Christian facilities.
The funds are allocated through the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Nonprofit Security Grant Program, the initiative that provides houses of worship and nonprofit entities with funding to protect their properties against threats and attacks. The grants, which are administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), cover target-hardening and other physical security enhancements such as barriers, gates, safety gear, surveillance equipment, and other safety measures.
Each Queens facility receiving funds, which consist of synagogues and educational institutions, was awarded the maximum grant amount of $100,000. They include the following:
Reform Temple of Forest Hills
$100,000
Young Israel of Hillcrest
$100,000
Rabbinical Seminary of America in Kew Gardens Hills
$100,000
Young Israel of Queens Valley in Kew Gardens Hills
$100,000
Torah Center of Hillcrest
$100,000
Forest Hills Jewish Center
$100,000
Jewish Center of Forest Hills West in Middle Village
$100,000
Shaarey Bnos Chayil Institute in Kew Gardens Hills
$100,000
Congregation Ohr Menachem in Forest Hills
$100,000
Utopia Jewish Center in Fresh Meadows

Jewish Institute of Queens in Elmhurst
$100,000
Bais Yaakov Academy for Girls in Kew Gardens
$100,000
Yeshiva of Central Queens in Kew Gardens Hills
$100,000
""Following the increase in hate crimes and anti-Semitic incidents, it is vital that Jewish facilities have the resources they need to protect themselves, and these critical funds will be a huge help in guarding against attacks here in Queens,"" said Meng. ""For years, I have worked to expand funding and awareness of these grants, and after last December's horrifying attack in Monsey, I urged more local facilities to apply. Many did so and I'm pleased to have worked with several of them to help secure this money. We cannot let our guard down for a moment. Safety and security must continue to be the number one priority, and I remain committed to doing everything possible to ensure that Jewish facilities are protected from those who seek to do harm.""
The grant awards come after Meng held a workshop in Queens this past January that helped houses of worship and nonprofits in the borough learn about the Nonprofit Security Grant Program, and how they could successfully apply for funding. The Congresswoman hosted the event in Kew Gardens prior to this year's application deadline which was in March.
As a member of the House Appropriations Committee the panel that funds all U.S. government agencies, programs, and projects, including the Nonprofit Security Grant Program Meng has helped to increase funding of the grants over the last several years, boosting the initiative to a record $90 million for current fiscal year 2020.
Meng also announced grants for the following non-Jewish facilities:
Our Lady of the Blessed Sacrament Catholic Academy in Bayside
$57,000
Church on the Hill in Flushing

""Since March, we have seen a dramatic and disturbing increase in reports of hate crimes and racist incidents against Asian Americans,"" said Congresswoman Maloney. ""These racist incidents include physical and verbal assaults, and reports of individuals being barred from establishments, and Uber and Lyft rides. We've also seen Asian American owned businesses targeted for vandalism. Congress needs to send a strong message that this is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. I was proud to stand with my colleagues today in voting for H.Res. 908 to send that message loud and clear.""
Background:
H.Res. 908, Condemning All Forms of Anti-Asian Sentiment As Related to COVID-19:
* Calls on all public officials to condemn and denounce any and all anti-Asian sentiment in any form.
* Recognizes that the health and safety of all Americans, no matter their background, must be of utmost priority;
* Condemns all manifestations of expressions of racism, xenophobia, discrimination, anti-Asian sentiment, scapegoating, and ethnic or religious intolerance.
* Calls on federal law enforcement officials, with state and local officials:
- To expeditiously investigate and document all credible reports of hate crimes and incidents and threats against the Asian American community in the United States;
- To collect data to document the rise of incidences of hate crimes due to COVID-19; and
- To hold the perpetrators of those crimes, incidents, or threats accountable and bring such perpetrators to justice.

At today's House Financial Services Subcommittee on Investor Protection, Entrepreneurship, and Capital Market hearing, ""Insider Trading and Stock Option Grants: An Examination of Corporate Integrity in the Covid-19 Pandemic,"" Congresswoman Carolyn B. Maloney (D-NY), senior member of the committee, highlighted the Committee on Oversight and Reform's investigation into the Trump Administration's decision to loan $765 million to Kodak to support the production of ingredients for generic drugs as well as trading activity by company executives and board members before the loan was announced.
The Congresswoman also highlighted her legislation - the 8-K Trading Gap Act - which passed the House earlier this year and would close a loophole in current law that allows corporate executives to trade on information before its disclosed to the public and to their own shareholders.
During the hearing, the Congresswoman stated, ""the Oversight Committee continues to investigate the reasoning behind the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation's decision to provide the loan and whether they violated their own policies and procedures, and whether Kodak shared any material, non-public information before the announcement was made public.""
The Congresswoman also said, ""earlier this year the House passed my legislation - the 8-K Trading Gap Act - with overwhelming bipartisan support [...] Right now, when there's a significant corporate event at a public company, the company has to disclose that significant event to the public by filing a Form 8-K within four days of the event occurring. Of course, during this four-day gap, executives at the company know about the significant event, but other investors don't. My bill would address this problem by simply prohibiting executives from trading during this four-day gap.""

Background
* On July 28, U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) announced that it would loan $765 million to Kodak.
* On June 23, Kodak's CEO bought roughly 46,700 company shares, and a member of Kodak's board purchased 5,000 company shares. The CEO's stock purchase reportedly increased in value from nearly $104,000 to more than$1.5 million at one point following the July 28 announcement.
* The day before the loan was announced, Kodak's board also awarded its CEO $1.75 million stock options. According to media reports, based on the increased value of these shares after the announcement, these options could have been worth $50 million in late July.
* On August 4, Congresswoman Maloney, Chairwoman of the Committee on Oversight and Reform - along with Rep. James E. Clyburn, Chairman of the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, and Rep. Maxine Waters, Chairwoman of the Committee on Financial Services - sent a letter to Kodak seeking documents and information regarding this loan, as well as trading activity by company executives and board members before this loan was publicly announced.
* The Chairs, along with Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Eliot Engel and Chairman Al Green of the Financial Services Committee Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, also sent a letter to Adam Boehler, Chief Executive Officer of the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), seeking documents related to this loan.
* On August 7, DFC announced in a tweet: ""On July 28, we signed a Letter of Interest with Eastman Kodak. Recent allegations of wrongdoing raise serious concerns. We will not proceed any further unless these allegations are cleared."" Assistant to the President Peter Navarro responded: ""VERY disappointed last week's great deal with Kodak tarnished by allegations. Absolutely RIGHT move by DFC!""
* Also on August 7, Kodak announced it was launching an ""internal review of recent activity by the Company and related parties in connection with the announcement of a potential loan"" from DFC.
* Today, in response to an internal report from Eastman Kodak Company lawyers, Chairs Maloney, Clyburn, and Waters noted that the report raised more questions than it answered, and urged the Securities and Exchange Commission to independently and carefully review this matter.

The man asking that question then began shouting obscenities at the office of Infrastructure and Communities Minister Catherine McKenna. It was a blizzard of violent and foul language. At one point, the man, filming himself, called her a ""c-t.""
One of the eeriest things? He called her by her first name, part of a social media campaign to demean her. He felt he had that right. She is not a minister of the Crown, she is his.
McKenna once had that word sprayed in red across her Ottawa constituency office. She has had to ask Rebel Media to not refer to her as "" climate Barbie."" And Laura Dudas, an Ottawa city councillor who has faced constant sexualized insults, last week had rocks thrown through the window of her home.
Attacks on politicians, particularly females, are ""accelerating,"" McKenna told the CBC, ""and I think that a lot of what we've seen happen south of the border comes up here, and it is exacerbated by social media."" The police are launching a hate crime investigation and that sounds about right.
Good men are supporting women when foul attacks like this take place in an increasingly toxic and violent atmosphere poisoned by the Trump era. Other men don't. NDP Charlie Angus recently said Margaret Trudeau is nothing more than a famous surname. The virulent Maxime Bernier said she has accomplished nothing in life beyond marriage and childbirth.
Misogynists are targeting women more during the pandemic than they did earlier. Why? We women are in a much-weakened position. The pandemic has killed more women's jobs than men's, and has made working from home much more difficult because of lack of child care and doing most of the domestic workload.
One despairs. Good men back feminism; without them, women can't win. We team up. Feminism helped bring more women into the workforce but when will they win power in the workplace? If we measure power by money, men have more. I suspect they will always have more until more men come to support equal rights.
As dusk arrives earlier and earlier, I am less free to walk around my neighbourhood after work (in a home office) where there have been several violent attacks on women outdoors. Domestic violence - attacks on women and children in the home - is increasing and shelters are becoming full.
We women can't do it alone. Look at how hard it is to be a woman in politics, fearing physical violence and crude insults just for having been born female.
And then there is another more sinister question. Do women still exist? The word ""women"" is vanishing. This week, a male New York Times reporter wrote about gay men having children. This was his first sentence: ""While plenty of New Yorkers have formed families by gestational surrogacy, they almost certainly worked with carriers living elsewhere.""
Pregnancy is now ""gestational surrogacy."" A pregnant woman is not human; she is a ""carrier."" The word ""woman"" is not used until near the end when feminist Gloria Steinem, 86, is mentioned.
Normally I would not write about a dull American paper's use of language. It's not of interest to Canadians; there are more elegant papers to quote. But it's a huge mainstream paper and its sexist prose gradually smokes into general conversation, in the same way that Trumpish attitudes to women headed north.
In the liberal Guardian this week, a female reporter wrote about a rape survivor, Georgina Fallows, being unable to wear a face mask because it immediately brought back the terror of being raped by a man whose hand was over her mouth. Traumatized, she finds herself abused in public for going unmasked.
The story does not mention ""women"" even once. If the intent is not to exclude male rape victims who can't wear face masks, it is not clear there are any because victims' sex or gender go unmentioned. Yet rape is a current and present danger for all women, smaller and weaker than their rapists. Rape is so rarely prosecuted that Britain has almost decriminalized it.
And now this. With women enduring every disadvantage already, we ""women"" and ""girls"" are vanishing from English speech. It bodes ill for women's rights.

Aired 7-7:30a ET",FALSE,"[07:00:00]
ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN NEW DAY: We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and all around the world. This is New Day.
In the space of a little more than two weeks, change has begun in the U.S. 12 cities and municipalities have taken action to ban chokeholds by police officers after George Floyd's killing. And in just a few hours, Floyd's brother will testify before the House Judiciary Committee on how to move forward from here.
House Democrats have already proposed sweeping reforms to policing. Republicans are now drafting plans of their own. But President Trump's contribution, so far, has been to spread a blatant lie about a 75- year-old peace activist who was shoved to the ground and injured by a Buffalo police officer.
JOHN BERMAN, CNN NEW DAY: There are now developments this morning in the investigation of George Floyd's death. Minneapolis News Station KMSP is reporting that Derek Chauvin, the officer who pinned George Floyd to the pavement with his knee to his neck for nearly nine minutes, was in talks to plead guilty before he was arrested and charged with murder. Those negotiations reportedly fell apart.
Meanwhile, there are calls for investigations about voting problems in Georgia. A complete meltdown is what the Atlanta Journal Constitution called it after voters waited hours in line in the hot sun yesterday. Absentee ballot applications never returned. So why did this all happen? And can it be fixed by November?
Let's begin though on Capitol Hill with our Boris Sanchez. And, Boris, we are seeing actual plans for change now.
BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right, John. Philonise Floyd set to testify before the House Judiciary Committee. He is set to tell his brother, George's story, to share the pain and grief that he's experienced and losing his brother to law enforcement. And he is part of a list of witnesses that are set to build a case that systemic racism in law enforcement is real and needs to be addressed.
That is something that President Trump has not acknowledged. The president standing firm in his law and order stance, still deliberating whether or not he's going to address the issue on the issue of racial unity. Aides to the president tell CNN that in recent days, they've tried to relay their own personal experiences with racism to the president. Sources tell us that the president has been open to that, that he's been receptive.
They also tell us that the president is open to some kind of police reform legislation, though the details of that remain murky. The president sending his chief of staff, Mark Meadows, and his son-in- law, Jared Kushner, to Capitol Hill yesterday, to meet with Senator Tim Scott, who is leading the Republican Senate effort to build some form of legislation.
A draft of that legislation was released yesterday. It is much more measured than the Democrat version that was released on Monday from Democrats in the House. It includes a far-ranging set of motions, including anti-lynching measures, as well as a ban on chokeholds nationally. The Republican version does not include that. It essentially leaves a ban on chokeholds up to local governments.
We should point out, already, a number of local governments and municipalities have banned chokeholds, have banned that practice, places like Washington, D.C., New York, Miami, et cetera. It is still a very wide-open question what these two sides are willing to compromise on and, of course, what President Trump will finally sign off on. John?
BERMAN: Yes, Boris Sanchez on Capitol Hill. President Trump is nowhere on this right now, hasn't said a thing about what he would expect or what he wants to see, and that's crucial.
So joining us now, CNN Early Start Anchor, Laura Jarrett, who covered the Justice Department for a while, CNN Political Commentator Bakari Sellers is here with us, as well. He's the author of the book, My Vanishing Country.
Laura, let's put it back up on the screen so people can see these various proposals. The Democratic proposal is in writing at this point. In addition, it includes significant changes to the qualified immunity enjoyed by police officers in terms of lawsuits right now. And you can see some of the ideas being kicked around by Republican Senator Tim Scott. Again, it doesn't go as far as the Democratic plan.
But a couple of things are notable, really, to me, Laura. Number one is that Republicans haven't been critical of the Democratic plan yet. They're not bashing it the way that plans normally get bashed when proposed by one party or another, which indicates to me they know that they have to come up with something, which is why you're seeing Republican Senator Tim Scott scrambling right now.
[07:05:00]
They know that the country is calling for action now.
LAURA JARRETT, CNN ANCHOR: Yes, they're reading the room. They realize that they need to do something. And, look, federal policy is important. It makes a lot of sense in Tim Scott's version to say to states, look, if you're not having officers turn on body cameras, that's a problem and we may have to withhold funding.
But I think the concern for a lot of people is that these are just crumbs and really scratching at the surface of a much, much broader problem, that they will do these things, they will pack up and go home and say, you know what, our job is done. When in reality, a lot of the policing issues are happening at the local level. That's why we see so many states banning chokeholds.
And even in those cases, a lot of other people are saying, look, you know, some of these reforms we're seeing on the local level don't go far enough. In Minneapolis, officers had to go through cultural sensitivity training and that still didn't help George Floyd.
CAMEROTA: And, Bakari, isn't it strange to hear nothing from the president? I mean, I know we're three years into this and nothing should surprise us, but silence, while these nationwide protests, while all of the polls suggest that the public sentiment has changed in the past two weeks. And you see Congress taking action quickly, which is also striking, and nothing, no statement from the president other than these conspiracy theory, repugnant tweets. He gets them off of some fake cable network that finds them on a fringe website. That's the message he wants to put out.
BAKARI SELLERS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I'm not surprised. And I actually think that the country can better heal itself if the president stays out of this. I know that's kind of unique to say that we don't need to involve the president of the United States in one of the largest issues that it's facing right now at its most critical juncture we've had in the most recent 50 or 60 years, but that's the case. I mean, we can go without Donald Trump.
I am excited that Tim Scott is at the table. I am excited that Tim Scott is pushing forth ideas. And I know that these ideas may not go far enough to address the systemic racism that we have that's at the core of many of our systems in this country. However, Tim Scott does come with these experiences. I'm interested to see the testimony today from George Floyd's brother.
On the other hand though, you actually have people in the Republican Party, we have to be mindful, who believe that -- who believe that systemic racism does not exist. I mean, Dan Bongino is testifying on behalf of the Republicans. So you're going to have this messaging come out and emanate from the Republican Party that says that systemic racism does not exist. That's why I'm happy that Tim Scott is at the table. And I do believe something will happen.
But to Laura's point, now that George Floyd has been buried, now that we're shifting gears into solutions, will we be bold in trying to fix these solutions, or will we just nibble around the edges and move on?
BERMAN: Well, Laura, what's the difference? Can I ask? I mean, if we can put up on the screen so people can see the various proposals that are being, the ones by the Democrats and the ones by Republicans, what would count as a major structural change and what counts as nibbling around the edges? JARRETT: Well, I think the qualified immunity issue is actually a huge deal. And it may sound like sort of legal mumbo jumbo, but it's a big deal. Because what it means is essentially federal officers are off the hook, unless there has been a clearly established rule, which means that the Supreme Court has actually spoken on that issue, officers can point to that and say, look, I am not guilty in this case. And so I think there are actually legal rules that have allowed for a long time people not to be held accountable.
But I also think that, you know, senators need to listen to their communities and what their communities are asking for. And a lot of cases, it's not just reform measures. They want to radically change how policing is done. I mean, our T.V. screens are full right now of an enormous amount of police using force on citizens, even after the death of George Floyd. And so I think they're trying to -- the protesters are really right to reimage what police would look like in this country.
CAMEROTA: Former Vice President Joe Biden is trying to, I guess, well, be a voice for all of this and step into the void that President Trump is leaving. And so last night, he did talk about his view on systemic racism. Listen to this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
NORAH O'DONNELL, CBS NEWS ANCHOR: Do you believe there is systemic racism in law enforcement?
JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Absolutely. But it's not just in law enforcement. It's across the board. It's in housing and it's in education and it's in everything we do. It's real, it's genuine, it's serious.
Look, not all law enforcement officers are racist. My Lord, there are some really good, good cops out there. But the way in which it works right now, and we've seen too many examples of it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CAMEROTA: Bakari, do you think that he's having some impact? Do you think his voice is being heard in the middle of all of this tumult?
[07:10:01]
SELLERS: Yes, I mean, that was pitch perfect. I mean, that is what people of color, black folks have been screaming for 40, 50, 60 years. I mean, Alisyn and John, think about this. It took us seven years to get to the point where people would even say Black Lives Matter. I mean, seven years, that's how long the movement has been going and now finally people are saying it and we're putting forth solutions and we have a candidate for president of the United States who acknowledges this.
This moment is larger than George Floyd. And that's the challenge. This is a -- this is a seminal moment in our country's history. And it seems as if Joe Biden is ready to tackle that moment, even with all of his flaws and even with some of his stumbles, he's ready to tackle the moment.
On the flip side, you have to look at Donald Trump, who's ill-equipped for this moment. And we talk about, where is Donald Trump? I know that The Rock, Dwayne Johnson, had this amazing and lengthy video on social media asking, where is our leader? Well, many times you don't want the arsonist coming back and doing something with the fire.
And so we sit here today just thirsting for leadership, but that leadership has to have empathy. We have an empathy void in this country, one that Donald Trump cannot feel. And the question is whether or not people will support Joe Biden and he'll continue to lift this message up between now and November.
BERMAN: The thing is, the president has to sign a legislation if Congress passes something and the president has to sign it. So he can't be completely removed from this process. And in terms of what he's doing, we saw what he was doing yesterday with this just absurd, blatant lie about Martin Gugino, the 75-year-old peace activist in Buffalo who was pushed to the ground, blood pouring from his head, suggesting it was some kind of conspiracy theory.
Now, I agree with you on the sense, Bakari, it's not surprising from the president at this point. We've seen that before. Just because it's not surprising though doesn't mean that it's offensive. And it should be easy for politicians of any flavor or party to condemn such a statement. But look how not eased it was. Look how hard Republicans worked. Look at the gymnastics that they performed, trying to avoid these questions yesterday.
Listen to this.

REPORTER: What about the president's tweet though? Was that appropriate, sir?
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): As I said, we are discussing in the Senate Republican Conference, what response we think is appropriate to the events of the last two weeks.
REP. KEVIN KRAMER (R-ND): I just saw the tweet and I know nothing of the episode, so I don't know. I'm not as fixated, I guess, as some people.
MANU RAJU, CNN SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: You saw the president's tweet this morning when he talked about this Buffalo protester.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I haven't read the damn thing, I don't want to hear it.
RAJU: I know.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BERMAN: Okay. You could have just said, it was bad, he shouldn't have done it. That took me less than three seconds to say. But each of those senators pulled a muscle trying to avoid a question there.
Laura, you can see them just -- it just seems like such an opportunity missed to take a stand.
JARRETT: Look, time and again, they have made their gamble that they don't have to say anything and that he will do something else and the media cycle will move on and we will go through this over and over and over again. But the real test is what happens in November and whether people are actually going to hold their elected officials accountable.
We have seen already, Trump's poll numbers are slipping, and the campaign knows it. Even among white evangelicals, they don't like what they're seeing. The question is just what actually happens when people go to the polls.
CAMEROTA: Yes. And, Bakari, I mean, it has become just so notable when Republicans now do speak out against the president's tweets. I mean, now it -- when Mitt Romney says it was a shocking thing to say, and I won't dignify it with further comment, when, you know, Senator Thune says, it's a serious accusation, which should only be made with facts and evidence and I haven't seen any, and when Lisa Murkowski says, it just makes no sense that we're fanning the flames at this time. This is not good. That is notable and do you think that is a shift?
SELLERS: That's a good question, Alisyn. I mean, the bar is so low. I mean, I remember back in the day when we actually were mad at a president for wearing a tan suit or using Dijon mustard. I mean, that's where we once were. I mean, this is absurd.
And to applaud Mitt Romney or Murkowski or actually having some semblance of character is -- I just don't want to applaud that. I think that the damage that Donald Trump has done to the Republican Party is something that's going to be felt for the next decade.
I mean, I'm not the person to do it, and I'm not smart enough, but I wish there was someone who could come on this show and write a book on how Donald Trump has crumbled the moral fiber of the Republican Party, how he shifted the moral compass of this party, how he's lowered the standards and expectations of the White House from someone who was held to the highest standard, the black man we had elected, the 44th president, to someone who can literally, if he puts together a complete sentence we cheer for, and if people speak out against him being rude, we count that as a victory for that person.
[07:15:18]
My, my, my, things have changed in just four years. And the bar is so low that it only takes a little bitty hop. Maybe even John Berman can get over it.
BERMAN: Even I can jump higher than that bar.
Bakari Sellers, you have written a book, I should note, it's called, My Vanishing Country, now available in bookstores, and now I hope that you feel bad for making fun of me now that I've promoted your book. CAMEROTA: And his hopping skills.
BERMAN: Thanks, Bakari, I appreciate it. Laura Jarrett, great to have you on.
So it has been called a complete meltdown in Georgia. What happened yesterday when voters tried to cast their votes, what a mess, in line for hours, absentee ballots never delivered, what went on here? We ask the state's lieutenant governor, next.
CAMEROTA: Officials in Georgia are calling for an investigation after this scene played out at polling places yesterday.
[07:20:05]
Voters stood in line for hours after a cascade of problems with voting machines.
The front page of the Atlanta Journal Constitution calls it this morning a complete meltdown.
Joining us now is Georgia's lieutenant governor, Jeff Duncan. Lieutenant Governor Duncan, thank you very much for being here. I know yesterday wasn't easy. Let me just tick through a litany of the complaints that voters had.
Poll workers struggled with the new machines. They didn't feel they had had enough training on the new paperless voting system. There were long lines. The touch screens didn't work. They had to process paper ballots by hand. Many people never received their absentee ballots. Voters had to wait multiple hours in line exposing them to a coronavirus risk. How did Georgia screw this up so badly?
LT. GOV. JEFF DUNCAN (R-GA): Well, thanks for the opportunity to be here. And you know, the sun is starting to rise and we're starting to gather all the information necessary to figure out the things and the areas that we can improve.
I know that here in Georgia, like many other states, there's a split responsibility between the secretary of state and the local county election offices. And certainly, they're all in that process of doing a deep dive and debriefing on opportunities to improve.
You know, I think, you know, you describe many of the issues and the challenges that we faced. We have new machines that are implemented statewide. You've got obviously the coronavirus social distancing and then you've also had a wave of storms come through Atlanta and the Atlanta metro area.
In my particular county, we had no issues. I voted with an absentee ballot. My wife and my 18-year-old son got to vote for the first time and they came home and said that they spent less than 20 minutes in their places. But certainly, we're going to go through a full review here and continue to look for an opportunity to put an even better foot forward in November.
CAMEROTA: Can you guarantee voters there that this will not happen in November?
DUNCAN: Well, certainly, that's the goal, right? I think we can all learn from this and hopefully we can continue to really work on training. I think initial feedback is that we can continue to do a much better job as a state and as counties, individual counties, training the poll workers on the equipment and the processes. But also, I want to encourage everybody here in our state to take an opportunity to potentially volunteer.
I think some of the feedback we got is there wasn't enough volunteers. And, typically, those are going to be older folks, more on the retired side that typically volunteer in those polling centers and obviously with corona, that creates a little bit of an obstacle.
CAMEROTA: It sounds like, as you said here this morning, that you're not that confident or entirely confident that this won't happen again in November.
DUNCAN: Well, certainly, we'll do all that we can do to make sure we put an even better foot forward. And like I said, those techniques are going to be better training, better education, and like we would in the business world, we're going to do a deep dive into the project and we're going to understand the best foot that we can put forward and better techniques to implement as we go forward.
CAMEROTA: Let's talk about the Ahmaud Arbery case. As well know, Georgia is just one of four states that does not have a hate crime law. Investigators say that when Ahmaud Arbery was shot down, a horrible racial slur was uttered in the commission of that crime. And this week, his mother is calling for Georgia to change its ways, to change its laws, and she's calling on you specifically. Let me play for you what she said.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
WANDA COOPER-JONES, MOTHER OF AHMAUD ARBERY: Last year, Georgia statehouse moved in the right direction, passing House bill 426, which will impose harsher sentencing for hate crimes. But the bill has been stalled for a year and state and Senate Leadership refuses to vote on it. Chairman Jesse Stone and Lieutenant Governor Duncan, please do the right thing.
State senators are going back into session. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle support this, pass a hate crime law.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CAMEROTA: When she says, Lieutenant Governor Duncan, please do the right thing, what's your response to her? DUNCAN: Well, I don't think there's anything more powerful than somebody's mother making an appeal. I'm a father of three boys and I look at so many of these situations that continue to arise through the lens of being a father. I mean, how do I answer the questions for my own kids as to how does this happen? What's the remedy to this?
And so House bill 426 is a bill that came over from the House, over to the Senate, and over the last four or five weeks, I've decided to try to become a subject matter expert. I've asked a lot of questions and brought in members of the African-American community, members of the Democratic Party into my office and asked them, what's the best way to move forward? And quite honestly, I think we can do better than House bill 426.
I've been told by an African-American gentlemen sitting in my office that House bill 426, if passed, would be the weakest hate crimes law in the country, and quite honestly, that's not good enough.
[07:25:03]
This past Sunday, we were sitting online watching church and our pastor made a comment. He said, it's not enough to not be racist. We've got to be anti-racism. As I look forward to the next 11 days to craft hate crimes bill that will make Georgia the worst place to commit a hate crime and the best place to love your neighbor. That's the goal we've got over the next 11 legislative days.
I call on my senators in the Senate and in the House to approve the legislation and get it to the governor's desk.
CAMEROTA: So you supportive a hate crime law and you believe in the space of two weeks, you're going to be able to get it done?
DUNCAN: I do. I think we're continuing to build a consensus all across the Senate. I hope to have a bipartisan effort with support from both parties, as we move forward, because, think about it, the mechanics of a hate crimes bill have to be just more than words on a page.
As we analyze this, we need to make sure that we include things like data collection, uniform reporting, we need to make sure that there's an opportunity, potentially for civil recourse. We also have got to make sure that we have the opportunity to, instead of just having a sentence enhancement and have it as sole discretion of the prosecutor, that we actually give the victim to have the opportunity to have a separate charge of a hate crime and allow them to be able to make that presentation in a court case, in a courtroom.
Those are things that I think we can bring together. It's a big ask, I got you. But I'm up for the challenge and I'm ready to lead this effort.
CAMEROTA: Do you think Ahmaud Arbery's Murder was a hate crime?
DUNCAN: Well, certainly, as the data and the facts continue to roll in. But I think one of the most alarming things of this was the way it was handled, even after the incident itself happened. To have to wait months and to watch the process not work, that's troubling also.
And so I think if we can train law enforcement and prosecutors to understand what is a hate crime, what are the right questions to ask, what's the right training to build an investigation around a hate crime? That to me is the way to make this thing continue to trend in a positive direction.
CAMEROTA: But, I mean, yes or no, as of what you know right now, do you believe that Ahmaud Arbery's murder was a hate crime?
DUNCAN: It certainly appears to be a bias-motivated crime, at least from the messaging, but I've not watched the tapes. I've not read the file. My job is to make sure that we put 11 million Georgians in the best possible position each and every day, when they go to work, when they go to church, when they go to school, when they play in their neighborhoods.
It's important for me to make sure that all 11 million Georgians don't fear for any sort of hate crime or bias-motivated crime.
CAMEROTA: Lieutenant Governor Duncan, thank you. We really appreciate you coming on this morning.
DUNCAN: Absolutely. Thank you for the opportunity.
CAMEROTA: The Minneapolis City Council is talking about dismantling their police department, as you know. We find out what that could look like from a city that has already done it successfully, next.

Meng Announces $1.6 Million in Federal Funds to Help Queens Jewish Facilities Improve Security",FALSE,"Rep. Grace Meng, D-New York, issued the following news release:
U.S. Rep. Grace Meng (D-Queens), a member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, announced today that $1.6 million in federal funding for security improvements has been awarded to 16 Jewish facilities throughout Queens, along with funds for two Christian facilities.
The funds are allocated through the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Nonprofit Security Grant Program, the initiative that provides houses of worship and nonprofit entities with funding to protect their properties against threats and attacks. The grants, which are administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), cover target-hardening and other physical security enhancements such as barriers, gates, safety gear, surveillance equipment, and other safety measures.
Each Queens facility receiving funds, which consist of synagogues and educational institutions, was awarded the maximum grant amount of $100,000. They include the following:
* Reform Temple of Forest Hills
* $100,000
* Young Israel of Hillcrest
* $100,000
* Rabbinical Seminary of America in Kew Gardens Hills
* $100,000
* Young Israel of Queens Valley in Kew Gardens Hills
* $100,000
* Torah Center of Hillcrest
* $100,000
* Forest Hills Jewish Center
* $100,000
* Jewish Center of Forest Hills West in Middle Village
* $100,000
* Shaarey Bnos Chayil Institute in Kew Gardens Hills
* $100,000
* Congregation Ohr Menachem in Forest Hills
* $100,000
* Utopia Jewish Center in Fresh Meadows
* $100,000
* Young Israel of Kew Gardens Hills
* $100,000
* Touro College in Forest Hills
* $100,000
* United Talmudical Seminary in Glendale
* $100,000
* Jewish Institute of Queens in Elmhurst
* $100,000
* Bais Yaakov Academy for Girls in Kew Gardens
* $100,000
* Yeshiva of Central Queens in Kew Gardens Hills
* $100,000
""Following the increase in hate crimes and anti-Semitic incidents, it is vital that Jewish facilities have the resources they need to protect themselves, and these critical funds will be a huge help in guarding against attacks here in Queens,"" said Meng. ""For years, I have worked to expand funding and awareness of these grants, and after last December's horrifying attack in Monsey, I urged more local facilities to apply. Many did so and I'm pleased to have worked with several of them to help secure this money. We cannot let our guard down for a moment. Safety and security must continue to be the number one priority, and I remain committed to doing everything possible to ensure that Jewish facilities are protected from those who seek to do harm.""
The grant awards come after Meng held a workshop in Queens this past January that helped houses of worship and nonprofits in the borough learn about the Nonprofit Security Grant Program, and how they could successfully apply for funding. The Congresswoman hosted the event in Kew Gardens prior to this year's application deadline which was in March.
As a member of the House Appropriations Committee - the panel that funds all U.S. government agencies, programs, and projects, including the Nonprofit Security Grant Program - Meng has helped to increase funding of the grants over the last several years, boosting the initiative to a record $90 million for current fiscal year 2020.
Meng also announced grants for the following non-Jewish facilities:
* Our Lady of the Blessed Sacrament Catholic Academy in Bayside
* $57,000
* Church on the Hill in Flushing
* $61,004

(AP) — Nicole Hylton-Patterson moved to the Adirondack Mountains to help make this vast, and overwhelmingly white, region more welcoming to people who, like her, are Black.
The job has not been easy.
While the death of George Floyd gave her mission a jolt of urgency, the “Go Back to Africa” graffiti on a bridge near her home spoke to her challenges. With relatively few Black people here, white people fill out Black Lives Matter rallies and host online antiracism forums.
Without diverse city streets filled with demonstrators, how do you encourage racial reckonings in rural areas like the Adirondacks, where most everyone looks similar?
“I’ve lived in enough spaces in America to tell people, ’America doesn’t look like New York City, it doesn’t look like L.A. and it doesn’t even look like Atlanta. It looks like the Adirondack Park,” said Hylton-Patterson, who became the first director of the Adirondack Diversity Initiative late last year. “It is more challenging, exponentially so. But the work still has to get done.”
The Adirondack Park covers 6 million acres of thick woods, remote lakes and commanding peaks in northern New York. More than 100,000 people live here year round, many who work in prisons, health care or tourism. White people comprise 95% of the population in some parts of the Adirondacks.
Since her arrival from the Bronx in December, Hylton-Patterson said, she has encountered only a few dozen other people of color.
That uniformity is also seen along the backwoods trails and waterways popular with hikers, skiers and paddlers. Advocates see the need for welcoming more diverse residents and visitors not only as a societal good, but as necessary to a tourism-dependent region that is losing population.
The Adirondack Diversity Initiative had been an all-volunteer effort until a $250,000 state grant allowed it to hire Hylton-Patterson, a veteran in the field. She visits police agencies to make sure officers will receive racial bias training; meets with school administrators interested in making classrooms more inclusive; and works with state environmental officials who want to make the wilderness welcoming.
She settled in the postcard-pretty village of Saranac Lake and began listening to people. Pandemic restrictions sidetracked some plans, though Floyd's death at the hands of the police in Minneapolis made people more receptive to conversations.
“There are a lot of people who are like, ’Yeah, I wish there wasn’t racism, but I’m nice to everyone,’” said Jane Haugh, a white woman who runs the Wake the North Country, an anti-bigotry and criminal justice reform group. “And then George Floyd happened. And suddenly people were calling me and saying, ‘Jane, you’ve been talking about this for so long. Can I come talk to you?’”
Two things that happened locally this summer prompted conversations of their own.
A widely shared video of the Saranac Lake High School graduation featured valedictorian Francine Newman giving a speech about being called “Squinty Eyes,” “Ling Ling” and worse while growing up in a place where the recorded Asian population is nearly zero.
“Ignorance is bliss only for those who did not realize the utter shame and humiliation I carried over a part of myself I would never be able to change,” Newman said.
The other episode hit home for Hylton-Patterson. She was so rattled by the graffiti on a railroad bridge along her daily running route that she moved elsewhere in the Adirondacks. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the vandalism is being investigated by the state’s Hate Crimes Task Force.
Hylton-Patterson is used to living in white areas, noting that as a child she lived on a remote island in Norway. And she’s used to the everyday racism she has encountered here, like being watched while shopping or a woman touching her hair and asking if it’s a wig.
But the graffiti made her feel unsafe.
She still stays in the public eye, hosting videos with themes like “Antiracism 101.” She took a prominent role in pressing for an investigation into an off-duty police officer who fired his gun after an encounter with Black youths. Activists greeted an initial victory this month when state police said the probe was reopened.
And the graffiti galvanized supporters, who posted hundreds of anti-racism flyers around the village.
But a big issue remains in reaching people who wouldn't think of watching an antiracism video, people who think race relations are a city problem. Some locals think confrontations like the suffocation death of Daniel Prude a few hours west in Rochester cannot happen here.
“All I can do is work with your neighbors and hopefully your neighbors will find an opportunity, a gateway to speak to you about engaging in something that might shake the foundations of who you think you are,"" she said.
She plans to provide cultural consciousness and related training for as many as 100 residents who can talk to neighbors in their corner of the Adirondacks. She also is working to identify liaisons with local governments, police departments and school boards to address systemic racism.
In both cases, neighbors would work with neighbors.
“Doing this work in what is a very rural white area, we can’t put all of the pressure on Nicky to teach us and guide us,” said Chris Morris, a longtime ADI volunteer. “It is really incumbent on people who want to help to be actively learning and listening and then figuring out how they can make a difference."""

Misogynists are targeting women more during the pandemic than they did earlier. Why? We women are in a much-weakened position. The pandemic has killed more women's jobs than men's, and has made working from home much more difficult because of lack of child care and doing most of the domestic workload.

As dusk arrives earlier and earlier, I am less free to walk around my neighbourhood after work (in a home office) where there have been several violent attacks on women outdoors. Domestic violence - attacks on women and children in the home - is increasing and shelters are becoming full.
We women can't do it alone. Look at how hard it is to be a woman in politics, fearing physical violence and crude insults just for having been born female.
And then there is another more sinister question. Do women still exist? The word ""women"" is vanishing. This week, a male New York Times reporter wrote about gay men having children. This was his first sentence: ""While plenty of New Yorkers have formed families by gestational surrogacy, they almost certainly worked with carriers living elsewhere.""
Pregnancy is now ""gestational surrogacy."" A pregnant woman is not human; she is a ""carrier."" The word ""woman"" is not used until near the end when feminist Gloria Steinem, 86, is mentioned.
Normally I would not write about a dull American paper's use of language. It's not of interest to Canadians; there are more elegant papers to quote. But it's a huge mainstream paper and its sexist prose gradually smokes into general conversation, in the same way that Trumpish attitudes to women headed north.
In the liberal Guardian this week, a female reporter wrote about a rape survivor, Georgina Fallows, being unable to wear a face mask because it immediately brought back the terror of being raped by a man whose hand was over her mouth. Traumatized, she finds herself abused in public for going unmasked.
The story does not mention ""women"" even once. If the intent is not to exclude male rape victims who can't wear face masks, it is not clear there are any because victims' sex or gender go unmentioned. Yet rape is a current and present danger for all women, smaller and weaker than their rapists. Rape is so rarely prosecuted that Britain has almost decriminalized it.
And now this. With women enduring every disadvantage already, we ""women"" and ""girls"" are vanishing from English speech. It bodes ill for women's rights.

The Adirondack Park covers 6 million acres of thick woods, remote lakes and commanding peaks in northern New York. More than 100,000 people live here year round, many who work in prisons, health care or tourism. White people comprise 95% of the population in some parts of the Adirondacks.
Since her arrival from the Bronx in December, Hylton-Patterson said, she has encountered only a few dozen other people of colour.
That uniformity is also seen along the backwoods trails and waterways popular with hikers, skiers and paddlers. Advocates see the need for welcoming more diverse residents and visitors not only as a societal good, but as necessary to a tourism-dependent region that is losing population.

A17","Heather Mallick Toronto Star OPINION",NA,"Women facing a firestorm of vicious hate",FALSE,"""Can I speak with Catherine?"" The man asking that question then began shouting obscenities at the office of Infrastructure and Communities Minister Catherine McKenna. It was a blizzard of violent and foul language. At one point, the man, filming himself, called her a ""c-t.""
One of the eeriest things? He called her by her first name, part of a social media campaign to demean her. He felt he had that right. She is not a minister of the Crown, she is his.
McKenna once had that word sprayed in red across her Ottawa constituency office. She has had to ask Rebel Media to not refer to her as ""climate Barbie."" And Laura Dudas, an Ottawa city councillor who has faced constant sexualized insults, last week had rocks thrown through the window of her home.
Attacks on politicians, particularly females, are ""accelerating,"" McKenna told the CBC, ""and I think that a lot of what we've seen happen south of the border comes up here, and it is exacerbated by social media."" The police are launching a hate crime investigation and that sounds about right.
Good men are supporting women when foul attacks like this take place in an increasingly toxic and violent atmosphere poisoned by the Trump era. Other men don't. NDP MP Charlie Angus recently said Margaret Trudeau is nothing more than a famous surname. The virulent Maxime Bernier said she has accomplished nothing in life beyond marriage and childbirth.
Misogynists are targeting women more during the pandemic than they did earlier. Why? We women are in a much-weakened position. The pandemic has killed more women's jobs than men's, and has made working from home much more difficult because of lack of child care and doing most of the domestic workload.
One despairs. Good men back feminism; without them, women can't win. We team up. Feminism helped bring more women into the workforce but when will they win power in the workplace? If we measure power by money, men have more. I suspect they will always have more until more men come to support equal rights.
As dusk arrives earlier and earlier, I am less free to walk around my neighbourhood after work (in a home office) where there have been several violent attacks on women outdoors. Domestic violence - attacks on women and children in the home - is increasing and shelters are becoming full.
We women can't do it alone. Look at how hard it is to be a woman in politics, fearing physical violence and crude insults just for having been born female.
And then there is another more sinister question. Do women still exist? The word ""women"" is vanishing. This week, a male New York Times reporter wrote about gay men having children. This was his first sentence: ""While plenty of New Yorkers have formed families by gestational surrogacy, they almost certainly worked with carriers living elsewhere.""
Pregnancy is now ""gestational surrogacy."" A pregnant woman is not human; she is a ""carrier."" The word ""woman"" is not used until near the end when feminist Gloria Steinem, 86, is mentioned.
Normally I would not write about a dull American paper's use of language. It's not of interest to Canadians; there are more elegant papers to quote. But it's a huge mainstream paper and its sexist prose gradually smokes into general conversation, in the same way that Trumpish attitudes to women headed north.
In the liberal Guardian this week, a female reporter wrote about a rape survivor, Georgina Fallows, being unable to wear a face mask because it immediately brought back the terror of being raped by a man whose hand was over her mouth. Traumatized, she finds herself abused in public for going unmasked.
The story does not mention ""women"" even once. If the intent is not to exclude male rape victims who can't wear face masks, it is not clear there are any because victims' sex or gender go unmentioned. Yet rape is a current and present danger for all women, smaller and weaker than their rapists. Rape is so rarely prosecuted that Britain has almost decriminalized it.
And now this. With women enduring every disadvantage already, we ""women"" and ""girls"" are vanishing from English speech. It bodes ill for women's rights.

Unveils Narrow Policing Bill in Senate as House Prepares for Duel",FALSE,"Republicans proposed incentives for state and local police departments to change their tactics as Democrats pushed for a sweeping overhaul.
WASHINGTON -- Republicans and Democrats in Congress moved forward on Wednesday with vastly different proposals for addressing systemic racism in law enforcement, setting up an election-year clash amid growing public support for changing policing in the United States. 
 Senate Republicans unveiled a narrow set of changes that would encourage state and local police departments to carry out reforms, including by restricting the use of chokeholds and penalizing departments that do not require the use of body cameras. Republicans also proposed creating new de-escalation training for officers and better systems for tracking misconduct.
 Introduced by Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, the sole black Republican in the chamber, their bill would not mandate any anti-bias measures, instead proposing the creation of a museum curriculum to educate law enforcement personnel about the history of racism and improving race relations between the police and the communities they serve.
 Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, announced the Senate would take up the bill, called the Justice Act, next week. It was a swift timeline that reflected a sense of urgency to act.
 ''The witnessing of the murder of George Floyd, and the experience in my hometown of Breonna Taylor, certainly brings to the forefront this issue for all Americans, including Senate Republicans,'' Mr. McConnell said. ''I want you to know that we're serious about making a law here.''
 But Democrats dismissed the measure as meaningless. Across the Capitol in the House, they pressed forward with a more far-reaching overhaul that would revamp how police officers operate and make it easier to hold them legally accountable for misconduct, putting in place new anti-discrimination measures and strict limits on the excessive use of force, which Republicans have already rejected.
 The full House is set to vote next week on its measure, which the Judiciary Committee approved on Wednesday in a 24-to-14 vote along party lines. The actions on both sides of Capitol Hill demonstrated the wide gulf that lawmakers would have to bridge to reach an agreement just months before Election Day on what both sides agree is an exceedingly complicated and sensitive set of issues.
 Emphasizing the stakes and the fraught nature of the topic, Republicans and Democrats sparred openly on Wednesday even before either measure had reached the floor.
 Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Democrat, who is white, implored his colleagues not to waste ''this singular opportunity'' with ''a token, halfhearted approach.'' Mr. Scott, who vented his anger last week at being called a ''token'' in his party on issues of race, took to the floor angrily to respond.
 His voice quavering, he noted that Mr. Durbin's comment came on the fifth anniversary of the massacre by a white supremacist of nine black parishioners praying at Mother Emanuel A.M.E. in his hometown, Charleston. Mr. Dubin's remark ''hurts the soul,'' Mr. Scott said.
 Mr. Scott warned that if the two sides resorted to political point-scoring, nothing would get done. ''More people in communities of color will have less confidence in the institutions of power and authority in this nation because we missed the moment,'' he said.
 Emily Hampsten, a spokeswoman for Mr. Durbin, said the senator had immediately offered a private apology to Mr. Scott after the Republican's floor speech. The comment had been aimed at Mr. McConnell, who Mr. Durbin feared would squelch real debate on the measure and deprive Democrats of the chance to make changes, Ms. Hampsten said.
 Not long after, a tense argument broke out in the House Judiciary Committee as Representative Cedric L. Richmond, Democrat of Louisiana, who is black, told Republicans on the panel, all of whom are white, that they were ''making a mockery of the pain that exists in my community'' by trying to add measures unrelated to racism in policing to the bill.
 That prompted an irate retort from Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, who demanded whether Mr. Richmond was assuming that none of the Republicans on the panel had nonwhite children.
 Mr. Gaetz later said in an interview that he had raised a nonwhite child as his own for the last six years.
 Vitriol aside, lawmakers in both parties were facing difficult choices about how to move forward.
 Democratic senators must decide whether to allow the Republican bill to advance and risk giving Republicans political cover on an issue that has placed them on the defensive. Or Democrats can reject the measure and hold out for more robust reforms, opening themselves to criticism for blocking action.
 Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, said he had not decided how to proceed. But he said Mr. Scott's bill would ''not stop us from living this nightmarish cycle,'' urging Republicans to take more assertive steps. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, indicated that Democrats would try to negotiate for more in the Senate, but did not rule out using Senate rules to block Republicans' plan.
 Mr. McConnell dared Democrats to allow a debate.
 ''If they want to make a law and not just try to make a point,'' he said, ''hopefully they'll join us in getting on the bill and trying to move forward.''
 But his comments also underscored the dilemma facing Republicans. While they have tried to show a willingness to meet a moment of national reflection on race -- rushing to put together a bill to change policing for the first time in years and speaking in unusually candid terms about racism in the country -- they are opposed to the federal mandates and legal changes that civil rights activists say are necessary to confront systemic bias in policing. They are also staring down a grim political terrain five months before an election, with Democrats feeling more confident of their chances and positioned to use the issue to score political points.
 Mr. Scott's legislation was ultimately the product of negotiations between Republicans in the Senate, the House, the Justice Department and the White House. House Republicans, who were initially drafting their own proposal, now plan to introduce only Mr. Scott's bill as their own counterpoint. Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Wednesday that the legislation had the administration's full support.
 Across the Capitol in the House Judiciary Committee, the discussion was a mirror image during an 11-hour debate over the Democrats' bill, which would ban the use of chokeholds and other neck-pressure tactics, incentivize new officer anti-bias training and require that lethal force be used only as a last resort. It would also eliminate the qualified immunity doctrine, which shields police officers from being held legally liable for damages sought by citizens whose constitutional rights are found to have been violated.
 The outcome was not in doubt: Democrats had the votes to put the panel's stamp of approval on the package and plan to pass it though the House as early as next week. But the panel's debate foreshadowed what was to come as the two parties tried to reconcile their proposals.
 Republicans, for instance, showed deep unease around qualified immunity, proposing alternative means to narrow protections for officers in certain cases but not eliminate it altogether. They said the change was necessary to protect small departments from expensive, frivolous lawsuits.
 Representative Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, said the legislation included ''provisions that will have a net negative impact on communities that are most affected by crime and on the safety of officers who put their lives on the line to serve them.''
 But Republicans also sought to deflect from the proposal at hand, accusing Democrats of backing efforts to defund police departments, which their bill does not do, and proposing new requirements that the F.B.I. record all interviews, such as the ones they conducted while investigating the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. Republicans also proposed a federal study of whether to declare Antifa a domestic terrorism organization, which prompted Mr. Richmond's outburst.
 Mr. Scott has made clear that he believes eliminating qualified immunity, a proposal rejected by the White House, would amount to a ''poison pill,'' though a small group of Senate Republicans, led by Senator Mike Braun of Indiana, is working with Democrats to introduce a measure in the coming days that would do just that.
 Mr. Scott's bill instead incentivizes local police departments through grant programs to carry out de-escalation and bystander training for their officers. It does not place an outright ban on chokeholds, but like the Democrats' bill, it would condition state and local police departments' access to federal funds on restricting that practice. But the Republican plan contains a much narrower definition, which applies only to an action meant to incapacitate a person. Democrats would ban any maneuver by the police that hindered breathing or blocked an airway.
 Mr. Scott acknowledged his bill's limitations but argued that it amounted to a significant step forward, referencing conversations he has had in recent days with the families of black Americans who were recently killed by the police. Both bills would also designate lynching a federal hate crime for the first time.
 ''Does it take it to the level that every family member wants it to? I think the answer is probably not,'' Mr. Scott said. ''Does it get us much closer? According to the words I heard from family members in both meetings, the answer is yes.''

White gatekeepers in media, art and entertainment have long excluded or misrepresented Latinos, particularly Indigenous and Black Latinos, building the cultural scaffolding for the current administration. To defang these old falsehoods, we have to go after their enablers, transform media and cultural power structures and amplify and defend Latino storytellers. We must flex our power as a community.
 Representative Joaquin Castro of Texas gave voice to this in a recent column for Variety: ''There is a dangerous nexus between the racist political rhetoric and the negative images of Latinos as criminals and invaders that Americans see on their screens.'' Mr. Castro added, ''Hollywood needs to reckon with its systemic injustice and exclusion of our communities.''
 Indeed, all media and culture industries must be held accountable, along with the advertisers, investors and funders who bankroll their behavior.
 In Spanish, we say that ''la cultura cura'' -- culture heals. But the U.S. culture industry, which creates seductive images that reverberate around the world, is a key culprit in Latino stereotyping. Latinos buy more movie tickets per capita than any other group, but of 1,200 top-grossing films from 2007 to 2018, Latinos made up only 3 percent of the lead or co-lead actors (and we are 19 percent of the population).
 When we are onscreen, we're usually depicted in narrow ways. A 2019 Opportunity Agenda report found that 25 percent of Latino immigrant TV characters were portrayed as employed, while 88 percent were represented as incarcerated or the perpetrators of crime. Without alternative stories about regular shmegular Latinos, Mr. Trump's narratives sell to an audience primed by ''Narcos'' on Netflix.
 White elites cannot muffle a huge, vibrant community for decades and not expect consequences. For Latinos in the Trump era, these consequences are deadly, from Hurricane Maria to the Walmart shooting in El Paso and the pandemic, as well as soaring hate crimes.
 Latino artists and organizers are leading the way. In book publishing, 3 percent of employees in 2018 were Latino, a statistic that helps explain why the industry was surprised when Latinos were outraged by the stereotypes in the novel ''American Dirt.'' The author-led Dignidad Literaria movement and Latinx in Publishing are organizing to demand that the industry tell Latino stories, and tell them well.
 Protests by Chicano activists when Disney attempted to trademark the phrase ''Day of the Dead,'' played a major role in making the movie ''Coco'' the culturally astute blockbuster it became. Whether the goal is to shape the movie or shut it down, protests and boycotts coupled with strategic support for alternatives can work.
 Plenty has been written about the toxicity of narco stereotypes, and industry insiders have been organizing against them too. Latinos can learn from Color of Change, which has investigated how TV crime shows misrepresent Black people and campaigned to shut them down, resulting in the demise of the program ''Cops."" Never underestimate the power of bad publicity and people power.
 The facts are as important as the fictions. In the mid-19th century, when white mobs were lynching Mexicans, Spanish-language media covered those murders, leading to public protest and eventual change. Latino journalists from Ruben Salazar (killed by a Los Angeles sheriff's deputy during the Chicano Moratorium 50 years ago) to Juan González, Roberto Lovato, Sonia Nazario, Maria Hinojosa and Tanzina Vega have played herculean roles, but their numbers are small, particularly when it comes to opinion writing.
 This means that we don't set the national agenda, and that too many abuses of our community, from police brutality to wage theft, are never exposed. Organizing inside and outside the newsroom is the primary reason this country's mainstream media has begun to represent the people it covers, as documented in Juan González and Joe Torres's indispensable book ''News for All the People.''
 If a U.S. media outlet today doesn't have several Latino writers, editors and columnists it should be embarrassed and it should be hiring; mastheads must be published and visible; the N.F.L'.s Rooney rule, which requires each football team to interview candidates of color from outside the organization when hiring for major jobs, should be instituted across the industry; bylines, articles, sources and salaries should be scrutinized. Just 13 percent of the Los Angeles Times newsroom is Latino in a city that is almost 50 percent Latino. As a result of organizing by the paper's union and its Latino caucus, the newspaper's owner committed to a 25 percent Latino staff in the next five years.
 The inventory of exclusion is long. Latinos have been shut out of prestige magazines that confer authority, awards and book deals. New York City is about 30 percent Latino -- 2.5 million stories to tell. Yet on its contributor page, The New Yorker magazine does not appear to list a single Latino; the magazine declined to confirm or deny. Because of the publication's union, some newsroom inequalities have recently been addressed. The New Yorker should tackle racial inequalities too, so that excluded groups, including Latinos, particularly nonwhite Latinos, are hired as high-level editors and writers and the magazine can credibly cover Nueva York.
 Funders and investors working to build Latino power must understand that information is essential community infrastructure. They should invest in independent Latino journalism like Futuro Media Group, L.A. Taco, Revista Étnica, Conecta Arizona, 80grados, Radio Ambulante and Latino Rebels instead of bankrolling perennially ''diversifying'' but never ''diverse'' organizations.
 The Mexican-American critic Shea Serrano's one-man media empire is a model. He created a scholarship to support emerging Latino journalists.
 Spanish-language journalism must be supported, too: El Centro de Periodismo Investigativo in Puerto Rico played a pivotal role in bringing down Gov. Ricardo Roselló; imagine if we had an ace Latino investigative shop dissecting Washington. Cultural criticism, watchdog reporting and the opportunity to tell our own stories are crucial to building collective identity and confronting injustice.
 Imagination is essential too. When you sleep with one eye open, it's difficult to dream. That's why our art is a survival strategy. It was on abundant display in Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA, a 2017 citywide series of exhibitions, funded by the Getty Foundation. Getty's support enabled La Raza newspaper and U.C.L.A.'s Chicano Studies Research Center to organize 25,000 images from its archive, offering an electrifying insider view of the 1970s Chicano power movement.
 At the Los Angeles Central Library, the Oaxacan collective Tlacolulokos painted a glorious mural depicting contemporary Indigenous Zapotec culture, supplanting the library's mural from 1933, which showed Native Americans genuflecting to European colonialists. While there were problems with the Getty initiative -- too often it shined a spotlight on white Latin American artists over brown and Black U.S. Latino artists -- it was thrilling in its ambition and scale.
 We need much more: Every major museum should commit to a similar initiative in the next three years, and museum boards and staffs, particularly curatorial teams, should look like the cities they operate in, or forfeit public and private funding.
 Imagine if Hollywood took a cue from Pacific Standard Time: if it made a Oaxacan blockbuster based on the Tlacolulokos murals; an Afro-Dominican futurist fantasy; a drama about the Chicano power movement; a Guatemalan buddy comedy. What if one summer all the blockbusters featured Latino stars, saving cities, planets, people, aliens?
 Pacific Standard Time brought Latino artists and arts organizations from the margins to the center of the Los Angeles art conversation, and demonstrated their dynamism. Let's be clear: Latinos have not been ignored because we are uninteresting.
 But whether they have access to gallery walls or not, Latinos have figured out ways to make their art and find audiences. On Instagram, the riveting @Veteranas_and_Rucas celebrates Los Angeles Latinas with photographs and stories. Its creator, Guadalupe Rosales, has built a community of 257,000 by shining a light on women who are seldom celebrated outside their community.
 Its popularity speaks to the pleasures of reveling in ourselves at a time when our flamboyance feels like a liability. Djali Brown-Cepeda's Nueva Yorkinos does something similar for Latino New Yorkers, telling stories of migration and longing. These foster community, disrupt the country's amnesia about Latinos and demonstrate our thirst to see ourselves. We need to support more self-representation, from podcasts to public art, that do the same.
 All of these efforts are important. But the stories we tell once we have the microphone are critical. Around Latin America, the racial discourse is one of mixing Indigenous, African and European roots, but the most European-featured, light-skinned people usually end up on top, an issue that has resulted in criticism against Spanish-language channels like Univision and Telemundo by organizations like the grass-roots group Mijente.
 The fact that many Latinos, particularly white and light-skinned Latinos, are resistant to talking about how white privilege operates in our own communities means that they silence Indigenous and Afro-Latinos, an internal erasure that reinforces the external one. We must dismantle white supremacy in English and en español, and ensure that Indigenous and Black Latinos are onscreen, behind the camera and running shows and newsrooms.
 In order to reshape cultural power, Latinos must apply pressure from all angles. They should challenge advertisers, a tactic Presente.org and others used to get the anti-Latino Lou Dobbs off CNN. Shareholder activism is another option: by holding at least $2,000 in a public company's stock, one can submit a shareholder proposal expressing concerns about a company's practices for its investors to vote on.
 This could mean investing in media and entertainment companies in order to challenge problematic practices or partnering with investor networks like the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility to shape their priorities around racial justice. For too long, Latinos have been shut out by the corporations that decide how we are portrayed; shareholder strategies have a record of making companies uncomfortable and setting off change. What if we weren't perceived as casualties of culture but as its owners?
 Latinos have been fighting white supremacy since California was part of Mexico. In the past months, 21 percent of Hispanic voters said they had participated in Black Lives Matter protests, for example. From the days of Arturo Schomburg, the pioneering Black Puerto Rican scholar, to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Cesar Chavez's friendship, the Young Lords and the Black Panthers, Black and Latino communities have overlapped -- according to one study, a quarter of Latinos identify as Afro-Latino -- and worked together for justice (of course, there are also Latinos who support Mr. Trump). Today's protests are important, but we also have to deconstruct the cultural context that got us here.
 We are the second-largest ethnic group in this country. Many of us were here before the ancestors of most people who call themselves Americans. Others came as casualties of U.S. colonial experiments, covert operations and trade deals.
 No matter how we got here or when, this country should be grateful for the Latino community: During this pandemic, farmworkers, 80 percent of whom are Latino, have put food on the table for us all, and scores of other Latino workers have propped this country up, often at great cost to themselves.
 The United States must reckon with the fact that Latinos are essential to its survival and to its splendor, and have been for generations. We Latinos need to know it, too.

Unveils Narrow Policing Bill, Setting Up a Clash With Democrats",FALSE,"Republicans proposed incentives for state and local police departments to change their tactics as Democrats pushed for a sweeping overhaul.
WASHINGTON — Republicans and Democrats in Congress moved forward on Wednesday with vastly different proposals for addressing systemic racism in law enforcement, setting up an election-year clash amid growing public support for changing policing in the United States.
Senate Republicans unveiled a narrow set of changes that would encourage state and local police departments to carry out reforms, including by restricting the use of chokeholds and penalizing departments that do not require the use of body cameras. Republicans also proposed creating new de-escalation training for officers and better systems for tracking misconduct.
Introduced by Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, the sole black Republican in the chamber, their bill would not mandate any anti-bias measures, instead proposing the creation of a museum curriculum to educate law enforcement personnel about the history of racism and improving race relations between the police and the communities they serve.
Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, announced the Senate would take up the bill, called the Justice Act, next week. It was a swift timeline that reflected a sense of urgency to act.
“The witnessing of the murder of George Floyd, and the experience in my hometown of Breonna Taylor, certainly brings to the forefront this issue for all Americans, including Senate Republicans,” Mr. McConnell said. “I want you to know that we’re serious about making a law here.”
But Democrats dismissed the measure as meaningless. Across the Capitol in the House, they pressed forward with a more far-reaching overhaul that would revamp how police officers operate and make it easier to hold them legally accountable for misconduct, putting in place new anti-discrimination measures and strict limits on the excessive use of force, which Republicans have already rejected.
The full House is set to vote next week on its measure, which the Judiciary Committee approved on Wednesday in a 24-to-14 vote along party lines. The actions on both sides of Capitol Hill demonstrated the wide gulf that lawmakers would have to bridge to reach an agreement just months before Election Day on what both sides agree is an exceedingly complicated and sensitive set of issues.
Emphasizing the stakes and the fraught nature of the topic, Republicans and Democrats sparred openly on Wednesday even before either measure had reached the floor.
Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Democrat, who is white, implored his colleagues not to waste “this singular opportunity” with “a token, halfhearted approach.” Mr. Scott, who vented his anger last week at being called a “token” in his party on issues of race, took to the floor angrily to respond.
His voice quavering, he noted that Mr. Durbin’s comment came on the fifth anniversary of the massacre by a white supremacist of nine black parishioners praying at Mother Emanuel A.M.E. in his hometown, Charleston. Mr. Dubin’s remark “hurts the soul,” Mr. Scott said.
Mr. Scott warned that if the two sides resorted to political point-scoring, nothing would get done. “More people in communities of color will have less confidence in the institutions of power and authority in this nation because we missed the moment,” he said.
Emily Hampsten, a spokeswoman for Mr. Durbin, said the senator had immediately offered a private apology to Mr. Scott after the Republican’s floor speech. The comment had been aimed at Mr. McConnell, who Mr. Durbin feared would squelch real debate on the measure and deprive Democrats of the chance to make changes, Ms. Hampsten said.
Not long after, a tense argument broke out in the House Judiciary Committee as Representative Cedric L. Richmond, Democrat of Louisiana, who is black, told Republicans on the panel, all of whom are white, that they were “making a mockery of the pain that exists in my community” by trying to add measures unrelated to racism in policing to the bill.
That prompted an irate retort from Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, who demanded whether Mr. Richmond was assuming that none of the Republicans on the panel had nonwhite children.
Mr. Gaetz later said in an interview that he had raised a nonwhite child as his own for the last six years.
Vitriol aside, lawmakers in both parties were facing difficult choices about how to move forward.
Democratic senators must decide whether to allow the Republican bill to advance and risk giving Republicans political cover on an issue that has placed them on the defensive. Or Democrats can reject the measure and hold out for more robust reforms, opening themselves to criticism for blocking action.
Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, said he had not decided how to proceed. But he said Mr. Scott’s bill would “not stop us from living this nightmarish cycle,” urging Republicans to take more assertive steps. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, indicated that Democrats would try to negotiate for more in the Senate, but did not rule out using Senate rules to block Republicans’ plan.
Mr. McConnell dared Democrats to allow a debate.
“If they want to make a law and not just try to make a point,” he said, “hopefully they’ll join us in getting on the bill and trying to move forward.”
But his comments also underscored the dilemma facing Republicans. While they have tried to show a willingness to meet a moment of national reflection on race — rushing to put together a bill to change policing for the first time in years and speaking in unusually candid terms about racism in the country — they are opposed to the federal mandates and legal changes that civil rights activists say are necessary to confront systemic bias in policing. They are also staring down a grim political terrain five months before an election, with Democrats feeling more confident of their chances and positioned to use the issue to score political points.
Mr. Scott’s legislation was ultimately the product of negotiations between Republicans in the Senate, the House, the Justice Department and the White House. House Republicans, who were initially drafting their own proposal, now plan to introduce only Mr. Scott’s bill as their own counterpoint. Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Wednesday that the legislation had the administration&#39;s full support.
Across the Capitol in the House Judiciary Committee, the discussion was a mirror image during an 11-hour debate over the Democrats’ bill, which would ban the use of chokeholds and other neck-pressure tactics, incentivize new officer anti-bias training and require that lethal force be used only as a last resort. It would also eliminate the qualified immunity doctrine, which shields police officers from being held legally liable for damages sought by citizens whose constitutional rights are found to have been violated.
The outcome was not in doubt: Democrats had the votes to put the panel’s stamp of approval on the package and plan to pass it though the House as early as next week. But the panel’s debate foreshadowed what was to come as the two parties tried to reconcile their proposals.
Republicans, for instance, showed deep unease around qualified immunity, proposing alternative means to narrow protections for officers in certain cases but not eliminate it altogether. They said the change was necessary to protect small departments from expensive, frivolous lawsuits.
Representative Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, said the legislation included “provisions that will have a net negative impact on communities that are most affected by crime and on the safety of officers who put their lives on the line to serve them.”
But Republicans also sought to deflect from the proposal at hand, accusing Democrats of backing efforts to defund police departments, which their bill does not do, and proposing new requirements that the F.B.I. record all interviews, such as the ones they conducted while investigating the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia. Republicans also proposed a federal study of whether to declare Antifa a domestic terrorism organization, which prompted Mr. Richmond’s outburst.
Mr. Scott has made clear that he believes eliminating qualified immunity, a proposal rejected by the White House, would amount to a “poison pill,” though a small group of Senate Republicans, led by Senator Mike Braun of Indiana, is working with Democrats to introduce a measure in the coming days that would do just that.
Mr. Scott’s bill instead incentivizes local police departments through grant programs to carry out de-escalation and bystander training for their officers. It does not place an outright ban on chokeholds, but like the Democrats’ bill, it would condition state and local police departments’ access to federal funds on restricting that practice. But the Republican plan contains a much narrower definition, which applies only to an action meant to incapacitate a person. Democrats would ban any maneuver by the police that hindered breathing or blocked an airway.
Mr. Scott acknowledged his bill’s limitations but argued that it amounted to a significant step forward, referencing conversations he has had in recent days with the families of black Americans who were recently killed by the police. Both bills would also designate lynching a federal hate crime for the first time.
“Does it take it to the level that every family member wants it to? I think the answer is probably not,” Mr. Scott said. “Does it get us much closer? According to the words I heard from family members in both meetings, the answer is yes.”

Editor's Note: The China Society for Human Rights Studies on Thursday released an article titled ""The COVID-19 Pandemic Magnifies the Crisis of 'U.S.-Style Human Rights'."" Following is the full text:
The sudden and unexpected outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic is the most serious global public health emergency that humanity has experienced since the end of World War II. It is also a ""big test of human rights conditions"" for all countries across the globe. The virus does not respect borders, nor is race or nationality relevant in the face of the disease. Given this, to honor our common commitment to human rights, governments of different countries are obliged to adopt scientific measures for the prevention and control of the virus and do their best to ensure the health and safety of their people. Nevertheless, the U.S. government's self-interested, short-sighted, inefficient, and irresponsible response to the pandemic has not only caused the tragedy in which about 2 million Americans became infected with the virus and more than 110,000 have died from it, but also caused the exposure and deterioration of the long-existing problems within the United States, such as a divisive society, the polarization between the rich and the poor, racial discrimination, and the inadequate protection of the rights and interests of vulnerable groups. This has led the American people into grave human rights disasters.
1. The U.S. Government's Ineffective Response to the Pandemic Leading to Human Rights Disasters
Being distracted, slack, and opinionated in the face of the pandemic, the United States Federal Government declared a national emergency on March 13, after tens of thousands of deaths had occurred. The pandemic statistics released by Johns Hopkins University in the United States showed that as of June 9 Eastern Standard Time (EST), there had been 1,971,302 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 111,620 deaths from the virus in the United States, with both figures significantly higher than those of other countries. For the United States, which boasts the strongest economic and technological strength and the most abundant medical resources in the world, this is a sad irony.
Ignoring the Pandemic Warnings. According to the revisited timeline of the pandemic in the United States, which was released by The New York Times and Washington Post in April 2020, the U.S. government had repeatedly ignored the pandemic warnings and slacked off on pandemic control. In early January, the National Security Council (NSC) received intelligence reports predicting the spread of the virus in the United States. On January 29, Peter Navarro, Director of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy at the White House, laid out in striking detail the potential risks of a coronavirus pandemic: as many as half a million deaths and trillions of dollars in economic losses. U.S. health officials and medical experts, such as Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services Alex Azar, also repeatedly warned of the deadly pandemic in the United States. Unfortunately, the U.S. government ignored these warnings. Instead, it focused on controlling the spreading of information, restricted medical experts' freedom to release information on the pandemic to the public, and even published false information to mislead the public, such as calling the virus ""a flu"", claiming that the virus has low infection and fatality rates, and saying that ""One day it's like a miracle, it will disappear."" Under such circumstances, the ""golden window"" period for infectious disease prevention and control was wasted. Even then, many members of the U.S. Senate, including Richard Burr, who was the chairman of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, were involved in insider trading scandals. They used their positions to understand the serious situation of the pandemic earlier, but they downplayed the risk of the pandemic in front of the public while selling a large number of stocks before the pandemic triggered a stock market crash. In this way, they had a ""perfect hedge"".
Prioritizing Capital Interests. The website of The New York Times reported on April 13, 2020, that the White House COVID-19 Response Working Group and the NSC jointly prepared a memo dated February 14, which was titled ""U.S. Government Response to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus."" According to the report, the memo documented drastic pandemic-control measures including: ""significantly limiting public gatherings and cancellation of almost all sporting events, performances, and public and private meetings that cannot be convened by phone. Consider school closures."" Nevertheless, the decision-makers immediately rejected the memo after hearing that the measures would lead to the collapse of the U.S. stock market. This showed how the U.S. government prioritized capital interests and the response of the capital market, rather than making the people's right to life and health a priority. Due to this, the U.S. government failed to give effective warnings to the public and failed to get prepared for the potential consumption of medical resources caused by the pandemic, bringing the American people to the brink of infection and death.
Politicizing the Anti-pandemic Endeavor. When the virus broke out in the United States, some U.S. politicians used it as a weapon to attack political opponents and seek election benefits instead of regarding the drive to protect the lives and health of their people as their top priority. The website of The Lancet, an authoritative medical journal, published an editorial on May 16, which was a rare case for the journal. The editorial explicitly pointed out the intervention of political parties in the public health sector of the United States, and the weakening role of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It criticized the U.S. government for not actively adopting basic medical and anti-pandemic measures such as detection, tracking, and isolation, placing its hopes on ""magic bullets"" such as vaccines and new drugs, and hoping that the virus would eventually ""magically disappear"". On May 4, the famous U.S.political scientist Francis Fukuyama published the article The Wages of American Political Decay on the website The National Interest, pointing out that the highly polarized party politics made the political checks and balances an insurmountable obstacle to decision-making; that the pandemic, which should have been an opportunity to put aside differences and show unity, further deepened the political polarization. Politicians viewed the pandemic as an opportunity to seize power and partisan interests, and this came at the cost of the lives of countless American people.
Leading to Catastrophic Consequences. The website of The New York Times reported on May 20, 2020, that research by Columbia University of the United States showed that delays in adopting movement restrictions had caused at least 36,000 people to die. According to the research, if the U.S. government had adopted movement restrictions one week earlier, it could have saved 36,000 lives, and if the U.S. government had adopted movement restrictions two weeks earlier, 83 percent of the deaths from COVID-19 could have been avoided. On May 24, The New York Times unprecedentedly dedicated its entire front page to 1,000 U.S. COVID-19 victims. Their names, ages, and brief descriptions were listed under the headline ""U.S. Deaths Near 100,000, an Incalculable Loss,"" with a subheadline reading: ""They Were Not Simply Names on a List. They Were Us."" The website of the Time reported on May 20 that the delayed social-distancing measures caused 90 percent of the deaths from COVID-19 in the United States, and observed that such a huge loss of life was essentially a failure of U.S. democracy.
2. Inequality within U.S. Society Being Fully Exposed during the Pandemic
In the United States, both liberal and conservative scholars agree on one basic fact that there is stark inequality within U.S. society. The deep-seated institutional reason for such inequality is that the U.S. government and political parties have long been manipulated by interest groups, and are unable to formulate and implement tax, industrial, and social security policies that promote social equality. During the pandemic, the social and economic inequality within U.S. society has been exposed and exacerbated.
The Elite Class of the United States Being Specially Treated in Coronavirus Testing. Viral infection does not distinguish between rich and poor, but the limited testing and medical resources were not fairly allocated in the United States. The website of The New York Times reported on March 19, 2020, that many dignitaries in the United States somehow underwent virus testing when they had no signs of infection and when nearly every state in the country lacked testing equipment. Uche Blackstock, an emergency medicine physician, said frustratedly, ""As a physician, I find it upsetting that celebrities and government officials without symptoms have been able to access testing quickly with same-day results, while I've had to ration out testing to my patients with turnaround times of five or seven days."" This obvious injustice has made the public increasingly raise questions. When medical staff and many patients cannot be diagnosed, whether the privileged class obtains priority testing means that the ordinary people are deprived of testing opportunities. The website of The Guardian, a British newspaper, published an article on March 21 and commented that when the Titanic hit the iceberg and sank, women and children were protected and rescued first, but in the face of COVID-19, the United States has first rescued the rich and powerful groups. The gap between rich and poor in getting the virus tests in the United States has exposed the slackness, confusion, and injustice in its pandemic prevention and control system.
People at the Bottom of U.S.Society Facing an Increasingly Dangerous Situation. The pandemic has made the lives of people at the bottom of U.S. society increasingly difficult, and further intensified the social polarization between rich and poor. According to a CBS report in 2019, nearly 40 percent of Americans would struggle to cover a $400 emergency expense, and 25 percent of Americans skipped necessary medical care because they could not afford the cost. The website of The Atlantic reported in April 2020 that low-income people in the United States would usually delay seeing a doctor when they became ill, not because they did not want to recover, but because they had no money at all. Faced with the COVID-19 pandemic, tens of millions of people in the United States are not covered by medical insurance, when intensive care for COVID-19 costs as high as tens of thousands of dollars in the country. ""To be or not to be"" is not just a philosophical proposition of some literary work, but a realistic choice that the people at the bottom of U.S. society have to make. Russia Today reported on April 30 that a Gallup survey revealed that one in seven American adults said that if they or their family members developed symptoms related to COVID-19, they would probably give up medical treatment because they were worried that they could not afford the costs. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, pointed out on April 16 that the poor in the United States were ""being hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic"". He observed, ""Low-income and poor people face far higher risks from the coronavirus due to chronic neglect and discrimination, and a muddled, corporate-driven federal response has failed them.""
High Unemployment Rates Leading the Working Class into a Crisis of Survival. According to data released by the U.S. Department of Labor on May 28, 2020, the cumulative number of Americans applying for unemployment relief from March 15 to May 23 has for the first time reached 40.8 million. Given the high unemployment rate brought about by the pandemic and the long-existing structural discrimination and polarization between rich and poor, the U.S. working class's ability to resist risks has greatly diminished. Vox News reported on April 10 that from the catering industry and tourism to the media industry, the entire U.S. economy has felt the impact of the pandemic, and just like the impact of other crises, the most vulnerable groups bore the brunt of the economic impact. According to the report, during the pandemic, the people who are most vulnerable amid layoffs are those who earn the lowest salaries, such as low-wage workers in the catering and retail industries. According to the report released by the National Restaurant Association on April 20, two-thirds of restaurant workers (about 8 million people) have been dismissed or put on vacation due to the pandemic. When the U.S. government launched the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which was intended to help small-and medium-sized enterprises, some large companies with sufficient funds took advantage of the rule loopholes to acquire huge loans, but small businesses and small shops that urgently needed loans to sustain themselves could not get the help. The above-mentioned report also showed that at least 60 percent of employers said that the existing relief plan of the federal government could not help them reduce layoffs. All this has revealed that the U.S. working class was the first to feel the pain of the economic recession brought about by the pandemic, and became the victims of the U.S. government's inefficient anti-pandemic measures.
3. Racial Discrimination Being Intensified within the United States during the Pandemic
The systemic racial discrimination is a chronic illness of U.S. society. Since 2016, white supremacy has revived and racial discrimination has intensified in the United States. Social tensions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, especially the unequal allocation of limited anti-pandemic resources, have further deepened mainstream society's discrimination against minorities, such as Asian, African, and Hispanic Americans.
Asian Americans Suffering from Stigmatization. The website of The Guardian, a British newspaper, pointed out on April 1, 2020 that stereotyping of Asian Americans still happens in the United States, and when reporting on the COVID-19 situation, some U.S. media always attach photos of Asian faces. The website of The New York Times observed on April 16 that the COVID-19 pandemic meant isolation for Asian Americans. Since the outbreak of the virus, Asian Americans have often been humiliated and even attacked in public places. Some U.S.politicians even deliberately misled the public. After the World Health Organization officially named the new coronavirus ""COVID-19"", senior U.S. leaders, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, still insisted on referring to the virus as the ""Chinese virus"" or ""Wuhan virus"". They also refused to correct that mistake even after being strongly criticized by the international community. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, Tendayi Achiume, pointed out on March 23 and April 21 that politicians of relevant countries proactively expressed xenophobic opinions or made xenophobic implications by deliberately replacing COVID-19 with other names that linked this particular disease to a particular country or nation, which was an irresponsible and disturbing expression. The current pandemic-related discrimination has fully exposed the once-concealed racial prejudice. In the United States, which bills itself as the ""beacon of freedom"", government officials blatantly incite, guide, and condone racial discrimination, which is tantamount to humiliating the modern concept of human rights.
African and Hispanic Americans Falling Victims to Severe Racial Inequality. Racial discrimination is deeply rooted in the history and reality of the United States. The COVID-19 pandemic has put this issue underneath a magnifying glass and tragically exposed its negative consequences. African Americans across the country are infected with and die from COVID-19 at a disproportionately higher rate than any other group in the United States. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) released a racial breakdown of the state's confirmed COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 deaths on April 2, 2020, which showed that African Americans, who make up only 12 percent of Michigan's population, accounted for 33 percent of Michigan's confirmed COVID-19 cases and 40 percent of the state's COVID-19 deaths. National statistics released by the CDC showed that as of May 13, African Americans accounted for 22.4 percent of deaths from COVID-19 in the United States. This percentage is significantly higher than the African Americans'12.5 percent share of the total U.S.population. African Americans in Kansas, Illinois, and Missouri accounted for only 5.7 percent, 14.1 percent, and 11.6 percent of the total population of the states, respectively, but accounted for 29.7 percent, 30.3 percent, and 35.1 percent of these states' deaths from COVID-19.Hispanic Americans also have disproportionately higher infection and fatality rates during the pandemic. In early April, New York City released a racial breakdown of the city's deaths from COVID-19.According to it, Hispanic Americans accounted for 34 percent of the city's fatal cases of COVID-19. The website of The New York Times pointed out on April 14 that the fact the pandemic infected and killed African and Hispanic Americans at disproportionately higher rates was the result of a health gap directly created by the historical inequality of wealth and opportunities. The website of the Financial Times, a British newspaper, pointed out on May 15 that African Americans and Hispanic Americans were more likely than whites to perform the work that was necessary for the maintenance of social operations, making them more susceptible to poverty, diabetes, high blood pressure, and COVID-19. The report also pointed out that this pandemic exacerbated the racial differences in the United States, and that nothing could better display the difference in skin color in the United States than the life and death stories in the pandemic shutdown. On May 25, George Floyd, an African-American man from Minnesota, died after a white police officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for several minutes during his arrest. This led to large-scale protests and demonstrations across the United States, once again exposing the dissatisfaction and anger that the American people have for the worsening racial inequality.
Frequent Racist Violence. During the pandemic, racist violence has haunted the United States, and Asian Americans suffer from venomous personal attacks. From March 19 to April 1, 2020, alone, the U.S. nonprofit organization ""Stop AAPI Hate ""received more than 1,100 reports of hate incidents. In February 2020, a 16-year-old Asian boy in Los Angeles was accused of being a ""virus carrier"" and viciously beaten at school. On March 14, in a supermarket in Midland, Texas, a 19-year-old man deliberately stabbed an Asian man and his two young children with a knife on the ground that ""they were Chinese and were spreading the novel coronavirus to others."" On April 5, an Asian woman in Brooklyn, New York City, was attacked by a racist who spilled unidentified chemical liquid on her to severely burn her upper body, face, and hands when she was emptying rubbish at her door. Violent incidents have further exacerbated the social tension during the pandemic, and problems such as a divisive society, racial divide, and the proliferation of guns have worsened. On April 15, nearly 200 U.S. foreign policy scholars and former diplomats jointly issued a statement in USA Today, pointing out that hate crimes and violent attacks against Asian Americans sounded the alarm for the United States, and that leaders at all levels and in all sectors should take action to oppose racism against Asians and end hate crimes against Asian communities.
4. Vulnerable Groups in the United States Struggling to Survive during the Pandemic
The care for the survival of socially disadvantaged and marginalized groups represents the virtue of a society. It is also a touchstone for the human rights situation in a country. During the pandemic, the features of the United States' cruel capitalism have been fully exposed, which have forced the elderly, homeless people, and children into a tragic situation.
The Elderly, the ""Victims"" of the Government's Ineffectiveness in Fighting the Pandemic. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has repeatedly stressed that the elderly, like young people, have the same rights to life and health amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and no person is expendable. Unfortunately, during the epidemic in the United States, the elderly group, which is naturally at greater risk, has been further weakened and marginalized due to age discrimination, and the elderly's right to life has not been ensured. On March 23 and April 22,2020, Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick expressed in interviews with Fox News that he would rather die than see public health measures damage the U.S. economy and take the risk of restarting the U.S. economy at the cost of elderly people's lives. Ben Shapiro, the editor-in-chief of The Daily Wire, which is a right-wing U.S. media outlet, declared coldly on an interview show on April 29, ""If somebody who is 81 dies of COVID-19, that is not the same thing as somebody who is 30 dying of COVID-19."" He also said, ""If grandma dies in a nursing home at age 81, and that's tragic and that's terrible, also the life expectancy in the United States is 80."" The website of The New York Times reported on May 11 that at least 28,100 occupants and staff members of long-term care institutions such as nursing homes in the United States have died of COVID-19, accounting for about one-third of COVID-19 deaths in the United States. In these care institutions, many elderly people live in a relatively closed environment, so their risk of death from COVID-19 infection is very high. The website of The Atlantic published two articles respectively on March 28 and April 29, titled Ageism Is Making the Pandemic Worse and We're Literally Killing Elders Now. They pointed out that long-existing defects in the old-age care system, such as insufficient capital investment and staffing, caused the United States to fall behind in ensuring the rights and interests of the elderly, and that such a situation was due to many political reasons. The website of the Washington Post observed on May 9 that the U.S. anti-pandemic action had become a state-approved massacre that deliberately sacrificed the lives of the elderly, the working class, African Americans, and Hispanic Americans.
The Homeless Having Nowhere to Go during the Pandemic. The website of USA Today reported on April 22, 2020, that more than 550,000 people were homeless every night in the United States. The report also pointed out that according to the statistics released by the Homeless Alliance, about 17 out of every 10,000 Americans have experienced homelessness and about 33 percent of them are families with children. Many of the homeless Americans are elderly people and disabled people. Given their originally poor physical health and bad living and hygienic conditions, they are susceptible to the virus. During the epidemic, the homeless who are living on the streets are deported and forced to live in temporary shelters for isolation. The website of Reuters reported on April 23 that the crowded shelters made it impossible for the homeless who lived there to maintain social distance, which made it easier for the virus to spread. As of April 20, 43 homeless people living in New York City's shelters had died from infection of COVID-19, and 617 tested positive for COVID-19.The website of The New York Times reported on April 13 that the shelters for the homeless had become a delayed-action bomb of a virus outbreak in New York City, where more than 17,000 people lived and slept almost side by side in centralized shelters. The website of Nature journal reported on May 7 that when researchers began conducting virus testing on homeless people in the United States, they found that the situation there had gotten out of control. The website of the Boston Globe reported on May 4 that 596 homeless people in Boston had been diagnosed with COVID-19, accounting for one-third of the confirmed cases in the region.
The website of the Los Angeles Times reported on May 14 that research showed that due to the impact of the pandemic, the number of homeless people in the United States might surge by as much as 45 percent within a year, further exacerbating the public health crisis.
Worrisome Situation of Poor Children and Immigrant Children. The United States has not yet ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which is one of the core international human rights conventions. In recent years, child poverty and abuse has remained a grave problem in the United States. This problem has been exacerbated by the pandemic. Forbes News reported on May 7, 2020 that a survey showed a large number of American children were facing hunger during the pandemic. As of the end of April, more than one-fifth of American households had been facing food crises, and two-fifths of American households with children under 12 years of age have been facing such crises. Forbes News reported on May 9 that the number of child exploitation reports in the United States surged during the pandemic. The National Center for Missing &Exploited Children received 4.2 million reports in April, an increase of 2 million from March 2020 and an increase of nearly 3 million from April 2019. Apart from that, a more worrisome fact is that a large number of unaccompanied immigrant children are still being held in detention centers in the United States. They are currently in an extremely dangerous situation during the pandemic. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on human rights of migrants Felipe Gonzalez Morales and other UN human rights experts issued a joint statement on April 27, requesting the U.S. government to transfer immigrants from overcrowded and insanitary detention centers. On May 29, 15 experts of the Special Procedures of United Nations Human Rights Council issued a joint statement urging the United States to take more measures to prevent virus outbreaks in the detention centers. The website of the United Nations reported on May 21 that since March, the U.S. government had repatriated at least 1,000 unaccompanied immigrant children to Central and South America regardless of the risk of the pandemic. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) criticized this move, for it would expose the children to greater danger.
5. Relevant Behaviors of the U.S. Government Seriously Violating the Spirit of International Human Rights Law
When the citizens' right to life and health is severely threatened by the spreading pandemic, the U.S. government, instead of focusing on controlling the pandemic, wields a hegemonic stick and fans the flames of trouble everywhere, trying to divert attention and shirk responsibility. Its behaviors have seriously undermined the international community's concerted efforts to control the pandemic.
Ineffective Anti-pandemic Efforts Failing the National Duty of Ensuring the Citizens' Right to Life. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) stipulates that every human being has the inherent right to life, and countries are obliged to take proactive measures to guarantee their citizens' right to life. As a party to the convention, the U.S.government, however, has not given priority to its citizens' right to life and health during the pandemic. Instead, it has been prioritizing the political campaign at home and the political drive to suppress China abroad, rather than safeguarding the lives and safety of its citizens. Given this, it has missed the best chance to curb the spread of the virus, and caused a grave human rights disaster in which about 2 million people have been infected with COVID-19, and more than 110,000 have died from the virus. Clearly, the U.S. government has failed to fulfill its due national obligations to protect its people's lives from the threat of epidemics. The website of The Independent, a British newspaper, commented on April 10, 2020, that the United States, an active advocator for human rights, ignored its own human rights obligations and blatantly overlooked its citizens' lives. The website of the Huffington Post reported on May 6 that after making a rigorous assessment of the U.S. government's poor performance during the COVID-19 pandemic, Yale University epidemiologist Gregg Gonsalves directly pointed out that this was getting awfully close to genocide by default.
Maliciously Stigmatizing China in Violation of the Principles of Equality and Non-discrimination. The principles of equality and nondiscrimination are the core norms of international human rights laws and are confirmed by a series of international human rights instruments, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Since the outbreak of the virus, high-ranking U.S. government officials have violently disregarded human conscience and ethical bottom lines. To maintain the U.S. hegemony, these officials have politicized the pandemic and constantly stigmatized China by referring to the virus as the ""Wuhan Virus"" or the ""China virus"".When the scientific community came to the conclusion that the exact source of the virus was from nature, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo still repeatedly claimed that the virus came from some lab in Wuhan according to some ""intelligence reports"" he read. These politicians' behaviors have clearly violated World Health Organization Best Practices for the Naming of New Human Infectious Diseases, which was jointly issued by the World Health Organization, the World Organization for Animal Health, and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 2015. The way they refer to the virus goes against the World Health Organization's suggestion for the official name of the novel coronavirus disease. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, Tendayi Achiume, pointed out on March 23 that some U.S. government officials refused to use the internationally-recognized name of the virus and deliberately replaced it with other names that linked this particular disease to a particular country or nation, which was an irresponsible and disturbing expression that came from and would give rise to racism, xenophobia, stigmatization, and exclusion of certain groups, and violence against certain groups. She held that such behaviors were unforgivable and incompatible with the obligations stipulated by the international human rights laws.
Suspending the Payment of WHO Membership Fees Impeding the Joint Anti-Pandemic Efforts of the International Community. In order to shirk its responsibility for its disastrous anti-pandemic measures, the U.S. government tried to scapegoat the World Health Organization by fabricating false charges against the organization and threatening to stop paying its membership fees. On April 14, 2020, the U.S. government announced its suspension of paying dues to the WHO, which was unanimously criticized by the international community. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued a statement on April 14 stating that when the world was fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, it was inappropriate to reduce the resources required by the WHO or any other humanitarian organization for operations. The President of the American Medical Association, Patrice Harris, issued a statement on April 15 stating that combating the pandemic required international cooperation and that the suspension of financial support to the WHO at this critical moment is a dangerous step in the wrong direction. Josep Borrell, the European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, expressed on April 15 that at this time, there was no reason to justify such an action. On April 15, the website of The Guardian, a British newspaper, published an editorial and commented that when the world desperately needed to jointly overcome this threat that the world had never experienced before, the suspension of the WHO dues by the U.S.government was an act that lacked morality and disrupted the international order, and was a horrible betrayal to global solidarity. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on April 16 that the WHO was the mainstay of the global fight against the pandemic, and the suspension of the WHO dues by the United States at this time ""would be nothing other than throwing the pilot out of the plane in mid-flight"".Under such circumstances, the U.S.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo once again attacked the WHO on April 22, threatening to permanently suspend the payment of dues. On May 29, the president of the United States announced the suspension of relations with the WHO.
Unilateral Sanctions Violating the Spirit of Humanitarianism and the Principle of International Cooperation. International cooperation is the cornerstone of the existence and operation of the international community. It is an important principle for ensuring the implementation of human rights and fundamental freedoms across the globe. It is also a national obligation stipulated by international instruments, such as the Charter of the United Nations. At this critical moment when the deadly pandemic spreads globally and threatens human life, health, and well-being, all countries should work together to respond to the pandemic and maintain global public health security. Nevertheless, during this pandemic, the U.S. government has still imposed sanctions on countries such as Iran, Cuba, and Venezuela, which made it difficult for the sanctioned countries to obtain needed anti-pandemic medical supplies in a timely manner, and posed threats to the people's rights to life and health in the sanctioned countries. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, expressed on March 24, 2020, that in the case of a global pandemic, sanctions would hinder medical work and increase risks for everyone. She argued that to maintain global public health security and protect the rights and lives of millions of people in sanctioned countries, sanctions should be relaxed or suspended in certain sectors. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, the Special Rapporteur on human rights for safe drinking water and sanitation, and the Special Rapporteur on the right to education issued a joint statement on May 6 stating that the U.S. sanctions on Venezuela were seriously harming the human rights of the people in the country. They urged the United States to immediately lift sanctions that exacerbated the suffering of the people when the pandemic raged in the country.

But the claim that Kass's column is anti-Semitic—""The odious, anti-Semitic conspiracy theory[4] that billionaire George Soros is a puppet master controlling America's big cities does not deserve a mainstream voice, especially at a time when hate crimes are rising""—strikes me as quite unfounded.George Soros is trying to play a major role in American political life; according to the New York Magazine[5] (Gabriel Debenedetti) story ""Ranking the Most Influential Democratic Donors in the 2020 Race,"" George Soros was #3 on the list, right behind Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer. 
People can praise him for that, or can criticize him, just as the Kochs on the right and other such spenders are criticized by people they disagree with. I have nothing against rich people spend money to support speech they like, but it's perfectly legitimate to fault them for promoting what the author thinks are bad ideas.Nor does this seem to be some sort of cherry-picking of a Jewish donor just because he's Jewish. He is indeed a major and long-standing funder of left-wing causes; his role in funding causes he believes in is widely reported in mainstream media outlets, see, e.g., this recent Bloomberg[6] story about his plan to ""Invest $220 Million in U.S. Equality Groups,"" and this recent Washington Post[7] op-ed on his ""trying to change the system that made him rich."" Soros is genuinely a big player here, and thus rightly a big target for those who disagree with him. (For whatever it's worth, as best I can tell, of the 8 top Democratic donors included on the New York Magazine list, 7 are Jewish, and the one exception, Tom Steyer, is half-Jewish, though a practicing Christian.) We Jews shouldn't be specially criticized because we are Jewish, but we also aren't entitled to special immunity from criticism because we are Jewish.Kass's response is here[8]. David Bernstein took a somewhat different approach in this 2018 post[9], though I read David's point there as focused on lies and distortions about Soros rather than criticisms generally (such as Kass's).

It tells the story of a historic performance at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham more than 50 years after a hate crime there killed four African American girls. An initiative called Violins of Hope contributed painstakingly restored musical instruments to the event, including violins recovered from Holocaust concentration camps, symbols of resilience in the face of hate, discrimination and racism. Musicians and artists, including some from UAB, performed and contributed to the creation of the concert and documentary.
The full list of awards for ""Dreams of Hope"" includes:

""Dreams of Hope"" blends concert performance footage with behind-the-scenes interviews chronicling the event's preparation and reflecting on its significance. Concert footage features the premiere of ""Dreams of Hope for Solo Violin & Orchestra"" by acclaimed composer and conductor Panion, commissioned especially for this concert. Alongside the Dreams of Hope Orchestra, the concert features vocalists Valerie Smith and Lenora Goodman-Panion, dancer Kelsey Ebersold, and the Miles College Choir. Presented and distributed by American Public Television, it has had more than 300 separate broadcast airings on public television stations nationwide since its premiere in February and has been highlighted during both Black History Month and Jewish Holocaust Remembrance holidays.
""It has been amazing to see how so many people across the nation have embraced our film,"" Panion said. ""To have it receive multiple encore airings in markets such as Los Angeles, New York and Chicago is just remarkable. 'Dreams of Hope' will air for the first time in Minneapolis on Father's Day of this year.
Mayor of the City of Birmingham Randall Woodfin described the film as ""a powerful testimony of inclusion, unity and hope for a generation of leaders. It is my desire that this message of love, empathy, compassion and triumph will be embraced there and throughout the world in these most-troubled times.""
A note to Panion from the Telly Awards announcement stated ""Now more than ever, we are thrilled to recognize creators like you who are bringing high-caliber stories to our screens. Once again, congratulations on being named a Gold Telly Award Winner!""
Panion teaches music theory and technology in the College of Arts and Sciences' Department of Music. He is best known for his work as conductor and arranger for superstar Stevie Wonder, for whose performances and recordings he has led many of the world's most notable orchestras. The two-CD set ""Natural Wonder"" features Panion conducting his arrangements of many of Wonder's award-winning, chart-topping songs with Wonder and the Tokyo Philharmonic. He owns the studio Audiostate 55 Entertainment.
""To be recognized alongside organizations such as HBO, NBC, Disney, Universal, the History Channel and Viacom is remarkable,"" Panion said. ""And to learn that our single film has won more (awards) than many entire networks have won is simply mind-blowing. I am grateful to the Violins of Hope Birmingham Committee for having been given this opportunity to produce 'Dreams of Hope.'

We're going to be breaking down big headlines again. Good to see you. Thanks for joining us.
LOU DOBBS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Good evening, everybody. Carnage in our streets and the radical left rages on against America and Americans.
In the first six months of this year, murders in the United States have increased more than 20 percent from last year. The murder rate in some of our nation's largest cities has risen multiples of the national rate.
Democrat city governments seem to be not only appeasing anarchists and the left activists, but permitting runaway street violence. Murders in Cincinnati up 77 percent, Denver 48 percent, Minneapolis 47 percent, Louisville 45 percent, Nashville a 43 percent increase in murders and murders are up 39 percent in Kansas City, 36 percent in New Orleans, 39 percent in Chicago, 32 percent in Houston, 27 percent in New York City, and murder rates in most of those cities are only rising higher.
Each of those 10 cities run by a Democrat mayor. But rather than focus their outrage on the failed Democratic leadership of this country, the leftwing national media peddles the fiction that responsibility lies elsewhere, somehow with the President, law enforcement, and the remedy is to allow anarchist, Black Lives Matter activists and leftist activists to destroy our national heritage and defund, of course, our police departments.
Philadelphia murders have increased 23 percent through June and rather than demand more policing in Philadelphia, Black Lives Matter seeks the total abolition of the Philadelphia Police force within the next five years.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
YAHNE NDGO, BLACK LIVES MATTER, PHILADELPHIA: One of the things that we're demanding is defunding over five years to the complete abolition. So, we don't want to see any police in our community in over the course of those five years, and the five years gives time for the community to begin to build what is needed instead of police, so that we are not looking to leave any kind of a vacancy around the issue of safety.
Quite often, if there is violence happening by the time the police arrive, that has already, you know, occurred and particularly in neighborhoods, like, you know, poor neighborhoods and in black and brown communities.
So the police is not really a resource for preventing that kind of crime from happening, they're just a response.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
DOBBS: Well, just north of the White House, D.C. has dedicated two blocks to Black Lives Matter. Never mind that protesters have violently clashed with police, tried to tear down statues and have done so in many cases and has also set fire to and vandalized St. John's Episcopal Church.
Last night, eight people arrested in the area known as now Black Lives Matter Plaza. So, much for peaceful demonstrations.
One Black Lives Matter protester attacked another black man for supporting President Trump.
[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]
DOBBS: Well, there is a Bill of Rights, just apparently the left doesn't make it still operational.
D.C. isn't the only city to pay tribute to Black Lives Matter with murals in the streets. At least 19 other cities have done so as well. And for what reason?
It's a decision that hasn't gone over well with some of the citizens of those cities and towns. In Martinez, California, a couple spent their Fourth of July painting over a 165 foot Black Lives Matter mural on a city street, Marxist art, if you will.
Now those two have been charged by the Contra Costa County District Attorney with a hate crime. They're painting over a mural receiving greater condemnation from the left that has painted obscenities on national monuments, torn down statues commemorating Americans like Frederick Douglass, Ulysses S. Grant, and abolitionists.
The left's selective outrage evident also in how it has responded to NFL quarterback, Drew Brees, who during an interview last month said he disagreed with those who would disrespect the American flag. He said he would stand for the National Anthem, and he had to apologize for such radical expressions.
Activist athletes from the sports world denounced Brees, forcing him to apologize. This Monday, Eagles wide receiver DeSean Jackson took to social media to post anti-Semitic hate speech attributed to Hitler and praising anti-Semite, Louis Farrakhan.
What was the reaction from the left and all of those outraged professional athletes? Nary a word. To the radical left, standing for the flag is a much greater sin than being an anti-Semite.
Another member of the radical left, no stranger to hate speech is Minnesota Congresswoman, Ilhan Omar. For her, defunding the police is not enough. Absolutely insufficient. Now, she is now calling for a full-fledged dismantling of the American political system.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. ILHAN OMAR (D-MN): We can't stop at Criminal Justice Reform or policing reform for that matter. We are not merely fighting to tear down the systems of oppression in the criminal justice system. We are fighting to tear down systems of oppression that exists in housing, in education, in healthcare, in employment, in the air, we believe.
As long as our economy and political systems prioritize profit without considering who is profiting, who is being shut out, we will perpetuate this inequality.
So we cannot stop a criminal justice system. We must begin the work of dismantling the whole system of oppression wherever we find it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
DOBBS: Oppression that produces a congressman like Ilhan Omar for example.
As the radical left tries to tear down the very foundation of the country, the Supreme Court today gave President Trump another victory, a major victory.
The court ruled seven to two, allowing employers to refuse on religious grounds to cover contraceptives under Obamacare. Over the past few weeks, the Supreme Court has sided with the President on a number of major issues including speedy deportations, border wall funding, the Electoral College and rights for religious schools.
President Trump today welcomed Mexico's President, Andres Manuel Lopez- Obrador to the White House. The President hailed the relationship between the United States and Mexico, and he said it has never been better.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The relationship between the United States and Mexico has never been closer than it is right now. And as the President said a little while ago, people were betting against that. They were actually betting against that.
But it's never been stronger, never been closer. We're doing tremendous job together. We're cherished friends, partners and neighbors. Our cooperation is founded on mutual trust and mutual respect between the two of us and between our two countries, and we honor the great dignity of both nations.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
DOBBS: Our first guest has been in attendance at the meetings between President Trump and Mexican President Lopez-Obrador. Joining us tonight is the National Security Adviser, Robert O'Brien.
Robert, it's great to have you with us and this is an extraordinary moment. Give us a sense of how those talks have gone on, at first, if you will, just the atmosphere and the tone between these two men.
ROBERT O'BRIEN, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: Well, thank you for having me on, Lou. It's a very warm day here in Washington and the warmth here outside the White House is matched by the warmth inside between the two Presidents.
The meetings have been extraordinarily cordial between the Presidents and the two delegations. We're making a lot of progress on various issues.
But President Lopez-Obrador and President Trump have really hit it off. You could see that earlier when they were in the Rose Garden together. And it's -- we have a great relationship with Mexico, as the President said, it's never been better.
And what a fantastic visit by the President. I know you talked about monuments earlier. One of the nice things is that President Lopez-Obrador earlier this morning went out to the Lincoln Memorial and placed a wreath in front of Abraham Lincoln. What a gesture of friendship and respect from a socialist President down in Mexico to come up and honor President Lincoln that way. We were very pleased to see that.
DOBBS: And he and the President share something else. It's not often given much attention and at least, the leftwing media and that is both men, our populace and believe strongly in their responsibilities to the people rather than, if you will the commercial interest of their respective nations, even though both are pursuing better times for all as a result of their efforts to get more people employed.
One of the things that most people have ignored here, Robert, as you know, is that these two men are operating as partners as we have never seen in all of the time that I have been covering both Mexico and the United States, and that goes back to Salinas and the first Bush era.
This is an extraordinary thing. And by the way, I frankly am astonished that the White House Communications Department, the Trump administration, the Trump campaign doesn't make more of the fact that these two men are operating as co equals in battling the cartels, drugs and building a new trade relationship.
O'BRIEN: No, a hundred percent, Lou, and you said they had something in common. I thought you were going to say they both like baseball. So when they exchanged gifts earlier today and it's a custom when a head of state comes out and bring a gift for the President and the President returns the gift.
They exchanged baseball bats today so the President signed and gave a custom Louisville Slugger to President Lopez-Obrador. President Lopez- Obrador gave the President a beautiful bat that had been manufactured by some indigenous people in Southern Mexico, and they're both baseball fans as well.
So, yes, look, you're right about the partnership. I mean, nobody thought this would be possible that President Lopez-Obrador said this. He said, people wouldn't believe this.
But when you look at what President Trump has done, he has built the wall, immigration is down dramatically. Now part of that is because of the wall, part of it is also because the Mexicans have deployed 27,000 troops to their border.
And why have they done that? Look, they don't want human traffickers on their border. They don't want narco traffickers on their border. They don't want the illegal immigrants from conflict zones on their border, and so we've got a lot in common with Mexico.
And of course, a lot of folks in the media would ignore that. But President Lopez-Obrador and President Trump are working together as partners, and I don't think we've ever had a better relationship, as you just mentioned and you've been following this for a long time, Lou.
DOBBS: Indeed, and it's nice of you to point that out, Robert. The fact of the matter is --
O'BRIEN: Since you were 12.
DOBBS: If we look at what is -- God bless you for bailing me out. The fact of the matter is that both countries have an immense investment in one another. The fundamental idea behind NAFTA, when it was first created, and I was there for that moment as well and series of moments.
It was that the United States felt that if we were to enrich anyone, we should be enriching our neighbors first. That is Canada, and of course, Mexico, and that is precisely what has happened.
Now, this is a more mature relationship and the President is bringing greater balance and Lopez-Obrador is working to ensure that the cartels meet their appropriate fate.
Has there been much discussion about those cartels and what both countries can do to rid this hemisphere of them?
O'BRIEN: Well, cartels aren't just in Mexico and with respect to Mexico, Bill Barr, our Attorney General has been down to Mexico City a couple of times in the last several months, and Mexico has begun ever since those terrible murders of the American family in Mexico.
They've extradited a number of cartel figures to the United States, have been cooperating closely with the D.O.J., with Attorney General Barr.
The other thing that we're doing, which Mexico truly appreciates is the President deployed Naval and Coast Guard assets and soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines to the Eastern Pacific down near Baja, California and the Caribbean, and we're interdicting tons and tons and tons and tons of cocaine and marijuana, well over $2 billion of street value of drugs that we've interdicted over the past three or four months.
Some of those drugs were actually going to Mexico. So, we're doing a favor to the Mexicans, but to ourselves as well, and stopping those drugs are coming in primarily from Venezuela.
So, again, that's another area of partnership between the U.S. and Mexico, it is interdicting drugs coming from the narco regime in Venezuela.
DOBBS: Any new initiatives between the two leaders that you can tell us about this evening?
O'BRIEN: Well, I think one of the things that we've been doing, I'm not sure it's new, but a lot of people don't know about it, and Mexico has been hit hard with COVID. We've been hit hard with COVID.
And President Lopez-Obrador has been very grateful to President Trump for the support that we've given our southern neighbor on the COVID crisis. We've sent out, I think over 600 ventilators, to Mexico to help with their ICU capacity and both countries are sharing knowledge that they're gaining regarding the COVID virus.
So we're working to come out of COVID, which came from China. It hit the whole Western Hemisphere and we're working together to come out of that COVID crisis and strengthen both the Mexican and the American economy.
And again, we're blessed to have neighbors of like Canada and Mexico and have a great integrated market here in the Western Hemisphere and as we move our supply chain home from China, Mexico and Canada will play a big role in that, so it's important to us.
DOBBS: Ambassador Robert O'Brien, always good to see you. Thanks for being with us.
Turning now to Wall Street, stocks rebounding after yesterday's selloff with a gain. The Dow up 177 points, the S&P up 25, and the NASDAQ hitting a new record close, up 149 points on the day, the 25th record close of this year. Volume on the big board picking up to five billion shares.
Crude oil, settling at $40.86 a barrel.
And retailer Brooks Brothers filing for bankruptcy because of the impact of the China virus. The retailer closing 51 stores as it seeks a potential buyer. Brooks Brothers has 500 stores worldwide.

Up next, Goldman Sachs with a dark forecast of what to expect if Joe Biden were to be the unthinkable -- that is elected. R.N.C. Chair Ronna McDaniel joins us here next. Stay with us. Ronna, I'm sorry about that. Ronna McDaniel, next. Stay with us.
DOBBS: Breaking news now. Anti-Trumper and former National Security Council member, Alexander Vindman retiring from the U.S. Army, never being promoted to full Colonel. Defense Secretary Mark Esper supported his promotion, the President did not.
Vindman was a key witness, if you can call him that -- that was the intention at least in the radical Dems sham impeachment effort last year.
During the hearings, Vindman's supervisor the National Security Council, Tim Morrison expressed frustration at Vindman's dismissal of the chain of command. Vindman reported his concerns with a call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelensky to the National Security Council's attorney rather than his superior, and he had only a tepid influence on the whole farcical proceeding.
Radical Dem Tammy Duckworth had given President Trump an ultimatum to either promote Vindman to full Colonel or she would block the promotions of more than a thousand senior Army officers. We know what happens when you give leaders ultimatums.
Meanwhile, Duckworth and other radical Dems have been utterly silent after a top general in the Middle East, Frank McKenzie, the head of CENTCOMM says no American troops died from the reported and, by the way, unconfirmed Russian bounties to the Taliban in Afghanistan.
The corrupt World Health Organization now supporting China's handling of an outbreak of the bubonic plague saying there's no cause for alarm and that the communist government is doing just a buff job. They'll soon have to walk this back like everything else they've said about the China virus and the Chinese government and its handling of the cover up in the origin of the China virus.
The W.H.O. you'll remember claimed there was no human to human transmission of the China virus. You'll remember that they also delayed declaring that the China virus had set off a global pandemic, despite the fact that it was obviously a pandemic, and they're now saying they first learned about the virus from the internet, not from Chinese communist government officials.
Secretary of State Pompeo says the W.H.O. pattern of corruption is why the United States has been withdrawn from the W.H.O. by President Trump.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Don't forget that this is an institution that got it wrong on SARS. They got it wrong on Ebola. The United States had to create its own system, PEPFAR to do the work to prevent and come up with solutions to the HIV-AIDS problem. We did that. The United States did that.
The World Health Organization has a long history of corruption and politicization.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
DOBBS: Well, breaking news now. A republican PAC is spending $2 million to air an ad in Wisconsin on Joe Biden's history of lying.
The Restoration PAC focusing on Biden lying about his education and his 1988 presidential campaign. Biden claimed he had three degrees, had a full scholarship to law school and graduated at the top of his class, not so.
Biden will also hurt the economy says none other than, Goldman Sachs, hardly a bastion of Republicanism. A Goldman Sachs report says that the Biden tax plan would cut S&P 500 earnings by $20.00 a share. That is not good.
Joining us tonight is Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel. Ronna, great to have you with us. And I really -- I have to say, Goldman Sachs has just handed you in the Republican Party and the President an immense gift for your advertising against Joe Biden.
$20.00 a share is a significant, significant down move for any market, it would be disastrous. Your reaction?
RONNA MCDANIEL, CHAIRWOMAN, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE: Well, I think Goldman Sachs is right. And I think the market recognizes this and the American people should recognize Biden would be a disaster for our economy.
He's never held a job outside of Washington. He's never started a business. He has no clue what he is doing. He will bankrupt this country. He has already talked about the fact that he would raise taxes, get rid of our energy independence, sign on to the Green New Deal.
Today, he said he would direct funds away from the police. He would be an unmitigated disaster for this country, and Americans will be poorer for his leadership, if he does get elected, which we're going to stop, Lou, because we're going to reelect President Trump.
DOBBS: You need to get ahold of Kanye West. He got really confused in one of his latest pronouncements saying that President Trump was in a bunker. It was a little confusing. He's going sort of the way of Joe Biden.
It's Biden, who spends all of his time in the basement, a bunker in his home, not the President of the United States who is in front of the American people up close and personal more than any President in modern history.
MCDANIEL: Absolutely, I mean, Biden is hidden. He's not taking tough questions from the press. That is his whole campaign strategy. The less you get to know me, the better I'll do.
I'm so excited for these debates. I cannot wait for them to go toe to toe. And of course the President has not only led through this pandemic by getting the PPE and the ventilators and the testing ramped up, he put our economy in an unprecedented position before this.
He is going to lead us back from this, but he is also showing the path forward. We can be healthy and safe. But we can also open up our economy and start working again and campaigning again because we have to start moving forward, and Biden is stuck in his basement, shivering in fear.
DOBBS: Ronna, if you would, stay with us through this quick commercial break. We've got a hard break coming at us. I want to continue with a few issues with Mitch McConnell and the Republican Party.
Ronna McDaniel on the other side of these commercials. Please stay with us.
DOBBS: We're back with the Chair of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel.
And Ronna, let me ask you this. You've got a lot of several campaigns, whether it's the Tuberville sessions, the contest in Alabama, whether it is Collins in Georgia, and Kobach out in Kansas. In most instances, they're leading -- in the case of Sessions just short of leading in their races, and yet they don't have the support of the Republican Party.
They don't have the support of Mitch McConnell. What's going on? And why in the world aren't you supporting winners? That's, I guess, the question. Why is there this confusion in the Republican Party when you need to keep a majority?
MCDANIEL: So the R.N.C. doesn't get involved in primaries, and I think that there's wisdom in that because it allows you to bring the competing parties together.
DOBBS: For crying out loud, Ronna --
MCDANIEL: After a divisive primary.
DOBBS: McConnell is spending $2 million against Kobach. I'm sorry?
MCDANIEL: The R.N.C. -- I mean, the President got involved in Tuberville.
DOBBS: I mean, he is trying to kill the frontrunner in the poll.
MCDANIEL: Yes. Yes, we just stay neutral.
DOBBS: So what's the deal?
MCDANIEL: Because we bring everybody together. It's part of our policy and then we come back together after the primary. We bring them together to get the winner across the finish line.
We want the voters to make the decision, and they will and Mitch has a different philosophy and that's his choice, but we stay neutral in these primaries.
DOBBS: Well, he's got the same philosophy. Tuberville is pro-amnesty. He is on the wrong side of a number of issues. The President has endorsed him nonetheless, but did cancel a campaign rally with him.
Kobach is conservative as he can be. And frankly, he stands pretty tall amidst the field that is arrayed against him, despite McConnell and his RINO money.
I mean, this is just -- the party looks like hell to the American voter doing this stuff.
MCDANIEL: But Lou, if we waste money -- here's the thing, and it's tough, because if we spend money in these primaries, we may not have money for the general and we have to keep the Senate.
So, we've got to focus on who gets through the primary, let the voters decide. The candidates have to raise their own money and run their own race and that's part of vetting the good candidate, getting through, winning these divisive primaries or these competitive primaries, and then we get them across the finish line in the general.
But we have to win the Senate. So, our money has gotten to the ground game. We're in all of these battleground states, the biggest ground that we've ever built, and we're ready to win back this -- keep the Senate, win back the House and reelect the President in November. And that is what our focus is.
And if I'm getting involved in all of these primaries, I will waste resources that will eventually help us keep those goals in mind of winning the House, keeping the Senate and winning the presidency. I wish I had unlimited funds, then I'll get involved in everything.
DOBBS: I wasn't going to ask you to spend money. I was asking you to get ahold of Mitch McConnell's right ear, and kind of twist it.
Ronna, thanks so much. Appreciate it. Great to see you as always. Ronna McDaniel.
Please join us here tomorrow night, a special interview with the Chief of Staff of the White House, Mark Meadows. Hope you'll join us for that.
And coming up, a reminder to preorder my new book ""The Trump Century: How our President Changed the Course of History Forever."" You can preorder a copy at the trumpcentury.com.

Well joining us tonight to take this up, K.T. McFarland, former deputy National Security Adviser to President Trump; Sara Carter, investigative reporter, Fox Business contributor.

K.T. MCFARLAND, FORMER DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER TO PRESIDENT TRUMP: Yes.
DOBBS: We have a Phase 1 Deal that was historic in January in which now is on life support at best, your thoughts about what is going on in the relationship between China and the United States.
MCFARLAND: Well, President Trump isn't backing down. I think this is what's so important for people to realize that the Chinese are trying to use the pandemic. They plan to come out of this in two or three years' time, having supplanted the United States as the dominant superpower in the world.
And one of the ways they're trying to do it is by seizing control of the South China Sea and basically turning the world's most important maritime trade route into an internal Chinese lane. So, they get to decide who sails in the South China Sea or not. That's why it's so important that President Trump has reinforced -- it made the message very clear and sending the two carriers into the South China Sea.
We're not leaving the South China Sea, guys. We're not leaving the Pacific and President Trump continues to stand up to the Chinese, which is so critical right now, especially as we're struggling with a Chinese origin pandemic.
DOBBS: And we're getting almost zero reporting from U.S. sources on the South China Sea, where military exercises are also being undertaken by the PLA, the Chinese Navy. What is that about?
MCFARLAND: Well, they are not -- if this is not a good news story --
DOBBS: K.T., what is that about?
MCFARLAND: Well, I think what that's about is that the mainstream media is not going to talk about it.
DOBBS: It's not a good news story?
MCFARLAND: It's not a good news story for the mainstream media because it is a good news story for Donald Trump. He's standing up to them. They don't want to talk about that. They want to talk about school should never open. Oh, the American economy is in the tank. Oh, this is so horrible.
They don't want to talk about a strong national leader who is standing up for the interest of the United States.
DOBBS: They don't want to talk, Sara, either about the fact that Christopher Steele, the ex-MI6 agent who concocted the Russian collusion dossier, and created all sorts of fiction to the consternation, obviously of everyone who cares about truth being ordered by a British Court now to pay off the businesses that were remarked on in his dossier.
SARA CARTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: That's right, Lou. I mean, I think that was a great segue, you know, going from China to Christopher Steele, because overall, what we're seeing here is a mainstream media that is refusing, like K.T. said, to report the truth.
And what we know now is that in London, Christopher Steele was basically hammered by a Magistrate ordering him to pay over $22,000.00 to each of the defendants involved in the case of his dossier, which has been completely debunked.
You know, Christopher Steele -- it should be even so much more. Because when you think about this, it's not just a piece of paper with a simple lie. This basically put it nation for the last four years -- Christopher Steele, the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton, and everybody involved in this has really created divisiveness in our country.
They lied about General Flynn. He lied about Carter Page. He lied about everybody that was involved in the dossier, and now whether or not Christopher Steele will have to make any kind of statement here in the United States, I mean, he is obviously not going to want to do that. But we know now for certain that this dossier is debunked.
Unfortunately, so many people's lives, including K.T.'s, including General Flynn, everyone else have been turned upside down by these lies.
DOBBS: And not one of the SOBs is in jail, nor does right he or she look like they are headed in that direction. K.T., I want to go back to China.
The amount of money that's being sent by Chinese immigrants back to China without -- mostly untaxed. We're talking billions and billions of dollars. We're talking about Christopher Wray, who says that the F.B.I. doesn't need any help in dealing with the espionage of the Chinese and surveillance of the Chinese and their cyberattacks in this country, all of which have gone without response by the United States, and which is costing us somewhere around a half trillion dollars a year that the Chinese continue to steal.
What in the hell is going on in this government?
MCFARLAND: You know, it's just stunning to me because President Trump is the first guy to have stood up to the Chinese, and he is not backing down. He is not backing down no matter what happens.
And to have the Director of the F.B.I., who I think -- you know, I think he's got a lot to answer for, frankly, on why the Department of Justice and the F.B.I. have not pursued investigating the investigators as they should have done, why the F.B.I. never turned over that exculpatory information to General Flynn.
DOBBS: Yes. I mean, that's one side, but I'm talking about national security here. I'm talking about China. I'm talking about a damn fool sitting before Congress and saying that he does -- he is not worried about a half a trillion dollars in the theft of U.S. intellectual property. He's got plenty of people to take care of that.
MCFARLAND: Well, that's not true.
DOBBS: Meanwhile, the F.B.I. hasn't been able to do a damn thing about cyberattacks or intellectual property.
MCFARLAND: So, you know, this is a really big deal because the next war is not going to necessarily be fought with aircraft carriers and missiles. It's going to be fought in cyberspace and with economic tools, and the Chinese are developing those tools and the intellectual property theft continues.
And for the Director of the F.B.I. to say, oh, that's not much of a big deal. You bet it is a big deal, because, what are they stealing? They're stealing weapon systems. They are stealing weapon designs. R&D, the cost is trillions of dollars, Lou.
DOBBS: Sara --
CARTER: K.T., you know, I just wanted to go right off of what K.T. was saying.
DOBBS: Sara, you get the last word.
CARTER: She is absolutely right. Oh, I was just going to say what K.T. is saying is absolutely right. Research and development or theft of intellectual property, Lou, is something that we have to focus on when it comes to China.
And remember this, China is taking advantage of the chaos now and the divisiveness in our own country. This is what the Dems continue to instigate.
So nations like China and Russia are taking advantage of that and taking advantage of this time to expand their reach in the world, and we have to be able to put a stop to that. It is a national security risk for us and it's something that needs to be investigated.
DOBBS: Yes, and somebody should tell Mark Esper, the head of the Department of Defense that, you know, we do have combat photographers in all of the branches and that if the national media won't cover a carrier taskforce in the South China Sea, then he sure as hell should be doing so.
K.T. McFarland, Sara Carter, thank you both. Appreciate it.
Up next, the radical left waging an all-out war against our government, our institutions, and our democracy. We take that up and more with former Civil Rights activist, Bob Woodson. He's with us. Well, it's Wednesday. He's automatically here.
Stay with us. We'll be right back.
DOBBS: Joe Biden says the police are the enemy. Those are his words, the enemy. In an interview, Biden said quote, ""Surplus military equipment for law enforcement, they don't need that. They have become the enemy. They're supposed to be protecting these people,"" end quote.
Joining us now is Bob Woods, former Civil Rights activist. He headed the National Urban League Department of Criminal Justice. He is the founder of the Woodson Center, which helps residents in low income neighborhoods.
ROBERT WOODSON, FOUNDER, WOODSON CENTER: Good to see you, Lou.
DOBBS: Bob, it's great to see you. Since we last talked a week ago, I mean, things are not getting better. If anything, they're getting worse.
We have Ilhan Omar talking about effectively destroying the American system, the American way of life. We have the Toronto BLM leader talking about whites are subhuman. The list goes on, the violence in the cities and more young people are dead. And we have some of the most ignorant discussions on television imaginable when they talk about tearing down statues and tearing down this country. What is the antidote?
WOODSON: Well, first of all, Lou, it's ridiculous that a Virginia legislator has proposed that we reduce assault on police officers from a felony to a misdemeanor. What is that all about?
We are in a crisis. The very people who are supposed to be social justice warriors are demeaning the police and marginalizing them and as a consequence, is resulting in more black deaths.
We had more black on black murders in the major cities the last Fourth of July weekend than we've ever had in the nation. This is a crisis and they are being destroyed by people who are supposed to be their champions.
But it goes beyond that. I was upset that the KIPP School is a group of charter schools over 25 years to serve 100,000 black kids and they have been an oasis for these families seeking a decent education, and their model used to be hard work and be nice and emphasize academic excellence.
And now they have just concluded they changed it. Their leadership said that those values diminish the significant effort to dismantle systemic racism and places the values on being compliant and submissive and supports the illusion of meritocracy.
This is coming -- that's like some -- people are drowning and they're being saved by people who assault them. They are saviors. So this is where this unraveling of this nation is occurring in the culture. But if it can occur among a very valuable institution, I hope that this leadership will rethink this surrender to the race grievance mob, because that's what it is.
But the solution is to promote resilience, and --
DOBBS: Without question.
WOODSON: But when you deemphasize --
DOBBS: And Corporate America, I want to get your -- I'm sorry. Go ahead.
WOODSON: Yes, yes. No, go ahead, Lou. Corporate America is funding Black Lives Matter. Go ahead. I'm sorry, Lou.
DOBBS: That's exactly where I was -- no, that's exactly what I was going to ask you about. I mean, I can't believe the number of corporate boards that are deciding to give money to a Marxist organization that means to destroy the nuclear family, which you've been talking about as the foundation of those who are in poverty and our inner cities in particular.
It's their foundation for the future, to restore the family to them, which by the way, as you have also pointed out, the history of the African- American in this country at one time was based on a strong nuclear family.
It just stuns me that there's so much ignorance based on ideology in boardrooms and executive suites, as well as, you know, the mobs that are taking our streets.
Bob, I'd like you to comment on that when we return with this quick commercial break. We've got a hard out. If you would deal with that when we return, I'd sure appreciate it and you will appreciate what Bob has to say, I guarantee it. We'll be right back with Bob Woodson.
DOBBS: We're back with Bob Woodson. And Bob, very quickly your thoughts on what can be done to restore the families in our inner cities and in our low income neighborhoods?
WOODSON: We must learn from our past. For a hundred years, black families prospered because of their Christian faith and a nuclear family.
They understood that the best antidote to disrespect is performance and the best response to oppression is resilience. So, there are examples -- contemporary examples of resilience that is reflective of our old values that apply to a new vision.
We must stop funding Black Lives Matter and invest in these indigenous agents that are healing these communities from the inside out and front the bottom up. That's what we must do.
DOBBS: Wonderfully said. Thank you. Thank you so much, Bob. We appreciate it. And I love learning the KIPP, the knowledge is power group.
Work hard and be nice. Those are words for the ages. Thanks so much. We appreciate it. As always, see you next week, Bob.
That's it for us tonight. We thank you for being with us. Tomorrow night. White House Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows joins us.
And my new book, we recommend to you highly, ""The Trump Century: How our President Changed the Course of History Forever."" It's now available for preorder at the trumpcentury.com. That's the trumpcentury.com.
Thanks for being with us. We'll see you here tomorrow. Good night from Sussex."

Adriano Espaillat (D-NY) News Release",FALSE,"NEW YORK, NY - Today, Representative Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) announced support of the Justice in Policing Act, led by members of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC), which would take key steps to achieve transformational, structural change to combat the pattern of police violence:
The Justice in Policing Act aims to remove barriers to prosecuting police misconduct and recovering damages from officers who have violated civilians' rights, including by ending qualified immunity by law enforcement; demilitarize the police by limiting the transfer of military weaponry to state and local police departments; combat police brutality, including by requiring body and dashboard cameras, banning chokeholds, ending the use of no-knock warrants in drug cases and enacting steps to end racial profiling; step up pressure on the Justice Department to address systemic racial discrimination by law enforcement; and, officially make lynching a federal hate crime, as the House did in passing H.R. 35 earlier this year.
""I am proud to stand in unity and solidarity with my Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) colleagues to demand justice and call for an end to the police brutality and targeting of African Americans around the nation,"" said Rep. Adriano Espaillat (NY-13). ""I have long fought for communities of color in my district and will continue my fight for African American and Latino families to ensure all persons are treated equally under the law. Now is the time for systemic and transformational reform of America's policing system, to transition away from a policing-first model. The best anti-crime policies are anti-poverty policies, and we must invest in our communities to foster opportunity. If we fail to act and implement real change, history will judge us by our inaction and failure to ensure life, liberty and justice for all persons in our nation.""
Last week, Rep. Espaillat announced the Harlem Manifesto, a series of legislative policies to urge for the end of police brutality and targeting of African Americans throughout the nation. Additionally, Espaillat introduced the Denial of Rights Prevention and Accountability Act that would hold officers accountable in court for abuses committed under the color of the law, and create a new statute that would lower the mens rea bar from willful deprivation of rights to reckless deprivation of rights, thereby permitting prosecutors to successfully hold law enforcement officers liable for the deprivation of civil rights and liberties.
Espaillat legislative priorities he fought for and prioritized in his Harlem Manifesto that are included in CBC, House Democrats' Justice in Policing Act:
* Denial of Rights Prevention and Accountability Act - Congressman Espaillat introduced this bill, which changes the 18 U.S.C. Sec. 242 mens rea requirement from willfulness to recklessness, permitting prosecutors to successfully hold law enforcement accountable for the deprivation of civil rights and civil liberties.
* Eric Garner Excessive Use of Force Prevention Act - This bill prohibits and makes punishable the use of a chokehold or any maneuvers that restrict the flow of blood or oxygen to the brain.
* Ending Qualified Immunity Act - This bill explicitly states that the judicial theory of qualified immunity is not a defense to liability, ensuring that the courts can't let police officers off the hook for civil charges in cases constitutional violations.
* Police Exercising Absolute Care with Everyone (PEACE) Act - This bill changes the use of force standard for officers to require that force must be necessary, as a last resort, to prevent imminent death or serious bodily injury, and no reasonable alternatives were available.
* Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act - This bill prohibits the Defense Department from transferring military weapons to state and local law enforcement agencies.
* Law Enforcement Trust and Integrity Act - This bill creates accreditation standards to ensure compliance with approved practices and transparency within the community.
* Police CAMERA Act - This bill requires all law enforcement officers to wear body cameras and prohibit the seizure of cell phones or other recording devices used to document police interactions without a person's consent or a warrant.
First elected to Congress in 2016, Rep. Adriano Espaillat is serving his second term in Congress where he serves as a member of the influential U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee, the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and the House Small Business Committee. He serves as a Senior Whip of the House Democratic Caucus and is a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) where he also serves in a leadership role as CHC Whip. He is also chairman of the CHC Task Force for Transportation, Infrastructure and Housing. Rep. Espaillat's Congressional District includes Harlem, East Harlem, northern Manhattan and the north-west Bronx. To find out more about Rep. Espaillat, visit online at https://espaillat.house.gov/.

A Carnegie-Knight News21 investigative report, ""State of Emergency,"" won the prestigious 2020 Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award. It was the fifth RFK Award the Cronkite School has won - the most of any journalism school in the country.
As part of an eight-month investigation, 37 journalism students from the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication and 18 other universities traveled to 25 states, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, conducting hundreds of interviews and reviewing thousands of pages of government documents, data and state and federal statutes for ""State of Emergency.""
The student journalists investigated whether the U.S. is doing everything possible to help individuals and communities recover, and they found large discrepancies between state and federal aid provided.
Jacquee Petchel, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who serves as executive editor for News21, said the project is timely as earthquakes, wildfires, floods and all types of storms are occurring with more frequency.
""This deeply reported project brought to the forefront the lasting and troubling consequences of natural disasters and recovery, particularly for people living in remote, impoverished and storm-prone communities,"" Petchel said. ""What we found were thousands of people still coping with the aftermath, months and even years after the fact. ""
A News21 analysis of Federal Emergency Management Agency data over the past two decades shows that small disasters accounted for more than 60% of all federally declared disasters between 2003 and 2018. Yet they received at least $57.8 billion less in public assistance from FEMA.
The federal government also provided less individual assistance to survivors in communities with smaller disasters. Since 1999, 651 declared disasters did not receive any individual assistance.
The News 21 ""State of Emergency"" project includes 15 multimedia stories, portraits of more than 50 disaster survivors, and four half-hour documentaries on hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes and flooding. The students also produced a five-episode podcast that followed the disasters from the moment they hit through the long recovery process.
""We believe this work was not only remarkable in its scope, but also provided a national perspective on the woeful recovery efforts on the ground,"" Petchel said.
The investigation was published by major media organizations around the country, including the New York Times, The Washington Post, and the Associated Press, in addition to dozens of regional and local news outlets.
Reporters found that when a natural disaster strikes a community, families lose their homes, businesses close and livelihoods are lost. The elderly and people with disabilities cannot get their medications and services. Young people suffer mental health consequences and suicide rates climb.
Molly Duerig, of Pittsburgh, Pa., one of 14 Cronkite students who participated in the project, reported on last year's historic Midwest floods and then traveled to Puerto Rico for a story about Hurricane Maria's lasting impact on young people. She also co-wrote an investigative story on the electric power grid in the U.S. and storms that cause power outages.
""Throughout our reporting, we constantly evaluated how to most effectively and empathetically gather the information we needed to tell the most informative, sensitive story possible of how people respond and recover from natural disasters,"" Duerig said.
It was a challenge emotionally for the reporters, Duerig said, but it helped that storm victims appreciated the coverage. Two young sisters in rural Puerto Rico, for example, living in an abandoned schoolhouse, said they finally felt seen and understood.
The RFK Journalism Awards program honors outstanding reporting on issues that reflect Kennedy's passions, including human rights, social justice and the power of individual action in the U.S. and around the world. The winning entries were selected by a panel of judges in several rounds.
The Cronkite School received a $500 prize and a bronze bust of the late senator and U.S. attorney general.
News21 was established in 2005 by the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation to demonstrate that top journalism students can produce groundbreaking reporting on major national topics and present their findings in innovative ways.
Over the past decade, News21 projects have included investigations into hate in America, voting rights, marijuana laws, drinking water quality and guns in America.
Past projects also have won national awards for enterprise and explanatory reporting.
In addition to ASU, other universities that participated in the 2019 News21 program were Appalachian State University, DePauw University, Dublin City University, Elon University, George Washington University, Hofstra University, Kent State University, Louisiana State University, St. Bonaventure University, Syracuse University, University of British Columbia, University of Colorado Boulder, University of Iowa, University of Minnesota, University of North Texas, University of Oklahoma, University of Puerto Rico and University of Tennessee, Knoxville.
In addition to Duerig, the Cronkite students who participated in the ""State of Emergency"" project were Allie Barton of Gilbert, Arizona; Kailey Broussard of Lafayette, Louisiana; Jordan Elder of Kansas City, Missouri; Jake Goodrick of Cleveland, Ohio; Yael Grauer of Jerusalem; Carly Henry of Las Cruces, New Mexico; Anya Magnuson of Minneapolis, Minnesota; Harrison Mantas; Ellen O'Brien of Chandler, Arizona; McKenzie Pavacich of Asbury Park, N.J.; Ariel Salk of Phoenix, Arizona; Alex Simon of Redwood City, California; and Isaac Windes of Tucson, Arizona.
Other Cronkite RFK Winners:
2019
Students in News21 produced ""Hate in America,"" a multimedia package of stories, a documentary and a podcast that examined acts of intolerance, racism and hate crimes across the country.
2011
Students in an in-depth reporting class, working under the direction of Cronkite faculty members Rick Rodriquez and Jason Manning, won for ""Stateless in the Dominican Republic,"" which examined immigration and border issues in that country.
2010
News21 student David Kempa won for a multimedia story ""Crossing Lines"" about a man's mission to help impoverished Mexicans.
2009
Students in an in-depth reporting class won for ""Divided Families,"" which documented the effects of families separated by the U.S.-Mexico border.

The sudden and unexpected outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic is the most serious global public health emergency that humanity has experienced since the end of World War II. It is also a ""big test of human rights conditions"" for all countries across the globe. The virus does not respect borders, nor is race or nationality relevant in the face of the disease. Given this, to honor our common commitment to human rights, governments of different countries are obliged to adopt scientific measures for the prevention and control of the virus and do their best to ensure the health and safety of their people. Nevertheless, the U.S. government's self-interested, short-sighted, inefficient, and irresponsible response to the pandemic has not only caused the tragedy in which about 2 million Americans became infected with the virus and more than 110,000 have died from it, but also caused the exposure and deterioration of the long-existing problems within the United States, such as a divisive society, the polarization between the rich and the poor, racial discrimination, and the inadequate protection of the rights and interests of vulnerable groups. This has led the American people into grave human rights disasters.
1. The U.S. Government's Ineffective Response to the Pandemic Leading to Human Rights Disasters
Being distracted, slack, and opinionated in the face of the pandemic, the United States Federal Government declared a national emergency on March 13, after tens of thousands of deaths had occurred. The pandemic statistics released by Johns Hopkins University in the United States showed that as of June 9 Eastern Standard Time (EST), there had been 1,971,302 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 111,620 deaths from the virus in the United States, with both figures significantly higher than those of other countries. For the United States, which boasts the strongest economic and technological strength and the most abundant medical resources in the world, this is a sad irony.
Ignoring the Pandemic Warnings. According to the revisited timeline of the pandemic in the United States, which was released by The New York Times and Washington Post in April 2020, the U.S. government had repeatedly ignored the pandemic warnings and slacked off on pandemic control. In early January, the National Security Council (NSC) received intelligence reports predicting the spread of the virus in the United States. On January 29, Peter Navarro, Director of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy at the White House, laid out in striking detail the potential risks of a coronavirus pandemic: as many as half a million deaths and trillions of dollars in economic losses. U.S. health officials and medical experts, such as Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services Alex Azar, also repeatedly warned of the deadly pandemic in the United States. Unfortunately, the U.S. government ignored these warnings. Instead, it focused on controlling the spreading of information, restricted medical experts' freedom to release information on the pandemic to the public, and even published false information to mislead the public, such as calling the virus ""a flu"", claiming that the virus has low infection and fatality rates, and saying that ""One day it's like a miracle, it will disappear."" Under such circumstances, the ""golden window"" period for infectious disease prevention and control was wasted. Even then, many members of the U.S. Senate, including Richard Burr, who was the chairman of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, were involved in insider trading scandals. They used their positions to understand the serious situation of the pandemic earlier, but they downplayed the risk of the pandemic in front of the public while selling a large number of stocks before the pandemic triggered a stock market crash. In this way, they had a ""perfect hedge"".
Prioritizing Capital Interests. The website of The New York Times reported on April 13, 2020, that the White House COVID-19 Response Working Group and the NSC jointly prepared a memo dated February 14, which was titled ""U.S. Government Response to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus."" According to the report, the memo documented drastic pandemic-control measures including: ""significantly limiting public gatherings and cancellation of almost all sporting events, performances, and public and private meetings that cannot be convened by phone. Consider school closures."" Nevertheless, the decision-makers immediately rejected the memo after hearing that the measures would lead to the collapse of the U.S. stock market. This showed how the U.S. government prioritized capital interests and the response of the capital market, rather than making the people's right to life and health a priority. Due to this, the U.S. government failed to give effective warnings to the public and failed to get prepared for the potential consumption of medical resources caused by the pandemic, bringing the American people to the brink of infection and death.
Politicizing the Anti-pandemic Endeavor. When the virus broke out in the United States, some U.S. politicians used it as a weapon to attack political opponents and seek election benefits instead of regarding the drive to protect the lives and health of their people as their top priority. The website of The Lancet, an authoritative medical journal, published an editorial on May 16, which was a rare case for the journal. The editorial explicitly pointed out the intervention of political parties in the public health sector of the United States, and the weakening role of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It criticized the U.S. government for not actively adopting basic medical and anti-pandemic measures such as detection, tracking, and isolation, placing its hopes on ""magic bullets"" such as vaccines and new drugs, and hoping that the virus would eventually ""magically disappear"". On May 4, the famous U.S.political scientist Francis Fukuyama published the article The Wages of American Political Decay on the website The National Interest, pointing out that the highly polarized party politics made the political checks and balances an insurmountable obstacle to decision-making; that the pandemic, which should have been an opportunity to put aside differences and show unity, further deepened the political polarization. Politicians viewed the pandemic as an opportunity to seize power and partisan interests, and this came at the cost of the lives of countless American people.
Leading to Catastrophic Consequences. The website of The New York Times reported on May 20, 2020, that research by Columbia University of the United States showed that delays in adopting movement restrictions had caused at least 36,000 people to die. According to the research, if the U.S. government had adopted movement restrictions one week earlier, it could have saved 36,000 lives, and if the U.S. government had adopted movement restrictions two weeks earlier, 83 percent of the deaths from COVID-19 could have been avoided. On May 24, The New York Times unprecedentedly dedicated its entire front page to 1,000 U.S. COVID-19 victims. Their names, ages, and brief descriptions were listed under the headline ""U.S. Deaths Near 100,000, an Incalculable Loss,"" with a subheadline reading: ""They Were Not Simply Names on a List. They Were Us."" The website of the Time reported on May 20 that the delayed social-distancing measures caused 90 percent of the deaths from COVID-19 in the United States, and observed that such a huge loss of life was essentially a failure of U.S. democracy.
2. Inequality within U.S. Society Being Fully Exposed during the Pandemic
In the United States, both liberal and conservative scholars agree on one basic fact that there is stark inequality within U.S. society. The deep-seated institutional reason for such inequality is that the U.S. government and political parties have long been manipulated by interest groups, and are unable to formulate and implement tax, industrial, and social security policies that promote social equality. During the pandemic, the social and economic inequality within U.S. society has been exposed and exacerbated.
The Elite Class of the United States Being Specially Treated in Coronavirus Testing. Viral infection does not distinguish between rich and poor, but the limited testing and medical resources were not fairly allocated in the United States. The website of The New York Times reported on March 19, 2020, that many dignitaries in the United States somehow underwent virus testing when they had no signs of infection and when nearly every state in the country lacked testing equipment. Uche Blackstock, an emergency medicine physician, said frustratedly, ""As a physician, I find it upsetting that celebrities and government officials without symptoms have been able to access testing quickly with same-day results, while I've had to ration out testing to my patients with turnaround times of five or seven days."" This obvious injustice has made the public increasingly raise questions. When medical staff and many patients cannot be diagnosed, whether the privileged class obtains priority testing means that the ordinary people are deprived of testing opportunities. The website of The Guardian, a British newspaper, published an article on March 21 and commented that when the Titanic hit the iceberg and sank, women and children were protected and rescued first, but in the face of COVID-19, the United States has first rescued the rich and powerful groups. The gap between rich and poor in getting the virus tests in the United States has exposed the slackness, confusion, and injustice in its pandemic prevention and control system.
People at the Bottom of U.S.Society Facing an Increasingly Dangerous Situation. The pandemic has made the lives of people at the bottom of U.S. society increasingly difficult, and further intensified the social polarization between rich and poor. According to a CBS report in 2019, nearly 40 percent of Americans would struggle to cover a US$400 emergency expense, and 25 percent of Americans skipped necessary medical care because they could not afford the cost. The website of The Atlantic reported in April 2020 that low-income people in the United States would usually delay seeing a doctor when they became ill, not because they did not want to recover, but because they had no money at all. Faced with the COVID-19 pandemic, tens of millions of people in the United States are not covered by medical insurance, when intensive care for COVID-19 costs as high as tens of thousands of dollars in the country. ""To be or not to be"" is not just a philosophical proposition of some literary work, but a realistic choice that the people at the bottom of U.S. society have to make. Russia Today reported on April 30 that a Gallup survey revealed that one in seven American adults said that if they or their family members developed symptoms related to COVID-19, they would probably give up medical treatment because they were worried that they could not afford the costs. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, pointed out on April 16 that the poor in the United States were ""being hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic"". He observed, ""Low-income and poor people face far higher risks from the coronavirus due to chronic neglect and discrimination, and a muddled, corporate-driven federal response has failed them.""
High Unemployment Rates Leading the Working Class into a Crisis of Survival. According to data released by the U.S. Department of Labor on May 28, 2020, the cumulative number of Americans applying for unemployment relief from March 15 to May 23 has for the first time reached 40.8 million. Given the high unemployment rate brought about by the pandemic and the long-existing structural discrimination and polarization between rich and poor, the U.S. working class's ability to resist risks has greatly diminished. Vox News reported on April 10 that from the catering industry and tourism to the media industry, the entire U.S. economy has felt the impact of the pandemic, and just like the impact of other crises, the most vulnerable groups bore the brunt of the economic impact. According to the report, during the pandemic, the people who are most vulnerable amid layoffs are those who earn the lowest salaries, such as low-wage workers in the catering and retail industries. According to the report released by the National Restaurant Association on April 20, two-thirds of restaurant workers (about 8 million people) have been dismissed or put on vacation due to the pandemic. When the U.S. government launched the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which was intended to help small-and medium-sized enterprises, some large companies with sufficient funds took advantage of the rule loopholes to acquire huge loans, but small businesses and small shops that urgently needed loans to sustain themselves could not get the help. The above-mentioned report also showed that at least 60 percent of employers said that the existing relief plan of the federal government could not help them reduce layoffs. All this has revealed that the U.S. working class was the first to feel the pain of the economic recession brought about by the pandemic, and became the victims of the U.S. government's inefficient anti-pandemic measures.
3. Racial Discrimination Being Intensified within the United States during the Pandemic
The systemic racial discrimination is a chronic illness of U.S. society. Since 2016, white supremacy has revived and racial discrimination has intensified in the United States. Social tensions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, especially the unequal allocation of limited anti-pandemic resources, have further deepened mainstream society's discrimination against minorities, such as Asian, African, and Hispanic Americans.
Asian Americans Suffering from Stigmatization. The website of The Guardian, a British newspaper, pointed out on April 1, 2020 that stereotyping of Asian Americans still happens in the United States, and when reporting on the COVID-19 situation, some U.S. media always attach photos of Asian faces. The website of The New York Times observed on April 16 that the COVID-19 pandemic meant isolation for Asian Americans. Since the outbreak of the virus, Asian Americans have often been humiliated and even attacked in public places. Some U.S.politicians even deliberately misled the public. After the World Health Organization officially named the new coronavirus ""COVID-19"", senior U.S. leaders, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, still insisted on referring to the virus as the ""Chinese virus"" or ""Wuhan virus"". They also refused to correct that mistake even after being strongly criticized by the international community. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, Tendayi Achiume, pointed out on March 23 and April 21 that politicians of relevant countries proactively expressed xenophobic opinions or made xenophobic implications by deliberately replacing COVID-19 with other names that linked this particular disease to a particular country or nation, which was an irresponsible and disturbing expression. The current pandemic-related discrimination has fully exposed the once-concealed racial prejudice. In the United States, which bills itself as the ""beacon of freedom"", government officials blatantly incite, guide, and condone racial discrimination, which is tantamount to humiliating the modern concept of human rights.
African and Hispanic Americans Falling Victims to Severe Racial Inequality. Racial discrimination is deeply rooted in the history and reality of the United States. The COVID-19 pandemic has put this issue underneath a magnifying glass and tragically exposed its negative consequences. African Americans across the country are infected with and die from COVID-19 at a disproportionately higher rate than any other group in the United States. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) released a racial breakdown of the state's confirmed COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 deaths on April 2, 2020, which showed that African Americans, who make up only 12 percent of Michigan's population, accounted for 33 percent of Michigan's confirmed COVID-19 cases and 40 percent of the state's COVID-19 deaths. National statistics released by the CDC showed that as of May 13, African Americans accounted for 22.4 percent of deaths from COVID-19 in the United States. This percentage is significantly higher than the African Americans'12.5 percent share of the total U.S.population. African Americans in Kansas, Illinois, and Missouri accounted for only 5.7 percent, 14.1 percent, and 11.6 percent of the total population of the states, respectively, but accounted for 29.7 percent, 30.3 percent, and 35.1 percent of these states' deaths from COVID-19.Hispanic Americans also have disproportionately higher infection and fatality rates during the pandemic. In early April, New York City released a racial breakdown of the city's deaths from COVID-19.According to it, Hispanic Americans accounted for 34 percent of the city's fatal cases of COVID-19. The website of The New York Times pointed out on April 14 that the fact the pandemic infected and killed African and Hispanic Americans at disproportionately higher rates was the result of a health gap directly created by the historical inequality of wealth and opportunities. The website of the Financial Times, a British newspaper, pointed out on May 15 that African Americans and Hispanic Americans were more likely than whites to perform the work that was necessary for the maintenance of social operations, making them more susceptible to poverty, diabetes, high blood pressure, and COVID-19. The report also pointed out that this pandemic exacerbated the racial differences in the United States, and that nothing could better display the difference in skin color in the United States than the life and death stories in the pandemic shutdown. On May 25, George Floyd, an African-American man from Minnesota, died after a white police officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for several minutes during his arrest. This led to large-scale protests and demonstrations across the United States, once again exposing the dissatisfaction and anger that the American people have for the worsening racial inequality.
Frequent Racist Violence. During the pandemic, racist violence has haunted the United States, and Asian Americans suffer from venomous personal attacks. From March 19 to April 1, 2020, alone, the U.S. nonprofit organization ""Stop AAPI Hate ""received more than 1,100 reports of hate incidents. In February 2020, a 16-year-old Asian boy in Los Angeles was accused of being a ""virus carrier"" and viciously beaten at school. On March 14, in a supermarket in Midland, Texas, a 19-year-old man deliberately stabbed an Asian man and his two young children with a knife on the ground that ""they were Chinese and were spreading the novel coronavirus to others."" On April 5, an Asian woman in Brooklyn, New York City, was attacked by a racist who spilled unidentified chemical liquid on her to severely burn her upper body, face, and hands when she was emptying rubbish at her door. Violent incidents have further exacerbated the social tension during the pandemic, and problems such as a divisive society, racial divide, and the proliferation of guns have worsened. On April 15, nearly 200 U.S. foreign policy scholars and former diplomats jointly issued a statement in USA Today, pointing out that hate crimes and violent attacks against Asian Americans sounded the alarm for the United States, and that leaders at all levels and in all sectors should take action to oppose racism against Asians and end hate crimes against Asian communities.
4. Vulnerable Groups in the United States Struggling to Survive during the Pandemic
The care for the survival of socially disadvantaged and marginalized groups represents the virtue of a society. It is also a touchstone for the human rights situation in a country. During the pandemic, the features of the United States' cruel capitalism have been fully exposed, which have forced the elderly, homeless people, and children into a tragic situation.
The Elderly, the ""Victims"" of the Government's Ineffectiveness in Fighting the Pandemic. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has repeatedly stressed that the elderly, like young people, have the same rights to life and health amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and no person is expendable. Unfortunately, during the epidemic in the United States, the elderly group, which is naturally at greater risk, has been further weakened and marginalized due to age discrimination, and the elderly's right to life has not been ensured. On March 23 and April 22,2020, Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick expressed in interviews with Fox News that he would rather die than see public health measures damage the U.S. economy and take the risk of restarting the U.S. economy at the cost of elderly people's lives. Ben Shapiro, the editor-in-chief of The Daily Wire, which is a right-wing U.S. media outlet, declared coldly on an interview show on April 29, ""If somebody who is 81 dies of COVID-19, that is not the same thing as somebody who is 30 dying of COVID-19."" He also said, ""If grandma dies in a nursing home at age 81, and that's tragic and that's terrible, also the life expectancy in the United States is 80."" The website of The New York Times reported on May 11 that at least 28,100 occupants and staff members of long-term care institutions such as nursing homes in the United States have died of COVID-19, accounting for about one-third of COVID-19 deaths in the United States. In these care institutions, many elderly people live in a relatively closed environment, so their risk of death from COVID-19 infection is very high. The website of The Atlantic published two articles respectively on March 28 and April 29, titled Ageism Is Making the Pandemic Worse and We're Literally Killing Elders Now. They pointed out that long-existing defects in the old-age care system, such as insufficient capital investment and staffing, caused the United States to fall behind in ensuring the rights and interests of the elderly, and that such a situation was due to many political reasons. The website of the Washington Post observed on May 9 that the U.S. anti-pandemic action had become a state-approved massacre that deliberately sacrificed the lives of the elderly, the working class, African Americans, and Hispanic Americans.
The Homeless Having Nowhere to Go during the Pandemic. The website of USA Today reported on April 22, 2020, that more than 550,000 people were homeless every night in the United States. The report also pointed out that according to the statistics released by the Homeless Alliance, about 17 out of every 10,000 Americans have experienced homelessness and about 33 percent of them are families with children. Many of the homeless Americans are elderly people and disabled people. Given their originally poor physical health and bad living and hygienic conditions, they are susceptible to the virus. During the epidemic, the homeless who are living on the streets are deported and forced to live in temporary shelters for isolation. The website of Reuters reported on April 23 that the crowded shelters made it impossible for the homeless who lived there to maintain social distance, which made it easier for the virus to spread. As of April 20, 43 homeless people living in New York City's shelters had died from infection of COVID-19, and 617 tested positive for COVID-19.The website of The New York Times reported on April 13 that the shelters for the homeless had become a delayed-action bomb of a virus outbreak in New York City, where more than 17,000 people lived and slept almost side by side in centralized shelters. The website of Nature journal reported on May 7 that when researchers began conducting virus testing on homeless people in the United States, they found that the situation there had gotten out of control. The website of the Boston Globe reported on May 4 that 596 homeless people in Boston had been diagnosed with COVID-19, accounting for one-third of the confirmed cases in the region.
The website of the Los Angeles Times reported on May 14 that research showed that due to the impact of the pandemic, the number of homeless people in the United States might surge by as much as 45 percent within a year, further exacerbating the public health crisis.
Worrisome Situation of Poor Children and Immigrant Children. The United States has not yet ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which is one of the core international human rights conventions. In recent years, child poverty and abuse has remained a grave problem in the United States. This problem has been exacerbated by the pandemic. Forbes News reported on May 7, 2020 that a survey showed a large number of American children were facing hunger during the pandemic. As of the end of April, more than one-fifth of American households had been facing food crises, and two-fifths of American households with children under 12 years of age have been facing such crises. Forbes News reported on May 9 that the number of child exploitation reports in the United States surged during the pandemic. The National Center for Missing &Exploited Children received 4.2 million reports in April, an increase of 2 million from March 2020 and an increase of nearly 3 million from April 2019. Apart from that, a more worrisome fact is that a large number of unaccompanied immigrant children are still being held in detention centers in the United States. They are currently in an extremely dangerous situation during the pandemic. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on human rights of migrants Felipe Gonzalez Morales and other UN human rights experts issued a joint statement on April 27, requesting the U.S. government to transfer immigrants from overcrowded and insanitary detention centers. On May 29, 15 experts of the Special Procedures of United Nations Human Rights Council issued a joint statement urging the United States to take more measures to prevent virus outbreaks in the detention centers. The website of the United Nations reported on May 21 that since March, the U.S. government had repatriated at least 1,000 unaccompanied immigrant children to Central and South America regardless of the risk of the pandemic. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) criticized this move, for it would expose the children to greater danger.
5. Relevant Behaviors of the U.S. Government Seriously Violating the Spirit of International Human Rights Law
When the citizens' right to life and health is severely threatened by the spreading pandemic, the U.S. government, instead of focusing on controlling the pandemic, wields a hegemonic stick and fans the flames of trouble everywhere, trying to divert attention and shirk responsibility. Its behaviors have seriously undermined the international community's concerted efforts to control the pandemic.
Ineffective Anti-pandemic Efforts Failing the National Duty of Ensuring the Citizens' Right to Life. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) stipulates that every human being has the inherent right to life, and countries are obliged to take proactive measures to guarantee their citizens' right to life. As a party to the convention, the U.S.government, however, has not given priority to its citizens' right to life and health during the pandemic. Instead, it has been prioritizing the political campaign at home and the political drive to suppress China abroad, rather than safeguarding the lives and safety of its citizens. Given this, it has missed the best chance to curb the spread of the virus, and caused a grave human rights disaster in which about 2 million people have been infected with COVID-19, and more than 110,000 have died from the virus. Clearly, the U.S. government has failed to fulfill its due national obligations to protect its people's lives from the threat of epidemics. The website of The Independent, a British newspaper, commented on April 10, 2020, that the United States, an active advocator for human rights, ignored its own human rights obligations and blatantly overlooked its citizens' lives. The website of the Huffington Post reported on May 6 that after making a rigorous assessment of the U.S. government's poor performance during the COVID-19 pandemic, Yale University epidemiologist Gregg Gonsalves directly pointed out that this was getting awfully close to genocide by default.
Maliciously Stigmatizing China in Violation of the Principles of Equality and Non-discrimination. The principles of equality and nondiscrimination are the core norms of international human rights laws and are confirmed by a series of international human rights instruments, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Since the outbreak of the virus, high-ranking U.S. government officials have violently disregarded human conscience and ethical bottom lines. To maintain the U.S. hegemony, these officials have politicized the pandemic and constantly stigmatized China by referring to the virus as the ""Wuhan Virus"" or the ""China virus"".When the scientific community came to the conclusion that the exact source of the virus was from nature, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo still repeatedly claimed that the virus came from some lab in Wuhan according to some ""intelligence reports"" he read. These politicians' behaviors have clearly violated World Health Organization Best Practices for the Naming of New Human Infectious Diseases, which was jointly issued by the World Health Organization, the World Organization for Animal Health, and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 2015. The way they refer to the virus goes against the World Health Organization's suggestion for the official name of the novel coronavirus disease. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, Tendayi Achiume, pointed out on March 23 that some U.S. government officials refused to use the internationally-recognized name of the virus and deliberately replaced it with other names that linked this particular disease to a particular country or nation, which was an irresponsible and disturbing expression that came from and would give rise to racism, xenophobia, stigmatization, and exclusion of certain groups, and violence against certain groups. She held that such behaviors were unforgivable and incompatible with the obligations stipulated by the international human rights laws.
Suspending the Payment of WHO Membership Fees Impeding the Joint Anti-Pandemic Efforts of the International Community. In order to shirk its responsibility for its disastrous anti-pandemic measures, the U.S. government tried to scapegoat the World Health Organization by fabricating false charges against the organization and threatening to stop paying its membership fees. On April 14, 2020, the U.S. government announced its suspension of paying dues to the WHO, which was unanimously criticized by the international community. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued a statement on April 14 stating that when the world was fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, it was inappropriate to reduce the resources required by the WHO or any other humanitarian organization for operations. The President of the American Medical Association, Patrice Harris, issued a statement on April 15 stating that combating the pandemic required international cooperation and that the suspension of financial support to the WHO at this critical moment is a dangerous step in the wrong direction. Josep Borrell, the European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, expressed on April 15 that at this time, there was no reason to justify such an action. On April 15, the website of The Guardian, a British newspaper, published an editorial and commented that when the world desperately needed to jointly overcome this threat that the world had never experienced before, the suspension of the WHO dues by the U.S.government was an act that lacked morality and disrupted the international order, and was a horrible betrayal to global solidarity. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on April 16 that the WHO was the mainstay of the global fight against the pandemic, and the suspension of the WHO dues by the United States at this time ""would be nothing other than throwing the pilot out of the plane in mid-flight"".Under such circumstances, the U.S.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo once again attacked the WHO on April 22, threatening to permanently suspend the payment of dues. On May 29, the president of the United States announced the suspension of relations with the WHO.
Unilateral Sanctions Violating the Spirit of Humanitarianism and the Principle of International Cooperation. International cooperation is the cornerstone of the existence and operation of the international community. It is an important principle for ensuring the implementation of human rights and fundamental freedoms across the globe. It is also a national obligation stipulated by international instruments, such as the Charter of the United Nations. At this critical moment when the deadly pandemic spreads globally and threatens human life, health, and well-being, all countries should work together to respond to the pandemic and maintain global public health security. Nevertheless, during this pandemic, the U.S. government has still imposed sanctions on countries such as Iran, Cuba, and Venezuela, which made it difficult for the sanctioned countries to obtain needed anti-pandemic medical supplies in a timely manner, and posed threats to the people's rights to life and health in the sanctioned countries. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, expressed on March 24, 2020, that in the case of a global pandemic, sanctions would hinder medical work and increase risks for everyone. She argued that to maintain global public health security and protect the rights and lives of millions of people in sanctioned countries, sanctions should be relaxed or suspended in certain sectors. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, the Special Rapporteur on human rights for safe drinking water and sanitation, and the Special Rapporteur on the right to education issued a joint statement on May 6 stating that the U.S. sanctions on Venezuela were seriously harming the human rights of the people in the country. They urged the United States to immediately lift sanctions that exacerbated the suffering of the people when the pandemic raged in the country.

Aired 10-10:30a ET",FALSE,"[10:00:00]
POPPY HARLOW, CNN NEWSROOM: Good morning. I'm Poppy Harlow.
JIM SCIUTTO, CNN NEWSROOM: And I'm Jim Sciutto.
Soon, ex-Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin charged with second- degree murder in the killing of George Floyd will face a judge for the first time. That is set to happen at the same time a public memorial is taking place in George Floyd's hometown of Houston. After two weeks of protests nationwide following Floyd's death, a historic move now by the Minneapolis City Council.
HARLOW: That's right. Over the weekend, voting to defund and also dismantle the city's police department and to replace it with a new system of public safety. What would that actually look like? Can they do it? We'll talk about what that change would look like in just a moment.
In the wake of all of this, there is a brand-new CNN poll this morning, and it shows troubling numbers for the presidents on his handling of the protest in the wake of George Floyd's death and also on the coronavirus pandemic and his head-to-head matchup on Joe Biden, who is gaining a national lead.
Let's begin this hour though with our colleague, Omar Jimenez. He joins us in Houston. Walk us through what we will see and hear today at the memorial.
OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Poppy and Jim, it would be just around noon local time through 6:00 P.M., that the public will have a chance to say their last goodbye to George Floyd inside the Fountain of Praise Church behind me. They are already loading flowers in. And due to social distancing rules, people will go in 15 at a time is the max, as we understand, wearing masks and gloves, and they will spend no longer than ten minutes in their to pay their final respects. This is the public's last chance to say goodbye in what has been a series of good-byes so far.
And while the entire world is reflecting on a day like this, so too, if not more than ever, Houston. This is a place where he grew up. And when you speak to people he grew up with, like Stephen Jackson, a friend and former NBA player, here is what he had to say about what it means to the City of Houston.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
STEPHEN JACKSON, FRIEND OF GEORGE FLOYD: I've been so focused on getting judgment and this newfound leadership role that fell in my lap, but it's going to be -- it's a crazy day for the city. I mean, you just don't feel it in the neighborhood where he grew up at because I've been there are at the last few days. But the city is feeling this type of wind (ph). And they are ready to put him to rest, put him to rest the right way.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
JIMENEZ: And also happening today, Joe Biden is expected to visit here in Houston to visit privately with the family, that instead of attending funeral service set for tomorrow. We are told they didn't want their security presence to disrupt anything there. But they will be recording a video message for that service, a service that is expected to be private with some invited guests as well where we do expect Floyd to be buried next to his mother. Poppy, Jim?
SCIUTTO: Omar Jimenez in Houston, thanks very much.
CNN's Josh Campbell, he's in Minneapolis. So, Josh, it's early in the legal proceedings involving the officer who kneeled on Floyd's neck, Derek Chauvin, but what do we expect to happen as he faces a judge for the first time today?
JOSH CAMPBELL, CNN SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Jim. In just a couple hours time, we'll see the first appearance of former Officer Derek Chauvin. He will be appearing by video link to a judge in the courtroom behind me. We'll be there in court. And, obviously, we know based on the charges that he is charged with second-degree murder, as well as third-degree murder and manslaughter in the death of George Floyd.
And what we're waiting to see is whether his defense attorney will signal what their strategy is going to be. We know that when we're in court for the hearing of the other three officers as their attorneys attempted to attack the government's case, we began to see what their strategy was, and that was largely for two of the officers to blame Chauvin and his seniority, saying that he was largely responsible for this incident.
We'll be waiting to hear again what Chauvin's strategy might be. That will be here in just a couple of hours time. Guys?
HARLOW: Josh, before you go, can you talk, because you have such expertise on this about what it means that there was a veto-proof majority vote over the weekend to completely disband the Minneapolis Police Department? Can it legally happen? What would it be replaced with? And what happens next?
CAMPBELL: Yes, this move is causing a lot of questions. Now, I talked to the city council president yesterday and she told me that she has nine members of the city council that are now prepared to vote to dismantle the city's police department. And in her words, she told us that she doesn't believe that the police department is effectively serving the community. Let's listen to what she said.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
LISA BENDER, PRESIDENT, MINNEAPOLIS CITY COUNCIL: The system isn't working for too many of our neighbors for too long.
[10:05:01]
Our reform efforts have failed, and we have done many, many attempts at reform and new leadership at the department and many things, and we still see this tragic death.
And so I think the wake-up of our community is what's driving the city council's announcement yesterday.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CAMPBELL: Now, that was her speaking this morning also to CNN's New Day. And as I mentioned, there are a lot of questions being raised about this decision. Typically, the police department falls under the purview of the mayor. We've heard from the mayor. He is not in favor of disbanding the police department. But the city council president says that she believes that they have a lot of latitude because this department is under investigation by the Human Rights Commission.
I think, bottom line, guys, this is going to end up in the courts. We'll have to wait and see whether or not they're actually effective at dismantling and rebuilding the police department. Jim, Poppy?
HARLOW: So unprecedented and so important to watch. Josh, thanks very, very much.
Let's talk more about this with our Legal Analyst and former federal prosecutor, Elliot Williams.
Elliot, we'll get to that in a moment in terms of potentially disbanding the Minneapolis Police Department, but let's talk first about today and the first appearance in court before a judge of ex- Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin. In the context of the fact that we've heard at least partial defenses from his three fellow officers, some of them pointing the blame at him. Will we hear some of his defense today?
ELLIOT WILLIAMS, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: We might. Now, it's interesting. Sort of as Josh had said, we heard some of that last week.
Now, remember, under the Constitution, defendants never have to say anything in court. You know term, you have the right to remain silent. Well, that also applies at trial. What these early hearings give defendants a chance to do is sort of tease what arguments they are going to put out into the record.
And so, for instance, what we might hear him says if he doesn't testify -- what everyone is saying is this is a really a good chance for P.R. on the part of Detective Chauvin's lawyers, and so nothing will be challenged here.
He could say, you know, nothing will be credibly -- everything will be credibly reported by reporters afterward, far more credibly than if he'd stepped outside and done a press conference. And so, yes, we might see some of that today.
And I think what it might be if he is to go there, is to say, look, it's the fog of war, in the heat of the moment, I'm an officer, my job is very hard, and, certainly, this death was a tragedy. But this is sort of what happens to officers when faced in stressful positions.
Now, look, that's not a very compelling argument to you or me because we saw that video. But, again, what he's trying to do is get into the heads of a potential jurors. People are watching the news. And the people who are going to pick this jury in Minneapolis, you're just trying to sort of -- use the word, take them (ph), but sort (INAUDIBLE) and so get them to start viewing his case a little bit more favorably.
SCIUTTO: What can Congress do to make a difference here? You have legislation introduced this morning in the House. I mean, among the measures, one sponsored that would make it illegal to use a chokehold.
And as I ask this question, Elliot, just so you're aware and our viewers, this is the hearse of George Floyd arriving in Houston for the last public memorial for George Floyd, Houston his hometown. That's why it's taking place there. Of course, his death occurred in Minneapolis.
We were told today, we learned that the former vice president, Joe Biden, will meet with Floyd's family today privately, not take part in a larger service there because the family was concerned that Biden's security detail might cause some problems, get in the way of the broader celebration of his life here. We're going to continue to follow that service as it takes place today.
But, Elliot, back to charges, right, because folks watching this might say to themselves, okay, I've seen incidents like this before and I've heard a lot of talk, but I haven't seen much change. Legally, is it Congress that needs to take action, wait for action in the courts? Where do you see substantive change taking place?
WILLIAMS: Well, okay, the big picture answer to your question is that society needs to change. Biases need to change. Police are just one reflection of that on a day-to-day level, and they're armed. But we just need to address implicit bias and the biases we frankly all hold, even black people, against other black people before any of this can be fixed.
Now, to the legal question, a lot of the doctrines that people are talking, like qualified immunity, we've even talked about that concept on this show before, comes from the courts. And under our system of separation of powers, Congress can just legislate around that. So Congress can pass a bill limiting or eliminating qualified immunity. Congress can create a national misconduct registry. Congress can ban and regard as unlawful, no-knock warrants, like sort of where officers can just go and enter someone's homes. They can make lynching a hate crime.
All of these things can be done by Congress and as a far more important and far more immediate than waiting for courts to address them.
[10:10:04]
HARLOW: On the issue of qualified immunity that Jim and I are particularly interested in, and, you know, we talked a lot about on the program, Joey Jackson said to us last hour, yes, yes, yes, but that only deals with civil cases when police officers are sued. It wouldn't impact a criminal trial. Is the that the case?
WILLIAMS: That is true. Again, qualified immunity applies in federal civil rights suits, so you would take it up. But, again, that's a big deal because, you know, what qualified immunity does is just almost bar suits against police officers for their conduct. I mean, that's a little bit of a simplification of it, but it would be a big deal.
But, again what, we need and frankly you're seeing some of this in Minneapolis is a rethinking of how we approach law enforcement and policing and that's kind of reflected in the Minneapolis' decision by the city council recently.
SCIUTTO: Elliot Williams, always good to have you on. Thanks very much.
WILLIAMS: Thank you.
SCIUTTO: Well, as you know, a few places in the world have been hit harder by coronavirus than New York City. Today, the city, after months of lockdown, taking its first tentative steps towards reopening.
HARLOW: And in minutes, House and Senate Democrats will push their plan to stop police brutality and start recording patterns of misuse of force. You just heard Elliot talk about that. We'll bring their remarks live.
And following nearly two weeks of nationwide protests, a new CNN poll finds a growing majority of Americans feel that racism is a significant problem in this country, and it also shows that it could hurt the president in November.
[10:15:00]
HARLOW: After a 78-day shutdown, New York City is entering phase one of reopening, and it begins today. The city is hitting all of the necessary benchmarks to start to reopen after more than 200,000 people here were infected and more than 21,000 deaths in New York City alone.
SCIUTTO: CNN's Alexandra Field joining us from New York. So, Alexandra I think it's safe to call these baby steps in terms of reopening. What is open as of today? ALEXANDRA FIELD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, baby steps, first steps, but still incredibly significant if you think about all that New York City has gone through in the last 100 days since the first coronavirus case was diagnosed here in the city.
So the signs of life that we're seeing out here on the street this morning, well, some 400,000 people who are expected to head back to work, a couple hundred thousand people expected to possibly take mass public transportation, the busses, the subways, which are still being cleaned overnight but are open to riders during the day. No, you can't really maintain social distance on the subways but ,asks are being handed out for people who don't have them.
We're seeing new retail stores opening up. They'll be doing curbside pickup or some quick in-store pickup. Those are stores that have been closed down for months now. We're also seeing construction workers back at it, wholesale trade jobs back at it and manufacturing back on line.
So, significant steps but certainly not fully back but this is because health data has all been moving in the right direction. Officials saying we can now start the phase one of opening, joining the rest of the state, which has already started to reopen well in advance of New York. Jim, Poppy?
HARLOW: And, Alex, as we get this, which is good news for a lot of people in the city, data also that is just horrifying in terms of showing the disproportionate impact of COVID on communities of color, double the number of blacks and Latinos in New York City died from it than New York City than whites.
FIELD: Twice as many black and Latinos than whites here in New York and we have for the course of this pandemic been talking about the disproportionate effect of coronavirus on people of color across the country.
And this is certainly something that is fueling a lot of what we've been hearing out here on the streets over the past week as you've seen thousands of demonstrators --
HARLOW: Alex, I'm so sorry, sorry to interrupt. Let's go to Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, in Emancipation Hall setting a moment, eight minutes and 46 seconds of silence in honor of the life of George Floyd.
REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): -- aptly named for those who built the Capitol sadly.
Last summer, a number of us under the leadership Karen Bass went to Ghana to observe the 400th anniversary of the first slaves coming across the Atlantic, that tragedy, that horror of history, event, slavery in our own country and then all of the consequences of that.
We are here to observe that pain. We are here to respect the actions of the American people to speak out against that, specifically manifested in police brutality. We are here to honor George Floyd. In a moment, we will have a moment of silence, actually eight minutes and 46 seconds of silence in honor of George Floyd and so many others who lost their lives or were abused by police brutality.
Before that, I want to yield to the distinguished leader of the Senate, Mr. Schumer.
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): Well, thank you, Madam Speaker, and thank you for this profound and important moment before we go forward with our strong and comprehensive legislation.
Now, Senate Democrats held a similar moment of silence last week where we stood for eight minutes and 46 seconds to mark the horrible death of George Floyd.
[10:20:02]
To every one of us, it was excruciating. It seemed an unbearably long amount of time, felt -- it felt so painful to get even an inkling of how this man and so many other black Americans have suffered for so long.
Every American --
SCIUTTO: You see Chuck Schumer there, the Senate minority leader, they are preparing Democrats in Emancipation Hall to hold a moment of silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds the amount of time that George Floyd had a knee on his neck before he died under the knee of Derek Chauvin.
Today, we will continue to follow that. But joining us now for more on the outbreak and all news regarding the outbreak, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Sanjay, always good to have you on.
New data today, this is a study published in the journal, Nature, that says that were it not for nationwide stay-at-home orders, that there would be 60 million more coronavirus infections here in the U.S. And I wonder -- listen, these are models, and you always have to take models with, if not, a grain of salt just understanding that they are projections, not hard fact, but do you find that number credible? And if you do, are you concerned that as nation reopens but also as you see nationwide protests that some of those gains will be lost?
DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. I think these are credible numbers, first of all, Jim. I mean, you know, there's going to be all sorts of studies out there that look at this sort of thing, but we know this is a very contagious virus.
Everyone is becoming familiar with these terms, but the R naught, which is basically the idea of how many people with one person spread it to unmitigated, if there was no sort of mitigation measures in place, they said between two and three people.
If you start to carry that out several cycles, that means one individual could start spreading this to thousand people. And if you start amplify that around the country, you see where they say 60 million people may have been infected by this.
If you also say, well, look, there's a 1 percent to 2 percent, we don't know the true mortality rate, but 1 to 2 percent, you can see why people thought that maybe a million people could potentially die from this in the United States alone. So, again, there's going to be all sorts of different analyses here.
I do worry though, and I think it goes without saying, as more people start to aggregate, as you see the country start reopen, the numbers will go up. It is a different sort of reopening though, right? I mean, we think of it open or closed, open.
You know, I see a lot of people even in my own community, they are out and about more, but many people are maintaining some physical distance which we know can reduce transmission six-fold. We know people are more likely to be wearing masks, which can also reduce transmission six-fold. These things make a difference. The numbers will go up but I think not nearly as much as they otherwise would.
HARLOW: Sanjay, stand by if you could just for a moment. We want to take our viewers back to Emancipation Hall, where members of Congress, Senate and House Democrats honoring eight minutes and 46 seconds of silence in remembrance of George Floyd.
These images of members of the House and Senate, Senate Democrats, House Democrats, kneeling there in Emancipation Hall, of course, named for the slaves who helped build and construct the Capitol, honoring George Floyd and his life and the eight minutes and 46 seconds that Officer Chauvin's Knee was on his neck.
We'll be right back.
[10:25:00]
HARLOW: At any moment now, Democrats are set to unveil their platform to try to reform policing across the country. Included in this expansive proposal from the House and the Senate, a federal ban on chokeholds being used by police and reforms to qualified immunity that largely protects police officers in court.
SCIUTTO: CNN's Manu Raju, he's on Capitol Hill this morning.
So, Manu, what else is in this bill, and, crucially, does it is have any shot in the Republican-controlled Senate?
[10:30:05]
MANU RAJU, CNN SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: At the moment, it does not. This is an expansive measure that Democrats do."

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R 5602) to authorize dedicated domestic terrorism offices within the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to analyze and monitor domestic terrorist activity and require the Federal Government to take steps to prevent domestic terrorism, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R 5602 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act of 2020''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) Recent reports have demonstrated that White supremacists and other far-right-wing extremists are the most significant domestic terrorism threat facing the United States, including-- (A) a February 22, 2019, New York Times op-ed, by a Trump Administration United States Department of Justice official, who wrote that ``white supremacy and far-right extremism are among the greatest domestic-security threats facing the United States. Regrettably, over the past 25 years, law enforcement, at both the Federal and State levels, has been slow to respond. . . . Killings committed by individuals and groups associated with far-right extremist groups have risen significantly.''; (B) an April 2017 Government Accountability Office report on the significant, lethal threat posed by domestic violent extremists, which-- (i) explained that ``[s]ince September 12, 2001, the number of fatalities caused by domestic violent extremists has ranged from 1 to 49 in a given year.''; and (ii) noted that ``[F]atalities resulting from attacks by far right wing violent extremists have exceeded those caused by radical Islamist violent extremists in 10 of the 15 years, and were the same in 3 of the years since September 12, 2001. Of the 85 violent extremist incidents that resulted in death [[Page H4584]] since September 12, 2001, far right wing violent extremist groups were responsible for 62 (73 percent) while radical Islamist violent extremists were responsible for 23 (27 percent).''; and (C) an unclassified May 2017 joint intelligence bulletin from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security, which found that ``white supremacist extremism poses [a] persistent threat of lethal violence,'' and that White supremacists ``were responsible for 49 homicides in 26 attacks from 2000 to 2016 . . . more than any other domestic extremist movement''. (2) Recent domestic terrorist attacks include-- (A) the August 5, 2012, mass shooting at a Sikh gurdwara in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, in which a White supremacist shot and killed 6 members of the gurdwara; (B) the April 13, 2014, mass shooting at a Jewish community center and a Jewish assisted living facility in Overland Park, Kansas, in which a neo-Nazi shot and killed 3 civilians, including a 14-year-old teenager; (C) the June 8, 2014, ambush in Las Vegas, Nevada, in which 2 supporters of the far-right-wing ``patriot'' movement shot and killed 2 police officers and a civilian; (D) the June 17, 2015, mass shooting at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in which a White supremacist shot and killed 9 members of the church; (E) the November 27, 2015, mass shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in which an anti-abortion extremist shot and killed a police officer and 2 civilians; (F) the March 20, 2017, murder of an African-American man in New York City, allegedly committed by a White supremacist who reportedly traveled to New York ``for the purpose of killing black men''; (G) the May 26, 2017, attack in Portland, Oregon, in which a White supremacist allegedly murdered 2 men and injured a third after the men defended 2 young women whom the individual had targeted with anti-Muslim hate speech; (H) the August 12, 2017, attacks in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which-- (i) a White supremacist killed one and injured nineteen after driving his car through a crowd of individuals protesting a neo-Nazi rally, and of which former Attorney General Jeff Sessions said, ``It does meet the definition of domestic terrorism in our statute.''; and (ii) a group of 6 men linked to militia or White supremacist groups assaulted an African-American man who had been protesting the neo-Nazi rally in a downtown parking garage; (I) the July 2018 murder of an African-American woman from Kansas City, Missouri, allegedly committed by a White supremacist who reportedly bragged about being a member of the Ku Klux Klan; (J) the October 24, 2018, shooting in Jeffersontown, Kentucky, in which a White man allegedly murdered 2 African Americans at a grocery store after first attempting to enter a church with a predominantly African-American congregation during a service; (K) the October 27, 2018, mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in which a White nationalist allegedly shot and killed 11 members of the congregation; (L) the April 27, 2019, shooting at the Chabad of Poway synagogue in California, in which a man yelling anti-Semitic slurs allegedly killed a member of the congregation and wounded 3 others; (M) the August 3, 2019, mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, in which a White supremacist with anti-immigrant views killed 22 people and injured 26 others; (N) the December 10, 2019, shooting at a Kosher supermarket in Jersey City, New Jersey, in which 2 men with anti-Semitic views killed 3 people in the store and a law enforcement officer in an earlier encounter; and (O) the December 28, 2019, machete attack at a Hanukkah celebration in Monsey, New York, in which a man who had expressed anti-Semitic views stabbed 5 individuals. (3) In November 2019, the Federal Bureau of Investigation released its annual hate crime incident report, which found that in 2018, violent hate crimes reached a 16-year high. Though the overall number of hate crimes decreased slightly after three consecutive years of increases, the report found a 4-percent increase in aggravated assaults, a 15-percent increase in simple assaults, and a 13-percent increase in intimidation. There was also a nearly 6-percent increase in hate crimes directed at LGBTQ individuals and a 14-percent increase in hate crimes directed at Hispanic and Latino individuals. Nearly 60 percent of the religion-based hate crimes reported targeted American Jews and Jewish institutions. The previous year's report found that in 2017, hate crimes increased by approximately 17 percent, including a 23-percent increase in religion-based hate crimes, an 18- percent increase in race-based crimes, and a 5-percent increase in crimes directed against LGBTQ individuals. The report analyzing 2016 data found that hate crimes increased by almost 5 percent that year, including a 19-percent rise in hate crimes against American Muslims. Similarly, the report analyzing 2015 data found that hate crimes increased by 6 percent that year. Much of the 2015 increase came from a 66- percent rise in attacks on American Muslims and a 9-percent rise in attacks on American Jews. In all 4 reports, race- based crimes were most numerous, and those crimes most often targeted African Americans. (4) On March 15, 2019, a White nationalist was arrested and charged with murder after allegedly killing 50 Muslim worshippers and injuring more than 40 in a massacre at the Al Noor Mosque and Linwood Mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand. The alleged shooter posted a hate-filled, xenophobic manifesto that detailed his White nationalist ideology before the massacre. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern labeled the massacre a terrorist attack. (5) In January 2017, a right-wing extremist who had expressed anti-Muslim views was charged with murder for allegedly killing 6 people and injuring 19 in a shooting rampage at a mosque in Quebec City, Canada. It was the first- ever mass shooting at a mosque in North America, and Prime Minister Trudeau labeled it a terrorist attack. (6) On February 15, 2019, Federal authorities arrested U.S Coast Guard Lieutenant Christopher Paul Hasson, who was allegedly planning to kill a number of prominent journalists, professors, judges, and ``leftists in general''. In court filings, prosecutors described Lieutenant Hasson as a ``domestic terrorist'' who in an email ``identified himself as a White Nationalist for over 30 years and advocated for `focused violence' in order to establish a white homeland.''. (7) On November 3rd, 2019 a 24 year old man who authorities say was among masked Antifa supporters attacking conservatives at a June Demonstration in Portland, Oregon, was sentenced Friday to nearly six years in prison in connection with brutal assault. Gage Halupowski pleaded guilty to second-degree assault after authorities accused him of using a weapon against a conservative demonstrator who suffered blows to the head that the victim claims left him with a concussion and cuts that required 25 staples to close. (8) On December 12, 2019, an assailant involved in the prolonged firefight in Jersey City, NJ, that left six people dead, including one police officer, was linked on Wednesday to the Black Hebrew Israelite movement, and had public anti- Semitic posts online, a law enforcement official said. (9) On February 8, 2020, A gunman stormed a NYPD precinct after firing at police van, wounding 2. The police commissioner called the Bronx rampage an ``assassination attempt,'' on law enforcement. (10) In August 2020, a juvenile armed with a semi-automatic rifle heeded the online call posted by a self-proclaimed militia group on Facebook to confront protestors in Kenosha, Wisconsin. He allegedly shot and killed two protestors and wounded a third. After the shootings, local police officers waved the alleged murderer through their lines, even after bystanders identified him as the shooter. The armed juvenile then traveled across State lines to his home. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. There are authorized to be appropriated to the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Defense such sums as may be necessary to carry out this Act. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and the gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. Armstrong) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas. General Leave Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Texas? There was no objection. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. First, I certainly want to thank all of the sponsors of this bill, and I thank Mr. Schneider for all of the important work that has been done on this legislation. With the consideration of H.R 5602, the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act, the House takes affirmative steps in this time to address the rising menace of domestic terrorism and white supremacy. This bill creates three offices, one each within the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to monitor, investigate, and prosecute cases of domestic terrorism. These newly created offices would focus their resources based on data collected on the most significant threats with specific emphasis on white supremacist terrorism. Additionally, pursuant to this bill, DOJ and DHS would issue joint biennial reports to Congress assessing the state of domestic terrorism threats. Let me say, Mr. Speaker, that this legislation is not based on a whim. It is not based on someone's taste or distaste; likes or dislikes. This is based on facts. And as we continue to view the modeling of domestic terrorism, we will begin to continue to respond to it legislatively. But now we have a solid base of information dealing with the issues of growing white supremacy. The creation of these offices and congressional reporting are much- needed measures to refocus the Federal Government's domestic terrorism efforts on the greatest threat to the American people: white supremacy and white nationalism. In April of last year, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing titled: ``Hate Crimes and the Rise of White Nationalism.'' Sadly, since then there have been countless domestic terrorism attacks. The shooting spree at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, in August of 2019 was the deadliest attack in modern times against the Latino community in the United States and the third deadliest act of violence by domestic terrorism extremists in more than 50 years. I joined my colleagues who represented that area, and the pain that they experienced was without comparison. I went to a funeral. I went to the memorial. I went to where the place was that had been set up as a temporary place of honor. The pain was unceasing in that community. And just a few months ago, they had to commemorate the bitterness of 1 year. I also went to the hospital and visited individuals who had put themselves in the line of fire to protect others. I think since that time one person, in particular, has passed away. This was a painful experience, and I can imagine that it will be painful for a very long time. In the last decade, places of worship, a Sikh temple in Milwaukee, the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, Mother Emanuel, where the victims who remained alive actually forgave the perpetrator who came and sat down and prayed; sat among people who were praying, who welcomed him. They lost a distinguished pastor and people who were so kind. People could not understand why they lost their lives. Thousands came to the memorial, and, of course, our President at that time, President Obama. That is how painful it was for this Nation. Then, of course, Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue. I visited Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and met individuals who had been impacted by this horrific tragedy. In the midst of Rosh Hashanah, to our friends who are in the midst of their holiday, it is more than fitting that we acknowledge how domestic terrorism can divide so many communities, so many innocent communities, whether they happen to be of a particular faith, a particular ethnicity, or a particular status. We have seen all of this become tragic symbols of deadly threats a white supremacist poses even to the faith community. Just last Thursday in a committee that I participated in, FBI Director Christopher Wray--the Homeland Security Committee--once again stated that white supremacists constitute the largest portion of racially motivated violent extremists. In the same vein, before the House Homeland Security Committee, Director Wray testified that antigovernment and antiauthority groups have been responsible for the most lethal attacks this year. We know that. So we want to be sure that we are protecting the American people. None of us adhere to extremism or violence. We understand peaceful protests, but we stand for the principles of democracy of this Nation that has kept us a democracy for all of these many years. Just a few weeks ago our Nation was reminded how dangerous violent extremism can be. A rightwing militia boasting 3,000 members promoted an event on Facebook calling for patriots willing to take up arms and travel to Kenosha, Wisconsin, to confront protesters. Tragically, hours later, a 17-year-old youth heeded the call, traveled across State lines, and is alleged to have murdered two protesters and injured a third. He has yet to be brought to justice because he is still waiting on an extradition procedure. Yet, local police allowed this young man to safely pass through their lines and go home, despite the fact that bystanders had identified him as the shooter. That was one incident. We have seen law enforcement take up the issues of protecting our neighbors across the Nation and in those instances, of course, we recognize good policing and we thank them for it. [[Page H4587]] The tragic events in Kenosha are yet another example of how rightwing militia groups continue to pose a present threat. Indeed, over the last decade, rightwing extremists have been responsible for 76 percent of all domestic extremist-related murders. The time for Congress to act is now. The key elements of the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act seek to address fundamental deficiencies highlighted at the April 2019 Judiciary Committee hearing in the Federal Government's response to domestic terrorism and specifically white supremacy. Let me be very clear. We want a comprehensive response to terrorism. We want to rely upon our intelligence communities as it relates to international terrorism. {time} 1500 We have done so because I have been on the Homeland Security Committee for a very long time and, as well, have seen the work of the Judiciary Committee. But we must be comprehensive in looking at terrorism; we must be responsive; and we must secure and make sure the American people are safe. Currently, the Federal Government has a number of statutory authorities to bring charges against domestic terrorists, including those who are white supremacists. Yet, it is clear that the Department of Justice has not initiated a sufficient number of these prosecutions. H.R 5602 creates offices within the DOJ and DHS aimed at pooling the resources from all parts of each respective Department to focus them on the greatest threat of white supremacy. The reporting elements of this bill aim to keep Congress better informed of the domestic terrorism threats presented so that Congress can more readily assess what resources and authorities are necessary to protect the country against domestic terrorist activities. I am well aware of the work that was done in the last administration of trying to neutralize the idea of radicalizing individuals who were dealing with ISIS, al-Qaida, and others. Unfortunately, even that has been taken away from the work that we have been doing. This may be a time that that work begins to rise up as it relates to white supremacy and white nationalism. This legislation is a necessary and measured response to the real threats this country faces. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, at a time when violent extremists are destroying cities nationwide, our Democratic colleagues here in the House continue to ignore this violence. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee even called Antifa violence a myth and imaginary. Instead of addressing violent leftwing extremism head-on, my colleagues across the aisle only want to use this bill for political purposes. They are not interested in passing legislation that would make any real difference in rooting out violence in our communities. Democrats are unable to call out the violent anarchists who are burning down cities all around the country. Instead, they seem to want to paint a picture that ties only conservatives to domestic terrorism. Not only is this bill blatantly political on its face, but it increases our already bloated bureaucracy by adding three new separate offices to do the exact same thing. That is the very definition of duplication and government waste. We already have dedicated law enforcement who fight domestic terrorism every day, and we should recognize them, commend them, and let them do their jobs. Unfortunately, my colleagues across the aisle likely will not do that either. Democrats must end the partisan charades. Democrats must stop ignoring the leftwing violence and crime that has taken over American cities. Instead of this biased approach in this bill, we should pass legislation that roots out all kinds of domestic terrorism, not just the type that is politically convenient for Democrats. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing H.R 5602, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, just one point that I want to make as I yield to the author and leader on this bill is that we are continuously fighting a known, recognized domestic terrorism. This vital bill will provide the reporting for a roadmap to do the right thing. That is what the Federal Government is challenged and charged to do. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Schneider). Congressman Schneider is a member of the Judiciary Committee and is the author of this legislation. Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentlewoman from Texas, for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise in support of my bill, H.R 5602, the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act of 2020. White supremacists and other far-right extremists are the most significant domestic terrorism threat facing the United States. Don't take my word for it. Making that point last week in testimony to the House Homeland Security Committee, FBI Director Christopher Wray stated that domestic violence extremists, DVEs, ``pose a steady and evolving threat of violence and economic harm to the United States.'' He notes in his next paragraph: ``The top threat we face from domestic violent extremists stems from those we identify as racially/ ethnically motivated violent extremists (RMVE).'' RMVEs were the primary source of ideologically motivated lethal incidents and violence in 2018 and 2019. From the Tree of Life synagogue to Walmart in El Paso, Texas, we have all tragically seen the deadly effect. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, the number of white nationalist groups rose by 55 percent since 2017. Last November, the FBI reported violent hate crimes reached a 16-year high in 2018, and that number went up in 2019. Groups like the boogaloos, Rise Above Movement, and white nationalist militias across the country are organizing, and so must we. Therefore, we need to equip our law enforcement officials, the FBI, and the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security with the tools necessary to identify, monitor, and prevent acts of violent terrorism. The bill before us today does just that. It establishes offices within the FBI, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Homeland Security and empowers them to coordinate their efforts with each other. It requires them to report to Congress twice a year on the assessment of the threats, ranking them and allocating the resources based on their assessed threats. Congress must, with a single voice, definitively state that if you or your group is plotting violence or taking weapons--be they guns or knives or otherwise--into a crowd to intimidate or coerce others to further your ideological goals, you are a terrorist and will be treated as such. This is not a partisan issue but one that affects all Americans' personal and economic security. This bill passed out of committee with bipartisan support overwhelmingly, 24-2. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' This bill will make a real difference. Again, I thank the chairman and the Speaker for bringing my bill to the House today. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Jordan), the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, Republicans denounce all violent extremism. Why won't the Democrats? Weeks ago in the committee, the Attorney General of the United States asked the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, asked the Democrats, why won't you speak out against the mob? Why won't you speak out against the violence that is taking place in our great cities all across the country this past summer? Guess what he got. Total, total silence. We have a bill on domestic terrorism, but a bill that barely mentions Antifa, one reference. Mr. Speaker, do you know why the one reference is in there? Because Republicans on the committee, through [[Page H4588]] Mr. Steube, offered an amendment in the committee. Not mentioned in the bill are two things that have happened in the last 30 days. The cold-blooded murder of a Trump supporter by an Antifa member was not mentioned in the resolution and is not mentioned in the bill. Not mentioned in the bill is the assassination attempt on two police officers sitting in their patrol car just 2 weeks ago. Let's condemn all violent extremism. Maybe they won't do that because, as my good friend from North Dakota said, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, the committee with that storied history of defending the rule of law, maybe because that individual said that Antifa is imaginary and that Antifa is a myth. Ask Andy Ngo that, Mr. Speaker. Ask the journalist who was attacked by Antifa a year ago. Ask the people in Portland, Oregon. For over 100 days, their city has been under siege. There has been a siege on the Federal court building there by Antifa, but one reference only in their legislation, and that is only there because Mr. Steube offered the amendment in committee. For over 100 days, this organization has been targeting the business owners, the people, and the residents in Portland, Oregon, and in other cities around our country. Democrats can call what has been happening to our cities all summer peaceful protests, but calling rioting, looting, and arson peaceful protests doesn't make it so. Let's condemn all of it. We should speak out against all domestic terrorism. We should denounce the violence--the rioting, the looting, and the arson--that is taking place in our cities. We should not have another political messaging bill, which is exactly what this is. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, would you share the time remaining, please. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Texas has 8 minutes remaining. The gentleman from North Dakota has 16 minutes remaining. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, let me thank my good friend from Ohio for bringing to our attention something that I think is very important. Then, it allows me to say that I don't know one single person in this body who condones violent protests. I have not run into anyone in the Judiciary Committee, and I have not seen anyone on the floor on either side of the aisle. That is why this legislation is so crucial because it generated bipartisan support on the work that the Congress should do. What is it that the Congress should do? Find a way for our agencies to work together. In the Judiciary Committee, we had a hearing with the Attorney General on the question of domestic terrorism. In the Homeland Security Committee, we had a hearing on the question of domestic terrorism. I think we found some, if you will, collegiality in recognizing that white supremacy and white nationalism were the greatest threat to domestic security. I remember in this legislation the generosity of Mr. Schneider and my commitment when the committee added Mr. Steube's--a Republican's-- amendment at markup that included findings that addressed antigovernment actors and violence against police. We passed that in a bipartisan way. I want to remind my colleagues that the legislation itself was passed in a bipartisan manner. We have seen what happens when we undermine coordination. We see what happens when the pandemic office was dismissed out of the White House that was coordinating with agencies on COVID-19 or other pandemics. We see the confusion that we have. This legislation is simply trying to make sure that our very fine public servants who are fighting domestic terrorism are fighting it with the best informational tools they can get. How do they do that? With this very fine legislation that allows us to be able to get the right kind of data. I want to just indicate a lot of things have been happening. I have watched peaceful protesters be subjected to violence. My heart goes out. Those are someone's children; they are young people; and they have a right to be protesting. They have a right, as our dear beloved colleague has always said, to speak up. John Robert Lewis always said to speak up and get into good trouble to make this Nation better. I have not heard any Member of this body not condemn, in the strongest terms, the shooting of Los Angeles deputies and are pleased to hear that they are recovering. I would just indicate that we need to adhere to what is right. This legislation is laying us on a pathway of getting facts and information so that we can do what is right to secure the American people. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker, I was in the committee when we did this and when we accepted Republican amendments and garnered some support from people on my side of the aisle in committee. I have no doubt that my friends on the other side of the aisle condemn all kinds of violence, but somewhere between committee and here things got added to the bill. Mr. Speaker, do you know what didn't get added? Not one mention of the horrific attack against two police officers shot at pointblank range in their patrol car. The bill did not mention the murder of a Trump supporter in Portland. But we did manage to mention the juvenile from Kenosha. So, while the gentlewoman says she supports a certain thing or nobody condones certain things, their actions on how this occurs show us where their priorities are. The priorities are political because we could have added all of these things. I find it interesting and odd on the same day that we are talking about due process, rights to effective assistance of counsel, justice for juveniles, and all the election integrity and voting, we don't condemn the burning down of the post office in Minneapolis. We don't talk about these other things, but we will make sure we mention a juvenile offender in Kenosha prior to any of his court hearings being held. We can talk about delaying justice and the administration of justice, but that is not how it reads in the bill, and that is not how it was spoken to on the floor. Mr. Speaker, if we are going to do this, all I ask is that we are consistent. The gentlewoman can stand here and say that we condemn all forms of violence, but only one made it into the bill after committee. That is because it fits a particular political narrative, and we have no interest in actually rooting out domestic terrorism wherever it exists. We want to make sure it fits a particular narrative. That is what this bill is about, and that is why we should oppose it. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. {time} 1515 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank the gentleman for his commentary, but I am going to rise and ask my colleagues to support this legislation in a bipartisan manner. As indicated--I would correct my friend's interpretation--Mr. Steube's amendment was added in the markup and the findings at that time addressed antigovernment actors and violence against police. We made it very clear, and it was bipartisan, that we condemn violence of any kind. But what I would say as well is that the simple addition as it relates to Kenosha was in sharp contrast to the visual, the video, of a direct skin contact shooting of an individual whose back was turned, and then the call across the Nation for white supremacists and white nationalists to come and defend. Defend what? There was law enforcement there. I think the governor had even asked for the Wisconsin National Guard to safeguard everyone. But here was someone that came--a teenager. I am grateful that he remained alive; grateful. But he walked with guns, and is alleged to have killed, harmed, three people at least, never was confronted by officers, of course, to our knowledge, and got home to sleep in his bed. On the other hand, Jacob Blake, whose father I met, wound up in ICU, wound up paralyzed, a victim in the Kenosha shootings. And so it is crucial that we get the facts of what this legislation wants to [[Page H4589]] do, and that we don't get a young man from Illinois versus another young man from Ohio, who was 12 years old--Tamir Rice--who didn't get to go home. We want to make sure that we have fairness. Mr. Speaker, as I said, I am very concerned about the shootings of these individuals, the Los Angeles deputies. We don't know the motives of the assailants. It remains unknown. But we continue to seek justice for them, and we want to make sure that the threat of white supremacists and domestic terrorism is known. Mr. Speaker, this bill directs that directly and I think it will provide for a very important tool for our law enforcement--unbiased-- without any effort to try and stigmatize anyone. Mr. Speaker, in closing, domestic terrorism is a serious threat to our country. We must take real action to address the rise of hate crimes and white supremacy. This legislation would address the rising tide of white supremacy without impinging on constitutional rights. It reflects a careful balance between empowering the investigatory agencies of the Federal Government to curb hateful and dangerous incidents of domestic terrorism and protecting the rights of free speech and assembly. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Brad Schneider for his leadership and his diligent work on this important legislation during this Congress. We will be better for the passage of this legislation. The Nation will be better. It is critical that we adopt this bill. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation, passed out of the Committee on the Judiciary in a bipartisan vote, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R 5602, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table."

DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, MEMBER, WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE: We are still knee deep in the first wave of this.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
DR. LAURA JARRETT, CNN ANCHOR: Anthony Fauci not holding back on the state of coronavirus in America and why it's surging right now.
Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. This is EARLY START. I'm Laura Jarrett.
CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN ANCHOR: Good morning, everyone. I'm Christine Romans. It's Tuesday, July 7th, 17 weeks. That's 119 days until the election. It is 5:00 a.m. this morning in New York.
And let's begin with this dire new assessment from the country's top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci laying bear about the rapid rise in coronavirus cases.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
FAUCI: We are still knee deep in the first wave of this. We went up, never came down to baseline, and now we're surging back up. So it's a serious situation that we have to address immediately. Now, a series of circumstances associated with various states and cities trying to open up in the sense of getting back to some form of normality has led to a situation where we have record-breaking cases.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ROMANS: Right now, 31 states are headed in the wrong direction with case numbers up from last week, 31 states. Nearly half the states are now rolling back or pausing their plans to reopen and ICU beds in hard-hit Florida and Texas are quickly filling up.
CNN's Nick Watt has the latest.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK WATT, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): On Independence Day Florida suffered more new cases than any state has ever. Still, the governor seems sanguine.
GOV. RON DESANTIS (R), FLORIDA: I mean, there's no need to really be fearful about it.
WATT: But some mayors are.
MAYOR FRANCIS SUAREZ (R), MIAMI: What's happening is what's happened across the country. You know, when we opened, you know, people began to socialize as if the coronavirus didn't exist.
WATT: Miami-Dade just closed dine-in restaurants again.
MAYOR DAN GELBER (D), MIAMI BEACH: We're starting to roll the carpet up. You know, it's pretty clear we have this real problem.
WATT: Because a staggering 26 percent of all COVID-19 tests in the county came back positive on Sunday.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I fear that we're spiraling out of control.
WATT: In Texas the number of patients in the hospital is hitting a new record high every day.
MAYOR RON NIRENBERG (I), SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS: If the case continues, we're -- we're a week away from rubbing out of hospital beds and ICU capacity.
WATT: Now, remember those Memorial Day crowds back in May? Well, three weeks later new case counts climbed nationally and 32 states are now going in the wrong direction. Did we learn a lesson? Well, this was Backwater Jacks in the Ozarks Memorial Day weekend and July 4th, almost indistinguishable.
There were crowds across the country this past weekend, too many drawn to water and a house party in L.A. and a beach party on Fire Island. So many celebrating shaking off the Brits but not this virus. Not even close.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're right back where we were at the peak of the epidemic during the New York outbreak.
WATT: And remember what New York looked like in April -- crowded hospitals, morgue trucks outside. Today, though, a different story.
GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D), NEW YORK: The numbers have actually declined since we started reopening.
WATT: They took it slow, mandated masks very early and harsh words for the president for not acknowledging the danger.
CUOMO: He is facilitating the virus. He is enabling the virus. How did this become a political statement? This is common sense. WATT (on camera): Here in California, case numbers have been rising at a record level. The number of people in the hospital is at a record level. We are just waiting and hoping that the death toll does not catch up with that.
The governor says that he is optimistic it won't because a lot of those people who are getting infected right now are younger and so less susceptible.
Nick Watt, CNN, Los Angeles.

JARRETT: Nick, thank you for that.
Health officials believe Arizona is days away from using crisis standards of care to treat coronavirus patients. That means hospitals will have to decide who gets care and who doesn't because there aren't just enough resources.
CNN has reporters across the country bringing you the very latest.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
EVAN MCMORRIS-SANTORO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I'm Evan McMorris Santoro in Phoenix.
Arizona passed a grim milestone Monday as authorities reported that for the first time since this pandemic began, the total number of cases here crossed 100,000. Over half of the infected are between 20 and 44, a number the Phoenix mayor worries could be due to early reopening.
[05:05:02]
That's our bars and gathering places, crowded with young people before being closed down again last week.
On Monday, another 3,300 cases were reported, as the pandemic continues to grow here.
WATT: I'm Nick Watt in Santa Monica, California. Now since the beginning of this COVID-19 pandemic, there has apparently been a huge spike in anti-Asian racial incidents here in California. A group called the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council has logged 800 such cases, among them 81 physical assaults.
Now, they say they want the governor to create a racial bias strike team. They say they've given them the tactics. Now, they want concrete action.
JASON CARROLL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I'm Jason Carroll in New York. West Virginia is now the latest state with a statewide policy on wearing some sort of a face covering. The executive order went into effect at midnight. Going forward, all people age 9 and older are required to wear a face covering at places indoors where social distancing is not possible.
The order does not apply to anyone who has trouble breathing or wearing a facemask covering without assistance. That according to Governor Jim Justice who announced the executive order on Monday. Penalties were not specified for those who do not follow the order. Governor Justice saying, quote: I know it's not the popular thing to do. He went on to say, it's the only thing we can do and it's the smart thing we can do.
BIANNA GOLODRYGA, CNN SENIOR GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York. Harvard and Princeton will welcome students back to campus this fall, the universities announced Monday. Harvard plans to bring up to 40 percent of undergraduates back to campus for the fall semester, including all first-year students.
Seniors would return for the spring semester, while first years would return home and learn remotely in the spring. However, classes will still be conducted entirely online, including for the students living on campus. Those living on campus will also be subjected to COVID-19 testing once they arrive followed by subsequent testing every three days. Princeton also announced a 10 percent reduction in undergraduate tuition for the school year. Harvard said they would not be adjusting their tuition rates.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
ROMANS: All right. Thanks to all our reporters for that.
International students pursuing degrees in the U.S. will have to leave the country or risk deportation if their universities switch to online classes this fall. This announcement by immigration and customs enforcement could affect thousands of foreign students. The agency suggests international students currently enrolled in the U.S. to consider transferring to schools with in-person instruction. There is an exception, however, for universities using a mix of online and in- person classes.
JARRETT: Yes, huge implications from that new rule.
Meanwhile, Florida State Department of Education is ordering local districts to open brick and mortar classrooms for the new school year starting in August. The department's emergency order cites the well- being of students and families and a return to Florida hitting its full economic stride. The order says school openings will have to be consistent with safety guidelines from state and local health officials. All of this as the CDC readies its new guidance for schools nationwide.
CNN's Nick Valencia has the latest on that.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Laura and Christine, there's still no exact timeline as to when the CDC plans to release this new guidance, but a senior official tells me that over the weekend, Director Robert Redfield was briefed on the recommendation and given the science to back that up. This official went on to tell me that schools need to be the first to open and the last to close, adding kids need to physically be in school.
The official's comments echo that of the American Pediatric Association which said last week that they strongly advocate that all policy considerations for the coming school year should start with the goal of having students physically present in school. This official at the CDC telling me that the task force there has made it a priority for the CDC this week. CNN has reached out to the CDC for official comment, as well as the White House Task Force.
We have yet to hear back -- Laura, Christine.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
ROMANS: All right. Nick, thank you for that.
Billions of dollars was spent in the paycheck protection program to help small businesses survive the coronavirus pandemic. A deep dive into the 4.8 million loans shows taxpayer money went to hair salons, restaurants, lobbyists, elite law firms, wealth managers, and even some members of Congress, of course, who own businesses.
Congressman Mike Kelly's car dealerships received three loans ranging up to $1 million. Tax money went to Congresswoman Vicky Hartzler's family farm supply business. Political groups like the Congressional Black Caucus and the politically connected media companies including Newsmax and ""The Washington Times"" also benefitted from the taxpayer loans. About 8 percent of the money went to the food and hotels sector which, of course, was slammed by the pandemic.
[05:10:02]
Taxpayer money also went to elite private schools, some private colleges and several arts organizations.
The program was the central pillar of the central stimulus package passed back in March. More than 130 billion was left unused when the program was closed last week. Lawmakers agreed to extend applications until August 8th. But more money is going to be needed. Senate Majority Mitch McConnell said Monday, Congress will need another relief bill as cases around the country rise. The clock is ticking because the House and Senate have alternating schedules. Congress will have to reach a deal between July 20th and July 31st.
JARRETT: Pretty amazing it went to the businesses of congressmen.
ROMANS: Yeah, exactly.
JARRETT: All right. Well, President Trump -- he is pushing racist appeals to his base, but this time not all of the typical allies are falling in line. That's next.
JARRETT: Well, President Trump is turning up the volume on racist appeals to his base, defending Confederate symbols and monuments, going after NASCAR's only black driver with false accusations, and casting racial justice protestors as criminals.
[05:15:12]
But this time as Trump leans in on his racist rhetoric, something new is happening.
Corporations, institutions, even top Republicans are distancing themselves from the president.
White House correspondent Jeremy Diamond has more now.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Today, President Trump ramping up his divisive and racially charged rhetoric. The president suggesting he disagrees with NASCAR's decision to ban the Confederate flag at its races and falsely accusing NASCAR's only black driver of orchestrating a hoax after a member of his team found a noose in his garage.
REPORTER: Why is the president even suggesting that Mr. Wallace should apologize?
KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Well, look, the FBI, as I noted, concluded that this was not a hate crime. And he believes it will go a long way if Bubba came out and acknowledged that as well.
DIAMOND: But Wallace did back on June 24th, saying he was relieved after the FBI determined the noose had been in the garage since last year. This afternoon, Wallace tweeted: Always deal with the hate being thrown at you with love, adding, even when it's hate from the president.
The White House press secretary also trying to claim that Trump was not expressing support for the Confederate flag.
MCENANY: I spoke to him this morning about this and he said he was not making a judgment one way or the other.
DIAMOND: South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a loyal Trump supporter, backing NASCAR's decision.
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): They're trying to grow the sport. The Confederate flag is not a good way to grow your business.
DIAMOND: And defending Wallace.
GRAHAM: Well, I don't think Bubba Wallace has anything to apologize for.
DIAMOND: Trump's tweet builds on the inflammatory rhetoric he delivered in a pair of Independence Day speeches, in which he painted racial injustice protesters as fascists, trying to end America as we know it. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Angry mobs are trying to tear down statues of our Founders, deface our most sacred memorials, and unleash a wave of violent crime in our cities.
We will never allow an angry mob to tear down our statues, erase our history, indoctrinate our children, or trample on our freedoms.
DIAMOND: After trying to recast his fight to protect Confederate monuments as an attempt to --
TRUMP: Protect and preserve our history, our heritage, and our great heroes.
DIAMOND: -- the president's race-based appeals unmasked by his own tweets, signaling a campaign strategy to stoke fear among white Americans, just like in 2016.
(on camera): So it's clear that the president is, indeed, diving back into that 2016 playbook dividing Americans along racial and cultural lines, but it's also clear that the president is swimming against the currents more than ever before, appealing to a smaller and smaller slice of the American electorate.
Beyond NASCAR, we also saw just last week Mississippi removing the Confederate battle flag from its state flag and political attitudes in terms of racial injustice in America are also quickly changing. Recent polls have shown that about 2/3 of Americans support the protests in the wake of George Floyd's death and only about 1/3 of Americans believe that President Trump is handling race relations adequately.

ROMANS: All right. Thanks for that.
In a move that could put the pentagon on a collision course with President Trump, defense officials are thinking of banning the Confederate flag from U.S. military bases. A defense official tells CNN, military lawyers are reviewing the plan and a decision could come soon. The president has been clear in his support for Confederate moments and symbols. It is unknown if the Defense Secretary Mark Esper will seek the president's approval for the ban.
JARRETT: It seems unlikely they would go against the commander-in- chief but we'll see what happens on that.
All right. Still ahead, setbacks for sports teams trying to get back on the field during this pandemic. ""Bleacher Report"" is up next.
[05:23:37]
ROMANS: All right. Major League Baseball releases its schedule for the upcoming season despite several teams shutting down their workouts over coronavirus testing concerns.
Andy Scholes has more on this morning's ""Bleacher Report"".
Hey, Andy.
ANDY SCHOLES, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, good morning, Christine.
You know, we're seeing how difficult this new world is for sports, as teams try to get back on the field. The Astros, Nationals, and Cardinals all had to cancel workouts yesterday because they said Major League Baseball's testing wasn't fast enough. So, the players were all tested for COVID-19 on Friday. They still didn't have the results Monday mornings, so they canceled yesterday's workouts.
Major League Baseball responded, condemning the teams for cancelling workouts and said they have addressed the delays caused by the holiday weekend. Opening day for baseball is going to be July 23rd.
Major League Soccer will be down a team as they try to return to action this week. For the MLS's back tournament in Disney, FC Dallas had ten players and one staff member test positive for coronavirus. So they have been removed from the tournament which begins tomorrow.
The NHL and its players, meanwhile, reaching a tentative agreement to resume play August 1st. Teams are going to open camp next week. They're going to be playing in two hub cities yet to be announced.
The PGA tour, meanwhile, changing course, announcing fans will not be allowed at the Memorial Tournament next week in Ohio.
[05:25:02]
This was to be the first event with fans, but the PGA saying due to the rapidly changing dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic, the tournament would have to cancel those original plans.
All right. Basketball star Dwight Howard says he will join the Lakers when the NBA season restarts in Orlando later this month. The veteran center telling CNN's Don Lemon that he'll donate the remainder of his salary, reportedly $700,000, to social injustice initiatives through his Breathe Again Foundation.

DWIGHT HOWARD, LOS ANGELES LAKERS CENTER: I'm going to use my salary, all the money that, you know, the paychecks that I would be getting from going down in the bubble to help push this Breathe Again -- push our movement and just make sure that people don't forget about what's going on in our society.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
SCHOLES: Yes. LeBron James and the Lakers are scheduled to fly as a team from L.A. to Orlando on Thursday. The NBA season scheduled to start July 30th. All right. And, finally, well, there is at least one person having a great 2020. Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes signing the richest deal in sports history yesterday. According to multiple reports, the record-breaking contract extension could be worth up to a staggering $503 million over 10 years. The 24-year-old led the Chiefs to their first Super Bowl title in 50 years last season.
Here's a list of the richest deals in U.S. sports. Mahomes' half billion dollar deal just dwarfs the $426 million deal that Mike Trout signed with the Angels last year.
And, you know, Laura, there's a couple other guys smiling this morning as well. The Ravens' Jackson and Texans' Watson looking at that Mahomes deal because they're up next in terms of signing a big contract extension as quarterbacks in the NFL. So as you can imagine, they got pretty big smiles on their face seeing that deal yesterday.
JARRETT: Yes, at 24 years old, that's not bad.
All right. Andy, nice to see you this morning. Thanks so much.
SCHOLES: All right.

The Rev. Al Sharpton demanded more action against police brutality.
HOUSTON -- George Floyd died at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis. A thousand miles to the south, in the Texas city where he was raised, two rows of police officers saluted as his coffin went past. 
 Hours before Mr. Floyd's funeral began at a southwest Houston church, uniformed officers stood between the hearse and the front doors. As relatives and friends pushed the gold coffin with blue trimming into the church, the officers raised their hands in a show of respect.
 Mr. Floyd's funeral and the public viewing that preceded it a day earlier have been a counterpoint to the fury that his death touched off in cities across America. Mr. Floyd, who grew up in a tough public housing complex in Houston's predominantly black Third Ward, was considered a native son, and the tone adopted by protesters, activists, elected officials and police officers has been one of honoring a grieving Houston family.
 Inside the Fountain of Praise church, Mr. Floyd, 46, the emblem of an international movement whose name has been chanted by thousands of people since his death, was remembered as the son, brother, uncle and father that he was in life.
 George Perry Floyd Jr. was born in North Carolina but grew up in the Cuney Homes housing complex in Houston. He was a 1993 graduate of Jack Yates High School, where he played on the basketball team as a 6-foot-6 power forward ''able to dunk with both hands.'' And he was a father of five and grandfather of two, according to the funeral program.
 His relatives referred to him as ''Superman.''
 ''The world knows George Floyd,'' said Kathleen McGee, one of his aunts, surrounded by relatives, all dressed in white. ''I know him as Perry Jr. He was a pesky little rascal, but we all loved him.''
 Like the funerals of Michael Brown and Eric Garner in 2014, Mr. Floyd's funeral became a moment of both national reckoning and mourning, as black leaders and Mr. Floyd's family celebrated his life and denounced the brutality of his death.
 The funeral aired live on broadcast and cable television, and as it began at noon, the New York Stock Exchange went silent for eight minutes, 46 seconds -- the length of time a Minneapolis police officer held Mr. Floyd's neck under his knee before he died. It was the longest moment of silence on the stock exchange floor in its 228-year history.
 In Houston, speaker after speaker invoked the political moment born out of what happened in Minneapolis.
 ''This was not just a tragedy. It was a crime,'' said the Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights leader who delivered the eulogy.
 ''We must commit to this family -- all of these families, all of his children, grandchildren and all -- that until these people pay for what they did, that we're going to be there with them,'' Mr. Sharpton said. ''Because lives like George's will not matter until somebody pays the cost for taking their lives.''
 He admonished the country's political and business leaders for belatedly saying they were sorry for the mistreatment of African-Americans. ''Don't apologize -- give Colin Kaepernick a job back,'' he said, referring to the former N.F.L. quarterback. ''We don't want an apology. We want him repaired.''
 The service came after five days of public memorials in Minneapolis, North Carolina and Houston, and two weeks after the Minneapolis police officer was caught on video making the arrest that ended Mr. Floyd's life.
 On Monday, a public viewing in Houston drew nearly 6,400 people, including Gov. Greg Abbott, nurses fresh from work dressed in scrubs, new fathers holding babies and Mr. Floyd's high school classmates. Following Tuesday's service, he was to be buried at the Houston Memorial Gardens in a grave next to his mother, Larcenia Floyd, who died in 2018.
 In a video message, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, offered his condolences to the family, saying he understood the weight of grieving in public. Mr. Biden, who has often connected to people through grief after suffering deep losses in his own life, spent time with the Floyd family in private on Monday.
 ''No child should have to ask the question that too many black children have had to ask for generations: 'Why? Why is Daddy gone?''' Mr. Biden said in the video. ''When there is justice for George Floyd, we will truly be on our way to racial justice in America.''
 Mayor Sylvester Turner of Houston announced from the altar that he would sign an executive order on Tuesday to ban police chokeholds and strangleholds. Among other things, the order would also require police officers to give a warning before shooting.
 ''We honor him today because when he took his last breath, the rest of us will now be able to breathe,'' said Mr. Turner, who is black.
 No one mentioned President Trump, but Representative Al Green, Democrat of Texas, said that the next person in the country's highest office needed to tackle racial inequality. And Brooklyn Williams, a young niece of Mr. Floyd's, called for an end to hate crimes.
 ''Someone said, 'Make America great again,' but when has America ever been great?'' she said. ''America, it is time for a change!''
 Mr. Sharpton began his eulogy with a warning that people -- especially elected officials -- tend to forget about police killings before officers have been brought to trial. Often, he said, bad police officers are ''protected by wickedness in high places.''
 The officer who pressed his knee into Mr. Floyd's neck, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He and three other officers who participated in the arrest have been fired, and the other men were arrested on lesser charges.
 Mr. Sharpton promised to be back in Minneapolis when the trial starts, and to march on Washington ''by the tens of thousands'' on the anniversary of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s ''I Have a Dream'' speech in August.
 One by one, Mr. Sharpton named the relatives of other black men and women whose killings have invoked concerns over racial injustice and asked them to stand. Other mourners stood, too, until everyone in the sanctuary was up and clapping and the funeral of one man briefly became a funeral for all the other lives lost.
 ''The mother of Trayvon Martin, will you stand,'' he said. ''The mother of Eric Garner, will you stand. The sister of Botham Jean, will you stand. The family of Pamela Turner, here in Houston, will you stand. The father of Michael Brown from Ferguson, Mo., will you stand. The father of Ahmaud Arbery, will you stand.
 ''All of these families came to stand with this family because they know better than anyone else the pain they will suffer from the loss that they have gone through,'' Mr. Sharpton said.
 Most mourners and public officials attending the funeral wore face masks. But the coronavirus pandemic at times seemed an afterthought. Among the hundreds of people inside the sanctuary and outside in the parking lot, people hugged, shook hands and passed funeral programs and business cards.
 ''I see that you all have destroyed all laws of social distancing,'' joked the Rev. William Lawson, pastor emeritus of Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church in Houston.
 After the service, Mr. Floyd's body was carried out of the church toward the final, private observances at the cemetery. His body was borne by horse-drawn carriage along the final stretch of the route, with the public permitted to gather along the roadside and watch.
 ''You called for Mama,'' Mr. Sharpton said during his eulogy. ''We're going to lay your body next to hers.''
 A group of activists and Houston-area residents stood outside the church throughout the funeral -- a much smaller gathering than the thousands who flocked to the church on Monday for the visitation.
 Before the service began, a young man and woman walked up to the bouquets of flowers left by mourners at the church's front doors, beneath a framed picture of Mr. Floyd. They knelt and prayed, and the young man raised his fist high.
 The man, Arion Ford, 27, a community organizer from the St. Louis area who is a friend of the Floyd family, choked back tears as he stood up.
 ''I was praying for Mr. Floyd,'' Mr. Ford said. ''In my mind, I'm thinking, that could be my father, that could be my cousin, my brother. It could happen to any one of us. We are fed up, as you see out on the streets.''
 His friend, Trisha Boyle, 29, a community activist also from St. Louis, said Mr. Floyd's death had started a movement.
 ''We go to school,'' she said. ''I have two master's degrees. Arion is studying to be a lawyer. We do the American dream. There's this one piece that's missing -- we're murdered. We're murdered if we're jogging. We're murdered if we just so happen to have a counterfeit bill. Is that a death penalty?''
 Later, as Mr. Floyd's coffin was wheeled out of the church, a man standing in the back of the group of onlookers shouted, ''We will breathe!'' Another yelled, ''Get your knee off our neck!''
 The two rows of police officers stood to the side. As the coffin was lifted into the hearse, a chant broke out: ''Say his name! George Floyd! Say his name! George Floyd!''

NEW YORK, Sept 28 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Lesbian, gay and bisexual people are much more likely than straight people to get migraines, U.S. research showed on Monday, indicating sexual orientation may be a risk factor for the painful and disabling headaches.
Nearly one third of lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) participants experienced migraines, 58% more than did heterosexual participants, in a survey by the University of California - San Francisco (UCSF) published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Neurology.
Overall, more than one in six people in the United States experience migraine headaches, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Severe headache pain from migraines, one of the most common reasons for a hospital emergency room visit, can be accompanied by sensitivity to light and sound as well as blurred vision, nausea and vomiting.
The researchers said while their work shows LGB Americans are at greater risk for migraines, they could not pinpoint the reasons why.
""There might be a higher rate of migraines in LGB people because of discrimination, stigma or prejudice, which may lead to stress and trigger a migraine,"" the study's lead author Dr. Jason Nagata, an assistant professor of pediatrics at UCSF, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
""Physicians should be aware that migraines are quite common in LGB individuals and assess for migraine symptoms,"" Nagata said.
Hate crimes against LGBT+ people have slightly risen in recent years, according to the most recent data from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation.
There was a total of 1,130 reported crimes based on sexual orientation in the United States from 2014 to 2017. The majority of the incidents targeted gay men.
LGB people may be at higher risk for migraines also due to barriers of receiving health care, Nagata added.
Migraines can be disabling and result in missed work and frequent doctor visits.
Other studies have shown disparities in migraine prevalence by gender, ethnicity and socioeconomic status.
As many as 85% of Americans who suffer from migraines are women, according to the Migraine Research Foundation, a U.S. based nonprofit that researches migraine treatments.
Migraines appear to be more common among Black Americans and Americans with lower socioeconomic status, according to the National Headache Foundation, a U.S. based nonprofit that raises awareness about headache and migraine pain.
The new study surveyed nearly 10,000 Americans ages 31 to 42 from 2016 to 2018.

JACOBS Criminologists have long recognized that retaliatory violence diffuses outward from discrete conflicts, often in contagion-like fashion. No understanding of the source of this spread is possible without first documenting the modalities that fuel it. Retalia- tion has variation, and it is important to catalog that variation if the concept of crime as social control is to be more effectively understood. Drawing from in-depth inter- views with 33 street offenders, and using qualitative techniques of analytic induction, constant comparison, and domain analysis, this article offers a typology of retaliation to refine understandingof aprocessthat at present,remainsonly loosely developed. Keywords: retaliation; violence; social control Retaliation is a potent regulator of offender conduct, arguably the most potent form of social control. Formal sanctions typically carry little deterrent value, but the prospect of being wronged for a wrong you yourself committed is far more certain, and its consequences more severe. Retaliation is a power- ful testament to the norm of reciprocity--a norm that holds every action should yield an equal and opposite reaction (Gouldner 1960). Such reactions may be extralegal, but ""rough justice"" (Baron, Forde, and Kennedy 2001) is more effective precisely because grievants, not external actors or institutions, are responsible for righting perceived wrongs. The street criminal underworld is a context where law is unavailable as a matter of course. Criminals lose legal protections when violated and must retaliate to restore balance. The importance of self-help is amplified by the ""code of the street,"" a set of normative concerns that prescribes appropriate conduct in the face of conflict (Anderson 1999). At the core of the code is respect--getting it, maintaining it, and enhancing it. This can be accom- plished in a number of ways, but how one reactsto an affront isdeterminative. I would like to thank Eric Baumer, Bob Bursik, Ted Chiricos, Jennifer Jacobs, Rick Rosenfeld, Gordon Waldo, Richard Wright, and several anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments and criticisms. I also would like to acknowledge the support of Noah and Grant Jacobs. Please address correspondenceto Bruce Jacobs, Schoolof Social Sciences, University of Texas-Dallas, Richardson, TX 75083-0688. JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY, Vol. 41 No. 3, August 2004 295-323 DOI: 10.1177/0022427803262058 © 2004 Sage Publications 295 To let a transgression ""slide,"" even one that is trivial, more often than not sig- nals weakness. It demonstrates that you are soft, that you can be exploited with impunity. Adversaries must be faced down and put in their proper place, lest you be labeled a ""chump"" (Anderson 1999; Horowitz 1983; Wolfgang and Ferracuti 1967). Alerting the authorities is not a realistic option even if it were a desired one. Calling the police conveys the impression that you cannot take care of business yourself. It also labels you a ""snitch,"" and in street culture, there are few worse statuses (Rosenfeld, Jacobs, and Wright 2003). The police are widely thought to be ineffective anyway. They rarely are around when dis- putes erupt. They take too long to respond. Their response makes little dif- ference in the trajectory of a dispute. More troubling, the police often are perceived--at least by street offenders--to be hostile to real justice. They reportedly detain people for little reason, hassle suspects in their charge, plant evidence, use excessive force, and fail to give ""breaks"" when they could (Rosenfeld et al. 2003; see also Anderson 1999; Miller 1996). Such per- ceptions foment disrespect for the rule of law, promoting an atmosphere that strengthens the oppositional culture and its reliance on self-help (see Anderson 1999). Despite the preeminence of self-help in settings beyond the law, the man- ner in which criminal-grievants express their retaliatory impulses remains poorly specified. No understanding of retaliation's role in the spread of urban violence is possible without first cataloging its variation and possible reasons for it. A typology would help to accomplish this goal. The present article offers one with this in mind. The Retaliation Literature The criminological literature on retaliation is surprisingly scant-- surprising insofar as most social control is informal and many crimes are moralistic (Black 1983; Katz 1988). Retaliation represents the obvious inter- section between informal social control and moralism. It is, to use Black's (1983) elegant phrase, ""crime as social control."" Extant studies are largely descriptive and examine reprisal tangentially to other dynamics relevant to offender groups and settings (see, e.g., Cromwell et al. 1991; Decker and Van Winkle 1996; Jacobs 2000; Luckenbill 1977; Meier, Kennedy, and Sacco 2001). These studies do not explore retaliation's essential variation, nor do they attempt to organize it in any systematic way. When retaliation is exam- ined in itsown right, itssituatedcomposition is less important than the factors that mediate the availability of law (Black 1983; Horwitz 1990). Retaliation is represented more broadly in studies of formal organizations (Rothschild and Miethe 1999), gender (Schnake et al. 1997), children (Herzberger and 296 JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY Hall 1993), domestic violence (Marleau and Hamilton 1999), racism (Craig 1999), terrorism (Brophy-Baermann and Conybeare 1994), and experimen- tal psychology (see, e.g., DeRidder et al. 1999; Kim et al. 1998). But its struc- ture, process, and contingent forms remain poorly understood. Retaliation as an act of social control may be conceptually generic, but particular retributive modalities unfold in particular circumstances. In the abstract, reprisal by street criminals will always be immediate. Cowering in the moment is not an option, and no amount of retrospective interpretation deflects the stigma from an unjustified surrender. Reflexivity becomes even more important when an audience is present--third parties are the final arbi- ters of status (Wilkinson and Fagan 2001:174)--and when violators are prone to talk. Word on the street travels fast, and the reputational damage can be serious and long-lasting. But the abstract and reality are not always consonant, and delays separat- ing the response from the affront are a significant possibility. The affront may not involve face-to-face contact. The affront may involve contact, but the vio- lator may be able to escape. The violation may not involve contact, and the violator may be unknown to the grievant. Information about the violator's identity or whereabouts might not emerge until well after the affront, if at all. Information might emerge, but the grievant may be unable to catch the viola- tor in a sufficiently compromising position to make retaliation possible. The grievant might be unable to generate sufficient coercive power relative to the violator or find him/herself in a setting unsuitable for retaliation. The grievant may desire to retaliate but face costs and risks (e.g., foregone crimi- nal wages, chance of arrest) that are too high to justify a strike at the moment it is contemplated. Violators take specific actions to amplify the prospect of deferment. Not infrequently, they target people who do not know them, they wear disguises to thwart the possibility of being tracked down, they alternatively lay low and exercise mobility to make detection more difficult, and they maintain a high degree of vigilance and defensibility to head off a retaliatory strike if and when it comes (see Jacobs, Topalli, and Wright 2000). Desiring to retaliate and consummating the act are two different things, so despite the discourse about immediacy, situational factors can make it more talk than real. Delays and uncertainty are significant because affronts attack identity rather than some economic or political utility (Gabriel 1998; Greenberg 1993; Miller 2001). It is because injustice threatens identity that grievants experience it as so disturbing: When ""maintaining or re-establishing justice, [grievants are] actually maintain[ing] or re-establish[ing their] identities"" (Wenzel 2001:331). This is especially true in street culture, where minor affronts assume major prominence. Strikes that are delayed or that do not involve face-to-face contact threaten reputational damage in excess of that Jacobs / STREET CRIMINAL RETALIATION 297 created by the violation itself. How grievants effect retaliatory modalities with this dilemma in mind is of interest. Drawing from in-depth interviews with 33 street offenders, and using qualitative techniques of analytic induction, constant comparison, and domain analysis (Spradley 1980; Strauss 1987), this article offers a descrip- tive typology of retaliation that specifies reprisal's various forms against a backdrop of relevant constraints. Retaliationhas variation, and it is important to catalog this variation if the concept of crime as social control is to be more effectively understood. Criminologists have long recognized that retaliatory violence diffuses outward from discrete conflicts, often in contagion-like fashion (Loftin 1985). No understanding of the source of this spread is possi- ble without first documenting the modalities that fuel it. Conceptual Context Retaliation is a type of ""coercive action"" (Tedeschi and Felson 1994). As such, it evolves in three distinct stages: naming, claiming, and aggression (Luckenbill and Doyle 1989). Naming occurs when there is a ""perception or recognition of harm from another's behavior."" Claiming ""transforms the perceived injurious experience into a dispute"" (Baron, Forde, and Kennedy 2001:663), typically by demanding reparation from the wrongdoer. Aggres- sion results when the aggrieved party decides to use force to resolve the dis- pute (Luckenbill and Doyle 1989). In settings where normative support of violence is strong, claiming may be bypassed in favor of outright aggression (see Luckenbill and Doyle 1989 on the notion of ""disputatiousness""). Retaliation is an informal sanction that involves both punishment and deterrence--punishment in the sense of ""payback"" for a past wrong, deter- rence in the sense of inhibiting future transgressions by the violator or other potential violators. Like any social control device, retaliation represents a response to deviance (Goode 1997). Social control is penal, compensatory, conciliatory, or therapeutic (Black 1993), but the end goal is always the same: to respond to behavior in ways that maximize social order. Informal social control has long occupied a central place in deterrence theory. Analysts argue that would-be offenders contemplate the social costs of rule-breaking (shame, guilt, embarrassment, loss of social standing) and decide it is in their best interest not to offend. Bishop (1984:405) concludes that informal sanctions may be the ""real deterrent and that formal punish- ment is important only insofar as it triggers [them]"" (see also Zimring and Hawkins 1973; for a nice overview, also see Brown, Esbensen, and Geis 1996). As an informal sanction, retaliation is distinct from more traditional emo- tive forces like shame, guilt, and embarrassment. The latter requires a cogni- 298 JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY tive presence in the mind of the would-be offender. Retaliation is actual pun- ishment, a physical act experienced only after it is delivered (Jacobs, Topalli, and Wright 2000). Though the fear of retaliation does introduce the possibil- ity of a cognitive deterrent to wrongdoing, this fear is less salient among street criminals relative to other offenders because violence is routine, and fatalism reduces worry: The threat of retaliation is assumed. It is part of ""the game."" Its risk can be managed. If the risk becomes unmanageable, offenders simply cease to think about it. Fatalism is liberating by taking at least some of the power away from fear (on fatalism and its role in releasing worry, see Jacobs 2000; Miller 1958). Retaliation may more closely resemble a formal sanction than certain informal ones by virtue of its external sourcing and threats of physical inca- pacitation or material deprivation (Jacobs, Topalli, and Wright 2000). The harm accruing from retaliatory acts can rival or exceed even the most severe forms of official punishment. Formal systems of criminal justice arose, in part, because vigilantism was disproportionate to the affronts that incited street justice. Retaliation occurs in the service of justice but is guided by the principle of revenge. Justice and revenge can be at odds when identity-defense anchors the retributive process. Strikes in defense of identity tend to be excessive, which is understandable in settings where affronts are considered blows to character. But revenge ""has its own moral imperative"" and in seeking it, grievants believe they are doing justice (Bies and Tripp 1996:258; see also Bies and Tripp 2001). The objective of justice-seeking, however, is to get even, and the objective of identity-defense is to win (Tedeschi and Felson 1994). Winning requires that grievants exact severe harm against violators. In ""an irrational, Nietzschean way . . . [grievants seek] to humiliate and oblit- erate [the violator] . . . , as if their own vitality derives from the . . . humilia- tions . . . they inflict . . . "" (Gabriel 1998:1349). The point is that retaliation may be grounded ""objectively"" in the norm of reciprocity, but reciprocity has a subjective dimension when it occurs within the confines of punitive social control. Exploring the nexus between punishment, identity-defense, and social control permits our understanding of this understudied informal sanction to be refined. METHOD Data for this study were drawn from in-depth qualitative interviews with 33 active offenders recruited from the streets of St. Louis, Missouri. Inter- views took place in summer 2001 and summer 2002. The mean age of respondents was 26.6 (the median was 25.5). A total of 25 respondents were Jacobs / STREET CRIMINAL RETALIATION 299 male, 8 were female; respondents, on average, had completed 11.6 years of formal education; 17 of the 33 respondents claimed to work in some capac- ity; 25 respondents reported having children, 8 did not; 2 of the 33 respon- dents were married. All respondents were African American. Respondents were recruited with the help of a specially trained, and com- pensated, project fieldworker. This person, an active offender himself (also interviewed as part of the 33), assisted the author in several previous projects over the course of three years, demonstrating his reliability each time. The fieldworker recruited individuals whom he knew to be involved in street cul- ture and crime (friends, associates, acquaintances) and asked them to partici- patein an interview. There were no formal eligibilitycriteriabeyond this. The type of activities in which respondents participated ranged widely, from assault to property crime to (episodic) drug use and/or dealing. The author chose not to reveal the specific study protocol or interview questionnaire to the fieldworker prior to initiating recruitment for fear it would give inter- viewees the opportunity to craft their responses to meet the needs of the study.1 All the respondents, however, had in fact experience with retaliation, some of it quite extensive and recent. These experiences comprised the focus of the interviews. Interviews were tape-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and semistructured, but allowed for considerable probing. The intention was for interviews to flow much like a conversation, to elicitthe ""thick description"" necessary for a study of this nature. Some respondents were a bit apprehensive at first, but most quickly relaxed and became quite conversational. Promises of anonym- ity and confidentiality undoubtedly helped, as did the ""word"" of the field- worker that everything was ""cool."" In criminological field research, the gate- keeper's importance should not be underestimated (Walker and Lidz 1977). The fieldworker had a solid reputation and an established track record of working successfully with the author. The author himself is well-regarded in the circles of offenders from which the fieldworker recruits. Respon- dents knew they would not be ""burned"" by speaking with me, and this seemed to put them at ease. A modest sum of $50 was provided to encourage participation. A number of specific measures were used to enhance the data's internal validity. The author never asked for respondents' real names, only street names, which are sufficiently generic not to identify anyone in particular. The author assured interviewees that their transcripts would be held in strict confidence. The author emphasized (to respondents who appeared to be especially wary) the importance of being sincere; their comments could end up in a book or article, so it was criticalto ""get it right."" Past experience work- ing with offenders suggested this to be an effective strategy. The author moni- 300 JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY tored the veracity of responses by probing for inconsistent answers, and by asking respondents to clarify ambiguous statements. Internal validity is always problematic in the absence of watching offend- ers do what it is they report, but this is not possible for obvious legal, ethical, and practical reasons. The validity and reliability of offender self-reports, however, have been examined by a number of scholars, all of whom suggest that in-depth interviews are an excellent method for generating valuable data (see e.g., Elliott and Ageton 1980; Erickson and Empey 1963; Nye and Short 1956). This is not to say that offenders never misrepresent what they do, but rather that deception is far less rampant than many analysts might presume (see Fleisher 1995). As for external validity, the representativeness of a purposively drawn sample of offenders cannot be determined conclusively because the parame- ters of the population are unknown (Glassner and Carpenter 1985; Wright and Decker 1994). Though all of these respondents were recruited by the same fieldworker, offenders in this research setting tend to be quite mobile, which enhances the likelihood thatany purposively drawn sample willtap the diversity of multiple networks. Criminal networks vary in structure, density, and breadth, so this is important for improving generalizability within this research setting and perhaps beyond it as well. Though it would be unreasonable to claim that any fieldworker could achieve theoretical saturation with a sample of 33, there is no cause to believe that these respondents are unique or different from offenders examined in other studies of street crime (see Hochstetler [2001] on this point). Re- sponses did become repetitious, suggesting sufficient thematic coverage, though it is conceivable that repetition was an artifact of the research design itself. I have made reasonable effort to present quotes from a variety of respondents, but selectivity is an unavoidable part of research of this kind (Wright and Decker 1997). This isespeciallytrue because not allrespondents were asked the exact same questions or in the exact same order, because inter- views became shorter and questions fewer as the research progressed (owing to my desire to focus more systematically on issues raised earlier in the pro- cess, such as the role of timing and contact in strikes), and because some respondents inevitably are more candid or articulate than others. Necessarily, this research must be considered exploratory in nature. A Typology of Criminal Retaliation Qualitative techniques of analytic induction, constant comparison, and domain analysis (Spradley 1980; Strauss 1987) revealed the importance of two axial factors around which retaliatory strikes can best be understood: Whether such strikes occur immediately after the affront, and whether the Jacobs / STREET CRIMINAL RETALIATION 301 strikes involve face-to-face contact with the person responsible for the affront. Immediate reprisal that involves face-to-face contact will be called reflexive retaliation. Immediate reprisal that involves no face-to-face contact will be called reflexively displaced retaliation.2 When retaliation is delayed, an added contingency is introduced--whether or not the delay is desired by the retaliating party. This permits four additional possibilities. Face-to-face retaliation where the delay is desired is called calculated retaliation. Face-to- face retaliation where the delay is not desired is called deferred retaliation. Retaliation without face-to-face contact where the delay is desired is called sneaky retaliation. Retaliation without face-to-face contact with the violator where the delay is undesired by the retaliating party is called imperfect retali- ation. For the sake of clarity, these different types are presented as distinct entities, but this is not meant to impose an artificial degree of clarity on cate- gories that can fade into one another over time. The various branches of this decision-tree and its assorted pathways are depicted schematically in Figure 1. Reflexive Retaliation Reflexive retaliation is face-to-face retribution that occurs immediately after an affront takes place. It is a knee-jerk response, in the moment. Of all 302 JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY Affront Retaliation Immediate Delayed Immediate Delayed Delay desired Delay undesired Delay desired Delay undesired Reflexive Calculated Deferred Without face-to-face contact Reflexively displaced Sneaky Imperfect Non retaliation With face-to-face contact Figure 1 types, this one best fits the commonsense understanding of what street justice is all about. Somebody wrongs you and you wrong them right back, immedi- ately, without hesitation. In the words of Wilkinson and Fagan (2001:190), cognition moves rapidly from ""cold"" to ""hot,"" and decision flows directly into action. Reflexive strikes generally assume that the affront itself involves face-to-face contact. Without such contact, the aggrieved party might not know who the violator is or how she or he can be found. Both would create a delay. Reflexive retaliation is an outgrowth of the imperatives of street culture, imperatives that emphasize spontaneous action and instant gratification to the exclusion of almost everything else (see Shover 1996). Waiting also makes you look afraid, and fear is not something you ever want to show. Lashing out is much better. Intolerance gets you respect and makes you look strong. Strength is protective. Chewy thus beat a man into submission after the man chastised Chewy for engaging a woman in street conversation--ostensibly for the purpose of ""picking her up."" The man claimed the woman was his wife, but she was not. This claim in itself did not appear sufficient to trigger Chewy's ire, but the violator's tenor and language was: He started talking noise . . . calling me a punk and stuff . . . weak . . . I just upped on him . . . I hit him a couple of times and then I grabbed him, threw him on the ground and was on top of his hand. I busted it up. Then I started hitting him in his chest, you know, punking him. When the affront involves physical abuse, quick and forceful reactions become even more important. Black was struck from behind by an associate after making disparaging sexual remarks about the associate's sister. The blow was unexpected, occurred in front of an audience, was violent where Black's violation was verbal, and because it occurred from behind, was, in Black's words, ""cowardly shit."" Black responded with a punch. A fight ensued, but Black reportedly was unable to deliver the punishment he felt was justified. He struck again two days later, this time in calculated fashion (detailed shortly). Though Black obviously committed the violation that trig- gered the affront that in turn led him to retaliate, disputes often escalate. Con- flicts build sequentially and retaliation tends to breed counter-retaliation (see, e.g., Luckenbill 1977; Meier, Kennedy, and Sacco 2001; Wolfgang 1958). Disputes escalate, but they also have a tendency to draw others in. Even otherwise ""neutral"" parties might be required to respond through self-help to a ""beef"" that was not theirs but that became theirs as events unfolded. Such was the case with Lafonz, who found himself embroiled in conflict during a Jacobs / STREET CRIMINAL RETALIATION 303 neighborhood basketball game. A man called a foul on one of Lafonz's asso- ciates (one of the man's opponents in the game). The associate claimed the call was picky. An angry exchange of words followed, drawing in a second associate as well as a friend of the man who made the call. A fight erupted. Short of stature and slight of build, the associates were sorely outmatched, and Lafonz reportedly felt it necessary to intervene on their behalf. Lafonz's ""altruistic"" act, however, was very much rooted in self-interest. If he failed to provide backup, word would have gotten back to the neighborhood that he had pulled a ""bitch move,"" thereby sullying his reputation: Because we all friends, you know what I'm saying? It's like I can't let you get beat up and just sit there and watch it . . . It'd just be . . . that'd be a bitch move . . . it'd have made me look bad . . . we from the same neighborhood and if I sit there and let these two grown-ass men beat these two little dudes' ass that's gonna look bad on me. Given their presupposed importance to the enactment of street justice, more vital than explaining why reflexive strikes occurred is why they did not. The data suggest that either the opportunity to strike reflexively was not pres- ent, the situational context made it illogical, or grievants wanted to wait for strategic reasons. One such reason was to cultivate the element of surprise. Calculated strikes illustrate this strategy best. Calculated Retaliation Calculated retaliation is face-to-face retribution that is delayed where the delay is desired by the retaliating party. Typically, delays are an outgrowth of the grievant's attempt to secure a competitive advantage over the violator. The grievant wants the violator to believe as if the affront has been forgiven, that he or she wants to ""move on."" This is done to cultivate the element of sur- prise. The data suggest that grievants generally know who the violator is and have a pretty good idea of how to find him or her, so the strategy comes down to waiting to attack until the moment is right. Getting an opponent to lower his or her guard is perhaps the best strategy for seizing the upper hand in a predatory encounter--retaliatory or other- wise. Stalking the violator openly, or letting him or her know that you are still mad and out to get him or her, tips your hand and permits him or her to pre- vent the retaliatory strike, or to mount a preemptive strike of his or her own. Waiting and then acting by surprise later also permits the grievant to erase any competitive advantage the violator might have at the moment the affront occurs, an advantage that may have prevented the grievant from retaliating 304 JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY reflexively in the first place. Waiting, finally, permits you to retaliate in a form and at a level of your choosing. Recall Black's dissatisfaction with his initial reflexive strike against the associate who punched him from behind. ""I didn't get no solid lick of his ass [that night],""3 he complained. ""I didn't get mine back."" Biding his time for a couple of days, to make the violator believe that ""everything was cool,"" Black struck with full force when he felt the moment was opportune. What is important is that he waited for an audience to be present, perhaps to ""show up"" the associate in the same way he, Black, had been shown up. Black also appeared to use the audience as a lure to bring the violator out and make him feel comfortable, as is evident below: He walked down the steps . . . in front of his house . . . just standing there. You know,we in a group,we down the street. We just talking. I figure that as he walk down the steps. I just didn't approach him then. He started coming down where the crowd was . . . it was cool . . . when he got down there that was it . . . I just did to him what he did to me . . . I hit his motherfucking ass . . . I just hauled off and stole his ass . . . [Then] I kicked him and kicked him . . . he was gone. Robbed while selling drugs, Sugar managed to remove the scarf that con- cealed the perpetrator's face. Recognizing the violator (it was another female drug dealer, apparently jealous of Sugar's success), Sugar decided to wait ""a week and let it die down a minute . . . [to] let [that] whore . . . think [she] got me."" Sugar also indicated that had she retaliated more quickly, the violator would have been waiting for her ""with something powerful that'd fuck you up."" Driving down the street one evening, Sugar and an accomplice spotted the violator at a bus stop. They followed the bus after the woman embarked, and snuck up on her as she got off and began walking home. Sugar and the accomplice administered a terrible beating and managed to recoup far more than the $350 cash and quarter pound of marijuana lostin the initialrobbery: My partner had a big stick. She was hitting her like in her ribs . . . I was just hit- ting her in her face . . . stomping her ass . . . whipping her ass . . . big old cut . . . right back here by her ear . . . face all fucked up . . . and then I got like directly in front of her and I kind of like stomped her down in a sack . . . ""You taking my motherfucker shit. You ain't gonna do that shit no more. I ain't the bitch to play with"" . . . [We took a] thousand dollars . . . two quarter pounds [of marijuana] . . . big [diamond rings] . . . nice little chain . . . earrings . . . We took every mother- fucking thing. Grievants need not wait an extensive amount of time to exact revenge. Indeed, it behooved them not to wait too long lest they make it appear as if Jacobs / STREET CRIMINAL RETALIATION 305 they had accepted the violation (nor did they want to wait that long, owing to anger). The length of time a grievant waited was less important than how she or he used time relative to space to cultivate the element of surprise. Robbed at gunpoint of $600 cash, his car, and a ring he had purchased for his infant son, Crazy Jay could not discern the perpetrator's identity (the robber wore a mask). He did, however, recognize the robber's voice and also the work boots he wore during the robbery, which had distinctive paint stains. The man was a crack user who resided upstairs to Crazy Jay; both men lived at an extended- stay motel and Jay, a dealer, had sold drugs to him there numerous times. Set- ting his alarm for 7 a.m. the following morning--Crazy Jay "" . . . wanted him to think he got me [and that] I didn't know who he was""--Jay and an asso- ciate burst into the violator's apartment and ""shocked his ass,"" beating him senseless: Started hitting him with the gun . . . 30 or 40 times . . . on top of his head, on his back, on his face . . . ""You bitch-ass nigger, you motherfucking dope head, . . . you puss-ass nigger"" . . . he was as bloody as a motherfucker . . . after I hit him so many times I was starting to lose my breath so I stood back . . . I cocked my gun and I was like, ""Now I'm gonna kill you 'cause you not only taking from me, you taking from my kids so now you got to die."" Crazy Jay stopped the beating only after learning the whereabouts of his car (in a nearby parking lot). He then picked up a large bowl and smashed the TV, ensuring that the violator would have to check out of his room that day (he obviously did not want him living upstairs). Able to recoup $200 and his car (minus the radio), Crazy Jay never recovered his son's ring. This clearly incensed him, particularly because he had reportedly given the violator spe- cial treatment as a customer (i.e., delivery sales, credit). ""You bite the hand that feeds you[,] . . . you need to be disciplined,"" Crazy Jay explained. Deter- rence also was on his mind. ""If you ever, ever, ever, decide to do that shit again,"" he described his thinking, ""[remember] this first 'cause it gonna be even more severe."" Mad Dog let two days elapse before he returned to even a score against a neighborhood rival who had approached him menacingly with a gun (Mad Dog was in his car on a date at the time and was forced to speed off). ""Just to let it cool down some,"" he explained. ""So they [the violator and his associ- ates] wouldn't be paranoid or nothing. Tripping off who coming down the street [if I were to come that same night]."" Mad Dog secured a .45 revolver and borrowed a car from a drug user. He chose not to drive his own car for fear it would be recognized as he approached, which would have permitted his targets to flee or mount a preemptive strike of their own. Mad Dog picks up the story: 306 JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY I pulled around the corner I saw them out standing next to the car, so I pulled up like it wasn't no problem, like I was just driving through. Pulled up, stopped next to them, went on and looked out of the car. He [the violator] saw my face. [He] started to turn like he was going by to get something, like he was about to run or something, [then I] pulled the gun up. I started shooting . . . I was just shooting. I wasn't even aiming . . . because the way they was standing there I figured there ain't no way I could miss . . . I shot about six times. The cases of Sugar, Crazy Jay, and Mad Dog suggest a critical lack of coercive power atthe moment the violation occurred, making reflexive retali- ation inappropriate. Grievants want respect but they do not want to get killed, and generally will submit when placed in a position of extreme vulnerability (see Luckenbill [1981] on the dynamics of compliance generation). This is not weakness, it is smart and helps you survive. Black's initialreflexive strike was, as readers recall, unsatisfactory, requiring him to strike a second time. Calculation was his preferred mode of attack. Though any or all of these respondents may have attacked by surprise to cover the fact that they were afraid, there is no real way of knowing. What calculated strikes lack in celer- ity, however, they can make up for in certainty and severity, and perhaps this is what makes them so attractive. Sneaking up on a violator at a time and place of one's choosing virtually guarantees punishment. Because the viola- tor is likely to have reduced defensibility atthe timeof the attack,resistanceis improbable. This may allow the punishment to go on longer and to be more severe than if the punishment was administered reflexively. In so doing, grievants' reputations not only are salvaged, they arguably are enhanced. Deferred Retaliation Face-to-face retaliation that is delayed where the delay is not desired by the retaliating party is called deferred retaliation. Delays may be caused by a number of factors. The initial affront may not involve face-to-face contact. The affront may involve face-to-face contact but reflexive action may not be possible due to setting, circumstance, or some strategy used by the violator. The aggrieved party may be under a false impression about what is occurring at the time the affront occurs (e.g., valuables that are lent but never returned become stolen, but at the time they are loaned, this is not apparent). The ag- grieved party may not know the identity of the violator. The aggrieved party may know the violator but have trouble locating him or her. The aggrieved party may want to retaliate but be compelled to wait due to the presence of formal or informal social control (e.g., police, natural surveillance). Deferred retaliation typically undergoes a period of incubation first. How long the incubation period lasts depends on how long it takes to ascertain the Jacobs / STREET CRIMINAL RETALIATION 307 identity and/or whereabouts of the violator, how long it takes to realize that a ""loan"" actually is a theft, or how long it takes to get the violator in a suffi- ciently vulnerable position to make retaliation possible. These things are sit- uational, so whether and when deferred retaliation occurs relative to the affront cannot be predicted with certainty. Retaliation that keeps getting deferred will persist in a state of incubation. Eventually, it will move either to nonretaliation or, possibly, what Jacobs, Topalli, and Wright (2000) call ""imperfect retaliation""--retribution committed against a third party innocent of the affront. As Bottcher (2001:925) illustrates,""even in cases in which vic- timsare not personally responsible for affronts or harm, some crimes can best be understood as 'practices of collective liability'--victims stand in, so to speak, for wrongs"" committed by someone else (see also Black 1983). More on this possibility shortly. Black engaged in deferred retaliation after some of his marijuana was ""stolen"" from a dwelling in which he and some associates had been partying (Black left the party and when he returned, his marijuana was missing). Stolen is placed in quotation marks because, according to Black, the ""motherfucker [who took it, an associate with whom he had been partying] left money."" In Black's mind, this was irrelevant. ""My shit wasn't for sale,"" he explained. ""It was just a simple principle. Somebody went in my shit [and they shouldn't have] . . . I ain't no bitch . . . I ain't no punk."" Learning the next day (from another associate) precisely who took the $10 bag, he beat the vio- lator with a metal pipe. ""I hit him up side his motherfucking head and split it there and put a big old pussy in his head."" D-boy also was burglarized, though his loss was considerably larger: The rims off his car, a car stereo, two televisions, and a DVD player (also from his car). He obtained a description of the burglar from a neighbor, which he matched to other clues to make a positive identification. D-boy encountered the thief on the street one afternoon, and dialogue quickly gave way to vio- lence. The thief apparently struck first, but D-boy reportedly got the better of him. ""He swung on me first,"" D-boy recalled, but he missed and ""when he missed I hit him one time and dropped him and he held his eye and moved his hand and itlooked like his eye could talk."" D-boy clearly remained concerned about counter-retaliation, however, even though he felt his action was justi- fied. The man lived close by, knew where to find him, and would undoubtedly be embarrassed after waking ""up with a fat-assed purple and red and bur- gundy eye . . . revenge, revenge, revenge,"" D-Boy ruminated. ""That's all that's on his mind."" Three days after his car windows were smashed, his tires punctured, and his vehicle's exterior dented, Biddle ascertained the identity of the vandal. It was the boyfriend of the girl Biddle had been having sex with, behind the boyfriend's back (one of Biddle's crack-using customers--Biddle was a 308 JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY dealer--told him).4 Retaliation did not come for another two weeks. Biddle needed additional time to piece together information to confirm the vandal's identity. When reprisal came, it came opportunistically: I popped over [to the girl's house one day]. He [the vandal] was on the front . . . [I] rolled past [and parked in the back] . . . get my bat out the trunk . . . Louisville Slugger. His name [the bat] Johnny [and I came through the house to the front porch] . . . and I'm like ""What's up, player?"" . . . He tried to break out and just run 'cause he knew he was guilty . . . I swung the bat. Hit him in the back. He fell. Boom . . . [Then I] broke two of his legs . . . neighbors came out . . . [and] grabbed me [and stopped the beating]. Jay was forced to wait somewhere between two and three months before retaliating against his ""bitch ass"" aunt, who had stolen $350 from a cookie jar in his home. ""She seen me put my money up there [after a drug sale],"" Jay recalled, ""when I left [the house, she came back and took it]."" Jay claimed he ""wasn't that hot at first,"" but after it became clear that his aunt was ""dodging"" him, he decided to visit his grandmother, knowing the aunt would ""pop up sooner or later."" She did and Jay ""caught that bitch just the way I wanted to,"" grabbing her by the back of her head and punching and kicking her. Though the aunt subsequently called the police on Jay, for which he served several hours in jail, he reportedly felt a sense of ""relief like the money [she] stole was wiped [her] ass with."" Sneaky Retaliation Retaliation that is delayed where the delay is desired by the retaliatory party but where face-to-face contact with the violator is lacking is called sneaky retaliation. Because the delay is desired, it implies a certain degree of strategizing on the part of the grievant. That is, the grievant wants to ""get"" the violator in a particular way, there are particular reasons for this, and acting too quickly may undermine these reasons. Because the strike does not involve face-to-face contact, it also would seem that the grievant wants to keep his or her identity secret--possibly to minimize the risk of detection and arrest or of suffering a counter-retaliatory strike. If it is the case that the grievant wants to victimize the violator in the same way she or he was victim- ized, the violation itself may not have involved contact--assuming the grievant wants to match the response with the affront (which is not always the case). Consider the case of Block, a street-level drug dealer who stashed $600 worth of crack in a vacant building before leaving the area. Someone had apparently been watching him, however, and seized the stash after he left. Jacobs / STREET CRIMINAL RETALIATION 309 Returning to find his drugs missing, Block was ""fucking mad"" but did not know who stole the cache for about a month. Discovery came when the thief revealed the heist to his girlfriend, who (unknowingly to him) was friends with Block's girlfriend. A subsequent phone conversation between Block and his girlfriend exposed the violator: He told his gal and his gal cool with my gal . . . [but] he didn't know they was cool . . . they just gossiping on the phone . . . he was bragging to his gal about it and she running her mouth . . . and [then it got back to me]. Waiting an additional two weeks, Block enlisted a friend to set up a drug deal to lure the violator out of his house. Block and a third associate then bur- glarized the dwelling, netting two ounces of powder cocaine, one ounce of crack, a drug scale, and over $300 in cash. This bounty represented consider- ably more than what Block lost. Asked why he chose burglary as opposed to violent reprisal, Block responded that he was ""playing his [the violator's] game . . . I'm playing him the same way [he played me]."" In a subsequent interview with one of Block's co-offenders (the one involved in the burglary), it was revealed that the burglary actually turned into a robbery. The co-offender reported that he and Block waited in a dark- ened hallway inside the violator's house, and attacked when the violator returned. Block, however, apparently did not take part in the robbery beyond simply being there; the co-offender reportedly did the talking, threatening, and striking. Both men, however, were masked, preserving the offense's sneaky nature: There was contact, but it was not ""face-to-face."" Clearly, it pleased Block that the violator was uncertain about who victim- ized him. Knowing that you've been exploited but not knowing who did itcan be agonizing. No amount of searching will turn up the needed information so long as the perpetrators (in this case, Block and his associates) remain silent. Frustration may not necessarily subside, or subside significantly, over time, and Block's strategy was intended to make the violator boil. A subsequent run-in with the antagonist revealed the success of his strategy: Block: . . . we see him every day . . . He's pissed . . . he riding around mad . . . Author: Do you think he knows that you did it? Block: If he does he might have an idea because he knows he got me. He probably like ""that nigger Block probably got me."" But I'm watching him though. See what I'm saying? I'm watching him. Just because a strike was sneaky did not preclude it from involving exces- sive violence. The issue is whether the grievant's identity is known to the vio- lator as the strike occurs, not whether there is contact (or even how much). 310 JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY Accidentally bumping into another man at a tavern one evening, Red spilled his glass of cognac on him. Irate, the man (who was on a date with a female companion), ""knocked the shit"" out of Red, giving him no opportunity to apologize first. Other patrons inside the bar witnessed the assault, as did the female companion, whom Red vaguely knew. Embarrassed and enraged, Red left the bar and went to his vehicle, where he retrieved his pistol and sat waiting for four hours. When the violator exited--drunk and oblivious to Red's presence--Red attacked, maximizing the shock value by sneaking up and shooting him numerous times from behind. Though Red could have responded immediately, this would have prevented him from using the level of coercive force he desired. Attacking by surprise, later in the parking lot, also reduced the chances that somebody would witness the strike. The rage he felt that night was palpable in the interview room months after the incident occurred: A man don't never put his hand on another man . . . ain't never in my life had a motherfucker smack me before. Beside my mom and my dad. Them are the only one I ever had in my life smack me . . . I'm 43 years old . . . I'm stone cold, that's the bottom line, the dude should never had put his hands on me. He should have never smacked me . . . [I was] straight up angry. After someone had slapped his sister, Smoke Dog opted to have proxies do the retributive work for him. One of the most ruthless members of the sam- ple, Smoke Dog clearly was not afraid to do it himself. Rather, he reported being at a point in his life where discretion was more valuable. ""I'm trying to be a G [a wise street criminal] about it now . . . if it's too hard for me and I can't handle it then I go hire my little homies . . . they just love to shoot."" Retributive proxies were the choice for Paris as well, though for more press- ing reasons. The police stumbled into him right after being beaten, robbed, and carjacked; any retributive act would almost have certainly incriminated him first: Why didn't I do it? 'Cause I didn't want to take the blame. 'Cause the police al- ready had my name or what ever, you know cause they picked me up from the ambulance or what ever and I know they just gonna be like, ""Maybe this guy did it"" or whatever. Retaliation by proxy is sneaky because the violator is unable to link the strike to the hiring party. Though it is conceivable for the grievant to instruct the hit party to tell the violator for whom the strike was being performed, this strategy did not appear to be widely adopted.5 Grievants with sufficiently fierce street reputations need not fear looking like a ""punk"" by having some- Jacobs / STREET CRIMINAL RETALIATION 311 one else do their dirty work. What mattered was retribution, not who per- formed it. ""As long as it's taken care of,"" Moon illustrates, ""it don't matter [if I do it or I have somebody do it for me]."" Not all offenders can stake this claim, nor do they want to when, for example, an affront is particularly seri- ous or hits especially close to home. Such circumstances require self-help in the literal sense of the word. Imperfect Retaliation Retaliation that is delayed where the delay is not desired by the retaliating party and where face-to-face contact with the violator is lacking is called imperfect retaliation. Imperfect retaliation occurs when grievants reprise someone other than the person who committed the violation. Typically, it is an option of last resort, not first, after grievants have been unable to identify, locate, and punish the wrongdoer in question. Displaced reactions typically accomplish one of three objectives: message-sending, loss recovery, and anger release. These objectives need not be mutually exclusive. Kimmy, a female stripper, lost several hundred dollars to a fellow dancer during a private motel sex party. Kimmy had apparently gone into the bath- room to perform sexual acts on one of the partygoers and asked the other stripper to watch her purse. She reportedly took it instead. Enraged, Kimmy had yet to locate the woman at the time of our interview, about three weeks after the theft. A week after the theft, Kimmy's cousin spotted an associate of the violator at a local 7-11 store. The cousin phoned Kimmy, Kimmy jumped into her badly damaged car (it had a broken axle and was barely drivable), and rammed it into the associate's parked vehicle. Kimmy then grabbed a metal pole from her car, ran into the store, and attacked the woman. Kimmy explains why she did what she did, why it was better to strike imperfectly than not at all, and also why she ultimately did not obtain closure with this imperfect strike: Beat her partner's ass . . . fuck her 'cause that's her [the violator's] friend and she knows some shit about [the stolen money]. . . . When she seen my face she know what the hell I'm up there for . . . [But I want the violator to] see [by beat- ing her friend] that I'm not playing . . . even if it stops right there I know I did something . . . that's the closest thing I could [do] . . . [But] I'm gonna kill this bitch [the violator]. . . . Anybody fuck with my money . . . [is] fucking with my daughter 'cause that's where my money go . . . Even if I get my $900 back I'm gonna beat her ass anyway . . . I could be . . . on my deathbed. I swear I get my ass up and try to beat this bitch's ass. I swear I will. Goldie recounted a similar story after failing to locate any of the four per- petrators who robbed him of his necklace at a bus stop one evening. Three 312 JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY months after the robbery, Goldie spoke with a man who claimed to have knowledge of the whereabouts of at least one of the offenders. This person reportedly possessed the necklace or at minimum knew where it was. He operated from a neighborhood close to Goldie's, just four blocks away. Goldie went there, where he spotted the man's younger brother and ""con- firmed"" that he was one of the perpetrators. Goldie picks up the story: I saw his little brother and I went up to him, I didn't have my burner [gun] on me at the time so I'm just like, ""Where's your brother at?"" ""I don't know where he is, I don't know where he is."" I'm like, ""Well, tell him Goldie, he's gonna holler at him about something."" Instantly he already knew, I could see that in his face, that he already knew.""So you're Goldie? OK,well I'll tell him, I'll tell him."" ... So I come back. His brother's still in the same damn spot but this time I got a burner with me. I'm looking for trouble, 'cause I know he's somewhere around here, 'cause his little brother's still around . . . at the same time I'm seeing him rumbling with a little pack that he had, I guess it was some crack or what ever. So I'm like, ""Well, you just give me that right there, that'll pay for it."" . . . ""OK, I ain't doing anything, he did it."" So now he's telling on his brother. ""So where is he?"" . . . ""Oh, I can't tell you where . . . "" So I'm like, ""Well, you can take for it then . . ."" [I got] about $400, $1,300 of dope . . . [told] him to go back and tell his brother. Imperfect reprisal is best considered an interim procedure as opposed to a replacement for direct retribution. Generally speaking, there is no substitute for symmetrical vengeance. The violator who commits the wrong must ulti- mately be punished lest she or he think that she or he has ""gotten away"" with it and be inspired to commit another offense. It may be true, however, that some imperfect strikes are ""less imperfect"" than others. Strikes committed against someone ""close"" to the violator may help to flush him or her out, which makes direct reprisal easier to accomplish. If material losses are recov- ered as part of the attack,the original violation may ""sting less,"" and few mea- sures are better at communicating the message that grievants are mad, look- ing, poised to attack, and nearby than an attack of the kind performed by Kimmy and Goldie. Absent a direct strike, this is the most would-be retali- ators can hope to accomplish. DISCUSSION Using qualitative techniques of analytic induction, constant comparison, and domain analysis, this article has offered a typology of criminal retalia- tion organized around two axial factors: Whether reprisal occurs immedi- ately after the affront and whether face-to-face contact with the violator is Jacobs / STREET CRIMINAL RETALIATION 313 involved. Immediate reprisal with face-to-face contact was called reflexive retaliation. Immediate reprisal without face-to-face contact was called re- flexively displaced retaliation (though there were no reported cases). When retaliation is delayed, an added contingency was introduced--whether the delay is desired by the grievant. This permits four additional possibilities. Face-to-face retaliation where the delay is desired was called calculated retaliation. Face-to-face retaliation where the delay is not desired was called deferred retaliation. Retaliationwithout face-to-face contact where the delay is desired was calledsneaky retaliation. Retaliationwithout face-to-face con- tact where the delay is not desired was called imperfect retaliation. The data clearly underscore the importance of direct confrontation in retaliatory strikes. Retaliation without face-to-face contact with the violator may, in fact, deliver harm but not the kind of harm that cuts to the core of streetvalues. An essentialpart of payback isfor the violator to know unequiv- ocally that he or she has been put in his or her place by the specific person he or she has wronged. Without this knowledge, the violator may be led to believe that the victim has accepted the affront and is ""soft."" The absence of reported cases of reflexively displaced retaliation most powerfully highlights the import of contact. The streets are a hypermasculine world (Maher and Daly 1996), so attacking someone or something of value to the violator rather than the violator him- or herself, even when the violator is ""right there"" (the essence of reflexively displaced retaliation) makes you look weak. In street culture, this is sometimes called a ""bitch move""; it can be worse than not striking at all. This is not to suggest that strikes without contact are entirely or inevitably unacceptable, however. Sneaky retaliation may well be the work of veteran criminals with ""juice"" and be understood as such by relevant parties, and imperfect reprisal can communicate that direct retaliation is imminent--circumstances simply have not yet allowed it to happen. In nei- ther case do grievants necessarily sacrifice status, though it probably remains true that a direct strike is better at minimizing this possibility. The importance of punitive excess isequally clear. Ironically, itsrelevance may be most apparent when retaliation is delayed--ironic in that delay intro- duces separation between the ""aversive stimulus"" (i.e., the violation) and reprisal, which should ""unbound"" rationality and moderate the attack rather than intensify it. But anger seems to boil, not cool. Delays give grievants the opportunity to mull over what has happened and to become more incensed rather than less. Shock ""gives way to indignation and then outrage"" as the magnitude of the violation sinks in (Rather 2001). This ""rumination"" pro- cess, as Bies and Tripp (1996) refer to it, allows grievants to revisit the viola- tion mnemonically, digging up new facts and evidence ""overlooked in the initial processing of the violation . . . [and] to 'discover' more personalistic causes of the violation,"" which enhances the transgressor's blame (Bies and 314 JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY Tripp 1996:254). Anger may be especially intense if there is mounting frus- tration about the identity and/or whereabouts of the violator. If so, the reprisal that follows is intended not only to make back what grievants lost, but to ""compensate"" them for the cognitive burden carried since the affront.6 A number of the calculated and deferred strikes explored in this article attest to this escalation of anger and its role in producing punitive excess. The forms in which street criminals express their retaliatory impulses are of significant interest, but perhaps more intriguing are the reasons grievants choose one option over another when several are realistically available. Why, for example, sneaky reprisal as opposed to reflexive, calculated as opposed to deferred, or sneaky as opposed to calculated when circumstances permit any or all three? Given that timing and contact are the critical orienting dimen- sions, and both mediate behavior, at least in a volitional sense, only when delays are desired, risk sensitivity would seem to be the relevant explanation. This is obvious and also somewhat tautological. Any tactic that reduces a grievant's chances of encountering resistance, counter-retaliation, or arrest betrays sensitivity to risk; delays and striking without contact do all three. More instructive, perhaps, are the factors that condition risk sensitivity by influencing dispreferences for contact and preferences for delay. Verticaldis- tances between disputants (Black 1983) and the presence or absence of third parties (Cooney 1998) bear consideration in this regard. Violators in the present study were strangers, loose acquaintances, friends, and in at least one instance, family members, of varying though roughly equivalent statuses, and the preference for direct contact was reasonably uni- form. As status differences intensify, this picture may change--a pattern that would seem to hold for both upward and downward revenge. Thus, low status parties who reprise others they ""shouldn't"" will face severe consequences, which they know and may opt against (see, e.g., Homans 1961). Reprisal is better performed sneakily, or redirected against parties perceived to be less formidable and/or those having little or nothing to do with the violation in question. Though it is conceivable for low-status grievants to want bold, face-to-face strikes as a way of enhancing their stature, or because their already-inferior reputation does not permit anything less, the likely costs are sufficiently high to render such attacks unwise. High-status grievants would seem to prefer face-to-face strikes against lower-status violators for precisely the opposite reason--striking without contact permits someone lower than you to take your respect, which brings you down to that person's level and fully announces to others that you are letting this happen--but perhaps the status imbalance is so great that direct reprisal ceases to be meaningful or necessary. For grievants like Smoke Dog, for example, violations become ""petty"" and ""not worth their time,"" making sneak attacks not only reasonable but preferred. Or, perhaps, imperfect retaliation is the only available way to Jacobs / STREET CRIMINAL RETALIATION 315 send a message to the person really being sought; without sending this mes- sage, status might be presumed to be lower than it really is (as the stories of Goldie and Kimmy seem to suggest). Third parties are relevant for issues of timing. Assuming their presence does not generate coercive power imbalances for either disputant or intro- duce levels of natural surveillance sufficient to deter contemplated behavior, audiences generally increase the importance of celerity. Reputations are ""on the line"" when violations are committed, but this is especially true when oth- ers are around to witness (or hear quickly, secondhand about) their occur- rence. The dilemma for many grievants is that situational circumstances fre- quently do not permit the level of punishment they desire at the moment a violation occurs, and perhaps for some time thereafter. Trading celerity for severity is difficult, but logical when the ""content"" of the lesson is more important than the rapidity with which it is delivered.7 Waiting, at least in part, is a function of the desire to avoid sanctions one- self, but if such concerns exceeded or even rivaled concerns for punishment, retaliation would always be delayed. It also would rarely involve face-to-face contact or be excessive. Excess is especially noteworthy irrespective of tim- ing, or even contact, because disproportionate strikes tend to be perceived as affronts that inspire countergrievances, and then reprisal, as a way of restor- ing reciprocity (see Tedeschi and Felson 1994:245). Conflict spirals occur because of the different ""arithmetics"" of punishment that grievants have in relation to violators. ""Such different arithmetics . . . occur because of an ego- centric bias in the experience of pain . . . and/or because some harms are hard to quantify, as when 'the principle of the thing' is at stake"" (Bies and Tripp 1996:259). In other words, violators may perceive an initial attack to be ""not that bad,"" but grievants do, and impose a level of harm far greater than the violation itself. Violators, feeling they have been wronged by an excessive strike, now become grievants, attacking excessively in return. Paradoxically, each side believes their actions are defensive(see Biesand Tripp 2001:203). The street criminal underworld is one of the few settings in which strong bilateral retaliatory capacities result in mutual escalation rather than mutual deterrence (see Ohbuchi and Saito 1986 on power imbalance in aggression). Though defiance in the face of punishment, as opposed to deterrence, is by no means unique to street offenders (Blau 1964; Homans 1961; Molm 1994; Sherman 1993), the sensitivity of identity to affronts makes it especially likely in this context. Lacking traditional sources of respect--occupational and familial roles cannibalized by persistent poverty and high rates of fam- ily disruption (Anderson 1999; Rosenfeld et al. 2003; Wilson 1996)-- reputation depends almost exclusively on how actors display and handle themselves in interaction. Disadvantage and marginalization, moreover, reduces the threshold at which some action is considered offensive, resulting 316 JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY in paranoid attributions of hostile intent (see, e.g., Dodge et al. 1990). Be- cause such hostility derives ultimately from structural sources over which individuals have littleperceived control, excessive responses emerge as com- pensation and catharsis (on violence as catharsis, see Tedeschi and Felson 1994). This explains why a ""relatively small effort targeted at the appropriate point can produce [a] disproportionate effect"" (Gabriel 1998:1341). It may be true, however, that different retaliatory modalities have different deterrent capacities net of punishment severity. Though strikes involving face-to-face contact (reflexive, calculated, and deferred) carry the highest potential for specific deterrence--the lesson is directed at the particular per- son who committed the wrong--they carry the highest risk of defiance for the reasons just described. Strikes that lack face-to-face contact reduce the chance of defiance, assuming violators remain unaware of the motive and source of the strike, but sacrifice specific deterrence in the process. Sneaky retaliation seems especially vulnerable to this problem: Strikes performed by someone other than the person wronged or performed too long after the vio- lation occurs, can signal weakness, especially if the violator never realizes that the harm she or he suffered was retaliatory in nature (which may be the case with at least some sneaky attacks). Sneaky strikes may succeed in get- ting payback, but if the reason for the strike and identity of the attacker remain unknown to the violator, the strike simply looks a random act of anti- social behavior--leaving the violator undeterred from committing subse- quent affronts and perhaps even more motivated to do so because now, they too have lost something. Also, general deterrence, obviously, is not possible unless grievants brag about the strike, which undermines the very reason for performing it sneakily. Whether the presence of defiance is ""worse"" than the absence of specific deterrence is unclear. Perhaps defiance and deterrence obtain at the same time: Violators may be enraged about suffering what they perceive to be excessive punishment--attacking the grievant in return--but this punish- ment may well inhibit them from violating others in a similar manner later on. General deterrence obtains when other would-be violators hear about prior acts of retribution committed against others and refrain from commit- ting violations themselves. The more tightly coupled the criminal network, the faster this ""vicarious"" message will tend to travel, and the more substan- tial this general deterrent effect will be (see Paternoster and Piquero 1995). Theoretically, a net gain in systemic stability could result from excessive but discrete strikes--even counting the potential for conflict spirals within and among particular disputants. Imperfect retaliation offers the exception. Grievants violate someone other than the person explicitly responsible for the violation, which creates a fresh (and additional dispute). The strike is inherently unjustified, so a defi- Jacobs / STREET CRIMINAL RETALIATION 317 ance effect is built into it. If the strike is excessively injurious (beyond its inherent lack of justification), defiance will be especially intense. The target of the imperfect attack may subsequently wish to retaliateagainst the original violator for ""causing"" him or her to be singled out (assuming the target and violator know each other). The imperfect target and original violator may then ""team up"" to reprise the original grievant. If an extensive period of time has elapsed between the initial violation and the imperfect strike, the original violator may be emboldened to commit yet more reprisable offenses, against the violator or unrelated others (see Paternoster and Piquero 1995 on the role of ""punishment avoidance effects"" in producing future criminality). The lon- ger a violator goes without being punished, the more severe that punish- ment must be when administered to compensate for the ""discounting"" caused by time (Nagin and Pogarsky 2001) which, of course, facilitates counter- retaliation. The wide range of retaliatory options available suggests that the rational- ity of street offenders may not be as bounded as some analysts presume. Whereas street criminals typically weigh a few aspects of a few alternatives and ignore the rest (Johnson and Payne 1986:173), the data offered in the present article suggest that more contemplative procedures may be at work. Such procedures need not be lengthy or extensive to be contemplative. Time pressure, threat, and uncertainty have a powerful tendency to increase focus, resulting in sharper analytic clarity and more efficient decision making (see. e.g., Arkes and Ayton 1999; Khatri and Ng 2000). Situational constraints may ironically advance this process; ironic in that bounding rationality may actually force choice to expand in the offending moment. The need for reci- procity is too important not to consider multiple options, and reprisal might otherwise be insufficiently retributive or pedagogical if performed without adequate consideration to contextual cues. This seeming expansion is strik- ing only insofar as it occurs against a backdrop of intense anger, and rational choice itself is thought to break down in anger's presence (Exum 2002). An- ger, when inspired by moralistic concerns, may permit alternative retaliatory scripts to emerge--scripts fueled by a hedonistic calculus that is less re- strictive but more sensitiveto communicating the desired punitivemessage. Fruitful directions for further inquiry lie squarely in the realm of choice and retaliation's implications for it. The extent to which retaliatory prefer- ences are stable or dynamic over time is noteworthy. Grievants may simulta- neously ponder multiple retaliatory targets, all at different stages of incuba- tion, which can affect strategies used both within incidents and across them. The unexpected emergence of one target while searching for another may well alter the nature and intensity of both strikes. Retributive choices can also mature over time, with grievants ""graduating"" from one modality to another. The nature, speed, and trajectory of this possible evolution warrant more pre- 318 JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN CRIME AND DELINQUENCY cise specification. In this regard, perhaps grievants who strike sneakily over time as opposed to reflexively may be quicker to forgive offenses they may previously have reprised. The difference between sneaky and nonretaliation is much smaller than the difference between reflexive and calculated retalia- tion. Explaining why reprisal does not occur given cultural imperatives pro- scribing pacifism is as important as why it does. Nonretaliation may often be by default--because the violator cannot be identified or found--but not always, and the reasons surrounding this choice deserve more systematic attention. NOTES 1. Though space limitations preclude me reproducing the complete interview guide here, examples of questions asked of respondents include the following: Has somebody done some- thing to you recently for which you have retaliated? What did the person do? How did you respond? What specifically did you do? Why did you respond that way? Have you encountered the offender since the attack? What happened? My interviewing style tends to be conversational, so readers should not infer a degree of formality or organization in the interview guide that does not exist. Dependingon the cadence and flow of each interview, different inquiries might be used to explore the same general topics. Readers interested in obtaining more information about the interview guide are asked to contact the author. 2. There were no reported cases of reflexively displaced retaliation, so this category neces- sarily is residual. The reasons for its absence will be explored in greater detail later. 3. Throughoutthe article, bracketed words indicate an attempt on my part to explain, clarify, or amplify something a respondent said. 4. As is evident from anecdotes like this one, grievants and violators are often difficult to distinguish. 5. There were no mentions of it in the transcripts, though in all candor, I did not specifically ask respondents whether they made such instructions. 6. This is probably true only for a finite period, due to basic psychophysological processes of anger. But this period may be longer in street culture than in comparable settings where law is unavailable, owing to the importance and fragility of respect. 7. I recognize the obvious benefits of identifying particular contextual circumstances that ""produce"" one type of retaliatory response over another (given the possible occurrence of multi- ple types), but the data did not seem to permit it. After analyzing the nature of the violation (vio- lent/nonviolent), the context in which it occurred (public/private), the apparent risk of sanction threats at the time the violation occurred (both formal and informal), apparent status differences between grievants and violators at the time of the offense, and apparent relational distances between grievants and violators (""apparent"" because it had to be intuited from the transcripts), I could discern no particular reason or reasons why one modality emerged over another--with a single exception and possibly one more: Reflexive strikes, relative to the other types, seemed to involve less physically threatening violations and an opportunity to strike spontaneously, whereas sneaky strikes often seemed to involve affronts without contact and violators who were known to the grievant at the time of the affront or shortly thereafter. I initially thought that deferredstrikes involved violations without contact and that calculated strikes requiredgrievants to have a deficit of coercive power when the violation occurred, but these criteria were not Jacobs / STREET CRIMINAL RETALIATION 319 necessarily distinguishing. Variation seemed to be more a function of choice in context than context by itself. REFERENCES Anderson, Elijah. 1999. Code of the Street. New York: Norton. Arkes, Hal R. and Peter Ayton. 1999.

Dear District Attorney Freeman,
I am contacting you today to demand justice for George Floyd who was brutally murdered by those who swore to protect him. As a concerned citizen, I demand the immediate charge of Derek Chauvin, Tuo Thao, and all other officers involved in this grisly killing. Their inaction proved to be as deadly as Chauvin's actions.
When you took office you swore to protect all victims of crimes in Minneapolis. George Floyd is the victim of a most heinous crime. His life was cut short as he was denied every liberty bestowed upon him as an American citizen. Due process, the right to seek justice, and the right to live, all stolen from him by a public servant.
Now, as you face the crossroads of this important decision, I trust you will make the right choice and bring charges against those officers who wrongfully and willfully murdered George Floyd on that fateful day. George Floyd deserves justice and you can deliver it. You must deliver it.
Regards,
Your name

212,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1001/Files (250).DOCX","The Independent (United Kingdom)",2020-10-28,"946 words","NEWS,WORLD,AMERICAS,US POLITICS; Version:1","Via AP news wire",NA,"3 social media CEOs face grilling by GOP senators on bias",FALSE," The CEOs of TwitterFacebook and Google are facing a grilling by Republican senators making unfounded allegations that the tech giants show anti-conservative bias.
The Senate Commerce Committee has summoned Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Sundar Pichai to testify for a hearing Wednesday. The executives agreed to appear remotely after being threatened with subpoenas.
With the presidential election looming, Republicans led by President Donald Trump have thrown a barrage of grievances at Big Tech's social media platforms, which they accuse without evidence of deliberately suppressing conservative, religious and anti-abortion views.
The chorus of protest rose this month after Facebook and Twitter acted to limit dissemination of an unverified political story from the conservative-leaning New York Post about Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, an unprecedented action against a major media outlet. The story, which was not confirmed by other publications, cited unverified emails from Biden's son Hunter that were reportedly disclosed by Trump allies.
Beyond questioning the CEOs, senators are expected to examine proposals to revise long-held legal protections for online speech, an immunity that critics in both parties say enables the companies to abdicate their responsibility to impartially moderate content.
The Justice Department has asked Congress to strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the tech companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms. Trump signed an executive order challenging the protections from lawsuits under the 1996 telecommunications law. 
""For too long, social media platforms have hidden behind Section 230 protections to censor content that deviates from their beliefs,"" Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., the Commerce Committee chairman, said recently.
In their opening statements prepared for the hearing, Dorsey, Zuckerberg and Pichai addressed the proposals for changes to so-called Section 230, a provision of a 1996 law that has served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet. Zuckerberg said Congress ""should update the law to make sure it's working as intended.""
""We don't think tech companies should be making so many decisions about these important issues alone,"" he said, approving an active role for government regulators.
Dorsey and Pichai, however, urged caution in making any changes. ""Undermining Section 230 will result in far more removal of online speech and impose severe limitations on our collective ability to address harmful content and protect people online,"" Dorsey said.
Pichai urged lawmakers ""to be very thoughtful about any changes to Section 230 and to be very aware of the consequences those changes might have on businesses and consumers.""
Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd told congressional leaders in a letter Tuesday that recent events have made the changes more urgent. He cited the action by Twitter and Facebook regarding the New York Post story, calling the companies' limitations ""quite concerning.""
The head of the Federal Communications Commission, an independent agency, recently announced plans to reexamine the legal protections, potentially putting meat on the bones of Trump's order by opening the way to new rules. The move by FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, a Trump appointee, marked an about-face from the agency's previous position.
Social media giants are also under heavy scrutiny for their efforts to police misinformation about the election. Twitter and Facebook have slapped a misinformation label on content from the president, who has around 80 million followers. Trump has raised the baseless prospect of mass fraud in the vote-by-mail process.
Starting Tuesday, Facebook was not accepting any new political advertising. Previously booked political ads will be able to run until the polls close next Tuesday, when all political advertising will temporarily be banned. Google, which owns YouTube, also is halting political ads after the polls close. Twitter banned all political ads last year.
Democrats have focused their criticism of social media mainly on hate speech, misinformation and other content that can incite violence or keep people from voting. They have criticized Big Tech CEOs for failing to police content, homing in on the platforms' role in hate crimes and the rise of white nationalism in the U.S.
Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have scrambled to stem the tide of material that incites violence and spreads lies and baseless conspiracy theories.
The companies reject accusations of bias but have wrestled with how strongly they should intervene. They have often gone out of their way not to appear biased against conservative views - a posture that some say effectively tilts them toward those viewpoints. The effort has been especially strained for Facebook, which was caught off-guard in 2016, when it was used as a conduit by Russian agents to spread misinformation benefiting Trump's presidential campaign.
The unwelcome attention to the three companies piles onto the anxieties in the tech industry, which also faces scrutiny from the Justice Department, federal regulators, Congress and state attorneys general around the country.
Last week, the Justice Department sued Google for abusing its dominance in online search and advertising - the government's most significant attempt to protect competition since its groundbreaking case against Microsoft more than 20 years ago.
With antitrust in the spotlight, Facebook, Apple and Amazon also are under investigation at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission.

To stop hate, we have to understand it.
FULL TEXT
The Sunday Review editor Honor Jones wrote about our decision to publish this story about the white supremacy movement in Friday's edition of our Opinion Today newsletter.
SEATTLE - Mount Rainier bobbed in the rearview mirror as Corinna Olsen drove north. In the passenger seat, I felt a soft bump against my back whenever she pumped the brakes. It came from a human head. Behind me, wrapped in opaque plastic, was a dead body.
Ms. Olsen is an embalmer, and her Dodge minivan is retrofitted for her job - instead of seats, the back holds two gurneys. She had picked up this particular body from a county coroner's office for transport to a funeral home. I was along for the ride because I was writing a book about hate in America, and Ms. Olsen used to be a white nationalist.
""I've been trying to decide which is the lesser of two evils, blacks or Mexicans,"" she wrote in a post on Stormfront, the hate movement's oldest online forum, in 2008. She went on to describe racist stereotypes, tarring Black people as criminals and saying Mexicans have too many kids.
Her language was cruel but familiar, drawing from America's communal well of white supremacy. Many white Americans are quick to distinguish between everyday prejudice and radical bigotry, but it's a false distinction. White nationalists make explicit ideas that are already coded or veiled in the wider white imagination. Hate is what many people would see if they looked in a fun-house mirror: a distorted but still recognizable reflection.
It is important to acknowledge this ugly truth if we hope to understand events now unfolding across the country.
Thousands of white people are joining protests against police brutality. Polls show a surge of support for the Black Lives Matter movement, and three-quarters of Americans believe racial discrimination is a serious problem, a 25-point jump from five years ago. These developments are heartening in a country that has refused a meaningful reckoning with racism for the last 400 years.
It would be a mistake, however, to assume that this moment heralds a future of unprecedented harmony.
There are questions about whether white lip service will translate into sustained anti-racist action, and about what the same people who condemn unlawful killings of Black Americans might have to say about less violent manifestations of racism, ones that benefit them. There is also the inevitability of backlash: History shows that there are always people who turn to hate in the very moments that others find hope.
There are nearly 1,000 hate groups in America, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, and the distribution of white-supremacist propaganda is ever widening. We know little about how to combat hate effectively; the federal government has cut funding for programs to counter right-wing extremism and blocked the dissemination of data on the subject. Only last year did the Department of Homeland Security acknowledge that white supremacy is a national security threat.
The gaps in knowledge mean that journalists and politicians often rely on flawed assumptions - for instance, that white nationalism is the sole province of angry men. Men are the far right's most recognizable evangelists, and bombings, shootings and rallies are the most obvious manifestations of the movement's strength. But there is other work keeping the flames of hate alive, and it is often done by women. Women like Corinna Olsen.
Ms. Olsen became an embalmer in her late 20s because, in a way, she had to. Divorced with two kids, she needed to make money. She had never finished college and did not have any demonstrable professional skills. But she had always been fascinated by rituals and what she calls ""the misunderstood""- subjects that are taboo or macabre. Embalming fit the bill.
Ms. Olsen also had a personal connection to the profession because of her younger brother, Harley. He was fun, outgoing, well-liked - everything she was not. Ms. Olsen had always struggled to connect with other people and to be understood.
At 20, Harley drowned in a boating accident on Oregon's Crescent Lake. Ms. Olsen was never able to look at his body. It took the authorities more than a year to recover it, and then he was cremated. As an embalmer, Ms. Olsen decided to specialize in difficult cases - gunshot victims, bodies charred in fires, corpses with battered and broken faces - to give families one last chance to see, maybe even to recognize, their loved ones.
Harley also inadvertently introduced Ms. Olsen to white nationalism. On what would have been his 27th birthday, in 2008, she found herself wanting to know more about her brother and the things that had mattered to him. He had been an anarchist who listened to punk music, wore black combat boots and hung out with skinheads in studded leather jackets. So Ms. Olsen went online and typed in, ""What are skinheads?""
She told me that she had no idea at the time that some skinheads were neo-Nazis. That's hard to believe, but similar explanations came up often in our conversations about her time in the hate movement. When she said that she hadn't known any better, I didn't get the impression that she hoped I would feel sorry for her. (I didn't.) Rather, she seemed to be saying that she knew she'd been an idiot. She should have known better and could have, if she'd cared to think more critically.
Ms. Olsen had never thought too hard about being white. Like many white Americans, she never had to. She grew up in a largely white school district in Eugene, Ore., and she did not interact meaningfully with people of other races until her late 20s, when she moved to Portland for her embalming career. She had paid such little mind to race as a concept that there was a flatness to her understanding of it, a one-dimensionality susceptible to simplified reasoning.
When her search for information about skinheads led straight to Stormfront, the racist bowels of the internet, Ms. Olsen wasn't fazed. Some Stormfront users said vile and violent things, but others talked about white pride and heritage.
And that didn't seem bad to her. Black people could celebrate their roots, Hispanic people, too. It stood to reason, Ms. Olsen thought, that white people should be able to do the same. Stormfront users presented this as if it were a mathematical proof, not a notion freighted with a racist, violent history.
Ms. Olsen wrote a post introducing herself and asking, ""Is there something wrong with being a white supremacist? I don't outwardly profess hatred for other races; I have to work with them and also serve clients of other races in my industry, and I am very good at what I do. I don't advocate violence toward other races."" She continued, ""What is wrong with seeing our race as superior to that of the blacks? Don't we all?""
The responses were plentiful and affirming. ""There is nothing wrong with having a personal opinion,"" one read. A commenter with the handle Thoughtful Patriot wrote, ""Let's face reality: People self-segregate by race."" Race, the person added, ""is an intrinsic part of who we are.""
To Ms. Olsen, these people seemed smart. Just as important, she told me, ""they seemed immensely interested in me and my life, and they wanted to be my friend."" To someone who ""grew up without friends, that was very appealing. It made me feel like I must be doing something right.""
She wasn't always sure that she believed what she said when she echoed her new friends' views, but what mattered was that they wanted to keep talking to her; all she had to do was log in and start typing. If playing a part graduated to instinct, maybe they would like her even more.
The most basic definition of hate is personal animus, but there is a more useful, and frightening, description: Hate is a social bond - a shared currency - and it abhors a vacuum.
Kathleen Blee, a sociologist and expert in ""racist activism,"" writes that ""social camaraderie, a desire for simple answers to complex political problems, or even the opportunity to take action against formidable social forces can coexist with, even substitute for, hatred as the reason for participation in organized racist activities.""
So can a need for validation, visibility and purpose. For someone like Ms. Olsen, hate becomes a cure for loneliness.
People who are drawn to the hate movement have an acute desire to make sense of their place in the world. There's a gap between who they are and who they think they should be, what they have and what they want. They want to seize or regain what they believe is a rightful status. They want empowerment, with minimal effort. Hate promises them that.
The movement's appeal goes something like this: America is a white country, built by white people, that is under attack from the enemies of the white race. The time is now or never to forestall racial annihilation. Anyone can do that by embracing white pride, standing up for the well-being of white people and securing America's future by having white children. Whoever joins the movement will be part of something greater than themselves, a ""righteous"" cause.
""Who doesn't want to lead people to victory?"" Ms. Olsen asked me.
Hate always exists, but it surges during periods of social upheaval, offering racist explanations for seismic change.
The Ku Klux Klan formed after the Civil War and reached its zenith in the 1920s, in an expanding, diversifying country. ""Its allures were manifold,"" the historian Linda Gordon writes of the Klan. ""They included the rewards of being an insider, of belonging to a community, of expressing and acting on resentments, of participating in drama, of feeling religiously and morally righteous, of turning a profit.""
White Citizens' Councils and other organs of resistance emerged in reaction to the civil rights movement. Hate fed on opposition to second- and third-wave feminism, the expansion of L.G.B.T.Q. rights, and shifting racial demographics.
Then came the election of President Barack Obama. ""Right-wing extremists are harnessing this historical election as a recruitment tool,"" a Homeland Security report noted in 2009. The first year of Mr. Obama's presidency, Stormfront registered nearly 100,000 new users.
Ms. Olsen was part of this wave, which also found fuel in the xenophobia of the post-Sept. 11 era and public disgust with the financial crisis. Her involvement accelerated quickly. Some of her online friends asked to meet in real life, and by 2009, she was the head of Portland's chapter of the National Socialist Movement. She read ""Mein Kampf,"" donned a uniform with Nazi insignia for meetings, and placed recruitment fliers with phrases like ""Jewish people are ruining America"" on windshields in parking lots.
In November 2009, she traveled with fellow neo-Nazis to Phoenix to attend a rally demanding a halt to the immigration of anyone who was not white. Participants also wanted to expel nonwhite people already in America. The rally's theme was ""America First,"" a slogan once used by isolationist politicians and the Klan that, several years later, Mr. Trump would invoke in his campaign for the White House.
Ms. Olsen's embalming career faltered and she all but lost contact with her children as she went deeper into the movement. In 2010, she left Portland for Montana, where she moved in with a white nationalist named April Gaede, best known as the stage mom of Prussian Blue, blond twin girls who made national headlines for playing racist music. The duo's name was a reference to the color of the residue left - or not left, according to Holocaust deniers - by Zyklon B in Nazi gas chambers.
After a few months, Ms. Olsen had a falling out with Ms. Gaede and relocated to Seattle, where she started working for the Northwest Front, a group that promoted the establishment of a white homeland in the Pacific Northwest. She soon gained notoriety as the co-host of Radio Free Northwest, a weekly broadcast, under the name ""Axis Sally."" It was a reference to Mildred Gillars, an American woman living in Germany who was handpicked by Joseph Goebbels to spread propaganda on Nazi radio to Allied troops in Europe. Gillars was later convicted of treason.
Being Axis Sally gave Gillars, a struggling actress, a platform, popularity and power. It did the same for Ms. Olsen. She became briefly famous enough for a Gawker profile in 2010: ""The internet is full of strange people,"" it read. Ms. Olsen ""may be the strangest.""
Many people rationalize their racism - or even refuse to call it that - by insisting that it isn't as bad as someone else's. They could spit on immigrants instead of complaining in private about foreigners stealing American jobs. They could put Jewish people in camps instead of muttering about how they have too much power.
Bigotry has many branches, some bigger and stronger than others, but they all derive from the same trunk. No wonder, then, that when ""somebody said he didn't like Black people, or he told a racist joke, or he said illegal immigration is wrong,"" Ms. Olsen recalled, she assumed he might be interested in becoming a neo-Nazi, too.
There were, however, lines Ms. Olsen said she wouldn't cross. In 2011, she decided she was done with white nationalism. That January, the police in Spokane disarmed a pipe bomb left on a bench along the route of a parade for Martin Luther King's Birthday. The bomb contained 128 fishing weights coated with rat poison, which impedes blood clotting, and human feces, which teem with infection-causing bacteria. The engineer was Kevin Harpham, an Army veteran and neo-Nazi who frequented the same kinds of online forums Ms. Olsen did.
Mr. Harpham would plead guilty to attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and to a hate crime. He said in court that he had intended for the bomb to be a protest against multiculturalism. It was also a gesture to fellow white nationalists. When people plant bombs, burn crosses, or run their cars into crowds of peaceful protesters, they are reinforcing their place in a community by inflicting terror.
In her telling, Ms. Olsen decided to leave the hate movement because she realized that she could not tolerate violence. That may have been part of it, but when I spoke to her, it was clear that she also exited because the movement stopped giving her the meaning and camaraderie she wanted.
She had clashed with people like Ms. Gaede and felt judged for her personal choices, namely her decision not to have more children. She wanted to restart her embalming career, and she had discovered that she had a knack for bodybuilding, winning amateur competitions and finding community at the gym.
People don't leave the hate movement because a veil lifts and they are suddenly able to see hate for what it is. The truth is more disappointing. They leave because it makes sense for them, because the value hate once gave them has diminished or evaporated. Ms. Olsen seemed to know this, writing once on a blog, ""The reality is, people rarely change their personality or ideals during adulthood, and if they do, it needs to be something they do on their own, for themselves.""
When the F.B.I. offered to pay her to inform on the Northwest Front, Ms. Olsen agreed. She worked as an informant for a few months, then cut ties with hate for good in late 2012. Shortly after, in an interview with the Southern Poverty Law Center, she said, ""I realized much too late that this entire movement is a huge waste of life.""
Just as Ms. Olsen was leaving the hate movement, it found a new source of energy. The resulting wave would wash over America, helping usher in the Trump presidency, the terrible events in Charlottesville, Va., and, in 2018, the highest number of killings attributed to right-wing extremists since the year of the Oklahoma City bombing.
But first, it inspired Dylann Roof to commit mass murder. In the manifesto he wrote before killing nine people at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., Mr. Roof described the shooting of Trayvon Martin as the event that ""truly awakened"" his racism.
""I read the Wikipedia article and right away I was unable to understand what the big deal was,"" Mr. Roof wrote in 2015. ""How could the news be blowing up the Trayvon Martin case,"" he asked, ""while hundreds of these Black-on-white murders got ignored?""
The shooting death of an unarmed Black teenager and the authorities' initial decision not to arrest the gunman, George Zimmerman, spurred protests. President Obama said, ""If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.""
Mr. Zimmerman was ultimately charged with second-degree murder and acquitted in 2013. Three activists on Twitter created the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter. A movement was born. Backlash followed in the form of the #WhiteLivesMatter and #AllLivesMatter campaigns, and in unfounded accusations that Black Lives Matter was a radical, violent organization.
Someprominent white supremacists now point to the birth of Black Lives Matter as a pivotal moment in their radicalization. Lana Lokteff, a white nationalist who runs the popular alt-news platform Red Ice with her husband, told me thatperiodwas when she realized ""the truth"" was ""pointing toward there being an attack on white people."" Ms. Lokteff produces videos with titles like ""Why They Want to Replace White People"" and peddles false narratives about Black-on-white crime.
This rhetoric is not confined to the internet's most shadowy corners. In late June, as protests against police brutality and systemic racism entered their fourth week, President Trump retweeted videos that seemed to show Black men attacking white people. Sounding eerily like Ms. Lokteff, Mr. Roof and other extremists, he demanded public outrage. Soon after, when New York City announced a plan to paint ""Black Lives Matter"" in yellow letters on Fifth Avenue, where Trump Tower sits, the president called it ""a symbol of hate.""
All this suggests that the uprisings in the name of Black liberation are cause for optimism, but also for vigilance.
Digital networks - and the White House - shovel disinformation into people's brains every minute of every day. Conspiracy theories run rampant. A pandemic is reshaping the social landscape, isolating people from one another and entrenching the worst unemployment crisis in nearly a century. The presidential election looms.
Perhaps more people than ever will emerge from 2020 on the side of justice. Still, there are those who will turn to hate, finding it - perversely - to be a kind of balm.
Research shows that a shared sense of racial identity is hardening among white Americans. The political scientist Ashley Jardina has found that some 20 percent of white Americans, roughly 40 million people, now have ""strong levels of group consciousness,"" meaning they ""feel a sense of discontent over the status of their group."" Having group consciousness does not automatically translate into prejudice, but the hate movement is poised to exploit white people's grievances and fears.
What can we do to stop it? There aren't easy answers. Tech companies should identify and ban hate speech, but this process inevitably becomes a game of Whac-a-Mole. Similarly, bringing the law to bear on hate speech and crimes is necessary but remedial; levying penalties for individual acts of wrongdoing won't vaccinate America against far-right extremism.
I will confess to being a pessimist by nature, and while reporting on the hate movement, I found it difficult not to feel despondent. Magnifying my gloom were encounters with white liberals who made statements that I recognized as precisely the kind of bait white nationalists use to make their case to the mainstream.
Standing in a breakfast buffet line, a middle-aged writer told me that I needed to be very careful with the book I was writing lest it hurt women (white ones, presumably). Of course, she said, what white-nationalist women support is wrong, but everyone is complicit in something, right? Lowering her voice, she added that America never would have had slavery if Africans hadn't sold their own people to European traders. In a tweet on July 4, Ms. Lokteff expressed the same idea more or less verbatim.
The least Americans can ask of one another is to have frank conversations about whiteness, no matter how uncomfortable. People concerned about the tide of hate can also work to empower minority populations, tackle inequality, foster dialogue about prejudice and root discriminatory ideas out of American life. They can vote bigots out of office. They can support the work of groups like Life After Hate, which helps people leave far-right groups.
First, though, combating hate requires understanding it. Not what it seems to be, but what it actually is. That includes who embraces it, and why.
So much of history is made up of small moves. Hope, too, dwells in increments. There is hope if white Americans can confront the true face of hate and their own complicity in bigotry. There is hope if we can see white nationalism as a crisis of individual and collective responsibility.
Ms. Olsen knows how hate works, because it worked on her. These days, she likes sticking it to the racists she once considered friends. She has bragged on Twitter about ordering a Black Lives Matter T-shirt to wear to the gym so that she could ""offend multiple people.""
She had also ordered a Nike hijab. Once a seeker, always one: In 2018, Ms. Olsen decided to become a Muslim.
She liked how the religion gave structure to her days. She liked that Islam was a topic she could learn about from books. Keeping her body covered meant that it was hers and no one else's. ""It is freeing, actually, to feel like I'm taking something away from men,"" she told me. At her mosque, the other worshipers didn't want anything from her; they just seemed glad she was there, practicing Islam alongside them.
When she was done transporting bodies for the day, we visited the mosque. ""Sister Corinna!"" I heard several Black and brown women crow happily when they saw her. She had friends here who cared about her. Sometimes she led exercise classes in the mosque's gym, cuing women through rounds of lunges and push-ups.
Once in a class, a call to prayer emanated from a loudspeaker. The women rushed to the middle of the gym's floor. They left their shoes in a pile and stood in a line. One used her cellphone to find the direction of Mecca. ""A little to the left!"" she instructed her classmates, and the group edged that way.
The prayer began. Silent, the women stood hip to hip - all except Ms. Olsen. She was at one end of the line, where she had left a gap between her body and the rest of the group. The woman closest to her glanced over. She was tall and willowy, an immigrant from Niger. She extended a hand, sending a ripple through her abaya. She grasped Ms. Olsen's arm and tugged her close.

The Senate Commerce Committee has summoned Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Sundar Pichai to testify for a hearing Wednesday. The executives agreed to appear remotely after being threatened with subpoenas.
With the presidential election looming, Republicans led by President Donald Trump have thrown a barrage of grievances at Big Tech's social media platforms, which they accuse without evidence of deliberately suppressing conservative, religious and anti-abortion views.
The chorus of protest rose this month after Facebook and Twitter acted to limit dissemination of an unverified political story from the conservative-leaning New York Post about Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, an unprecedented action against a major media outlet. The story, which was not confirmed by other publications, cited unverified emails from Biden's son Hunter that were reportedly disclosed by Trump allies.
Beyond questioning the CEOs, senators are expected to examine proposals to revise long-held legal protections for online speech, an immunity that critics in both parties say enables the companies to abdicate their responsibility to impartially moderate content.
The Justice Department has asked Congress to strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the tech companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms. Trump signed an executive order challenging the protections from lawsuits under the 1996 telecommunications law. 
""For too long, social media platforms have hidden behind Section 230 protections to censor content that deviates from their beliefs,"" Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., the Commerce Committee chairman, said recently.
In their opening statements prepared for the hearing, Dorsey, Zuckerberg and Pichai addressed the proposals for changes to so-called Section 230, a provision of a 1996 law that has served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet. Zuckerberg said Congress ""should update the law to make sure it's working as intended.""
""We don't think tech companies should be making so many decisions about these important issues alone,"" he said, approving an active role for government regulators.
Dorsey and Pichai, however, urged caution in making any changes. ""Undermining Section 230 will result in far more removal of online speech and impose severe limitations on our collective ability to address harmful content and protect people online,"" Dorsey said.
Pichai urged lawmakers ""to be very thoughtful about any changes to Section 230 and to be very aware of the consequences those changes might have on businesses and consumers.""
Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd told congressional leaders in a letter Tuesday that recent events have made the changes more urgent. He cited the action by Twitter and Facebook regarding the New York Post story, calling the companies' limitations ""quite concerning.""
The head of the Federal Communications Commission, an independent agency, recently announced plans to reexamine the legal protections, potentially putting meat on the bones of Trump's order by opening the way to new rules. The move by FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, a Trump appointee, marked an about-face from the agency's previous position.
Social media giants are also under heavy scrutiny for their efforts to police misinformation about the election. Twitter and Facebook have slapped a misinformation label on content from the president, who has around 80 million followers. Trump has raised the baseless prospect of mass fraud in the vote-by-mail process.
Starting Tuesday, Facebook was not accepting any new political advertising. Previously booked political ads will be able to run until the polls close next Tuesday, when all political advertising will temporarily be banned. Google, which owns YouTube, also is halting political ads after the polls close. Twitter banned all political ads last year.
Democrats have focused their criticism of social media mainly on hate speech, misinformation and other content that can incite violence or keep people from voting. They have criticized Big Tech CEOs for failing to police content, homing in on the platforms' role in hate crimes and the rise of white nationalism in the U.S.
Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have scrambled to stem the tide of material that incites violence and spreads lies and baseless conspiracy theories.
The companies reject accusations of bias but have wrestled with how strongly they should intervene. They have often gone out of their way not to appear biased against conservative views - a posture that some say effectively tilts them toward those viewpoints. The effort has been especially strained for Facebook, which was caught off-guard in 2016, when it was used as a conduit by Russian agents to spread misinformation benefiting Trump's presidential campaign.
The unwelcome attention to the three companies piles onto the anxieties in the tech industry, which also faces scrutiny from the Justice Department, federal regulators, Congress and state attorneys general around the country.
Last week, the Justice Department sued Google for abusing its dominance in online search and advertising - the government's most significant attempt to protect competition since its groundbreaking case against Microsoft more than 20 years ago.

215,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1001/Files (250).DOCX","Atlantic Online",2020-07-20,"2500 words",NA,"Conor Friedersdorf",NA,"Steven Pinker Will Be Just Fine",FALSE,"Hundreds of academics in the linguistics community signed an open letter earlier this month attacking Steven Pinker, one of their field's most prominent scholars, for six tweets and a passage from one of his best-selling books. Whatever their intentions, they were never going to succeed in intimidating the famous, tenured Harvard professor. But they did send a message to less powerful scholars that certain opinions, publicly stated, could result in professional sanction.
The chilling effect that creates, especially among linguists without tenure, wouldn't be cause for alarm if the speech in question were obviously and egregiously improper; if it consisted, for example, of racial slurs or open bigotry. But the hundreds of academics who targeted Pinker were not merely reaffirming sensible, widely agreed upon taboos. They were trying to radically narrow the bounds of acceptable speech and inquiry. A closer look at the letter lays bare the specific ideological orthodoxies and political tests that at least hundreds of linguists now feel comfortable openly imposing on their colleagues.
[Eliot A. Cohen: A tale of two letters]
The first thing to note is the letter's acknowledgment that the denunciation itself and its call for the Linguistic Society of America to remove Pinker from its list of ""distinguished academic fellows and media experts"" are not grounded in any claim about Pinker's scholarly chops. The signatories have no concern about his ""academic contributions as a linguist, psychologist and cognitive scientist.""
So what do they have against Pinker? Four passages convey the argument.
The first passage:
We set aside questions of Dr. Pinker's tendency to move in the proximity of what The Guardian called a revival of ""scientific racism"", his public support for David Brooks (who has been argued to be a proponent of ""gender essentialism""), his expert testimonial in favor of Jeffrey Epstein (which Dr. Pinker now regrets), or his dubious past stances on rape and feminism.
In the first clause of this indictment, the signatories do not accuse Pinker of ""scientific racism"" with the attendant obligation to substantiate the charge. They merely claim that Pinker tends to ""move"" in ""the proximity"" of what one newspaper ""called"" a revival of scientific racism. These are the same tenuous, abuse-prone, guilty-by-association tactics that the far right has used to tar academics by linking them to Communism or Islamism. The letter links to a Pinker Tweet that states, ""The Bell Curve: I don't agree with it on race, but public discussion of the book has been ignorant and dishonest""""""in other words, a Tweet that repudiates rather than validates the part of the book that critics attacked as racist""""and to a 2006 article Pinker published in The New Republic reviewing the work of three researchers from the University of Utah who argued, per Pinker's description of their Journal of Biosocial Science paper, ""that Ashkenazi Jews have a genetic advantage in intelligence, and that the advantage arose from natural selection for success in middleman occupations (moneylending, selling, and estate management) during the first millennium of their existence in northern Europe, from about 800 C.E. to 1600 C.E."" Pinker reviewed evidence for and against their hypothesis at length, reached no solid conclusion of his own, highlighted the potential downsides of such research and the problems with banning it, and did all this in a context he understood as follows:
The idea of innate Jewish intelligence is certainly an improvement over the infamous alternative generalization, a worldwide Jewish conspiracy. And attention to the talents needed in the middleman niche (whether they are biological or cultural) could benefit other middleman minorities, such as Armenians, Lebanese, Ibos, and overseas Chinese and Indians, who have also been targets of vicious persecution because of their economic success. And yet the dangers are real.
This seems rather far afield and easily distinguishable from favoring a revival of scientific racism.
The second clause, about David Brooks, is doubly remarkable: first, because the signatories imply that publicly supporting the centrist New York Times columnist and bestselling author is somehow beyond the pale for linguists in good standing, and second, because they conflate agreement with a newspaper column with public support for the columnist.
Next, the signatories suggest that a linguist who provides expert textual analysis of a criminal statute""""which is the service Pinker provided for Epstein, apparently at the behest of Pinker's Harvard colleague Alan Dershowitz""""is thereby sullied with the crimes of the defendant. Such an attitude would, of course, interfere with the ability to mount adequate legal defenses and challenge prosecutors.
The last clause, about Pinker's allegedly dubious stances on rape and feminism, points to the feminist Kate Manne's critiques of the linguist's comments on the statistical frequency of deadly hate crimes against women, an empirical question, and on whether rape is exclusively about power or partly about sex, a matter of ongoing scholarly debate.
The letter's passage conveys these messages to linguists: avoid anything that could be seen as ""moving in the proximity"" of problematic beliefs, avoid Tweeting links to the work of any newspaper columnist who has any problematic belief or risk being tarred with that belief, avoid giving expert analysis of language in the criminal cases if the defendant stands accused of heinous crimes, and don't depart from feminist orthodoxies. Already, the signatories have implied a severely constrained, highly ideological view of acceptable behavior, even before their primary critique.
The second passage:
We aim to show here Dr. Pinker as a public figure has a pattern of drowning out the voices of people suffering from racist and sexist violence, in particular in the immediate aftermath of violent acts and/or protests against the systems that created them. Below, we document six relevant occasions that show how Dr. Pinker's behavior is systematically and directly at odds with the LSA's stated aims.
The ""six relevant occasions"" of ostensibly bad behavior include one passage from Pinker's best-selling book The Better Angels of Our Nature and a handful of tweets.
In this telling, a scholar can be guilty of ""drowning out the voices of people suffering from racist and sexist violence"" not as a result of speaking over anyone or suppressing their speech, but merely by publishing claims of his own. What's more, the signatories imply that scholars can transgress against professional standards if they speak at the wrong time, namely ""in the immediate aftermath of violent acts and/or protests against the systems that created them.""
[Graeme Wood: The cowardice of open letters]
Notice, too, how this passage stereotypes ""people suffering from racist and sexist violence"" as if they are a monolith that shares the highly particular views of the signatories. One allegedly problematic Pinker tweet stating ""Don't abolish the police,"" in fact, expresses a viewpoint that is shared by a majority of every demographic group in America. People of every race and gender subscribe to the views he has expressed""""for example, that a mass shooting at UC Santa Barbara was statistically anomalous, that too many Black and white people are killed by police, that both over-policing and under-policing are problems.
The third passage:
On June 3rd 2020, during historic Black Lives Matter protests in response to violent racist killings by police of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and many many others, Dr. Pinker chose to publicly co-opt the academic work of a Black social scientist to further his deflationary agenda.
The letter included a screenshot of this Pinker tweet from June:
Harvard Social Science Dean Lawrence Bobo did the research I've cited on the decline of overt racism in the US. Here he reflects (w cautious optimism) on race relations in the the context of police killings of black men https://t.co/LAJeFjtCey via @Harvard pic.twitter.com/zXdejdBv3q
 - Steven Pinker (@sapinker) June 3, 2020
Applying the standards the signatories set forth, a linguist may violate professional standards by citing a Black academic, with the core scholarly practice of citation selectively reframed as co-option.
The signatories go on to claim that Pinker ""misrepresents"" the work of that scholar. That is at least the sort of claim that ought to affect the reputation and standing of an academic, but the signatories do not substantiate it. In their telling, the social scientist in question ""mainly expressed the hope he felt that the protests might spark genuine change, in keeping with his belief in the ultimate goodness of humanity."" Even if that is an accurate characterization, it does not follow that Pinker misrepresented the scholar's work.
The fourth passage:
On June 14th 2020, Dr. Pinker uses the dogwhistle ""urban crime/violence"" in two public tweets (neither of his sources used the term) ""Urban"", as a dogwhistle, signals covert and, crucially, deniable support of views that essentialize Black people as lesser-than, and, often, as criminals.
Here are Pinker's two tweets:
Don't abolish the police. Patrick Sharkey, researcher on urban violence &amp; its decline, writes: ""Cops prevent violence. But they aren't the only ones who can do it."" https://t.co/L8e4EIIyfb
 - Steven Pinker (@sapinker) June 14, 2020
Another expert on urban Crime, Ron Brunson, points out: Protests focus on over-policing. But under-policing is also deadly. https://t.co/BvuoYDBPaH
 - Steven Pinker (@sapinker) June 14, 2020
The notion that Pinker departed from language used by or generally associated with his sources is dishonest. Patrick Sharkey published a 2018 New York Times op-ed titled ""Two Lessons of the Urban Crime Decline."" On the cover of Sharkey's book Uneasy Peace: The Great Crime Decline, the Renewal of City Life, and the Next War on Violence, the urban-studies theorist Richard Florida states, ""Sharkey, the leading young scholar of urban crime and concentrated poverty, brilliantly dissects the causes of the great urban crime decline that has brought our great cities back to life, and outlines what it will take to ensure that our cities remain safe, secure, better, and more equitable places for all.""
When The New Yorker quoted Sharkey, it used the phrase urban crime too. Rod Brunson has used the term urban crime in his published writing. Nothing in either of Pinker's straightforward Tweets essentializes Black people or ""signals"" or implies that Black people are lesser than, and the phrase urban crime is not at all suspect when identifying scholars who specifically study and publish on crime in cities. As Pinker himself later observed, ""Dog-whistling is an intriguing exegetical technique in which you can claim that anyone says anything, because you can easily hear the alleged dog-whistles that aren't in the actual literal contents of what the person says.""
No one engaged in public life could be confident of avoiding speech that might be deemed problematic by the standards used in the Pinker letter. I have not addressed every complaint it raises. A few are in the realm of legitimate criticism. Had I edited his book Better Angels, I'd have advised Pinker against describing Bernie Goetz, who shot four men on the New York City subway in 1984, as ""mild-mannered."" But one needn't side with Pinker or against his detractors on every particular to disapprove of the signatories' methods: poring over years of individual tweets, asserting uncharitable interpretations of those they highlight, assigning guilt by association, and imposing multiple orthodoxies that are incompatible with academic freedom. (They also made factual errors, as noted by Mother Jones.)
[Yascha Mounk: Americans strongly dislike PC culture]
Why did hundreds of academics sign the letter and endeavor to have Pinker removed from the Linguistic Society of America's list of ""distinguished academic fellows and media experts""? The explanation they offered is hard to accept. ""Often, fellows are seen as the first line of academic linguistic authority, and trustworthy sources of linguistic knowledge,"" they wrote. ""Lay people and members of the press reach out to fellows and media experts for official statements. We feel that fellows therefore have a responsibility that comes with the honor, credibility, and visibility allotted them by their distinguished appointment."" But Pinker's prestige doesn't come from the list. And his visibility to members of the press and the public far exceeds that of the list.
Shaun Cammack, a graduate student at the University of Chicago, argued that, despite their stated aims, the signatories were sending a message to less powerful scholars:
This letter wasn't really about Pinker at all. In fact, it has a very specific function-to dissuade lesser-known academics and students from questioning the ideological consensus. The letter says, in not so few words: ""It doesn't matter if you're Steven f***ing Pinker. If you don't agree with our ideological prescriptions, you don't belong here.""
The letter is really directed towards you-the unknown academic, the young linguist, the graduate student. And in this particular goal of dissuading dissent, it will undoubtedly be successful You are not Steven Pinker, and Noam Chomksy and others probably aren't going to come to your defence when you get sanctioned for expressing the wrong opinion. Not because they don't believe in free speech, but because they won't even be aware of your case. There will be no articles lambasting and criticising the cancellers. Your cancellation will be a blip on the radar and the academic world will chug along without you.
Charleen Adams, a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health who holds a master's degree in applied linguistics, called the letter's demands ""reactive and authoritarian,"" and likened it to a performative ritual by a mob seeking purification. The Columbia University linguistics professor John McWhorter, an Atlantic contributor, wrote on Twitter, ""An organization dedicated to linguistic analysis must punish a leading, brilliant scholar because in the wake of George Floyd's murder, his politics aren't sufficiently leftist? Folks, it's time to stand this gospel down.""
To me, the motivations behind the letter, however well-intentioned or malign, altruistic or power-seeking, quasi-religious or rational, matter less than what the attack reveals about the academy. The desire to significantly narrow the bounds of acceptable speech is not a fringe proposition; it is a project that hundreds of people in a single academic field are willing to pursue openly. While tenured professors can reject newly expansive views of verboten speech and ideas without fearing the loss of their livelihood, scholars without tenure and younger linguists applying to graduate school or working toward graduate degrees will feel most constrained."

Marchers demanding police reform and racial equality clashed with M.T. Pockets bar patrons Tuesday night, as the patrons hurled vile taunts and phrases, including the n-word, toward protestors. 'You're killing my business,' Philip Alagna, the bar's owner, shouted from the patio as tensions escalated between the bar's patrons and protesters, who had returned to the scene of an ugly incident[2] Friday evening. 
Alagna is well known in Democratic politics and his bar, a few blocks west of Parkside Avenue, has frequently hosted fundraisers for party candidates. He is married to New York State Supreme Court Justice Diane Devlin. In the past 15 years, he has been a prolific donor to Democratic candidates, who have often used his bar for fundraisers. Alagna — a retired Buffalo Sewer Authority employee who draws an annual pension of $22,773 a year — has personally made almost $47,000 in political contributions in the past 15 years, according to records maintained by the New York State Board of Elections. Most of that — $29,000 — went to the Erie County Democratic Committee. He also gave $5,700 to his wife's campaigns in 2005 and 2019. Alagna gave $2,725 to the state Senate campaign of Marc Coppola, who briefly served in the seat previously occupied by his cousin, Al Coppola, to whom Alagna also donated. Alagna donated $2,000 to Mayor Byron Brown, nearly $1,000 to Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz, and $750 to Erie County Democratic Committee Chairman Jeremy Zellner. On Wednesday afternoon, Zellner said the Erie County Democratic Committee would no longer accept donations from Alagna, nor would the party hold events there. 'The displays of racism on Hertel Avenue we have seen in recent days have no place in our community and are in stark contrast to all that our Democratic Party stands for,' Zellner said in a statement on social media. Poloncarz said he would not patronize the bar nor hold fundraisers there in the future. He said he'd spoken with a friend of Agnala, who described Agnala as 'remorseful.''Hopefully he'll be issuing a statement noting that to the public,' Poloncarz said. 'I think it's important that he does.'Alagna's only donation to a non-Democrat was $500 to an Erie County Conservative Party campaign committee that sometimes backs Democrats. That was in December 2018, the year before Devlin ran for re-election. Our Weekly Newsletter This iframe contains the logic required to handle Ajax powered Gravity Forms.[3] Follow Us https://www.facebook.com/investigativepost https://twitter.com/ipostnewsAlagna's relatives — several of them city firefighters — have augmented his own political patronage, adding more than $11,000 in campaign contributions to the same candidates he has backed, including Devlin, his wife. Phil's brother, Alessio, a Buffalo Sewer Authority employee, was suspended from his job Wednesday for mooning the protesters Tuesday evening. Alessio Alagna has donated $1,829 to Byron Brown. 'Buffalo Sewer does not condone this kind of behavior from any of its employees, especially when they are representing Buffalo Sewer,' Oluwole McFoy, the authority's general manager, said in a statement, which noted an investigation had been opened. Alessio Alagna appeared to be wearing a yellow BSA t-shirt during the incident. In past years, the bar has been a hotbed of political activity. It served as a sort of headquarters for the Delaware Club, a North Buffalo Democratic organization. It has hosted fundraisers for a long list of Democratic politicians, including Thomas Amodeo, Lynn Marinelli, Joel Feroleto, Mark Schroeder, Sam Hoyt, Michelle Iannello and Mark Poloncarz, to name a few. More than 100 complaints were launched against the bar Tuesday into Wednesday. The Erie County Department of Health's Division of Environmental services is investigating the bar after videos surfaced showing an over-crowded patio with few people wearing masks. A notice was taped to the door Wednesday afternoon. Erie County Executive Poloncarz said in a press conference the notice was a recommendation that the restaurant close due to failure to comply with COVID regulations. Mayor Byron Brown subsequently announced the bar had agreed to shut its doors. The county Health Department has received complaints previously regarding M.T. Pockets violating COVID regulations. On June 30, the inspectors found 'an imminent health hazard condition.' The issue was remedied when one of the bartenders put on his face mask correctly, the inspection noted. Two other COVID-related complaints were filed against the bar in July. Apart from COVID compliance issues, M. T. Pockets has a relatively clean record with county health inspectors. Its handful of violations include, for example, failure to keep a thermometer in a refrigeration unit.In addition, the state filed a warrant in 2019 for $759 in unpaid taxes, and in 2015 for $1,044 related to unemployment insurance payments. A spokesman for the State Liquor Authority said the bar has not been cited for any violations over the past 20 years. He said a determination by a county health department that a bar had violated COVID mandates could trigger a review by the SLA.

(AP) — The events of 2020 already had Eddie Hall on edge.
Then, the troubles of a nation in turmoil landed on Hall's doorstep in suburban Detroit in September when racist graffiti was scrawled on his pickup truck and shots were fired into his home after his family placed a Black Lives Matter sign in their front window.
“I’m in combat mode. I’m protecting my family,” Hall, a 52-year-old Black man from Warren, told The Associated Press.
Some experts say police brutality, the coronavirus pandemic that has taken disproportionate physical and financial tolls on Black people, and other issues around race have increased anxiety levels among African Americans, like Hall.
The attacks on Hall's home were investigated as a hate crime and 24-year-old white neighbor, Michael Frederick Jr., eventually was arrested and charged with ethnic intimidation and other crimes.
“We, as Black people, have all of the normal human stressors — work, family, finances — and then we’re inundated with racial pressure at all levels,” said Jessica Graham-Lopresti, assistant professor of psychology at Suffolk University and co-founder of Massachusetts-based BARE — Black Advocacy Resilience Empowerment.
“This idea that, for Black people, we don’t feel — currently in this country — that we have the ability to control our environment and protect ourselves and our families,” she said. “We could still be gunned down in the street. That creates anxiety. That creates stress.”
In May, mostly white men and women protesting Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s orders that closed many businesses and services to stem the spread of COVID-19 openly carried rifles and handguns into the state Capitol.
As many activists take to the streets to maintain public political pressure for change, concern about personal safety is at an all-time high, said Frederick Gooding Jr., an African American studies professor at Texas Christian University.
“Especially in the aftermath of Kyle Rittenhouse walking untouched in full view with an assault rifle AFTER shooting another civilian dead,” Gooding added.
Rittenhouse, a white 17-year-old from northern Illinois, is accused of fatally shooting two white protesters and wounding a third in August in Kenosha, Wisconsin, during demonstrations following the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man. Rittenhouse was among a number of armed white men who converged on the city, claiming they were protecting property from arson and theft.
After the gunfire, with his AR-15-style rifle over his shoulder and his hands in the air, Rittenhouse walked toward police vehicles that kept going past him, even as a witness shouted, “He just shot them!” Police Chief Daniel Miskinis has explained the response as officers dealing with a chaotic scene.
Sharon Bethune, 56, of Fredericksburg, Virginia, said the events in Kenosha angered her and other Black people.
“This is mind-boggling,” said Bethune, a retiree who managed government accounts for the Environmental Protection Agency. “I’ve never seen anything like this.”
For Black professionals and those in the middle class, the anxiety appears to be more pronounced, said Alford Young Jr., a sociology professor at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.
They wonder “how we got to this moment of national leadership after the civil rights movement,” Young said. “There is just extreme anxiety and frustration that people would not have imagined that the kinds of issues surfacing now would have followed an Obama presidency.”
Many working class Black people see the current political landscape with less dread and more “the way it's always been,” he added.
Candace Hall, Eddie Hall’s wife, said Republican President Donald Trump shoulders part of the blame for how many African Americans are feeling.
Trump, who claims to have done more for Black people than his predecessors, has been accused of using race to stoke division. He has encouraged police to use a heavy-handed approach on people protesting against racism and police brutality. During his first debate with Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, Trump refused to condemn white supremacy.
“He’s opened up Pandora’s box with racism and anger and telling police to beat people up,” said Candace Hall, 55, also an Army veteran.
Ciaran O’Connor, spokesman for New York-based Braver Angels, which seeks to depolarize American politics, said people need to talk to each other, not retreat from tough conversations, as they fight for what they believe in.
“We believe in the power of conversation if you are trying to persuade people in a way to humanize people,” O'Connor said. ""If we’re gonna bring positive change, we’re going to have to find ways to have these conversations.”"

What is Black Lives Matter all about?
Black Lives Matter is an international human rights movement, originating in the African-American community in the United States, that campaigns against violence and systemic racism towards black people.
The movement was started in 2013 following the acquittal of George Zimmerman after he killed Trayvon Martin in 2013. Today, the Black Lives Matter Foundation, Inc. is a global organisation that is active across the world and has a UK-based charity. 
The guiding principles are to eradicate white supremacy and intervene in violence inflicted on Black communities through advocacy, fundraising and education.
Writing for Harpers Bazaar in 2019 Rachel Elizabeth Cargle said that Black Lives Matter is ""a rallying cry for a shift in statistical numbers that show that people who are black are twice as likely to be killed by a police officer while unarmed, compared to a white individual.""

The movement also calls for change in the way black people are treated. Black people in the US are twice as likely to be killed by a police officer while unarmed, compared to a white individual. According to a 2015 study, African Americans died at the hands of police at a rate of 7.2 per million, while whites were killed at a rate of 2.9 per million.
Why is saying ""all lives matter"" offensive?
It may feel a natural reaction to respond to one group centering its experience with, ""but what about all lives? Shouldn't all lives matter?"". 
The truth is black people are disproportionately impacted by police violence and systematic racism in the UK.
Statistics show black men are more likely to be sent to prison than their white counter-parts for committing the same crime, they are more likely to be stopped by the police and officers are more likely to use force when arresting black men. 
Troubling figures also show black women in the UK are four times more likely to die during childbirth than white women. Black women are also seven times more likely to be arrested than white women. 
As well as facing systemtic racism, black people suffer from everyday microagressions. These incidents are verbal, nonverbal and environmental slights, snubs, or insults, whether intentional or unintentional, which communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative messages to target persons based solely upon their marginalized group membership.
This could be asking to touch a black person's hair, asking where they are ""really"" from and generally being derogatory. According to a psychological study carried out in New York, these incidents have a damaging and detrimental affect on people.
Respondents said that ""backhanded communications"" can make them feel as if they don't belong, that they are abnormal or that they are untrustworthy. Some described the terrible feeling of being watched suspiciously in stores as if they were about to steal something, for instance. Some reported anticipating the impact of their race by acting preemptively: One man noted how he deliberately relaxes his body while in close quarters with white women so he doesn't frighten them.
In a report by The Guardian revealed black people experience microaggressions on daily basis such as being mistaken for staff at a restaurant, or being wrongly suspected of shop lifting. 
""Racism and discrimination for BAME people and minority faith groups isn't restricted to one area of life,"" said Zubaida Haque, the trust's deputy director told The Guardian. ""If you're not welcome in a restaurant as a guest because of the colour of your skin, you're unlikely to get a job in the restaurant for the same reason. Structural and institutional racism is difficult to identify or prove, but it has much more far-reaching effects on people's life chances.""
The phrase ""all lives matter"" ignores the reality that black people face and ignores the systemic racism that exists both in the UK and the US. 
Campaigners say the term ""Black Lives Matter"" isn't equivalent to saying other lives don't, but rather that Black lives should matter as much as white lives.

Alicia Garza, one of the creators of the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag, explained in 2014 how Black lives mattering is a precondition for all lives mattering:
She said: ""Black Lives Matter doesn't mean your life isn't important - it means that Black lives, which are seen as without value within White supremacy, are important to your liberation. Given the disproportionate impact state violence has on Black lives, we understand that when Black people in this country get free, the benefits will be wide-reaching and transformative for society as a whole. When we are able to end the hyper-criminalization and sexualization of Black people and end the poverty, control and surveillance of Black people, every single person in this world has a better shot at getting and staying free. When Black people get free, everybody gets free.""
I'm begging you. If you say all lives matter please read this. Understand that black lives matter is not saying nobody else matters pic.twitter.com/2DGT1hInWG

While Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor of Princeton University told the New York Times that the idea that ""all lives matter"" has always been an assumption.
He told the paper: ""The entire point of Black Lives Matter is to illustrate the extent to which black lives have not mattered in America.""
Why are British people protesting?
While the Black Lives Matter movement started in the US, it is widely acknowledged that systemic racism is as much a problem in the UK is it is overseas.
Action in the UK began last weekend, as supporters knelt in symbolic solidarity with George Floyd and other sufferers of police brutality.
As well as echoing US grievances, British activists point to hate crimes in the UK. Campaigners wield placards stating ""The UK is not innocent,"" alongside names and faces of victims of racial violence in the country.
In a recent incident, Belly Mujinga - a Black railway worker - died from coronavirus having been spat at by a man claiming to have the virus. British Transport Police said there was no evidence to substantiate criminal offence.
What does Black Lives Matter have to do with Basingstoke?
Basingstoke is a multicultural town and the far-reaching concequences of structural racism are felt all over the country. 
Organisers of Basingstoke's protests have said they want to highlight the discussion of privilege and racism locally to raise awareness.

Community leaders have expressed their sympathies to the plight of George Floyd and said it is important not to be complacent about the fight against racism.
In a statement Cllr Ken Rhatigan, leader of Basingstoke council, and Cllrs McCormick, Tilbury and James said: ""We must do all we can as civic leaders in demonstrating how we value inclusivity and will protect and champion those who are experiencing violence or discrimination. We pledge together to continue to recognise and celebrate diversity and continue to make our borough a place where everyone is welcome and treated fairly and with respect.""
When are the next protests in Basingstoke? 
There is a peaceful protest taking place in Eastrop Park on Saturday, June 6, at 12pm.
There is a second peaceful demo planned for Saturday, June 13, at War Memorial Park. 
But what about lockdown?
Mass gatherings remain forbidden and lockdown restrictions are in still in place.
Protest organisers have been asking participants to wear protective gear and observe social distancing.
Many protests, including those in Basingstoke, have successfully maintained distance.
Those attending have defended their decision to protest, saying the plight of racial inequality is a worthy cause. Some have gone into self-imposed self-isolation for two weeks, after the protest, to ensure they do not pass on any suspected illnesses. 
Tips for those protesting 
Organisers are circulating information and advice as follows:
Stay peaceful Wear protective masks and gloves Bring anti-bacterial gel Follow the two-metre social distancing guidelines Bring identification and emergency contact information Wear comfortable clothes and shoes Take sun-protection In case of arrest, carry essential medicines (e.g. inhalers) on your person Women on periods are advised to wear pads instead of tampons in case toilet access is restricted"

But if I tell you he was Jonathan Sacks - Rabbi Lord Sacks, to give him his full title - I suspect your reaction will be rather different. Because one consequence of his brilliance was that his renown was global. Rabbi Sacks will be missed, however, not just because he was a brilliant man, with a mind of rare clarity and suppleness, but precisely because he was a rabbi - or, rather, a spiritual leader. 
Not only are there now so few moral philosophers, let alone faith leaders, whose writings and words carry any weight, there are almost none whose insights and views are valued outside their own faith. 
Jonathan Sacks, however, was the exception, revered by Christians, Muslims, Hindus and other religious groups alike - as well as those of no faith. He was a former Chief Rabbi, and in that sense was as religious a figure as one can imagine.
But even in that guise, he used his pulpit to speak far beyond Britain's 284,000 Jews. Many will know him from his regular slots on Radio 4's Thought For The Day, others from his frequent TV appearances. He was once aptly described as the
Jewish ambassador to the rest of the UK.
One reason he was able to leap beyond the confines of being a religious leader was that he had the rarest of gifts - an ability to communicate complex ideas in ways that all of us could understand. But more than that, while so many faith leaders are afraid to say anything lest someone, somewhere take offence, he was willing when appropriate to speak with moral force.
Rabbi Sacks addressed real issues with real insight - all based on a conception of morality drawn from decades of learning from both Jewish and other, including secular, texts.
Take one of his most powerful recent interventions. In August 2018, at the height of the Labour anti-Semitism scandal, Lord Sacks said, quite unambiguously, that Jeremy
Corbyn was an anti-Semite and that the then Labour leader's comment that ""Zionists"" have ""no sense of irony"" despite ""having lived in this country for a very long time"" was the most offensive statement by a British politician since Enoch Powell's infamous ""rivers of blood"" speech in 1968.
This was genuine moral leadership. While other religious leaders had continually tiptoed carefully around Mr Corbyn, displaying moral cowardice in their refusal to call him out, Lord Sacks said it straight. His words were dynamite - and they had influence because of the standing in which he was held.
Had he just been a rabbi, it is unlikely he would have had such an impact. What set Lord Sacks apart was that he was no less important as a thinker for those who are not Jewish. He wrote over 30 books, many of which were best-sellers and almost all of which were for readers of all faiths and none.
He was, in that sense, a rare British example of the ""public intellectual"" so beloved of the French. In that capacity his standing as a rabbi was almost irrelevant .
We Brits are instinctively sceptical of anyone described as an intellectual but we do, sometimes, make exceptions: in years gone by, the likes of Isaiah Berlin and Jacob Bronowski combined academic esteem with a strong public profile and Jonathan Sacks carried on in that vein.
But he was something more, too. He did not merely explain and interpret vital questions - he answered them, with his Judaism always guiding and shaping his approach.
On a personal note, he was a truly kind man. When I became editor of the Jewish Chronicle, he spent time helping me understand the community's issues. And when I was diagnosed with cancer, he rang to check on my progress. I feel honoured to have known him.
Now I feel bereft at the thought he has gone. I ask, who is there now to provide a true moral lead? Who is there who, through their sheer humanity and decency, can we look up to for answers to the complex questions that we all live with?
At a time when we need moral clarity and decency more than ever, how cruel it is that he has gone. And how much we will miss him.

Then, the troubles of a nation in turmoil landed on Hall's doorstep in suburban Detroit in September when racist graffiti was scrawled on his pickup truck and shots were fired into his home after his family placed a Black Lives Matter sign in their front window.
“I’m in combat mode. I’m protecting my family,” Hall, a 52-year-old Black man from Warren, told The Associated Press.
Some experts say police brutality, the coronavirus pandemic that has taken disproportionate physical and financial tolls on Black people, and other issues around race have increased anxiety levels among African Americans, like Hall.
The attacks on Hall's home were investigated as a hate crime and 24-year-old white neighbor, Michael Frederick Jr., eventually was arrested and charged with ethnic intimidation and other crimes.
“We, as Black people, have all of the normal human stressors — work, family, finances — and then we’re inundated with racial pressure at all levels,” said Jessica Graham-Lopresti, assistant professor of psychology at Suffolk University and co-founder of Massachusetts-based BARE — Black Advocacy Resilience Empowerment.
“This idea that, for Black people, we don’t feel — currently in this country — that we have the ability to control our environment and protect ourselves and our families,” she said. “We could still be gunned down in the street. That creates anxiety. That creates stress.”
In May, mostly white men and women protesting Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s orders that closed many businesses and services to stem the spread of COVID-19 openly carried rifles and handguns into the state Capitol.
As many activists take to the streets to maintain public political pressure for change, concern about personal safety is at an all-time high, said Frederick Gooding Jr., an African American studies professor at Texas Christian University.
“Especially in the aftermath of Kyle Rittenhouse walking untouched in full view with an assault rifle AFTER shooting another civilian dead,” Gooding added.
Rittenhouse, a white 17-year-old from northern Illinois, is accused of fatally shooting two white protesters and wounding a third in August in Kenosha, Wisconsin, during demonstrations following the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man. Rittenhouse was among a number of armed white men who converged on the city, claiming they were protecting property from arson and theft.
After the gunfire, with his AR-15-style rifle over his shoulder and his hands in the air, Rittenhouse walked toward police vehicles that kept going past him, even as a witness shouted, “He just shot them!” Police Chief Daniel Miskinis has explained the response as officers dealing with a chaotic scene.
Sharon Bethune, 56, of Fredericksburg, Virginia, said the events in Kenosha angered her and other Black people.
“This is mind-boggling,” said Bethune, a retiree who managed government accounts for the Environmental Protection Agency. “I’ve never seen anything like this.”
For Black professionals and those in the middle class, the anxiety appears to be more pronounced, said Alford Young Jr., a sociology professor at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.
They wonder “how we got to this moment of national leadership after the civil rights movement,” Young said. “There is just extreme anxiety and frustration that people would not have imagined that the kinds of issues surfacing now would have followed an Obama presidency.”
Many working class Black people see the current political landscape with less dread and more “the way it's always been,” he added.
Candace Hall, Eddie Hall’s wife, said Republican President Donald Trump shoulders part of the blame for how many African Americans are feeling.
Trump, who claims to have done more for Black people than his predecessors, has been accused of using race to stoke division. He has encouraged police to use a heavy-handed approach on people protesting against racism and police brutality. During his first debate with Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, Trump refused to condemn white supremacy.
“He’s opened up Pandora’s box with racism and anger and telling police to beat people up,” said Candace Hall, 55, also an Army veteran.
Ciaran O’Connor, spokesman for New York-based Braver Angels, which seeks to depolarize American politics, said people need to talk to each other, not retreat from tough conversations, as they fight for what they believe in.
“We believe in the power of conversation if you are trying to persuade people in a way to humanize people,” O'Connor said. ""If we’re gonna bring positive change, we’re going to have to find ways to have these conversations.”"

McCray, had called to report that five white people were threatening him and taunting him with racial slurs at an apartment complex he owns. He ended up in custody.
A Virginia sheriff has apologized to a black pastor who was arrested earlier this month after he called 911 to report that a group of white people were trespassing on his property and taunting him with racial slurs.
The pastor, Leon K. McCray, 61, called the authorities during the confrontation, which began when he saw two people hauling a refrigerator to the dumpsters at the apartment building he owns in Edinburg, Va., on June 1.
Mr. McCray, who declined to comment when reached by phone, told WUSA-TV that the two people became angry when he asked them to leave the property. They quickly returned, he said, with three friends, who were also white. Mr. McCray said that the five people surrounded him and began using racial slurs, and that one head-butted him while another shoved him from behind.
In a sermon on June 7, a video recording of which he posted to YouTube, Mr. McCray told his congregation at the Lighthouse Church and Marketplace Ministries in Woodstock, Va., that one of the people “ran to me full speed snatching his shirt off, jumping in my face, and then he circled around behind me.”
“These same individuals were threatening my life telling me that my black life and the Black Lives Matter stuff, they don’t give a darn about that in this county and they could care less and ‘we will kill you,’” Mr. McCray said.
Fearing for his life, Mr. McCray told WUSA-TV that he pulled out his gun and “pointed it down to the ground in hopes that they would back off.”
Then he called 911. Deputies from the Shenandoah County Sheriff’s Office arrived and arrested Mr. McCray, who was charged with brandishing a firearm, a misdemeanor.
According to Virginia law, it is legal for a person to brandish a weapon in “justifiable self-defense.” Mr. McCray later told his congregation that he had a license to carry a concealed weapon.
The Shenandoah County sheriff, Timothy C. Carter, issued a statement late last week in which he said he had spoken with Mr. McCray on June 3, two days after the incident, and apologized. He said the five people who confronted Mr. McCray had been taken into custody on various charges, including hate crimes.
Sheriff Carter also said that he had placed two supervisors in his department on administrative leave, and that he had asked the Shenandoah County Attorney’s Office to drop the brandishing charge against Mr. McCray.
“After talking with him about the incident, it was apparent to me that the charge of brandishing was certainly not appropriate,” Sheriff Carter wrote. “Actually, as I told Mr. McCray, if I were faced with similar circumstances, I would have probably done the same thing.”
In an interview on Wednesday, Sheriff Carter said he had ordered an internal review into the incident. More broadly, he said his department was taking a look at its own conduct and policies in light of the national unrest over police brutality that followed the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
“We’re learning a lot from our involvement in this incident, and we’re trying to learn and be better as we move through this,” he said.
Court documents show that Mr. McCray still faces the brandishing charge. On Tuesday, the Shenandoah County Commonwealth attorney, Amanda McDonald Wiseley, filed what is known as a nolle prosequi motion to dismiss the charge. If a judge approves the motion, prosecutors will still have the authority to charge Mr. McCray.
Mr. McCray’s lawyer, Chris Kowalczuk, said in an interview that he would prefer for the charge to be dismissed “with prejudice,” meaning prosecutors will not have the power to refile it.
“There’s a big difference in discontinuing a prosecution that can be brought back and a dismissal,” Mr. Kowalczuk said.
The Shenandoah County Commonwealth Attorney’s Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In his June 7 sermon, Mr. McCray reflected on how Mr. Floyd’s death in police custody in Minneapolis had “changed something” in the fight against police brutality in the United States and around the world.
“It shifted something in myself and probably many people alike,” he said. “This tragedy of unbelievable death has catapulted this country and the world with a clarion call for change that will not be denied.”

After an outcry from activists, investigations were opened.
PALMDALE, Calif. -- Poncitlan Square in the center of this high desert city is a tidy expanse of green lawn with a gazebo and a fountain. On one side is City Hall, on the other, a fire station. There is a cafe and the Whispering Palms Apartments. This time last year, for the first time, it was filled with revelers celebrating Juneteenth, the annual holiday to mark the end of slavery. 
 Today, it is a place of mourning, anger and suspicion after a black man was found dead in the park, in the early hours of the day, hanging from a tree.
 Now, the grass around the Chinese Pistache tree is buried under balloons, candles, flowers and photographs of the man, Robert Fuller, one in his cap-and-gown, another with his sisters. A giant American flag flies overhead, as people gather around the tree, absorbed in despair for another black life lost.
 The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department first ruled the case a suicide. But it quickly shifted course by vowing a full investigation, a reaction in part to the protests, here and across the country, against police violence and racism.
 ''Black people don't do that,'' said Terry L. Scott, a realtor from Los Angeles, about an hour's drive west, expressing a sentiment shared by many in Palmdale. ''They don't hang themselves from a tree in a public park.''
 As tensions across the country grow in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, this desert region east of Los Angeles has been shaken not just by the death of Mr. Fuller but by a second, similar case, in nearby Victorville, where a black man was found dead, tied to a tree branch with a computer cord around his neck.
 That case, too, was first ruled a suicide, and officials in both cases say there is no sign of foul play. But now, in response to pleas from activists and family members, the local authorities are promising full investigations. And in a sign of the mistrust between the black community and law enforcement in the two cities, the F.B.I. is monitoring the inquiries, as are investigators with the state's attorney general's office.
 Taken together, the cases highlight not only the moment America finds itself in but also the long and well-documented history in Southern California of racial discrimination, police abuses and the lingering presence of white supremacist groups.
 Emotions were already raw over the killing of Mr. Floyd and the unrest it provoked, not to mention the accumulated grievances here over years of police abuses. Now, the potent symbolism of black men hanging from trees has put this city on edge -- the atmosphere within the black community is a ''powder keg,'' one local pastor said -- causing many to question law enforcement's handling of the cases.
 ''I think it was a rush to judgment,'' said Jamon R. Hicks, a Los Angeles civil rights lawyer hired by Mr. Fuller's family who is working to arrange an independent autopsy. ''What's so disturbing about that is there's this history they didn't consider. My first thought would not be a suicide. My first thought is, this is a modern-day lynching.''
 There have been at least three other hangings in public places in recent days that were ruled suicides, in Texas and New York City, sparking anguish and questions. A black teenager was found dead near an elementary school in Spring, Texas. A Hispanic man was found dead in Houston. And a black man was found dead in a tree in a Manhattan park.
 Officials in all these cases said there was no evidence they were not suicides. Nevertheless, the deaths have drawn attention on social media, with activists expressing fears they could be signs of a backlash against the Black Lives Matter movement, and others calling for federal investigations.
 In Northern California several nooses were found recently on five trees in a popular park in Oakland, prompting the F.B.I. to open a hate crimes investigation, even as some claimed the ropes were simply exercise equipment.
 Mayor Libby Schaaf of Oakland said that the intent of whoever put the ropes in the trees will be relevant to the criminal investigation, while acknowledging the potent symbolism.
 ''What a privilege for those of us that don't feel complete fear and terror when we see a rope in a tree,'' she said at a news conference on Wednesday. ''That is a privilege that so many of our African-American residents do not enjoy.''
 In Victorville, a city 50 miles east of Palmdale in San Bernardino County, residents gathered this week to demand the police investigate the death of Malcolm Harsch, 38, a homeless man who was living in a tent when his body was found hanging from a tree on May 31, 10 days before Mr. Fuller's death.
 According to a social worker briefed on the investigation by the San Bernardino Sheriff's Department, Mr. Harsch's body had no wounds to suggest he was attacked. The cable left one deep mark around his neck, typical of suicides, rather than several marks to indicate Mr. Harsch had struggled to free himself of the makeshift noose.
 But many residents are angered that the police were quick to judge the death a suicide and did not perform an autopsy until 12 days after the body was found. And his death was not announced until nearly two weeks later, they say, only after media scrutiny of the death of Mr. Fuller was brought to light. In both cases, police have not made public any suicide notes.
 The families of both Mr. Harsch and Mr. Fuller have cast doubt that their loved ones' deaths were suicides. At a rally in Palmdale recently Diamond Alexander, Mr. Fuller's sister, who lives in Arizona, said, ''my brother was not suicidal. He wasn't.''
 Karmen Smith, a mental health therapist, was so moved by the death of Mr. Fuller -- who attended a local high school, loved basketball and was described as outgoing and funny -- that she drove from Las Vegas to see the town square.
 She said she could not believe a black man would hang himself on a tree in a public park, given the history in America of lynching.
 When Ms. Smith walked into the park on Tuesday morning, she said, ''I just screamed. I was just so outraged and saddened.''
 Los Angeles County officials have now said they are searching for any video footage from the area around the park, and are analyzing the rope from Mr. Fuller's case.
 At the square in Palmdale, there is no escaping the backdrop of a nation at war with itself, as it grapples with a painful history. One man displayed old photographs of black men being lynched in America. Others spoke of the region's own troubles -- of housing discrimination, racial profiling, the presence of neo-Nazi groups, being taunted by racial slurs -- and passed out fliers about the next-door town titled, ''a brief overview of Lancaster's racist history.''
 The region was once predominantly white and expanded during World War II as the growing aerospace industry attracted families. In recent decades, the demographics have been shifting, as black and Latino residents fled Los Angeles in search of more affordable homes. This migration intensified racial tensions, residents say.
 ''I moved here 10 years ago from Compton,'' said Aleka Jackson, 48, a teacher, who lives in Victorville. ''I wanted to raise my children in a place that would be safer. But when you change location, you change your issues. I traded gang culture for racism.''
 Many black and Latino residents who moved to the region were low-income, using housing vouchers from the federal Section 8 program.
 This provoked an organized effort by the local authorities, in partnership with the Sheriff's Department, to target low-income residents for eviction, according to federal investigators who found a pattern of abusive police practices against African-Americans in 2013. The investigation resulted in a consent decree and federal monitoring.
 ''I feel like black lives have remained vulnerable out here,'' said Christian D. Green, a local pastor and adjunct professor of African-American history at several community colleges.
 The day after Mr. Fuller was found dead, a sheriff's deputy shot and killed a black man in his home in Lancaster following a domestic dispute. The sheriff's department said the man, Michael Thomas, had reached for a deputy's gun before being killed, a claim the man's fiancée disputed, according to news reports.
 Pastor Jacob D.R. Johnson of Growing Valley Baptist Church, a predominantly African-American congregation in Lancaster, said he hasn't been able to bring himself to visit the park where Mr. Fuller was found dead. ''I've had a hard time sleeping,'' he said.
 Mr. Johnson, the vice president of the local chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., like other black leaders here, are preparing themselves for the possibility that Mr. Fuller was murdered, and what the reaction might be on the streets.
 ''We're really saying, we're not going to be quick to judge,'' he said. ''Wisdom cries out, wait.''
 He is haunted by the racism in the region, whether it be painted swastikas popping up or, in a recent case that made news, a widely circulated photograph of teachers holding a noose.
 ''Hate crimes are not inconceivable,'' he said.
 Until there are answers, he added, ''we are asking people to keep their families close.''

Following the court decision that prevented them from wandering around in Swastikas, uniforms, and Nazi paraphernalia among victims of genocide, Collin turned to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to defend his right to freedom of expression and demonstration under the First Amendment to the Constitution. Aryeh Neier (Berlin, 83) fled Germany with his parents as a child and, after spending several years as refugees in the United Kingdom, arrived in the United States in 1947. Most of his family perished in the death camps. An activist for civil liberties and human rights since his time as a high school student, Neier presided over the ACLU at the time and accepted the case without hesitation. 
""I think I remember everything well, I may have forgotten a couple of things, but what happened I have recorded,"" he recalls in a proud voice on the phone from his home in New York. ""I never regretted it, I always thought I was doing the right thing. Skokie had a big impact on the concept that public opinion had about defending freedom and over time more and more people in America and perhaps somewhere else he thought we were right.""
Defending the Nazis as a Jew
""The right to meet and speak freely and without permission should be unanswerable,"" the first ACLU report read in 1920. However, the inhabitants of Skokie, a living memory of the murder of six million Jews, rebelled to the cry of ""Never Again"" and did not understand the stance of this organization. Neier's decision triggered a social storm, financial pressures on the ACLU (which was sustained by what his partners paid for), an intense media debate and a judicial process that the activist, founder after Human Rights Watch, told in Defending My Enemy, a book now published in Spanish by the Berg Institute with translation by Nuria Brufau.
The story has a strong symbolic burden since those American Nazis were a quirky and irrelevant force in terms of political representation and that they distributed as much hatred among their factions as they did to others. What was at stake in Skokie went much further. Like his admired John Milton—one of the great moral guides in his struggle alongside Hannah Arendt or Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg, with whom he worked closely—Neier believed that, on an equal footing, truth would always triumph. Hence, we should let everyone say what they wanted, nod how much it hurt. ""I'm not so sure today that truth always prevails against evil,"" he confesses with regret when social media, fake news or the culture of cancellation arise in conversation.
I never regretted it, I always thought I was doing the right thing. Skokie had a big impact on the concept that public opinion had on the defense of freedomAryeh Neier
Neier also draws in his book a precise picture of the history of the struggle for freedom of expression in the Anglo-Saxon world, from Elizabeth I's anti-libel laws in England to the 20th century in the United States, to prove that the arguments against the freedoms of the Nazis of Skokie were the same as those used during the , for example, the darkest years of the Macartist repression and thus comes to a clear conclusion: ""History is eloquent: the freedom of our enemies must be defended if we want it to bekeep ours."" ""I believe"", continues now in the interview, as if it were an extension of that text, ""that this is one of the great reasons for defending freedom of expression, because there is always a better chance that those who have less political power will be the victims of any prohibition of this right. It is vital for people to be able to report the abuse they suffer.""
Swastikas and amendments
""And I, being Jewish, how can I refuse to defend freedom, even if it is for the Nazis?"" sums up Neier in his essay. Although this lawyer's stance is more complicated since the European tradition of hate crimes, in the United States he had a strong legal apparatus behind him. The Illinois Supreme Court made this clear in its January 27, 1978 judgment on Skokie, in its section on swastika and demonstrations in military uniforms: ""The Constitutional First Amendment is free even to defend that the government could be deposed through the use of violence (...). Therefore, the prohibition of a symbol that is repugnant for a 'tradition' that every American has the freedom to publicly reject and criticize is clearly unconstitutional.""
Defending my enemy became when it was published in 1979 into a fundamental text. ""There is in Neier's actions a courage and determination forged in refugee status as were Raphael Lemkin and Fritz Bauer. In his legacy we find discipline, obedience, intelligence and humanism and above all a way to innovate and implement the paradigms of freedom that represent human rights. For Neier to defend the right to freedom of expression of the Nazi party of the United States represented the responsibility of living up to the ideals of democracy and the rule of law,"" says Joaquín González, co-director of the Berg Institute, which fills with this publication a gap of more than 40 years.
On July 9, 1978, after 16 months of controversy and court battles, a handful of Nazis demonstrated in Marquette Park, Chicago. It was the usual place for the deployment of their paraphernalia and they preferred it to Skokie, smaller and they only used to make themselves known when the judge forbade them, in the first instance, to concentrate on Marquette.

Scrutiny",FALSE,"When two men were found hanging from trees in Southern California, the authorities quickly ruled them suicides. After an outcry from activists, investigations were opened.
PALMDALE, Calif. — Poncitlan Square in the center of this high desert city is a tidy expanse of green lawn with a gazebo and a fountain. On one side is City Hall, on the other, a fire station. There is a cafe and the Whispering Palms Apartments. This time last year, for the first time, it was filled with revelers celebrating Juneteenth, the annual holiday to mark the end of slavery.
Today, it is a place of mourning, anger and suspicion after a black man was found dead in the park, in the early hours of the day, hanging from a tree.
Now, the grass around the Chinese Pistache tree is buried under balloons, candles, flowers and photographs of the man, Robert Fuller, one in his cap-and-gown, another with his sisters. A giant American flag flies overhead, as people gather around the tree, absorbed in despair for another black life lost.
The Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department first ruled the case a suicide. But it quickly shifted course by vowing a full investigation, a reaction in part to the protests, here and across the country, against police violence and racism.
“Black people don’t do that,” said Terry L. Scott, a realtor from Los Angeles, about an hour’s drive west, expressing a sentiment shared by many in Palmdale. “They don’t hang themselves from a tree in a public park.”
As tensions across the country grow in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, this desert region east of Los Angeles has been shaken not just by the death of Mr. Fuller but by a second, similar case, in nearby Victorville, where a black man was found dead, tied to a tree branch with a computer cord around his neck.
That case, too, was first considered a suicide, and officials in both cases say there is no sign of foul play. But now, in response to pleas from activists and family members, the local authorities are promising full investigations. And in a sign of the mistrust between the black community and law enforcement in the two cities, the F.B.I. is monitoring the inquiries, as are investigators with the state’s attorney general’s office.
Taken together, the cases highlight not only the moment America finds itself in but also the long and well-documented history in Southern California of racial discrimination, police abuses and the lingering presence of white supremacist groups.
Emotions were already raw over the killing of Mr. Floyd and the unrest it provoked, not to mention the accumulated grievances here over years of police abuses. Now, the potent symbolism of black men hanging from trees has put this city on edge — the atmosphere within the black community is a “powder keg,” one local pastor said — causing many to question law enforcement’s handling of the cases.
“I think it was a rush to judgment,” said Jamon R. Hicks, a Los Angeles civil rights lawyer hired by Mr. Fuller’s family who is working to arrange an independent autopsy. “What’s so disturbing about that is there’s this history they didn’t consider. My first thought would not be a suicide. My first thought is, this is a modern-day lynching.”
There have been at least three other hangings in public places in recent days that were ruled suicides, in Texas and New York City, sparking anguish and questions. A black teenager was found dead near an elementary school in Spring, Texas. A Hispanic man was found dead in Houston. And a black man was found dead in a tree in a Manhattan park.
Officials in all these cases said there was no evidence they were not suicides. Nevertheless, the deaths have drawn attention on social media, with activists expressing fears they could be signs of a backlash against the Black Lives Matter movement, and others calling for federal investigations.
In Northern California several nooses were found recently on five trees in a popular park in Oakland, prompting the F.B.I. to open a hate crimes investigation, even as some claimed the ropes were simply exercise equipment.
Mayor Libby Schaaf of Oakland said that the intent of whoever put the ropes in the trees will be relevant to the criminal investigation, while acknowledging the potent symbolism.
“What a privilege for those of us that don’t feel complete fear and terror when we see a rope in a tree,” she said at a news conference on Wednesday. “That is a privilege that so many of our African-American residents do not enjoy.”
In Victorville, a city 50 miles east of Palmdale in San Bernardino County, residents gathered this week to demand the police investigate the death of Malcolm Harsch, 38, a homeless man who was living in a tent when his body was found hanging from a tree on May 31, 10 days before Mr. Fuller’s death.
According to a social worker briefed on the investigation by the San Bernardino Sheriff’s Department, Mr. Harsch’s body had no wounds to suggest he was attacked. The cable left one deep mark around his neck, typical of suicides, rather than several marks to indicate Mr. Harsch had struggled to free himself of the makeshift noose.
But many residents are angered that the police were quick to judge the death a suicide and did not perform an autopsy until 12 days after the body was found. And his death was not announced until nearly two weeks later, they say, only after media scrutiny of the death of Mr. Fuller was brought to light. In both cases, police have not made public any suicide notes.
The families of both Mr. Harsch and Mr. Fuller cast doubt that their loved ones’ deaths were suicides. But on Saturday, Mr. Harsch’s family said through a spokesman that after reviewing footage provided by the Victorville police, his death was, in fact, a suicide.
At a recent rally in Palmdale, Diamond Alexander, Mr. Fuller’s sister, who lives in Arizona, said, “my brother was not suicidal. He wasn’t.”
Karmen Smith, a mental health therapist, was so moved by the death of Mr. Fuller — who attended a local high school, loved basketball and was described as outgoing and funny — that she drove from Las Vegas to see the town square.
She said she could not believe a black man would hang himself on a tree in a public park, given the history in America of lynching.
When Ms. Smith walked into the park on Tuesday morning, she said, “I just screamed. I was just so outraged and saddened.”
Los Angeles County officials have now said they are searching for any video footage from the area around the park, and are analyzing the rope from Mr. Fuller’s case.
At the square in Palmdale, there is no escaping the backdrop of a nation at war with itself, as it grapples with a painful history. One man displayed old photographs of black men being lynched in America. Others spoke of the region’s own troubles — of housing discrimination, racial profiling, the presence of neo-Nazi groups, being taunted by racial slurs — and passed out fliers about the next-door town titled, “a brief overview of Lancaster’s racist history.”
The region was once predominantly white and expanded during World War II as the growing aerospace industry attracted families. In recent decades, the demographics have been shifting, as black and Latino residents fled Los Angeles in search of more affordable homes. This migration intensified racial tensions, residents say.
“I moved here 10 years ago from Compton,” said Aleka Jackson, 48, a teacher, who lives in Victorville. “I wanted to raise my children in a place that would be safer. But when you change location, you change your issues. I traded gang culture for racism.”
Many black and Latino residents who moved to the region were low-income, using housing vouchers from the federal Section 8 program.
This provoked an organized effort by the local authorities, in partnership with the Sheriff’s Department, to target low-income residents for eviction, according to federal investigators who found a pattern of abusive police practices against African-Americans in 2013. The investigation resulted in a consent decree and federal monitoring.
“I feel like black lives have remained vulnerable out here,” said Christian D. Green, a local pastor and adjunct professor of African-American history at several community colleges.
The day after Mr. Fuller was found dead, a sheriff’s deputy shot and killed a black man in his home in Lancaster following a domestic dispute. The sheriff’s department said the man, Michael Thomas, had reached for a deputy’s gun before being killed, a claim the man’s fiancée disputed, according to news reports.
Pastor Jacob D.R. Johnson of Growing Valley Baptist Church, a predominantly African-American congregation in Lancaster, said he hasn’t been able to bring himself to visit the park where Mr. Fuller was found dead. “I’ve had a hard time sleeping,” he said.
Mr. Johnson, the vice president of the local chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., like other black leaders here, are preparing themselves for the possibility that Mr. Fuller was murdered, and what the reaction might be on the streets.
“We’re really saying, we’re not going to be quick to judge,” he said. “Wisdom cries out, wait.”
He is haunted by the racism in the region, whether it be painted swastikas popping up or, in a recent case that made news, a widely circulated photograph of teachers holding a noose.
“Hate crimes are not inconceivable,” he said.
Until there are answers, he added, “we are asking people to keep their families close.”

Most notably, the white working class – those without a four-year college degree – powered Trump to a narrow margin of victory in the industrial Midwest, where he won states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, although all by a cat's whisker. By contrast, affluent, college-educated suburban voters in bedroom communities surrounding metro-political areas moved more firmly into the Democratic column.
 While the Trump Republican message of American nationalism spoke to down-on-their-luck white, working class voters, it, by contrast, alienated the more globally minded, progressive professional class.
But as much attention as educational attainment has gotten as a very reliable predictor of voting habits, there is an important and indeed overlooked group which has very much been the subject of Trump's attention and whose votes he is trying – so far unsuccessfully – to draw into the GOP column: Jewish voters.
Since November 2016, Trump has assiduously worked the Jewish vote hard if not relentlessly – publicly demonstrating unequivocal support for the State of Israel and the Jewish people – even if sometimes very un-artfully. Obviously, Trump's overtures to Jewish voters are in part designed to curry favor with Christian Evangelical voters who hold very positive views toward Israel, but it is also a clear run at trying to break up the Jewish coalition's monolithic support for the Democratic Party.
What are we to make of Trump's focus on Israel, the latest evidence being the recent peace agreement in the Middle East between Israel, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates?
While Jewish voters represent just 3% of the national electorate of the US, their political support today disproportionately goes to Democrats. 71% of Jewish voters supported Hillary Clinton versus 23% for Trump in the 2016 presidential election. That's roughly in line with the 69% who supported Barack Obama in 2012 and the 30% who supported Mitt Romney in the 2012 election.

That said, Clinton's margin of 48 points among Jewish voters is off significantly from Al Gore's 60 point margin against George W. Bush in 2000 – a very significant swing of 12 points among Jewish voters away from Democrats.
And add to that, some recent polling which has demonstrated that Trump's standing with Evangelical voters faltered over the summer. For Trump to win reelection on Election Day in November, he needs to win a resounding victory with Evangelical Christians – he needs the votes of at least eight in 10 of them. Trump sees his unwavering support for Israel as one way he can rebuild his support with Evangelical Christian voters.
And on this journey, Trump has been aided in his quest to win Jewish votes by strong assists from the rising power of the Democratic Socialist faction in the Democratic Party.
In the last two years, New York City alone has experienced the loss of two major pro-Israel, senior Democratic members of congress, Joe Crowley and Eliot Engel, in Democratic primaries. Both Crowley and Engel lost to insurgent Democratic Socialist upstarts – Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Jamaal Bowman.
Bowman, who will waltz into Congress come January, will be starting off at the bottom of the Congressional totem pole. Bowman, of course, will not replace Engel on his perch as the chairman of the very powerful House Foreign Affairs Committee, where Engel has led vigorous investigations into Trump, been a strong and reliable voice against hate crimes and fighting antisemitism, championing a two-state solution, and having been recognized by organizations like the American Jewish Congress for promoting ties between the US and Israel among non Jews.
Engel lost to a candidate in Bowman who has created significant anxiety in the Jewish community. Indeed, in an open letter to Bowman, Rabbi Avi Weiss, the founding rabbi of the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale in the Bronx, cited a tweet sent by Bowman stating that Rep. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib ""do not hate Israel"". Weiss reminds us in his letter that Bowman went out of his way to defend these two members of congress, whose past statements have been condemned by the Anti-Defamation League, the Simon Wiesenthal Center and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Rabbi Weiss also noted in his letter that Bowman's Israel policy itself was ""too questionable"" to garner his support.
In full disclosure, we are non-unbiased observers, we were a part of Engel's team during his most recent loss and have worked on and off on his Congressional races for the last 20 years.
While the overall number of votes cast in the Crowley/AOC and Engel/Bowman races were very small, they are nevertheless changing the face of the national Democratic Party, moving it leftward ideologically, and putting its foreign policy positions somewhat at odds with the traditional policy platform of the Democratic Party.
The open question is whether Bowman's win – as well as the Democratic Socialist's rise in the Democratic Party – will further exacerbate the tensions between Democrats and Jewish voters.
And in the age of Trump, these two races are threatening to further fracture relations between the Democratic Party and the Jewish people.
It certainly didn't help matters that during the Democratic presidential campaign, the main Democratic contenders all blew off the opportunity to address the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee's conference in 2019 and only Mike Bloomberg had the courage to attend in 2020 in person. This would have been unthinkable even four years ago and is regrettable.
Some of those who powered AOC and Bowman to victory have suggested that Democrats must be far more forceful in our disagreements with the government of Israel – no longer blindly towing the line. But that argument misses the point. Indeed, according to polling by J Street, 80% of Jewish voters think that someone can indeed be critical of Israeli government policies and still be ""pro-Israel"" at the same time.
What Democrats must not forget is that whatever genuine policy disagreements that we may have with whatever government is in power in Israel, the country is a hugely important strategic ally in a volatile region of the world that we need to build even closer ties with. What Democrats need to argue for – loudly and unequivocally – is strong support for a two-state solution, strong commitment and determination to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Democrats need to be very careful not to inject words or phrases which can be construed as antisemitic or anti-Israeli into our rhetoric or social media channels. Words do indeed matter.

Burned American flags, the downing of a statue of Christopher Columbus in Baltimore, the run-over of protesters in Seattle were some of the scenes that were experienced in protests in different parts of the U.S., following President Donald Trump's speech.
On the occasion of July 4, he had called several anti-racist demonstrations and to call for the departure of Trump and his vice president, Mike Pence, in several US cities that ended the burning of flags in Washington DC, Los Angeles, Chicago and New York, according to one of the organizers, the Revolutionary Communist Party.
In the capital, participants set fire to the flag next to Lafayette Square, the park next to the White House to the cry of ""America Was Never Great,"" which contrasts with Trump's campaign slogan ""Make America Big Again.""
In the US the burning of the national flag is not illegal, and in fact at the Hollywood protest was 63-year-old activist Gregory ""Joey"" Johnson, who in 1989 won the case before the Supreme Court that recognized his right to burn the teaching.
Johnson set fire to three flags, the Confederate (of southern states and slavers during the Civil War), the American and the Blue Lives Matter movement, to protest Trump.
Blue Lives Matter, as opposed to the Black Lives Matter group, which protests police violence against African-Americans, advocates that those convicted of the killing of police officers be convicted of hate crimes.
Meanwhile, in Baltimore, Maryland, protesters toppled the statue of Christopher Colon located in the Little Italy area and threw it into the water at Inner Harbor, CNN reported yesterday.
A witness noted that after knocking it down with a rope, the statue broke into pieces that were dragged by the protesters into the water.
Meanwhile, one protester was killed and two injured after a car jumped a police barrier and lashed out at a protest in Seattle.
These events came after US President Donald Trump delivered a harsh speech at the White House for the Fourth of July, on Independence Day, in which he hath the polarization.
In his at the same time, the president stated: ""We are now in the process of defeating the radical left, the Marxists, the anarchists, the agitators, the looters and the people, who in many instances do not know at all what he is doing.""
He also said they will never allow ""an angry crowd"" to erase the country's history and tear down monuments.
In recent weeks, attacks on monuments of Confederate leaders, founding fathers of the US and explorers linked to the Spanish ""conquest"" of America, such as Christopher Columbus, have multiplied, which are perceived as symbols of racism."
229,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1001/Files (250).DOCX","Impact News Service",2020-10-16,"1259 words",NA,NA,NA,"Has Trump failed Black Americans?",FALSE,"Washington DC: Brookings Institution has issued the following press release:
“I have done more forBlack Americans than anybody, except for the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln.” Donald Trump has repeatedly made this statement. However, many Black Americans have not viewed Trump’s first presidential term similarly. We cover some of the key concerns below.
The Economy
It is true that Black unemployment was at an all-time low in February 2020, before COVID-19. Yet, the Black unemployment rate under the Obama-Biden administration had one of thelargest declines in American history following The Great Recession. Trump largely inherited a growing economy. However, when we look at the jobs picture, in addition to the unemployment rate, we are concerned about the quality of those jobs. Quality jobs pay living wages and benefits. Blacks still continue to be concentrated in lower sector jobs, which do not have adequate healthcare or paid sick leave and have disproportionately exposed them to COVID-19. For Black men, job prospects are even more limited. In addition to facing more barriers to work entry, the available jobs often do not provide enough money for them to provide financially for their families. For these men, the labor market has failed them. Thus, their unemployment is not factored into the rate. In fact, research notes that 1.5 million Black men aremissing from social and economic life.
Trump’s recentPlatinum Plan claims to increase investments in Black communities by creating Black-small businesses and jobs. Despite the rapperIce Cube’s contributions, for some it is too little, too late. The Pay Protection Plan (PPP) from the Small Business Administration leftBlack businesses out in the cold. Over 90% of Black-owned small businesses that applied for PPP funding were denied. This has led toover 40% of Black-owned small businesses being shuttered during COVID-19. These realities document a callousness towards Black business owners who already have difficulties securing loans for development, and if provided a loan, are more likely to be offered one athigher interest rates than similar white-owned businesses would obtain, thereby increasing their operating costs. If achieving racial equity were actually part of Trump’s agenda, the distribution of resources from the PPP would have explicitly included Black-and-other-minority-owned small businesses and would have allowed them to receive an equitable share.
Implicit Bias Training
During the first 2020 Presidential debate, Chris Wallace asked Trump, “Why did you endracial sensitivity training and do you believe there is systemic racism in this country?” Trump replied, “I ended it because it’s racist… a lot of people were complaining they were asked to do things that were absolutely insane. That it was a radical revolution… They were teaching people to hate our country.” Trump’s statements are ironic considering that hate crimes increased over 200% in places where he held a campaign rally in 2016. His language about “Liberate Michigan” and “Stand back and stand by” may have contributed to the kidnapping plots of Michigan and Virginia Governors.
In addition to Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric, the recentban on trainings usingcritical race theory and addressing white privilege are an admission that improving workplace culture is not part of a Trump administration. It is also a blatant denial of racial discrimination that has been protected under the law. All of the federal government needs these forms of training, starting with the White House.
Criminal Justice Reform and Policing
For many Black people, Trump’s law and order rhetoric and dismissal of the Movement for Black Lives unearths collective memories about his full-page advertisements in four New York newspapers includingThe New York Times, to crucify the now exonerated Central Park 5. In big, bold letters, Trump’s headline read: “Bring Back theDeath Penalty. Bring Back our Police!”
While it is true that Trump signed theFirst Step Act, a bipartisan bill originally introduced bySenator Cory Booker as the Next Step Act that seeks to decrease recidivism and prison population numbers by providing more vocational training and work opportunities for the formally incarcerated, the Administration’s Department of Justice has also taken steps which have undermined efforts to decrease racist and hostile encounters between Black and Brown Americans and law enforcement. The Trump administration haspurposely halted consent decrees and Department of Justice police department investigations. As a point of reference, theObama administration handed down the most consent decrees of any president.
Judges and the Courts
Blacks Americans should be aware of what may be Trump’s lasting legacy—his federal judge selections and his Supreme Court nominations. Thedemographics of the judges are telling. Trump has appointed the most Appeals Court judges since President Jimmy Carter.Not one of them is Black. With astrongly conservative set of judges, many of them will affect judicial outcomes for at least the next generation on topics of critical importance to Black Americans, including policing, sentencing, voting, healthcare, and racial equity. To highlight the impact of these judges, a recent panel, all appointed by Trump, blocked a lower court ruling and is allowing Texas Governor Greg Abbott to only haveone mail-in ballot drop off box in each county in the state.
If Trump was doing more for Black people, he would do all he could to ensure they have equitable access to vote. Voting Rights is a cornerstone civil right that Black communities fought to secure. There are millions of Black people who recall not being able to vote. Black people’s right to vote has not been protected and many will be potentially exposed to COVID-19 because of their distrust in the mail-in ballot process.
COVID-19 and Affordable Healthcare
This brings us to COVID-19. Simply put, the pandemic response by the Trump administration has been deadly. COVID-19 has disproportionately killed Black people atdouble the rate of Whites. However, it could have been different. When Trump took office, he dismantled thepandemic response unit created under the Obama-Biden administration. He also shut down thesocial and behavioral committee that helps inform the White House on how people embedded in social institutions like education, hospitals, prisons, grocery stores and restaurants, andneighborhoods might be disproportionately affected based on their urban or rural environments. These factors are the main reason why, to date, nearly 8 millionAmericans have contracted COVID-19 and nearly 220,000 have died.
Trump claims there is no way these deaths could have been prevented. What we know is that the viral infections are both biologically and socially pathogenic as they follow pathways or vectors of inequity to attack the most vulnerable. Structural conditions determine the susceptibility and severity of acute and chronic conditions. In a global report on pandemic responses, theUnited States ranked 175th on healthcare access out of nearly 200 countries. Early on during the pandemic, Black people were six times more likely to be turned away from COVID-19 testing and treatment once at the hospital.
In 2016, Trump asked Black Americans: “What do you have to lose?” This is such an infamous statement that rapperMeek Mill put it in the opening of his recent song. Well, what Black people have to lose are their lives as well as those of their loved ones if stuck with four more years of a Trump administration."

Seigel, ADL NextGen Advisory Board Member and VP in Global Markets Engineering at Goldman Sachs.
The first ADL In Concert Against Hate was held in 1995 as a special event to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of the Holocaust. The concert honored the memory of four individuals who are recognized as ""Righteous Among the Nations"" - non-Jews who rescued Jews from the Nazis. Response to the concert was so overwhelming that what was supposed to be a one-time celebration was transformed into an annual tradition, which brings thousands together to be inspired by the stories of real heroes and to stand up against all forms of bigotry, injustice and extremism.

Obviously, Trump's overtures to Jewish voters are in part designed to curry favor with Christian Evangelical voters who hold very positive views toward Israel, but it is also a clear run at trying to break up the Jewish coalition's monolithic support for the Democratic Party.
What are we to make of Trump's focus on Israel, the latest evidence being the recent peace agreement in the Middle East between Israel, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates?
While Jewish voters represent just 3% of the national electorate of the US, their political support today disproportionately goes to Democrats. 71% of Jewish voters supported Hillary Clinton versus 23% for Trump in the 2016 presidential election. That's roughly in line with the 69% who supported Barack Obama in 2012 and the 30% who supported Mitt Romney in the 2012 election.
That said, Clinton's margin of 48 points among Jewish voters is off significantly from Al Gore's 60 point margin against George W. Bush in 2000 - a very significant swing of 12 points among Jewish voters away from Democrats.
And add to that, some recent polling which has demonstrated that Trump's standing with Evangelical voters faltered over the summer. For Trump to win reelection on Election Day in November, he needs to win a resounding victory with Evangelical Christians - he needs the votes of at least eight in 10 of them. Trump sees his unwavering support for Israel as one way he can rebuild his support with Evangelical Christian voters.
And on this journey, Trump has been aided in his quest to win Jewish votes by strong assists from the rising power of the Democratic Socialist faction in the Democratic Party.
In the last two years, New York City alone has experienced the loss of two major pro-Israel, senior Democratic members of congress, Joe Crowley and Eliot Engel, in Democratic primaries. Both Crowley and Engel lost to insurgent Democratic Socialist upstarts - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Jamaal Bowman.
Bowman, who will waltz into Congress come January, will be starting off at the bottom of the Congressional totem pole. Bowman, of course, will not replace Engel on his perch as the chairman of the very powerful House Foreign Affairs Committee, where Engel has led vigorous investigations into Trump, been a strong and reliable voice against hate crimes and fighting antisemitism, championing a two-state solution, and having been recognized by organizations like the American Jewish Congress for promoting ties between the US and Israel among non Jews.
Engel lost to a candidate in Bowman who has created significant anxiety in the Jewish community. Indeed, in an open letter to Bowman, Rabbi Avi Weiss, the founding rabbi of the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale in the Bronx, cited a tweet sent by Bowman stating that Rep. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib ""do not hate Israel"". Weiss reminds us in his letter that Bowman went out of his way to defend these two members of congress, whose past statements have been condemned by the Anti-Defamation League, the Simon Wiesenthal Center and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Rabbi Weiss also noted in his letter that Bowman's Israel policy itself was ""too questionable"" to garner his support.
In full disclosure, we are non-unbiased observers, we were a part of Engel's team during his most recent loss and have worked on and off on his Congressional races for the last 20 years.
While the overall number of votes cast in the Crowley/AOC and Engel/Bowman races were very small, they are nevertheless changing the face of the national Democratic Party, moving it leftward ideologically, and putting its foreign policy positions somewhat at odds with the traditional policy platform of the Democratic Party.
The open question is whether Bowman's win - as well as the Democratic Socialist's rise in the Democratic Party - will further exacerbate the tensions between Democrats and Jewish voters.
And in the age of Trump, these two races are threatening to further fracture relations between the Democratic Party and the Jewish people.
It certainly didn't help matters that during the Democratic presidential campaign, the main Democratic contenders all blew off the opportunity to address the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee's conference in 2019 and only Mike Bloomberg had the courage to attend in 2020 in person. This would have been unthinkable even four years ago and is regrettable.
Some of those who powered AOC and Bowman to victory have suggested that Democrats must be far more forceful in our disagreements with the government of Israel - no longer blindly towing the line. But that argument misses the point. Indeed, according to polling by J Street, 80% of Jewish voters think that someone can indeed be critical of Israeli government policies and still be ""pro-Israel"" at the same time.
What Democrats must not forget is that whatever genuine policy disagreements that we may have with whatever government is in power in Israel, the country is a hugely important strategic ally in a volatile region of the world that we need to build even closer ties with. What Democrats need to argue for - loudly and unequivocally - is strong support for a two-state solution, strong commitment and determination to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Democrats need to be very careful not to inject words or phrases which can be construed as antisemitic or anti-Israeli into our rhetoric or social media channels. Words do indeed matter.

On Facebook, strangers snipe at each other. Old friends ""unfriend"" each other based on political preference. Talking heads trade insults on cable ""news.""
The angry acting out isn't new: Four years ago, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told an interviewer on public radio ""... hate has become the currency of this nation. We hate, therefore we are."" The facts bore him out: The FBI had just documented a 16-year peak in all types of hate crimes.
Which brings me to some of the ways people use prejudice and personal attack as forms of identity here in the West. In Idaho, where I've lived for over nine years, big diesel pickup trucks are a way of life - even for folks who live in Boise and probably don't need them for hauling.
Before the 2016 election, I began noticing more and more big pickups with full-sized American flags mounted in the rear cab. Soon after, many of those trucks had a full-sized Confederate flag mounted on the opposite side. I asked a man who works on diesel engines why he thought so many guys in big pickups were flying the Confederate flag, here in Idaho. After all, this was the West, not the South.
""They're just giving the finger to this fing politically correct government,"" he said.
If that were true, then American flags as protest to Obama should have stopped once Trump was elected. Instead, there were more flags than ever before the 2020 election. I've come to see the flag flying as a form of personal identity.
I asked an African-American friend how the flags made him feel. ""Intimidated and unwelcome,"" was his reply. But they intimidate me, too, and I'm white.
Others use their trucks as weapons of aggression. I drive a 15-year-old little red sporty Japanese car. Back when I lived in southern California, the sunroof was open almost every day. In Idaho, I still like to open my sunroof on nice days. Funny thing is, even though the air here is theoretically much cleaner than it is in Los Angeles, I nearly always end up having to close it. Perhaps because my little red car is definitely not an ""Idaho car.""
When somebody in a big diesel pickup equipped with ""rolling coal"" sees me, he inevitably speeds up, passes me and then steps on the brakes. As I near his tail, a giant cloud of toxic black diesel exhaust blows out, and if I haven't already shut my sunroof, I'm going to be inhaling it. What drives his aggression and gives him pleasure about harming me?
In 2017, Idaho State Sen. Michelle Stennett, D-Ketchum, introduced a bill to prohibit the practice of modifying diesel engines to increase the amount of soot and smoke belching from tailpipes. The bill failed to pass, but thanks to the Clean Air Act, rolling coal is already illegal. In Idaho, however, don't expect much enforcement.
Unless there's a state law, most Idaho police won't issue tickets for rolling-coal pollution violations. The bill would have made it a misdemeanor, but the state Senate decided that public health was less important than the right of angry drivers in diesel trucks to blow smoke into our faces.
I've also heard from bicycle riders who say they're sitting ducks when trucks pass by while belching out black smoke, and that this is a particular problem on rural roads.
It seems to me there was a time - not that long ago - when this would have been considered rude, if not downright dangerous.
The people who spew hate on the internet or peddle conspiracy theories on Facebook, who wave flags all over town or who blow smoke in our faces all say they are expressing the freedom to be themselves. They are proud to be ""politically incorrect.
Last week at my local gym, a man strode angrily up to the front desk to complain about the rap music playing that day. ""Turn off that f#%in' music and put on some rock 'n roll!"" he insisted. The staffer at the front desk was Black. After a moment of deer-in-the-headlights shock, he quickly complied.
You know what politically correct means? It means nothing more than good manners, and manners are sorely lacking these days."

In fact, over the years we have represented a number of individuals who are significant donors to the Anti-Defamation League, the latest organization working together with Sharpton. Civil rights issues in the African American community are indeed serious; and they should be taken seriously by leaders of the Jewish community. 
Indeed, it is important for there to be a united front among those in other minority communities in calling out racism in any way it may manifest itself. It's incumbent upon us as Jews to call out racism - and I've been personally heartened by the participation of members of the Jewish community in some of the peaceful demonstrations that have taken place.But that does not and should not ever take place at the expense of promoting anti-Semites or bigots of any stripe. Indeed we are doing a disservice to the African American community by propping up someone like Al Sharpton by doing so. There are many decent and impressive civil rights activists within the African American community who deserve our support, and certainly deserve a platform. Al Sharpton is not one of them.For those that don't know, Al Sharpton has a long and storied history of Jew hatred, that has been well documented over the years. Sharpton played a central role in provoking the rioters in Crown Heights back in the summer of 1991. Riots that led to the death of Yankel Rosenbaum. ""If the Jews want to get it on, tell them to pin their Yarmulkas back and come over...,"" said Sharpton, during that three day stretch of riots.Sharpton never properly offered genuine remorse for this sort of rhetoric. And his actual participation and fomenting of violence in the form of these riots is something that the Jewish community can never forget. Sharpton's list of anti-Jewish screeds go well beyond the rhetoric he employed during those riots. Sharpton has referred to Jews in the past as ""diamond merchants,"" ""white interlopers,"" and ""Jew bastards.""It is not therefore unreasonable to ask why the ADL and Jonathan Greenblatt are proudly collaborating with Sharpton in the #StopHateforProfit campaign. This isn't about the merits of the campaign. It's about a figure who no Jewish lay leader ought to be working with when it comes to issues of civil rights. It's not only a disservice to the Jewish community; but a slap in the face to the African American community as well. The African American community deserves better.U.S. Deputy Anti-Semitism Envoy: Anti-Zionism Is Anti-Semitism[2] The ""coronavirus conspiracy theory [is] a modern-day blood libel, where Jews or the State of Israel is blamed for the pandemic,"" U.S. deputy anti-Semitism envoy Ellie Cohanim told Jewish leaders on Monday. ""It is not being spread by the usual bad actors on the dark web or elsewhere, but by government officials spreading the lies - from Turkey, the Palestinian Authority and Iran.""Cohanim, who fled Iran with her family during the 1979 revolution, said she had learned two lessons from her family's experience: that even societies welcoming or hospitable to Jews, like Iran was under the Shah, ""can suddenly flip overnight""; and that Jews can ""never underestimate the threat of anti-Semitism.""Asked about the possibility that extension of sovereignty by Israel to parts of the West Bank may lead to increases in anti-Semitism, she said, ""Just the fact that American Jewry is nervous about this shows that we have been conditioned to feel the anti-Semitism in our bones."" She noted that no other country is subjected to the same kind of scrutiny when they make decisions for their populace.Asked about the notion that one can be anti-Zionist and not anti-Semitic, Cohanim said U.S. policy is that ""anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism. Full stop."" She added that when people criticize other countries for action they have taken, that doesn't lead to a discussion about the country's right to exist.

Among the latter is the Basic Law: Israel as the Nation State of the Jewish People.But it is Ohana's view of judiciary overreach that has earned him the greatest wrath among his detractors. When he was first appointed justice minister, he made a statement to the effect that not all Supreme Court decisions should be honored.In the wake of the ensuing uproar from the disingenuous ""defenders of democracy""- those who don't believe in the separation of powers as long as the judges that they deem politically correct are occupying the bench -Channel 12's Amit Segal asked Ohana if he really meant what he had said.""Yes,"" Ohana answered, quipping, ""the 'supreme' consideration must be to safeguard the lives of [Israeli] citizens.""Nor did Ohana falter when Segal challenged him to contradict himself in relation to the Supreme Court's liberalism towards gays is concerned. Ohana - who lives in Tel Aviv with his partner, Alon Hadad, and their two children - smiled and shook his head.The most important strides in LGBTQ rights, he replied, were made in the Knesset - the legislative body, not in the courts. The point he was trying to drive home is that the business of enacting laws is the job of elected parliamentarians, not judges appointed by committees comprising their cronies.https://www.drybonesproject.com/blog/D20702_1.png; 'Intrinsically tied to Black Lives Matter': Harvard student leads anti-Israel march on Capitol[6] Protesters on Wednesday marched from the Lincoln Memorial to the Capitol building in a demonstration intended to tie the cause of Black Lives Matter to the Boycott, Sanctions, and Divestment movement against Israel.The march, led by Harvard University rising senior Christian Tabash, attracted about 200 people who carried signs with messages either supporting the Palestinian Liberation Organization or Black Lives Matter. The event, although independently organized, was held in tandem with a series of ""Day of Rage"" demonstrations against Israel's territorial claims on the West Bank.As the march progressed, Tabash led his followers in alternating chants about Israel and racial justice.""Israel, we know you, you murder children, too,"" the crowd chanted at one point.The crowd immediately followed that chant with alternating rallying cries of ""Black lives matter!"" and ""Palestinian lives matter!"" Many more shouted criticisms of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. A woman waved a sign that on one side bore the Palestinian flag and, on the other, the phrase ""Black Lives Matter.""Tabash also led the group in the reading of poetry detailing the crimes of Israel against Palestinian Muslims. One poem entitled ""Mr. War"" decried the Israeli government: ""Curse thee, the corrupters of Zion. F--- this occupation!"" The poem later referred to the Jewish state as the ""puppet master of continents,"" a reference to a centuries-old conspiracy that Jewish people secretly rule the world.

By affirming the district court's order to release the defendants on the conditions imposed, we do not seek to minimize the severity of the offense. Rather, we recognize the constraints on our appellate review and the fact that the gravity of an offense is not the only factor to be considered by the district court in deciding whether the conditions of release are adequate to ensure the defendants will not flee and do not constitute a continuing threat to the community. *** Judge Jon Newman wrote in Dissent: On the night of May 29 in Brooklyn, Appellee Urooj Rahman got out of a car driven by Appellee Colinford Mattis, lit an explosive device known as a Molotov cocktail, and tossed it through the broken window of an unoccupied police car, setting the console on fire. Parked where people were nearby, she attempted to distribute bombs to a bystander and others for their use. She then left the scene in Mattis's car, which contained one completed bomb and components for making more bombs. Their thinking was expressed by Rahman on a videotape, about an hour before the crime: 'The only way they hear us is through violence.' The majority's decision to affirm the release of these Appellees from pretrial detention subjects the community to an unacceptable risk of danger. I respectfully dissent.

Late Wednesday, the Knesset reinstated the Shin Bet agency's surveillance program to track virus carriers, effective over the next three weeks.According to Channel 12, during Thursday's meeting, health officials will implore ministers to limit the number of patrons permitted to enter a bar, restaurant or event hall to 50. Health officials are also seeking to cap the number of worshipers at prayer gatherings to 20, the TV report said.The ministry said Thursday there have been 26,452 cases since the start of the pandemic, of which 8,647 were active; 17,481 people have recovered. That marked an increase of over 6,000 new COVID-19 cases over the month of June.Fifty-eight people are in serious condition, 24 of them on ventilators, while 71 more are in moderate condition. The rest are displaying mild or no symptoms.The ministry said 20,798 tests were conducted on Wednesday, of which 4.6 percent had a positive result. Gantz approves call-up of 500 reservists to help battle resurgent coronavirus[16] Defense Minister Benny Gantz on Thursday approved the call-up of 500 IDF reservists to help combat the renewed spread of the coronavirus pandemic, which many in Israel believe has entered a second wave.The decision was made in light of fresh assessments about the pandemic. Most of the troops will be used as staff at 10 coronavirus hotels the Defense Ministry plans to reopen to house people with light symptoms or who require preventive quarantine, Gantz's office said in a statement.The IDF Home Front Command was also instructed to set up headquarters in a number of Israeli cities and towns to help distribute information to residents and to safely move coronavirus patients to hospitals and hotels.The Health Ministry on Thursday morning recorded 905 new coronavirus infections over 24 hours and two more deaths since Wednesday evening, bringing the national toll from the pandemic to 324.The ministry said Thursday there have been 26,452 cases since the start of the pandemic, of which 8,647 are active, while 17,481 people have recovered. The month of June saw over 6,000 new COVID-19 cases.The new figures came after a lockdown was imposed on parts of Ashdod and Lod early Thursday to contain the spread of the virus, and ministers were set to meet again to discuss further restrictions to rein in the alarming rise in infections. Late Wednesday, the Knesset reinstated the Shin Bet agency's surveillance program to track virus carriers, effective over the next three weeks. Israeli researchers say they've developed more efficient, accurate antibody test[17] Israeli researchers have developed a highly accurate and efficient test for coronavirus antibodies that could greatly contribute to ongoing efforts to assess the extent of the virus spread among the population, Channel 13 news reported Wednesday.Antibody tests are seen as a key component in finding out who already had the disease in order to better understand its spread and shape policy ahead of a possible second outbreak.Professors Ariel Munitz and Mordechay Gerlic of Tel Aviv University say the serological test they have produced can, from one blood sample, identify all three of the key antibodies that counter the virus.It is apparently the first time that anyone has produced a single serological test that can spot all three of the antibodies, the report said.The test is very sensitive and accurate to around 98-99 percent, the researchers claim, better than the current method being used in the country, which is rated at between 95% and 98%.During the course of research carried out in cooperation with Hasharon Hospital in Petah Tikva, the team also noticed a trend showing that patients who became seriously ill from the virus developed antibodies more rapidly at an early stage of their infection than did those who had light symptoms.'We understand this as apparently the result of, in fact, a higher activation of the immune system,' Munitz said. Plaid Cymru launches investigation after Senedd candidate accused of antisemitism[18] Plaid Cymru has launched an investigation after a leading Jewish organisation accused one of their candidates of antisemisitm.Senior vice president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, Sheila Gewolb, has called for prominent Plaid Cymru candidate Sahar Al-Faifi to be excluded from the party permanently following a tweet which appeared on her account and has since been deleted.In a post on Twitter Ms Al-Faifi wrote: 'If you wonder where did these American cops trained, look no further than Israel. Oppression is one and the struggle is transitional. We stand with Palestinians and with #GeorgeFloyd #BlackLivesMatter.""She has subsequently deleted posts she made on social media.In a letter to Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price, Sheila Gewolb wrote: 'Some US police officers have received anti-terror training in Israel, as they have from many different countries - law enforcement agencies across the world co-operate with each other.'There is not now, nor has there ever been, any evidence to suggest that Israel instructed US police officers in the techniques they have used against African Americans or that any of the officers involved in such attacks received Israeli training.'The attempt to blame Israel for terrible situations in other countries is regarded by many in the Jewish community as antisemitic, stemming as it does from a long and ignominious history of blaming Jews for any and all misfortunes.'She added: 'We would urge you, as the leader of Plaid Cymru, to show that you are serious about antisemitism and Ms Al-Faifi in particular by permanently excluding her from the Party. She has had too many chances already and it is clear that she will not change. By allowing her to again get away with it, Plaid Cymru would be sending a very negative message to the UK's Jewish community.'Sahar Al-Faifi had previously been suspended from the Party after a number of antisemitic social media posts of hers from 2014 were found. However, she was later reinstated. We've just been informed that @johnmcdonnellMP[19] didn't delete this tweet by Holocaust denier Sarah Wilkinson from his TL. It's still there and he now is knowingly promoting a Holocaust denier.

These pages, presumably created by Syracuse University students, invited students and faculty to post about incidents of discrimination and bias on campus to unite the student body against hatred.Unfortunately, several posts from these profiles inspired the exact opposite.A June 19 post on the @BIPOC.Syracuse page stated 'There are professors at SU who are openly Zionist to the point that it hurts Palestinian studentsThis shit runs deep.' This set off an anti-Semitic witch hunt targeting Miriam Elman, a Jewish faculty member at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs who was also mentioned in a @BlackatCuse post on June 20.Despite being on leave for the past year, Elman was singled out by a malicious and libelous smear campaign for her support of Jewish self-determination and prior service in the Israeli Defense Forces.The heinous anti-Semitic insults directed at Elman send a clear message: shed your Zionist identity or get canceled. It reeks of pure McCarthyism.Inexplicably, while the university administration has engaged in public relations calisthenics for months to show its sensitivity to campus discrimination, their silence regarding this particular issue is deafening.North Jersey Paper Aims at Israel — and Misses[24] 'Get your facts first,' Mark Twain once intoned, 'and then you can distort them as you please.' Yet, when it comes to the Israel-Islamist conflict, the North Jersey Record isn't even bothering with facts. The newspaper's recent report, '#8216;We need to pursue systemic change': Palestinian Americans in NJ brace for annexation,' offers a masterclass in both distortions and omissions.Indeed, the report is so problematic and biased that it's hard to know where to begin.NJ Record correspondent Hannan Adely reported that on June 28, 'about 200 people gathered outside Paterson City Hall' in New Jersey where they raised the Palestinian flag and protested 'Israel's plan to annex large swaths of the West Bank starting Wednesday, July 1 — a move they said would suffocate Palestinians and scuttle any remaining chance for peace.''Annexation,' the NJ Record claims, 'happens when a country declares that land outside its borders is part of its own state.' The plan 'would leave Palestinians with 15% of their historic homeland' and 'allow Israel to encircle all Palestinian land and cut it off from the border with Jordan.'Nearly every word in this paragraph is inaccurate. As international law scholar Eugene Kontorovich has noted: 'Annexation in international law specifically means taking the territory of a foreign sovereign country.' And neither the Jordan Valley nor the West Bank (Judea and Samaria) belongs to a 'foreign sovereign country.'BBC 'Focus on Africa' interviewer uses 'white Jews' stereotype[25] While Israeli citizens of Ethiopian origin may well suffer from racism or discrimination, they do of course have exactly the same rights as citizens of any other origin and to suggest that they do not materially misleads BBC audiences.No less inaccurate and misleading is Okwoche's reference to 'white Jews'. The majority of Jews living in Israel are of Mizrahi or Sephardi origin or descent - i.e. they or their families came from Middle Eastern countries such as Yemen or Iraq or North African countries such as Morocco, Libya and Algeria. But not only is Okwoche's suggestion that Israeli Jews who are not of Ethiopian descent are 'white' inaccurate: the use of the term 'white Jews' is in itself problematic because it negates Jewish history.One would of course expect the BBC to avoid such tone-deaf stereotypes - particularly in an item supposedly about 'a common struggle against racism'.BBC orders presenters not to wear Black Lives Matter badges on air after CAA confronts antisemitism in the movement and other extreme views emerge[26] The BBC has reportedly ordered its television presenters not to wear Black Lives Matter (BLM) badges on air after Campaign Against Antisemitism exposed worrying antisemitism in the movement and its other extreme views emerged.Executives at the public broadcaster declared that 'visual symbols of support' for BLM should not be worn on screen after leaders within BLM hijacked the killing of George Floyd to spread antisemitism and to promote an extreme agenda. 'The BBC cannot be seen to support any kind of cause over another, and Black Lives Matter is certainly a campaign,' the BBC ruled.The decision was part of a wider backlash against the BLM movement after Campaign Against Antisemitism called out antisemitic tweets over the weekend. Police forces and several celebrities have distanced themselves from the movement, as has the Premier League.Among the first football clubs to break with BLM were Tottenham Hotspur, which said that 'it is unacceptable that a value-based action is being hijacked by those with their own political agenda,' and Crystal Palace, which announced: 'We would like to make clear that we do not endorse any pressure group or body that carries the same term in its name, and we strongly believe that organisations should not use this important force for change and positivity to push their own political agendas. We want to be part of a world that is fair, inclusive and open to all.' Palestinian city of Hebron !?!? Hello @YishaiFleisher[27] @epieprz[28] ... https://t.co /cC4aW9cySp[29] — Arsen Ostrovsky (@Ostrov_A) July 2, 2020[30] PreOccupiedTerritory: Newsroom Scare: Religion Reporter Almost Gets Something Right (satire)[31] Editorial and reporting staff at Haaretz breathed a sigh of relief Wednesday upon discovering that an article on Orthodox Jews did not, as feared, let facts go unvarnished by the bias, disdain, and arrogance of the secular journalists involved.Israel 's 'paper of record' dodged a journalistic bullet, editors reported this morning, following indications that an article covering the Jerusalem Rabbinate's refusal to continue certifying a certain restaurant as kosher failed to disguise the writer's dismissal of religious sensibilities, his presumption, and his axiomatic view of adherence to Jewish tradition as Neanderthal. In fact the writer did manage to convey a mangled, immature understanding of the religious precepts involved, and did succeed in painting those who take care to follow those precepts as barbaric, sheep-like reactionaries.'That was a close one,' breathed publisher Amos Schocken. 'I was this close to ordering a thorough review of our editorial process, but it turns out our reporters followed proper procedure and included all the necessary anti-religious - which is to say, anti-Jewish - elements to meet our exacting standards. I still might conduct a different review, though, to determine how we came under the wrong impression.'Editors, reporters, and columnists expressed their sense of making a narrow escape from potentially unpleasant circumstances. 'I'm trying not to think about what would have happened if anyone left an article about Jewish observance go without at least negative or condescending subtext,' admitted entertainment critic Rogel Alpher. 'The public, especially our readers of the English-language edition, have come to expect from us a certain detached, which is to say animosity-laden, attitude toward anything that respects Jewish heritage, Jewish practice, or Jewish attachment to the ancestral Jewish homeland. Letting even a paragraph slip by without continuing to hammer this ethos home might convey the mistaken notion that our assumptions have shifted, but in that respect we remain, well, conservative.'#8216;Middle-Class' and 'Everyday': New Survey Exposes Alarming Nature of Antisemitism in Switzerland[32] Antisemitic behavior toward Jews is alarmingly common in Switzerland, a new academic study of victim experiences published on Thursday revealed.The report — conducted by the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW) — surveyed 500 Swiss Jews about their experiences of antisemitism, discovering that 50 percent of the respondents had been personally targeted for antisemitic abuse during the last five years.About 18,000 Jews live in Switzerland.The survey's director, Prof. Dirk Baier, told the Berner Oberlander newspaper that he was not surprised by the results, pointing to a recent Swiss government survey showing that one in ten citizens held negative views of Jews.He pointed out that similar animosity existed toward other minorities.'If you asked 500 black people in Switzerland about their experiences, you'd probably get responses similar to those of the Jewish community now,' Baier commented.Antisemitic Acts in California Rose 12% in 2019 Amid Overall Hate Crime Decline, Official Statistics Show[33] Hate crimes targeting Jews rose sharply in California in 2019 despite an overall decline in hate crimes in the state, according to a report released on Thursday by the state's Criminal Justice Statistics Center.Antisemitic crimes — including the deadly gun attack on a Passover service on a Chabad synagogue in Poway — increased by 12 percent in 2019, the report said.The one person to have been murdered in a hate crime was Lori Gilbert-Kaye, a 60-year-old woman who was in attendance at the Poway synagogue on April 27, the last day of the Passover holiday.Three other worshipers, including the community's rabbi and an 8-year-old girl, were wounded in the attack carried out by John Earnest, a white supremacist.The rise in antisemitic acts came as overall hate crime declined in California by nearly 5 percent, the report noted. A total of 141 antisemitic incidents were recorded in 2019.California state law defines hate crimes as those targeting victims because of their race or ethnicity, nationality, religion, sexual orientation, gender or a disability.German politicians part of 'Anti-Israel International,' says expert[34] Henryk Broder, Germany's leading authority on contemporary antisemitism in the federal republic, wrote on Monday that scores of left-wing German politicians are anti-Israel because they signed a letter slamming Israel's plan to exercise sovereignty over parts of the disputed West Bank territory.Broder, who has testified in the Bundestag about new forms of Jew-hatred since the Holocaust, titled his article 'The anti-Israel International' on the popular journalist website 'The Axis of Good.'The German Jewish author and journalist writes commentary for the Die Welt -a large broadsheet paper. Broder has a significant readership in the German-speaking world.He mocked German politicians from the Left, Social Democratic and Green parties who signed the protest letter for not directing their letter to Turkey's occupation of North Cyprus, Russia's annexation of Crimea and China's occupation of Tibet.Critics have cited the European political preoccupation with the Jewish state as a form of double standard. Israel's democracy is singled out while non-democratic nations who commit massive human rights crimes are not targeted.Montreal unlikely to change metro station named after antisemite[35] Amid the push to remove statues and symbols with historical ties to racist concepts and ideas in the United States, Canada and Western Europe, the city of Montreal has faced growing criticism to remove the name of Lionel Groulx (1878-1967), a French Canadian Roman Catholic priest, historian and Quebec nationalist who harbored strong antisemitic views, according to a CBC news report early last week. Revered by ardent Quebec nationalists and separatists, controversy surrounding Groulx's antisemitic opinions first arose in 1990, in what became known as the Delisle-Richler affair, when famed Jewish-Canadian author Mordecai Richler and French-Canadian historian Esther Delisle accused several pre-World War II Quebec intellectuals, including Groulx, of virulent antisemitism and sympathies for Vichy France. Richler and Delisle claimed that in 1933 Groulx, at the height of support for Fascism in Quebec, wrote under the pseudonym Jacques Brassier an article entitled ""So That We May Live..."", which was published in the journal L'Action nationale [National Action], and encouraged Quebeckers, especially French-speaking Quebeckers, to boycott Jewish businesses in the city as a means for dispelling the ""Jewish problem.""A century on, Finland air force drops swastika symbol[36] Finland's Air Force Command has quietly phased out its swastika emblem after over a century, a researcher said Wednesday.Though Finland was allied with the Nazis against the Soviet Union during World War II, and though the Swedish count who introduced the symbol to the country in 1918 would become the brother-in-law of a prominent SS leader and friend to Adolf Hitler, the symbol's use in the country preceded Nazism by several years and defenders say it has no links to the fascist movement.University of Helsinki academic Teivo Teivainen noted the policy change in an interview with the BBC.With Finland's founding in 1918, Count Eric von Rosen of neighboring Sweden gifted the Finnish air force with a plane emblazoned with a blue swastika, which he saw as a good luck charm, according to the report.The Nazi Party officially adopted the swastika two years later, in 1920.In tribute to von Rosen, the emblem continued to be used on Finland's Air Force planes through 1945.Following World War II, the swastika was scrubbed from the planes but continued to appear on Air Force uniforms and other military items, such as flags. Israel-founded online insurer Lemonade raises $319 million in New York IPO[37] New York-based online insurer Lemonade Inc., founded by Israeli entrepreneurs Shai Wininger and Daniel Schreiber, has raised $319 million on the New York Stock Exchange in an initial public offering of shares, at a market valuation of $1.6 billion.The company sold 11 million shares at $29 per share. The market valuation of the IPO is less than the $2.1 billion the firm was valued at last year, after it raised $300 million in a private funding round led by Japan's SoftBank, which owns a 27.3% stake in Lemonade, Reuters said on Thursday.The firm's shares will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol LMND.The firm, founded in 2015, is a licensed insurer in 40 US states and operates in 28 of those states, including California, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, and Texas. Lemonade also holds a pan-European license, a prospectus filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission in June said.The company says it seeks to revolutionize the way homes are insured. Its technology does away with agents and replaces them with artificial intelligence and bots, applications that perform an automated task. Israeli researchers develop tomato strain for inhibiting degenerative diseases [38] Israeli researchers have developed a new tomato strain that can fight severe degenerative diseases, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (HU) said Thursday.This new cultivar is rich in a substance called zeaxanthin, which may inhibit many degenerative diseases through the protection of light receptors in the retina from damage caused by strong blue light.Zeaxanthin is a natural yellow coloring matter (pigment) that helps plants in the photosynthesis process and can be found mainly in corn, orange peppers, pumpkins and citrus fruits, and at very low concentrations in melons, mangos, apricots and peaches.The researchers said adding zeaxanthin to the daily diet helps to reduce the morbidity of degenerative diseases, especially macular degeneration (AMD) that causes blindness in adults.The development of the new tomato was done by classical genetic cultivation, using hybridizations of different strains, resulting in a new tomato strain whose zeaxanthin make up more than half of the pigments in it.This is added to vitamins and other essential ingredients found in regular tomatoes.The new tomato has seven times more zeaxanthin than corn, which is the main source of this substance in today's diets. (h/t Zvi)Israeli invents self-healing artificial electronic skin[39] A doctoral student at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa has invented a soft polymer that could be used as a self-healing high-tech 'skin.'Muhammad Khatib's polymer is elastic and waterproof. It can heal itself if scratched, cut or twisted, or in the event of a disruption to its electrical conductivity and chemical sensing capabilities.This 'e-skin' could be used in a range of applications in the fields of robotics, prosthetics and wearable devices.Khatib, who conducts his research at the Wolfson Faculty of Chemical Engineering at the Technion under the guidance of Prof. Hossam Haick, presented his innovative inventions in two papers in the journals Advanced Materials and Advanced Functional Materials.

Today is Monday, Aug. 3, the 216th day of 2020. There are 150 days left in the year.
Today’s Highlight in History:
On August 3, 1993, the Senate voted 96-to-three to confirm Supreme Court nominee Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
On this date:
In 1807, former Vice President Aaron Burr went on trial before a federal court in Richmond, Virginia, charged with treason. (He was acquitted less than a month later.)
In 1811, Elisha Otis, founder of the elevator company that still bears his name, was born in Halifax, Vt.
In 1863, the first thoroughbred horse races took place at the Saratoga Race Course in Saratoga Springs, New York.
In 1921, baseball commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis refused to reinstate the former Chicago White Sox players implicated in the “Black Sox” scandal, despite their acquittals in a jury trial.
In 1936, Jesse Owens of the United States won the first of his four gold medals at the Berlin Olympics as he took the 100-meter sprint.
In 1949, the National Basketball Association was formed as a merger of the Basketball Association of America and the National Basketball League.
In 1958, the nuclear-powered submarine USS Nautilus became the first vessel to cross the North Pole underwater.
In 1972, the U.S. Senate ratified the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union. (The U.S. unilaterally withdrew from the treaty in 2002.)
In 1981, U.S. air traffic controllers went on strike, despite a warning from President Ronald Reagan they would be fired, which they were.
In 1994, Arkansas carried out the nation’s first triple execution in 32 years. Stephen G. Breyer was sworn in as the Supreme Court’s newest justice in a private ceremony at Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist’s Vermont summer home.
In 2014, Israel withdrew most of its ground troops from the Gaza Strip in an apparent winding down of a nearly monthlong operation against Hamas that had left more than 1,800 Palestinians and more than 60 Israelis dead.
In 2018, Las Vegas police said they were closing their investigation into the Oct. 1 shooting that left 58 people dead at a country music festival without a definitive answer for why Stephen Paddock unleashed gunfire from a hotel suite onto the concert crowd.
Ten years ago: Engineers began pumping heavy drilling mud into the blown-out Gulf of Mexico oil well in an attempt to permanently plug the leak. A warehouse driver killed eight co-workers and himself in a shooting rampage at a Manchester, Connecticut, beer distributorship.
Five years ago: Seeking to clamp down on power plant emissions, President Barack Obama unveiled a federal plan that would attempt to slow global warming by dramatically shifting the way Americans get and use electricity; opponents denounced the proposal as an egregious federal overreach that would send power prices surging, and vowed lawsuits and legislation to try to stop it.
One year ago: A gunman opened fire at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, leaving 22 people dead; prosecutors said Patrick Crusius targeted Mexicans in hopes of scaring Latinos into leaving the U.S., and that he had outlined the plot in a screed published online shortly before the attack. (Crusius has pleaded not guilty to state murder charges; he also faces federal hate crime and gun charges.)

Jones Day partners Shirlethia Franklin, Yaakov Roth, and Sparkle Sooknanan were named 'D.C Rising Stars' for 2020 by the National Law Journal (NLJ). The Rising Star awards recognize the 40 most promising lawyers age 40 and younger in the Washington, D.C area who have become influential in their areas of practice.
Ms. Franklin, a partner in the Firm's Business & Tort Litigation Practice, litigates complex civil cases and handles disputes and investigations involving the federal government. She joined Jones Day as of counsel in 2017 after serving in the Obama Administration, first as recipient of a White House Fellowship, one of the nation’s most prestigious fellowships for leadership and public service, and then as a high-ranking counselor to two successive Attorneys General: Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch. After joining the Firm, she became partner in just two years. The NLJ noted that Ms. Franklin led the team, and served as first-chair trial lawyer, on an important matter representing four Charlottesville City Councilors who voted to relocate the Robert E. Lee and Thomas J. Jackson statues at the center of the violent rally in Charlottesville in August 2017. The Firm's victory on behalf of the City Councilors thwarted efforts to hold them personally liable, getting them dismissed from the suit and saving them from a maximum damages award of more than $1.3 million (plus three percent of their salaries). Ms. Franklin has demonstrated leadership both in and outside the courtroom. She is a leader of Jones Day's Constitutional Policing and Civil Justice Reform Task Force and the Firm's Hate Crimes Task Force. She is also the driving force behind the establishment of the Firm's Black Lawyers Group, which supports the Firm's larger diversity efforts by helping to attract, retain, and promote Black lawyers, and has contributed to a 30 percent increase in Black lawyers at the Firm in a two-year period.
Mr. Roth, a partner in the Firm's Issues & Appeals practice, has played a leading role in many of Jones Day's most high-profile Supreme Court matters, and has grown into a leader in his practice and the broader appellate community. Originally from Toronto, Mr. Roth left Canada to attend Harvard Law School. He clerked first for the Chief Judge of the U.S Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Boston, then for Justice Antonin Scalia of the U.S Supreme Court. Mr. Roth is one of very few noncitizens to have served as a Supreme Court clerk. He joined Jones Day as an associate in 2009 and was invited to join the partnership effective January 1, 2017. The following December, he was elected to join the American Law Institute. While an appellate generalist, Mr. Roth has distinguished himself in a number of niche areas, including ERISA and white collar crime. This year, in his first appearance as an oralist before the Supreme Court, he won a sweeping, unanimous victory on behalf of client Bridget Kelly, whose convictions for federal property fraud inthe Bridgegate case were reversed by the Court adopting precisely the arguments Mr. Roth advanced. Kelly will become a seminal precedent on the scope of the federal fraud statutes.
Ms. Sooknanan, a partner in the Issues & Appeals Practice, has been at the center of a number of the Firm's important engagements. Born in Trinidad and Tobago, she left home at 16 to attend college, and later business school, in New York, then earned her law degree at Brooklyn Law School at night while working full time. Upon graduation, she began four years of government service, including a year in the Civil Appellate Division at the Department of Justice, and clerkships with Judge Eric Vitaliano, Judge Guido Calabresi, and Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Ms. Sooknanan joined Jones Day in 2014 and became a partner in January of this year. One of her significant representations was leading the team representing a group of investors in bonds issued by Puerto Rico's pension system. Ms. Sooknanan spearheaded a unique litigation plan, including filing a constitutional 'takings' claim to recover more than $1 billion from the United States for the confiscation of property. When the government sought dismissal, she presented oral argument and won a key jurisdictional ruling. Since then, other creditors have filed almost identical lawsuits. Ms. Sooknanan also played a significant role in the Firm's representation of the Charlottesville City Councilors, including helping to craft novel constitutional arguments that the Lee and Jackson statues violate the Equal Protection Clause. Those arguments received widespread notice in legal and academic commentary and have served as a model for parties in similar litigation."

237,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_1001/Files (250).DOCX","Impact News Service",2020-12-23,"939 words",NA,NA,NA,"Nicaragua: Law Threatens Free, Fair Elections",FALSE,"New York: Human Rights Watch has issued the following press release:
The Nicaraguan Congress passed a law proposed by President Daniel Ortega on December 21, 2020 that appears designed to bar opposition candidates from participating in the 2021 presidential elections, Human Rights Watch said today. Member states of the Organization of American States (OAS) and the European Union (EU) should urgently condemn this legislation that threatens Nicaraguans’ rights to run for office and vote in fair and free elections.
The law prohibits so-called “traitors” from running for or holding public office. It defines “traitors” in sweeping terms to include, for example, people who “undermine independence, sovereignty and self-determination” or “damage the supreme interests of the nation. ” The law is silent on how such a determination would be made, or by whom.
“Doing Ortega’s bidding, the Nicaraguan Congress has passed a law that could be used to label Ortega’s opponents as ‘traitors’ and keep them from running in the upcoming 2021 national elections,” said José Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at Human Rights Watch. “With this law in force, there is little to no hope of free and fair elections in Nicaragua. ”
President Ortega, who has been in power since 2007, sent the bill to Congress for its “urgent” consideration on December 18. The bill was passed with small modifications after a single debate and entered into force on December 22.
Under the law, a “traitor” is anyone deemed to “lead or finance a coup, alter the constitutional order, promote or incite terrorist acts, carry out acts that undermine independence, sovereignty, and self-determination, incite foreign interference in internal affairs, request military interventions, organize with foreign funding to carry out acts of terrorism and destabilization, propose and organize economic, commercial and financial blockades against the country and its institutions, those who demand, praise and applaud the imposition of sanctions against Nicaragua and its citizens, and all those who damage the supreme interests of the nation recognized in its legal system. ”
This law is inconsistent with regional and international human rights law, Human Rights Watch said.
The American Convention on Human Rights, which Nicaragua has ratified, provides in Article 23 that a law may regulate political rights, including the right “to vote and be elected in genuine periodic elections … only on the basis of age, nationality, residence, language, education, civil and mental capacity, or sentencing by a competent court in criminal proceedings. ”
The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Nicaragua is also a party, also recognizes and protects in Article 25 the right of every citizen, “without unreasonable restrictions,” to “take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives; to vote and be elected;” as well as to “have access, on general terms of equality, to public service in his country. ” The Human Rights Committee, which monitors countries’ compliance with the ICCPR, has said that any restrictions on the right to run or hold public office should be based on “objective and reasonable criteria. ”
In recent months, the Nicaraguan government has promoted, and Congress has passed, several other laws that seriously restrict rights to freedom of expression and association in the country and could undermine free and fair elections in 2021, Human Rights Watch said.
In October, Congress passed a “foreign agents” law, which requires many people and groups that receive direct or indirect funding from abroad to register as “foreign agents,” and bars them from intervening in “matters of internal politics. ” The law also forbids the individuals registered as “foreign agents” from running for public office until a year after they have withdrawn their registration and the government has verified that they are not receiving foreign funding.
That same month, Congress adopted a “cybercrime” law criminalizing a wide range of online communications. It provides prison sentences of up to four years for the “publication” or “dissemination” of “false” or “distorted” information on the internet “likely to spread anxiety, anguish or fear. ”
In November, Congress approved in its first reading a constitutional amendment that would allow life sentences for broadly defined “hate crimes. ” Nicaraguan law does not address “hate crimes,” although the government has often accused critics and political opponents of committing them. Congress is expected to pass the amendment in January 2021.
In 2018, a brutal crackdown on protesters by Nicaragua’s National Police and armed pro-government groups left over 300 people dead and 2,000 injured and resulted in hundreds of arbitrary arrests and prosecutions. The government stripped 10 nongovernmental organizations of their legal registration, forcing them to close, and harassed and detained journalists.
“By establishing an uneven playing field for the 2021 elections, the government is undermining the rights of all Nicaraguans to take part in free and fair elections,” Vivanco said. “And after 13 consecutive years as president, Ortega seems determined to stay in power even at the cost of Nicaraguans’ basic rights. ”
Correction: The news release was updated to reflect that, “The bill was passed with small modifications after a single debate and entered into force on December 22,” where it previously noted that, “The bill was passed with small modifications after a single debate and will became law as soon as it is published in the Official Gazette. ”"

Illiberalism is getting dangerous",FALSE,"Nothing has been more depressing about the so-called 'cancel culture' - where a group of people, often using social media, demand the excision of a public figure from his or her place in public life - than the speed with which one or two prominent newspapers have jumped on the bandwagon.
Newspapers and their websites are a crucial part of the vanguard in the battle to preserve free speech, and free speech by its very nature is often unpleasant to many who hear it.
This was not least why so many newspapers, nearly a decade ago, fought so hard against the plans by the Leveson inquiry to make what they printed subject, in the end, to government approval. Newspapers often print things governments dislike, and they dislike them usually because they are true. They have a vital part to play in upholding democracy.
But at the New York Times last month James Bennett, the editorial page editor, was sacked because he dared publish a piece by a Republican senator justifying the use of force in putting down the riots occasioned by the killing of George Floyd. It was not so much that the piece contradicted the line of the paper, as that it contradicted the line of Twitter, where the main mob deployed by the cancel culture is mobilised.
Then, earlier this week, Bari Weiss, a prominent New York Times columnist resigned very publicly from the paper, claiming it was being edited not by its notional editor, but by Twitter. The paper has long been known for its liberal sensitivities, but the sacking of Mr Bennett was a lurch into illiberalism that has shocked many of its devotees.
Now a British newspaper equally renowned for its liberal agenda, the Guardian, has announced it is not renewing the contract of Steve Bell, its cartoonist of almost 40 years' standing. He has been accused of using anti-semitic tropes and of engaging in racism towards other minorities, notably in a depictions of Priti Patel, the Home Secretary, as a bull. The British Tamil Conservatives wrote: ""It's anti-Hindu. It portrays the Home Secretary, of Hindu origin, as a cow. A sacred symbol for Hindus. It's racist and misogynist. It's plainly unacceptable! It may constitute a hate crime.""
Few Telegraph readers, I among them, will sympathise with Mr Bell's political views. But he makes a formidable impact precisely because he takes no prisoners, and stands in a direct line in his art from Hogarth and the most virulent Georgian cartoonists.
Like Hogarth, Bell is often deeply distasteful and verges on the obscene; his claim that he is not racist requires serious debate. He seeks to mock and to revile people of whom he disapproves by making them into grotesques, and he has over the years done this with little regard to their race. A revolting cartoon on the death of Margaret Thatcher, whom he vilified for years, showed her going to Hell but asking: ""Why is this pit still open?""
Lefties loved it; the rest of us were disgusted, but took it as the price we pay for living in a free society. He recently depicted Michael Gove as a goat; Boris Johnson is depicted with a backside for his face (and, in the same cartoon featuring Ms Patel, with a ring through his nose and horns on his head). In Mr Bell's view, being Jewish, or Hindu, may not exempt someone from being worthy of attack in the most offensive way. It is what he has done to scores of white politicians over four decades. He is an equal opportunity cartoonist.
His critics argue that there is a world of difference between depicting Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, meeting Theresa May while a Palestinian roasts in the fireplace behind them (a cartoon of 2018 that Mr Bell's editor refused to publish) and repeatedly deriding John Major, as he famously did in the 1990s, by depicting him wearing his underpants over his trousers. I find Mr Bell's repeated attacks on Netanyahu deeply unpleasant, but in a free society one should not deny him the chance to make his points. It is also far from certain that most of his newspaper's readers would disagree with him, the cause of Palestinians have been dear to their hearts for many years, and Mr Netanyahu one of their favourite hate-figures.
Mr Bell is accused of is not drawing a distinction between the activities of the state of Israel (against which a perfectly rational case can be made, even if one does not agree with it - and I generally don't) and broadcasting a blanket dislike of Jews (for which a rational case cannot be made). There is a sensitivity to anti-semitic tropes, which he himself has satirised, making the point that he dislikes Israeli policy because of what it is, not because of who actually executes it.
Some of his cartoons - in particular those featuring Jews as puppet masters - have been likened to those that used to appear in Nazi publications. He has been his own worst enemy - and there is, as the old joke goes, some competition for that post, by not making a convincing case for his lack of anti-semitism. Perhaps he is so convinced he isn't one that he feels he doesn't need to, but it might have helped him concede that there was scope for debate on the issue. His editor, for one, seems to have thought so.
His depiction of Ms Patel with horns coming from her head and a ring through her nose was decreed especially offensive because of the bovine's sacredness to the Hindu religion. I don't doubt it was appalling, and it is quite likely that Mr Bell has little time for religion generally (though it would be good to see him engage quite so robustly with unpleasant Muslims as he does with the Jews, Christians and Hindus of whom he disapproves). But it will strike many people as the sort of thing a politically-driven left-wing cartoonist does to a Conservative Home Secretary, and as part of our cherished commitment to freedom of expression. 
One doubts Mr Bell will starve from a want of work. He has considerable talent, even if some of his views and the means by which he conveys them are pretty repellent, and he will find a canvas for his work. I hope he does, much as I disagree with almost every view I have ever seen him express. For we technically live in a free society, though one just made a fraction less so by the editor of the Guardian's decision to dismiss her problematical cartoonist, a man of a type that only a truly free society can sustain.

By Michael Bernstein and Emily Ekins
Political polarization is rapidly becoming one of the greatest public issues of our time. As the Pew Research Center has found, fewer Americans are taking centrist views while more are shifting toward the extremes. The consequences are dire: the Pew Research Center found that 73% of Americans say Republicans and Democrats ""not only disagree over plans and policies, but also cannot agree on basic facts."" And animus has turned personal; one PRRI study found that 35% of Republicans and 45% of Democrats would be very unhappy if their child married someone from the opposing party.
What accounts for this polarization? Are Americans just more divided over policies, like tax rates, abortion, and immigration? Or are we living in a more tribal era in which political attitudes are driven by partisan loyalties and animus toward opponentsregardless of the policy?
Some may recall when the Jimmy Kimmel show asked Hillary Clinton voters in 2016 if they supported a plan to cut corporate and estate taxes while telling them the plan was Clinton's idea. The interviewees dutifully agreed, only to be told later that it was actually proposed by Trump rather than Clinton. Kimmel concluded, ""It seems to me most people pick a candidate and go along with whatever that candidate says.""
So which is it? Do voters just pick a candidate and align their opinions with that person? Or do voters select candidates who best represent their policy views? One of us (Michael Bernstein) collaborated with psychologists Nick Zambrotta (University of Massachusetts - Dartmouth), Lauren Micalizzi (Brown University), and Scott Martin (Brigham Young University Idaho) to find out.
The researchers recruited 195 college students across three universities asking their opinion about several policies from both the Obama and Trump administrations. (See Appendix A for further details.) While the context and specifics of various plans will always differ between two administrations, the researchers selected broad policies that apply to both presidents. The researchers randomly assigned whether students were told that the policy came from President Obama or President Trump.[i] But the policy description itself was identical between conditions. By only varying the president that each policy is attributed to, the researchers were able to examine how support for the same policies differ according to the person enacting them. Here's what they found:
Experiment 1: Immigration at the Border
In 2018, the Associated Press released a bombshell report of immigrant children being held in overcrowded ""cages created by metal fencing."" But then the New York Post reported that some of the photographic evidence was actually taken in 2014, during the Obama administration (although reasons for detainment and the number of detained children differed). This offered a great opportunity for an experiment. Would Americans feel differently about holding immigrant children in overcrowded cells if they thought it happened under Obama or Trump?
Study participants were randomly divided into two groups in which one half read that ""Trump"" had ""come under intense criticism for keeping many immigrants, including children, in overcrowded holding cells."" The other half read the same question but were told that ""Obama"" had done this. They were then asked if they agreed or disagreed that keeping immigrant children in overcrowded holding cells is ""a health concern and human rights violation.""
As you can see, partisans react very differently depending on whether the Trump or Obama administration was said to have kept immigrant children in overcrowded holding cells. When this was presented as Obama's policy, nearly half (44%) of Republicans ""strongly agreed"" it was a human rights violation and health concern. But only 13% of Republicans thought so when told this was Trump's policya 31 percentage point drop. In either condition, Democrats were more alarmed at keeping immigrant children in holding cells. But while 63% of Democrats strongly agreed it was a violation when told it was Obama's policy, this share rose to 95% if told it was Trump's policya 32 percentage point increase. When examining how many participants indicated they either somewhat or strongly agree that immigrant children in overcrowded holding cells is a health concern and human rights violation, the same trend emerges. For Republicans, 70% believe it's a human rights violation if told it was Obama's policy but only 36% agreed if told it was Trump's policy. Among Democrats, 84% indicated they agree if told it was Obama's policy and 95% agreed under Trump.
Taken these results together, we see that Obama causes greater consensus on this issue: Republican and Democratic voters are 19 points apart in strong agreement that keeping immigrant children in overcrowded holding cells is a human rights violation. But Trump polarizes peopleleading to a whopping 82-point difference between partisans.
These data imply that rising public support for increasing immigration, as Gallup found, may be partly accelerated in reaction to Trump. For those in favor of more liberalized immigration policies, Trump likely has done much for galvanizing support in favor of more immigration.
Experiment 2: Free Trade
While President Trump is known for his hardline trade stance, both Trump and Obama put tariffs on goods from China. Thus, the next experiment divided respondents into two groups and told one group that President Trump (and the other President Obama) had imposed tariffs on China because ""they do not play by the same set of economic rules as the rest of the world."" Then they were asked if they supported the tariffs on China.
Again, partisans' attitudes about free trade vary tremendously depending on whether they believed that Trump or Obama imposed the tariffs. Democratic voters were 4 times as likely to support tariffs on China when told Obama imposed them (58%) than Trump (14%)this is a 44-point drop. Notice also, a majority of Democrats support tariffs if proposed by a Democratic president but turn toward freer trade under Trump. Republicans were more supportive of trade restrictions regardless of the president. But, more Republicans (67%) supported tariffs if Trump imposed them than if Obama (48%) did soa 19-point difference.
These data suggest that polls finding support for free trade at an ""all time high,"" may be the result of Democratic backlash against Trump's restrictionist stance on trade.
Experiment 3: Government Lowering Drug Prices
How strong is conservative commitment to the free market in health care? The next experiment suggests perhaps not very if Republican leadership jettisons market-based solutions. Again people were randomly divided into two groups and asked if they supported President Trump's (or President Obama's) ""plan of having the government intervene to lower prescription drug prices.""
Most Republican participants opposed government intervention if they thought the plan was proposed by Obama with only 24% in support. However, support rose dramatically to 72% in support if Trump proposed the plan. Regardless of the president, Democrats were far more supportive of government lowering drug prices. But somewhat fewer would support it if presented as Trump's plan (86%) than Obama's plan (97%).
Unlike most of the other experiments, Trump, rather than Obama, acts as a more unifying figure. When it comes to government reducing drug prices, Obama polarizes people. It may be that when Trump proposes a policy Democrats already strongly support, it retains Democratic approval and then adds Republican support. Whereas, if Obama proposed the policy, Republicans would not feel the pull of partisan loyalty to support the plan.
Experiment 4: Government Fighting the Opioid Epidemic
In the next experiment, respondents were asked if they supported increasing federal funding ""to help curb the opioid epidemic"" even though the ""federal budget is tightly constrained."" Democrats overwhelmingly supported this spending regardless of whether they were told Obama proposed it (81%) or Trump did (84%). But Republican support rose moderately from 48% if it were Obama's plan to 61% if they were told it was Trump's plan.
Experiment 5: Iran Sanctions
In another experiment, respondents were asked if they supported imposing economic sanctions on Iran. However, one-half of the participants were told that Obama had imposed them, while the other half were told that Trump had done so.
Democrats were nearly twice as likely to support sanctions if Obama announced them (46%) than if Trump did so (24%). Republicans were more supportive in either condition, but somewhat more supportive of sanctions if they thought Trump imposed them (53%) than if they thought Obama did (42%). Taking these together, we find that Obama has a more unifying effect on public support for Iranian economic sanctions: Democratic and Republican voter support differs by about 4 points. But Trump polarizes people leading to a partisan gap of 29 points. If people believe Trump is behind the sanctions, Democratic support drops by nearly half and Republican support edges up by about 10 points.
Experiment 6: Drone Strikes
According to The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, both the Obama and Trump administrations launched drone strikes in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen that had resulted in some civilians being killed. Thus, another experiment randomly divided respondents into two groups and asked if they supported a drone strike in the Middle East ordered by Obama (or Trump) that resulted in the death of suspected terrorists but also included civilian causalities.
Regardless of partisanship, few Americans support drone strikes that could result in civilian causalities. However, Democrats were about three times as likely to support a drone strike if they thought it was ordered by Obama (12%) than if they thought it was ordered by Trump (4%). Republicans were already more likely to support such a strike, but they were nearly twice as likely to support it coming from Trump (15%) as they would if they thought the order came from Obama (9%).
Experiment 7: Hate Crimes
The next experiment took a step back from public policy and examined public reaction to hate crimes. As it turns out, even interpretation of hate crimes is affected by party. Half of respondents were told that ""after a hate crime resulted in the death of several U.S. citizens in 2016"" that President Obama gave a speech that said the attack was ""an attack on all Americans.""[ii] The other half of respondents were told that Trump had said this.[iii] (Both Obama and Trump described a hate crime that occurred during their respective administrations as an attack or assault ""on all of us."") Then respondents were asked if they agreed or disagreed that a ""hate crime committed in the United States constitutes an attack on all Americans.""
While 36% of Republicans agreed if told that Obama had said this, this share rises to 70% if told Trump said ita 34-point increase. In reverse, 76% of Democrats agreed if told Obama said this while less than half (44%) agreed if told Trump said it. Both Trump and Obama polarize Americans when it comes to thinking about hate crimes in the United States. Americans interpret the validity of the president's points on this contentious topic largely through a partisan lens.
Implications
These data demonstrate that partisans allow the political leaders they like and dislike to color their views of public policy. Republican participants were more likely to favor the same described policy under Trump than Obama. Similarly, Democratic participants were more likely to favor the same described policy under Obama versus Trump. This is evidence that people are not objectively judging the merits of a policy. Instead, policy support depends not only on political ideology (e.g. Republicans are overall more supportive of drone strikes than Democrats) but also on the president who is promoting the policy.
This poses a serious concern for our ability to effectively communicate and reach consensus with one another about political issues. How can we forthrightly debate the merits of a presidential action when its support is, to some degree, a function of the person who occupies the Oval office?
If we want to find common ground, it is important to recognize tribalism, how we ourselves may be affected by it, and consider how it may shape the attitudes of our public.

 I spent most of last summer on the stoop of my retired neighbor Richie, who would be out front most mornings as I -- the professor on vacation -- would pass by with my dog.
 ''Come by for a beer later,'' he'd suggest. And I always would.
 The school year ended our ritual. Coronavirus brought it back.
 Richie has a wraparound front terrace with benches and plants alongside his stoop, but I sit on a stool on the sidewalk now. Another neighbor, Jim, always joins us at 5 p.m. sharp.

As the lockdown took hold, the sirens were nonstop. It has been both disconcerting and strangely reassuring to see the truck traffic remain relatively steady -- Port Morris is a largely industrial neighborhood.
 Capitalism doesn't stop, and neither does the air pollution here, but it's our normal, and I guess it beats the sirens. I wonder how many trucks carry food or supplies into Manhattan, and I'm reminded that expressways are Robert Moses's legacy to the South Bronx, a largely Latino and black area that has already borne the brunt of a pandemic that has everything to do with the air we breathe.
 We are mostly Puerto Rican on our block, so I can tell it's a nice day outside when I hear the neighbors joking in Spanglish or salsa playing.
 Today someone was fixing a car, someone else let the dog out, then the young motorcyclists paid us their usual Sunday visit, fleeting shadows under the light from the mattress factory across the street. Randalls Island, with its armies of joggers, is just down the road, yet it feels a world away. There are few of us, but when the music drowns out the expressway, I tell myself that maybe we'll have summer in New York City after all. -- Urayoán Noel, Port Morris, the Bronx
 Visits from a distance
 I live on the second floor of a building on Central Park West and have had numerous friends stop by my window for a Rapunzelian chat. A terrific decorator named Brian McCarthy was a fun one. Also, I waved to a friend with her husband, about to walk across the park to Mt. Sinai to give birth (It was a boy.)
 A work colleague visits the most regularly after his bike rides around the Central Park peripherique. Our neighbor shouts when she's out walking her dogs. My father even came on my birthday and stood in the rain. I threw down an umbrella. -- Charles Curkin, Upper West Side, Manhattan
 You need anything?
 The physical separation of water between Staten Island and the city can make you feel extra close. A couple next door, Joe and Lucille, remind me of my own long-gone parents, their necessary distance from their own children tugging at my heart.
 The other day, I called to see if they needed anything and half-joked not to ask for toilet tissue. Later that afternoon, I found on my stoop a six-pack of toilet paper and two fat rolls of paper towels. When my phone rang, it was Joe on the other end: ''We left you a little present because we had extra.'' -- Amy Zavatto, St. George, Staten Island
 Easter eggs and fresh-baked bread
 The Bronx was silent. Usually I could hear the smack talk of men wrapping up their domino games, or bachata playing loudly from the bodega. But the bodega owners had stopped allowing late night hangouts.
 Inside my building, people helped each other. My neighbor Bianka Medina, an M.T.A. employee and a baker, brought my family meals. My mother visited neighbors, asking who needed what before she went to the supermarket. As for the children, Bianka's 5-year-old daughter went around the building with a tray of Easter eggs and treats on Easter Sunday. Of course the tray included a large Purell bottle. -- Elizabeth Duluc, University Heights, the Bronx
 Late April: After the peak
 The soloist on the fire escape
 I could not remember the last time I heard a voice in the hallway or met someone on the stoop. Of the 20 apartments in my tenement, a phantom few seem inhabited. Street-facing windows were dark at night. Departures had been hurried, given the pyramid of unclaimed packages in the foyer. My neighbors could have vanished by the Rapture for all I knew.
 When the 7 o'clock cheer for front-line workers started, I felt more connected, however anonymously, to two women in the tenement across the street. They raised their windows to whoop each night and taped up a handwritten sign facing our building, asking, HOW YOU DOIN'?
 The day John Prine died, they blared his music. Another night, Neil Diamond's ''Sweet Caroline,'' pealed out. Then, those women's windows went dark.
 The absence made me crane my neck for kinship elsewhere. That's when I heard the strains of an electric guitar playing ''The Star-Spangled Banner,'' Jimi Hendrix-style. -- Julie Besonen, East Village, Manhattan
 Making friends with the enemy
 In my neighborhood in Queens, there is a yellow townhouse. Every day, the men who live on the block gather there to drink beer and chain smoke on the front patio. A couple of them wear masks, though most of them don't bother. Their piece of sidewalk is littered with butts in the morning.
 A few years ago this house was a problem. When I walked by, I would get catcalled; sometimes I'd cross over to the other side of the street just to avoid it.
 One day, fed up, I walked up to the main culprit and shook his hand -- this was long before coronavirus. I told him my name, and asked him to stop. After that, whenever I saw him, he would wave at me and say hello.
 Recently I passed by and didn't see anyone at the house. The whole street was quiet. Maybe that's it, I thought. Maybe one of them got sick. I lowered my head and kept walking.
 But the next day they were at it again, laughing and drinking and playing music. As I walked by wearing my mask, I waved. One of them looked up and shouted, ''Keep the corona away!'' Then he added, laughing, ''But have a Heineken.'' -- Sasha von Oldershausen, Jamaica, Queens
 The grass grew, and the neighbors worried.
 David Rodriguez has known his father's neighbors for more than 30 years. It's a block of retired police officers, firefighters, and nurses.
 In early May, he visited to work on his dad's car, and worried neighbors came over to chat. ''They saw the grass growing and the mail piling up,'' Mr. Rodriguez said, ''so they feared the worst.''
 He reassured them his father was ''watching Netflix and walking on his treadmill'' in Miami, where he has been stranded since lockdown.
 David, who is an EMT, is currently working at a Covid testing site. But why work indoors, asked a retired firefighter across the street, when you could be having fun in an ambulance?
 ''I'm 50, I can't be carrying people down five flights of stairs,'' David told him. ''He still thinks I'm 20 years old.'' -- Eveline Chao, Oakwood Heights, Staten Island
 For the undocumented, 'There's no stimulus package.'
 Barbecues, quinceañeras, baby showers and baptisms. Evening chats on lawn chairs along the sidewalk while the children played in the street. That was life in Joel Salguero's building, where he has been the superintendent for 15 years, before the coronavirus. Nowadays, he said, the residents stay behind closed doors.
 Many of his neighbors are undocumented Latinos who lost their jobs at the start of the pandemic and are now working part-time, he said. Mr. Salguero collects rent for all 40 units; only a few of the tenants have been able to pay in full.
 Several residents also got sick.
 Neighbors are helping one another, as they are afraid to go to the hospital. When a woman in her 70s who lost her job as a nanny grew ill, they took turns leaving food by her front door.
 One of them was the super's wife, Alejandra Salguero. A nanny herself who commutes all the way to Shelter Island, Ms. Salguero, during her time off, waits in line at a nearby church that's been distributing food, and brings a bag to her older neighbor. She has also given her money.
 For undocumented people, she said, ''there's no stimulus package.'' -- Fabrice Robinet, Sunset Park, Brooklyn
 Pineapple express on the Brooklyn waterfront
 The mood was tense at the Red Hook Houses, the second largest low-income housing project in the city, said Karen Blondel, an organizer and longtime resident. Because of the Hurricane Sandy renovations that still aren't finished, there was no safe space to socialize, so residents kept to themselves. They were very much on edge.
 And then the pineapples arrived.
 A shipment of 20,000 from Costa Rica to be exact, donated by the Red Hook Container Terminal down the street. They asked Ms. Blondel to help pass them around.
 ''My friend Charlene got a U-Haul truck and came over to load up,'' Ms. Blondel said. The pineapples were delivered to nonprofits and low-income housing, including the Red Hook Houses.
 People responded with photos of themselves drinking Piña Coladas and pineapple tea.
 ''It was the perfect fruit for the pandemic,'' Ms. Blondel said. ''It lifted me, and it lifted other people. -- Lisa M. Collins, Red Hook, Brooklyn
 He's got a keyboard. And a following.
 Anthony Ramirez felt kind of queasy about plunking the Yamaha Motif XS8 on his family porch. ''What if the neighbors get mad at me?'' he recalled thinking. ''And police come?''
 A couple months in, ''Tony the piano player"" enjoys near-celebrity status on his block in the Bronx, where he lives in a two-story apartment building his parents bought 36 years ago.
 He plays every morning at 11 (''had to be after seniors' privileged time at Costco and ShopRite''), and he takes requests. Drake is a Taylor Avenue favorite; so is George Michael. ''Adele definitely gets people singing, though.''
 The boingy baselines Tony uses have a certain, irresistible ''Seinfeld'' theme song quality -- even the letter carrier takes a break to listen. There is no tip jar, so neighbors have taken to leaving bottles of wine on Anthony's porch. -- Paige Darrah, Parkchester, the Bronx
 Seizing the sidewalks
 Three times a week, the Chinatown Block Watch assembles on Mott Street. Karlin Chan formed the group to ''serve as a visible deterrent,'' he said, to the recent rise in hate crimes against Asians.
 On a recent afternoon, about a dozen volunteers headed up Mott Street, ducking into businesses to give out fliers that said ''No face mask/No entry'' in English and Chinese.
 Richie Cheung had joined the group for the first time that day. ''I feel great, man; I feel like I'm doing something for the community,'' he said. ''It's good for the soul.'' -- Eveline Chao, Chinatown, Manhattan
 May: Stirrings of Hope
 Chalk therapy
 Across the street, my neighbor Christina Crespo has been chalking inspirational messages on her stoop. She and her children put out a quote request box for passers-by.
 From my window, I've watched people stop to snap pics, and after each rainfall, a new quote always appears. ''I started to follow these beautiful female poets and writers of color on Instagram and I was so touched by their words,'' said Christina, a third generation Puerto Rican American who is raising her children in her grandparents' home. ''I wanted to spread that bit of magic with everyone who walked by.'' -- Marj Kleinman, Boerum Hill, Brooklyn
 Go deep!
 My neighbors, a group of young fit dudes, have taken to pulling out lawn chairs, cracking open beers, and hanging out in shorts and flip-flops in front of their building. It's a kind of polite and respectful Midtown frat party.
 In April, they took to the street to run sprint drills and play long-distance catch with a football. The backdrop for their recreation happened to be one of the most interesting buildings in Manhattan: Philip Johnson's 1950 Rockefeller Guest House, a Modernist masterpiece that is Johnson's only private residence in New York City, hiding in plain sight on East 52nd Street.
 Watching them hang out in front of this little-known architectural marvel got me thinking about the importance we accord to certain things in New York, like luxury real estate, and how those values can look radically different at a time like this.
 As two of the guys aimlessly tossed a ball in front of the petite historic building the other day, the last line of the poem ''Ozymandias'' came to mind: ''Round the decay of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare, the lone and level sands stretch far away.'' -- Alex Vadukul, Midtown East, Manhattan
 The hanging gardens of Flushing, Queens
 My wife, Lu Zhang, had been trying to grow a plant from her grandfather's backyard in Xi'an, China. It's known for its medicinal properties, and it had been growing but not thriving. One morning our neighbor Ah Hua, originally from Fujian province, reached across the little railing that separates our balconies and handed my wife a full, lush version of the plant! Ah Hua, it turns out, had been pursuing the same goal, and her soil-fertilization techniques had paid off. They've been trading gardening tips since. -- Herb Tam, Flushing, Queens
 When happy hour is any hour
 Shortly after lockdown was announced, Mel's Burger Bar removed its front windows and set up a well-stocked bar in there. The drinkers came quickly. Some wore masks, some smoked cigarettes, others brought their dogs. Soon other restaurants followed.
 This new social hour is happening at any hour of the day. People lean on cars or bikes, they sit on stoops or stair railings. Outdoor speakers push Elton John, Spin Doctors, and Jonas Brothers. The lure is seductive.
 One warm evening in May, I watched a group of 40- and 50-somethings singing on a crosswalk island -- past tipsy but not quite drunk. No one was wearing a mask. Their collective attitude seemed to be: ''We've earned this.'' -- Alix Strauss, Upper East Side, Manhattan
 June: A city awakens
 Brooklyn's stoop
 The grand steps at Brooklyn's Borough Hall have long provided a public stoop for all Brooklynites, who come to gather, eat lunch, and protest.
 These steps also lead to the current home of Brooklyn's borough president, Eric Adams, who moved into the municipal building at the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak. He regularly shares short social media videos on health, self-care, mindfulness and empowerment from the foot of his futon, a short commute from his desk.
 ''We are using Borough Hall as a command center to coordinate the borough's response to Covid-19 and the protests gripping Brooklyn now,'' Mr. Adams said.
 He has been on the ground each day, distributing meals, delivering masks and engaging with protesters. ''Covid-19 didn't put other crises in the borough on hold,'' he said. ''If anything, it magnified issues like lack of affordable housing, poverty, food insecurity, and so much more.''
 He will often join his constituents on the steps, and has especially made his presence known during the protests.
 A retired N.Y.P.D. captain, Adams knows the danger of unchecked policing. As a teenager, he and his brother were badly beaten by police officers in Queens. This incident motivated him to get involved with public service. In 1995 he co-founded ''100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care,'' an advocacy group that speaks out against police brutality and racial profiling.
 In 2013, he became the first African-American borough president of Brooklyn.
 Borough Hall faces Cadman Plaza Park, the site of the June 4 memorial for George Floyd, which was organized by his brother, Terrence Floyd, a Brooklyn resident. -- Marj Kleinman, Downtown Brooklyn
 'For now, it's all ours'
 Grove is one of those quaint West Village streets that on normal days often gets overrun by tourists (''Look, it's the 'Friends' building!''). But these are far from normal days, so the neighborhood has been getting back some of its ''locals only'' vibe.
 The routine goes something like this: shut down the computer at 6, grab a tallboy of Modelo from the deli on Christopher, head over to the stoop, then get ready for the parade.
 So many dogs! But in the current dynamic, it's the actual owners doing their own walking (''Oh, you're Caleb's mom!''), and no one gives you the side-eye or tries to hurry along when you reach out to pet Layla or Mowgli.
 Friends from the neighborhood often stroll by to download the latest news (MeMe reopened, someone saw Artie doing jumping jacks by the river, the Radio Bar crew is heading over to the rally at noon).
 And people linger, whether for a beer, a smoke, a gab about this, a gab about that. We're all in this together, you know. We didn't leave our awesome 'hood. It's nice here, and for now, it's all ours. -- Parrish Griggs, West Village, Manhattan
 Tenants are organizing
 Two neighboring buildings on 139th Street in the Bronx, one that has not had gas since October, went on rent strike in April. A local restaurant, La Morada, showed solidarity by donating meals to the residents. Eventually, one building pulled out of the rent strike, and Black Lives Matter took center stage. Recently, 139th Street became the backdrop for peaceful protests. La Morada, meanwhile, continues its food donation efforts. -- Dakota Santiago, Mott Haven, the Bronx
 Friends and neighbors
 Every night, the residents of 28th Street, some of them front-line workers, check in with one another.
 The physical therapist recounts her relentless stints at the hospital, where her team helps rotate Covid patients on ventilators; the doctor across the street hands a loaf of her homemade sourdough. She offers him fresh-picked rhubarb.
 ''The pandemic and protests have changed our relationship,'' said Brendan Fay, an L.G.B.T.Q. activist who lives on the block. ''The word 'neighbor' has taken on a new meaning. We now greet each other with more than a polite hello; we've crossed a line with each other.''
 One of the 28th Street gang recently suggested that it may be time to stop the ritual salutes. Mr. Fay won't hear of it.
 ''Among us, there's a woman whose daughter-in-law is fighting Covid-19 and has pneumonia,'' he said. ''She told me this helps her get through the day. I don't want to see this end; perhaps it will grow and evolve into something bigger.'' -- Nancy A. Ruhling, Astoria, Queens

It was also about staying safe from COVID-19, speaking out for Black Lives Matter, racial justice and political activism, and opposing systemic racism and voter suppression. The New York Times' review of the year gives deference to off-the-court/field issues over championships won. 
The NYT story by Liz Robbins[1] says the 'troubled, truncated 2020 sports season' will be remembered as the Year of the Bubble. Apandemicraged on and protests of systemic racism rocked the United States, but athletes played on.2020 was about more than finding a way to play, Robbins writes. The Florida bubbles of the WNBA and NBA projected the voices of the players in support of Black Lives Matter after the deaths of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd.Super Bowl and NBA championships took a back seat toboycotted games in multiple sports due to the Jacob Blake shooting. George Hill[2]of the Milwaukee Bucks demanded that the Wisconsin Legislature convene to discuss police reform. Kneeling, protest and social justice slogans spread from U.S. athletes and leagues around the world to international sports.In 2020, LeBron James fought against voter suppression. African American NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace found a noose in a race car garage (The Wall Street Journal exposed the truth: it was only a rope handle used to open a garage door, not a hate crime[3]), Los Angeles Clippers then-coach Doc Rivers gave a teary speech about his fear of being a Black man. Sarah Fuller made a few kicks for the Vanderbilt football team in a giant leap for womankind.There was much more of this nonsense. Pro basketball courts in the bubbles displayed the words 'Black Lives Matter.'[4] WNBA players openly campaigned for pro-abortion Georgia Democrat Senate candidate Ralph Warnock - and against Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, co-owner of the Atlanta Dream, who dared question the league's infatuation with BLM. 'The NHL made strides in addressing racism.' NFL helmets and end zones portrayed social justice slogans.Robbins' review of the year in sports credits Chris Paul, president of the NBA Players Association, for saying the record presidential voter turnout and Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s victory over President Trump (a critic of the NBA) 'should make players proud.'In Robbins' world, college sports 'failed to hold the pretense of the student-athlete experience' while its athletes 'were essentially unpaid laborers during a pandemic' who negotiated for their name, image and likeness, which the NCAA still has to approve. Looking ahead, Robbins writes that the next lightning rod on the social justice front could be the Olympic movement. The U.S. Olympic Committee recently bowed to pressure from SJW athletes and cleared the way for them to shame their country[5] at the 2021 Tokyo Summer Olympics. The gutless USOC also apologized for previously punishing hammer thrower Gwen Berry for raising a fist in protest of the U.S. during the 2018 Pan American Games.This largely sports-less review of the year in sports closes with a quote by Nneka Ogwumike, a forward with the Los Angeles Sparks and president of the WNBA Players Association, who said: 'It's wonderful to see that in a world in which debris is just falling everywhere, you still have these special moments. They are not moments, themselves; they are movements.'

Impromptu concerts from the fire escape. Food relief efforts staged on the sidewalk in front of a church. Friends spread out on the stoop and drinking tallboys. As the city reopens, New Yorkers emerging from quarantine might feel a bit nostalgic for the socially distant bonds they formed outside their homes. From the first days of the lockdown in April, through the advent of legal drinking in front of restaurants, to protests in the streets for racial justice, The Times collected stories of how neighbors across the five boroughs handled the shutdown and, at times, came together.
Early April: New York on pause
Getting the guys together
I spent most of last summer on the stoop of my retired neighbor Richie, who would be out front most mornings as I — the professor on vacation — would pass by with my dog.
“Come by for a beer later,” he’d suggest. And I always would.
The school year ended our ritual. Coronavirus brought it back.
Richie has a wraparound front terrace with benches and plants alongside his stoop, but I sit on a stool on the sidewalk now. Another neighbor, Jim, always joins us at 5 p.m. sharp.
We greet those who pass, chat with other neighbors, and check in with Walter, the letter carrier. With a view of the harbor in the distance, we talk about the news and the things we appreciate, like being alive in our blessed city, while we watch the sun set behind Lady Liberty. — Andrew Cotto, Greenwood Heights, Brooklyn

The boingy baselines Tony uses have a certain, irresistible “Seinfeld” theme song quality — even the letter carrier takes a break to listen. There is no tip jar, so neighbors have taken to leaving bottles of wine on Anthony’s porch. — Paige Darrah, Parkchester, the Bronx
Seizing the sidewalks
Three times a week, the Chinatown Block Watch assembles on Mott Street. Karlin Chan formed the group to “serve as a visible deterrent,” he said, to the recent rise in hate crimes against Asians.
On a recent afternoon, about a dozen volunteers headed up Mott Street, ducking into businesses to give out fliers that said “No face mask/No entry” in English and Chinese.
Richie Cheung had joined the group for the first time that day. “I feel great, man; I feel like I’m doing something for the community,” he said. “It’s good for the soul.” — Eveline Chao, Chinatown, Manhattan
May: Stirrings of Hope
Chalk therapy
Across the street, my neighbor Christina Crespo has been chalking inspirational messages on her stoop. She and her children put out a quote request box for passers-by.
From my window, I’ve watched people stop to snap pics, and after each rainfall, a new quote always appears. “I started to follow these beautiful female poets and writers of color on Instagram and I was so touched by their words,” said Christina, who is raising her children in her grandparents’ home. “I wanted to spread that bit of magic with everyone who walked by.” — Marj Kleinman, Boerum Hill, Brooklyn
Go deep!
My neighbors, a group of young fit dudes, have taken to pulling out lawn chairs, cracking open beers, and hanging out in shorts and flip-flops in front of their building. It’s a kind of polite and respectful Midtown frat party.
In April, they took to the street to run sprint drills and play long-distance catch with a football. The backdrop for their recreation happened to be one of the most interesting buildings in Manhattan: Philip Johnson’s 1950 Rockefeller Guest House, a Modernist masterpiece that is Johnson’s only private residence in New York City, hiding in plain sight on East 52nd Street.
Watching them hang out in front of this little-known architectural marvel got me thinking about the importance we accord to certain things in New York, like luxury real estate, and how those values can look radically different at a time like this.
As two of the guys aimlessly tossed a ball in front of the petite historic building the other day, the last line of the poem “Ozymandias” came to mind: “Round the decay of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare, the lone and level sands stretch far away.” — Alex Vadukul, Midtown East, Manhattan
The hanging gardens of Flushing, Queens
My wife, Lu Zhang, had been trying to grow a plant from her grandfather’s backyard in Xi’an, China. It’s known for its medicinal properties, and it had been growing but not thriving. One morning our neighbor Ah Hua, originally from Fujian province, reached across the little railing that separates our balconies and handed my wife a full, lush version of the plant! Ah Hua, it turns out, had been pursuing the same goal, and her soil-fertilization techniques had paid off. They’ve been trading gardening tips since. — Herb Tam, Flushing, Queens
When happy hour is any hour
Shortly after lockdown was announced, Mel’s Burger Bar removed its front windows and set up a well-stocked bar in there. The drinkers came quickly. Some wore masks, some smoked cigarettes, others brought their dogs. Soon other restaurants followed.
This new social hour is happening at any hour of the day. People lean on cars or bikes, they sit on stoops or stair railings. Outdoor speakers push Elton John, Spin Doctors, and Jonas Brothers. The lure is seductive.
One warm evening in May, I watched a group of 40- and 50-somethings singing on a crosswalk island — past tipsy but not quite drunk. No one was wearing a mask. Their collective attitude seemed to be: “We’ve earned this.” — Alix Strauss, Upper East Side, Manhattan
June: A city awakens
Brooklyn’s stoop
The grand steps at Brooklyn’s Borough Hall have long provided a public stoop for all Brooklynites, who come to gather, eat lunch, and protest.
These steps also lead to the current home of Brooklyn’s borough president, Eric Adams, who moved into the municipal building at the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak. He regularly shares short social media videos on health, self-care, mindfulness and empowerment from the foot of his futon, a short commute from his desk.
“We are using Borough Hall as a command center to coordinate the borough’s response to Covid-19 and the protests gripping Brooklyn now,” Mr. Adams said.
He has been on the ground each day, distributing meals, delivering masks and engaging with protesters. “Covid-19 didn’t put other crises in the borough on hold,” he said. “If anything, it magnified issues like lack of affordable housing, poverty, food insecurity, and so much more.”
He will often join his constituents on the steps, and has especially made his presence known during the protests.
A retired N.Y.P.D. captain, Adams knows the danger of unchecked policing. As a teenager, he and his brother were badly beaten by police officers in Queens. This incident motivated him to get involved with public service. In 1995 he co-founded “100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care,” an advocacy group that speaks out against police brutality and racial profiling.
In 2013, he became the first African-American borough president of Brooklyn.
Borough Hall faces Cadman Plaza Park, the site of the June 4 memorial for George Floyd, which was organized by his brother, Terrence Floyd, a Brooklyn resident. — Marj Kleinman, Downtown Brooklyn
‘For now, it’s all ours’
Grove is one of those quaint West Village streets that on normal days often gets overrun by tourists (“Look, it’s the ‘Friends’ building!”). But these are far from normal days, so the neighborhood has been getting back some of its “locals only” vibe.
The routine goes something like this: shut down the computer at 6, grab a tallboy of Modelo from the deli on Christopher, head over to the stoop, then get ready for the parade.
So many dogs! But in the current dynamic, it’s the actual owners doing their own walking (“Oh, you’re Caleb’s mom!”), and no one gives you the side-eye or tries to hurry along when you reach out to pet Layla or Mowgli.
Friends from the neighborhood often stroll by to download the latest news (MeMe reopened, someone saw Artie doing jumping jacks by the river, the Radio Bar crew is heading over to the rally at noon).
And people linger, whether for a beer, a smoke, a gab about this, a gab about that. We’re all in this together, you know. We didn’t leave our awesome ’hood. It’s nice here, and for now, it’s all ours. — Parrish Griggs, West Village, Manhattan
Tenants are organizing
Two neighboring buildings on 139th Street in the Bronx, one that has not had gas since October, went on rent strike in April. A local restaurant, La Morada, showed solidarity by donating meals to the residents. Eventually, one building pulled out of the rent strike, and Black Lives Matter took center stage. Recently, 139th Street became the backdrop for peaceful protests. La Morada, meanwhile, continues its food donation efforts. — Dakota Santiago, Mott Haven, the Bronx
Friends and neighbors
Every night, the residents of 28th Street, some of them front-line workers, check in with one another.
The physical therapist recounts her relentless stints at the hospital, where her team helps rotate Covid patients on ventilators; the doctor across the street hands her a loaf of his homemade sourdough. She offers him fresh-picked rhubarb.
“The pandemic and protests have changed our relationship,” said Brendan Fay, an L.G.B.T.Q. activist who lives on the block. “The word ‘neighbor’ has taken on a new meaning. We now greet each other with more than a polite hello; we’ve crossed a line with each other.”
One of the 28th Street gang recently suggested that it may be time to stop the ritual salutes. Mr. Fay won’t hear of it.
“Among us, there’s a woman whose daughter-in-law is fighting Covid-19 and has pneumonia,” he said. “She told me this helps her get through the day. I don’t want to see this end; perhaps it will grow and evolve into something bigger.” — Nancy A. Ruhling, Astoria, Queens

Recently, I got an anonymous text with a photo attached of three teenagers, flexing, with large Swastikas on their upper arms.
I could not tell if the images were tattooed or penned, though this was clearly a message of hate.
My phone rings at 9 that night. a call from a friend in Washington, D.C. She is black, and the mother of one son. We first talk about little things, our kids, our quarantines then dive into the biggest thing that has mobilized protests in every state and on every continent -- George Perry Floyd, Jr., choking for air, a knee on his neck, calling for his mom.
We renounce together the peaks of hate crimes over the last three years, the string of racist police brutality, shootings in black churches and mosques and synagogues. I tell her about the text with Swastikas. She responds with this:
""Lots of people may hate the Jews. But you can still walk into any room and people don't know that you are Jewish. You're a white girl. I walk into a room and my skin is black. That triggers all sorts of responses, conscious and unconscious, even in the most accepting of crowds.""
Her voice softens as she talks about how fearful she is raising a black son, about to get his driver's license, who may get more than a speeding ticket if stopped by a bigoted cop.
She asks that her name not be revealed.
""My anonymity is a cloak of protection not only for myself but most importantly for my child,"" she says. ""The death of George Floyd puts on full display the very real monsters that continue to snuff out young black lives.""
All of us white girls and boys and women and men will never know what it feels like to live in the skin of a black person. We can march and kneel and pray in unison. We protest with genuine empathy and compassion, united in outrage, hundreds of thousands of us, inter-generational, multi-racial.
Though we white people, from all cultures and faiths, who feel so deeply and strive to be truly anti-racist will never know the depth of emotion behind the Black Lives Matter movement. I am not afraid that a room full of anti-Semites will peg me as Jewish the moment I walk into a room.
They cannot see the color of my heritage and heart.
These weeks of ongoing protests are a show of solidarity and awakening Yet, is this, finally, the revolution that will result in real change?
I put this question to a 70-year-old black man, who came of age as a student at Howard University in Washington, D.C., alongside the rise of Black Power. The owner of a New York contracting company, he, too, insisted on anonymity, explaining: ""When some white people read about a black person doing well, even better than them, over the years I have gotten too many incensed responses.""
Here, is more of his take on the revolution sparked in the aftermath of the killing of Floyd, this past May 25:
I am encouraged by the size and diversity of this support for Black Lives Matter because that is what is required to institute change. This is the opportunity not just to reform racist police policies but also to focus on the other killers in the black community: education reform, economic reform, housing reform, health care reform, voter suppression. It's time to address redlining, minimum wage, equal pay, creating job opportunities and job training.
What disenfranchised white people do not realize is that racism has been used to separate us when in actuality we share the same concerns and suffer from a lot of the same issues.
I am hopeful that this strengthening movement we are seeing right now can wipe out obstacles, by its very size.
Examples of this is pushing for the removal of Confederate statues like that of Robert E. Lee in Richmond. The NFL executives are finally realizing and speaking out that black lives do matters. NASCAR is removing Confederate flags from all of its events.
You are now following this newsletter. See all newsletters.
Black Lives Matter is not just a fringe group. I see this as a real and growing movement. What we are witnessing does feel different. In the past, white people would say about racist oppression, 'Oh this is terrible, how could this be happening?' And black people would answer, 'It's always been happening. You just weren't aware of it'.
The filming of George Floyd's murder was something that no one can turn away from, as the heinous crime unfolded. Anyone with a conscience cannot deny such a blatant display of racism. It reminded me of when ranchers are branding cattle. They lay them down on their side, place their knee to hold them still, and then they brand them.
I have built a good family, a long marriage and raised two college-educated kids. I have worked hard to build a successful business. As a black man, though, I have always been full of rage, too.
I helped integrate an elementary school back in the 1960s. At an early age, that gave me an understanding of what life in America was going to be like. I was beat up, and woke up.
So now, I am hopeful and at the same time realistic: I don't put anything past White Supremacists and other racists who, for whatever reason, just have a genuine hatred of black people. They don't see us as human beings. The police treated George Floyd as if he were an animal.
Black Lives Matter is moving this country in the right direction. But understand, the fight against racial injustice is far from resolved. Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Independence, ""All men are created equal"" -- yet he owned slaves. Throughout American history, there has never been an overall perception that blacks are equal to whites. Hopefully, the time has come for America to move forward.

Theannual report shared data the GTD collected throughout 2019 on terrorist attacks carried out in the U.S. and abroad and compared it with information compiled in previous years. The data included the number of attacks reported in each country, those attacks' targets, the number of victims and perpetrators killed and the organizations behind each incident.
According to the GTD's report, the mass shootings at a shopping center in El Paso, Texas, last August and at a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand last March are just two high-profile examples of the ""sharp increase in the lethality of 'racially and ethnically motivated terrorist attacks'"" seen in recent years, ""many of which were motivated by white supremacy, xenophobia and anti-immigrant beliefs.""
The report showed the number of victims killed in those specific kinds of attacks nearly tripled in four years, rising from 26 in 2015 to 89 in 2019. Meanwhile, the GTD said terrorist attacks reported globally had actually declined by 50 percent since reaching a high of about 17,000 attacks resulting in about 44,000 fatalities in 2014.
In the U.S., 64 victims were killed in 34 terrorist attacks by white supremacists and white nationalists between 2015 and 2019, the report showed. The only groups with more deaths attributed to their attacks were jihadi-inspired extremists, though the GTD said anti-government extremists matched the white supremacists' fatality numbers. In comparison, the report showed seven people were killed in the U.S. during the same time period as a result of Muslim extremist terrorist attacks.
Newsweek reached out to the Department of State's Bureau of Counterterrorism for comment but did not receive a response in time for publication.
Though white supremacy has been a point of concern in the U.S. for years, attention on racially motivated attacks by white supremacists has increased since President Donald Trump took office in 2016. Some of that attention has been attributed to Trump's hesitation to condemn white nationalists during his first year in office after a rally held to protest a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee in Charlottesville, Virginia turned deadly.
More recently, the president has been criticized for calling protesters demonstrating in support of the Black Lives Matter movement ""anarchists"" and ""terrorists,"" as well as for sharing a video on Twitter in which one person could be heard shouting ""white power.""
Reports by the Federal Bureau of Investigation show hate crimes have also been on the rise in the U.S. in recent years. According to The New York Times, violence connected to hate crimes in 2018 was the highest it had been in 16 years, though the numbers reported were estimated to be half or less than the total number of incidents that actually occurred.
The uptick in violence is part of an emerging trend in which offenders increasingly act alone or without the support of a specific group, a detail that the GTD said makes it difficult to categorize the incidents that occur.
""Perpetrators of terrorism in the United States have been very loosely organized, rarely affiliated with a formal organization, and motivated by a diverse array of ideologies,"" its report said. ""These ideologies often overlap, to the point that it can be difficult to classify the identity of the perpetrator or perpetrators in a straightforward way.""

The Atlanta protests, organized by civil rights groups, including the NAACP, gathered outside the Capitol where lawmakers were returning to work after a coronavirus shutdown. More than a thousand demonstrators demanded lawmakers take up criminal justice reform, as well as voting issues, after last week's election was marred by long lines at the polls.
A few protesters came inside the Capitol, chanting in the building's rotunda.
Several Democratic state lawmakers, who are in the minority in the Georgia House and Senate, joined the protest Monday and said they are ready to act on calls for reforms. Republican House Speaker David Ralston told lawmakers Monday he wants to pass a bill to further penalize hate crimes, saying its passage is just as important as passing a state budget. The House has previously passed a hate crimes bill, but it has stalled in the Senate.
Many Democrats are proposing an array of new legislation to reform policing practices, however Republicans, as well as some Democrats, say there is not enough time to pass a big legislative package with only 11 days remaining in the lawmakers' session following a lengthy coronavirus shutdown.
Demonstrations also took place Monday evening in Lafayette Park across the street from the White House to mark two weeks since law enforcement forcefully cleared a peaceful crowd shortly before U.S. President Donald Trump walked through the area for a photo opportunity at a nearby church.
Also Monday, the U.N. Human Rights Council agreed to hold an urgent debate on Wednesday on the current racially inspired human rights violations, systematic racism, police brutality and violence against peaceful protesters.
Sunday brought protests in many cities, including Washington, New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Miami.
Seattle situation
Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best said Sunday on the CBS network's Face the Nation that she hopes officers can move back into a section of the city taken over by peaceful protesters without resorting to something that devolves into a force situation.
Protesters have peacefully occupied a four-block part of the city which they have named Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. Organizers say they want a neighborhood without police. A huge Black Lives Matter mural covers the area's main thoroughfare.
Trump has called the occupiers ugly anarchists and said the city should take back the zone.
Speaking to reporters at the White House Monday, Trump said, the American public is very angered by what is happening in Seattle and said the media is not covering the situation enough.
He said that if the right ever took over a city, conservative Republicans took over a city, it would be the biggest story in history.
Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan last week likened the zone to a block party atmosphere and no threat to the public. She said the zone will be restored to the city at some time.
European protests
Anti-racism marches inspired by Floyd's death continued all weekend in some large European cities.
Demonstrators in Berlin formed a 9-kilometer-long chain that began at the Brandenburg Gate.
In Paris, the police protested what they say were unfair accusations of racism and brutality.
Shortly after 15,000 people demonstrated in the French capital, about 50 officers and their police cars surrounded the Arc de Triomphe.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Monday he would create a commission to look at what more can be done to fight racial inequality in Britain.
Johnson said Sunday racist thuggery has no place in British streets after right-wing extremists attacked protesters against racism. About 100 people were arrested.
London Mayor Sadiq Khan blamed the violence solely on the right-wingers and thanked police for doing a fantastic job in restoring order.
Also Sunday, hundreds marched through Tokyo, holding banners reading Black Lives Matter.
Thousands also demonstrated Sunday in New Zealand and took a knee for a moment of silence for Floyd in front of the U.S. consulate. -VOA"

Muslim World League interfaith activities
Since 2016, the Muslim World League has been praised for working to combat extremist ideology.
In January, Sheikh al-Issa led an interfaith delegation to the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial site in Poland to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi concentration and extermination camp by Soviet forces. The camp was a major site of the Holocaust, in which Nazi German authorities killed around 6 million Jews.
""Islamic principals are not double-standard. It condemns and denounces every crime and every evil. We are advocates for peace. We believe in peace. This high-level delegation of Muslim scholars from different countries and from different sects has come to say that our religion is one of peace, one of mercy and one which fights evil,"" Sheikh al-Issa said at the time.

In her first State of the European Union address, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen denounced the growing trend of antisemitism and hatred across Europe, saying hate is hate and no one should have to put up with it.
In her remarks, President Leyen referenced the antisemitic Aalst Carnival, rhetorically asking, where is the essence of humanity when antisemitic carnival costumes openly parade on our streets?
Where is the essence of humanity when every single day Roma people are excluded from society and others are held back simply because of the color of their skin or their religious belief?
President Leyen also announced that the European Commission will release a plan to combat racism. The plan will strengthen racial equality laws, extend the list of EU-level crimes to include all forms of hate crime and hate speech, as well as create the position of an anti-racism coordinator.
President Leyens remarks came shortly after the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) published a new report covering the current state of antisemitism. The report stated that European Union Member States are not bound to report or track antisemitic incidents, making it difficult to have a full understanding of the state of antisemitism and to form a cohesive national response to it.
The World Jewish Congress has worked closely with the European Commission to combat antisemitism in Europe. Most recently WJC partnered with the European Commission, UNESCO and Twitter to launch the #ThinkBeforeSharing campaign.

DAVID BROWN, CHICAGO POLICE SUPERINTENDENT: Visualize the seven-year-old child leading to death while the family is there.
FINN: Also, among the innocent victims, police say 14-year-old Vernado Jones was shot and killed by gang members on the Fourth of July.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If black lives don't matter to us, how the hell is it supposed to matter to anybody else? (INAUDIBLE)
FINN: Chicago police say nearly 90 people were shot since the beginning of the long weekend on Thursday. 17 people were killed even though 1,200 additional officers were added to the streets for the holiday.
Today, Chicago's police Superintendent David Brown says there's, quote, no consequences for illegal gun possession in Chicago. He's demanding stricter sentences and is publicly criticizing the, quote, decision-makers who he says are releasing repeat violent offenders.
BROWN: And many of these people come right back to the very communities where they committed their crimes, to commit more crimes.
FINN: In New York, at least eight people were killed and 44 shot over the weekend after what was reportedly the cities bloodiest June in 24 years.
NYPD's former commissioner is blasting Mayor Bill de Blasio calling him atrocious for eliminating the Anti-Crime Unit along with the cities billion dollar cut to the Police Department.
RAY KELLY, FORMER COMMISSIONER, NYPD: We have de Blasio here for another 18 months and that's very, very discouraging.

KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS (D), MAYOR OF ATLANTA: You can't blame this on the police officer, you can't say that we -- this is about criminal justice reform. This is about some people carrying some weapons who shot up a car with an 8-year old baby in the car, for what?
(END VIDEOTAPE)
FINN: New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has responded to some of the weekend violence there saying it's directly related in part to people being cooped up during the pandemic, Bret.
BAIER: Matt Finn live in Chicago. Matt, thanks.
The Trump administration pushing back hard on the weekend violence. Correspondent Kristin Fisher is at the White House tonight with that part of the story.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Government is ready willing unable to intervene in New York and Chicago after this weekend's deadly shootings. The White House press secretary says she was dismayed she wasn't asked about the violence during today's briefing.
KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I didn't receive one question about five children who are killed.
FISHER: Instead, questions centered around the president's tweet this morning asking if NASCAR's only black driver Bubba Wallace has apologized after the FBI determined he was not the target of a hate crime. Even though Wallace was not the one who found the rope in his garage nor did he report it.
The president tweeted, that and NASCAR's decision to ban the Confederate flag has caused the lowest ratings ever. Wallace responded this afternoon by saying, love over hate every day even when it's hate from the president.
The controversy caps a weekend of President Trump decrying what he describes as a left-wing cultural revolution.
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Our nation is what they're saying a merciless campaign to wipe out our history, defame our heroes, erase our values and indoctrinate our children.
FISHER: Democrats including two women in the running to be Joe Biden's running mate are slamming his speech in the shadow of Mount Rushmore and his follow-up at the White House on July 4th.
SUSAN RICE, FORMER UNITED STATES NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: The president decided that he was going to stake his legacy and his campaign on preserving Confederate monuments and the relics of slavery rather than uniting this country at a time when we needed it so badly.
SEN. TAMMY DUCKWORTH (D-IL): His priorities are all wrong here, he should be talking about what we're going to do to overcome this pandemic.
FISHER: As coronavirus hospitalization surge across the Sun Belt, President Trump is telling Americans that all but one percent of people who contract the virus will experience no severe symptoms.
TRUMP: We have tested almost 40 million people. By so doing, we show cases, 99 percent of which are totally harmless.
FISHER: It's a claim that was backed up today by White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. But the president's former commissioner of the Food Drug Administration Scott Gottlieb says he doesn't know where the president got those numbers.
DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB, FORMER COMMISSIONER, FOOD DRUG ADMINISTRATION: Certainly, more than one percent of people get serious illness from this.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
FISHER: Now, the Trump campaign is pressing ahead with more rallies. The next one is going to be this Saturday in New Hampshire. But unlike the last rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, this one is going to be outdoors, and face masks are going to be encouraged but not required, Bret.
BAIER: Kristin Fisher live in the North Lawn. Kristin, thanks.
Multiple defense sources tell Fox the military services have agreed unanimously to recommend barring the display of the Confederate flag on basis, ships, and in public spaces such as barracks.
The decision now rests with Defense Secretary Mark Esper. Last month, he requested recommendations from the service chiefs about racial issues in the ranks.
Let's talk more about what we saw and heard over the weekend starting with President Trump's Mount Rushmore speech and the reaction to it. Senior political analyst Brit Hume joins us tonight. Good evening, Brit.
BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Hi, Bret.
BAIER: You know, some of the coverage of this was pretty striking and here's the Washington Post headline, Trump's Mount Rushmore speech showed why our battle over history is so fraught. The New York Times, at Mount Rushmore and the White House, Trump updates American carnage message for 2020. And here is more of what Senator Tammy Duckworth said.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DUCKWORTH: He spent more time worried about honoring dead Confederates than he did talking about the lives of our American -- 130,000 Americans who lost their lives to COVID-19.
His priorities are all wrong here. What are we going to push pressure back? And instead, he had no time for that. He spend all his time talking about dead traitors.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BAIER: Brit, your thoughts?
HUME: Well, first thing is, Bret, President Trump never mentioned any dead Confederates. His speech in his bulk was a ringing of full-throated defense of America's history and heroes. And there were no Confederates mentioned. It was all the -- you know, the forefathers of our country. (INAUDIBLE) Lincoln and other great Americans, and that was really the main bulk of it. So what she said is flat out false.
And those headlines you mentioned from those newspapers were unbelievable misleading. And some of the other headlines that I saw were even worse than those.
In fact, as I follow this over the weekend, I don't think I've ever seen such dishonest and biased coverage of any event. This was a speech meant to be inspiring and even -- and even if you think his -- the messenger was flawed, the speech itself was quite strong and in some ways very positive, remarkable.
BAIER: In your -- in your estimation, is this all about kind of the Trump - - through the prism of Trump, or is it this moment? Where do you think this is coming from?
HUME: Well, we are in a bitterly divided country. When people have decided what they think of Trump and those who don't like him, I don't think they pay much attention to what he actually says and even less to what he actually does. And the result is that he gets the kind of coverage he gets.
I thought as I saw this weekend unfold in the coverage the way it was, knowing that many Americans will have seen this speech or heard it or even read it and will know the truth about it that this whole issue provides an opening for the president politically, especially since with crime in the streets soaring with all this violence and looting and so on. That Joe Biden has come out and said that he wants to transform America which is basically the same message you're getting from the hard left. They want to transform America too.
And yet, and then he comes out today and uses a tweet to pick a fight with Bubba Wallace who's been out of the news for more than a week. I can't imagine why he did that. He was on a subject that might help him and then he changes the subject. Hard to imagine.
BAIER: Yes, the tweet at the end of it, he talks about the Confederate flag, the decision for NASCAR to kind of ban it from its events and the ratings for NASCAR. The White House took a lot of questions about that today.
HUME: Yes, Bret, and why would you even want to talk about the Confederate flag, that's not a presidential issue. You know, our nation's history and heroes, that's at where the presidential topic. And he had a speech that was -- that was worthy of that and then he gets into this. It's just -- you know, it's an unforced error in my opinion politically when he had a clear opening.
And you know, Joe Biden had made the opening even wider.
BAIER: Brit, as always --
HUME: -- hard to believe the things the president does.
BAIER: As always, thank you.
A big ruling tonight from the U.S. Supreme Court that could have huge ramifications for this November presidential election. Fox News chief legal correspondent, anchor at ""FOX NEWS NIGHT"" Shannon Bream has details tonight. Good evening, Shannon.
SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Good evening, Bret. Well, this has to do with the Electoral College which is of course how we actually choose the president and what the court decided today could make all the difference in who becomes president in our future elections.
The current case stems from 2016, when 10 people chosen to represent their states in the Electoral College decided, well, they wanted to go rogue and vote how they chose instead of following their states' popular votes.
Will that number would actually be enough to change the results of five previous presidential elections? And that possibility was something the justices seemed to be keenly aware of when they heard the case in May.
Any unanimous opinion today, the Supreme Court held that states can punish or remove electors who do not stick to their pledge to vote in line with their state's popular vote.
Writing for the 90 court today, Justice Kagan said this, quote, the constitution's text, and the nation's history both support allowing a state to enforce an elector's pledge to support his party's nominee and the state voters' choice for president.
Now, based on what I heard during the oral arguments back in May with the justices openly worrying about the possibility of electors being bribed and the country throwing into chaos, not too surprising of a result today, Bret.
BAIER: Shannon, the court also tackled something most Americans can definitely agree on, those dreaded robocalls.
BREAM: Yes, there are things that unite us. Today, the court upheld a federal law that bans those calls from going to your cell phone. Running for the majority Justice Kavanaugh spoke for all of us saying this, quote, Americans passionately disagree about many things, but they are largely united in their disdain for robocalls.
So, in 2015, there was actually a change to the law and there was this exception that would allow for robocalls tied to efforts to collect debts owed to the government.
Today, that was severed out from the law, the overall law, and that part of it was struck down. So the federal ban on robocalls to cell phones, that remains in place. It will now include collection calls related to government debt.
Tonight, as it stands, we are still awaiting five big cases from the Supreme Court before it wraps its term. They do include two companion cases about whether House committees and or a state prosecutor in New York can get access to the president's financial records and tax returns. We do expect we'll probably get those decisions sometime this week, Bret.
BAIER: OK. Thanks, Shannon.
In tonight's Democracy 2020 report, Joe Biden is promising as you heard from Brit Hume to quote, transform the nation if he's elected in November. But the presumptive Democratic presidential nominees not exactly saying what that means.
Correspondent Peter Doocy has tonight's report.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Biden means big changes, tweeting, we're going to beat Donald Trump. And when we do, we won't just rebuild this nation, we'll transform it. Transform it into what though?
Donald Trump Jr. Speculates Biden wants to transform America to CHOP, the shorthand for the police-free Capitol Hill Organized Protest in Seattle.
But the Trump campaign is zeroing in on a different Biden comment asking why he didn't express more pride in America in this Fourth of July message.
JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: American history is no fairy tale. It's been a constant push and pull between the two parts of our character. The idea that all men and women, all people are created equal and the racism that has torn us apart.
DOOCY: American history is also now front and center in the Biden veepstakes which the Washington Post reports includes a new focus on Senator Tammy Duckworth.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: In your view, where does it end? Should statues for example of George Washington come down?
DUCKWORTH: Well, let me just say that we should start off by having a national dialogue on it at some point.
DOOCY: Susan Rice is also reportedly on the short-list.
RICE: I'm going to do everything I can to help get Joe Biden elected and to help him succeed as president. Whether I'm his running mate or I'm a doorknocker.
DOOCY: But is the race now, Biden v. Trump v. Kanye West? The rapper tweets, ""We must now realize the promise of America by trusting God, unifying our vision, and building our future. I am running for president of the United States. #2020VISION.""
But, it's too late to get on the ballot as an Independent in six states, including New York and Texas.
KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: This is Kanye, thinking that sending out a tweet this the same as getting on the ballot and setting up a campaign. It is just a laughable fantasy. I mean, it's just a joke.
DOOCY: If West isn't joking, then, he's had a change of heart.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just a future presidential candidate?
TRUMP: Could very well be.
KANYE WEST, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Only after --
(CROSSTALK)
TRUMP: That's good. I'm glad to hear that.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
DOOCY: So, Kanye faces long odds. After all, how could a billionaire with no experience in politics, who up until recently was on a reality T.V. show ever win? Bret?
BAIER: Peter, thanks.
It was big day for text stocks and the Dow surged 460. The S&P 500 was up 50 today, the NASDAQ jumped 226.
Up next, the numbers continue to soar in the coronavirus pandemic. We'll look into them, the death rates as well. First, here is what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight.
Fox 9 in Boise as authorities in Idaho say, at least, eight people are dead including three children after two small planes collide over a lake. The sheriff's dive team has located the wreckage and recovered three of the victim so far.
Fox 45 in Baltimore, as pieces of a Christopher Columbus statue, are retrieved from Baltimore's inner harbor. The recovery comes two days after protesters pulled down that figure from the little Italy neighborhood and threw it into the harbor.
This is a look at San Francisco, the big story there tonight. Uber acquires food delivery company, Postmates, in a $2.65 billion all-stock deal. Uber and its Uber Eats food delivery division will gain ground against DoorDash which controls about 37 percent of the U.S. food delivery market.
That is tonight's live look ""OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY"" from SPECIAL REPORT. Put out the look that we'll be right back.
BAIER: ""BREAKING TONIGHT"", Atlanta's mayor, says she has tested positive for coronavirus. Democratic Keisha Lance Bottoms tweeted a few minutes ago, ""COVID-19 literally hit home. I've had no symptoms and have tested positive."" The mayor told reporters, she has no clue where she contracted COVID-19.
The Pentagon is deploying about 50 medical personnel from Colorado to San Antonio, Texas. They will assist local hospitals there in dealing with the spike in coronavirus cases and increased hospitalizations.
This occurs as infection number surge in several locations while the country continues to emerge from the lockdown. Correspondent Jonathan Serrie shows us here tonight from Atlanta.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: New York City went into phase three of reopening while keeping restaurant dining rooms closed.
BILL DE BLASIO, MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK: We got so much data from around the country indicating indoor dining, unfortunately, became a real nexus for infection. In a way that other types of, you know, economic activity work.
SERRIE: Mayor de Blasio is trying to spare New York a second spike in cases seen across America Sun Belt. As Florida reported a record number of cases over the holiday weekend, Miami Beach close its shoreline to prevent crowd seen in other places such as Sacramento, California's Ocean Beach.
Many who flocked to the Jersey shore ignored police from public health officials to wear face coverings.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Everyone is coming on, you can see someone we've been asked, and we also just left them.
SERRIE: Nationwide average daily cases have increased 134 percent over the past month. Deaths during the same period actually decrease to 39 percent. Perhaps, in part, because the new spike is affecting many younger healthier patients.
But because fatalities can occur more than a week after hospitalization, deaths usually lag as an indicator.
DR. ASHISH JHA, FACULTY DIRECTOR, HARVARD GLOBAL HEALTH INSTITUTE: One is we are seeing increases in hospitalizations, so I worried that we are going to be seeing increase in deaths.
Second is we're getting better at treating the disease. So, we may have somebody who spends two or three weeks in the ICU and walks out. There's still going to be pretty sick with a lot of suffering, but they're less likely to die.
SERRIE: While six feet remains the gold standard for social distancing, more than 200 international scientists are calling on the World Health Organization to revise its recommendations. Pointing to evidence the virus can remain infectious in smaller airborne particles that travel further distances.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
SERRIE: The issue of airborne transmission sparked debates as early on in the pandemic. The six-foot rule may follow the same pattern as face coverings, while this mask cannot 100 percent guarantee you won't become infected, study suggests they significantly reduce the risks. Bret.
BAIER: Jonathan Serrie in Atlanta. Jonathan, thank you.

Just some of the other stories ""BEYOND OUR BORDERS"" tonight. We'll be right back.
BAIER: Major setback tonight for the oil industry and the Trump administration, and a big win for Native Americans in one region.
A federal judge has ordered a temporary shutdown for one of the major oil pipelines in this country. Correspondent David Spunt, tells us tonight that fight may not be over.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: In a blow to the Trump administration, the Dakota Access pipeline must empty and completely shut down by August 5th.
Federal Judge James Boasberg, nixed a permit needed by the Army Corps of Engineers to move forward with the controversial pipeline. Writing in part, ""The Corps had failed to produce an environmental impact statement despite conditions that triggered such a requirement.""
Four days into his term, President Trump pushed through construction despite objections from environmental activists and Native American tribes.
TRUMP: We'll see if we can get that pipeline built. A lot of jobs.
SPUNT: But protests date back to 2014 when officials announced the nearly $4 billion project to the public. One of the tribes objecting, the Standing Rock Sioux.
WINONA LADUKE, ENVIRONMENTALIST: This pipeline represents not only a slap on the face but basically a declaration of war against the five Ojibwe tribes, who have intervened in this process.
SPUNT: Those opposing the pipeline are worried about spills and other safety hazards. Today's ruling comes just one day after Duke and Dominion Energy announced they will scrap plans for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, citing delays and uncertainty. Another setback for a White House focused on increased U.S.-based oil production.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
SPUNT: Judge Boasberg, an Obama appointee, has shut down the pipeline pending an environmental review. Justice Department attorneys could quickly seek temporary legal relief at the court of appeals, or the Supreme Court behind me. Bret?
BAIER: David Spunt at the Supreme Court. David, thanks.
There is a push here in Washington to rename the city's NFL teams. It's been around for a while, but now it seems to gaining steam, and the person in charge is indicating he will at least consider it. FOX Business correspondent Hillary Vaughn reports tonight from Landover, Maryland.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder once promised never to cave to political pressure to ditch their terms ""Redskins"" in his team's name. But today, things are different. Rebranding the Washington team might not come down to politics but dollars and cents.
SHANNON SHARPE, FORMER NFL PLAYER: Now they're starting to hit Daniel Snyder where it would potentially hurt, and that's in the back pocket.
VAUGHN: But the cost of not doing anything could be even greater if the team's corporate sponsors walk away, like PepsiCo, Bank of America, Nike, and FedEx, who all support the name change after facing pressure from investment firms and shareholders. The controversy has team ownership shaken up, too. ""The Washington Post"" reports that three minority owners, including FedEx CEO Fred Smith, are looking to sell their stakes in the NFL franchise. Redskins coach Ron Rivera says the team could head into the 2020 season with a new name.
A total makeover of the $3.4 billion organization with new merchandise, signage, training facilities, and a branded stadium could cost up to $10 million and could take up to six months according to one estimate from brand consultant Landor Associates. The team's quarterback Dwayne Haskins likes the Washington Red Tails to honored the Tuskegee Airmen instead of Redskins, but fans need to get on board.
MARTY CONWAY, SPORTS MARKETING EXPERT: In terms of profitability, it's local revenues, it's tickets, it's merchandise, it's things that are bought on premise at the stadium that could really make a difference between profit and loss. And so I do think that there is some risk of alienation of perhaps longstanding fans.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
VAUGHN: Bret, the blowback now has some retailers bailing. Nike and Walmart are pulling Redskins gear out of their online inventory. Target says they're in the process of pulling merchandise off their store shelves, too. Bret?
BAIER: Hillary Vaughn outside the stadium, Hillary, thanks.
Up next, the panel on the increasing numbers, the new cases, hospitalizations, and the rates of the coronavirus.
First, country music loses a major star with the death of Charlie Daniels. Today his publicist reported that doctors say the singer had a stroke. Daniel's big hit, ""The Devil Went Down to Georgia."" Charlie Daniels was 83.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Our nation is witnessing a merciless campaign to wipe out our history, defame our heroes, erase our values, and indoctrinate our children.
Angry mobs are trying to tear down statues of our founders, deface our most sacred memorials, and unleash a wave of violent crime in our cities.
SEN. TAMMY DUCKWORTH, (D-IL): What really struck me about the speech that the president gave at Mount Rushmore was that he spent more time worried about honoring dead Confederates then he done talking about the lives of our 130,000 American who lost their lives to COVID-19.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BAIER: Again, talking about the Mount Rushmore speech, and as Brit, mentioned earlier, the president didn't talk about dead Confederates in that speech, but it did get a lot of attention.
Meantime, Gallup is out with a new poll on the president's job approval. You can see it's 38 percent, down from a high of 49 percent in early May in this particular poll. And then if you split it by party, it's noticeable. Republicans up six-point since the end of May, 91 percent, Democrats down three, 89-point gap there between Republicans and Democrats. And independents down six points since May. That's Gallup.
Let's bring in our panel, Charles Lane, opinion writer for ""The Washington Post,"" Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at ""The Federalist,"" and Chris Stirewalt, politics editor here at FOX News. Mollie, your take on the weekend and the reaction to it?
MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, ""THE FEDERALIST"": On Friday President Trump gave a speech that I think a lot of Americans were desperate to hear someone give, a bold defense of America and her founding principles of our heroes, of how we have improved over time. It was something that had been noticeably lacking in our discourse from a lot of political leaders.
And what was also significant about the speech, I think -- it was importance for a campaign message, too, for the president. This is the type of message that will really resonate with a lot of people who are so upset by seeing what's happening in the streets, cities nationwide with violent riots and protests, and nobody s standing up for America or her heroes.
It was also significant, I think, that the media responded to the speech so negatively. Not with any facts and not with any news writings, but with unbridled opinion writing, and rewriting what he said, claiming that he was talking about confederates or that when he was racist when he explicitly condemned racism, and when he explicitly mentioned people, none of whom who had anything to do with the Confederacy. And so seeing the media resort to just straight out lying I think shows something about what they will be willing to do to advance their political aims this campaign season as well.
BAIER: Earlier, Chris, Brit Hume said that roughly the same message there from Mollie, but then we had this morning the president tweeting out about Bubba Wallace, saying, the NASCAR driver, the only African-American NASCAR driver, has he ""apologized to all the great NASCAR drivers and officials who came to his aid, stood by his side, and were willing to sacrifice everything for him, only to find out the whole thing was just another hoax. That and flag decision has caused lowest ratings every.""
Here's the White House press secretary answering a lot of questions about that, and Senator Lindsey Graham.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: He said he was not making a judgment one way or the other. The intent of the tweet was to stand up for the men and women of NASCAR and the fans and those who have gone in this rush to judgment of the media to call something a hate crime when in fact the FBI report concluded this was not an intentional racist act.
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, (R-SC) SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE: I don't think Bubba Wallace has anything to apologize for. They're trying to grow the sport. And I've lived in South Carolina all my life, and if you're in business, the Confederate flag is not a good way to grow your business.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BAIER: I guess after Friday and Saturday and those speeches then today, obviously this sucked up a lot oxygen, Chris.
CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS POLITICAL EDITOR: Well, yes, and it was stepping on his own line. After ""The Wall Street Journal"" and other respected outlets came forward and said good speech, Mr. President, you took on something people care about, all of those things. It's not about race, and all that stuff. Then he comes out and he says that NASCAR should allow the Confederate flag to be flown and its races and they were wrong to do it. So nobody steps on his own lines like he does.
But here's the thing that I kept coming back to through that speech, through the Fourth of July remarks, all of that stuff. I was reminded of his convention speech in 2016, of his inaugural address. What missed opportunities to talk to persuadable voters. Those independent voters that you referenced, they're now down to 33 percent with independents. Nobody is getting elected president with 33 percent support from independents. And when Trump has the opportunity to talk about a big unifying message, he chooses to go the other way and cater to his base.
BAIER: Chuck?
CHARLES LANE, OPINION WRITER, ""WASHINGTON POST"": I agree with Chris. I think what's very characteristic of the president to read one message from a teleprompter and then provide a different message when he's speaking spontaneously on Twitter, when you think about this Confederate flag thing, we live in a world where Mississippi, the state of Mississippi, has voted to remove the Confederate flag from its state symbol. And here is the president actually voicing some residual sympathy for the Confederate flag, which is such an inflammatory symbol of treason and white supremacy.
So I think there's a level of which -- with all due respect to Mollie, we don't have to necessarily take at face value this unifying message that he is trying to put out. And by the way, he threw in the term leftwing fascism, I think, as well, which was pretty inflammatory and polarizing on his part.
BAIER: Mollie?
HEMINGWAY: I think what people are missing is that there has been a lot of divisiveness in the country. And it is not coming not from a speech that calls on everybody to adhere to American values, but from some of this weaponization of political correctness that we have seen not just in the streets, but in corporations, in people's workplaces. That's what a lot of people find divisive, that they aren't free to speak their mind without facing horrible consequences if they don't have the right groupthink that is adhered to by corporations.
This is something that I think a lot of people are desperate for people to push back against. And it's not divisive to appeal to American ideals. If it is divisive, I think that signifies what a big problem we have, and also how people will be thinking about this in the election.
BAIER: Go ahead, Chuck.
LANE: I think it's divisive to call people on the other side fascists.
HEMINGWAY: It's very divisive to make people not be able to have jobs if they don't adhere to certain groupthink or to not have a position where they can express their ideas. These are things that real Americans are dealing with, not people like you or me, but all sorts of Americans who are just facing this in their workplaces, in their schools. And it's something that a lot of American leaders haven't been addressing and more people should.
BAIER: Meantime, Chris, there are 20 states now pausing or reversing or delaying reopening plans, and it goes really across the map, a lot in the south and west and obviously Florida, as we see there. The coronavirus and how it's handled is going to be a big part of whatever happens in November.
STIREWALT: It doesn't matter which monuments go up or which monuments come down. What will determine this election almost invariably will be whether or not the president is perceived as having done a good job with coronavirus and, by extension, economic recovery. The two are inseparable. And right now he's failing on both questions.
People do still think Trump can do a good job on the economy. That's the place that he can go. But he keeps going over to these wedge issues. He hangs out in these wedge issues, satisfying voters who are already satisfied by him. It is inexplicable. I cannot explain it. It is political malpractice almost, but that's what he and the campaign seem devoted to.
BAIER: But Chuck, if the economy, there are some indications that it is starting to take off in some places. If it does bounce back in the next few months, does that somehow open the door that doesn't seem open right now?
LANE: It could, definitely could. And there certainly are green shoots to be seen, although, as you say, the bad news on the coronavirus kind of mitigates that. But that makes it all the more mysterious, Bret, that so for he's not articulating any forward-looking or positive message about economic issue. That is where the voters are still giving him the benefit of the doubt and some support, and yet there's this whole issue of Congress, hanging over Congress right now what kind of a bill they should put out, and he's doing essentially nothing except occasionally making a few offhand comments about things he'd like to see in the bill. He's not messaging on that, he's not pushing on that. It's very strange.
BAIER: We'll see where it goes. Next up, Joe Biden stays off the road, his virtual campaign continues. We'll bring you that side.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The 56 signers of our Declaration of Independence pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to boldly proclaim this eternal truth, that we are all made equal by God.
JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We hold these truths to be self- evident, that all men are created equal. Never lived up to it. Jefferson himself didn't. He held slaves. Women were excluded. But once proposed, it was an idea that couldn't be constrained.

BAIER: Two messages on the Fourth of July from President Trump and former vice president Joe Biden. This as new polls out in some of the battleground states, the average of polls, you can see that Joe Biden is up seven in Michigan, six in Pennsylvania, six in Wisconsin. These are the average of recent polls, even North Carolina, and we'll see where those stand as you get closer to the election.
Back with the panel. Mollie, contrasting messages, obviously, on the Fourth of July. Joe Biden's choice to talk about that America has never lived up to her ideals.
HEMINGWAY: Yes, it is a noticeable difference between these candidates, and I think it speaks to larger issues that they're dealing with as they try to put together coalitions to victory. Joe Biden doesn't have much of a positive case for his election, except insofar, as he himself has said, he will bring in this new left, he will work to further transform the country along the lines of progressive ideals.
I don't think people really think he's got it in him to do it, which is why I think people are so interested in who his vice presidential candidate will be, but also because they understand he almost serves as a Trojan horse or some means by which what the party really wants to accomplish will accomplish. I don't think they have the highest hopes that it will be through Joe Biden, but he is still speaking to that progressive left in his remarks.
BAIER: Transform the nation, Chris. He has a little bit of leeway with the middle here. If we talked in the last segment about Donald Trump losing some independents according to the polls and maybe disaffected Republicans or conservative Democrats, but Biden has his own issues with the progressive left, as Mollie is talking about.
STIREWALT: Well, I tell you what, Joe Biden talking about we're going to transform the country would be about like me I was going to run the New York Marathon. It is not supported by facts and evidence.
(LAUGHTER)
BAIER: I've seen you run. I mean, 26 miles, maybe not.
STIREWALT: Only when chased.
(LAUGHTER)
STIREWALT: Only when chased, Bret Baier.
The reality here is Biden needs -- as Mollie says, he needs to build out some sort of positive, affirmative case for what his administration would be like, other than calm. He wants everyone to know that it would be very calm and that he would be a caretaker. Then he throws out this banana peel for himself. We will transform the country. From what to what, Mr. Vice President? What the heck are you talking about here?
So I think Trump is letting Biden have his way right now because Trump isn't competing among persuadable voters. That keeps the pressure off Biden to the left. If Trump every figures out some way to talk to the middle, Biden is going to be in trouble because it will make those base voters, those liberal activist voters more valuable. Right now, he can blow them off pretty well except for a weirdo tweet on a weekend.
BAIER: Chuck, the substance debate usually starts after we get to September, which is, what does your tax plan look like? What do regulations look like? You've been in Washington for 43 years. I assume that's coming from the Trump campaign, but right now it's not there.
LANE: No. As I mentioned before, he's very, very light on a forward-looking message for his second term. And as you all know from the buzz around town, a lot of his advisors are concerned about trying to put something out like that. I suppose in political terms you could say the Rushmore speech and stuff like that is what you do when you're shoring up your base before you move to the center. We'll have to see if that actually happens.
As for Biden, I've got to say, he's done a pretty -- I don't see a lot of pressure on him, actually. He's doing terrific in the polls just doing what he's doing because right now the election shapes up as a referendum on the incumbent, and the incumbent is presiding over double digit unemployment and a pandemic and all kinds of strife in the streets. And you would think that the challenger in a situation like that would have the upper hand, and he does.
BAIER: All right, Kanye West, Mollie, he's in, he says. What do you think?
HEMINGWAY: I'm just intrigued to hear more about why he's in. People run for president for a variety of reasons. I'm not sure how serious it is, but assuming that it is, he might have a message he wants to share, I just didn't get enough of it this weekend. But I'm intrigued to hear more.
BAIER: We're all intrigued. Panel, thank you very much.
When we come back, the brighter side, some good news.
BAIER: Finally tonight, after a patriotic weekend, some patriotic performances.

BAIER: Three-year-old Amelia Day showed off her Independence Day spirit with her own versions of some patriotic tunes. She performed several different songs against the backdrop of Yellowstone National Park before the weekend celebrations. Nice job.
Violinist Polly Launay was visiting family in Illinois for the Fourth of July weekend when she decided to record a patriotic tribute, and she teamed up with her family's Boston terrier, as you can hear, to perform a rendition of ""The Star-Spangled Banner.""
