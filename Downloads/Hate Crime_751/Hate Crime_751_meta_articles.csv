1. Daniel Finkelstein in The Times
on balancing the economy with health
 ""At the root of the Covid-19 problem is a simple choice: the crisis won't pass until we either have a successful treatment or vaccine, or natural herd immunity so that if someone gets it they can't really pass it on because such a large proportion of the population are immune. We must choose. We can allow the virus to spread, aiming to achieve herd immunity as quickly as possible. Or we can try to hold it off until we get a vaccine or treatment. The choice may be simple but that doesn't make it an easy one. We can't know for certain when an adequate treatment or a vaccine will be available. If we hang on for science to rescue us, holding back the economy and social life, we can't be sure the cavalry will ever arrive. And at some point we will have to give up and allow natural herd immunity to develop after all, with all the deaths that involves, meaning that much of the effort and sacrifice we made was in vain. Nevertheless, I believe this risk - putting much of our economic and social lives on hold - is still the right one to take.""
2. Julian Baggini in The Guardian
on an old conservative trick
""When freedom simply means the absence of the state, there are always trade-offs between liberty and security, individual freedom and public health. But when we also think of the freedom to eat, to work, to have an education, to determine your own future, the only trade-offs are between different kinds of freedom, or the freedoms of different groups of people. Make people freer to mingle and you decrease the real freedom of the old and vulnerable to live their lives in safety. Give businesses the right to demand their employees go back to their workplaces and you increase their freedom to trade but not the freedom of employees to protect themselves and their families. Withdraw state support for the furlough scheme and you may cut people free from the ties of government but leave them penniless and powerless.""
3. Jonathan Portes, professor of economics and public policy at King's College, London in The Independent
on an oncoming crisis
""Will Covid-19 mean that we don't notice a no-deal Brexit? The continuing effects of the pandemic may mitigate or obscure - politically or economically - the impact of no deal. Whatever the headline growth figures in early 2021, it will be very difficult to attribute economic outcomes to Brexit. However, assuming a reasonably strong recovery, and that government policies succeed in avoiding persistent mass unemployment, Brexit is likely to have a more significant impact in the long run. Our modelling with the London School of Economics of the impact of a no-deal Brexit suggests that the total cost to the UK economy over the longer term will be two to three times as large as that implied by the Bank of England's forecast for the impact of Covid-19. No deal will result in immediate and substantial tariff and non-tariff barriers on UK exports to the EU. And the UK will apply the new UK Global Tariff to imports from the EU and other countries with which it does not have a trade deal. Free movement will also come to an end.""
4. Stella Creasy, Labour MP for Walthamstow, in The Daily Telegraph
on tackling crime against women
""Recognising misogyny as a driver of crime doesn't create any new crimes or criminalise anything that isn't already an offence - but it does change the seriousness with which it is treated and so addressed. As the Met Police says of other forms of hate crime: 'If it happens to you, you might be tempted to shrug it off. But if you report the hate crime, we can investigate and stop it from getting worse - either for you or someone else.' With reports during lockdown of sexual harassment and domestic violence soaring there has never been a more important time to change our approach to the abuse women face. This isn't just about a change in the criminal justice system. As with other forms of hate crime, it sends a message about the kind of society we want to live in and how to ensure everyone is free to be who they are. Overlooking the harm done by hostility based on sex creates a culture in which crimes involving violence and the abuse of women can flourish. Misogyny is so ingrained that we discount, rather than counter, it - telling women how to keep themselves safe rather than those responsible that they will be held accountable.""
5. Frank Bruni in The New York Times
on appointing politicised judges
""It was almost inevitable that President Trump would get one Supreme Court appointment during this four-year term. It was always possible that he'd get two. But three? Seldom has a president's impact been so inversely proportional to his warrant. Trump, with his nonexistent mandate, reaches extra far and wreaks extra damage. That's what makes his reign so perverse. That's the special hell of it. Almost instantly after the news of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death, I checked how many Supreme Court justices Trump's immediate predecessors had appointed, because I knew how fast he and Mitch McConnell would move to fill her seat. When it comes to this sort of unabashed power grab, they're conjoined twins, connected by their contempt for fools who get hung up on hypocrisy and prattle about fairness."" "

President's Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice Holds Hearing on Policing Culture and Community Engagement
This week, the President's Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice continued its series of hearings on community engagement, with testimony from faith leaders, and held a hearing on policing culture. The hearings were conducted via teleconference and featured expert witnesses who provided testimony and answered questions from the commissioners.
On Tuesday, June 23, 2020, the commission received testimony from Robin Engel, Ph.D., Professor, University of Cincinnati; Michael Ranalli, Chief (Retired), Glenville, New York, Police Department; Hampton (Virginia) Police Chief Terry Sult; and Springboro (Ohio) Police Chief Jeff Kruithoff.
The panelists discussed policing culture and reasonable use of force. An overarching theme throughout the panel was the need to use evidence-based research to inform successful reforms regarding police use of force.
On Wednesday, June 24, 2020, the commission received testimony from Sheriff James McDonell (retired), Los Angeles (Calif.) County; Ronal Serpas, Superintendent of Police of the New Orleans Police Department (retired) and Professor with the Loyola University New Orleans Criminal Justice Department; Chief Robert White (retired), Denver Police Department; and Sheriff Mike Chitwood, Volusia (Fla.) County.
The panel focused on the use of force and culture change. The panelists discussed the importance of leading by example within the department, especially with regards to new officers; integrating community policing values throughout an entire academy curriculum instead of teaching it as a standalone course; acknowledging that while no single police incident represents an entire department, nothing undermines years of work developing community trust as quickly as incidents where police use unnecessary or excessive force; and learning from the successes of other departments and agencies.
On Thursday, June 25, 2020, the commission received testimony from Jeff Ballabon, CEO B2 Strategic, Washington, DC; Rabbi Jack Moline, Executive Director, Interfaith Alliance, Washington DC; and Imam Talib Shareef, President of Masjid Muhammad, The Nation's Mosque.
The panel focused on the relationship between religious minorities and law enforcement. The panelists discussed the importance of building relationships with law enforcement at a community level in order to change dynamics; the need for law enforcement to take steps at every level to investigate and prevent hate-based crime, as well as hold officers accountable for engaging in racial or religious profiling, targeting, and surveillance; and the value of breaking stereotypes and ""challenging the narrative.""

The Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday on the Caution Against Racial and Exploitative Non-Emergencies Act, also known as the CAREN legislation. It's a nod to a popular meme using the name “Karen” to describe an entitled white woman whose actions stem from her privilege, such as using police to target people of color.
All 11 supervisors signed on to the legislation, guaranteeing its passage, despite criticism that the name is sexist and divisive. It comes amid a national reckoning on race sparked by the police killings of Black Americans and instances where white people called for officers to investigate people of color.
“We don’t want what happened to Emmett Till in 1955, or the long history of false accusations of black men and boys in this country, due to weaponizing law enforcement, to threaten, terrorize, and sometimes even kill them, to ever happen again,” said Supervisor Shamann Walton, who introduced the legislation and is Black.
“I really want to emphasize that 911 is not a customer service line for someone's racist behavior,"" he said.
Walton was the only supervisor to speak. Till was a Black teenager beaten to death in 1955 after accusations by a white woman who later admitted to lying.
In May, Amy Cooper, a white woman, called 911 from Manhattan’s Central Park, falsely claiming that a Black man — who had politely asked her to leash her dog — was threatening her. She has been charged with filing a false police report.
In San Francisco, a white couple was criticized on social media after video was widely shared of them questioning a Filipino American stenciling “Black Lives Matter” on a retaining wall in front of his home in June. They later called police.
James Juanillo said he chose yellow chalk to match the color of the house. When the couple approached him, they repeatedly demanded to know if it was his home because he was defacing private property.
“They tried to cast it as a criminal scene,” he said. “It was me calmly applying chalk, not spray paint, not in the middle of the night but very deliberately. The only thing that was missing was a pinot grigio.”
Supporters of the legislation say it is crushing to be confronted by police because someone saw you as a threat, possibly as a criminal or as not belonging. It's especially terrifying for Black people, whose encounters with police could end in violence.
“This is not hyperbole,"" said Brittni Chicuata, chief of staff for San Francisco's Human Rights Commission. “This is an established pattern reflected in the disparate treatment of Black people and other people of color in our city and in our country.""
Other places have moved to make placing racist 911 calls a hate crime. California's governor recently signed a measure making the crime a misdemeanor punishable by jail time and a fine. New York approved legislation allowing the victims of racist 911 calls to sue.
The San Francisco legislation gives people the right to sue a 911 caller in civil court, and supporters hope it will make some think twice before turning to police. The discrimination need not be only racial; it can also be due to the person’s sex, age, religion, disability, gender identity, weight or height.
The legislation does not spell out the standards needed to sue. But it notes that qualifying calls are those that caused the person to feel harassed or embarrassed; damaged the person’s reputation or business prospects; or forced the person from an area where they had a lawful right to be.
The board has received written complaints from eight people — several whose names have different spellings of Karen — saying they support the legislation but object to its moniker, which they call sexist and ageist.it
Vic Vicari wrote that the insensitive use of the name “as a general purpose term of disapproval for middle age white women needs to stop.” Carynn Silva said she loves the name her mom gave her and called it a racist term against white women. Caren Batides asked if the supervisor would want his name mocked.
“Yes, I am named Karen, and I do speak up for injustices on a regular occasion,” Karen Shane wrote. “So could we attempt at coming up with some other acronym that doesn’t vilify a whole group of people named Karen/Caryn/Caren?”
Reached by phone, Shane, who lives in a San Francisco Bay Area suburb and describes herself as a middle-aged white woman, readily pokes fun at her first name and said she’s aware that even complaining about it is something that a “Karen” would do. But she feels the supervisor didn’t need to cheapen what she agrees is important legislation.
“By using the name CAREN, he’s just perpetuating a racial divide,"" she said. “Granted it’s not a protected class, but it’s somebody’s name.”
Walton has dismissed the concerns, saying the legislation does not refer to any individual."

The law, supported by both Republicans and Democrats in Congress, was a milestone in American history. But now another moment could risk complicating years of progress for Asian Americans: The coronavirus pandemic. 
People in countries including South Korea, Malaysia, the U.K. and Canada are reporting the spread of anti-Chinese racism, attacks on the country's cultural mores and businesses with signs saying, 'No Chinese.' The U.S., it seems, is not immune[1]. Almost 40% of people said it has become more common for people to express racist views toward Asians since the pandemic began, according to a Pew Research Center survey [2]with a 9,654-person sample size. ' 'As I was walking, I heard a lady who was shouting at me, accusing me I have brought the virus.' ' — Dorothea Gloria, a 28-year-old actress living in New York City There have been more than 2,100 anti-Asian American hate incidents related to COVID-19 across the country, only between March and June, according to the database [3]of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council and Chinese for Affirmative Action, a coalition of community-based organizations that advocates for the rights and needs of the Asian and Pacific Islander American community. 'One day, I was walking down the street in Astoria, on my way to the bank. As I was walking, I heard a lady who was shouting at me, accusing me I have brought the virus,' said Dorothea Gloria, a 28-year-old actress living in Queens, N.Y. who is from Manila, in the Philippines. Like so many other artists, Gloria moved to the U.S. four years ago, chasing her dreams in a multi-cultural environment like New York City. Since the pandemic has started, however, she perceived a shift in people's behaviors on the street. The episode that day proved it. 'It was along the lines of, 'Chinese bitch! You brought the virus here, you bitch!' Before she could get closer to me, I walked faster away from her. While she still kept aggressively shouting at me, I was in so much fear that I started running. It was the first time I have ever felt like someone wanted to hurt me just because of the way I look,' she said. Dorothea Gloria: 'It was the first time I have ever felt like someone wanted to hurt me just because of the way I look.' Courtesy Dorothea Gloria Gloria is not the only discrimination victim in the United States. Nearly a third of Asian Americans (31%) say they have been subject to racist slurs or jokes, while 26% say feared someone might physically attack them, the Pew Research Study found. The focus on Wuhan, the Central Chinese city where the virus is believed to have been first diagnosed in December, and rumors about whether it began in a food market there, have led to reports of racism against Asian Americans and the sharing of xenophobic memes online. ' 'Since February, I had the feeling I was the person no one wanted to have around.' ' — Kiana Wu, a 23-year-old Taiwanese-Canadian, living in New York 'Since February, I had the feeling I was the person no one wanted to have around,' said Kiana Wu, a 23-year-old Taiwanese-Canadian, who has lived in New York for three years until last March. She felt under a microscope for the duration of the flight. 'I remembered I was walking on the aisle of the plane during a flight from Florida to New York, and people were looking at me scared,' Wu recalled. No one was wearing a mask in the U.S. back then, in late February, she added. 'I was not wearing a mask either, and people behaved like they were wondering, 'Where is she coming? Was she in China recently? Why is she flying with the rest of us? It was awkward.' Kiana Wu: 'I was walking on the aisle of the plane during a flight from Florida to New York, and people were looking at me scared.' Courtesy Kiana Wu Even if isolated, episodes like these could have a prolonged mental impact, according to therapists [4]and doctors. That was the case of Dorothea Gloria. 'Especially during the next few weeks after that incident, I was so paranoid to even go to the grocery,' she said. 'I even told my boyfriend, 'Hey, let's stay under the sun a bit more so I can look more Filipino.' I said this jokingly, but I think these words came from fear from that incident.' Asian Americans are among the most diverse and fast-growing communities in the United States today. Nearly 21 million Americans are Asian, according to the American Community Survey Demographic and Housing Estimates by the U.S. Census Bureau. The number of eligible voters more than doubled, growing by 139% to 7.5 million from 2000 to 2020, according to Pew. Asian Americans are, of course, a culturally rich and diverse community, and include Chinese, Indians, Japanese, Filipinos, Japanese, Koreans, Vietnamese and Bangladeshi, among many other nationalities and ethnicities. The median annual household income[5] of Asian Americans is still the highest of the country per race, with $85,897 dollars, compared to $65,902 for Caucasian Americans, $41,511 for Black Americans, and $51,404 for Latino Americans. 'What is ironic is that we have a huge percentage of Asian Americans in the hospitals helping to save people from COVID-19 right now,' said Elizabeth OuYang, a civic engagement consultant in the Asian Pacific American community. 'At the same time, we have been targeted just because of how we look.' OuYang's parents emigrated from China to the U.S. in the 1950s, and she has been a civil rights attorney for over 25 years. When 2020 began, one of her goals was to educate and advocate for Asian Americans to be part of the electoral process. ' 'My brother is a doctor on the frontline and has been targeted to unfair racial offenses.' ' — Elizabeth OuYang, a civic engagement consultant in the Asian Pacific American community. Then, the coronavirus hit the U.S. hard, and the rising number of episodes of discrimination changed part of her mission, too. 'My brother is a doctor on the frontline and has been targeted to unfair racial offenses,' pointed out OuYang, who realized something was going to change badly in the early spring. 'It was when people saw me and would think I was from China or as Chinese American. They act differently toward me.' For consultants like OuYang, she said there is one person who is not helping to quell such actions against Asian Americans: President Donald Trump. 'A lot of damage was done by the current administration to malign COVID-19 as a 'Chinese virus.' So the spike in hate crimes against those who are perceived to look Chinese, whether or not they were Chinese Americans, was and is real,' OuYang said. Up until the task force press briefing held at the White House on Feb. 29, President Trump praised [6]Chinese President Xi Jinping, for how China was handling the coronavirus crisis. But starting in March, OuYang noted, something changed. On multiple occasions, the president referred to the coronavirus as the 'Chinese virus.' And during the rally in Tulsa, Okla., on June 20, the president introduced another pejorative nickname that many professors, academics, and advocates considered as racist: [7]'Kung Flu.' 'It has more names than any disease in history. I can name it Kung Flu. I can name 19 different versions of names,' Trump has said to cheers from the crowd in Tulsa. 'After 9/11, President George W. Bush reminded the American people that the Muslim Americans were not terrorists despite the terrorist attack,' said Jerry Vattamala, Director, Democracy Program at the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, an organization that protects civil rights of Asian Americans. 'Bush's presidential tone had preserved and stemmed a further spiking of episodes of discrimination back in 2001,' he said. Vattamala thinks that the current president is fanning the flames of hatred instead. ' 'A historical moment like this, it can become dangerous for the daily lives of all the Asian-Americans, not only the Chinese population.' ' — Jerry Vattamala, Director of the Democracy Program at the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund 'A historical moment like this, it can become dangerous for the daily lives of all the Asian Americans, not only the Chinese population,' said Vattamala, whose parents moved from India to the U.S. in the 1980s. With episodes of discrimination on the rise, some Asian Americans feel they need to take some kind of action to protect themselves. Asian Americans firmly support gun control, according to the 2018 Asian American Voter Survey [8]by APIAVote and AAPI Data. Asian American voters favor stricter gun laws in the U.S. by a nearly 7-to-1 ratio, the same survey said. But the spike in acts of discrimination has changed the perspective of many Asian Americans about guns. Several media outlets have reported [9]that a large portion of Asian Americans have become customers at gun shops in the last few months. ' 'I have always been very against guns, but now I am reconsidering it. If my family is in danger for the color of its skin, I think I have the right to protect myself and themselves.' ' — Rob Chen, an advocate for the safety of Asian-Americans 'I have always been very against guns, but now I am reconsidering it,' said Rob Chen, 26, advocate for the safety of Asian Americans, from Brooklyn. 'If my family is in danger for the color of its skin, I think I have the right to protect myself and themselves.' With discrimination rising, Chen said he has changed his daily life approach: 'I am more cautious when I walk outside, and I make sure to charge my phone before I leave my apartment,' explained Chen. 'If something happens to me, people will know, and I need the proof,' he added. The day he realized Asian Americans had become a target? Last month, when a man in Brooklyn slapped an 89-year-old Asian woman in the face before lighting her clothes on fire. Speaking in Cantonese through a translator, the victim in that incident told ABC Eyewitness News [10] DIS, -0.32%[11] that she left home in Bensonhurst on the evening of July 14 when the two men approached her. After one man slapped her, she felt a sharp pain on her back and realized they'd burned her shirt. She rubbed her back against a wall to put out the flames. 'That could have been everyone's relatives,' Chen said, complaining about the lack of coverage about these episodes by the news media, and underlining the importance of education. 'People who discriminate against us, they have to understand that the Chinese government and Chinese people are two very different things,' said Chen. 'I am not the one who spreads the virus to you, even if the virus probably came from the country I am originally from.' And for people like Kiana Wu, the future is challenging. 'For decades they thought about Asian Americans as the model minority, the perfect workers,' she said. Now, many in the U.S relate Asian Americans with sickness and death, Wu said. 'It is sad, but we have to make efforts to change it.'

The other was a photo of Tong holding a rifle to commemorate the 31st anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Massacre
Fordham University determined Tong had violated school policies with bias and hate crimes that were classified as 'Threats/Intimidation'
Tong, a Chinese immigrant and Black Lives Matter supporter, wrote that both posts were made 'love for this country'
School officials enacted several penalties, including a ban from campus, school office and possible expulsion if Tong violates probation
A Fordham University student filed a lawsuit against the school after he was banned from campus over social media posts showing hiim holding an AR-15, and another about slain retired officer David Dorn.
Austin Tong, a 21-year-old rising senior at Fordham University, last month made two separate social media posts to his Instagram account. 
A letter written to Tong by the Office of the Dean of Students determined that his posts were a 'Violation of University Regulations relating to Bias and Hate Crimes' and classified as 'Threats/Intimidation.'
On June 3, Tong shared a photo of David Dorn, a 77-year-old retired captain of the St. Louis Police Department, who was shot dead by a looter while reportedly trying to protect his friend's pawn shop during a riot.
Dorn's body was found dead on a the sidewalk in front of Lee's Pawn & Jewelry after his death was streamed on Facebook Live in June. 
'Y'all a bunch of hypocrites,' wrote Tong, a Black Lives Matter supporter, venting his apparent frustrations over the lack of outrage over the killing.
Dorn's death came after George Floyd, an unarmed father-of-five, died in police custody after Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, sparking mass protests.
On June 4, Tong shared a photo of himself holding a rifle outside a home in Nassau County with the caption 'Don't tread on me. #198964 USCN.'
The second post was meant to honor the 31st anniversary of the Tienanmen Square massacre, which saw student-led pro-democracy demonstrators brutally killed by government troops in retaliation. 
He wrote in a letter that the social media posts were made out of 'love for this country.'
'The content of both posts are fully by my love for this country, fully within the boundaries of law and university code, and in no way expressing threatening or hateful thoughts - yet the University subjectively and maliciously assumed my intentions as hate crime and threat,' he said. 
Court documents obtained by New York Post reports that the posts prompted a hearing and inquiry by Assistant Vice Principle and Dean of Students Keith Eldredge after 'members of the Fordham community felt threatened by the social media posts.'
Tong maintained that he wasn't threatening people, but instead making personal political statements. 
School officials launched an investigation into Tong that resulted in a June 10 hearing where he defended his posts.
Tong reportedly said he was 'sympathetic to the movement for racial equality' and his post about Dorn was 'to speak out against tyranny and oppression, while noting that the phrase has been used by various branches of the United States military.'
During the hearing, Tong added that he supported the Second Amendment right to bear arms and the photo was to illustrate that 'had students in China been afforded this right, there would have been fewer casualties at the hands of the Chinese State.'
It would take over a month for school officials to determine Tong's posts violated school protocol and placed a series of penalties on him.
Tong was put on disciplinary probation that banned him from participating in school office, student groups, sports and extracurriculars in the upcoming school year. 
If he violates his probation, Tong could face suspension or even expulsion from the university.
Tong will also be forced to complete his senior year online and can only be on campus after getting permission. He must undergo bias training and had to write a letter of apology by Thursday. 
But Tong said the 'draconian' punishments ostracized him among his peers and he's now 'treated like a criminal.
Tong refused bias training and said he won't write a letter of apology because 'he plainly did not violate any Fordham policies ... and should not have to submit to punishment for exercising his constitutional rights,' court documents read. 
Brett Joshpe, Tong's attorney, told New York Post: 'Fordham's disgraceful, Orwellian actions against our client are exactly why President Trump signed an Executive Order in 2019 specifying that schools can lose their federal taxpayer funding for violating their own free speech policies.
'Intellectual tyranny within the ranks of higher education-all for a mere $50,000 in annual tuition-must end right now.'
Tong, a Chinese immigrant, said he previously believed America was characterized by law and free speech, but that is 'no longer the case.'
'I was forcibly silenced, faced verbal and assaulting harassment from mobs, and subjected to Soviet-style interrogation and punishment by a Jesuit university that claims in its own code of conduct, that it protects ""freedom of expression and the open exchange of idea,""' he wrote in the letter. 
Tong doubled down on his push against Fordham University in an interview with Fox News host Laura Ingrham.
'I think they have an issue with anything they disagree with and they want to silence any voice they don't like and that's really what happened and they silenced me because they don't like what I said,' said Tong.
He added that he's 'not going to say sorry' and 'won't back down' from fighting Fordham University.
'This is not just my case. They took my life away. They put my future into a very bad place and that's why I'm going to bet all my future into this.' he said.
'We are going to be fighting hard. ""I'm going to be suing them very soon and we are going to be fighting for people across the country.'
Tong created a GoFundMe last week to raise money for litigation costs and , as of Thursday night, had raised more than $55,600.
He was also featured in a video by the National Rifle Association shooting a rifle and speaking about the incident.
'Fordham University accused him of owning an ""automatic weapon"" and they're trying to silence him, but this NRA member is not backing down,' the post read.
DailyMail.com has reached out to Tong for further comment. "

11,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_751/Files (250).DOCX","Eturbo News",2020-09-08,"2862 words",NA,NA,NA,"Does Crime Take a Holiday?",FALSE,"U.S., Sept. 8 -- Watching more TV news than ever? Thinking the country is overrun with bad guys looting and destroying storefronts? Thanks to the current elected officials. you know them, they occupy buildings and residents paid for with tax dollars and are totally clueless on how to contain COVID-19 while maintaining full employment - we have large amounts of unscheduled time available. The Internet and television offer us the opportunity to watch violence and crime erupting on the streets of cities and towns around the world amplifying the notion that we may be dormant but community disrupters are very busy.
Under different circumstances we would be happy campers with free time - seemingly endless recess! We would use this time to travel, workout at the gym, visit with friends and family, take additional college courses; however, COVID-19 time means that we are quarantined in our homes, unless, of course, we are fortunate to be part of the uber rich who flaunt their free time by jetting to their second (or third or fourth) homes, taking selfies on their yachts, showing their Zoom faces without makeup but with backdrops of glorious designer inspired homes and gardens. For those of us who are locked into small Manhattan apartments, time hangs heavy on our hands.
If it were only COVID-19 - perhaps we would be able to shoulder this medical emergency with greater confidence and aplomb. Unfortunately, it is not just the coronavirus, it is also the large numbers of unemployed, the demise of small businesses, the killing of people who have been murdered or harmed because of their color, not because of their actions. The damage to the American sense of democracy has been perpetrated by people who do not believe that protests are good for society and are important and visible ways to demonstrate our constitutional rights to freedom of speech and the right to assemble.
Through the protests and demonstrations, we learn every day that the people elected to lead our city, state and federal government agencies are totally inadequate as they lack the intelligence, moral compass and skill set necessary to lead us through these very dark days. From city councils to state legislatures, from mayors to governors, from senators to advocacy groups, how these individuals found their way to the top of many agencies and organizations is beyond my comprehension. These people would be challenged to run a neighborhood coffee shop and yet they have the authority (and the power) to run the United States of America, controlling how we live and how we die.
While many of us are spinning our wheels in quarantine, others are out and about creating mayhem in the streets. A look at recent crime statistics shows that in New York murders have increased by over 30 percent (235 vs. 181) for the first seven months of 2020 when compared to the first seven months of 2019. There were 244 citywide shooting incidents in July 2020, compared to 88 shooting incidents in July 2019, an increase of approximately 177 percent. Year to date, through July 31, there was a 72 percent spike in citywide shooting incidents (772 vs. 450). There has also been an increase in burglaries - up 31 percent (1297 vs. 989) in July and up approximately 45 percent (8594 vs. 5932) year to date through July 31.
It is interesting to note that for the month of July, rape decreased by approximately 6 percent (153 vs. 163); however, rape is under-reported and this statistic may not be correct. Although the media leads us to believe otherwise, hate crimes actually declined by approximately 29 percent (170 vs. 241).
When criminal activity is added to the pandemic, the on-going attention to nose swabs, airport restrictions, multiple closures to indoor dining and outdoor sports stadiums, and Broadway theatre halted until 2021, it is not a surprise that tourism in New York is on life-support. In the last quarter of fiscal year 2020, ending June 30, New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer estimated that the loss to the City in hotel taxes amounted to $270 million, plus, another $250 million in tourism related sales tax revenue for the same period.
In the days BC (before COVID-19), the Big Apple was the Real Deal, with record tourism growth for the last 10 years. In 2019, visitor spending supported in excess of 403,000 jobs, generating +/- $72 billion in total economic activity (July 2020 Report, NYC & Company). In 2019, travel and tourism activities were responsible for $7 billion in state and local taxes, including $4.9 billion for the New York City.
As a result of current conditions in New York, Stringer's office has projected a $1.5 billion loss for the city's tourism tax revenues in fiscal 2021, representing 25 percent of the city's normal revenue from hotel occupancy taxes and sales tax revenue.
In September 2019, the fall fashion shows, tennis matches and UN programs attracted over 908,000 people, producing hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue from such sources as hotels, restaurants, retail and public transportation plus sales and occupancy taxes.
The US Open tennis tournament (held at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, Queens) is being held without fans in the seats. In 2019, the event posted attendance of nearly 738,000 spectators with another 115,355 participating in the US Open Fan Week (7 days of free activities prior to the main event). Fashion Week will be held digitally, and it is unlikely there will be any live shows with audiences. Even St. Patrick's Cathedral is facing a $4 million budget crisis (25 percent of its annual income). The church relies on donations collected at Mass to operate (from lighting to staffing paychecks) and with visitor decline and the absence of fund-raising events, operating funds are just not available.
New York does not stand alone when it comes to tourism decline from a mix of criminal activity and COVID-19. The Northern Territories of Australia are facing increases in crime along with decreases in tourism. According to the Tourism Central Australia Chairperson, Dale McIver, the consequences of crime extends well beyond damage, ""The effect on not only the cost of the ongoing crime and damage, but the emotional wellbeing of business owners and staff."" To address the problems, conversations focus on increasing police presence and improved communications in order to update and inform the community about crimes. Government officials are also considering increasing the availability of truancy officers and youth workers to engage with troubled youth.
Between the costs associated with criminal activity and the loss of revenue through travel restrictions (due to COVID-19), there is likely to be an estimated loss of up to $15.9 million in visitor spend for the year ending March 2020. When this is combined with forward bookings through the Alice Springs Visitor Information Center, the Northern Territories are facing the lowest tourism numbers that Tourism Central Australia has seen in recent time. This usually popular part of Australia is in the middle of a multi-dimensional storm that threatens the economic base of the sector.
In Chile, the Undersecretary of Crime Prevention, Katherine Martorell, along with Mnica Zalaquett of Tourism, believes that informing visitors of crime issues will help to offset the problem, and assist visitors in understanding how NOT to become a crime victim, and how to avoid theft and robbery. Recommendations to tourists include prescheduling trips and sharing the schedule with others in case of an emergency. Crimes against tourists range from theft to robberies with violence and intimidation especially during the month of January and in the Metropolitan, Antofagasta and Valparaso regions.
In addition to civil unrest, Chile is in the throes of COVID-19 and the US State Department strongly recommends serious consideration before traveling to this destination; COVID-19 has increased the cautionary level from The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to a Level 3 Travel Health Notice. As of September 1, 2020, Chile registered 412,145 confirmed COVID-19 cases and is under curfew from 11 PM to 5 AM. Face coverings are mandatory.
To further deter travelers to this destination, borders and airports may be closed, there may be travel stops, stay-at-home orders, business closures and additional emergency conditions. Large-scale demonstrations have been reported in Santiago and other major cities. Many protests have resulted in property damage, looting, arson and transportation disruptions. Local authorities have used water cannons and tear gas to disrupt protests ( https://travel.state.gov ).
In 2019, BC (before COVID-19), the GDP for the Dominican Republic grew an estimated 5.1 percent. As a result of the pandemic, the IMF forecasts from April 14, 2020 the GDP is expected to fall to -1 percent. The US State Department has issued a Level 4 warning for the Dominican Republic which recommends a ""Do Not Travel"" advisory. COVID-19 (Level 3 Travel Health Notice, CDC), as of August 21, 2020 the DR reported 89,867 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 153 confirmed deaths.
Visitors to the DR are frequently the victims of crimes, including sexual assault, home invasions, armed robberies and murder. Weapons are available and when combined with illicit drugs and a weak criminal justice system visitors should proceed with extreme caution ( www.osac.gov ).
The Canadian government warns visitors of ""Rogue Lawyers"" who position themselves near the tourist police (CESTUR) station and attempt to recruit desperate foreigners who are brought to the station for detention purposes as clients. They try to extort excessive amounts of money from them by offering legal representation or assistance in getting out of jail.
Another warning note from the Canadian government calls attention to credit card and ATM fraud with a recommendation to avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature. Tourists should cover the keypad with one hand when entering their PIN and check carefully for unauthorized transactions on account statements.
Tourists are also warned to never leave food or beverages unattended or in the care of strangers and to be wary of accepting snacks, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances as these items might contain drugs that may put tourists at risk of sexual assault and robbery.
Women traveling solo may be the subject to harassment and verbal abuse. Incidents of assault, rape and sexual aggression against foreigners have been reported at beach resorts and some situations have implicated hotel employees. Women are advised to avoid taking public transportation or walking alone in the evening.
The tourism industry leadership in Greece expected that 2020 would be a year for recovery; however, the ongoing coronavirus outbreak has destroyed this optimism as the IMF forecasted a 10 percent contraction in GDP and an unemployment rate of 22.3 percent for 2020.
Before COVID-19, the tourism industry contributed 21 percent to the Greek economy. Because the country has been closed to non-EU and EU tourism Greece has experienced massive job losses in the industry. Greece was one of the first countries in Europe to lock down its economy resulting in a relatively small number of reported cases; however, the lock down has virtually stopped the tourism industry. When it reopened its borders to tourism in June, the country experienced an uptick in COVID-19 cases, with a very small increase in business.
There is some good news for visitors planning a visit to Greece in 2021; the US Department of State finds that Athens is a ""low-threat location for crime directed at or affecting official US government interests;"" however, travelers should be aware of street crimes (i.e., pickpocketing, purse snatchings and cell phone thefts) which occur in tourist areas and on the Metro system (rail and bus). Visitors should be on high alert when visiting ""Laiki"" (farmer's markets) as the event provides cover for criminal groups. The government also suggests caution at bars and clubs as some serve counterfeit or homemade spirits of unknow potency.
A real threat to visitors in Greece? Traffic fatalities! Greece has one of the highest rates of per-capita traffic deaths in the entire European Union. Serious accidents involve both motorcycles and scooters and the failure to use safety belts and motorcycle helmets - all increase the severity of traffic-related injuries. Most accidents occur in the evening during the summer and holiday season.
Traffic offenses in and around Athens and other large cities include: excessive speed, distracted drivers, non-compliance with right-of-way, indifference to traffic laws, obscured traffic signs, and heavy traffic. Outside urban areas, narrow mountain roads and cold weather can exacerbate treacherous driving conditions and closures. As an alternative to driving, the US State Department recommends using public transportation.
Within the next year or two, tourism will once again be added to the ""to do"" list for worldwide travelers who are very anxious to leave 2020 to the historians. As we put together lists of places to go and things to do for 2021 there are a few destinations that should be seriously reviewed before earning a place on the priority list.
According to Rhiannon Ball (Mapquest.com), the following destinations may require postponement:
Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. Violent organized crime, and drug trafficking makes this destination one of the most violent cities in Mexico. Crime is exacerbated because of police corruption. officers are employed or paid for by the drug cartels allowing many crimes to go unpunished.
Acapulco, Mexico. Gang violence and drug-related murders make this a dangerous area for travelers. This locale is called Mexico's ""murder capital,"" with one of the world's highest murder rates (142 per 100,000 people). Should you decide to visit, anyway, do not leave the safety of the resort.
Guatemala City, Guatemala. The nation faces drug-related violence, human and arms trafficking, high murder rates, street robberies, bus holdups and car jackings.
San Pedro Sula, Honduras. Considered one of the world's most violet cities, it has the highest homicide rates in the world (169 per 100,000). The country is also noted for arms trafficking and the use of illegal firearms and tourists encounter criminal activities in the form of muggings and theft.
Cape Town, South Africa. Poverty and social unrest leads to high violent crimes related to drugs and gangs with an estimated 100,000 people in over 130 different gangs (2018). Ball recommends avoiding dangerous neighborhoods and for women not to travel solo after sunset.
Another destination to examine for travel is Belize. The country is currently experiencing border and airport closures, travel prohibitions, violent crime (i.e., sexual assault, home invasions, armed robberies and murder). Travelers are advised to exercise caution when traveling to the south side of Belize City as local police lack the resources and training needed to respond effectively to serious criminal incidents (travel.state.gov).
The Mobility Market Outlook reports a decrease of approximately 34.7 percent or an estimated $447.4 billion decline in the global revenue for the travel and tourism industry in 2020. The good news is that this will ultimately change and now is an excellent time to consider 2021 and beyond.
Business and leisure travelers are planning their schedules for 2021 and should contemplate a few guidelines as they move forward:
Negotiate rates. It is very likely that rates will increase in 2021 so, to keep expenses low, negotiate air and hotel rates NOW.
Consider all costs. Look beyond the baseline price for air, hotels, and car rentals. While these economy rates may look enticing, do not ignore related costs (i.e., baggage fees, priority boarding, leg space, location) before settling on a price.
Look at travel expenditures for 2018 and 2019 before determining the amount of time and money available for travel in 2021 and 2022.
Americans plans to travel in 2021 (GetYourGuide.com) with a planned activity of 3.58 trips scheduled. AirportParkingReservations.com research finds that 39 percent of travelers are confident about travel in 2021 with 44 percent claiming they are ""somewhat confident."" Traveler Advisors COVID-19 Sentiment Barometer found strong interest in domestic destinations with 42 percent of inquiries focusing on US destinations.
Knowing that there is a better tomorrow, today is a good time to start hitting Google search to find the destinations that are the most appealing (i.e., no/low crime, excellent health care infrastructure, good roads and traffic controls), the dates you want to travel and a viable budget.
There is one more thing to do before heading off to your next destination. Register to VOTE!

Governor to participate in virtual 'Global Pride 2020' event on June 27
RICHMONDGovernor Ralph Northam is commemorating Pride Month in Virginia as sweeping new laws to expand rights and protections for LQBTQ+ individuals take effect on July 1. At the beginning of the month, the Governor issued a proclamation declaring June as LGBTQ+ Pride Month in the Commonwealth of Virginia to celebrate the state's LGBTQ+ communities and their fight for inclusion and equality.
""This Pride Month, we are reminded of the pivotal moments when LGBTQ+ Americans stood up to demand that they be treated with respect and dignity,"" said Governor Northam. ""As we celebrate long-overdue progress in advancing LGBTQ+ rights in our country and Commonwealth, we must also redouble our efforts to ensure Virginia is inclusive and welcoming to allno matter who you are, who you love, or how you identify.""
Each June, Pride Month commemorates the riots at Stonewall Inn in New York City that began on June 28, 1969, and mark the birth of the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement.
Pride Month also celebrates several landmark rulings from the United States Supreme Court that upheld LGBTQ+ rights and advanced equality in the United States, including decisions that struck down the Defense of Marriage Act in 2013, Obergefell v. Hodges in 2015, which guaranteed same-sex couples the right to marry, and affirmed that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects LGBTQ+ employees from discrimination based on sex in 2020.
During the last legislative session, Governor Northam took historic action to expand rights and protections for LGBTQ+ Virginians. He signed the Virginia Values Act, making Virginia the first state in the South to enact comprehensive protections for the LGBTQ+ community against discrimination in housing, employment, public spaces, and credit applications.
Governor Northam also signed legislation banning the harmful and controversial practice of ""conversion therapy"" for minors, which attempts to forcibly change an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity. And he signed new measures that increase protections for transgender students in Virginia public schools, give localities greater authority to ban discrimination, expand the definition of a hate crime to include criminal acts based gender identity and sexual orientation, and make it easier for LGBTQ+ individuals to obtain a birth certificate that matches their gender identity. These laws will become effective July 1, 2020.
On Saturday, June 27, Governor Northam will join LGBTQ+ activists and world leaders for Global Pride 2020, a 24-hour virtual Pride event organized in response to the hundreds of Pride celebrations that have been cancelled or postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Governor's pre-recorded message will air between 4:30 PM and 6:30 PM Eastern. See the full line up of speakers and performers here. Global Pride will be broadcast at globalpride2020.org and on Todrick Hall's YouTube, Facebook, and Revry.

BEN TRACY: Instead of focusing on the increasingly dire rise in coronavirus infections, President Trump went after NASCAR`s only full-time African- American driver, Bubba Wallace, today, demanding he apologize in falsely accusing him of perpetuating a hoax when a noose was found in his garage last month. It was later determined Wallace was not being targeted.
KAYLEIGH MCENANY (White House Press Secretary): This was not a hate crime, and he believes it go a long way if Bubba came out and acknowledged that as well.
BEN TRACY: Wallace responded to the President today, saying "".always deal with the hate being thrown at you with love, even when it`s hate from POTUS."" President Trump also seemed to defend the Confederate flag saying NASCAR`s recent decision to ban it, a move backed by Wallace has hurt its ratings, but they are actually up on several networks.

Also: Are N95 masks recommended for wildfires?
So far this year, California has been hit hard by wildfires, record high temperatures and power blackouts, all in the midst of a pandemic. One reader asked how residents with respiratory illnesses are faring.
Evan Underwood, who suffers from asthma, migraines and heat sensitivity, has been quarantined inside his home in San Ramon for months. And now, with wildfires raging through several Western states, if the air quality index — which measures pollution levels — goes above 100, going outside for even a few minutes would trigger an asthma attack and migraine that would last an entire day. His plan is to hunker down at home until fire season is over, as long as he doesn’t lose power or is forced to evacuate.
For our series answering readers’ questions about life during the pandemic, Mr. Underwood asked us about how smoke inhalation is affecting people who are high risk for severe Covid-19, like himself, and if they are more vulnerable to significant illness. “If our whole region is bathed in smoke, when so many people still have damaged lungs, the virus is still endemic and people are going back to work, that can’t be good, can it?” he wrote.
As my colleagues have reported, Covid-19 and smoke is a dangerous combination, as both affect the respiratory system, making those exposed to the virus more vulnerable.
Polluted air can also weaken the immune systems of healthy people, making them more susceptible to illnesses like Covid-19, according to experts from the Washington State Department of Health.
And studies have shown that in areas with poor air quality, people are more likely to die if they contract the virus.
[Read the latest updates on the wildfires burning across California, Washington and Oregon.]
“We know that people with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are at higher risk for both acquiring Covid-19 and having more severe symptoms if they do become infected,” said Dr. Jeanne A. Noble, an emergency medicine doctor and the director of the Covid-19 response at U.C.S.F. Medical Center’s emergency department. “Adding smoke inhalation into the mix will further increase the vulnerability of everyone to Covid-19, but particularly for those with respiratory problems.”
Dr. Noble said she could see smoke rising above the city as she drove over the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge to work on Aug. 19. Since March, the emergency department at U.C.S.F. Hospital has been using outdoor tents to properly space patients as they wait to be seen. The fumes will probably make them unusable.
“We’ve been strongly encouraging everyone to take things outdoors. It’s just so much safer. And now we can’t,” she said. “It’s essentially like winter coming early.”
In addition, Dr. Noble said her department would most likely be busier, as there is always an uptick in respiratory cases during power outages from people who rely on electrically powered CPAP machines for breathing or nebulizers for administering medicine. Heat is also a trigger for asthma and emphysema, she said.
For people who have been infected with Covid-19 and have lingering effects, Dr. Michael Daignault, an emergency room doctor at Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, said that since Covid-19 is a multi-systemic inflammatory disease, significant smoke exposure and inhalation, along with an underlying respiratory system disease, could possibly exacerbate symptoms.
“I think this depends on the primary symptoms a patient with Covid-19 had and their underlying medical problems,” he said.
In previous years, people have used N95 masks or respirators to protect themselves against inhaling dangerous particles caused by wildfire smoke.
But Allison Thomas, a reader in Butte County, asked us: “There are no N95 masks available for the general public to use. What are we going to use when the wildfires begin?”
Like everything these days, the pandemic has complicated things. Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state public health officials are telling people to save N95 masks for workers on the frontline of the pandemic.
The California Department of Public Health states on their website: “Don’t buy N95 respirator masks for personal use. They are part of PPE needed by medical professionals.”
Dr. Noble cautions against the use of N95 masks with exhalation valves. Although they are effective in filtering out particles from smoke, the valves let the wearer’s breath escape the mask, thus posing a risk for spreading Covid-19. If the mask contains an exhalation valve, she said you should wear a surgical mask over it.
If you are feeling the effects of smoke, you should try other means of exposure reduction first.
In its guide for wildfire smoke, the Environmental Protection Agency advised, “Respirators should only be used after first implementing other, more effective methods of exposure reduction, including staying indoors, reducing activity, and using HEPA air cleaners indoors to reduce overall smoke exposure.”
[What to know about buying an air purifier to clear wildfire smoke.]
If you cannot reduce your exposure in other ways, experts say N95 or N100 masks will work to filter out fine particles. But keep in mind that respirators are not approved for infants and small children and may not work on people with beards.
For people with respiratory illnesses, Dr. Daignault said to make sure you have enough medicine in stock and use breathing aids, like albuterol, when needed and seek medical attention if things worsen.
Dr. Noble said, “I think people are going to have to be really vigilant about watching the air quality.” She recommends checking the E.P.A.’s interactive map for updates. “Just as a lot of people have gotten in the habit of tracking Covid-19 numbers to see when their kid’s school might reopen or when their county gets off the watch list, I think people now need to get in the habit of checking the air quality index.”

Democrats unveiled a major police reform bill Monday amid nationwide protests over police brutality after the death of George Floyd in police custody.
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., unveiled the sweeping bill after joining Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., Black Caucus Chairwoman Karen Bass, D-Calif., and other top Democrats in kneeling on the floor while wearing kente scarves for nearly nine minutes. Former Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on Floyd's neck for the same amount of time before he died.
https://twitter.com/ABC/status/1269999247740502018
""We're here, because black Americans want to stop being killed,"" Harris said at a subsequent news conference. ""Reforming policing is in the best interest of all Americans.""
""The world is witnessing the birth of a new movement in our country,"" Bass added. ""A profession where you have the power to kill should be a profession where you have highly-trained officers accountable to the public.""
Hoyer said the House may be able to vote on the legislation before the end of June, though he was pessimistic about the legislation's chances in the Republican-led Senate.
The bill would ban ""no-knock"" warrants in drug-related cases, bar police chokeholds nationwide, create a federal database to track police misconduct, limit military equipment to police departments, make it easier to prosecute police officers and require departments to undergo racial bias training, Politico reported. The bill would also make lynching a federal hate crime after Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., blocked a similar piece of legislation in the Senate over concerns that the definition of ""lynching"" was too broad.
Republicans have alleged that Democrats want to ""defund"" the police, which many protest groups have called for during the demonstrations. The Minneapolis City Council has already vowed to dismantle the city's police department and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that he would shift funding for police to social services.
Bass on Monday pushed back on President Donald Trump's ""law and order"" messaging.
""I think for us, especially when it comes to this legislation, we feel that it is transformative - that it will transform the relationships our communities have with the police,"" she said. ""And I think for the 'law and order' message the president is spewing out of there, there's nothing new about that message, and I do not believe it will be successful.""
Bass on Sunday told CNN she does not ""believe that you should disband police departments,"" but states ""need to look at how we are spending the resources and invest more in our communities.""
Harris also acknowledged that there was a ""broader issue that is not being addressed in this bill.""
""The real way to achieve safe and healthy communities is to invest in those communities,"" she said, ""in affordable housing, in the ability for homeownership, jobs, funding for public schools, giving people access to capital so they can grow those small businesses that are part of the leadership and health of these communities.""
Schumer called for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to bring the bill to a vote by July 4.
""In the Senate, Democrats are going to fight like hell to make this a reality,"" he said. ""Leader McConnell, let's have the debate. Not just on TV and Twitter but on the floor of the United States Senate. A divided nation cannot wait for healing, for solutions.""
As Republicans criticized Democrats over growing calls to defund the police, some on the left criticized the party for not being more aggressive in its response to police brutality.
""Instead of kneeling, I want Democrats to be bold and unite over policies that will reform the system,"" CNN and New York Times contributor Wajahat Ali tweeted. ""If they can't do it, then it's just a performance.""
""Anyone who is supporting this bill or 'giving democrats credit' for this bill is not serious about the goal of ending police violence against black people. Full stop,"" journalist Ben Geier wrote. ""Are there steps in between where we are and police abolition? Sure. But this isn't it. This is throwing money to police to do the same sh*t they've already tried that doesn't work."""

The tension builds as the two women come face-to-face with one another
'Karen' is eventually slapped across the face before storming out of the store
A white woman was slapped across the face after she was caught on camera making racist remarks to another shopper at an Arizona gas station.
The footage appeared to have been shot over the weekend inside a store in Phoenix.
The video starts with the woman walking inside the shop asking for help with a petrol pump that did not appear to be working. 
Things escalated quickly and soon after an argument broke out between her and the other female customer. 
The man recording the footage claims that he heard the woman whom he describes as a 'Karen' tell the shopper to 'go back to her country' before telling the clerk behind the register not to serve her. 
The entire incident all builds up to a face-to-face confrontation which sees the two women shouting at each other before 'Karen' is seen shoving the woman.
It led to an immediate retaliation with the other woman defending herself and slapping her antagonist across the face. 
It ultimately led to the white woman walking out of the shop while she rambles at the person filming to mind their own business. 
Last month, another 'Karen' was shamed online after a black man recorded video of her hysterically calling the police on him after he asked her to leash her dog in Central Park. 
Harvard graduate Christian Cooper, 57, had been bird watching in an area of the park known as The Ramble over the Memorial Day weekend when he saw white investment banker Amy Cooper walking her unleashed dog that was 'tearing through the plantings'.
After pointing out to Cooper that dogs must be leashed at all times to protect wildlife habitats, the 41-year-old quickly became irate, dialing 911 wailing that 'an African American man is threatening my life'.
She has since issued an apology saying, 'I was the one who was acting inappropriately' and that 'I hope that a few mortifying seconds in a lifetime of 40 years will not define me in his eyes.'
In the hours that followed the videos emergence, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio branded Cooper a 'racist' as outrage over the incident rippled out nationwide.
Amy Cooper was terminated from her $170k-per-year role at as head of insurance investment solutions at Franklin Templeton shortly afterwards. 
A petition to ban her from Central Park for life also emerged, as did new legislation that would make falsely reporting an incident as a hate crime illegal from now on."

In a stirring eulogy in front of 2,500 people in his home city of Houston, civil rights activist, the Rev Al Sharpton, spoke of the legacy left by the 46-yearold, who gasped ""I can't breathe"" while a police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes in Minneapolis. The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with second-degree murder.
""God took the rejected stone and made him the cornerstone of a movement that is going to change the whole wide world,"" Rev Sharpton said, invoking a Bible parable.
He also referenced the pulling down of slave trader Edward Colston's statue in Bristol during a Black Lives Matter march last Sunday.
""All over the world I've seen grandchildren of slave masters tearing down slave master statues,"" he told mourners.
During the four-hour service, which was broadcast live on every major US television network, family members and politicians exhorted Americans to turn grief and outrage at his death into a moment of reckoning for the nation.
Mr Floyd's dying words have become a rallying cry for hundreds of thousands of protesters around the globe who have since taken to the streets to protest against racism and police brutality, undaunted by the coronavirus pandemic.
""I can breathe. And as long as I'm breathing, justice will be served,"" Mr Floyd's niece Brooklyn Williams declared in a eulogy that drew applause from mourners inside the Fountain of Praise Church. ""This is not just a murder but a hate crime.""
Joe Biden, Donald Trump's challenger for the White House in November's election, addressed the funeral service via a video recording, lamenting that ""too many black Americans wake up knowing that they could lose their life in the course of just living their life"".
""We must not turn away. We cannot leave this moment thinking we can once again turn away from racism,"" he said. The memorial was punctuated by gospel music and a video montage of shared memories of the man affectionately known as ""Big Floyd.""
Among those in attendance were relatives of several other black men killed by white police or white civilians, as well as the actors Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx.
Two columns of uniformed Houston police officers saluted the golden casket as it was wheeled from the hearse into the church before the service.

TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.
For most Americans who don't live in New York City, New York is a lot like your half-drunk nerduell uncle: flashy, loud, always bragging about himself though someone less impressive than he claims to be. You love your uncle, you just don't want to know too much about his personal life. There's no question, it is messy and weird. You suspect he owes a lot of people money, you know, he eats with his mouth open.
Still, he is your uncle. Your lives are intertwined. If he gets some incurable disease and dies, you will be sad about it -- and New York is the same way.
Even if you dislike New York too much to visit, you should care what happens there because you're an American and New York is by far this country's biggest city. ' New York has more than twice as many people, in second place, Los Angeles. It's physically tiny. The entire Island of Manhattan is smaller than Dallas, Fort Worth Airport, but New York produces close to 10 percent of our total GDP in this country.
So what happens to New York matters to the rest of us, like the place or not. Until recently, New York seemed to be thriving. Officials there have succeeded in doing the single most important thing that civic leaders anywhere can do.
They made their city safe for normal people to live there. New York is one of the least dangerous metro areas in the world. They bragged about it. There's no mystery how they did it. The city hired tens of thousands of cops. They threw criminals and anti-social destroyers in jail and they left them there and it worked.
New York improved dramatically. People with choices, people who could live anywhere wanted to live there.
And then in a short space of time, Mayor Bill de Blasio arrived and he set about reversing the formula. On the basis of no evidence, de Blasio attacked the Police Department of New York as racist. He then cut a billion dollars from the NYPD budget.
Demoralized cops stopped making arrests, and almost immediately, crime and violence in the city exploded.
In a single Manhattan neighborhood, the Upper Eastside, robberies have jumped by 286 percent this year. Things fell apart. New Yorkers who could leave the city did leave. The entire tax base fleeing to Florida.
Bill de Blasio watched these entirely predictable things happen, glassy eyed, breathing through his mouth probably too high to process it all. In the end, de Blasio concluded that none of it was his fault. New Yorkers, he decided, have had it too easy. What they need is more suffering.
So today, de Blasio announced that he plans to encircle the entire city with military style checkpoints, not to stop violent criminals, but prevent people from visiting from other places. There was no public discussion of this ahead of time. There was no debate, de Blasio just decreed it.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO (D), NEW YORK CITY: So starting today, we're going to do something new in New York City. We will have checkpoints at key entry points to the city.
Travelers coming in from those states will be given information about the quarantine. They will be reminded that it is required, not optional. They will be reminded that failure to quarantine is a violation of state law and it comes with serious penalties.
In fact, under certain circumstances, the fines can be as high as $10,000.00.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: Got that? It doesn't make any sense at all. He didn't bother to explain why they're doing it. There's no science behind it. But the one thing that you know for sure is, it's your fault, not his -- yours. Your failures are a severe violation of the law says Bill de Blasio. You'll be punished if you disobey. You are bad.
So travelers to New York City are about to learn a very important lesson. It's a lesson that residents of nursing homes in New York, the ones who survived, have already learned. And it's this, the people who make the worst decisions, the decisions that kill people never face consequences for those decisions. Only you do. So shut up and show us your papers, peasant.
Now, one of the many ironies here -- and there are many -- is that back in March of this year, New York threatened to sue the State of Rhode Island for trying to set up the very same kind of checkpoints.
At the time, Andrew Cuomo, he is the Governor of New York, called checkpoints like this, quote, ""unconstitutional and reactionary."" So what changed?
Well, who knows? Don't waste your time looking for consistency. Bureaucracies don't have to be consistent because they're in charge. They can do whatever they want. They don't have to explain why.
So the very moment that they've decided to treat taxpayers of New York like refugees in a war zone, with checkpoints, leaders in New York seem to be doing all they can to make life easier for thugs with guns.
Back in May, for example, the City of New York released a gang member from custody without bail. He'd been charged with attempted murder, but they just let him go.
Here are pictures of the alleged crime. Imagine letting that guy -- the guy with the gun -- shooting someone on the sidewalk, just walk out free. Why would you do that? You would have to hate the people who live in your city in order to do that.
Prosecutors say that that suspect, a man called Darrius Sutton, went on after New York led him out to commit three more shootings, because of course he did.
Bill de Blasio doesn't want to talk about any of that. He doesn't want you to talk about it either. The thing about social justice is you're just going to have to ignore the details.
Instead, city officials would like you to stay terrified of the coronavirus because more anxiety about invisible viruses will take your mind off the shootings and the decay.
So in a few days, New York will begin following and harassing travelers. They're going to text and call you if you plan to travel. If you don't respond, city workers may come to your home in person.
Listen to a man called Ted Long explain the plan. He runs something called the Test and Trace Corps in New York.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TED LONG, HEAD, TEST AND TRACE CORPS, NEW YORK CITY: Tomorrow, we're going to be deploying teams to Penn Station to stop travelers to ensure that they've completed the travel form.
We've made more than 86,000 phone calls to travelers coming into New York City from the designated high risk states, and we've sent more than 20,000 text messages to date.
And if we can't get through to you on the phone, we've deployed teams that are now knocking on your door to check in with you.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: Oh, so Ted Long is going to deploy teams to Penn Station. Have you been to Penn Station recently? It's a homeless shelter. The whole thing. Oh, there's a guy with his trousers down relieving himself in the corner. Hey, they're dealing crack right there. Oh, they're smoking it over here.
Go to Penn Station and ask yourself, is this real? Is this America? But Ted Wong is going to deploy teams to hassle people who are traveling to New York, to help the city stay afloat. Right?
Keep in mind, the vehement little lecture you just heard about public health comes from the same people who forced coronavirus patients into nursing homes and killed many by doing it.
These are the same leadership lead violent rioters control of the city streets, but suddenly they are very concerned about your health. Right?
What they're actually concerned about, as always, is maintaining political control. And of course, money. Money is suddenly a pressing concern for them. And the main problem is -- and they're going to fix this if they can -- that under our current system, it's pretty difficult to force people to remain in crumbling cities because for now, we still have freedom of movement.
Rich people are running away from New York. They have more freedom of movement than anyone because they can afford to go wherever they want, and they see what's coming. It's pretty obvious. They plan to be somewhere else when it arrives.
And this raises the question of who is going to pay for all of these failed and poisonous social experiments? The ones that turned a train station into a homeless shelter in Midtown?
Andrew Cuomo is smart enough to be worried about this. He is now begging millionaires to come back to the hellhole he helped create.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): We used to be worried millionaires tax people might leave. No, no, no. The burden shifted. We're trying to get people to come back.
I literally talk to people all day long, who are now in their Hampton house, who also lived here, or in their Hudson Valley house or in near Connecticut weekend house. And I say, you've got to come back. When are you coming back? We'll go to dinner. I'll buy you a drink. Come over. I'll cook.
They're not coming back right now.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: It's pathetic. It's pathetic. Well, they're in their Hampton house. Come back to New York. It's great. I'll meet you at Penn Station. We'll get a burger and some hepatitis.
Yes. So it turns out rich people may be evil, but in the end, you need a few of them to pay for everything otherwise you have no political power. That's an obvious truth that Cuomo is in effect saying.
The city's pothead mayor, by contrast, cannot admit that out loud. It's entirely possible he doesn't even understand the principle.
But Bill de Blasio does know that his disintegrating city will need money from somewhere and soon, so he is thinking that the rest of America should pay for his disaster.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DE BLASIO: If we do not get Federal support soon, I'm very worried about the stimulus talks in Washington, Wolf, because they seem to be going nowhere fast.
My challenge is, where am I going to have the people to do this work? I may have to do as many as layoffs of 22,000 city employees from every department by October 1st if I don't get Federal help.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: So consult your Bill de Blasio cheat sheet. Look it up. We keep ours right here. And if you do, you will see that it was less than a month ago that this same man, Bill de blasio, threatened to sue the Federal government if they helped too much, if they deployed Federal law enforcement officers to his city.
Now, he's whining that the Feds are not doing enough. Shameless? Obviously. Of course, it is. And yet to be fair, it's possible that de Blasio has no short term memory left and simply doesn't remember what he said last month.
Either way, Matt Walsh has been watching all of this very carefully. He hosts ""The Matt Walsh Show"" for ""The Daily Wire."" We're always happy to have him on our show. He joins us now.
Matt, thanks for coming on. So, again, the ironies are kind of inexhaustible here, but one of them is New York City seems to be doing a little better with respect to COVID-19, but the restrictions are getting more severe. I'm beginning to suspect it's not entirely about public health.
MATT WALSH, CONTRIBUTOR, THE DAILY WIRE: Yes, I think so. Speaking of ironies, you know, the other great irony, of course, is that we've got people in the street that are screaming about fascism coming to America, and in a way they're sort of right. We do -- you know, you've got checked by in New York City.
You've got Bill de Blasio, saying he is going to shut down churches. He's going to shut down churches permanently he claims if you dare go worship and practice your religion.
So that's a good example of actual fascism, but the people that are worried about fascism aren't worried about that type. They're worried about the imaginary type of racist cops prowling the street, murdering innocent people. It just isn't happening.
But I think with the coronavirus, look, a lot of the news is pretty good right now, relatively speaking, we're past the -- you know, we're on the other side of the curve in New York and you know, Texas and Florida.
You know, we already know that the mortality rate is much lower than what we originally thought. We were originally told, especially if you're below retirement age. We've known for a while that if you're a child, you know, children are very unlikely to contract it or spread it.
So that's all positive news. But I think the problem is that from the media's perspective, they've already told us that Donald Trump is literally Hitler and he is up for reelection, and so for -- it would take a lot of integrity, I think on the media's part to actually report the good news because they know that it's going to help the guy they hate and so we have to ask ourselves, does the media have that kind of integrity? Of course, they don't.
They've got a nuclear weapon politically speaking with the coronavirus that they can use against Trump and do they have the discipline and integrity not to use it? The answer is no, they don't.
CARLSON: It's just amazing if they can ignore the decay around them. If you woke up one morning and there was a vagrant in your living room shooting heroin or setting fires, would you turn to your wife and say, you know, I'm really concerned about COVID-19? No, you'd say get the vagrant out of the living room. Like how can they ignore what's happening right in front of them?
WALSH: Well, I think you nailed it. You said that they despise or de Blasio despises the people that he governs. I think that has a lot to do with it, or at least he doesn't care.
I think whether it's despise or indifference, I think the real issue is and this is why we're seeing cities across the country that are run by Democrats are in shambles, and I think one of the reasons is that Democrat voters and leftists, they vote for ideologues, they vote for people that say the right things and have the right ideology.
Bill de Blasio has the right ideology, according to them anyway. Now, he is completely incompetent as a governor when it comes to actually doing things. He's a total joke. He's a clown.
He says the right things and so that's why they elect him and this is what happens.
CARLSON: I just want to go there without getting mugged. That's it. Not too much to ask. Matt Walsh, great to see you. Thank you so much.
WALSH: Thanks a lot.
CARLSON: So around the country, you're seeing politicians because they are politicians, they can't control themselves, use coronavirus restrictions to reward their friends and punish their enemies.
In Anchorage, Alaska, the mayor, a guy called Ethan Berkowitz, blocked off the street to allow a wine bar to stay open with on-street seating. He prohibited indoor food and drink services in everyone else's restaurants.
The thing about that wine bar, he has financial ties to the wine bar, apparently. We'd love to have on the show to explain that. By the way, he is welcome anytime.
You're seeing that a lot. You're seeing it in New Jersey. The owner of the Atilis Gym in Bellmawr, they've gone through all of this, many abuse of coronavirus policies. They have gone to great lengths to keep their customers healthy. Not a single one has become infected with the virus at their business. But it's not enough to satisfy the Governor, Phil Murphy.
Atilus Gym would like to do what it does, which is help people stay healthy. If it were selling liquor or lotto tickets or committing abortion, they'd be able to stay open. But they can't. They've defied the order. Now, they're facing prosecution and fines for what they've done.
On Saturday, they broke into their own gym to keep it open for customers. Here's a clip.
[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]
CARLSON: The gyms owners, Ian Smith and Frank Trumbetti spoke to the resident bodybuilder over at CNN last night. It makes sense. Here's how that went.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
FRANK TRUMBETTI, OWNER OF ATILUS GYM: You're knocking Trump because of the total numbers.
CHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR: I'm not knocking -- I'm knocking Trump because he is not doing -- hold on. Frank --
TRUMBETTI: Fifty three point three percent of the debts come from 0.06 percent of the population. Bottom line, that's [bleep] upset that nobody is talking about.
CUOMO: Frank, watch your mouth, we're on television.
TRUMBETTI: Sorry, sir. I'm sorry.
CUOMO: Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. I get the passion.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: Oh, gym owners who can do math. I guess they weren't they weren't expecting that. That's too great.
Ian Smith and Frank Trumbetti join us tonight. Gentlemen, that was quite a performance. I am just going to let you jump in and explain. What was your take away from that exchange? What did you learn?
TRUMBETTI: We learned actually, if actually, you put the facts out there, it doesn't matter what side of the line they're on, they are going to listen and they're going to actually not be able to rebut you because I gave facts. We put things out there that actually on, you know, the fake news network, they don't actually put out there for anybody else and our hope in going on there was to actually provide the real data that was out there for the people who actually don't believe that these things are going on.
He couldn't argue with anything I said, because I was a hundred percent right and that was the most important thing.
CARLSON: You have faith and reason. You're a son of the enlightenment. Amen. I love this. I love that you guys own a gym.
So, Ian, we've talked a number of times on this show. You all had been -- I think it's fair to say persecuted by the State of New Jersey. Two questions for you, quickly. One, has anybody been -- I ask you this every time. Has anyone been infected with COVID-19 in your gym? And two, where are you in your legal fight to keep working?
IAN SMITH, OWNER, ATILUS GYM: Our current total right now is 15,546 COVID- free visits to our facility and the legal fight, we have a couple things coming up. They're throwing everything they can at us.
Next Tuesday, at five o'clock, we go in front of the town of Bellmawr. They're trying to revoke our business license. We are going to be in court later this week. Governor Murphy is requesting that the courts fine us in the amount of $10,000.00 per day every day that we've been in operation.
And they even cited reason not based off of our income, but based off of the amount that was in our GoFundMe. So he basically admitted that he is trying to cripple our legal defense fund by fining us to death with it.
And finally, he's, he's looking for possible imprisonment of six months or more.
CARLSON: Imprisonment, okay, for keeping people healthy during a pandemic. So I just have to ask you guys. You were just on with quite an avid workout fan over on CNN, would you invite him, the governor's brother into your gym? Would you let him work out at Atilus Gym in Bellmawr?
TRUMBETTI: Absolutely. I would love for him to show up -- and Governor Murphy.
SMITH: Our gym is open for any politician to the local all the way up to the highest office in the land to come and see the protocol that we've put in place. That's why we did it in the first place.
There was no plan in place, and we wanted to work with government. And to this day, at least the State of New Jersey is not interested in doing so.
TRUMBETTI: We would invite Donald Trump to come in and check the place out.
CARLSON: You guys are brave. I love it. Thank you for coming on. I really appreciate it and Godspeed as always.
SMITH: Thank you, Tucker.
TRUMBETTI: Thank you.
CARLSON: So a store clerk in Arlington, Virginia was confronted by armed burglars he shot at them and now he is the one in trouble. The store owner says the burglars are walking free tonight.
The more you know about this case, the more mind bending it is. Stay tuned for that.
Plus, Joe Biden confronted about taking a cognitive test. His reaction on camera. Pretty amazing. We'll show it to you after the break.
CARLSON: Joe Biden is doing pretty well in the polls. The only problem for his staff is when he is allowed to speak in public, it often doesn't go well. He struggles to remember simple things. What year it is, what state he's in, what his wife looks like.
Today, a reporter Astro Biden if he'd ever take any cognitive test, and here's how it went.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ERROL BARNETT, CBS REPORTER: Have you taken a cognitive test --
JOE BIDEN (D), PRESUMPTIVE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE No, I haven't taken a test. Why the hell would I take a test?
Come on, man. That's like saying you, before you got in this program, you take a test where you're taking cocaine or not. What do you think, huh? Are you a junkie?
I'm so forward looking to have an opportunity to sit with the President or stand with the President in debates.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: As far as we know, Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana didn't take a cocaine test before coming on tonight. Come on, man. We still don't think he's a junkie. He joins us now.
Senator, great to see you. You're not a junkie are you?
SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA): No, sir. I was just listening to that tape and I would offer the observation, Tucker that Vice President Biden's handlers have clearly decided that the very best campaign that the Vice President can offer to the American people was no campaign.
CARLSON: Yes.
KENNEDY: That's why they're hiding him. On most days, even Google can't find him. Is that because of his health? I don't know. I hope not.
My biggest concern with the Vice President is his policies. He has changed. He no longer wants to be the second coming of Barack Obama, which, in my estimation would be bad enough. He has now decided that he wants to be the second cousin of Bernie Sanders and Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez.
And look, this is America. You're entitled to believe what you want, but they believe -- they don't believe that America is an exceptional country. They believe that America is wicked. They believe that most Americans, white Americans anyway, are racist, and misogynistic and ignorant and evil, and I don't agree with that.
Instead of having gratitude for America, they have contempt. And I don't agree with that either.
They now believe, apparently, all for edict, socialism and illegal immigration and abortion are moral goods. And I don't believe that either and that's not the America that I want my son to grow up in.
CARLSON: Amen. I agree with that completely. Quickly, Senator, there does seem to me something very cynical about a candidate hiding his real program or hiding himself.
I mean, agree or disagree with the ideas that you just explained, don't voters have a right to hear them explained?
KENNEDY: Well, of course they do, and when you decide that the very best campaign you can offer to the American people is no campaign, and that your campaign slogan is the other guy is worse than me that doesn't present the American people with a legitimate choice in my opinion.
Now, is it because of his health? I don't know. I mean it, I hope not. But the American people deserve to know what their President stands for, and in this case, he has clearly changed. The Vice President has changed.
CARLSON: I think that's right, and you knew him before I've known him a long time also. And you're absolutely right, he has changed and that's sincere. That is totally right.
Senator Kennedy.
KENNEDY: Thank you, Tucker.
CARLSON: Good to see you.
KENNEDY: You too.
CARLSON: So Joe Biden's wife Jill appeared on Fox News yesterday. She wants you to know that her husband is just fine.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Listen to this and let's get your reaction.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Biden can't put two sentences together. I say he is not competent to be President. To be President, you have to be sharp and tough and so many other things. He doesn't even come out of his basement.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: What do you think about that characterization?
DR. JILL BIDEN, WIFE OF JOE BIDEN: You know, Joe is anything but that characterization. You know, we've been campaigning. We've been listening to the expert, the scientists and the doctors, and they have told us, stay home and be safe, and I think Donald Trump is really about Joe's age.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: Dana Perino did that interview as you saw. She hosts ""The Daily Briefing."" It's 2:00 p.m. weekdays Eastern. She also co-hosts ""The Five,"" and joins us. We're happy about that. Dana, great to see you tonight.
So what was your -- just give us an overview. You talked to Joe Biden's wife, Jill, and what did you think?
PERINO: So she has written a book called ""When the Light Enters"" and I read it over the weekend and had a chance to interview her when the paperback edition came out. And when I -- you know, I didn't know a lot about her. I didn't know that she was the first second lady to work the entire time.
She was a community college professor at Northern Virginia Community College, even while she was in the White House. Well, you know, obviously, as second lady.
I wanted to ask her those questions because she spends more time with Joe Biden than anybody else, and I know that she is fiercely protective of her family, as a lot of people are and should be. And even President Trump said today, she should have defended him. That's exactly appropriate.
CARLSON: I agree.
PERINO: The question about his capabilities and his policies, that's why I think the debates are so important, because when you have the two of them at a debate with no audience this year, there are no safeguards. There's no handlers. There's no guardrails, right? It's just going to be the two of them, and then the American people can decide what they think about their cognitive abilities.
CARLSON: I think that's a very wise point. I think it's absolutely true. And as of today, they seem to have boxed themselves in to appearing the Biden campaign at all three of those scheduled debates unless I'm missing something.
PERINO: No, so I asked her yesterday, will he debate? She said, of course.
His spokesperson today again said he will debate, Joe Biden himself said he will debate. They'd say that Donald Trump is the one who hasn't said in writing to the commission that he'll debate. And I guess somebody could start a rumor that President Trump won't show up at the debates.
But I think both of them need to debate. We deserve a debate in this country. And they're going to want to debate because the American people, some of these ads, they'll tune them out. People are going to be focused after September.
I think that the numbers, the polling that you'll see at the end of August will be a lot tighter than what you saw at the end of July, and then you're going to have to decide, you know, which of these two guys do you want for the next four years as you look at the last four years? And can the President figure out a way to allow the media to focus on Joe Biden rather than the media focusing totally on him and he gives him so many opportunities all day long.
CARLSON: Yes, it would. I think it would be helpful for the country to know more about where Biden stands on things now. You raise a good point. Dana Perino, great to see you. Thank you.
PERINO: All right. Have a good night.
CARLSON: Thanks. So an immigrant store clerk who makes basically nothing was in the store when burglars broke in and he defended himself and for that, he is being punished. He is on house arrest tonight. The man who tried to rob him is out on the street. The store owner joins us tonight to tell us about the rogue prosecutor who made that possible.
Also, Democrats caught on video refusing to distance themselves from Antifa, a domestic terror group. Hard to believe that we have that tape, next.
CARLSON: Here's a story that will enrage and shock you. An immigrant employed at a tobacco shop in Arlington, Virginia, exactly the sort of person who left is always telling you they defend, defended himself against an early morning burglary by firing three warning shots at the burglars. He wounded one of them, not fatally.
In a shocking inversion of justice. That man, the immigrant clerk is under house arrest and the man who owns the store says the burglar, the ringleader of the group who broke in has been cleared of all charges and walks free tonight. How does that work? Exactly.
Jowan Zuber owns the Arlington smoke shop in Arlington, Virginia and we are happy to have him back on the show tonight. Mr. Zuber, thank you so much for coming on.
So to the most shocking part first, the man who defended himself is under house arrest, but the burglar has been let out. Are you sure?
JOWAN ZUBER, SMOKE SHOP OWNER, ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA: I am hundred percent sure. This is so sad and this is so shocking. The justice system is not working in Arlington, Virginia. We went to court on July 30th, and finally we see the video. I hope that the Arlington County could share the video exactly and is edited by the prosecutor's office because they do not play the volume.
The reason why they don't play the volume because they've broken so violently, that the volume will be enough to get Hamza off the charges. So what happens, we saw the video, three masked men rush in and he even said they all had knives. They all had weapons. They were prepared with mask and gloves.
And when they approached, Hamza even had scream of warning, but they decided to ignore, so when Hamza opened the bedroom door. He meets guy face-to-face with a mask on all black. He admitted it was pitch black. The criminal admit it was pitch black, and as soon as he meets face-to-face, what Hamza does, shoots him, close the door, because there's three people in there.
He closes the door, picks up the phone, calls the police, opens the door again, the guy is not on the ground no more. They're actually running around the shop, so he shoots two more times because he's scared for his life. This never happened to him before.
And what happens was one of the guys drags the other criminal out outside. That's when the officers arrived and they put Hamza in jail and that's very sad. And I still can't believe it that he was being protected by the prosecutors and the prosecutor's office is very upset that I came on your show and speak the truth.
And now they're looking at the whole thing a different way. They want to show me and Hamza, something different. I can't believe they're protecting the criminal. I'm sure if the criminals broke to their house, they would be doing 10 years in jail right now.
And poor Hamza has a GPS on him. He has to pay $350.00 out of his pocket every month for the GPS, $800.00 child support. Poor guy he cannot take his five year old daughter to the park. He cannot play soccer with his son.
While the criminal right now on Snapchat, on Instagram, smoking joint, celebrating that he is free and this gives the community juveniles out there, hey you could go rob and steal and the prosecutor will stand next to you and defend you and put the real people who work hard, who try to live the American dream and put them in jail.
This is very sad. Parisa Tafti, the prosecutor hears this and Joshua Katcher, please look deep into this case. You have kids. You understand. I'm sure if the criminals broke into your house, this would -- it would be a total different thing.
And we're all also still struggling. We have a court appointed lawyer, but we definitely need help out there because this is sad for justice. This is not -- this is injustice really.
CARLSON: It enrages me hearing that, and the armed robber is smoking weed on Snapchat while your employee --
ZUBER: Yes, on Instagram and hanging out --
CARLSON: He is sleeping in the store to protect it, and they break in and threaten him with knives. Defending yourself is now a crime. The whole thing is so grotesque and Orwellian.
Mr. Zuber, I appreciate your coming on and I hope that you will keep us posted on what happens and I hope the prosecution should be ashamed of themselves, turn back from the course they've chosen.
ZUBER: Thank you.
CARLSON: Thank you.
ZUBER: Thank you so much for standing up for the truth. God bless.
CARLSON: It's shocking. While chaos has obviously gripped this country for months, good leaders would restore order because the weakest among us are always the most injured by chaos. But we don't have leaders like that. Instead, we have people like Massachusetts Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. AYANNA PRESSLEY (D-MA): As we reflect on the life of John Lewis, we've been revisiting many of our -- what I consider the original architects of the Black Lives Matter movement, okay, because as we have seen with movements, they will try to coopt it and undermine it and sanitize it and whitewash it.
But the Black Lives Matter activists that are today called Antifa were in the 1960s being called communists, okay? They were just as disruptive and agitating the status quo and just as impatient.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: So the real problem obviously is our education system. Presumably that person grew up in this country and learned absolutely nothing, and could therefore with a straight face tell you that the people burning down Wendy's and looting the Nike store are exactly like Martin Luther King. Right? They're the Civil Rights leaders of our times. They've been to the mountaintop. It's called CHAZ.
The Senate held hearings on all of this yesterday. Here's how it went.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. MAZIE HIRONO (D-HI): If this subcommittee wants to protect Americans right to peacefully assemble, we should be focused on preventing Federal officers from beating up protesters, teargassing them and shooting them.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: Like fellow Democrats in the Senate, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii lied about what's actually going on, what's actually going on is that thousands of Joe Biden voters are spray painting the F word on statues of Abraham Lincoln, racial slurs.
Senator Ted Cruz confronted her about the reality of what's happening and about Antifa.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX): Throughout her remarks, she still did not say a negative word about Antifa, nor has any Democrat here. They instead engage in a political game where they depend -- you're welcome to say something negative about Antifa right now.
HIRONO: I think that I've covered the subject quite well. You are not listening.
CRUZ: Okay, she declined to speak. So that is the position of the Democratic Party.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: Why is it so hard to condemn violence? We used to think that all of us would condemn violence. Violence? No. They won't.
Here's footage of the modern day Civil Rights protesters campaigning for justice.

CARLSON: Julio Rossa is a senior writer at Townhall. He shot the footage you just watched. We're happy to have him on the show tonight. Julio, thanks so much for coming on. Why is it so hard to condemn that? It doesn't seem hard to me.
JULIO ROSSA, SENIOR WRITER, TOWNHALL: No, you're right, Tucker. It shouldn't be hard, but it's really disturbing to see when you have Democratic senators not call out Antifa by name, especially when you consider that Portland is in day 69 of not just protests, but riots and I saw those riots firsthand when I was in Portland last week, and I saw how, despite the fact that the Federal Protective Service warned the crowd multiple times to stop throwing fireworks, stop infiltrating the fencing perimeter that had been set up, the crowd continued.
And so that forced the officers to have to come out to disperse them away from the fence, and I can say that the rioters made my job a lot harder because when I was recording the officers being attacked, when a rioter would throw a projectile from behind me. Naturally, the officers would respond with teargas, pepper balls and flashbangs ion my direction.
And so the video that you could see that I captured for Townhall, you could see me having to duck and get behind cover multiple times to avoid getting hit because a rioter would throw something from behind. So it was really quite frustrating for that to happen.
CARLSON: It's just -- it shouldn't be an act of bravery to walk through downtown an American city. The Feds could shut this down tomorrow, by the way. They actually could by arresting the people running it, but they're not. Interesting.
Julio, thank you for covering this and for the perspective and for your video. Appreciate it.
ROSAS: Thank you.
CARLSON: So we measure the strength of a political campaign by how much money they spend on political ads. But in fact, one campaign has the backing of the most powerful companies in the world, the tech companies, they're doing everything they can to help that candidate win, including silencing voices they don't like.
Heather Mac Donald was just silenced. She was censored by Google. She joins us next.
CARLSON: They're not taking salaries, but the richest people in the world, America's tech oligarchs are effectively working for the Joe Biden for President Campaign. They're doing their part by censoring anything that counters the official line they think might hurt Biden and that's why YouTube -- Google censored a lecture on the topic of policing by Heather Mac Donald. Here's a clip of what they censored.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
HEATHER MAC DONALD, AUTHOR, ""THE WAR ON COPS"": The idea that the police are wantonly killing black men, is a creation of a politicized press and an elite establishment dedicated to the idea that racism is America's defining trait.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: They fear Heather Mac Donald because Heather Mac Donald knows the numbers because she wrote a terrific book on it called ""The War on Cops."" We're happy to have her on tonight.
Heather, tell us how you were censored and why you think you were censored if you would?
Heather, I'm not -- I don't know if Heather Mac Donald can hear us. Heather, can you hear? Oh, you can. Great.
So tell us how you were censored by Google and why you think they censored you?
MAC DONALD: Well, Tucker, in 1860, Frederick Douglass said that free speech was the dread of tyrants. It was that right which they first of all strike down, and facts are the dread of our Silicon Valley oligarchs, facts which disprove their favorite narrative that America is endemically racist.
I gave a speech last week on policing that used Federal data, the gold standard to disprove the lie that police are engaged in wanton racist violence against black men as Joe Biden and the rioters maintain.
No sooner had I finished the speech, then Google wiped it off the web on the grounds that it violated its community guidelines for keeping YouTube a safe space for all.
My host, the Center of the American Experiment appealed the decision. YouTube grudgingly put it back on, but with age restrictions, meaning that your child can't watch the speech unless you sneak them in behind you.
Now here's what your child can watch, Tucker, in the privacy of his bedroom, a porn star giving a lap dance. Nubile naked young women spooning with an equally naked young man, a narco communist praising the destruction of a Minneapolis police precinct as the high point of the rioting to date, and tips on how to become an Antifa warrior.
Now those videos do contain salacious content, and arguably do incite violence, unlike my speech, which condemned violence, and especially the violence that has taken hundreds of black lives since the rioting began.
So what's the problem with it? The only thing I can conclude, Tucker, is that it gives young people facts that will allow them not to become an Antifa warrior, and not to join in the destruction of the civilized order, which is tearing this country apart.
CARLSON: So your children can watch pornography, but they're not allowed to watch a scholar read Federal crime statistics out loud, and nobody is doing anything about it. Nobody is standing up to protect our right to tell the truth and to even read facts.
Has anyone stood up for you by the way? Just wondering.
MAC DONALD: Has anybody -- what?
CARLSON: Stood up for you? Has anyone in power -- I don't know sending a threatening letter to Google saying we're not going to put up with this in this country, this formerly free country?
MAC DONALD: Well, again, the Center for the American Experiment has appealed, and they're appealing the age restrictions. But I don't know. Obviously, there's a revolt going on.
What we know is that the Big Tech companies are filled with leftist that can't stand the facts.
CARLSON: Yes. They also operate at the mercy of the Federal government, which has done nothing. And it's really -- in the autopsy of this moment, I hope that blame is assigned.
Heather Mac Donald, great to see you. Thank you so much.
MAC DONALD: Thank you, Tucker.
CARLSON: You won't believe who showed up at an anti-police BLM rally in Midtown Manhattan. Pretty amazing. It's next.
CARLSON: So guess who showed up at a BLM protest the other day in Manhattan to attack the police and demand quote, ""justice""? Jussie Smollett, the fake hate crime guy, the guy who made America a little less just and a little more divided by staging a fake assault on himself then blaming an ethnic group for it. That guy, the single most privileged man in America.
Nauseating, you say? Ridiculous? Fraudulent? Yes. Absolutely, but not really any more than the rest of it.
That's it for us. Sean Hannity right now."

The police would arrest them for touching, kissing, or dancing — all actions that were considered disorderly conduct[1].The Stonewall veteran told Business Insider there is a tremendous lack of knowledge when it comes to how bad LGBTQ people were treated throughout America's history.He is happy with the progress the movement has made, but feels there's still a long way to go.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[2]. Fifty one years ago, on a steamy June 28th evening, New York policemen showed up at the Stonewall Inn for what was then considered a routine raid of gay bars.Joe Negrelli, a 68-year-old New Yorker, remembers that night well. He was 17 at the time.""It was indescribably hot,"" he told Business Insider. ""You see, apartments back then, they were walk-ups and they didn't have air conditioning. 
So when it got hot and humid, it got unbearable.""Because of the weather, there were more people at the bar than usual. That meant more potential arrests, Negrelli explained.The Stonewall Inn was one of only a handful of bars in Manhattan that served drinks to LGBTQ clientele. Back then, you could be thrown out of a bar if there was even suspicion that you might be gay, lesbian, transgender, or otherwise queer.This wasn't the first encounter with police for many of the Stonewall patrons that evening.""If two men or two women were holding hands in public, the nicest thing a police officer would do was demand they stop. Most of the time, they threw slurs at you and beat you with their baton,"" Negrelli said.Raids were regular, especially at the Stonewall Inn. Police would claim the bar was operating without a proper liquor license. They would arrest LGBTQ people for touching, kissing, or dancing, actions considered disorderly conduct[3].And at those raids, LGBTQ people weren't just arrested, however. They were often also photographed by members of the media, who would then publish their full names and photos in their newspapers. As a result, those arrested would often get evicted from their homes or fired from their jobs. There were little civil rights protections, explained Negrelli, who is a member of the SAGE USA[4], an advocacy group for LGBTQ elders.Public outings caused by these arrests had serious consequences. State officials, and even parents of minors, could mandate forced lobotomies of gay men[5], a brutal ""conversion therapy"" practice.So when the police showed up that evening at the Stonewall Inn, the patrons decided to resist.""People were really pissed off. They were really irked to the point where they decided to stand up for the first time in their life,"" he said.As the group grew angrier, someone threw a glass bottle in the direction of the police. According to Negrelli, an officer demanded that whoever threw the bottle come forth and submit to arrest.After a few seconds of silence, another glass bottle was thrown in the direction of the police. Then a garbage can was flung in the officer's direction. Soon, police tried to barricade themselves inside the bar, at which point a bottle containing cigarette lighter fluid, which most smokers carried with them, was set on fire and thrown into the bar.A small fire broke out, Negrelli said, and chaos ensued. Backup riot police were called in, and many were arrested.A year later, hundreds of people gathered again outside the Stonewall Inn to commemorate the anniversary of the uprising. That march, from Greenwich Village to Central Park, would become what's widely know as the first Pride parade[6]. ""If you had told me decades ago that the gay liberation movement would get to this point, where we'd go from being arrested, evicted, fired from our jobs for being gay to now the Supreme Court ruling we can't be discriminated against at work, I wouldn't believe you! I can't believe it's happened during my lifetime,"" he said.Negrelli added, however, that the movement still has a long way to go, citing discrimination and anti-gay and anti-transgender violence across the country.According to the most recent FBI data[7], there were 7,120 hate crime incidents reported in 2018. More than 1,300 of those — nearly 19% — were committed against LGBTQ people. In 2019, advocates tracked[8] at least 27 deaths of transgender or gender nonconforming people in the US due to fatal violence, the majority of whom were Black transgender women, per the Human Rights Campaign[9]. And GLAAD and The Harris Poll's 2019 Acceptance Index[10] showed a decline in LGBTQ acceptance among younger Americans.There are many Americans who don't know how much intolerance there was and still is today, Negrelli said. ""There's a tremendous lack of understanding of how far the LGBTQ movement has come,"" he said.This year, Pride parades across the country, including New York City's, have been canceled due to the coronavirus. But that doesn't mean people aren't marking the important day; many are tuning into online events, like the virtual Global Pride[11] on June 27.

Have a great week. And we'll see you next, ""FOX NEWS SUNDAY.""
MARK LEVIN, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, America. I'm Mark Levin. This is LIFE, LIBERTY & LEVIN. We have two wonderful guests tonight on part two of the Insurrection.
Our first guest is Dr. Carol Swain. Dr. Swain taught at Princeton where she was tenured. She was a tenured Professor of Political Science at Vanderbilt University. She has a BA in Criminal Justice, a Masters in Law, a PhD in Political Science. Really, a remarkable woman.
She's also part of the 1776 Unite Group that Bob Woodson has organized and is a part of the Black Voices for Trump Advisory Board member and I could go on and on.
Dr. Swain, you're very, very impressive. For people who don't know, give us a little bit of your background.
DR. CAROL SWAIN, PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE, VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY: Well, I'm an American success story. I was one of 12 children born and raised in the rural south. We all dropped out of school after completing the eighth grade.
I married at 16 and had my first child by 17. By the time I was 20, I had three small children. And the boys went to a community college and got the first of five degrees and I eventually became a successful University Professor, earned an early tenure at Princeton. I've won national prizes. I've been cited by the U.S. Supreme Court. And I love America. And if you haven't noticed, I'm black.
LEVIN: Well, let me ask you some questions and that is a fantastic background. You see what's been going on in this country. You've seen the, the voices on television and heard them. Athletes, the Commissioner of NFL, Hollywood, the Democratic Party on the left, Pelosi and Schumer.
First of all, I want to ask you a question. Is this a Civil Rights Movement like the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s that had a specific agenda on equality, voting access, due process, whereas this seems to be, as I say, an insurrection that has as its purpose, the overthrow of the original principles of our government and the overthrow of our economic system? What do you make of this?
SWAIN: I think of it -- it's part of the cultural Marxist agenda against America and many of the protesters that are out there, the corporations that are given money, I believe that they are sincere, that they believe that racism in America isn't tolerable, that it hasn't improved, and that black people live their lives in fear. That's a false narrative.
And I think it's being push this year because of the election, and I think that the situation with George Floyd that the media, the Democratic Party, Antifa, Black Lives Matter -- all of those groups had an incentive to push and fan the flames so that they -- so that they ended up with what we are experiencing right now.
So, we are all suffering as a result of their political agenda, and it will not bring us closer together.
LEVIN: You know, Dr. Swain, I look at this, and I have to say you look at these cities, they've been run by one party with an iron fist. Mayor, City Councils, Aldermen for half a century at least. They're in charge of the money that comes into these communities. They're in charge of how it is distributed.
That money is laundered through their bureaucracy, their nepotism, their political cronyism. They take no responsibility for what's going on in their cities. They blame other people. They blame systemic racism.
Same with these one state, excuse me, one party states -- these Democratic states. And it is amazing to me because you have Nancy Pelosi this week who announced that she wants to remove 11 Confederate statues from Congress and I'm thinking to myself, Dr. Swain, hadn't she been there like 30 years?
She's been Speaker twice. She was there when the Democrats controlled the House and the Senate, and Barack Obama was President and only now she decides to remove 11 Confederate statues.
Number one, what is that going to do for the people in these communities? And number two, isn't it for her purely opportunism because she had every opportunity to remove those statues years ago?
SWAIN: Well first of all, I'd like for your viewers to know that I was a Democrat up until 2009, but I always had a different perspective on the world. I've always been able to see through things. And so I've known that the Democratic Party was problematic, but I was there, and I've been able to watch them over the years.
And it's clear that this whole movement to tear down monuments, I believe it's really focused on dividing the country even further, because the monuments are part of our history. If we can't learn from my history, then we're in trouble.
And the whole situation is problematic because with the monuments, this is something that -- there are monuments on all sides. If we start tearing down the monuments, what happens tomorrow when the leaders that we are celebrating today, when those people fall out of favor, it's the wrong path for our nation. It's divisive. It's opportunism. And it's just meant to stir up people that are traditionalist, people that love America, people that are patriotic.
LEVIN: I think you're right. The notion that we're going to now tear down all of the Confederate statues because Americans worship these generals. Americans don't worship these generals, Americans mostly despise these generals. They don't even know who the hell they are.
And the fact is, you're going to start pulling down monuments. What comes next? Any of the Founding Fathers who owned slaves and released slaves? What comes next? Books? We already know movies are being affected. Television shows are being pulled off the air.
We have this kind of bizarre purging going on. This cleaning up of history going on, when in fact, we actually need to know all of these things as we go into the future. Correct?
SWAIN: It's far more important to look at the full picture and not to judge the past by the political correct lens that we use today.
LEVIN: Yes, because if we judge the past by the political lens of today, as you point out, then we have a lot of questions asked of the left and the Democratic Party, don't we?
For instance --
SWAIN: Yes.
LEVIN: How could you have voted for Robert Byrd to be the Democratic Party Majority Leader in the United States Senate when he had been an avowed Klansmen several decades before? That seems to me to be a rational question. Or how could Joe Biden have worked with out of the closet segregationists in the 1970s on various Crime Bills and other issues if we're supposed to cleanse history?
Are we supposed to ignore that too? Or may I say this to your, Professor. The Democratic Party, if we're going to purge society of all vestiges of slavery and segregation and racism, was it not the Democratic Party that led the Confederacy? Was not the Democratic Party that gave birth to the Klan? Was it not the Democratic Party that throughout a hundred years after the Civil War, led the effort on segregation and Jim Crow and poll taxes and literacy tests?
I understand the Democratic Party has done some good things. But if it's in our DNA, and we are systemically racist, and we're pulling down statues, and we're burning books, and we're removing TV shows, why don't we purge the Democratic Party? Just a rhetorical point to you, Professor.
SWAIN: I agree and the Democratic Party also fought against the anti- lynching laws, and if you look at the 1960s, the Democrats have been manipulating black people for a long time, and they pay off the leaders.
They pick certain ones in the black community, they pay them off and nothing good trickles down to the masses.
The Democratic Party has stood in the way black progress. It is standing in the way right now. And they are using black people to advance a radical agenda that I believe will be destructive to our nation, that it will hurt all of us and it's hurting us right now.
LEVIN: And you know, when I look at relatively recent history, I look at 1964, the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which was actually quite crucial. You look at the breakdown of the votes in the House of Representatives, 61 percent of Democrats voted for it, 80 percent of Republicans voted for it. In the Senate, which was filibustered, the Democrats 69 percent of Democrats wound up voting for it, 82 percent of Republicans wound up voting for it.
And yet, the Democratic Party today claims to take the lead in dealing with what it calls systemic racism -- systemic racism in society, systemic racism in police departments. That the Democrat Party is going to advance equality.
You have iconic figures in our culture: Oprah Winfrey, LeBron James. You have the Commissioner of the NFL, pretty much, these are all Democrats all promoting the Democratic Party.
Let me circle back. So, is this in many respects, about power and not so much about Civil Rights?
SWAIN: It's absolutely about power, and if you go to the Black Lives Matter website, and you click on the link to donate, that money is going to Democratic candidates. It's not really advancing the cause of black people.
And I think that it's very problematic that the true statement, the slogan that Black Lives Matter, in the same way that all lives matter, that because the slogan, Black Lives Matter is a true statement, people that want to help blacks and they are white, they're being shamed. They feel like the only way they can show support is to donate money or to acquiesce or get down on their knees before black people, and that's not going to benefit the black community.
And this whole move to defund the police, I mean that's ludicrous. That will hurt black people more than any other group.
LEVIN: All right, thank you. We'll be right back.
LEVIN: Welcome back. Dr. Carol Swain, I want to ask you a few questions. You're very experienced. You've lived what people like to theorize about. You are an example of the American dream.
When you hear of people who haven't lived the way you have lived in the media, sportscaster, sports, Hollywood talk about a systemically racist society, and so many of them do not live in these communities. Maybe some of them came from these communities. They're in the top one-one hundredth percent of the income group.
They live in these communities that are quote-unquote ""systemically racist."" They send their kids to schools in these communities that are quote-unquote ""systemically racist.""
I'm talking about media figures, sports figures, and so forth. Does that kind of hypocrisy -- again, somebody like you who's come out of an inner city environment -- does that kind of hypocrisy frustrate you?
SWAIN: Well, the poverty that I came out of was a rural poverty. And what I've noticed, you know, as a student and as a faculty member, is that a lot of people who have been privileged, whether they're white, black, or Hispanic, the more privileged they are, the more they feel the need, you know, to use that language of systemic racism and I think it's being driven by guilt.
They feel guilty because they're prospering. And it's very problematic to me that the people who make public policy, a lot of them have degrees from Ivy League schools, they went to Ivy League schools and prep schools. They know nothing about the topics they're trying to solve.
So, they -- maybe they did research. They were in a PhD program. They wrote a dissertation. That's the extent of their knowledge and they're going to make public policy for the nation? That's one of the reasons that we are in trouble. And all of these theories that they put forth, the critical theory, critical feminist theory, critical race theory -- all of that is rooted in Marxism and it's a false narrative, and it has no relationship to truth or reality.
LEVIN: And this word Marxism, the fact is the Antifa group, which has done enormous damage to inner city communities over the last couple of weeks is a Marxist anarchist group. The media pretends that they don't exist or they downplay the role.
Black Lives Matter in many respects is a very violent group and an anti- Semitic group, at least during its founding, it is part of the BDS Movement. That's never mentioned. People say they stand with Black Lives Matter.
We stand for the lives of black people and all people. We do not necessarily -- the world -- certainly not I -- stand with this organization per se.
Let me ask you this. School choice. Education is key. Education has been key throughout your life. You're a highly educated woman. In our inner cities, the kind of choice that we have in the rest of the country does not exist.
We have an all-powerful labor union, a public sector union called the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers. They are tied at the hip with the Democratic Party. They are huge donors to the Democratic Party, nearly exclusively and they work hand in glove.
Barack Obama was one of the most outspoken and ardent opponents of school choice, which would allow for America -- the parents of poor kids, especially in violent communities or in communities with bad schools and minority communities to choose working quality schools to send their kids rather than the school down the street if it's not functioning properly, and allows competition -- parochial schools, private schools, charter schools and so forth. Well, the money follows the student just as the money follows the students in college.
This to me is a huge Human and Civil Rights issue -- basic education. The NBA is not behind it. The NFL is not behind it. The media are not behind it. Hollywood's not behind it. The Democratic Party like so often in our history is obstructing it.
And they talk about the cops unions. What about the teachers unions? What's your take on this?
SWAIN: Well, I can tell you that they public opinion polls that I've seen majorities of blacks and Hispanics want school choice and it makes a lot of sense because the people who are making decisions for them, they have school choice.
And in those inner city schools, they are crime ridden. Students are afraid to go to school because of the, quote, ""restorative justice"" rooted in Marxism, and it is making it almost impossible for students to be suspended.
And in cities that are run by Democrats, they have not gotten rid of that. And so there's lawlessness within the schoolhouse. The teachers are afraid to teach. There's chaos in school, just like it is on the streets.
And I think that that's very problematic, and we need school choice, and we need to hold public schools accountable, and whenever Democratic cities want money, they say we have to pay our teachers more. They use the teachers but a lot of that money never reaches the teachers. It's used for administrative purposes.
LEVIN: The problem is in these Democratic cities, they have an economic model that is more socialist than capitalist.
SWAIN: Yes.
LEVIN: They have an all-powerful bureaucracy and they do not allow these kids to get a proper education. The money keeps flowing through the same routes and it does not work. You want true revolutionary change, true drastic reform. You've got to remove these barriers.
The one party rule of the public sector teachers union, and bring in more liberty and opportunity and prosperity and education and choice in the communities that haven't seen it in half a century.
Doctor, I want to thank you very, very much for being on the program and God bless you.
SWAIN: Thank you.
LEVIN: We'll be right back.
ASHLEY STROHMIER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: This is a Fox News Alert. I'm Ashley Strohmier from New York.
The Fulton County Medical Examiner releasing Rayshard Brooks autopsy report listing the cause of death as homicide. According to the report, Brooks died from two gunshot wounds to the back creating organ failure due to blood loss.
Protesters flooding the streets of Atlanta last night, this, following the death of Rayshard Brooks at the hands of police. Brooks had fallen asleep in the drive thru-lane of a Wendy's and failed a field sobriety test. He resisted arrest and took one of the officer's tasers.
As he was running away, Brooks turned back with the taser in hand, an officer shot and killed him. Protesters then set fire to the Wendy's where Brooks had been killed.
In the aftermath, the Atlanta Police Chief has resigned. One officer has been fired and the other placed on administrative duty.
I'm Ashley Strohmier. Now back to LIFE, LIBERTY & LEVIN.
LEVIN: Welcome back. Our next guest, Dr. Wilfred Riley, Associate Professor of Political Science at Kentucky State University. He's written a fantastic book, among others, ""Hate Crime Hoax: How the Left is selling a Fake Race War.""
Well, Professor, you see what's going on around you. You've been commenting on this. So, let me get right to the crux of the matter.
Is there systemic racism in our police departments in the aggregate?
DR. WILFRED RILEY, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE, KENTUCKY STATE UNIVERSITY: Well, systemic or institutional racism as an academic is a phrase that I'm always a bit skeptical of.
Now, obviously, if we want to be honest about some of this country's history, there have been systems like criminal sentencing in the past, where until quite recently, you did see discrimination at kind of a broad group targeted level.
But very often, this phrase simply means there's a difference in performance between two groups, and we're going to attribute that to racism.
And to give an example of why that doesn't necessarily work. I mean, my favorite sports league, the NBA, the National Basketball Association is more than 65 percent black. And I don't think any serious person would believe that that's because white jocks just don't get a fair shake in American society.
The reason is that there's what you might call a cultural variable. African-Americans play basketball more and so on average, at the median, with all due respect to the hit from French Lick, we're better at it. White guys play more baseball, and if you look at MLB that is a very heavily Caucasian and Hispanic athletically.
And you see this same thing in more what you might call serious situations all the time.
So in 1995, the government economist June O'Neill, who is a liberal as I understand, and the conservative researcher, Dinesh D'Souza, who was fairly nonpartisan at the time, looked at the troubling fact that there was a gap between black and white incomes.
As I recall, African-Americans made 82 percent of what Caucasians did. And this was just universally attributed to racism. And what they found out was that that wasn't the case. There were a lot of quote-unquote, variables involved.
African-Americans are a younger population. The most common age for a black man is 27. The most common age for a white man is 58. Obviously, people earn more later in life when they've had the chance to move into executive roles. African-Americans are much more concentrated in the south where wages are lower for everyone.
If you adjust for these factors and just a couple of others, I mean years not even quality of schooling, just staying in school. Average performance on a test like the SAT, the gap almost disappeared.
And you could argue that some of those things are tied into class and whatnot. But there's no pattern of businesses paying an absolutely equally qualified black guy and an absolutely equally qualified white guy different amounts in general.
And I think that's a valuable lesson to take into life. So, when people argue that policing is institutionally racist, almost always what they are saying is, African-Americans are arrested at a higher rate or they encounter police at a higher rate than the black percentage of society would predict.
But the obvious intermediary variable there is crime rate. If you look at the Bureau of Justice Statistics crime report, the African-American crime rate for violent crimes where you encounter the police, whites dominate corporate crime is 2.4 times the white rate.
So, you would expect there unfortunately, to be more encounters between African-Americans and the police. And when you look at this narrative about black people and the police being in constant conflict, not only does a lot of the structural element -- perhaps not all of it, but a great deal -- disappear if you adjust for crime rate.
The figures themselves that are often used strike me as very, very inflated in terms of police violence. So there's a comprehensive database of police shootings and police killings maintained by ""The Washington Post"" newspaper.
There's another one that's kept online and live at www.killedbypolice.net. And if you look at that ""Washington Post"" database, for some reason, the figures change from time to time.
But until about a week ago, the total number of unarmed men killed by police in the USA last year was listed as nine, unarmed black individuals.
Total number of unarmed people, all races, all sexes, was only 56. There were only about a thousand people of all backgrounds armed or unarmed killed by police, and only 229 of those were African-American.
And there's a lot of serious research that looks at types of violence other than just shooting, other than killing.
So, Roland Fryer, who is one of the youngest individuals ever to gain tenure at Harvard, and like me, as a black man took a comprehensive look at every type of police violence in a paper that came out in, I believe 2016.
And what he found is that there were some small gaps. African-Americans were a bit more likely to be, for example, cursed at or lightly shoved. But when it came to extreme beatings or police shootings, African-Americans, in the case of shootings, were actually 24.2 less likely with everything along with race adjusted for, to be shot by the police than whites were.
So, I don't think you see a pattern of broad systemic targeting specifically, of black people by the police today. That doesn't mean there aren't individual bad officers. I mean, we saw the horrifying George Floyd tape. I mean, my position is that charges should be filed against every one of the officers involved in that situation.
But even there, the facts are a little more complex than they originally seemed to be. Two of the officers on the scene as it turns out, Thao and Kueng, if I have the names correct, are not Caucasian men. Floyd and Chauvin, the officer primarily responsible for the killing had previously known one another from a nightlife security position.
So, I don't think we can just look at interactions between African- Americans and the police and say, what we have here is an epidemic pattern of racism, a genocide as Attorney Crump called it in the recent book.
LEVIN: All right. We'll be right back.
LEVIN: Welcome back. Professor Reilly, well based on what you're saying, based on what I'm reading, based on the data, really, police brutality is not the issue that is holding back people in these various communities. What is holding back people in these various communities? And why is the narrative so heavily focused on police brutality?
REILLY: Well, I think that's a very complex question that gets into a lot of things like the difference between historic and contemporary racism.
So first of all, one thing that I would say is that minority communities in the United States have gone through and come through a lot. The black community endured slavery, at least in the south, endured Jim Crow. The crack era and so on down the line.
And you've actually seen some pretty steady closures of gaps between blacks and whites. Just looking at this casually doing some research the other day, I mean, the black SAT rose from about 1,800 as I recall in the 1970s to 950 looking at College Board data just a couple of years ago. So, the black story in America is not a story of tragedy.
But when you look at things that are genuinely problematic in a large scale in the black community, I think you're seeing legacies of racism in the past. You're looking at poverty housing and so on down the line, and even more to the point to me, you're seeing legacies of the 1960s welfare state.
Fatherlessness, for example, is the biggest problem. I'm just going to blame black people here -- the biggest problem among all groups in America.
The great economist Walter Williams in 1938 looked at rates of fatherlessness for whites as I recall, that was under four percent, for African-Americans, it was 11 percent. Those same rates today are 35.4 percent for Caucasians, including Caucasian-Hispanics, over 50 percent, close to 60 percent for Hispanics and Native Americans, 72 percent for African-Americans.
And obviously the presence of a father in particularly a young man's life is one of the biggest predictors of how well he is going to do in High School, how likely he is to go to jail. Things like suicide. That's especially true by the way for lower income Caucasian Americans.
So, I think there are very broad systemic problems in the black community and in many American communities, I would say the collapse of the family and the things associated with this small business community social sector, probably the biggest one.
Why is it so tempting to blame the ghosts of the past? I think, to some extent, two reasons. One, we're used to doing so. And two, there is broad social approval.
So I mean, celebrities, LeBron James, for example, know that if they say the cause of every one of these problems, such as fatherlessness, or the test score gap is racism. One, that is going to be greeted very approvingly by a network of natural allies throughout society. And two, it will sound like something that most people are used to hearing.
But dealing with the actual problems in African-American communities and other communities is going to take more than the eradication of racism. And it's worth noting, by the way that the large majority of people, black and white are not racist in any conventional sense today.
We might look at the results on some complex implicit bias test and be a little worried for a bit, but if you look at actual classic questions, would you vote for a qualified member of the other race for President if they ran with your political party?
The figure for that is 92 percent for African-Americans and for whites. Well over 80 percent of people support interracial dating, marriage love.
So, I don't think we can simply look at an issue like violence in cities and say, well, that's due to racism. One thing you have to point out is that many of the large cities in the United States of America have been controlled by Democratic, often minority led administrations for decades.
So, if there is a problem with the schools in Detroit or with gun violence in the streets, you can't necessarily just say, well, that's the white man.
LEVIN: And also on this interracial issue you raised, I looked at statistics based on a few years back, and it indicated that new marriages, 17 percent or almost one in five are interracial. Now, how can you have systemic racism, when one out of every five marriage is interracial -- and the other statistics you provided?
See, I could be wrong about this. And I'd like to pose this to you for the next segment. This notion of systemic racism means everything and means nothing.
It's an excuse for not addressing the real issues that exist in these communities and other communities. You pointed out one party rule, one party ideology, one party economic ideology. So, there's a battle. There are obstacles to things like school choice that exist in other parts of the country, but not in the inner cities.
You have the Democratic Party that oppose this and as I said earlier in the show, Barack Obama led the battle against the school choice in many of these communities.
And so, if you're going to have truly revolutionary and radical ideas, you have to have competition politically, competition in schools and opportunities. I'd like your thought on that when we return. We'll be right back.
LEVIN: Professor Reilley, how about a liberty agenda? A competition agenda? The sort of environment that exists in so many other parts of the country. It's never discussed. You never hear it discussed by people in the media or in Hollywood, and so forth. How about a real liberty agenda?
REILLY: If you're talking about for the black community, I would fully support that. One thing I will say is that I think that more competition economically and politically would be an excellent thing for the African- American community.
I would love to see the black community split our vote 50/50 because that would imply that both political parties might actually do something for us.
What you see right now is that every four years, with a few exceptions, there are a few long term serving black civil servants, but Democratic politicians come out of the woodwork during election years and make impassioned, racialized pitches to the black community, and this is true no matter who the G.O.P. candidate is.
I mean, when Mitt Romney who is a centrist anti-racist Republican was running for President, Joe Biden's comment about him was he is going to put you all back in chains.
Mitt Romney is not going to bring back slavery, no matter which political party you vote for. He's just not going to. And this year, the exact same line has been used against Donald Trump.
In Political Science, by the way, we find that the mainstream media covered most G.O.P. Presidents as they've covered Donald Trump. The reaction to him isn't a result of his sometimes over the top offensive language, it is also how Romney was discussed, it is how Bush was discussed.
But in regard to Trump, Joe Biden said, ""You ain't black"" to the radio host Charlemagne tha God if you would consider voting for Donald while he's in office. So, I don't think that sort of virtue signaling every four years does much.
Again, obviously racism is real, but today, simply put, the biggest predictor of how successful you become in this country is not residual prejudice around you.
The most successful groups in the country have a competition or a liberty agenda. Nigerian-Americans, Japanese-Americans, East Indian-Americans, Lebanese-Americans, these, not white or black Americans are the wealthiest Americans.
And I would definitely like to see a lot of that agenda transitioned into deprived communities, whether poor white communities or African-American communities, although clearly my focus is on African-American communities.
I'd like to see enterprise zones. I'd like to see charter schools as an option for striving minority parents. HBCUs, a good number of which are private -- I'm proud to teach at one -- do a fair amount of good in this arena, but that's after high school.
But yes, I would like to see as many chances to competitively perform in the hood as there are to competitively perform in the suburbs, and that would do much, much more good for poor people, especially poor black people than the endless ghost hunting for new, more refined forms of racism.
LEVIN: But you do understand what that means. That means trying to figure out how to defeat one party rule in these cities and how to defeat the teachers unions in these cities, and a whole bureaucracy and a whole a group of surrogates that have grown out of these -- these one party rule cities. That that's going to be very difficult.
REILLY: Yes, just very quickly. Public sector unions in general, to me, as a businessman and an academic are problematic. Private sector unions are great.
With public sector unions, you don't really have two parties coming to the table. You have the union made up of middle class employees and executives in the public sector and then you have the politicians to whom these unions give sizable donations. Those are the two parties negotiating and those are not two distinct parties.
By the way, in terms of real solutions to the issues of policing, a lot of those would involve tackling police unions. You sometimes hear that Camden got rid of the police. No, they didn't. What they did was break the police union, give cops some basic training in related fields like social work and change their name, but they have 70 percent more boots on the ground in terms of what in practice police officers than they used to.
So, the more you can take on these public sector unions to achieve things like actual body cameras in every department, a discussion about no knock raids, removing these various complex forms of immunity from contracts, perhaps I'd like to hear officers reactions to that, the better you'll see -- the better a relationship between police and the communities they serve, you will see.
LEVIN: All right, Professor. I want to thank you very, very much. You've been extremely edifying. And God bless you.
REILLY: You as well.
LEVIN: We'll be right back.
LEVIN: Welcome back. You know, America is a great country with great people. Massive diversity, where the vast majority of us get along, but there are forces in this country, political, and others that seek the divide us. This idea that America is systemically racist is a big lie.
The purpose of the flag and the National Anthem is to unite the country. The people who attack it, don't seek to unite the country.
Let's go through history very quickly in the minutes that I have left.
We had a Civil War that began in 1861. Over 800,000 casualties. That would be the equivalent today of over eight million casualties. And over half of those were soldiers and others fighting for the North, to keep the union together and to end slavery. No nation on the face of the Earth has ever undertaken such an effort.
In 1863, we have the Emancipation Proclamation. President Lincoln freeing the slaves throughout the country, particularly the south. We had 1865, the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery. The states ratified the 13th Amendment.
We had the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and 1871. The Enforcement Act of 1870. The Force Act of 1871 -- all intended to advance the cause of integration. With the KKK Act and the Civil Rights Act of 1875.
In 1868, the 14th Amendment was ratified by the states. It abolishes, not only did it abolish slavery, it guarantees due process and equal protection of all citizens, especially freed African slaves. In 1870, the 15th Amendment guarantees the right to vote for all citizens.
Now, the implementation of this became problematic because of the Democratic Party and racist elements, not just in the south and in the north that didn't believe in reconstruction after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln and after Ulysses S. Grant left office, and so there have been many efforts since then, including by our courts, our national legislatures and our state legislature.
You have in 1954, the Brown versus Board of Education decision, nine to zero, reversing parts of Plessy versus Ferguson. It ended legal racial segregation in schools. In 1962, Bailey versus Patterson ends desegregation and transportation.
In the 1964 Civil Rights Act passed by the overwhelming majority of Republicans in the House and the Senate and majorities of the Democrats in both prohibits discrimination in voting, public accommodations, public facilities, public education, Federal assistance programs and employment and established the EEOC or the 1965 Voting Rights Act that prohibited denial or restriction of the right to vote. It forbids discriminatory voting practices nationwide.
In 1967, you had the Loving versus Virginia Act declaring state laws prohibiting interracial marriage to be unconstitutional.
Going back, in 1953, Dwight Eisenhower instituted rules that eliminated discrimination in government contracting. He desegregated Federal government in the nation's capital. In 1957, the Civil Rights Act of 1957, it created the Civil Rights Commission. It created the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice.
In 1957 and 1959, Eisenhower ordered desegregation of the Washington, D.C. public schools.
We have the Insurrection Act that was amended in 1871 to allow the use of military to enforce among other things, Civil Rights and desegregation. In 1871, Ulysses S. Grant sent a thousand soldiers to hunt down Klansmen in South Carolina and they captured 600 of them.
In 1957, Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne Division to Little Rock to protect nine black students entering Little Rock Central High School against the order of the Governor at the time, Orville Faubus, one of Bill Clinton's mentors, by the way.
In 1962, John Kennedy federalized the National Guard to allow a black student to enroll in classes at the University of Mississippi-Oxford.
In 1965, LBJ federalized the National Guard to protect Civil Rights marches headed for Selma to Montgomery.
This -- I'm just touching the tip of the iceberg.
The number of economic programs, the trillions of dollars and so forth, don't tell me this country is systemically racist. If this country were systemically racist, none of this would have taken place. None of this would be taking place.
We, Americans are good people, regardless of our race, regardless of our religion, regardless of our sex, regardless of the politicians who try to divide us, the media who try to divide us, these so-called cultural icons who try to divide us.
We're an imperfect people in an imperfect country, but it is the greatest country in the face of the Earth. Just ask most of those who are on TV who are in sports or in Hollywood, who trash it day in and day out.
If you want real revolutionary, dramatic reforms, including in our inner cities, then abandon the old economic practices, allow choice, allow liberty to take place in these communities.
They're ruled by one party -- iron fisted control. And the politicians that run these towns, as far as I'm concerned are corrupt right up to here.
Anyway, thank you for joining me tonight on LIFE, LIBERTY & LEVIN and I'll see you next time."

One could be forgiven for thinking that rhetorical dynamism long ago vanished from the hallways and chambers of the United States Congress. It has been a hundred and sixty-four years, for example, since Charles Sumner, the anti-slavery Republican from Massachusetts, rose in the humid air of the Old Senate Chamber to unleash a five-hour, fully memorized onslaught against the idea of Kansas joining the Union as a slave state. Along the way, Sumner paused to lash two of his Senate colleagues, calling Stephen Douglas, of Illinois, a ""noisome, squat, and nameless animal,"" and accusing Andrew Butler, of South Carolina, of taking up with a ""polluted"" mistress—""I mean the harlot, Slavery."" You can still hear such acidic flourishes in other legislatures around the globe, but the language of the U.S. Congress is rarely so vivid. Generally, it is as flavorless as day-old gum.
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a first-term Democrat from New York, provided a rare exception Thursday as she stepped to the microphone in the House chamber to make a hash of Ted Yoho, a veterinarian, Tea Party member, and veteran Republican from Florida.
The story began earlier this week, when Yoho reportedly approached Ocasio-Cortez on the Capitol steps to inform her that she was, among other things, ""disgusting"" and ""out of your freaking mind."" His analysis was directed at her (hardly novel) public statements that poverty and unemployment are root causes of the recent spike in crime rates in New York. On matters of criminal-justice reform, Yoho is of a decidedly conservative bent. Not long ago, he voted against making lynching a federal hate crime, saying that such a law would be a regrettable instance of federal ""overreach.""
According to a reporter for The Hill, Yoho did not cease in his expressive disdain for Ocasio-Cortez even as she walked away. Once he believed her to be out of hearing range, Yoho reportedly described his colleague as a ""fucking bitch.""
On Wednesday, once the news of the encounter had circulated, Yoho delivered a statement that could best be described as the sort of non-apology apology that begins, ""I am sorry if you understood me to be saying. . . ."" Yoho began by explaining that he wanted ""to apologize for the abrupt manner of the conversation I had with my colleague from New York.""
But his remorse was, at best, confined. ""No one was accosted, bullied, or attacked,"" he went on. ""This was a brief policy discussion, plain and simple, and we have our differences. . . . The fact still remains, I am not going to apologize for something I didn't say."" With confused logic, Yoho invoked his wife and daughters and said that he objected to Ocasio-Cortez's views because he had experienced poverty when he was young. ""I cannot apologize for my passion or for loving my God, my family, and my country,"" he said. It was unclear who had asked him to apologize for his religious faith, his patriotism, or his love of family, but he was ardent all the same.
In all, Yoho's was at best a deflective, jittery performance that was in no wise enhanced by his spokesman, Brian Kaveney, who e-mailed the Washington Post to say that Yoho ""did not call Rep. Ocasio-Cortez what has been reported in the Hill or any name for that matter. . . . Instead, he made a brief comment to himself as he walked away summarizing what he believes her policies to be: bulls-.""
As a first-termer, Ocasio-Cortez has been a star, even if she has had her stumbles, including an initially troubled relationship with the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi. Ocasio-Cortez has been at the forefront of major issues, including climate change, immigration, campaign-finance reform, and income inequality. Her ability to skewer a balky witness in committee hearings has proved as uncanny as it is entertaining. She came to the House floor Thursday to rebut Yoho, insisting that, after delivering a short retort via Twitter, she might have kept her counsel had he not delivered such a lame non-apology. Her speech, which was then echoed by other colleagues from the Democratic caucus, was not in the Charles Sumner category in either length or style—she favored righteous sincerity where Sumner employed florid invective—but the devastation was of a similar scale. The sporting equivalent might be Billie Jean King's measured yet unmistakable destruction of Bobby Riggs. The video of Ocasio-Cortez's speech is available online, of course; it should be studied for its measured cadence, its artful construction, and its refusal of ugliness.
She began with narrative, setting the scene: ""I was minding my own business, walking up the steps, and Representative Yoho put his finger in my face. He called me 'disgusting.' He called me 'crazy.' He called me 'out of my mind.' And he called me 'dangerous.' "" Then she broadened her scope: ""This issue is not about one incident. It is cultural. It is a culture of lack of impunity, of accepting violence and violent language against women and an entire structure of power that supports that."" Ocasio-Cortez made it clear that she was not going to fall down and faint. She had heard it all before, on the subway and as a bartender. But she wasn't going to let this pass, not from a fellow-member of Congress: ""I could not allow my nieces, I could not allow the little girls that I go home to, I could not allow victims of verbal abuse, and worse, to see that. To see that excuse, and see our Congress accept it as legitimate and accept it as an apology and to accept silence as a form of acceptance. I could not allow that to stand."" What's more, she was not going to allow Yoho, in his clumsy way, to use his family as a ""shield"" for his barrage.
""Having a daughter does not make a man decent. Having a wife does not make a decent man. Treating people with dignity and respect makes a decent man. And when a decent man messes up, as we all are bound to do, he tries his best and does apologize,"" she said. ""I am someone's daughter, too.""
The politics of our moment are dominated by a bully of miserable character, a President who has failed to contain a pandemic through sheer indifference, who has fabricated a reëlection campaign based on bigotry and the deliberate inflammation of division. His language is abusive, his attitude toward women disdainful. Trump is all about himself: his needs, his ego, his self-preservation. Along the way he has created a Republican Party in his own image. Imitators like Ted Yoho slavishly follow his lead. On the House floor Thursday, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez exemplified a different sort of character. She defended not only herself; she defended principle and countless women. And all in just a few short minutes on the floor of the House of Representatives.

Connecting an unhinged rant by a tech CEO in California against a family, as well as violence across the country, reporter Elaine Quijano suggested that Trump highlighting the coronavirus's origin may have something to do with spreading bigotry.After showing video of the Orosa family in California being screamed at in a restaurant, Quijano explained, 'According to the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, there have been more than 2,100 reported hate incidents against Asian Americans since the start of the pandemic. More than 800 of those were reported in California.'She then played a clips of Trump saying, 'It comes from China. That's why. Kung flu. This terrible China virus.' The journalist talked to Cynthia Choi, the co-executive Director of Chinese for Affirmative Action. She blamed, 'I mean, look at these first ten accounts of anti-Asian hate, Trump's name is evoked.'Indeed, tech CEO Michael Lofthouse did invoke Trump during his hateful rant. But that makes the President responsible? He's repeatedly said and tweeted things like this:

CBS This Morning 7/9/2020 7:41 AM ETVLAD DUTHIERS: There's been a rise of hate crimes and racist attacks against Asian Americans since the corona pandemic began. Cell phone video captured one of the most recent incidents. A man yelled racial slurs at a California family while they were at a birthday dinner. He later apologized. Elaine Quijano of our streaming network CBS N spoke with the family that was targeted. Elaine, what did they say?ELAINE QUIJANO: Well, Vlad, the Orosa family is shaken by what happened. It almost didn't get recorded because of the family's no-phone rule for their celebration dinner. But when a man began harassing them, one of the relatives pulled out their phone and started recording. Raymond Orosa and his wife Marie were celebrating Marie's birthday and the Fourth of July at a restaurant in California when Orosa said his family became a target.[Footage of man yelling at family.]QUIJANO: Cell phone video shows tech CEO Michael Lofthouse yelling racial slursMICHAEL LOFTHOUSE: Fucking Asian pieces of [bleeped]. QUIJANO: Oroso and his wife were born in the Philippines. He said they have been U.S. Citizens for roughly two decades. How did you feel when he said those things to you?RAYMOND OROSA: I never felt anything like it. But that that sort of for the first time was pretty strong. I didn't know what to do.QUIJANO: Other recent harassment or hate crimes against Asian Americans include a stabbing at a Sam's Club in Midland, Texas, and an attack on a New York City subway. The FBI predicted the upswing in March, warning law enforcement that harassment of Asian Americans may increase amid the coronavirus. More than three months later, the numbers are surfacing. According to the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, there have been more than 2,100 reported hate incidents against Asian Americans since the start of the pandemic. More than 800 of those were reported in California.CYNTHIA CHOI: About 70 percent is what we would constitute verbal harassment.QUIJANO: Cynthia Choi is co-executive Director of Chinese for Affirmative Action. She says hundreds of hate crimes are topically reported every year. Not thousands.DONALD TRUMP: It comes from China. That's why. Kung flu. This terrible China virus.QUIJANO: Choi believes there's a connection between rhetoric from the presidential podium to real-world expressions of bias.CHOI: I mean, look at these first ten accounts of anti-Asian hate, Trump's name is evoked.QUIJANO: Just like it was last weekend in California. In a statement to several media outlets, Lofthouse apologized saying, ""My behavior in the video is appalling. This was clearly a moment where I lost control and made incredibly hurtful and divisive comments."" Do you accept his apology?OROSA: Yes, I do forgive. I've done wrong things, too. And I've been forgiven. And but in no way am I agreeing to what he's done. No. I don't accept the apology.QUIJANO: In a statement to CBS News, the White House says the President has noted on numerous occasions the need to protect the Asian American community but added he will, quote, 'Continue to point to the fact that the origin of the virus is China.' Raymond Orosa told us he has not spoken to Michael Lofthouse directly. When I asked what he would say to the CEO if he had a chance to speak to him, Orosa said he just wants to ask him why. Tony?TONY DOKOUPIL: Yeah, I think why is the question we're all asking. The FBI anticipated this increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans. We should reflect today on why it's happening.

 Democratic party's Presidential candidate Joe Biden on Tuesday picked Harris as his running mate, recognising the crucial role Black voters could play in his determined bid to defeat President Donald Trump in the US presidential election.
 The 55-year-old California senator, whose father is from Jamaica and mother an Indian, becomes just the third woman to be selected as the Vice-President on a major party ticket. Then-Alaska Governor Sarah Palin in 2008 and New York Representative Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 were the other two.
 In a statement, the Association of Indian Muslims of America (AIM) congratulated Harris on her nomination and lauded the Indian-American community for its extraordinary success in the face of tough competition in US in just about five decades.
 Kaleem Kawaja, the executive director of AIM, expressed joy at the remarkable high success of a second generation Indian-American in becoming a candidate for the second highest public office in America. 
 Harris is the daughter of Prof Shyamala Gopalan, a cancer biologist, who was from Chennai, India, and had emigrated to US in 1965. 
 Welcoming the addition of Harris to the Democratic presidential ticket, Rajwant Singh, Chairman of the Sikh Council on Religion and Education and Senior Adviser to National Sikh Campaign, said that it is a great step for such as major party to add someone from the minorities for the national office in America. It means a great to deal to blacks, women and to all immigrants, he said.
 ""We are thankful to both Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for reminding Americans about the 8th anniversary of the shooting at Sikh Gurdwara in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, just a few days ago. We need more of our political leaders to be forthcoming on these critical issues of gun violence and hate crimes facing America,"" Singh said.
 Harris being on the national ticket opens the door for many people from all minority communities to aspire to lead this great nation, Singh added. "

Trump has admittedly downplayed the seriousness[1] of the coronavirus that has taken 214,000 American lives with hundreds more dying every day. Although Trump contracted the virus[2] and was hospitalized[3] because of it, he continues to lessen its gravity, a fact with which Murdoch is appalled. 
'Look, you do worry about it and I think that we're in the middle of a public health crisis,' Murdoch told The New York Times'[4] Maureen Dowd in an interview posted Saturday. 'Climate is also a public health crisis. Whatever political spin on that, if it gets in the way of delivering crucial public health information, I think is pretty bad.' Also Read: James Murdoch Admits He Won't Watch 'Succession'[5] Murdoch said that although, as a businessman, he understands that 'companies have a responsibility to their customers and their communities' and 'that responsibility shouldn't be compromised by political point scoring,' he does call Trump comparing COVID-19 to the flu since day one 'craziness.' 'I'm just concerned that the leadership that we have, to me, just seems characterized by callousness and a level of cruelty that I think is really dangerous and then it infects the population,' he said of the Trump administration. 'It's not a coincidence that the number of hate crimes in this country are rising over the last three years for the first time in a long time.' Although his family owns hundreds of publishing and news outlets around the world, including The Wall Street Journal, The New York Post and Fox News, the youngest Murdoch man says he doesn't watch Fox — quite a surprise, considering the network has been prominent in the spreading of Trump's messages.Related stories from TheWrap: James Murdoch Admits He Won't Watch 'Succession'[6]Rupert Murdoch and Lachlan Murdoch Both Made a Lot Less Money in 2020 Than 2019[7]James Murdoch Resigns From News Corp.

ATLANTA — A 16-year-old white girl was orchestrating an elaborate, racially motivated plot to attack a small black congregation outside Atlanta, but the scheme was foiled after her classmates reported it to a high school counselor, the authorities said Tuesday.
The authorities said the girl, who had assembled a collection of butcher knives and other straight-edged weapons, may have been inspired by the massacre in 2015 at a storied African-American church in Charleston, S.C., carried out by an unrepentant white supremacist. 
The police found out about the plot after high school students in Gainesville, Ga., confided to a counselor that a classmate had a notebook containing “detailed plans” for killing congregants at Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church, the authorities said. School officials reported it to the authorities on Friday.
“Our investigation indicated the church was targeted by the juvenile based on the racial demographic of the church members,” Chief Jay Parrish of the Gainesville Police Department said in a statement on Tuesday.
The student, who was not identified by the authorities, was charged with criminal intent to commit murder, the police said. She was being held on Tuesday in a juvenile detention facility.
Police officials said that the girl visited the church last Wednesday evening, a time when Bible study is usually held. “Through divine intervention or whatever you want to call it, they weren’t having services that evening,” Sgt. Kevin Holbrook, a spokesman for the Gainesville police, said in an interview. 
It was not clear whether she was planning to carry out the attack that evening, he said, or gathering information for later use.
“We are thankful to God that this plot was stopped before anybody was either killed or injured,” Bishop Reginald T. Jackson, the presiding prelate for the African Methodist Episcopal Church’s more than 500 congregations in Georgia, told reporters in his office in Atlanta. 
The Bethel congregation, which has about 40 members, worships in a small white sanctuary perched on a corner in a residential neighborhood of Gainesville, a city of about 40,000 people an hour’s drive northeast of Atlanta. The African Methodist Episcopal denomination was one of the first Protestant churches created by black people, and has several thousand congregations around the country.
The Rev. Dr. Michelle Rizer-Pool, Bethel’s pastor, said that she went to the church to pray as soon as she heard of the plot last week. And on Sunday, she said, she comforted her congregation, who were stunned and hurt by the news.
“I tried to let them know, let us not be afraid,” she said, adding that she sought to impress upon them that “God is with us.”
The plot has been an unwelcome reminder of the massacre on June 17, 2015, at Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston, the denomination’s oldest congregation in the Deep South and one with a rich two-century history of resisting slavery and supporting the civil rights movement. 
In that attack, a 21-year-old white man fueled by racial hatred sat through Bible study and then opened fire, killing nine people. The gunman, who was condemned to death by a federal jury in 2017, wrote in a jailhouse manifesto that he “would rather live in prison knowing I took action for my race than live with the torture of sitting idle.” 
Law enforcement officials have said they believe that the Charleston attack, which rattled the nation, has incited would-be imitators, like a 29-year-old South Carolina man in 2017 who told an undercover federal agent, from whom he was buying a handgun, that he had plans inspired by the Charleston gunman. 
And in the case announced on Tuesday, Sergeant Holbrook said the Charleston attack “does appear to have played some type of role in this.”
News of the plot renewed fears about the security at houses of worship, including churches and synagogues, which have beentargeted repeatedly in recent years. It came at a time when hate crimes have been increasing, reaching a 16-year high last year, according to federal crime data.
“I want to be wrong,” Bishop Jackson said, “but these kinds of incidents, unfortunately, have a way of encouraging others who share the same ideology.”
Church officials said they would urge prosecutors to charge the girl as an adult, saying that the plot was not the product of a “childish mind.” The district attorney whose jurisdiction includes Gainesville did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment on Tuesday.
“We love her — we’re going to pray for her,” Bishop Jackson said. But he added that the situation brought to mind a lesson he has preached many times: “For every decision you make, there’s consequences.”

Then last year, she decided to step into the public eye with a memoir pointedly called ""Know My Name."" It went on to become a New York Times bestseller. And now she`s making her way as young artist living right here in New York City. We caught up with her to find out how her life has changed.
(Begin VT)
VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: You move to New York City in the middle of a pandemic. What has that been like for you?
CHANEL MILLER: I`m very familiar with the trees in my neighborhood. I`ve, you know, developed deep grooves in the sidewalks from walking the same loops. But when I was writing the book I was alone at home for three years without any co-workers and without anyone knowing that I was at home. So I felt like, okay, I`ve been here before. But the difference for me now is that I`m not as mentally isolated, because this time people are aware of who I am and what I`m doing. And I also think I was forced to live in a suspended state of uncertainty for a really long time. I waited a year and a half to get that verdict. And I had to just keep reassuring myself that no matter the outcome, I would figure out a way to be okay. And right now that`s something we`re all learning how to do. And I hope that people don`t us-- underestimate that as a skill.
VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: It`s been nearly a year since you revealed your identity. What`s it like now that the entire world knows your name?
CHANEL MILLER: I`m really grateful that before lockdown happened, I was able to have a few book signings, and finally meet people face-to-face and experience that warmth directly. You know, people would line up and write their names on Post-it notes in the book so that I could sign them. And I`ve kept every single one, because I`m meeting the people who have saved me.
VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: You know, when you were growing up it was hard to find representation. It`s made it hard for you to identify with your Asian heritage. Talk to me a little bit more about that.
CHANEL MILLER: Yeah. I mean, growing up, I didn`t see people who look like me on prominent screens. And even before I started doing interviews last year, I kept questioning if I truly belonged in these prominent seats. But then I thought, maybe it`s because I`m not used to seeing people like me sitting there. And so that`s why it feels so unnatural. So if I do it maybe it`ll become more natural for someone else who looks like me.
VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: In the wake of the coronavirus, there have been-- there`s been an uptick in attacks on Asians, but specifically in this country on Asian-Americans. Have you experienced any of that?
CHANEL MILLER: Well, first, I want to say that it`s important to note that it`s not new. It`s more physical and frequent and aggressive, but it`s not new. And if you speak to any Asian-American, they can list out micro- aggressions they`ve experienced since childhood, and insulting, racist comments. We can`t tolerate this anymore, especially now when the hate crimes are getting more violent and pervasive. We`re not going to sit back.
VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: You write that your art is what helped you get through some of the darkest periods of your life. And now you are creating art and exhibiting art. What does that feel like?
CHANEL MILLER: I think a lot about how when I was in court, it`s a place that`s completely devoid of art. And that was difficult for me. You know, art has immense power to nourish people, and to also address your hu-- humanity, saying, you know, just to give someone something nice to look at. So that was important to me. And now what`s incredible is that the Asian Art Museum has given me a seventy-five-foot wall.
VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: That`s amazing.
CHANEL MILLER: Yeah. And it`s something that I never would`ve asked for or thought to ask for, say, hey, can I fill that wall? So the fact that they brought me to the museum, stood me on the street before this massive wall and said, this is yours. Again, that`s restructuring how I see myself, and also telling me how much space I deserve to take up in the world. And that`s what I hope people feel when they go there and see it.

MICHELLE MILLER: Hm.

And during that victim impact statement that she read in court, she talked about being with everybody, being with little girls, being with people who are not believed. She was with them. And you heard her say to me that now it`s come full circle, that the folks around her who have come to see her, who have come and have read her book, she is supported by them.
ANTHONY MASON: Yeah.
MICHELLE MILLER: Survivors` voices are so important to hear.
ANTHONY MASON: Yeah.
MICHELLE MILLER: And it`s so good to hear hers.

With Democrats boycotting the hearing, the Republican-­controlled Senate Judiciary Committee voted to authorize the legal orders if Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter's Jack Dorsey do not agree to testify voluntarily. 
The committee wants to hear from them about ""the suppression and/or censorship of two news articles from the New York Post,"" according to the subpoena document. Senators also want information from the executives about their companies' policies for moderating content ""that may interfere"" with federal elections. 
A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment. Twitter representatives didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Facebook and Twitter acted last week to limit the online dissemination and sharing of an unverified political story from the conservative-leaning New York Post that targeted Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. The story, which other publications have not confirmed, cited unverified emails from Biden's son Hunter that were reportedly disclosed by President Trump's allies. 
One email purported to show a top adviser for Burisma, the Ukraine gas company where Hunter Biden held a board seat, thanking Biden for giving him an opportunity to meet the elder Biden, who was vice president at the time. 
Trump's campaign seized on the report, though the account raised more questions than answers, including whether emails at the center of the story were hacked or fabricated. 
It was the first time in recent memory that the two social media platforms enforced rules against misinformation on a story from a mainstream media publication. 
With the Nov. 3 election looming, Facebook and Twitter have scrambled to stem the tide of material seen as potentially inciting violence and spreading disinformation and baseless conspiracy theories. Facebook has expanded its restrictions on political advertising, including new bans on messages claiming widespread voter fraud. Trump has raised the prospect of mass fraud in the vote-by-mail process. 
The companies also have wrestled with how strongly they should intervene in speech on their platforms. 
With Trump leading the way, conservatives have stepped up their claims that Facebook, Twitter and Google, which owns YouTube, are biased, charging without evidence Silicon Valley's social media platforms are deliberately suppressing conservative views. 
The Justice Department has asked Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms. 
Trump signed an executive order this year challenging the protections from lawsuits under a 1996 telecommunications law that has served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet. 
The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation, on a bipartisan vote, recently authorized subpoenas for Zuckerberg, Dorsey and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. The three have agreed to testify for a hearing planned for next week. 
Democrats have focused their criticism of social media mainly on hate speech, misinformation and other content that they say can incite violence or keep people from voting. They have criticized the CEOs for failing to police content, focusing on the platforms' role in hate crimes and the rise of white nationalism in the United States. 
In 2017, following the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, tech giants began banning extremist groups and individuals espousing white supremacist views and support for violence. Facebook extended the ban to white nationalists. 
From both political parties, the companies have come under increasing scrutiny in Washington and from state attorneys general over issues of competition, consumer privacy and hate speech. 
On Tuesday, the Justice Department filed a landmark antitrust case against Google, accusing it of abusing its dominance in online search and advertising to boost profits. It was the government's most significant attempt to protect competition since the groundbreaking case against Microsoft more than 20 years ago. 
Facebook, Amazon and Apple also have been targets of antitrust investigations by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. "

WOLF BLITZER, CNN HOST: We want to welcome our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer in THE SITUATION ROOM.
This hour, President Trump is in Arizona, preparing to hold another indoor campaign event, in defiance of coronavirus concerns, in a state seeing record spikes in new cases and deaths.
His response to the pandemic remains alarming and confusing. He now suggests that he did ask for a slowdown in testing here in the United States, as infections have surged, contradicting the White House spin that he was only kidding.
All this as Dr. Anthony Fauci and other Coronavirus Task Force members have been painting a rather dire picture of the spread of the virus during hours of congressional testimony today, the CDC chief warning that COVID-19 has -- and I'm quoting now -- ""brought this nation to its knees.""
Also breaking, the FBI says it's determined that NASCAR's only African-American star driver was not -- repeat -- not a target of a hate crime. Authorities say a rope fashioned like a noose found in a garage assigned to Bubba Wallace was a door pull that had been there as early as last fall.
First, let's go straight to Arizona and our chief White House correspondent, Jim Acosta.
Jim, as the president prepares for tonight's rally, he's clearly not on the same page as health experts or his own top aides.
JIM ACOSTA, CNN CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Wolf.
President Trump is on his way to a campaign event in Phoenix after visiting his border wall earlier today. The president is in damage control mode, trying to clean up a comment that he told administration officials to slow down testing for the coronavirus. First, aides to the president said he was just joking about that.
Then the president contradicted his own aides by saying he doesn't kid.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
ACOSTA (voice-over): Even after more than 120,000 deaths from the coronavirus in the U.S., the president and his top aides are having a tough time explaining whether Mr. Trump is just kidding or being serious when it comes to testing for COVID-19.
QUESTION: Were you just kidding, or do you have a plan to slow down testing?
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I don't kid. Let me just tell you. Let me make it clear. By having more cases, it sounds bad. But, actually, what it is, we're finding people.
ACOSTA: The president is trying to talk his way out of the mess he started at his rally in Tulsa over the weekend, when he said he's ordered officials to slow down testing.
TRUMP: So, I said to my people, slow the testing down, please.
ACOSTA: White House officials first claimed the president was kidding.
KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: It was a comment that he made in jest.
ACOSTA: Asked about Mr. Trump's comment that he does not kid, Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters on Air Force One: ""He was noting he was making a serious point, but he was using sarcasm to do that at the rally.""
At a hearing in the House, Dr. Anthony Fauci testified, the administration is not dialing back testing.
DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NIAID DIRECTOR: I know for sure, but, to my knowledge, none of us have ever been told to slow down on testing. That just is a fact. In fact, we will be doing more testing.
ACOSTA: But the president's no-kidding claim runs counter to excuses he's used in the past, like when he suggested to Americans that they inject themselves with disinfectant to kill the virus.
TRUMP: When I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute.
ACOSTA: Mr. Trump later said he was kidding.
TRUMP: I was asking a question sarcastically to reporters like you, just to see what would happen.
ACOSTA: Or when he claimed to be chosen by God.
TRUMP: I am the chosen one.
ACOSTA: Mr. Trump tweeted: ""The media knew I was kidding, being sarcastic."" Contrast all of that with the somber warning from Fauci that the coronavirus is surging in some parts of the U.S.
FAUCI: We are now seeing a disturbing surge of infections. Right now, the next couple of weeks are going to be critical in our ability to address those surgings that we are seeing in Florida, in Texas, in Arizona, and in other states.
ACOSTA: That contradicts Mr. Trump's repeated claims the virus is disappearing.
TRUMP: If you look, the numbers are very minuscule compared to what it was. It's dying out.
ACOSTA: The president is visiting Arizona to tour parts of his border wall, the pet project he turns to when he needs to play to his base. Mr. Trump has only managed to build a fraction of the border barrier he sold to voters. Instead of Mexico paying for the wall, as he promised, American taxpayers are picking up the tab.
TRUMP: I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will have Mexico pay for that wall.
ACOSTA: To rev up his supporters, the president is also seizing on the latest destruction left by demonstrators protesting police brutality with threats of jail time, tweeting: ""Numerous people arrested in D.C. for the disgraceful vandalism in Lafayette Park of the magnificent statue of Andrew Jackson, 10 years in prison. Beware.""
TRUMP: We actually had a nice crowd, despite the fact that we had some pretty bad people waiting there waiting. They shouldn't have been.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
ACOSTA: Now, it's no secret why the president is in Arizona.
Polls show former Vice President Joe Biden could win this state. If the president loses Arizona, it is hard to see how he wins a second term in office.
On the coronavirus, the European Union may be about to construct a wall of its own, as E.U. officials are considering blocking American visitors from entering that part of the world due to the surge in COVID-19 cases.
[18:05:09]
Now, back here, here in Arizona, as you can see from this wall behind me, building a fence is easier said than done. Plenty of wall behind us where we're standing right now, but where we are panning over to right now, you can see there is no wall. Crews are working on that stretch as we speak.
And, Wolf, as we mentioned, this is a wall that Mexico is not paying for. Is the American taxpayers -- Wolf.
BLITZER: Yes, indeed.
All right, Jim Acosta in Arizona, thanks very much.
Let's stay in Arizona. Let's go to Phoenix right now, the site of the president's political event that's coming up fairly soon, we're told.
Ryan Nobles is on the scene for us.
Ryan, the city of Phoenix has an ordinance requiring face masks in public. But at this event and the folks behind you, I saw earlier, I didn't see many face masks.
RYAN NOBLES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: No, you're right, Wolf, very few, if any people complying with that ordinance that was passed by the City Council and the mayor not long ago, and it was passed because of a surge in coronavirus cases in the state of Arizona and specifically here in Phoenix.
In fact, there's been very little, if any precautions taken to prevent the spread of coronavirus at this event. The folks that came into this venue that seats about 3,000 people did not get their temperatures checked. There's little to no social distancing and, as you mentioned, Wolf, no masks either.
So, the president expected to be here in about a half-an-hour. There is six feet between him and the crowd, but we are inside a venue where there is a lot of people talking. As you can tell, they're very enthusiastic. There's a lot of cheering.
It's a recipe for what many public health experts say could be a disaster when it comes to the spread of the coronavirus -- Wolf.
BLITZER: Yes, Saturday night, you were in Tulsa, Oklahoma, at that event where there were about 6,200 people in that arena. And we know that six of the president's advance team, campaign advance team, they tested positive. They didn't go to the event in Tulsa.
They were there, two Secret Service agents as well. But two of the campaign advance personnel, they did go to the event, they did test positive. Were their tests before, and are there going to be tests after this event where you are in Phoenix?
NOBLES: It's a good question, Wolf. We haven't been given specific guidance on that, because this particular event, not run by the White House, not run by the Trump campaign, instead being run by a third- party organization called Turning Point Action and their subsidiary called Students For Trump.
So they have not made us aware of any attempts to test folks that are here, the staffers that are associated with it, and those that are going to be surrounding the president. And, as I can tell you before, Wolf, very few people taking any sort of precaution to spread the -- for the potential of the spread of the coronavirus -- Wolf.
BLITZER: Yes, those young people there should all be wearing masks. Even if they think they're not going to get very sick, they could clearly pass it on to their moms and dads, their grandparents and others, if they get this disease.
All right, thanks very much. We will stay in close touch with you, Ryan Nobles, on the scene in Phoenix for us.
Let's bring in our chief political analyst, Gloria Borger, our chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, and our senior political commentator, David Axelrod.
Sanjay, looking at how the United States has handled the virus, does it make sense for the E.U. to now consider a more long-term ban on American travelers trying to get into European countries?
DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it's hard to believe this is a consideration, but there is some logic to it, Wolf.
I mean, just look at the right side of your screen. I mean, out of the world, we represent now 25 percent, roughly, of the world's infections of this coronavirus, and, sadly, 25 percent of the world's deaths as well.
So, that's what's driving the decision, I'm sure. That's the criteria. Other countries as well, such as Brazil and Russia, have also -- they're sort of these hot spots. So that's what's factoring into this.
Having said that, just from a pure public health standpoint, it's not a silver bullet to think about these travel bans. I mean, they can be very disruptive. The World Health Organization is an organization that is generally against them, thinking that the risks outweigh the benefits of these things.
There's other sort of stopgap measures you can put in place, like people who are traveling to a country, they may need to quarantine themselves for 14 days before they can actually go out into the country.
Testing, which we talk about all the time, Wolf, if there was more testing in place, that would also obviate some of these concerns. People could be tested, and have some confidence that at least at the time that they are negative. But, again, because we don't have enough testing, that makes that more difficult to address as well.
BLITZER: It would be, Gloria, a big embarrassment to the president if the Europeans did impose this longer-term travel ban, at a time when he says it's dying out -- his words -- dying out here in the United States.
How will he react, do you think, if they do this?
GLORIA BORGER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, Wolf, I think he will probably be pretty angry about it, because he likes to say that the that the curve is going down, which, of course, it isn't, as we know, in parts of the country.
[18:10:09]
And he likes to say that the United States is having more success with its testing than any other country. It also brings to mind that the president, at the outset of all of this, was very fond of saying that: I acted first. I banned anybody flying in from China.
And now, if the European countries are banning us from flying there, it kind of puts those -- U.S. and China, in a way, on a par that would not make the president happy. The notion of Americans being banned from going to European countries will, I think, make him crazy.
He will be very upset about it, because he wants to portray the success the United States is having, not the failures.
BLITZER: Yes, that's an important point.
David Axelrod, Dr. Fauci and other Coronavirus Task Force members, testifying before Congress today, said, the president never asked them to slow down coronavirus testing. But also today, the president said he wasn't joking when he made that comment Saturday night at that political rally in Tulsa.
So what do you make of this mess on messaging, when more than 120,000, right now, more than 121,000 Americans are dead from this virus?
DAVID AXELROD, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, Wolf, first, let me say, I worked with Dr. Fauci back in 2009 when I worked in the White House on the H1N1 flu pandemic.
And, yes, I saw what I think the country has come to see during this crisis, which is that he is a total straight shooter. I'm sure that if he says that the president never asked him to slow down on testing, then the president never asked him to slow down on testing.
It doesn't mean the president hasn't expressed himself to others around him to slow down testing, including his most immediate aides. He's made his view on this very clear. He views it as inconvenient to know the truth about how pervasive this virus is.
He wants to will it away. He thinks it is politically inconvenient. Look what he's doing today, modeling the wrong behavior. He's the president of the United States, and he is engaged in an activity here that completely contradicts the advice that public health experts are giving.
And he's doing it in a state that is currently hurtling toward a public health disaster because of this pandemic. So, I believe Dr. Fauci, but I also believe the president when he says he doesn't want a lot of testing because he finds it inconvenient to know the numbers, because he has said that before.
This wasn't the first time, Saturday night, that he said it. He's expressed that sentiment before. And it goes right back to the beginning of this pandemic, when he, for six weeks, ignored all the warning signs because he did not want to concede that this was going to be a crisis. BLITZER: At the same time, Gloria, the president seems to be using Dr. Fauci's credibility, his trustworthiness to bolster his own response.
BORGER: Right, because, as David was saying, Fauci said, I haven't been told to do fewer tests, we're going to do more testing, not less. And he said, nobody told him to slow down.
It was interesting to me today that the president in a tweet noted Dr. Fauci's popularity, which is at a stratospheric level of, I believe, 72 percent. And his whole point is, well, if you like him so much, and he says we're OK, why don't you like me? Why don't you believe me that I'm not doing better?
So, also, by the way, anybody having a higher popularity rating than the president is a dangerous place to be for somebody working in the White House. But the president is saying, wait a minute, you trust Fauci, but what about me? He works for me.
BLITZER: Sanjay, let me get your thoughts on what the president's about to do. He is about to speak to these young people who support him.
We're looking at live pictures, a pretty crowded room right there. A lot of young people. You heard Ryan Nobles tell us very few, if any of them are really wearing face masks. They're all jammed in pretty close together right now.
The president is going to walk in there probably in a half-an-hour or an hour or so from now, deliver a speech. This could be awkward and potentially dangerous.
GUPTA: I don't think history will judge us very well for what's happening right now, Wolf.
I mean, you can look at the right side of the screen. Again, we're not even 5 percent of the world's population, 25 percent of the world's cases, 25 percent of the world's deaths. The European Union is considering a travel ban for people coming from the United States.
The numbers are going up in just about all these places where the president has been, Oklahoma, now Arizona. Arizona had an emergency order that went into place because they're concerned about their hospitals becoming potentially overwhelmed with patients.
[18:15:03]
And you see the -- what's happening in this rally, basic public health measures not being followed. It's the worst-case scenario, from the CDC's perspective, indoors, lots of people close together, no physical distancing, not wearing masks, duration.
If you're next to somebody for longer than 15 minutes, that adds another level of risk. People will then go home, potentially spread this virus to their -- to their families, to their communities.
I mean, it defies logic to do this sort of thing, especially given where we are in the country right now.
BLITZER: Yes, it's a serious issue, indeed.
Dr. Sanjay Gupta, Gloria Borger, David Axelrod, guys, thank you very much.
Just ahead, we're going to hear more from Dr. Fauci and other task force members testifying about alarming spikes in new coronavirus cases here in the United States.
And the Texas governor now urging residents to simply stay home after that state was among the earliest to reopen.
[18:20:19]
BLITZER: The coronavirus death toll just rose above 121,000. That's in the past four months. Right now, half of all states are seeing the rate of new cases go up and up.
CNN's Nick Watt is in California with the latest.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
FAUCI: If you look at how we have been hit, we have been hit badly.
NICK WATT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A checkup from Dr. Anthony Fauci, praise for New York, where they are for now controlling COVID- 19.
FAUCI: However, in other areas of the country, we are now seeing a disturbing surge of infections.
WATT: Black Americans are being hit harder. Does institutional racism play a part?
FAUCI: The answer, Congressman, is yes.
WATT: And a vaccine?
FAUCI: I still think there is a reasonably good chance that, by the very beginning of 2021, that, if we're going to have a vaccine, that we will have it by then.
WATT: Meantime, they say, it must be masks, distancing, and handwashing.
FAUCI: The next couple of weeks are going to be critical in our ability to address those surgings that we're seeing.
WATT: Case counts are now rising in half our states.
DR. RICHARD BESSER, FORMER ACTING DIRECTOR, CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION: As we move from total lockdown to a public health model of testing, tracking, isolating, and quarantining, we have yet to see any state make that transition effectively.
WATT: Here's what happened in Texas since reopening began. We knew daily case counts would go up. They have about quadrupled.
GOV. GREG ABBOTT (R-TX): Because the spread is so rampant right now, there is never a reason for you to have to leave your home unless you do need to go out.
WATT: He says even tougher actions might be needed if those numbers keep rising. Here's Florida since reopening began. Average case counts have tripled.
DR. ANDREW PASTEWSKI, JACKSON SOUTH MEDICAL CENTER: A week ago, we had eight patients, none on a ventilator. We are now at over 40-plus patients, four on ventilators. We have had to find a second COVID unit. And they're looking for a third COVID unit right now.
WATT: More than 60 percent of all infections in the U.S. are in those under 50, according to the CDC, increasing fears for schools in the fall and the return to sports.
The world's number tennis player, Novak Djokovic, just tested positive days after hosting an up-close-and-personal tournament, a decision another player called boneheaded.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
WATT: And two new records today in California, Wolf, both of them bad, the most new COVID cases in a day, more than 5,000, the most COVID patients in the hospital, nearly 4,000.
During that testimony on the Hill today, Dr. Redfield from the CDC, he said that this virus has brought the country to its knees. And Dr. Anthony Fauci says that, unless we get ahold of it before the fall, then you're essentially chasing after a forest fire -- Wolf.
BLITZER: Nick Watt reporting for us -- Nick, thank you very much.
Let's bring in Dr. Ashish Jha, the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute.
Dr. Jha, thanks so much for joining us.
So, when the CDC director, Robert Redfield, says the virus has brought this nation to its knees, what do you think lies ahead, as the virus is clearly spreading throughout the country? Let's talk about the next few weeks and months.
DR. ASHISH JHA, DIRECTOR, HARVARD GLOBAL HEALTH INSTITUTE: Yes, Wolf, thanks for having me on.
As I have said before, we are early in this pandemic. We are nowhere near done with this thing. And so, unless we really start acting very differently, and taking this virus much more seriously, we're going to have a lot more cases in the upcoming days and weeks in the states that we're seeing big outbreaks. And in the months ahead, especially as we get into the fall, I'm deeply worried that we're going to see large outbreaks in many parts of the country. I think we can avoid that. But it's going to really require a lot of action, both at the state and federal level.
BLITZER: What kind of action?
JHA: Well, first of all, I know it's -- it feels inconvenient to some number of people, but we have all got to wear masks.
When we're out and about, when we're going to retail stores, when we're going into bars, we got to wear masks. That's going to be one key thing, and I believe we should have a national law or certainly every state should pass a law requiring masks in public places.
Secondly, I think people have to maintain social distancing. And that means getting rid of things like nightclubs. I mean, we just can't afford to have nightclubs and super packed bars right now, in the middle of this pandemic.
And then the third, which we have talked a lot about, which was a focus of the testimony today, is, we have got a really keep pushing on testing and tracing. It's the one tool that we know works to bring the virus levels down.
BLITZER: Yes, that's really, really quickly article.
[18:25:00]
You probably know this. The renowned scientist William Haseltine tells CNN, there's no evidence of what's called herd immunity for coronavirus. Do you agree with this assessment that, much like the common cold, immunity for COVID-19 and anyone who has recovered potentially could be short-lived?
JHA: Right now, Wolf, I just don't know.
We haven't been -- we haven't been dealing with this virus long enough to know how long immunity lasts. It is possible that it could be as little as six or 12 months, which is what we see with the common cold. It could be longer.
But I think counting on herd immunity really requires a strategy where many hundreds of thousands of Americans die, and we may not get herd immunity out of it. I don't think that's a good strategy. This is why we have got to hold out for a vaccine. And we have got to play it smart until then.
BLITZER: Yes, and maybe some treatments that might prevent people getting overly sick or dying. That would be a major breakthrough as well.
Earlier in the day, Dr. Fauci testified before Congress that he still thinks, in his words, there's a reasonably good chance we will have a vaccine by the beginning of next year.
Do you agree?
JHA: I do, Wolf.
I think the science is moving along very nicely. The scientific community has done an extraordinary job. I think, in the fall, we're going to start seeing some large clinical trials. And I'm hoping, by the end of the year or early next year, we will have a vaccine.
But then we have got to make hundreds of millions of doses. We have got to do that in a way that's safe. And then we have got to give it to people. And so I don't really expect, until the end of the first quarter, or maybe more like the second quarter, April, May, June of next year, is when we have enough vaccinations that the virus really starts slowing down and maybe even coming to a halt.
BLITZER: This virus is going to continue for some time.
Dr. Jha, thank you so much for joining us.
JHA: Thanks, Wolf.
BLITZER: Just ahead: As coronavirus cases spike in Texas, first responders are being directly impacted. I will speak with the Houston police chief.
And there's more breaking news we're following on what appeared to be a noose found in the garage of NASCAR's only top black driver -- why the FBI now thinks it was all a misunderstanding.
[18:30:00]
BLITZER: With breaking news tonight, the governor of Texas is now warning all residents that the safest place to be is at home, as the state sees its highest numbers of new infections and hospitalizations nearly two months after reopening.
Let's discuss with the Houston police chief, Art Acevedo. He's also the President of the Major Cities Chiefs Association.
Chief, thank you so much for joining us.
As you know better than anyone, more than a hundred Houston police officers are quarantined right now with coronavirus. How is this spike in cases impacting your work?
CHIEF ART ACEVEDO, HOUSTON POLICE DEPARTMENT: Well we're lucky because we are able to handle it so far. Just think about it, in last three weeks, June 1st, we only had ten officers out with COVID, recovering from COVID, and as of today, we're at 113, and we've only had 165 totals. So that's tells you what a spike we've had in three weeks.
So, so far, it's had a manageable (ph) impact. We have -- we still running on all eight cylinders but its -- you got to worry about it because we've got to keep our workforce safe and we have to keep this community safe, so we're watching it very closely.
BLITZER: Do you know how these officers got the virus?
ACEVEDO: You know, that's a good question, because we had all the protests and we had a lot of close contact, but the state also opened significantly about 25 percent leading up to Memorial Day weekend. Then it went to 50 percent capacity, then at 75 percent.
And so the question is how much of it is from the protests. I think a lot of it is consistent with what we're seeing with the general population, that ever since we opened the state, we're seeing alarming increases across the estate of Texas and Houston is not immune from that.
BLITZER: And you tell me you were worried, you just got another test right? And you just got the results.
ACEVEDO: Yes, thank God, I was very worried about my own results but I just got my second COVID, the one with the -- the one that goes up your nostril and it came back negative. And so I've had two COVID tests are negative, I've had three antibody tests that are negative so I've been fortunate. But my officers are going to double down in terms of our efforts to make sure we stay safe.
BLITZER: Yes, let's hope it stays that way.
Your Governor, Greg Abbott, says the safest place now is to be at home. Do you want to see tougher health restrictions put back in place?
ACEVEDO: You know, Texans are so independent to that it seems like if you tell them they have to do it, some of us would be hardheaded. I just think it's a right thing to do. You know, we should be doing this things and taking this precautions not because we have to, because the government is telling us, but because we're caring Judeo-Christian society and we know that the data shows and the science shows that if we simply take some precautions, wear our masks, it's not for yourself, it's for the people around you. It's the right things to do.
And I know that there some orders are being issued here locally that the businesses have to have -- folks have to have masks on. And we expect our businesses will enforce that to protect their own workforce and the people that are coming in from the community.
So we should start seeing hopefully these measures working in the upcoming days.
BLITZER: Are you increasing your police presence and enforcement in places like bars, other places where crowds may be gathering and folks aren't wearing masks?
ACEVEDO: Yes, you know the ABC, TABC under the direction of the governor, has actually done enforcement throughout the state this last weekend.
[18:35:08] And I'm happy to report that they're doing a good job of keeping our bars and our establishments honest. They have suspended the liquor licenses for 30 days of these bars. And so young people seem to be thinking that they're immune from it and I think that, quite frankly, it's young people going back to bars have been part of the problem.
And so we're starting to see more enforcement from the police department. We're going to continue to focus on violent crime but people need to keep in mind that in the state of Texas the property rights are taken very seriously.
And if a business tells you can't come in, forget whether or not the government is telling you. That business entity has every right to keep you from coming in. You'll probably end up getting criminal trespass violation if you do not abide by the orders and the direction of the private entities telling you what to do.
BLITZER: And those young people have to know that even if they get it and have a very mild case or totally asymptomatic, they can pass it on to their mothers and fathers and grandparents and friends. That is extremely dangerous. Chief Acevedo, thank you so much for joining us.
ACEVEDO: Thank you, have a great day.
BLITZER: You too.
Just ahead, the FBI reveals what it just found out about the noose found in the garage of NASCAR driver, Bubba Wallace. We'll get the latest.
And this, are positive coronavirus cases right now among student athletes putting college sports in real jeopardy? I'll ask the commissioner of the Southeastern Conference, all that coming up next.
[18:40:00]
BLITZER: We're back with breaking news on an incident that appeared to be a new flash point in the fight against racism. The FBI just revealed its findings on that noose-like rope found in the garage of the NASCAR star Bubba Williams. CNN's Alexandra Field has details for us.
Alexandra, the FBI says this was not, I repeat, not a hate crime.
ALEXANDRA FIELD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Not a hate crime. So there will be no federal charges, no evidence of a federal crime, no evidence of a crime against the driver, Bubba Wallace. They assigned 15 FBI agents. It now seems that the noose found in his garage was part of a garage door rope pull.
NASCAR has just put out this statement explaining the FBI report concludes and photographic evidence confirms that the garage door pull rope fashioned like a noose had been positioned there since as early as last fall. This was obviously well before the 43 team's arrival and garage assignment. We appreciate the FBI's quick and thorough investigation and are thankful to learn that this was not an intentional, racist act against Bubba. We remain steadfast in our commitment to providing a welcoming an inclusive environment for all who love racing.
Certainly there's been a lot of support for Bubba Wallace in the last few days, and also in the last week or so since he called for NASCAR to ban the confederate flag at all of its events, a move that NASCAR decided to take on and quickly implement it. Wolf?
BLITZER: Yes, Bubba Wallace. I misspoke earlier. He's truly, truly a great American. We'll watch the story unfold. Thanks very much, Alexandra, for that update.
Meanwhile, the Southeastern Conference is warning the State of Mississippi that it won't host championships events, unless a confederate symbol is removed from the state's flag. For more on this, we're joined by the Southeastern Conference Commissioner, Greg Sankey. Greg, thank you so much for joining us.
Tell us why you decided to issue this ultimatum to the State of Mississippi?
GREG SANKEY, COMMISSIONER, SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE: It really goes back just over five years now when the tragedy in Charleston resulted in nine deaths in a church shooting, I was asked in my first year as Commissioner of the SEC, what's your position on these state displays of the confederate battle flag and that time, I called for change.
And in my statement last week identified really an encouraging tone that we're past the time for change. And I truly believe that I needed to be said in a clear statement.
And we're going into a cycle where we looking at some future championship sites. We rotate certain championships between our campuses, which are welcoming places and have identified that that's, if you will, a lever that we could use to encourage change because we want our campuses, we want our states which are field with great people to be the kind of welcoming environment for our student athletes that we would expect.
BLITZER: We've seen other sports leagues that confront racial injustice as well. Do you think we're entering potentially a new era of athletes and sports leagues, using their influence to fight for social change?
SANKEY: You know, I was on a call of our head football coaches almost two weeks ago. And one of our coaches observed that our student athletes, our young people are asking us for support rather than permission. And perhaps years ago, it was permission. But they're looking for support.
And we provide guidance, and education along the sort of conversations and governance and politics and leadership. And I think these types of statements are a reflection of that support expectation and the outcome of growing leaders which is basically what we do every day on our campuses.
BLITZER: Let me get your thoughts on the potential return of college sports during this coronavirus pandemic. A lot of experts believe the virus will still be a big threat when students return to campus in the fall. Several schools have already reported athletes testing positive for the virus during their summer workouts. If the current situation holds, would it be safe to play college sports in the fall?
[18:45:01]
SANKEY: Well, I think the reality is, nothing related to our current circumstance over the last three months has helped. We do have the virus. We had the virus back in March and we cancelled our basketball tournaments. You have -- we learn every day. We engage medical experts in helping us understand how to best to oversee, how best to monitor and how best to sanitize and treat our young people.
And there's a difference between some of the reports about numbers on isolation or quarantining, because we're in this tracing program, and we have had positive tests. I think in any endeavor right now, you're going to have those positive tests but we want to be aggressive to stop the spread. And we're on a journey and my focus is preparing the play season as scheduled.
But the reality is the circumstances around the virus will guide us in that decision making. But I think right now, we're at an appropriate point in our preparation and both our learning, but most importantly in our care for our young people.
BLITZER: That's the most important thing. You're absolutely right.
So, do you think we'll see college football, for example, in the fall and if we do, will there be fans in those big stadiums?
SANKEY: Yes, the beauty is I don't have to answer every one of those questions in final right now. We're seeing opportunities for fans to be at events. We were talking about Talladega. A very small number.
I don't -- I don't expect that the numbers would remain necessarily that small but we're going to -- we're going to pay attention to our state and local and campus public health officials in guiding us to make the determination about fans. I would think the game itself would look much like we're accustomed to, but there are fewer people around the sidelines. You know, the presence of masks I expect to be some place around our competitions.
That doesn't mean in, but if we've got people measuring first downs, you're going to see that type of reality we're seeing in our lives every day. But the message is we want to engage in those public health exercises now, wear a mask, engage in social distancing, engage in hygiene so that we can have these opportunities come forward.
BLITZER: Yes, it's a whole new world for all of us. Commissioner, thank you so much for joining us. Good luck.
SANKEY: Thank you, Wolf. BLITZER: All right. Just ahead, President Trump repeats he now debunked attacks against mail-in voting. We're going to bring you the facts on mail-in voting when we come back.
[18:52:07]
BLITZER: President Trump is once again now attacking mail-in voting here in the United States with some new baseless and false claims.
CNN's Brian Todd is gathering the facts.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It seems to be President Trump's conspiracy du jour, his recurring claims about voter fraud in this year's election, specifically fraud with ballots that are mailed in.
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: When you do all mail-in voting ballots, you're asking for fraud. People steal them out of mailboxes. People print them and then they sign them and they give them in and people don't even know when they're double counted.
TODD: In one barrage of tweets this week, Trump pounded on the idea. Mail-in ballots will lead to rigged election. Millions of mail-in ballots will be printed by foreign countries and others. It will be the scandal of our times.
Trump's attorney general had the same talking points on FOX Business.
WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Right now, a foreign country could print up tens of thousands of counterfeit ballots and it would be very hard for us to detect.
TODD: But William Barr himself said he hasn't looked into it and he's offered no evidence to back up the claim.
CNN has done multiple fact checks on the theories of widespread mail voter fraud and we found no evidence that any of it is true.
The Federal Election Commission and independent experts back us up.
MICHAEL MCDONALD, UNITED STATES ELECTION PROJECT: It's miniscule versus the number of ballots that have been cast.
TODD: Experts tell us committing mail voter fraud on mass scale in the U.S. is exceedingly difficult. Each county in America, almost every precinct, has different styles of ballots, they say. So fraudsters would have to duplicate them perfectly. And if a foreign country tried to inject counterfeit mail-in ballots, safeguards in place would nail them.
MCDONALD: The election officials themselves are printing bar codes on the ballots and the envelopes and to making sure that the ballots are going out to the proper voters, voters are signing those return envelopes, so there's signature verification that's going on on the election official's end.
TODD: About a quarter of American voters cast ballots by absentee in mail in 2016. President Trump has voted by mail as has Vice President Pence, Attorney General Barr, Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, and White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany. With coronavirus still a major health threat, experts say the percentage of those mailing in votes could go way up this year and should to be safer.
So, why does the president keep harping on the conspiracy?
LAURA COATES, FORMER JUSTICE DEPARTMENT VOTING RIGHTS ATTORNEY: I think that President Trump and A.G. Barr are fixated on voter fraud as a distraction. In the past, we've heard the president make comments that if you expand the franchise and have more people voting, that he believes it will minimize the chances of a Republican being elected.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
TODD: But the president does not seem to have the backing of some top members of his own party for his conspiracy theory. CNN spoke with several Republican senators including those in top leadership positions.
[18:55:00]
None of them agreed with the president's comments about mail-in voting -- Wolf.
BLITZER: Brian Todd, reporting for us, thank you.
More news just ahead.
BLITZER: Finally, we pay tribute to more of the people the U.S. has lost to the coronavirus.
Sandra Krakow of Massachusetts was 69 years old, a nurse for three decades. She was known for sacrificing her own comfort to help others. Her husband says she never acknowledged the pain she was in until her dying moments when she asked ""why me?""
Mike Lepine of New York was 81. He worked at his family owned butcher shop for half a century. His grandson worked their as well. He says his pops was the sweetest, coolest guy you ever met, and he says if you knew him, you were blessed.
May they rest in peace, and may their memories be a blessing.

35,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_751/Files (250).DOCX","CNN.com",2020-06-15,"1184 words","OPINIONS","Opinion by Ed Morales",NA,"America has to reckon with its original sins",FALSE,"During one of the most tumultuous weeks in recent American history, massive demonstrations against the brutal actions of Minneapolis police in the death of George Floyd spread across the country in over 700 cities and towns.
In response, President Donald Trump called for more police violence against protesters, before brandishing a Bible in front of the St. John's Church near to the White House.
Trump talked of ""law and order,"" a phrase designed to attract a political base that might feel threatened by the valid grievances of a multicultural coalition of marchers for whom taking to the streets has become their only recourse. Their actions, designed to provoke meaningful change, harken back to the words of James Baldwin, writing about 1966 riots in Harlem: ""The law is meant to be my servant and not my master, still less my torturer and my murderer."" Baldwin continued, ""To respect the law, in the context in which the American Negro finds himself, is simply to surrender his self-respect.""
The effectiveness of this unprecedented level of street activism -- with echoes of the 1968 civil rights and anti-Vietnam War protests, as well as the L.A. Rodney King riots in 1992, Occupy Wall Street, and the Ferguson uprisings of 2014 -- in bringing about anti-racist policy change is already being debated.
In his town hall speech earlier this month, former President Barack Obama highlighted that street protest and conventional politics as not mutually exclusive, but together are key elements in a ""Change in mindset that is taking place ... a greater recognition that we can do better.""
Yet even Obama's 2015 Task Force on 21st Century Policing has not seemed to create the necessary change he had hoped for.
As a journalist who covered police brutality in New York City in the 1990s, I have often seen the obstructions that police reform has encountered: The ineffectiveness of internal police investigations, an often inconsequential civilian complaint review board and an increasing reliance on police for controlling crime, drug dependence and mental illness problems ratcheted up by the administration of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani that were exacerbated by an economy that relegated people of color to the bottom tier of our country's workforce.
The systemic racism that underlies ""broken windows"" policing theory was made clear by the coronavirus pandemic, fueling the passion of demonstrators.
While calls are growing to ""defund"" or ""dismantle"" police by significantly shifting government funding away from police departments and toward education, affordable housing and drug abuse treatment and rehabilitation, this moment is a chance for America to go even further than policy reform.
There are even serious calls to abolish policing as we know it from organizers and academics wary as a result of reforms that have failed historically.
While the role of police in our society is central to the current wave of protests, there are so many conversations happening about systemic racism that indicate a need to get to the root of the problem. This is a chance for this country to look into the mirror and acknowledge the grave injustices that accompanied its founding -- injustices that have continued unabated and in different, at times hidden, forms -- and own up to them, once and for all.
As Michelle Alexander wrote in The New York Times last week, ""Donald Trump would not be the president and George Floyd would not be dead if, after the Civil War, our nation had committed itself to reparations, reconciliation, and atonement for the land and people that colonizers stole, sold, and plundered.""
During the Democratic primary debates, candidates Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker supported the idea of reparations, but the theoretical groundwork for such claims begins with apology and atonement.
Such a gesture would be a necessary correction to the prevailing discourse of American exceptionalism -- painting it as the world's leading democracy -- as a first step to dismantle the hidden legacy of white supremacy from the top.
Such an apology should spring from a series of public conversations, considerably more elaborate and ambitious than Obama's unmemorable ""beer summit"" between Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates and the officer who arrested him in front of his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 2009.
It should be remembered that formal governmental apologies, such as the one Australia offered in 2008 and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission held by South Africa, have not been panaceas, and those countries are still plagued by racism and racial division. These conversations could be somehow formally codified in public documents that could serve as the basis for widespread change in public policy.
By frankly reassessing America's origin story, as well as its first 150 years, a more comprehensive picture of how injustices have been meted out to its several marginalized groups comes into picture. After all, protests around the country are multiracial in composition, with varied communities of color participating.
While centering the injustice of slavery, Jim Crow and mass incarceration is essential, a national conversation must include a reckoning with the displacement of Native Americans from their lands and subsequent banishment to reservations.
This conversation must also examine the legacy of the treatment and lynchings of Mexicans absorbed by the US in the 1847 war, the racist Insular Cases that hold Puerto Rico as a colonial territory and the 61-year legacy of the Chinese Exclusion Act, which prevented Chinese immigrants from becoming citizens, as well as Cold War ""yellow peril"" narratives are reflected in current day hate crimes blaming Chinese citizens for the coronavirus.
Beyond questions of race, areas of discrimination and also institutional bias against women and LGBTQ communities -- this weekend one of New York's largest protests was organized around the message ""Black Trans Lives Matter.""
Yet I can't help but wonder if America had such a clearing of the air about race, it might have been different earlier this month, when a column of police officers with batons, enforcing the city's then-8 p.m. curfew, raced after and surrounded a group of protesters just a few blocks away from my home in the Bronx, arresting some and reportedly pummeling others, including press and official observers.
Were these not police who, by virtue of the leadership of the chief executive, and the official narrative of America, acted with violence because there was nothing to apologize for? Were they not ""caught,"" as Baldwin wrote in his book of essays ""No Name in the Street:, ""in the lie of their pretended humanism""?
This is not the time to settle for Democratic congressional members ""taking a knee,"" an action emblematic of token reforms that will not go to the root of the problem. With George Floyd protests spreading across the globe, the world is waiting for America to finally come clean and recognize its original sins.
It must say loudly and clearly, we are not what we said we were, and we can't move forward until we acknowledge the damage we have done."
36,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_751/Files (250).DOCX","Newstex Blogs",2020-08-24,"2312 words",NA,"James Ramsay",NA,"Chinatown Luminaries On The Future Of The Neighborhood",FALSE,"Aug 24, 2020( Gothamist: http://www.gothamist.com/ Delivered by Newstex) Going back to January of this year, well before New York City as a whole began to see the coronavirus as a serious threat, Manhattan's Chinatown was already suffering. Racist fears about the spread of the virus correlated not only with a spike in hate crimes against Asian New Yorkers, but in a general avoidance of Chinatown that decimated the local restaurant industry.And yet, Chinatown remains very much a vibrant Chinatown. While many historic districts around the city have turned into condo-lined neighborhoods with a whiff of nostalgia —the median home sale in Little Italy last year jumped to $2.6 million[1] — Chinatown has avoided both disappearing, and becoming a museum of itself. 
https://gothamist.com/tags/new-york-city-tomorrow For our New York City Tomorrow series[2], where we're asking New Yorkers for their utopian (but often realistic!) ideas of how the city could look, we spoke with three Chinatown luminaries —Assemblymember Yuh-Line Niou, Winnie's Bar manager Teddy Mui, and 46 Mott Bakery manager Patrick Mock —about their ideas for the future of the neighborhood.Their interviews have been edited and condensed. You-Line Niou, AssemblymemberRepresenting New York's 65th District, which covers much of Lower Manhattan Assemblymember Niou: In every single tourist brochure in New York City — and in our mind's eye when we think of New York City — there's not a single person who doesn't think about Little Italy, Chinatown, and the Statue of Liberty. When people think of New York, it starts here in Lower Manhattan.So one thing is, we should get a particular percentage of the tourism budget. That should be something given to Chinatown for bringing people into the city, because nobody thinks of New York without thinking of Chinatown. We're on every brochure! You always see a line dancer or a dragon or something going on in Chinatown.But does the city consider us as the priority? No. We get so little of the city's budget, and we get so little of the state's budget. We get so little consideration when it comes to resources.What would you do with those resources — if the state said tomorrow, 'You-Line, we're doubling your budget,' what would you do? Folks don't realize, we have so many different languages being spoken in Chinatown, and it's important that we provide services that are accessible by everyone. People don't really know how to get permits and access to things they need to know, and then they're dinged for it before they knew they even had to go through a process.Some people are not even able to express if they're wrongly targeted — a ticket will be written for them, and they can't say, 'this is not the right address.' It's a small thing, but it'd be great if they didn't scare our merchants to death. I think those things would be helped if there was true language access.Also, it would be really amazing to see a robust night vision of Chinatown. We don't have that because there's just not the foot traffic or the same kind of incentive for some of the cool stuff going on elsewhere. It has to do with some permitting, etcetera. But it would be cool to have a kind of night market with fried chicken in a bag, tofu on a stick, curry fish balls — the food would be great and fibrant, it'd be so fun!Regarding restaurants, I want them to be able to charge what they're worth. I think there's a lot of racism there, when it comes to the conceptualization of this cheap Chinese food, and being able to get things for a lot cheaper in Chinatown. But the rents are not different, and the food and quality are immense.And by the way — there's a love and a sadness to it. I survived in Chinatown during grad school — you can get a plate of 15 dumplings for less $4! It's insane! You shouldn't be able to get that quality and that much food for that little. That's just barely scraping by. But that's the expectation when people come to Chinatown, there's just a weird stereotype that Chinese food is cheap food.How do you think the neighborhood has managed to stay so active as a Chinatown, rather than turning into a neighborhood of Chase banks and high rises? I think it manages to stay that way because a lot of these buildings and properties were bought right after the Chinese Exclusion Act was lifted, and a lot of these were bought by families together. So it's not so easy to sell a property there.Also, when you're first an immigrant and come to New York — even me, I gravitated towards Chinatown, because that's where I would find family and friends, and a place to go. And that's still the case for Asian immigrants, it's still the place to find resources and a friend that will speak your language. arrow Mott Street outdoor dining in August 2020 Scott Lynch / Gothamist [3] Teddy Mui, manager of Winnie's BarAnd son of founder Winnie Mui Teddy Mui: If we had our way, we'd be able to renovate our buildings — most of Chinatown is still in tenement buildings. Most of our restaurants and bars are in tenement buildings, where it's tight. It's hard to work out of.Why can't you renovate? Well, I have a cousin who just recently renovated her apartment. She's a little bit older than me — I'm 41. She's lived there her whole life, and until recently, her bathtub was still in her kitchen.What we're living in are true tenement conditions, still. It's the 21st century, but no one notices because we're not known for speaking up, or we're under rent control, so the landlords don't need to renovate our buildings and they don't need to worry about how much the buildings are failing. Most of these buildings, the wiring is horrible — if they could get fixed, that would be the first step to a more perfect Chinatown. But it's hard on the landlords too, they're rent controlled buildings.But as soon as an apartment with rent control - the bad way to say it is, 'dies out,' where the tenant passes with no one to hand it down to — the landlords renovate these apartments and then they go back to way over market price. You're looking at one-bedrooms in Chinatown for $2,000. And your neighbor is paying $300. But her bathtub doesn't work.When you look down the road 20 years, what kinds of big changes do you want to see? I would love to see a commingling of Chinatown and the Lower East Side, because it brings that much more community into our neighborhood. I grew up in Chinatown, but it's not like I didn't hang out at the Vladeck and Smith projects, because that's where my friends were.And there's a huge Chinese community within a lot of Latino countries — if you ask a true Cuban what is the best Cuban food, they'll tell you Chino-Cubano is the best Cuban food. Cuban food cooked by Chinese people! It's this commingling — Chinatown is great, but we realize Chinatown is not going to last the way it is. These little ethnic enclaves around the city, they're going to slowly get gentrified. And that's fine with us, as long as we're able to keep our culture there, to show where these neighborhoods really came from.Landmarking some of the Chinese landmarks around Chinatown would be great, too — if you walk around Chinatown right now, there's landmarked buildings for Italian-Americans, there's landmarked areas from when the Irish were there, and where Jewish people were there. But there's no landmarks for the Chinese, and we're the last ones here, we're the ones keeping the condos from rising up into the sky.To the extent that the culture of the neighborhood has remained intact, why do you think that is? What's kept Chinatown Chinatown — there was a fear of going into Chinatown. 'It's that neighborhood where they don't all speak our language.' I had friends growing up who wouldn't come to Chinatown back then, because they wouldn't know what we were saying, if we were planning to kill them behind their backs, when literally we were just asking each other what we were gonna have for dinner.It's that xenophobia that kind of kept Chinatown Chinatown, but that has been changing. When you can offer a one-bedroom for $1,500 when across the street in Little Italy, it's $2,500, people will start not caring about it being Chinatown.If you go all the way back to the beginnings of Winnie's Bar, and talk to native Chinatown sons and daughters, you will hear that back in the day, Winnie's Bar was a Chinese gangster bar. And it was! A lot of Chinese gangsters hung out during those days at the bar, but they were the only ones there, because everyone was afraid of them. But in the 90s after they took down John Gotti, they went after the Chinese gangs, too. So for a period of 3 years or so, we were very close to closing.And then we noticed young professionals from the Financial District coming down and singing karaoke, it was starting to hit Western culture. And our crowd grew from there. College students. The bridge-and-tunnel crowd. And now we have — I don't like labeling them hipsters, but we have the hipsters. But we have a beautiful mix! It's some tourists, some young professionals, but we also have our Chinese regulars sitting there playing dice games while you're singing your Shania Twain song. Every weekend, I see the perfect mix of what my customers should be.What makes you feel optimistic about the future of the neighborhood? What's making me feel optimistic about the future is the younger generation that's starting to step up and voice their concerns and opinions on how things should be done.Chinatown is very traditional, almost to a fault, where we've let our elders take over. And we need to learn from our elders, but young people need to be making decisions now, and move Chinatown further. And seeing people like Patrick Mock start standing up and speaking out on the injustices we've suffered, it gives us a hope for the future. arrow Patrick Mock outside of his bakery in August 2020 Scott Lynch / Gothamist [4] Patrick Mock, manager of 46 Mott BakeryAnd a local advocate[5] who's been providing free meals during the pandemic What do you want to see change, coming out of the pandemic? I want Chinatown to be as vibrant as it ever was, but I want it to be more accepting of the younger generation, too.In Chinese culture, we're always taught to respect our elders. And I always have —I always listen to them. But in times like Covid, even their experiences aren't enough to make them deal with what's going on. Our younger generation adapts faster, changes faster — but explaining it to our elders, they don't understand. Or they feel like we're trying to take power away from them.What's an example where that conflict comes up? Well one of my ideas that I've been trying to talk about is to just close the streets for the weekend. Or just Friday night and Saturday night, no vehicles, from Bayard Street down. Just to set up outdoor dining, lights, entertainment. Any way we can attract people coming down to Chinatown on a weekend night, to bring foot traffic and revenue back into the neighborhood.But some of my elders have voices concern about Access-a-Ride, not being able to find parking. And then they bring up, 'Oh, you guys are gonna make it a rowdy nightmare like the East Village.' But on Mott Street, there's only one place with a full liquor license, out of the whole street.Me trying to explain it to them, and they're coming up with one reason after another. I respect all my elders, but right now, we need more business down here and more foot traffic. I understand they're not comfortable with it, but doing nothing doesn't help at all. Just finding ways of explaining, talking, and having my elders think the way I'm thinking. Because I understand where they're coming from, but they don't understand where I'm coming from.I know you've expressed ambivalence about how Chinatown relies on tourism... Yeah, I really hate that We rely on it so much,and look where it's taken us. With tourism done, we don't know what to do. I want Chinatown to be more local, more friendly, more of a city destination for New Yorkers, where you want to take your kids during the weekend, or you want to take your family out for some type of special occasion.Our neighborhood is very rich in culture, it's very rich in history, and at the same time, we have so much youth —the best thing I see about Covid is that it shows the younger generation has interest in Chinatown. We can use that to our advantage. Just because some of us are not working doesn't mean we don't have the creative talent to get things done. We can see it in new nonprofits started up by people my age. There's so much that our younger generation could help with. But we need elders to be more accepting of our help, instead of fearing that we're going to take power.What's a big idea you have for something new coming out of this? You know how we lost Lunar New Years? That's our biggest festive holiday. There's another one coming up October 1st, the Moon Festival, the Autumn Festival. That's another big festival for being Chinese, because it represents family and unity. I want to promote that as the second big holiday for the neighborhood. [Because large events were canceled through September 30th[6], the hope is to have a street festival when October arrives.]And I want it to be something elders can be proud of, where they can be proud of the younger generation for giving it our all. Young people have to be respectful, but it doesn't hurt to speak your mind and ask questions. Everything is not okay.

Rather than straightforwardly telling readers that Trump was lying about the state of the nation, AP marveled at the ""dizzyingly different versions of reality,"" and claimed that the candidates' ""all the conflicting messages carry at least a sliver of truth, some much more than others.""
Joni Ernst: Trumpism Before Trump
In a declaration of divorce from the Republican Party, Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin (9/3/20) wrote:
Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) used to be considered a middle-of-the-road Republican-before she exonerated Trump for plainly impeachable conduct. Now, she sounds just like him.
The truth is that corporate media worked hard to conceal how far-right Ernst was when she first debuted in national politics (FAIR.org, 1/20/15).
For instance, in a report called ""Meet Joni Ernst,"" ABC News (1/20/15) described her as ""the first woman to ever represent the state in Congress,"" who ""catapulted to political stardom with an ad about castrating hogs,"" and who ""touted herself as a Harley-riding Sunday school teacher.""
It didn't mention that she called President Barack Obama a ""dictator"" (Yahoo! News, 7/8/14), supported legislation that would allow ""local law enforcement to arrest federal officials attempting to implement"" Obamacare (Talking Points Memo, 10/3/14), promoted a conspiracy theory that the UN was ""planning on moving people off of their agricultural land ...and then telling them that you don't have property rights anymore"" (Mother Jones, 9/25/14), or that she carried a gun to ""defend myself ...from the government, should they decide that my rights are no longer important"" (Think Progress, 10/23/14). In short, Ernst sounded a lot like Trump before most people had heard what Trump really sounded like.
'An Abdication of Their Core Responsibility'
Noting that ""mainstream news outlets still aren't integrating basic climate science facts in their stories about record-breaking extreme weather,"" climate writer Emily Atkin (Heated, 9/8/20) noted that ""most of the major newspaper stories"" about wildfires devastating the Western US over Labor Day weekend ""don't contain any climate-related information."" For example, the New York Times' ""Extreme Heat Turns State Into a Furnace"" (9/7/20) had 1,700 words about how heat, fire and smoke were devastating Californians-but none of those words were ""climate change.""AP's ""Scorched Earth: Record 2
Million Acres Burned in California"" (9/7/20) noted numerous ways the fires were breaking records-but failed to explain why those records were being broken. News outlets leaving out how humans are disrupting the climate from extreme weather stories, Atkin writes, ""is an abdication of their core responsibility: to give citizens the information they need to make informed decisions about how to solve society's biggest problems.""
No, Urbanites Are Not Fleeing to the Suburbs
""Urban Exiles Are Fuelling a Suburban Housing Boom Across the US ""reported the Financial Review (8/26/20). ""Pandemic Leads to Urban Exodus,"" said Forbes (6/10/20). ""The Flight to the Suburbs Is Real and Growing,"" declared CNBC (6/18/20). Only it isn't, according to the website Curbed (8/31/20), reporting on a comprehensive study comparing real estate statistics from urban and suburban markets: Suburban homes are not selling more quickly, rising more in value or being searched for online more than those in the city. But the tenacious myth, Curbed's Jeff Andrews pointed out, does prop up the narrative that ""cities-all cities, but especially the diverse, Democratic-led ones-are headed for inevitable collapse.""
Opposing Fascism Doesn't Meet NYT's 'Acceptability Standards'
When Cornell philosophy professor Nicholas Sturgeon died, his obituary called on friends to honor his memory by ""soundly defeating the incumbent of the White House and rescuing our democracy from fascism."" But when the notice appeared in the New York Times (9/6/20), the part about ""from fascism"" was cut, with a Times representative explaining that it ""doesn't meet our acceptability standards.""
Krugman Recalls 9/11's Silver Linings
""Overall, Americans took 9/11 pretty calmly,"" New York Times columnist Paul Krugman tweeted on the 19th anniversary of September 11 attacks. ""Notably, there wasn't a mass outbreak of anti-Muslim sentiment and violence, which could all too easily have happened."" Anti-Muslim hate crimes increased 17-fold after 9/11, the FBI reported (Human Rights Watch, 11/02)-but apparently that doesn't qualify as ""mass.""
Krugman, after praising George W. Bush as someone who ""tried to calm prejudice, not feed it,"" did acknowledge that he used 9/11 to ""take us into an unrelated and disastrous war""-the almost 19-year-long occupation of Afghanistan, apparently, not qualifying as a disaster. Before alluding to Iraq, Krugman mentioned that in the wake of the attacks, ""my wife and I took a lovely trip to the US Virgin Islands...because air fares and hotel rooms were so cheap.""

Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.
Big tech takes the stand against China's crackdown on Hong Kong's freedom. Google, Facebook and Twitter all saying that they will not release user data to Hong Kong law enforcement.
Tiktok planning pulling its app from the city as well. This as the U.S. looks to ban Tiktok and other China-based social media apps.
Coronavirus cases are still rising at alarming rate meanwhile. Dr. Anthony Fauci is warning we are still knee-deep in the first wave. Cities like New York reopening while other areas including Los Angeles and Miami have reversed course.
Markets are pulling back this morning after a big rally yesterday. Take a look. We've got a triple digits decline with the Dow futures down 205 points. Nasdaq down 31. And the S&P futures right now down 20 points an hour and a half away from the opening bell.
This after a strong rally kicked off the week yesterday pushing the Nasdaq to yet another recorded high. The Nasdaq in unchartered territory at 10433 with a gain yesterday of 226 points.
Who dipped into the Paycheck Protection Program? Companies include law offices, big Girl Scouts, PF Chang, even Kanye West's clothing company and restaurants backed by Robert de Niro. The list causing controversy this morning.
Meanwhile crime is rising in major U.S. cities. Georgia's governor has declared a state of emergency in Georgia deploying the National Guard following a weekend of violence in Atlanta.
Plus Parler gaining momentum as an alternative to Twitter. Its CEO John Matze will join me in about half an hour. Don't miss that, coming up.
MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.
Global markets this morning are under some selling pressure. Take a look at European indices right across the board with the FT 100 right now down 87 points. The CAC 40 down 46. And the Dax index down 150 points.
The Eurozone is heading toward a deeper recession than earlier predicted. The European Union's commission forecasting a record contraction of 8.7 percent in 2020. Next year, they're expecting a rise of just over 6 percent. So they are looking at growth in 2021.
In Asia overnight, markets are mostly lower except for China where stocks rose again following Monday's big rally, after a state-run media reported that China needs a healthy bull market and is ready to add support to attract investors. The Shanghai composite up another third of a percent overnight. The Hang Seng Hong Kong index down one and a third percent.
Joining the conversation this morning: Dagen McDowell, Jon Hilsenrath and Michael Kantrowitz. Great show so far, guys. Thanks so much for being here.

JON HILSENRATH, SENIOR WRITER, ""THE WALL STREET JOURNAL"": Great to be here.
MICHAEL KANTROWITZ, CORNERSTONE MACRO: Thank you.
BARTIROMO: Some of the top stories that we are watching this morning now.
Leaders in major U.S. cities are vowing to get crime under control after a violent weekend.
Georgia Governor Brian Kemp says that he will deploy 1,000 National Guard troops after at least 30 people were shot in Atlanta over the weekend, five people were killed including an eight-year-old girl.
In New York, more violence leading to outrage after a video is reported to show a man holding his daughter's hand as he is gunned down. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio says the situation is unacceptable and is blaming an uptick in violence on the coronavirus.
Meanwhile we know that shootings are up 205 percent in New York after the making the decision to disband the plainclothes anticrime unit in New York. Shootings up better than 200 percent.
Meanwhile the White House says it is ready to play a larger role in the debate over how to address the violence adding that the country needs to focus on securing its streets.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo meanwhile says that the Trump administration may soon ban Chinese social media apps including Tiktok. Pompeo weighed in on Fox News last night.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We are taking this very seriously. We're certainly looking at it. We've worked on this very issue for a long time.
LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Would you recommend that people download that app on their phones tonight, tomorrow, any time currently?
POMPEO: Only if you want your private information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BARTIROMO: Tiktok says it is leaving the Hong Kong market after China imposed a controversial national security law there. The Beijing based app has been trying to make moves to distance itself from China. But how can you when you're a Chinese company. That includes naming an American and former Disney executive Kevin Mayer as CEO. Kevin Mayer is the current CEO of Tiktok.
Facebook and Twitter suspending requests for data from Hong Kong's government after China recently approved a controversial national security law. The two companies say that they are reviewing the implications of the new law which gives China sweeping powers to crack down on dissent in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong police made its first arrest under the new law last week. Ten people were detained.
Meanwhile in Seattle, the city council has approved a payroll tax on big businesses that pay the highest salaries. The new tax targets companies with annual payrolls of at least $7 million dollars and salaries of more than $150,000.
Lawmakers estimated that the plan called Jumpstart Seattle will raise $214 million dollars a year. The money would be used for COVID-19 relief and to build more affordable housing.
Taking on Chinese technology. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last night the U.S. is considering banning Tiktok and other Chinese social media apps. This comes less than a week after the FCC designated Huawei and ZTE as national security threats.
Dagen McDowell, your reaction to this. I want to get your take on what is going on in terms of these security threats in China -- coming from China. But also get your take on what is going on in these cities across the country.
I tweeted over weekend that we saw this coming in New York. You and I were railing on the new bail reform law for two years now when we saw the security. Now look at 64 people shot in New York City during the violent Fourth of July weekend according to police, Dagen.
MCDOWELL: Well, you mentioned this in the news, Maria, that Mayor Bill de Blasio is blaming recent events with the coronavirus shutdowns in New York City. No. This is the policy that has been put in place by liberal leaders here in New York City and in other places across the country.
""The Wall Street Journal"" editorial that I know that you tweeted out over the weekend called ""New York's cop-out"" goes through what has gone on since Mayor Bill de Blasio took over the nation's safest big city.
Now it is a dangerous hellhole because of him and because of other leaders particularly Governor Cuomo.
I'll just go through a couple of things. So the city council eased law -- laws about quality of life offenses say public urination. The Manhattan D.A. Cy Vance no longer prosecuting those offense. Governor Andrew Cuomo's bail reform which basically turned there's no bail for arson, for hate crimes, for manslaughter, for the assault of a child under 11 years of age. No bail.
And individuals are being picked up and released over and over and over again. These are criminals. They won't call them that. And then in recent weeks --
BARTIROMO: Yes.
MCDOWELL: -- you have had the police department dismantling its plainclothes anticrime unit. These rich liberals have security protection. And rich folks can get guns. They can get a carry permit. They have security details traveling with them.
Meanwhile, people who have no way of protecting themselves are being the victims of crimes all across this city and all across other cities. It is disgraceful what these politicians have done to the American people.
BARTIROMO: It's true. You are right. And the gun violence is continuing to kill. Can you believe Mayor de Blasio is blaming COVID-19? 160 people dead. Gun violence in the holiday weekend. 64 people shot just during the violent Fourth of July weekend. He is blaming COVID-19, Dagen.
MCDOWELL: A man shot holding the hand of a child in the middle of the street, in broad daylight. And by the way, in New York City, you cannot carry a gun if you are you a private citizen. The Second Amendment does not apply to you here.
You can barely keep a gun in home. The only reason that the state changed - - the city changed the law and the state changed the law is to avoid the Supreme Court hearing that case. It did hear it and it didn't make a decision on it because the law was changed.
But you, it is basically, unless you are a rich celebrity, you cannot get a carry permit here in New York. I can protect myself from the coronavirus. I can wear a mask. I can keep my distance from other people. But in terms of the crime that is happening in this city, you are at the mercy of criminals who have been coddled by Cuomo and de Blasio and their ilk.
BARTIROMO: I mean New York feels like a different city to me. Jon Hilsenrath when you look at the violence across these cities, whether it's New York, Chicago, Atlanta don't you think that that is going to elongate what has been a very tough economic story for these cities due to this recession and the shutdown?
I mean, it is going to make it that much more difficult to actually get growth. Real estate prices are plummeting. People are fleeing New York right now.
HILSENRATH: Well, there is no question that safety is a fundamental factor that led to the renaissance of American cities over the last 20 or 30 years because crime rates fell dramatically across the country including New York.
And it's certainly worrying. You know, one of the things that I find that is interesting right now is that this crime that we're seeing is violent. So if you look at murder rates, it's up in New York, it's up in Atlanta, it's up in Chicago, it's up in Baltimore.
If you look at robberies, they are actually down. And I don't quite understand that. I don't understand what is behind it. But if cities in America don't get -- keep violence under control, then, you know, they are going to risk losing a lot of the gains that they had.
I am not convinced yet that this is the kind of pandemic we had in 1980s, 1990s but Maria, you and Dagen -- we all know how bad it was in New York in those, you know -- we're a long way from that. But it's certainly not the kind of trend you want to see right now.
BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, we don't know how far we are from that. It definitely does feel different on the ground in New York City right now with all of this tension around this crime and murders -- 39 murders, year 2020 in June so far.
Let's take a break.
When we come back, welcome to Parler. I'm speaking with CEO John Matze on how it plans to compete with Twitter. We will talk about business of apps.
Plus what a deal. Patrick Mahomes signed the largest deal in NFL history. The eye-popping number coming up.
You are watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA, live on Fox Business.
BARTIROMO: Welcome back.
COVID-19 side effects. A bedrock of the U.S. economy now on life support, struggling through the coronavirus pandemic and recession. Gerri Willis is now here with the details. Gerri -- good morning.
GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Hey. Good morning -- Maria. That is right.
The healthcare industry on life support due to the double whammy of COVID- 19 and the recession.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
WILLIS: Health care normally resistant to economic cycles but not this time.
DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN ACTION FORUM: In the first quarter of quart 2020, when GDP fell at a 5 percent annual rate, 2 percentage points of that were from people using fewer health services. They stopped going to the doctor.
WILLIS: Worst yet experts predict 27 million people will lose employer- sponsored health care coverage this year. And that will mean incredible pressures on our health care system. Who will cover the new jobless and how will we pay at a time states are underfunded?
Dr. Ezequiel Emanuel, a former President Obama adviser examined health care systems in 11 countries to write his new book, ""Which country has the World's Best Health Care"" and suggests emulating single payer systems in countries like Germany and the Netherlands.
He writes, ""Individuals choose their own insurer and the government pays most of the premium, risk-adjusted to reflect the patient's age, sex and state of health.""
But Doug Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum suggests a more targeted approach such as government health and extending employer- sponsored COBRA coverage or a special enrolment period for the Affordable Care Act.
HOLTZ-EAKIN: I don't think the state sponsor solution is the answer. We have seen the debate over Medicare for all for example. The extreme end point of a state-sponsored solution. And one of the things you learn in following that debate is people like their employer-sponsored insurance.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
WILLIS: The debate will likely continue Maria, but the stakes will get higher this fall as more people search for coverage -- Maria.
BARTIROMO: All right. Gerri, thank you. Gerri Willis on health care.
We'll slip in a break.
When we come back markets are pointing to a triple-digit loss at the start of trading this morning after a record run yesterday. What is driving markets with the Dow futures down 212 points this morning.
Then Bubba's big break. The NASCAR star has a new musical related deal. Much more ahead.
Stay with us.
BARTIROMO: Welcome back.
Taking on Chinese tech. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last night that the U.S. is considering banning Tiktok and other Chinese social media apps. Tiktok just released a statement to Fox Business saying this. ""Tiktok is led by an American CEO with hundreds of employees and key leaders across safety security product and public policy here in the United States. We have no higher priority than promoting a safe and secure app experience for our users. We have never provided user data to the Chinese government nor would we do so if asked.
Joining me right now is former Nebraska Senator, Allen and Company managing director, former Democratic presidential candidate, former Navy Seal, and former 9/11 Commission member Bob Kerrey.
Senator, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thank you so much for being here.
BOB KERREY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, ALLEN AND COMPANY: You're welcome. Nice to have so many of formers in front of my titles.
BARTIROMO: We have been talking a lot these last several days and weeks about China and about the national security threat. When you hear Tiktok say look, even if we were asked by the Chinese Communist Party to give user data we won't do it. What is your reaction?
KERREY: Well, it's hard to trust the answer. So I don't know. I mean I would have to be read into more precise information as to whether or not they do it. It's hard to take their assurance at face value.
BARTIROMO: Well, it is hard to believe, hat they would not be forced to hand over data. I don't care who the CEO is. The CEO is former executive from Disney. If the CCP comes calling and says send us that data, you are going to send that data.
And this morning a lot of Wall Street firms are talking about this as well. Apparently, Hong Kong has asserted this new national security law but with it has policing powers including, get this, warrantless searches, online surveillance and property seizures under the new security law with the city's CEO Carrie Lam saying that this law will be enforced very stringently and people's concerns will be eased.
She reaffirmed that much of the implementation of the law would be managed in secret, saying that a committee created to oversee it would not release details from future meetings.
Your reaction to this new security law that is being implemented in Hong Kong, born in China.
KERREY: Well, it certainly kills the freedom movement inside of Hong Kong. I mean the desire for just limited democracy and capacity to form their own government is, I think, been obliterated. And Xi Jinping has taken advantage of the global pandemic to seize control of the island. It's not the same anymore. And they can pretend that it is the same but it's not.
They have taken control and it was -- yes, it was a source of great strengthen for the country, for China. And you know, for whatever the reason, Xi Jinping has made one more overreach, in my view that will, in the end, damage China.
BARTIROMO: Yes. And certainly, change Hong Kong, breaking another promise there.
(CROSSTALK).
BARTIROMO: Let me switch gears to talk a bit about domestic issues. And that is Joe Biden's vice president sweepstake heating up. Pressure is mounting on the presumptive 2020 Democratic nominee to choose a black woman as his VP candidate given the racial unrest facing this country.
Senator, as somebody who was vetted to be a vice presidential pick for Bill Clinton back in 1992, what can you tell us about the process and who you think Biden will ultimately choose?
KERREY: Well, it's a completely different process today. I mean, in 1992, you know, we didn't have cell phones with cameras and we did not have access to all kinds of additional information whether it's, you know, it's Facebook or Web sites and all that sort of thing. So, you know, you could - - I can fly down to Little Rock and you know go inside governor's mansion and have a conversation with very few people knowing I was there.
So the intensity of the focus is much greater. And I am sure the vice president's very much aware that the number that is most important to him is 270. So he has to get 270 electoral votes regardless of all the other, you know, can't you get somebody that has this, that or the other characteristic. The most important thing for any president who is running to either be elected or reelected is 270.
And my guess is that's going to be a primary consideration. It is also true for actually both for he and the President that they have to think about -- you know, I will just put it this way, if I or anybody over the age of 70 goes to sleep tonight and dies in her sleep, the first thing that people are not going to say tomorrow morning is that was a surprise.
So Joe -- anybody picking a vice president who's over the age of 70 has got to sit there and say, what happens if -- suddenly they become president of the United States. Do they have the capacity to do it? I'm sure that Joe is thinking that way in addition to thinking about 270 electoral votes.
BARTIROMO: I know. I think you make a great point because it may very well be that --
(CROSSTALK)
KERREY: It's exactly the point.
BARTIROMO: -- whoever he chooses as vice president will become president in no time.
Now as somebody with moderate views like yourself, how will you go about bridging this bipartisan divide that we have in Washington right now, nothing seems to be able to get done because each side hates each other.
KERREY: Well, there is no question, that it's more than just partisan, it is polarization that's occurred. The sort of a stacking on the issues kind of made it more difficult for a Democrat to move to the middle or a Republican to move to the middle because they get they get trashed by the extremes.
And if you're going to get immigration done. If you can't economic policy right. If you begin health care. There's a number of issues where if -- all you do is push a Democrat or a Republican proposal, you simply are not going to get the votes. You're going to have gridlock and you're going to have frustration with American people.
BARTIROMO: do you think that mail-in voting works? What are THE other main issues we need to think about going into the election?
KERREY: Well I think you've got to have I would say two things. I mean ""The Wall Street Journal"" had an editorial last week where they described the simple things that need to be done. The first one is you've got to have enough polling places. If people go out and vote there's got to be enough polling places, don't have to stand in line for hours.
And secondly, when the votes are -- when the mail-in ballots start arriving, start counting. Don't wait until the election, the day of the election to start counting because if you do you're going to get a delay in yo9ur capacity to announce who the winner is.
Already we're were sitting in a situation with -- in New York state. So I think it is really important that you do the simple things to be prepared for the election.
BARTIROMO: Senator -- it's great to see you this morning. Thank you so much, sir. Thank you for your --
(CROSSTALK).
KERREY: Nice to be here with you.
BARTIROMO: Senator Bob Kerrey on all of -- and to you. Thank you, sir.
Coming up, a major health warning. Florida on high alert this morning after a deadly brain-eating amoeba identified in the state. We are taking a look at that.
And then welcome to Parler. I'll be speaking with CEO John Matze next on how it plans to compete with Twitter. We'll talk social media right after this.
BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Tuesday, July 7th. Markets this morning, 8:30 AM Eastern, are trading lower. Take a look at where we stand about an hour away from the opening bell.
Futures pulling back after yesterday's big rally. The DOW right now down 233 points. NASDAQ Futures down 34 and the S&P Futures down 23. This after a huge day yesterday that the saw NASDAQ hit a 24th record close of the year; 150 (ph) under President Trump. Take a look at yesterday's performance with the NASDAQ at an all-time high, up better than 200 points.
Checking global markets this morning; it is red across the board. European Indices are down, take a look. The FTSE 100 down 97, the CAC quarante down 58 and the DAX index in Germany lower by 167. This right here is the low of the morning for Euro. The Euro Zone is heading toward a deeper recession than previously thought, according to the EU. In Asia, overnight, markets were mostly lower except for China where stocks rose following yesterday's rally, after a state-run media said that China needs a healthy bull market and is ready to add support to attract investors. With that, millions of retail investors in China opened accounts.
NASCAR standing behind Bubba Wallace meanwhile after President Trump tweeted ""The rope shaped like a noose in his garage was a hoax."" Cheryl Casone with the details now. Cheryl?
CASONE: That's right, Maria. President Trump suggested that Bubba Wallace should apologize after NASCAR rallied around him when that rope was found in his garage at Talladega Superspeedway last month. Now, the President said it was a hoax and he also questioned NASCAR's move to ban the Confederate flag. While Wallace who is NASCAR's only black driver fired back on Twitter writing in part, "" Love should come naturally as people are TAUGHT to hate. Even when it's hate from POTUS...love wins.""
While the FBI determine the rope was not a hate crime and had been in the garage since October, NASCAR released a statement yesterday praising Wallace for his courage and his leadership. Beats by Dre is also showing their support for Wallace, announcing a new endorsement deal with the driver a week early in response to the President's comments.
Well, a victory for Native Americans after a federal judge ordered the Dakota Access Pipeline be shut down and emptied pending an environmental review. The judge specifically called out the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe staged protests that sometimes were violent during the pipeline's construction, claiming it will contaminate the Missouri River. The $3.8 billion pipeline, which spans more than 1100 miles underground, has been an operation now for three years. The environmental review must be done within 30 days. This ruling, a setback for the Trump Administration's efforts to speed up pipeline projects by cutting red tape and environmental studies.
And here's a look at what's trending this morning on foxbusiness.com, the Kansas City Chiefs signed Super Bowl MVP quarterback Patrick Mahomes to a ten-year extension worth up to $503 million, making up the richest contract in sports history and the first time ever an NFL player became the world's highest paid athlete.
The National Gallery of Art purchases its first painting by a Native American artist and there it is on your screen. And finally, there is this; Dunkin' is testing new bubble teas, summer shandies, which is tea or cold coffee with lemonade or other fruit, and vitamin-loaded refreshers at select (ph) locations at Massachusetts that goes from July 1 to August 18, Maria, and those are your headlines from the newsroom, back over to you.
BARTIROMO: And if we were together, we would probably be trying that out right now.
CASONE: Of course, we would.
BARTIROMO: Thanks, Cheryl. Well, the alternative to Twitter, Parler Launched in 2018 setting out to be an unbiased social media platform, free of censorship and promoting free speech. Since its inception, Parler has grown each year with over 600,000 total accounts last year and over two million accounts this year. Prominent Republicans flocking to the app including Eric Trump, Rudy Giuliani, senators Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Congressmen Kevin McCarthy and Devin Nunes.
Joining me right now is the CEO of Parler, John Matze. John, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us. Congratulations to you.
JOHN MATZE, CEO, PARLER: Thank you. Thank you.
BARTIROMO: Tell me how you are going to keep to all that - no censorship, free speech. I mean obviously, we've got lots of issues around the current group of social media companies like Twitter keeps pushing back against President Trump, but doesn't do the same with similar speech from others who are critics of the President; similar story with Google. How are you going to increase and make sure that Parler remains free of any meddling?
MATZE: Well, we've been focusing on that real problems and trying to drown out a lot of the noise that has been going on. Basically, our rules are really clear, and they are set with different FCC guidelines. These are not requirements; we don't need to follow them, but we opting into them.
Things like pornography and nudity, we keep off the platform, but if people have a disagreement, they are allowed to talk about it and they can have a discussion. And so, the concept is to create a Town Square where people are having realistic discussion, where it reflects their genuine views and they can do that without getting into this nasty internet content that you see on other places by basically ensuring people are real.
BARTIROMO: This is a really important point that you are making and you are right. We wanted just a platform - in 1996, with the Telecom Act which pretty much gave the social media companies the privilege of having a platform as an explainer of who they are and that allowed them to get protection in terms of getting sued by people, that is obviously now potentially changing with DOJ's proposal to remove that protection. Assess the situation for us, John, before moving on to explaining specifically about Parler, how do you see the social media situation today? Is there truth that there is censorship?
MATZE: I think they are censoring, I don't think they believe they are, and I don't know that they would admit that they are. But, it is pretty clear that they are behaving like publications and that is really where the problem comes down to, is they are telling you they are an open community forum for people to get on and then they are behaving like publications, choosing what gets to reach its audience and what doesn't.
And so, from that perspective, I think that is why it has created a lot of political problems for them. And that is why it has been getting worse and worse. And really to be honest, we are kind of probably a good thing for them because it shows that there is a marketplace where people can choose different platforms and that we can effectively get into this market and make a splash which has been really nice, this year and even last year too. And so, in a way, this is really the answer to a lot of those problems.
BARTIROMO: Yes, well, I will tell you, I joined, I am will at - on Parler. But, how do you keep this app from becoming the other side of Twitter or essentially a Trump rally? That was a criticism raised in a recent article in Politico, how do you broaden out your user base? And tell us your business model; how do you make money?
MATZE: Well, frankly a lot of these media outlets like to write articles about us like that; they unhappy that we have such a large audience now. That Politico article I think was very unfair. We have a lot of people coming on with different viewpoints because they are kind of tired of sitting there, going - look at this is where all these people I want to argue with are in debate and so they are going to join, and you are seeing diversity as a result of that.
In terms of monetizing, since I last kind of spoke about it, we've seen a tremendous amount of interest in advertising. The only thing we haven't done is actually been able to sell them because we've been too busy focusing on growing our platform. So - I mean we have seen up to $50,000 a day in ad sales which is really great and really promising but as we grow, this is going to get earn better and bigger. And as we continue to make this more advanced ad network, it is going to be very, very nice for people.
BARTIROMO: So, tell me what the growth plan is, how do you continue to grow in the coming five years? What is the strategy?
MATZE: Well, I am focusing on the near-term right now; that's our big thing, is we want to make sure that the service is fast and that it is working well and that everybody gets to reach their audience. And as long as we can provide that, within the next year, I can see us growing another 10x from current capacity.
Especially as the political situation when it comes to online censorship with Twitter and Facebook and all these other places, they continue to hamper down on conservatives with this ad boycott and everything that's going on, I'm curious to see what is going to happen with people like the President of the United States or other political leaders who want to have a fair discussion.
And this is not just in the United States. Last week, we had large influx of people from Brazil. The President of Brazil joined our platform, and now we've got - Netanyahu joined this week from Israel. So, we are getting a lot of people from different countries around the world, not just the United States, that are experiencing the same issues with Twitter and other big tech companies.
BARTIROMO: I mean it is creepy to know that you post something and then you don't see it for days in some cases. Is that shadow banning? I mean they say that they don't shadow ban and yet it feels like something is going on. They blame things on the algorithms. But, honestly, John, somebody is programming those algorithms.
MATZE: Well, there's inherent bias in whoever programmed the algorithm. It's probably a handful of engineers, very small subset of people that are actually writing that code. And if they're not very careful, and they don't hyper focus on keeping it really clean and pure, they're going to have issues.
Like what we did is we just made it chronological and so the idea is you opt into what you see. A lot of these other companies, what they like to do is try to reprioritize your news and your feed based off of what they think that you want to see in order to give you a ""a better user experience."" But in reality, what it's doing is it's kind of creating this concept that if they don't think other people want to see your content, it's not going to show up to other people. And so you're not going to reach your audience who opted in to following you.
BARTIROMO: That's exactly right. So you just named a number of high profile people who've joined Parler. Do you feel like you're getting a group - liberal voices as well as conservatives? Do you feel like you're broadening out to the broader public?
MATZE: Yes, I think we are. I don't think it's as quick, obviously, but we are seeing a lot of people coming on there. And some of them are just there to make nasty comments about how awful we are, and then tell us that they're organizing groups to make bad App Store reviews for us, because I've seen that too, unfortunately.
But we also get some people coming in there for debate. They're going, you know, look at why are these people joining? I want to have a conversation with them. I want to find out what they're talking about and what they're trying to do, and they're coming in. So there is genuine interest there as well. Not just in the conservative community, but I think it's going to be a little bit of a long-term before they really start joining in more mass.
BARTIROMO: Well, I know that most conservatives want to see this problem fixed by market share, by capitalism and the markets working, so you're obviously taking market share. We'll be watching John. Congrats to you. We hope you'll come back soon. Thank you, sir.
MATZE: Thank you. Take care.
BARTIROMO: John Matze, joining us there. Check out Parler.com.
Fox Business alert right now, United Airlines is warning of potential furloughs as it sees bookings decline due to travel restrictions. According to ""The Wall Street Journal"" this morning, the airline says that bookings began to slide in June after New York, New Jersey and Connecticut announced a 14-day quarantine from a variety of coronavirus hotspots. The stock is down 3 percent right now on this news. United Airlines is going to be one to watch this morning with a decline of better than $1 a share.
Coming up, the state of unemployment. People getting more money from the government than from working. We're taking a look at that.
You are watching ""Mornings with Maria"" live on Fox Business
BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Cracking down on unemployment fraud, some getting the unemployment COVID boost, despite not qualifying for the benefits. A group of former employees at one business now accused of cheating the system. Kristina Partsinevelos is with us. Now is there this morning. Good morning, Christina.
KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS: Good morning, Maria. What we're seeing is you have months of lockdown for a lot of these businesses and now they're facing a new predicament. They struggle to find workers, like you said.
I'm standing in front of Morton Williams, a New York's grocery chain, and the corner says that many of his former employees are taking advantage of the system. Morton Williams has about 16 locations across the entire city. And the Co-owner, we spoke with him, and he said that many of those employees are trying to file for unemployment benefits even though they do not qualify and this comes at a time when he's struggling to find workers. Listen him.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
AVI KANER, MORTON WILLIAMS CO-OWNER: Over the past four months we've let go off maybe three or four people total. Can you imagine that three or four people total in our entire chain of 1,200 people? We now have 600 unemployment claims, of which 160 have already been paid. It's - you know, it's just mind boggling.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PARTSINEVELOS: If an employee gets fired or is like oh, for other reasons, they do not qualify for those unemployment benefits. And yet, if they still get them, then that can be considered fraud.
We reached out to New York State to get information about this particular story and they responded saying, ""Unemployment benefits are a lifeline for New Yorkers who lose their jobs and it is unacceptable that dishonest individuals would seek to defraud the system for their own gain. Make no mistake, attempting to cheat the unemployment system is a crime and we investigate all reports of fraud.""
Americans may be staying home because of course of health concerns, caregiving, but also because their combined income of the benefits is more than their income before the pandemic. We know that the federal government is giving out $600. At the state level it varies. Minimum amount here in New York is $172.
Economists at the University of Chicago found that 70 percent of eligible workers are making more money post pandemic off of those benefits than before. And we have a situation even in Texas and Maria, I'm going to end with this.
So, 46,000 Texans are being asked to give back their unemployment benefits to the tune of about $32 million, because they either received it because of error or because of fraud. And so this comes at a time when we're trying - businesses trying to rehire workers, deal with the paperwork about unemployment claims, and then possibly have to deal with increases in unemployment insurance rates, all at a time when doors are open, but business is far from pre-COVID levels. Back to you.
BARTIROMO: That was an incredible soundbite that you played from Morton Williams CEO that they have laid off two or three people--
PARTSINEVELOS: Yes.
BARTIROMO: And they got 600 applications for unemployment benefits. Kristina, thank you.
PARTSINEVELOS: Exactly.
BARTIROMO: Kristina Partsinevelos in New York City this morning.
Coming up, a major health warning. Florida on high alert this morning after a deadly brain eating Amoeba identified in the state. We're taking a look when we come right back. Stay with us.
BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Coronavirus is not the only worry in Florida. This morning, officials there have issued a statewide warning confirming a case of a very rare and deadly brain eating amoeba - the tiny amoeba, typically found in warm fresh water like lakes, rivers and ponds.
Joining us right now is family medicine, Dr. Jen Caudle. Dr. Caudle, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks very much for being here. So what should we be aware of?
JEN CAUDLE, FAMILY MEDICINE DOCTOR: Thank you. Yes, so well, first thing to know is that this is an amoeba. This is not a virus, it's not a bacteria. And you're right, it's found in warm freshwater lakes, rivers, as you mentioned. It can also be found in swimming pools that are not properly maintained, even hot springs.
But the thing that you mentioned is it is sort of a brain eating Amoeba, which means it causes a condition called primary amebic meningoencephalitis, which is a brain infection. That's right. It gets in through the nose into the body, travels to the brain and actually destroys brain. So that's one of the really sort of tragic things about this.
Maria, before we go on. I do want to give people some good news. Even though this is a very deadly condition, over 97 percent fatality rate. It is very rare. And that's a really good thing to know.
BARTIROMO: So you said that it goes into the nose. How do people get infected?
CAUDLE: That's right.
BARTIROMO: Is this just a sneeze or cough? And is there a cure?
CAUDLE: That's a great question. So you can't get this by drinking contaminated water or anything like that. You can't get this from, say, oceans, because again, it's fresh water. It's typically acquired from swimming or diving in warm bodies of fresh water.
So what happens is sort of that force in going into the water, when the water goes into the nose, that's where it allows that amoeba to travel into the brain. The ways that we want you to prevent it are, of course, you can - avoiding warm bodies of fresh water, right? Swimming or doing activities and lakes and rivers, et cetera and things like that.
But also, other ways of prevention would include holding your nose or using nose clips, and things like that. Of course, nothing is necessarily a 100 percent. This amoeba is found in lots of bodies of water. Once again, the good thing is it is very rare. The CDC says there have only been 145 reported cases between 1962 and 2018.
But on the flipside, as I mentioned before, there's over a 97 percent mortality rate. Of those 145 only four have survived. So the treatment is pretty complicated. The treatments are not the best, and I still think they're kind of a work in progress.
I think the most important thing for people to know is if they have symptoms of nausea, vomiting, headache, high fever, seizures, mental status changes, they feel dizzy, confused symptoms that are not right after swimming or honestly in any other time, you need to see your doctor promptly.
BARTIROMO: You said that this also could happen in pools that are not maintained. So what does that mean for chlorine in pools. It's summertime, it's also tick season. Experts are also figuring an unusually bad season amid the coronavirus, so talk to us about what we're dealing with in terms of the summertime chlorine in the pools and tick season.
CAUDLE: Yes. So the most important thing for those of you who have pools or when you're going to a local pool or things like that, it's important for that pool to be properly maintained, which means making sure it's properly cleaned, disinfected, chlorinated, and things like that.
If a pool is properly maintained, we have very little concern, OK. It's when those pools are not properly maintained that we certainly get concerned for things like this amoeba and another things.
Tick disease, Lyme disease, rather, avoid ticks. Make sure that you're wearing bug spray. You know, all of those prevention methods are really, really important for the summertime.
BARTIROMO: All right, Dr. Jen Caudle, great to get your insights this morning. Thanks so much. We will see you soon. Jen. Thank you.
CAUDLE: Thank you.
BARTIROMO: Quick break and then more ""Mornings with Maria."" Right after this.
BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Markets down about 200 points. Opening bell about 30 minutes from now. Dagen McDowell, Jon Hilsenrath, Michael Kantrowitz, great to see you. Thank you so much for being here.
DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS: Thank you."

with their family or friends or colleagues at work. That is why they need to sometimes go out and meet people who are in the same position or share similar stories. It is very vital to have these spaces. When this outbreak became public the South Korean Government wants to track and trace everyone who is infected to try to stop the virus spreading. 
Why was that a real problem? These clubs and bars took the visitors' and customers' names and cell phone numbers and where they live. A lot of the people did not write the information correctly because of the fear of being outed because once they are tracked down and tested and if the results were positive then the information will be on the Internet. Just enough information for people to guess who these people are. I can see the struggle for you because you are talking about risk. You are talking about a risk to public health. People do not give their names. You are also talking about a risk of being outed. Are you feeling a struggle or some people have a real struggle with this? There are a lot of friends of mine, even artists or activists, many of them are not out, they still have to lie about their sexuality or sexual orientation to their family, their parents. Before coronavirus do you think things were getting easier, when you talk about Pride gatherings or parades in Seoul for example? Was that possible? Were those gatherings getting bigger before the virus? In general things seemed to be going well and going towards the right direction because I had been going to the festival for ten years, first time I went there the size of it was approximately 2000 or 3000 people but last year they had over 120,000 people. The size of it has become really big. There has been more media coverage in general. Mainstream media and K-Pop even. Things seemed to be going in the right direction. Then the outbreak happened. People had to face the fact that things were not actually as good as they seemed, or there had always been problems. You are watching coronavirus: Your Stories. This week we are looking at the virus and prejudice. Next, a young photographer in New York City sees a rise in abuse directed at Asian American faces. I was waiting in line to enter a grocery store after the shelter in place order was officially announced in New York City. There were clear signs for social distancing but the man behind me was hovering right behind me. I could almost feel his breath. He did not have a mask on. I politely asked him for some space to which he responded BLEEP and proceeded to cut in front of me. At this point I was already anticipating prejudice and increase in hate crimes against Asian-Americans as Trump had made his first reference to a Chinese virus about four days prior to my incidents. I also wanted to believe that my experience was an isolated incident since I live in such a racially and culturally diverse city. This happened to you and then you start asking around and realise this is not an isolated incident. Right. I started to realise that there was a pattern of these incidents. I started to do some research. I found several Asian-Americans were self reporting"

It's time we take them head on.",FALSE,"Nov 03, 2020( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex) The nation's largest police union used a two-year-old boy — whose mother had just violently thrown to the ground by Philadelphia police after breaking her car's windows — as a prop in a social media post. Under a ""Blue Lives Matter"" banner, police unions demand hate crime protections while rolling their eyes at ""systemic racism"" or a pervasive culture of police acting like troops occupying a hostile nation. During the months of protests over racism and police brutality, talk of ""defunding the police"" distracted the national conversation from more practical, broadly popular reforms.Meanwhile, police unions all over the country quietly snuffed out attempts at minor, incremental reforms. Police unions are their industry's grievance lobbyists. 
We need to demand local lawmakers in both parties get some courage and take them on. This is an opinion column. The thoughts expressed are those of the author. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[1].The nation's largest police union used a two-year-old boy — whose mother had just violently thrown to the ground by Philadelphia police after breaking her car's windows — as a prop in a social media post. The family's lawyer called the post ""propaganda...using racism and fear.""More than five months after the death of George Floyd at the hands of police, this story out of Philadelphia served as a timely reminder of why police unions remain the greatest impediment to meaningful and lasting criminal justice reform.After months of protest, some reforms have been passed[2], like bans on chokeholds and increased body camera requirements. But all these reforms are opposed by police unions. In New York, police unions are fighting basic efforts[3] at greater transparency regarding officers' disciplinary records.Unfortunately, the protests have had little effect on actual policy. And nothing's going to change unless citizens demand that local lawmakers[4] — of both major parties — resist police unions' influence and deflate their political power. Police beat an innocent woman and then exploited her baby During a protest following the death of Walter Wallace, Jr., a Black man whose shooting by Philadelphia police[5] was captured on video, a 28-year-old woman made a wrong turn[6] into an area where police were confronting protesters last week.As she tried to turn her car around and flee, nightstick-wielding officers surrounded her car and busted up the windows. Then they yanked her and her 16-year-old nephew from the glass-strewn vehicle and threw them both violently to the ground.While the woman was bleeding out of her head, another cop took her two-year-old son to ""safety."" The whole thing was caught on video[7]. (The woman was later released without charges, but she did have to get medical treatment at a hospital.)At some point during the fracas, someone snapped a photo[8] of the terrified baby clinging to a concerned-looking female police officer. The National Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) — the largest police union in the country — posted the photo with a caption that deserves to be judged in its totality:""This child was lost during the violent riots in Philadelphia, wandering around barefoot in an area that was experiencing complete lawlessness. The only thing this Philadelphia police officer cared about in that moment was protecting this child.We are not your enemy. We are the Thin Blue Line. And we ARE the only thing standing between Order and Anarchy.""The woman's lawyer, Riley H. Ross III, called[9] the post a ""lie"" and a ""blatant attempt to use our clients to peddle propaganda by using racism and fear[10] to force compliance."" Police unions can't fix the problem because they are the problem While the idea of a union is to protect the interests of workers, police unions have demonstrated a willingness to take this to a level that's decidedly not in the best interests of the public. They myopically defend the worst officers, resist any reasonable attempts to increase accountability or curb their ability to act as extralegal enforcers, and ridiculously depict police officers as a besieged minority in need of hate crime legal protections.Seriously, that's what Blue Lives Matter[11] is. While rolling eyes at the mere mention of ""systemic racism,"" or the pervasive culture of police in the US[12] acting like they're troops occupying a hostile nation, police unions are their industry's grievance lobbyists.That's how you get police unions in New York completely fabricating a story[13] about Shake Shack employees allegedly poisoning officers. They need to push the fictions that being a police officer is a uniquely dangerous profession (which it isn't, not even close[14]) and that it's in the public interest if police approach every interaction with civilians with the utmost fear and force.A report from the US Conference of Mayors[15] this August said that police unions' political power has led to collective bargaining agreements that curtail independent investigations into alleged police abuse, purge or otherwise obscure disciplinary records, and resist attempts to better train officers in de-escalation tactics. Mayors are telling us flatly: We'd like to help, but the unions have contracts.During the months of protests over racism and police brutality, talk of ""defunding the police[16]"" dominated the national conversation. It quietly failed in Minneapolis[17], where George Floyd was killed.Meanwhile, police unions[18] all over the country[19] have quietly snuffed out[20] attempts at minor, incremental reforms. And there's an entire industry[21] built on training police in a ""warrior"" mentality and lobbying for more and more instruments of war in the hands of local police. (A recently surfaced Kentucky State Police training slideshow[22] is literally titled, ""The Warrior Mindset,"" features three Adolf Hitler quotes[23] about using violence as a tool for success, and really needs to be seen to believed[24].)Despite the protests and public opinion on the side of reform, the warrior cop industry continues its work unabated.This is all far less publicized, which is how the police unions like it. They'd prefer us all to flip out over the radical and wholly impractical[25] proposition of ""defunding the police[26],"" while they dig in their heels behind the scenes.It's a shame and a waste of the energies of a massive protest movement that when non-violent[27], remains overwhelmingly popular.The movement to reform police should be conducted with laser-focused efforts to decrease police unions' political power and influence.On the state and local level — the only places where real reform can take place — Republicans need to be challenged[28] on their fealty to police and Democrats need to be challenged on their fealty to public sector unions.Police unions can't be trusted to reform themselves, and judging by their participation in spreading hoaxes and willingness to use a two-year-old boy to propagate a ""compassionate warrior"" image, they can't be trusted to even tell you the truth in front of your own two eyes.

Nita Lowey (D-NY) News Release",FALSE,"WASHINGTON, DC - Congresswoman Lowey (D-NY17/Rockland-Westchester), Chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, and the Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee, today approved by voice vote the Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 Homeland Security funding bill. The $50.72 billion proposal includes $10.8 billion for Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and $3.66 billion for Federal Assistance, which includes funding for the Urban Areas Security Initiative (UASI) Nonprofit Security Grants and the newer non-UASI Nonprofit Security Grants within the State Homeland Security Grant Program (NSGP-S) that Chairwoman Lowey created in FY 2018. The increases of $473.9 million above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $1.18 billion above the President's budget request for Federal Assistance include record-level funding for the nonprofit security grants.
""In response to the rise in anti-Semitic incidents and violent hate crimes, our draft bill quadruples funds for nonprofits and religious institutions to help prevent and protect against terrorism and targeted, violent extremism,"" said Congresswoman Lowey. ""The record funding for nonprofit security grants in both UASI and non-UASI regions would enable the Westchester, Rockland, and the broader New York nonprofit community to protect themselves with increased security measures and greater peace of mind so that they can gather safely. It brings me great pride to know that a program I created is helping to keep children and families safe and secure across the Lower Hudson Valley. As the appropriations process continues, I will keep fighting to bring home increased funding for New York.""
Combined funding for nonprofit security grants in both UASI (NSGP-U) and non-UASI regions (NSGP-S) was $90 million in FY 2020. The House Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee approved a combined funding level of $360 million in the FY 2021 bill, which would be an increase of $270 million, or a quadrupling of funding, for nonprofit security grants. Individually, NSGP-S would receive a record $180 million in FY 2021, marking a $140 million increase from $40 million in FY 2020. The NSGP-U would receive a record $180 million in FY 2021, which would be a $130 million increase from $50 million in FY 2020. The bill is expected to be considered by the full Appropriations Committee in the coming days.
In FY 2018, Congresswoman Lowey successfully created the Nonprofit Security Grant Program carve-out within the State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP) to support nonprofit organizations located outside of UASI-designated urban areas, such as Rockland County. The new program was originally funded at $10 million in FY 2018. As Chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, Congresswoman Lowey was instrumental in securing an increase of $30 million in FY 2020 to support nonprofit security. Last week, the Congresswoman announced that at least 25 organizations in the 17th Congressional District will receive a total of $2,565,028 of those federal funds.

But Wild Mountain Thyme, a new Hollywood film starring Jamie Dornan and Emily Blunt, has been ridiculed for the stars' doomed attempt at Irish accents, and for perpetuating national stereotypes. At one point, Dornan's character proposes to a donkey.
If a sign were needed that the film had overdone the Irish cliches, the National Leprechaun Museum in Dublin was moved to tweet: ""Even we think this is a bit much.""
The release of the trailer on social media was greeted with hilarity by the Irish, and bafflement that Dornan's accent is so bad when he was born in Co Down, Northern Ireland.
""These accents constitute a hate crime,"" said one viewer. And another wrote: ""They're lucky this came out the week of voting Biden in, or else it could cause an international incident.""
The Twitter account for Dublin Airport also joined in, posting: ""There's fashion police. Grammar police. We even have airport police. Is there such a thing as accent police? If so, somebody better call 'em.""
A feature about the film in the Irish Times was headlined: ""What in the name of holy bejaysus is this cowpat?""
Even the Irish Embassy in Washington DC decided to comment, tweeting: ""To be fair, Irish accents are hard (we struggle with them at times). But otherwise Wild Mountain Thyme looks great. And, in Jamie Dornan and Emily Blunt, presents a remarkably realistic depiction, visually at least, of the average Irish man and woman. Truly, we are a beautiful people.""
Blunt and Dornan star as Rosemary Muldoon and Anthony Reilly, who grow up on neighbouring farms in the bucolic Irish countryside.
Rosemary secretly loves Anthony but he is oblivious to her feelings. She has her head turned by Anthony's American cousin, played by Jon Hamm, the only character wisely retaining his own accent. Anthony's father is played by Christopher Walken.
The film is directed by John Patrick Shanley, who was Oscar-nominated in 2008 for Doubt and whose writing credits include the 1980s hit Moonstruck. It is based on his own play, Outside Mullingar, which had its Broadway debut in 2014.
When Wild Mountain Thyme was announced earlier this year, Blunt called it ""undeniably the most beautifully written script I read in a long time."" The British actress, who lives in New York, said she and Dornan were both terrified at the prospect of mastering the Irish accent.
In a joint interview with People magazine, Dornan said: ""I'm actually from about 120 miles where the movie is set, and Emily, there's an ocean between her and where the movie is set. Or the Irish Sea, certainly. So it was definitely easier for me, but she's amazing.""
Blunt said she had found it tougher than Dornan did ""but he assured me that I sounded Irish and I'm going to believe him. So if he's wrong, I'm going to blame him for any backlash on my accent. He has assured me it was a great Irish accent.""
The film is due for release in the US next month. A UK date has not been set."

with their family or friends or colleagues at work. That is why they need to sometimes go out and meet people who are in the same position or share similar stories. It is very vital to have these spaces. When this outbreak became public the South Korean Government wants to track and trace everyone who is infected to try to stop the virus spreading. 
Why was that a real problem? These clubs and bars took the visitors' and customers' names and cell phone numbers and where they live. A lot of the people did not write the information correctly because of the fear of being outed because once they are tracked down and tested and if the results were positive then the information will be on the Internet. Just enough information for people to guess who these people are. I can see the struggle for you because you are talking about risk. You are talking about a risk to public health. People do not give their names. You are also talking about a risk of being outed. Are you feeling a struggle or some people have a real struggle with this? There are a lot of friends of mine, even artists or activists, many of them are not out, they still have to lie about their sexuality or sexual orientation to their family, their parents. Before coronavirus do you think things were getting easier, when you talk about Pride gatherings or parades in Seoul for example? Was that possible? Were those gatherings getting bigger before the virus? In general things seemed to be going well and going towards the right direction because I had been going to the festival for ten years, first time I went there the size of it was approximately 2000 or 3000 people but last year they had over 120,000 people. The size of it has become really big. There has been more media coverage in general. Mainstream media and K-Pop even. Things seemed to be going in the right direction. Then the outbreak happened. People had to face the fact that things were not actually as good as they seemed, or there had always been problems. You are watching coronavirus: Your Stories. This week we are looking at the virus and prejudice. Next, a young photographer in New York City sees a rise in abuse directed at Asian American faces. I was waiting in line to enter a grocery store after the shelter in place order was officially announced in New York City. There were clear signs for social distancing but the man behind me was hovering right behind me. I could almost feel his breath. He did not have a mask on. I politely asked him for some space to which he responded BLEEP and proceeded to cut in front of me. At this point I was already anticipating prejudice and increase in hate crimes against Asian-Americans as Trump had made his first reference to a Chinese virus about four days prior to my incidents. I also wanted to believe that my experience was an isolated incident since I live in such a racially and culturally diverse city. This happened to you and then you start asking around and realise this is not an isolated incident. Right. I started to realise that there was a pattern of these incidents. I started to do some research. I found several Asian-Americans were self reporting"

Also known as Weezy, Lil Wayne has recorded 12 albums that hit the top ten on the Billboard 200 charts. Lil Wayne has met with Trump, but he has not officially endorsed Trump's re-election campaign. The Platinum Plan promises to provide $500 billion to the Black community.
""Just had a great meeting with @realdonaldtrump @potus besides what he's done so far with criminal reform, the platinum plan is going to give the community real ownership,"" Lil Wayne tweeted. ""He listened to what we had to say today and assured he will and can get it done.""
In 2010, Lil Wayne served almost 8 months at the Rikers Island Correctional Facility in New York after a loaded firearm was discovered on his tour bus in 2007.
Weezy is not the only rap artist to speak highly of the Platinum Plan. In October, performer Ice Cube said that he had met with both Republicans and Democrats concerning the plan. Cube implied that the Republicans made changes to the Platinum Plan based on his suggestions.
Joe Biden is expected to carry the Black vote, a traditional stronghold of the Democratic Party, which has been invigorated by nationwide protests against police brutality. However high-profile Trump endorsements from Black celebrities may dent Biden's margins. In recent weeks, Waka Flocka Flame, Asian Da Brat and BlocBoy JB have come out in support of the president.
Newsweek reached out to the Trump re-election campaign for comment.
Trump unveiled his Platinum Plan in September during an event in Atlanta, Georgia. His Platinum Plan promises to create 3 million new jobs for Black Americans and 500,000 new Black-owned businesses. If the plan is enacted, Juneteenth would be declared a national holiday and lynching would be labeled a national hate crime.
Cube has authored the Contract with Black America (CWBA) which shares some points with the Platinum Plan. In October, Cube said that Democrats had been ""cordial"" to him when discussing the CWBA, but indicated they wanted to wait until after the November election to examine it further.
In an October video posted to Twitter, Cube said that after meeting with Republicans, ""they moved their agenda a lot because of what we said. They put $500 billion on the table, but who knows what's gonna really happen?""
Trump has often touted his administration's support for Black communities. During the September announcement of the Platinum Plan, Trump said that Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden should not be asking Black voters for support, but rather ""begging for their forgiveness.""
In response, Biden's campaign said the Trump administration has been ""devastating for Black Americans.""
""Trump lied about the danger of COVID-19 and failed to contain the virus and tens of thousands of Black Americans have lost their lives,"" the campaign added.

Shannon Bream, ""FOX NEWS @ NIGHT"" team, take it all from here. Shannon.
SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: You can't sneak up on us like that. Laura. I mean, we would have had our goggles ready too. I ordered pair; it would be dazzling on them. Thank you, Laura.
INGRAHAM: See you.
BREAM: OK. Tonight, 11:00 p.m. on the East Coast, 8:00 p.m. on the West Coast, and as night falls out West, we are monitoring the federal courthouse in Portland for signs of trouble tonight, as the Oregon governor says teams of federal officers are set to begin moving out to be replaced by state police.
Is that actually true and would it end the nightly riots that have lasted for more than two months?
Hello and welcome to FOX NEWS @ NIGHT, I'm Shannon Bream in Washington.
Let's get straight to senior correspondent, Rick Leventhal, tracking it all from our West Coast newsroom. Hey, Rick.
RICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Shannon. Perhaps no surprise things got heated again last night and federal agents fully expect more trouble tonight, but it could be their last turn defending the courthouse.
After 62 consecutive nights of confrontation, exchanges of tear gas and projectiles, injuries and arrests outside Portland's federal court building and agreement apparently reached with Oregon State Police stepping into replace the federal tactical teams starting Thursday with hopes it'll put an end to the nightly riot declarations.
The courthouse and surrounding streets are a mess. Crews have been sweeping up, spraying down and painting over waves of graffiti. Local leaders say the turmoil is a direct result of heavy-handed federal tactics. The Feds say they're simply protecting taxpayer property.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CHAD WOLF, ACTING HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: We need state or local law enforcement to step up and help us police the streets and the other areas around that courthouse and to hold individuals accountable.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: As long as there's no trouble on the streets, then everybody should go home.
LEVENTHAL: The U.S. Marshals Special Operations Group and other agents won't stray far, staying in the region in case protesters keep up the attacks and troopers failed to hold the line.
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: So in Portland they have to clean out their city and do their job and get rid of the anarchists and agitators, which is what they are. They're not protestors. They anarchists and agitators.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're not the ones doing the destruction over here. That's outside is that don't even live here that are paid. They're highly financed. They're set up in motels and they're here to do one thing, be a disruptive force.
LEVENTHAL: While the Feds will likely remove the temporary fence surrounding the building and stop sending agents into the streets, while state police make clear a nearby park where protesters and rioters have staged operations with hopes they'll go home now that the Feds withdrawing.
Governor Kate Brown celebrated the deal on Twitter, writing, ""They have acted as an occupying force and brought violence. State police will protect Oregonians right to free speech and keep the peace.""
But the complex may not be over, Shannon. The Trump administration expanding Operation Legend, deploying more Feds to more cities, 25 agents to Cleveland, 40 to Detroit, and 25 to Milwaukee to help local law enforcement battle gangs, guns, and drugs.
So more questions tonight whether protesters in Portland will stand down for the troopers and whether activists and other cities will step up against a new wave of agents on the streets. Shannon?
BREAM: We will be tracking all of it each night here on FOX NEWS @ NIGHT. Rick, thank you.
LEVENTHAL: Sure.
BREAM: New security footage tonight of that New York City protester whose arrest by plainclothes officers in an unmarked van sparks such outrage.
Well, police say the arrest was all about this. Check out the CCTV video from June 30th, showing 18-year-old Nikki Stone splashing a camera with paint from a bucket apparently, then holding a can of spray paint then vandalizing the camera with a broom. Stone and is facing charges in five separate incidents.
In this summer of chaos on the streets, in many of our cities, there are new reports of tragedy striking, sometimes with political overtones.
Correspondent Alex Hogan has the very latest on that tonight. Good evening, Alex.
ALEX HOGAN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Shannon. It is another night of demonstrations with calls for an end to systemic racism and police brutality, protests that we've seen now for eight weeks.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
HOGAN: Amid the Portland protests, violent altercations with federal agents, as well as among activists, police charging Blake Hampe with felony assault and unlawful use of a weapon for allegedly stabbing a man at a Portland Black Lives Matter protest early Saturday morning.
The victim, videographer, Drew Duncomb, who goes by Black Rebel online and self identifies as a Trump supporter tweeting, ""I got stabbed in Portland by ANTIFA on my way to hospital.""
Violence also spreading past protest lines. In Milwaukee, Police releasing surveillance pictures of the suspect wanted in connection with a murder of a 60-year-old last week, asking the public to help identify him.
Bernell Trammell was shot and killed outside his office on Thursday. Friends calling the homicide politically charged, saying, he was well known for supporting the Black Lives Matter movement and the re-election of President Trump.
JANETTE ISLAND, KNEW BERNELL TRAMMELL: He was a really great guy. He means, no --
ADEBISI AGORO, MILWAUKEE PRESIDENT: I respected him just because he had a position. He got his opinion on why he feel that way. I'm not going to knock them.
HOGAN: And in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, the man who allegedly crashed his car into a motorcyclist on purpose, was charged with first-degree homicide, use of a dangerous weapon, and a hate crime.
Police say Daniel Navarro swerved his truck into Philip Thiessen's motorcycle on July 3rd. Navarro telling investigators he suffered racial abuse and that he believed all people who ride Harley Davidsons are typically white racists.
RYAN WALDSCHMIDT, SHERIFF, FOND DU LAC COUNTY: Navarro said that if President Donald Trump and white people are going to create the world we are living in, he has no choice and that people are going to have to die.
HOGAN: Thiessen was a former Marine and police officer.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
HOGAN: Navarro waved his preliminary hearing on July 17th. He is due to be back in court on August 12th to be arraigned. Shannon?
BREAM: All right. Alex Hogan in New York for us tonight, thank you.
So as preparations continue in Milwaukee for next month's Democratic National Convention, more than 100 law enforcement agencies have informed the city, they're withdrawing from agreements to send personnel to assist with convention security.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BOB BAUMAN, ALDERMAN, MILWAUKEE: These other police forces claiming, well, we're not going to participate unless there's adequate, what's adequate? So again, I think it's politics mostly that's being played in support of law enforcement, in general, and then Chief Morales, in particular.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BREAM: We're joined now by the police chief of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, William Lamb to respond to claims that the move is political. Chief, good to have you with us.
WILLIAM LAMB, POLICE CHIEF, FOND DU LAC, WISCONSIN: Thank you. Pleasure to be with you.
BREAM: OK. So what is your sense here? Because what we've heard from a number of these agencies is that they are worried about sending their personnel there when they're told they can't use tear gas or pepper spray or other things they may generally in the past had been able to use to control crowds. Is that the main issue as you understand it?
LAMB: Yes, that's absolutely the main issue. We had concerns leading up to this, going back into June, that there might be shortages of some of the supplies that we would need for crowd control but also that overly restrictive policies might be enacted.
And last week, the Milwaukee fire police commission validated our concerns when they issued a mandate to Chief Morales of the Milwaukee Police Department, instructing him to change department policy to discontinue the use of the chemical irritants or pepper spray in those types of situations. So that was the stepping off-point for myself and a lot of other chiefs.
BREAM: What do you say to people who look at these incursions that are happening with protesters in various cities? Now the peaceful ones, the ones who are taking the next step, inciting violence, destroying property, that kind of thing, and say that it's the use of chemical irritants and those kinds of things that provoke them. And it's not something that law enforcement officers should be using on the streets. How do you respond?
LAMB: Well, I would say that anybody who asserts that law enforcement's use of chemical irritants is what actually incites violence or destruction. Hasn't spent a lot of time studying those situations. As the lead into your broadcast tonight talked about, these are horrific, dynamic, dangerous situations.
And law enforcement does a really remarkable job of responding improperly, and using those chemical munitions or chemical irritants pepper spray, whatever you want to call them, only when they're legally justifiable, and when there are no other alternatives that might work. It's a middle ground and if you take that away...
BREAM: Yes. I mean, we know that your officers go through incredible training, very in depth on these kinds of issues, and I'm guessing it's not something they want to have to engage with protesters and with these particular kinds of weapons.
I want to play something that Senator John Kennedy, Republican from Louisiana said on this show last night.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA): I have no doubt that our local law enforcement officials could safely protect every one of us if the mayors of these cities will allow them, but they're not allowing them.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BREAM: So, Chief, what is the situation where you are? What do you hear from your other law enforcement peers about this? Because, listen, you know, Senator Kennedy is saying what most people think local police are completely up to protecting their own cities, that's what they train for. You're part of the community. It's what you do. Here. His assessment, though, is there are some local leaders that won't let some local police do that.
LAMB: Yes, that's the widely held consensus of law enforcement leaders across the country. Some areas seem to be better than others, some areas worse than others.
Here, unfortunately, in the state of Wisconsin, as I said, in Milwaukee Fire and Police Commission issued a mandate to Chief Morales to discontinue use of the chemical irritants.
And again, that's been the stepping off point for myself and a lot of other chiefs to say that they -- with the rules that they are -- that they have imposed, they are compromising the safety of everybody that's going to be involved.
Everybody attending the DNC, people that might be in that area, law enforcement officers, and frankly, they're setting the law enforcement officers up for failure, and that's unconscionable.
BREAM: Well, Chief Lamb, our thanks to you, your men and women who are out there on the frontlines every day. We know the vast majority of law enforcement folks in this country are good, brave, courageous people who do this, because they do want to serve their communities and we thank you for that, sir.
LAMB: Thank you for that.
BREAM: Well, the president doubling down tonight on how he feels about hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: We're doing very well on vaccine and very well on therapeutics, so that's very important. But I happen to be a believer in hydroxy, I've used it, I had no problems. I happen to be a believer. Many, many people agree with me.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BREAM: Well, Fox News medical contributor Dr. Marc Siegel is digging through the data and he's here tonight with his diagnosis of hydroxychloroquine. Good evening, Doctor.
DR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Good evening, Shannon. As of today, the President is still sticking by hydroxychloroquine. But what is the actual science show?
Over the last several weeks, at least four major studies have come out on the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19, but they have not all reached the same conclusions.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
First, a study from Mount Sinai in New York looked at close to 6,500 patients in retrospect, and found that hydroxychloroquine use was associated with a lower death rate among hospitalized patients. This was published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine.
Then another retrospective study from the Henry Ford Health Systems in Detroit, published in the International Journal for Infectious Diseases, looked at over 2,500 patients with an average hospitalization time of six days, and again found that there was a significant reduction in death among patients who were given hydroxychloroquine.
Just when it seemed that science might really back the drug, two new studies came out in mid-July randomized trials that sometimes drive scientific conclusions. Scientists like to call them the gold standard.
A study from Brazil examined over 500 patients with mild to moderate COVID and found that the group that received hydroxychloroquine did not fare better than those who did it. Critics still said that the drug was given too late. An average of seven days after symptom onset indeed, three other randomized controlled studies which was stopped for the drug providing no benefit were also criticized for the drug being given too late after the patient became ill.
But around the same time, a double blinded internet-based placebo- controlled study from the University of Minnesota, looking at close to 500 outpatients, fail to show a significant benefit to hydroxychloroquine use. The study had flaws relying on self-reporting and lack of diagnostic testing for all patients, but the study was definitely another nail in the drug's coffin.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
SIEGEL: Advocates are still hopeful, but the final answer about the early and preventative use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 isn't in yet. Earlier studies seemed quite promising. But the latest randomized trials have definitely been stacking against it.
More studies are ongoing. We can only hope, Shannon, that in the end, it is the science which decides. Shannon?
BREAM: All right. Dr. Siegel, thank you for the recap.
Supreme Court Justice, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, underwent a minor non-surgical procedure today at a New York City Hospital, having a revision of a bile duct stent, that was originally placed last August. 87-year-old Ginsburg, the court's oldest justice is said to be resting comfortably and expects to be released from the hospital by the end of the week.
Shark attacks and headlines coast to coast, including a rare one in Maine that was deadly.
All right, check it out. We're going to show you a drone video from a team of scientists in Southern California. Supposedly you can see there a great white shark near a surfer waiting for the waves and other sharks circling around offshore. They're also using these underwater robots to get close ups. Researchers say shark populations are going up even as more people are getting out there in the water.
Well, yet again tonight, the left warning that President Trump could deploy federal forces to prevent a peaceful transfer of power if he loses the election.
Well, Acting Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Mark Morgan, has a lot to say about that, then he's going to join us next.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA): I also asked them to commit that they will not let Trump use these forces in the event he loses the election and doesn't want to leave office peacefully. I want to hear that commitment. I want to hear it in their own words. And if they won't say it, then I want to hear that silence. Because at a time like this, their silence will shout.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BREAM: Massachusetts Senator, Elizabeth Warren, expressing concern that the President might deploy federal forces to prevent a peaceful transfer of power if he loses the upcoming election to Joe Biden.
What are the agencies she wants a commitment from is the Department of Homeland Security? So, let's discuss with the players at DHS, the Acting Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Mark Morgan. Good to have you back on the show.
MARK MORGAN, ACTING COMMISSIONER OF U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION: Thanks for having me.
BREAM: OK. So what do you make of this? We continue to hear, over the last couple of weeks, very specific language. This is a trial run, this is going to be martial law, the President is not going to leave. How do you respond to Senator Elizabeth Warren and others who are making those claims?
MORGAN: Look, Shannon, I've been a law enforcement professional for 30 years, that's pure politics. I'm not going to get into -- it's not even worthy of a response. That's ridiculous and outrageous.
What you're seeing in Portland, it has nothing to do with those comments. We were there in Portland to absolutely address specific situations going on, and that's over 60 days of violence targeted against the federal building of the federal law enforcement officers. That's what that's about. That's just an absurd comment.
BREAM: OK. So, I want to read something from Oregon governor, Kate Brown, her tweet saying this, ""After my discussions with VP Pence and others, the federal government has agreed to withdraw federal officers from Portland. They've acted as an occupying force and brought violence. Starting tomorrow, all Customs and Border Protection and ICE officers will leave downtown Portland.""
Now, there's been some back and forth on what this does doesn't mean what the agreement is or isn't. What can you tell us tonight?
MORGAN: Yes. So it's crystal clear. And the Secretary has been crystal clear about his conversations in what was agreed upon. Your listeners need to know, we're not going anywhere right now.
Look, the state police, the governor has authorized the state police to come in to work with the federal authorities that are there, shoulder by shoulder, side by side to address the ongoing violence and anarchy going on in the city streets of Portland, that's what we should be doing, that's what we've been doing for a long time.
But we're not leaving until we're absolutely sure that the threat against that courthouse and the officers inside are -- is gone. Until then, we are going to remain in Portland.
BREAM: OK. Will it be in the same fashion that it's been on the streets with the fencing around the courthouse? Is anything optically going to change? Because their argument has been that this is instigating violence, that this is upsetting the protesters, that it's inciting and accelerating the situation. So will it look different at this point?
MORGAN: You know, Shannon, first of all, the whole premise, I just get so frustrated that -- think about that. And I know the American people are buying this that the sheer presence of federal law enforcement is what's causing and justifying to try to burn down the building and seriously injure the federal agents that are there, that's outrageous and ridiculous.
But what you are going to see and it makes sense, again, something we've been asking for, as the state police come, we're not patrolling the streets of Portland, that's the local state police responsibility. They're going to come in there, they're going to have a strategy where they are going to go in the streets of Portland and do what they should.
If they do that, we can -- we can reduce our footprint and our posture, that's what we're going to do. So you're going to see a different posture at the courthouse. But again, we are going to remain in the Portland area until we think it's safe.
BREAM: It seems that there are two different groups that are getting drawn into this that don't want to be, which are -- you know, we hear from the peaceful protesters and we hear from different Black Lives Matters leaders and people there in Portland who say, you know, they've hijacked our message. We are not about this violence. We want to draw attention to the deaths of George Floyd and others.
We feel like, you know, that's getting lost in this whole thing. Then you have, you know, agents, law enforcement, state, local, federal, who are drawn into this, but people who seem intent on creating chaos and trouble. That's not part of the original message.
How are your men and women out there doing on the frontlines? I can't imagine what a difficult time it is for them, for their families to know that they're walking into this every night.
MORGAN: Shannon, that's exactly right. You just described it very well, that the tragic irony here is a very legitimate message has been hijacked by these criminals and these anarchists. You know, I've been trying to tell the protesters there, the peaceful ones, the lawful ones, hey, go block over. Get your message out, but don't be there because you're actually providing cover for these anarchists.
And I got to tell you, the men and women of law enforcement, it is tough, but they're getting up every day and they're doing the job, the job we're asking them to do to restore law and order and protect that federal building and each other. They're proud to do that, Shannon.
BREAM: We're thankful. We are.
OK. One more thing. Ron Wyden, who's democratic senator there as well, he also doesn't think you're leaving, you say you're not until things change, but this is his take.
""I'm especially concerned there's no specific timeline for full withdrawal of Bill Barr and Donald Trump's minions, his words, that's a loophole big enough to drive an armored personnel carrier through. Bottom line, this occupation should never have happened.""
I'll give you the final word there tonight, sir.
MORGAN: I agree the -- you know, we didn't, first of all, disregard the premise of his occupation. I think you know how I feel about that. But the federal resources didn't need to go there. If two months ago, the local police and state police would have done their job to quell the violence right from the get go, that didn't happen, that's what's caused this.
And now, they're going to work together shoulder to shoulder as we should have at the beginning to absolutely address this anarchy and violence, and I think you're going to see a market difference when we do what we're supposed to as law enforcement agency, Shannon.
BREAM: All right. Well, we are watching closely tonight and every night beyond until things change for the better in Portland.
Acting CBP Commissioner, Mark Morgan, always good to see you. Thank you.
MORGAN: Thank you.
BREAM: Well, Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Apple grilled on Capitol Hill today over accusations they're targeting conservatives. We'll debate it, next.
BREAM: Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Apple's Tim Cook defending their companies today against lawmakers from both sides of the aisle, during a big hearing on Capitol Hill.
But first, an ironic series of technical glitches threatened the testimony, but once it got started, it was deadly serious.
Correspondent Gillian Turner shows us what happened.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Congressman Jim Jordan got right to the heart of what Republican lawmakers have been wanting to grill these big tech execs about for two years.
REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): Big techs out to get Conservatives. That's not a suspicion. That's not a hunch. That's a fact.
TURNER: Jordan put Google's Sundar Pichai directly on the firing line.
JORDAN: Is Google going to tailor its features to help Joe Biden.
SUNDAR PICHAI, CEO, ALPHABET: You have my commitment. It's always been true and we'll continue to conduct ourselves in a neutral way.
TURNER: Other lawmakers quickly lasered in on Zuckerberg.
MARK ZUCKERBERG, FOUNDER, FACEBOOK: Thank you for the opportunity to testify.
TURNER: Who pushed back hard on accusations that Facebook has censored Republicans.
ZUCKERBERG: Our goal is to offer a platform for all ideas.
TURNER: But asked about Twitter censorship of Donald Trump Jr. this week for posting a video advocating hydroxychloroquine to cure COVID-19, Zuckerberg hedged.
ZUCKERBERG: We do not want to become the arbiters of truth. I think that, that would be a bad position for us to be in and not, not what we should be doing.
TURNER: Democrats had a different axe to grind anti-competitiveness. Chairman David Cicilline accusing all four companies of becoming so big, they're killing the tech industry.
REP. DAVID CICILLINE (D-RI): Open markets are predicated on the idea that if a company harms people, consumers, workers and business partners will choose another option. We're here today because that choice is no longer possible.
TURNER: Apple's Tim Cook made the case his company doesn't dominate the market.
TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE: We have fierce competition at the developer side, and the customer side, which is a, which is essentially it's so competitive, I would describe it as a street fight for market share in the smartphone business.
TURNER: Wildcard Jeff Bezos, who had never faced off against lawmakers during his 25-year reign at Amazon until today, tried to stay out of the fray but got in hot water anyway.
REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D-WA): Did Amazon ever access and use third party seller data, when making business decisions?
JEFF BEZOS, CEO, AMAZON: We have a policy against using seller-specific data to aid our private labeled business. But I can't guarantee you that that policy has never been violated.
TURNER: Murphy's Law was in full effect at this hearing today. It had tech problems from beginning to end with lawmakers starting about an hour late and then taking breaks so that those problems could get fixed. One source here on Capitol Hill tells us: it's about par for the course these days. Shannon.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
BREAM: No one is immune. All right. Jillian Turner, thank you. So, between the big tech today and the Attorney General on the hill yesterday, it's been a high-profile week of heated hearings on Capitol Hill. Democrats use the opportunity to take aim at the Attorney General.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. MADELEINE DEAN (D-PA): He was disrespectful. Spoke over top of every one of us. In particular, he spoke over women. He was flanked by at least 10 staffers, not a person of color among them.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BREAM: So, let's debate the mood on Capitol Hill with Fox News Contributor Leslie Marshall, and Author of the brand-new book ""Defender in Chief"", John Yoo. Good to have you both with us.
JOHN YOO, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL: Hi, Shannon.
LESLIE MARSHALL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Hi, Shannon. Good to be here.
BREAM: OK, so John, regardless of which side of the aisle that you're on, if you've watched this thing yesterday and listen, it happens when different groups are in power, different parties are in power. But to continually grill the Attorney General and when he would try to answer a question and say I reclaim my time and not let him answer and then call him rude, John, it seemed like a little bit of a stretch yesterday.
YOO: I thought it was incredible. Look, I've been a staffer on the Senate, on the Judiciary Committee, and helped prepare senators and I've been a witness before congressional committees. I've never seen anything like the performance yesterday. They treated Bill Barr like he was one of the cardboard cutouts in the second rate, Major League Baseball cave we've been watching, he's just a prop.
They were making speeches, campaign commercials, essentially, and they weren't giving Attorney General Barr the chance to answer. Our congressmen and congresswomen should remember that these events are called hearings. They're called hearings for a reason; they are supposed to be hearing and listening to the American people about problems and to be seeing how the executive branches doing its job.
Instead, they did all the talking and I'm afraid, wasted a whole day of Attorney General's time when he has a lot of important things to be doing. There are serious problems, no doubt that they could be asking questions about: the riots in Portland, the intervention of federal law enforcement officers, and so on. Instead, they went ahead and scored, I thought cheap political points, rather than really trying to figure out what the problems are and what possible solutions are.
BREAM: Unless, I mean, there was plenty of coverage, and there are those on different points of the ideological spectrum who think the Democrats didn't do themselves a ton of favors yesterday with this hearing, because it did look very combative and unserious. Do you think that's a legitimate point?
MARSHALL: Yes, I do. I'm a Democrat, I felt they were clearly out for blood. And, you know, look, whether it's left or right, I would agree with John in the sense that if you're going to ask a question, you need to hear, out of hearing the answer. But here's the problem further with these televised hearings, we see it on reality shows all the time.
People play for the cameras, and we see that both from Republicans, you know, and Democrats and I think sometimes they lose sight. What Democrats were accusing the Attorney General of was not being the attorney general, the lawyer for the United States, but rather being biased and being the President's, if you will, personal lawyer.
And I think there were two times he alluded to that, and they should have pushed back more and I were, personally, would have liked to have heard more answers regarding to issues of voter fraud by mail, which he had no evidence of his comments for. And in addition, for COVID-19, and some of the failings not only of the federal government, but of the various states.
BREAM: Well, and for this issue about mail-in ballots, I mean, there are a number of cases that have been, you know, flagged in recent headlines, and not least of which is the fact that in New York, not necessarily fraud, but that a bunch of ballots that are still missing weeks after the election there, the primary election there. So, I know there are questions on that point, but I want to ask you quickly both about the president tweeting this about the big tech today saying: ""If Congress doesn't bring fairness to big tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with executive orders. In Washington, it's been all talk and no action for years and the people of our country are sick and tired of it."" Before we run out of time, I want to get a quick comment from you both. John, can you do that?
YOO: Well, gosh, I think anti-trust is really boring, frankly. But I think there is a much more important, they should stick can the government regulate these very large companies, which are private companies, so they don't have to follow the free speech clause of the Constitution? Can the government intervene and force them to give free rights of speech to everyone? I'm not sure they can, and I don't know if they can do it under the guise of Anti-Trust Law.
BREAM: Yes, and some will say it's become a bit of a public forum, and the government may have an interest in getting involved there.
MARSHALL: Yes, definitely. It's funny, John, said that, because I was going to say, look, Congress needs to rethink Anti-Trust Laws, period, whether you have these hearings or not. This is an area where you have bipartisan agreement. Additionally, I think we have not just national but international agreement when it comes to protecting our children for the child sex abuse exploitation that we see out there on the Internet.
But even more so, Shannon, right now, the American people I think, are really sick of hearings, whether it's the Attorney General, or these tech giants, because what Americans really care about is COVID, are they going to be able to feed themselves with a July 31st fast approaching. And in addition to that, you know, the, the, the racial injustice, the riots, the protest, that's what on America -- that's what's on America's minds, not Google, not Amazon, not Facebook, and not Bill Barr.
BREAM: All right, Leslie, we're going to talk about that coming up with a special guest. Thank you both very much, Leslie and John, good to see you.
YOO: Thank you, Shannon.
MARSHALL: Thank you, Shannon.
BREAM: All right. Congressman Louie Gohmert says he's going to isolate for 10 days after testing positive for COVID-19. The Republican from Texas is disputing reports that he's not been wearing a mask for most of his time on the Capitol Hill, but he says he still believes in personal freedom concerning face coverings. Attorney General Bill Barr, who was in contact with Gohmert yesterday tested negative for the virus tonight.
And in a quick COVID update from overseas, the Dutch government deciding it will not advise the public to wear masks, saying their effectiveness has not been proven through. But you can see here a walk-through Amsterdam yesterday, revealing a lot of people who are wearing masks.
So, there's an uptick in cases in Europe as well as here but Sweden for example, which never closed businesses or primary schools all the way says it's still seeing a decline in its cases.
Another show of defiance amid COVID restrictions, this time in northern Minnesota. Thousands showed up as for what's known as Minnesota's largest outdoor rodeo, packing the stands for the three-day events despite orders to limit crowds because of the coronavirus pandemic.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I feel safe going anywhere and I'll, I'll do that at my own risk.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We all live this same lifestyle and we all have each other's backs. And we all are adults, we can pull up our big boy pants and know that if we're sick, we don't go out.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BREAM: Most of the attendees did not appear to be wearing masks.
All right, late breaking news tonight, the NBA rocked by yet another human rights scandal in China. Florida Senator Marco Rubio weighs in right here, next.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PALMER LUCKEY, FORMER EXECUTIVE, FACEBOOK: A lot of people in Silicon Valley don't really understand this. A lot of people in Silicon Valley, a lot of companies in Silicon Valley see China as the ultimate business opportunity, not the ultimate adversary, and that is a huge problem. Think about if in World War II, if the biggest companies in the United States with the best technology had believed that Imperial Japan or Nazi Germany were better long-term business prospects in their own country. Do you think that we would have won? Would we have built the tech that we did? No, of course not.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BREAM: Former Facebook Executive Palmer Luckey, echoing Attorney General Bill Barr and characterizing American businesses cozying up to China, akin to being unpatriotic even dangerous. Meanwhile, tonight, the NBA's China problem is back again. According to an investigation by ESPN, the league's youth development academies in its largest international market, China, now stand accused of physical abuse and a lack of schooling for the program's young participants. Talk about all the new revelations what's going on in China and more with acting Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman, Republican from Florida Senator Marco Rubio. Welcome back to FOX NEWS AT NIGHT.
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL): Thanks for having me back.
BREAM: OK, so let's start with some of these NBA allegations. Former NBA coach is quoted in this investigation as saying we were basically working for the Chinese government. The investigation outlines all kinds of abuse, lack of schooling, other things regarding young players. What is the situation with the NBA with China? What do you think it shouldn't be?
RUBIO: Well, first of all, it's troubling. Look, the National China has a billion people. It's a massive market, basketball is very popular. And if you're the NBA, you're thinking to yourself, we have a chance to sell our product in the biggest market in the world and they see dollar figures and they're looking to expand and grow.
The problem is, this is not just any other market. This is the totalitarian government that doesn't have any of the same concepts of freedom of speech or human rights that we have in the United States, or many parts of the world, and you got to play by the rules. So, when you go to China, number one, you are a part of the Chinese government, there's no other way around it because even their companies have people on their boards and inside of their offices that are from the Communist Party.
They are all ultimate -- you're only in business in China, they allow you to be in business. And by allow you to be in business, it means you have to play by their rules and serves their purposes. And so, the NBA is in the same place as a lot of large corporations are when they go into China. They have to look the other way on some pretty atrocious actions on the part of the Chinese Communist Party.
BREAM: Yes, and the allegations that we're hearing in recent weeks. I mean, we've been hearing -- oppression of a religious minority, they're like millions of people. This is something more that we're hearing now, activist pushing for an investigation to claims that China is forcibly harvesting organs of the Uighurs.
The quote from Foxnews.com says this: ""Two Uighur activist organizations filed a complaint to the International Criminal Court against the Beijing leadership, alleging that the top brass had committed genocide and crimes against humanity against the Uighurs, including the stealing of organs from the mostly Muslim-Turkic ethnic group.""
I got to say, most Americans, if they believed that that was a reality, if they knew that it was a reality, would want nothing to do with being involved American companies, American interests with China, but do we have a voice in calling out the human rights abuses by staying engaged? Should we disengage? I mean, that's a horrific allegation.
RUBIO: Well, first of all, let me just say it is a horrific allegation. I'm not here to tell you, but no one's been a bigger opponent of what they do than I do. I've heard that allegation before. I don't have evidence of it. Obviously, there is evidence of it the world deserves to know. But what we already know for sure is they are, they detain people, they put them in camps, they try to strip them of their identity, they force them to change their name, renounce their faith and religion, all sorts of terrible things, and forced labor.
They forced them to work. And we know that there are Western companies that have benefited from that. Your fundamental question is, do we disengage from China? Look, they are the second largest economy in the world, the most populous nation on Earth, they're a nuclear power, they're going to continue to grow in power and influence. We have to have a relationship with them, but it has to be a balanced relationship, meaning we can't continue to allow them to cheat, steal our jobs and, and create unfair advantages over us.
And it also has to be one that doesn't require us to abandon our fundamental print, in essence that requires us to look the other way when they do these horrible things, or when they crack down on free speech, or when they break the rules when it comes to the commitments that made on Hong Kong. The price of that balance and of engagement cannot be that we abandon our principles, our ideals, and most importantly, our national interests.
BREAM: Yes, because I don't think that there's a bigger megaphone to draw attention to that than the American megaphone. I want to ask you about something else what we have you, the negotiations going on, on the Hill about coming up together with another relief package as key elements of the current coronavirus package are set to expire. This is what Senate Minority Leader, the top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, said today about Republicans in these negotiations.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): They put us up against the wall we have to cliffs because they wouldn't negotiate for months. The heroes bill passed 10 weeks ago today. I've been -- we've been asking Leader McConnell to negotiate for a month and now they're up against the wall.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BREAM: OK, so where are we tonight, Senator?
RUBIO: Well, a couple points. I mean, we have to do something for the economy writ large. We know that I don't like spending a trillion dollars or whatever it ends up being. But I think the alternative is even worse, which is structural deep damage to our economy that could take a decade or more to recover from, and millions of people losing their jobs, so we have to do something.
Passing something means you have to have a Republican Senate passed something with support from Democrats, we need 60 votes. A Democratic House passed something and a Republican president, President Trump sign it. So, it's going to have to be a product of that dirty word called compromise, but we're going to have to do something. And now, it's not going to be the Heroes Act.
I mean, that bill has all kinds of things in it that has absolutely nothing to do with the pandemic. But it does have to be something that helps people that are looking for jobs and can't find one right now, help small businesses survive, help protect companies from being sued out of existence, help develop more testing capability and, and hopefully ultimately vaccine and helps with the exhort extraordinary cost of going back to school that will be associated with making those schools safe.
We have to do all of that. And we got to get it done soon. And I hope we can make some progress and stop playing this sort of political game back and forth and finger pointing, which you know has become far too common hear from my, my friends as we call them on the other side of the aisle, the Democrat.
BREAM: Well, it sounds like there are a lot of threads there potentially that everybody could agree together on and get together on. We'll watch as those deadlines are taking in. Senator Marco Rubio, thanks for your time.
RUBIO: Thank you.
BREAM: The President vows he will never let anyone put American energy out of business, details when we return.
BREAM: The President is making an election year push to enhance U.S. energy independence. Correspondent Rich Edson joins us with more. Hey, Rich.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Shannon. President Trump's swung through Texas this afternoon picking up millions for his reelection campaign, knocking his presumed opponent the former Vice President Joe Biden, and touting his administration's record on energy. The President toward the double Eagle energy oil rig in Midland. This year, lower prices have battered the oil industry and the President is campaigning on supporting the sector.
TRUMP: Well, my administration is fighting for workers like you, the radical left is fighting to abolish American energy to destroy the oil and gas industries and wipe out your jobs.
EDSON: In Libya, Russian-linked military contractors have seized control of two of Libya's largest oil facilities. Libya has been in a civil war for the better part of a decade. A State Department spokesperson says Libya should reject attempts to militarize the energy sector.
Two weeks ago, the Treasury Department sanctioned a Russian businessman. Officials say, they believe is behind the Russian-backed militia operating in Libya. A bipartisan congressional report is also focusing on wealthy Russians. The Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations says Russian oligarchs are using the art industry to evade American sanctions.
The report says intermediaries bought more than $18 million of art through shell companies linked to Russian oligarchs, the same Russians the US sanctions in 2014. The report says quote: ""The subcommittee's investigation uncovered a complex set of facts involving shell companies with hidden owners, intermediaries who mask purchasers and sellers and lacks money laundering safeguards in the U.S. art industry. Senators Rob Portman and Tom Carper say they're pushing for stronger standards to police transactions in the art industry. Shannon.

Anyone, Sikh or not, can visit a gurdwara and partake in langar, with the biggest ones — like the Golden Temple in Amritsar, India — serving more than 100,000 people every day.
Since the coronavirus pandemic has halted religious gatherings in most of the country, including langar, gurdwaras like the Sikh Center of New York, in Queens Village, are mobilizing their large-scale cooking resources to meet the skyrocketing need for food aid outside their places of worship.
Some are feeding the protesters marching in outrage over the killings of George Floyd and other black Americans by the police. Last week, a dozen or so volunteers from the Queens center served 500 portions of matar paneer, rice and rajma, a creamy, comforting dish of red beans stewed with tomatoes, and 1,000 bottles of water and cans of soda to demonstrators in Sunnyside. They also offered dessert: kheer, a sweetened rice pudding.
“Where we see peaceful protest, we are going,” said Himmat Singh, a coordinator at the World Sikh Parliament, an advocacy group providing volunteers for the Queens Village efforts. “We are looking for justice. We support this.”
Since the pandemic began, soup kitchens have had difficulty keeping up with demand. Shuttered schools and even fine-dining restaurants are using their kitchens to prepare and serve hot meals. But few other places are as well positioned to handle the sheer scale of assistance required right now as the gurdwaras. Most have large, well-equipped kitchens, a steady stream of volunteers and no shortage of ingredients, thanks to regular donations from community members.
During the last annual Sikh Day Parade in New York, in April 2019, the Queens Village kitchen — which has a walk-in cooler, multiple freezers, 50-liter stockpots and a huge grill that can cook dozens of rotis at once — produced 15,000 meals in a single day.
The Sikhs’ biggest challenge isn’t keeping up with demand. It’s letting people know that they’re here — without making a big show of it or proselytizing, which is forbidden.
Founded in the 15th century in Punjab, India, by the spiritual leader Guru Nanak, Sikhism has an estimated 500,000 followers in the United States and 280 gurdwaras, according to the Sikh Coalition, a civil-rights organization in New York City. One of the most visibly distinctive features of the Sikh practice is the turban — a symbol of the religion’s belief in equality — though not everyone chooses to wear one.
Sikhs in America have been often been prey to bigotry, hate crimes and Islamophobia, particularly since 9/11. A few volunteers said in interviews that before going out to distribute meals, they worried that they might hear ignorant comments. But Santokh Dillon, the president of the Guru Nanak Mission Society of Atlanta, said the people he serves are often more puzzled than prejudiced. Most have never even heard of Sikhism, he said.
When some find out that the meals are free, “They look at us and say, ‘You are kidding, right?’ ”
At least 80 gurdwaras in the United States are now providing food assistance. For many, the transition has been quick and seamless.
This is not just because the infrastructure is already there, said Satjeet Kaur, the executive director of the Sikh Coalition. “The call to action and the responsibility” for helping others is deeply entrenched in the Sikh way of life. Sikhs are expected to donate at least 10 percent of their time or income toward community service.
It took the Gurdwara Sahib of Fremont, Calif., just a few days after suspending religious services in March to set up a meal and grocery delivery program, and a drive-through meal pickup system outside the gurdwara.
Cooks wear gloves and masks, and the kitchen is big enough for workers to stand more than six feet from one another. As at most gurdwaras, the menu changes regularly, but is typically Indian and always vegetarian. (Meat is not permitted in gurdwaras.)
While these Sikh volunteers, known as sevadars, are experts in mass-meal preparation, they aren’t as accustomed to spreading the word. The Fremont kitchen has produced 15,000 to 20,000 meals a day on holidays like New Year’s Eve, said Dr. Pritpal Singh, a member of the gurdwara. But now, the gurdwara is serving just 100 to 150 people each day.
Dr. Singh said he hoped that more people in need would come pick up food. “We could do hundreds of thousands of meals if given the task,” he said.
But with the demonstrations unfolding around the country, Sikhs aren’t waiting for people to come to them any longer. On Tuesday, volunteers from the Gurdwara Sahib attended a protest in Fremont and handed out several hundred bottles of water as a show of solidarity.
On a recent Friday, Gurjiv Kaur and Kiren Singh asked the volunteers at their gurdwara, the Khalsa Care Foundation, in the Pacoima neighborhood of Los Angeles, to prepare meals in the community kitchen that they could take to the protest. The next morning, they and others picked up about 700 containers of pasta with a garlic- and onion-laden tomato sauce and 500 bottles of water from the gurdwara, and set up a tent in Pan Pacific Park. Soon, protesters started arriving at the tent with other donations, like medical supplies, snacks and hand sanitizer.
“It is our duty to stand up with others to fight for justice,” said Ms. Kaur, a graduating senior at the University of California, Irvine. “Langar at its core is a revolution — against inequality and the caste system,” the antiquated hereditary class structure in South Asia, which Sikhism has always rejected.
In Norwich, Conn., volunteers from five gurdwaras handed out a few hundred bottles of water to protesters last Tuesday, and on Friday, distributed as many containers of rajma, or kidney beans, and rice on a Main Street sidewalk, a block from City Hall.
Swaranjit Singh Khalsa, a volunteer and a member of the Norwich Board of Education, noted that historically, many Sikhs in India have been killed by the police while fighting for their civil rights.
At many gurdwaras in the United States, most of those who show up for langar meals are Sikhs. Now that they are catering to a broader population, menus have changed to suit different tastes. In the Seattle area, volunteers at the Gurudwara Sacha Marag Sahib are making pasta and tacos in addition to rice and dal.
At the Hacienda de Guru Ram Das in Española, N.M., meals have included enchiladas and burritos. Still, Harimandir Khalsa, a volunteer, said the community kitchen is operating at less than 10 percent of its capacity.
“I think it is about convenience,” Mr. Khalsa said, as the gurdwara isn’t centrally located. “If we had a food truck parked in front of Walmart that said, ‘Free food,’ we could get more takers. But for people to get in their cars and drive over to this place — people aren’t that desperate yet.”
Location is also an issue for the Guru Ramdas Gurdwara Sahib in Vancouver, Wash., as the neighborhood doesn’t have much foot traffic, said Mohan Grewal, the gurdwara secretary. So every other Sunday, volunteers pack up 300 to 400 meals made in the gurdwara and drive them to the Living Hope Church, a Christian congregation six miles away, in a more urban part of the city.
One of the biggest challenges for gurdwaras is that many hospitals, shelters and other charitable organizations they’d like to help don’t take cooked food because of hygienic concerns, or accept it only if it meets certain health codes. Many Sikhs have started collecting and distributing pantry items in addition to making meals.
Still, some gurdwaras are bustling. In Riverside, Calif., a hub for the Sikh population, volunteers from the United Sikh Mission, an American nonprofit aid group, and the Khalsa School Riverside, a children’s program, serve 3,000 to 5,000 meals every day at the Riverside Gurdwara. People line up in the drive-through as early as 9:30 a.m., even though it doesn’t open until 11:30.
The process is highly systematized. The cooking team shows up at 5:30 a.m. to prepare meals based on previous days’ numbers, as well as requests from senior centers, hospitals and nursing homes; another team packs the meals into microwave-safe boxes; and the third distributes them at the drive-through and other locations. The gurdwara shares information about the free meals through regular posts on large Facebook groups for local residents.
“We didn’t just sit there and say we are going to cook and wait for people to come,” said Gurpreet Singh, a volunteer for the United Sikh Mission.
Since the protests, Mr. Singh and others have been reaching out to black organizations, like churches, offering to drop off meals or groceries. They expect to see an increase in people showing up for meals, as thousands have been attending protests in the area.
Groups like United Sikhs, an international nonprofit, are helping to get the word out. They have stepped up efforts to identify areas of need, connect gurdwaras with organizations seeking assistance, provide best practices for food preparation during the pandemic and mobilize Sikhs to help feed protesters.
While the pandemic continues, a few gurdwaras aren’t using their kitchens. Tejkiran Singh, a spokesman for the Singh Sabha of Michigan, west of Detroit, said the gurdwara committee decided it was too risky to start a meal distribution service, especially since Michigan has become a hot spot for the coronavirus.
When the Sikh Society of Central Florida, in Oviedo, reopens on June 14, services will be limited to fewer people, and food will be handed out in to-go containers as they leave.
But Amit Pal Singh and Charanjit Singh, the chairman and the treasurer of the Sikh Society of Central Florida, also want to continue the drive-through and delivery services they developed during the pandemic.
“The concept of langar is to serve the needy,” Mr. Pal Singh said. Before the pandemic, he said, most people participating in langar were local Sikhs coming more for social and religious reasons than out of need. The drive-through and deliveries will allow them to put meals into the hands of people who struggle to afford to eat.
That will mean a lot of extra food for volunteers to prepare, in a city where the Sikh population is still small. But none of that seemed to worry Mr. Pal Singh.
“We would love to be in that situation,” he said, his optimism vibrating through the phone. “We will handle it.”

The IncludedT Committee announced that the motto of the XLII edition of the March of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Travesty, and Intersex (LGBTTTI+) is Alert, for our rights Not to rollback!.
They also announced that this 2020, like the years of aneriores, the aim is to give voice to the human rights of the community that integrates sexual diversity, as well as to raise awareness and applaud activists who fight for better living conditions for the community.
2020 will see the 42th edition of the LGBTTTI+ Pride March and the first to be held virtually. The first physically held was held on July 26, 1978, headed by the Homosexual Revolutionary Action Front (FHAR) and the Lambda Gay Liberation Group.

The committee also reported that virtual activities ""will be accompanied by recognized personalities committed to the cause, representations of LGBTTTI+ pride march organizing committees in other states of the republic, civil society organizations and, of course, musical talent.""
Among the demands of the march and the community is: the rights of trans children, national approval of the same rights for all people throughout the country (health, medicine, work, life free from violence and discrimination) and the right to justice for hate crimes.
Transphobia and violence
In Mexico, according to Letra S, a civil organization dedicated to the dissemination of information and the defense of human rights focused on issues of sexual diversity and gender, reported 117 violent deaths of LGBT people in the first year of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.
Causes of death are related to the sexual orientation, identity or gender expression of the victims. Until the first on April 30, there was a record of 26 murders, the highest number in the previous five years, where the average number of LGBT people killed was 88.
In the diversity of the community, trans women or trans women with female expression were the victims violent during 2019 with 64 transfemicides, representing almost 55% of the total records.
As of April 30, there were 26 murders in the LGBTTTI+ community so far from 2020 (Photo: Twitter)
""The distinguishing feature of LGBT killings is the entanglement with which they are committed,"" letra the study by Letra S, clarified.
In the first quarter of the year, the civil organization has recorded 26 murders of LGBTTTI+ people, which represents a lower figure than last year, in the same period where they reported 37 violent deaths, however, AlejandroBrito, director of the organization Letra, points out that ""social estrangement measures are likely to have reduced the number of homicides committed against LGBT people.""
Despite this, Brito cautioned that ""if prevention of such crimes is not planned, I have no doubt that the numbers will be increased again as soon as activities are restored"" and mentioned that one of the main obstacles to preventing violence against LGBT people lies in the lack of official records as state prosecutors do not register the sexual orientation and gender identity of victims.

Everywhere I look, people are treating one another badly, and this should greatly alarm all of us. Perhaps we can blame some of this on the pandemic, because the restrictions that authorities have implemented around the nation have definitely put people in a bad mood. 
And of course the fact that this is an election year is certainly not helping things. But I am seeing people that are supposedly on the same side treating each other with extreme contempt. Conservatives are fighting with conservatives, liberals are fighting with liberals, Christians are fighting with Christians, and over the past year I have been seeing families break up all over the place. Hearts are growing so cold, and all of the strife and discord that we are witnessing makes me wonder what things will be like when economic conditions in this nation really start falling apart. There is so much anger and frustration in the air right now, and we are definitely seeing this being reflected in the crime numbers. For example, it is being reported that burglaries in San Francisco have risen 42 percent[1] so far this year In San Francisco, burglaries are up 42% in the first 9 months of this year, compared to the same time period in 2019. In the Northern District, which includes Pacific Heights, the Marina, North Beach, and Cow Hollow, it's up 59%. In the Mission, 79% and in the Richmond up 50%. In some neighborhoods, the same criminals are returning over and over again, and things have gotten so bad that one local resident recently admitted that she 'cannot sleep at night anymore'[2] Thieves are returning to the same homes and neighborhoods within the same week, sometimes only one day apart. 'It's a big wave of crime right now. it's home burglaries and this is scary. I cannot sleep at night anymore,' said Iryna Gorb. I can't even imagine what it must be like lying in bed wondering if this will be the night when the burglars will return again. In addition to home invasions, San Francisco is seeing an alarming number of stores being hit as well[3] And it's not just happening to homes. Video from a Pacific Heights' Food Market a week and a half ago shows a suspect's seen setting up a blow torch on the store's glass. When it doesn't budge, he comes back and tries a throwing a planter to break in. We are seeing similar scenes play out all over America on a nightly basis these days, and it is only going to get worse in the months ahead. Over on the east coast, New York City has also seen a 42 percent rise in burglaries so far in 2020, and the number of shootings is up 91 percent[4] Year-to-date, there has been a 91% spike in citywide shooting incidents,a 42% increase in burglaries anda 33% decrease in hate crimes. Considering the fact that hundreds of thousands of people[5] have already moved out of New York City, there shouldn't be that many people left to shoot, but these are the numbers that authorities are giving us. And sometimes people are being murdered without a gun being used at all. I have to admit that I was greatly disturbed when I recently heard what happened to one man on a Manhattan subway platform[6] A man has died after he was repeatedly stabbed in the legs following a dispute on a lower Manhattan subway station in New York City on Saturday, officials revealed. The attack unfolded just before 3pm on the northbound J/Z train platform in Chambers Street Station, near to City Hall, where the victim, in his 20s, had been ensnared in an argument with another man, said to be in his 30s. How cold does your heart have to be to attack someone like that? Sadly, acts of extreme violence are happening in our major cities so frequently now that they barely make a blip in the news. In the middle of the country, murders and shootings in Chicago are both up over 50 percent in 2020, and it is being reported[7] that 'dozens of children' under the age of 10 have been shot over the last nine months The Windy City-likeothers across the country[8]-has seen an uptick in violent crimes this summer[9]amid the coronavirus pandemic, mass layoffs and nationwide unrest.Murders and shootings are up 52%[10]from the same time last year, according to police data, anddozens of children under 10years old[11]have been shot,some fatally[12]. This is what America has become. We have become a place where children under the age of 10 are being shot on a regular basis. Most of us depend on the police to protect us from this sort of violence, but they are being shot on a regular basis too. Here is just one examplethat was in the news today[13] A shooting over the weekend left one Myrtle Beach police officer dead and another injured, according to a news release from the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division. The officers were responding to a domestic violence call Saturday night. Authorities say shots were exchanged between them and a suspect after a confrontation. The thin veneer of civilization that we all take for granted on a daily basis is steadily disappearing, and it isn't just happening in the big cities. Some of the worst crimes of all are happening in less populated areas, and if you doubt this just check outthis example[14]. For decades, we have been raising children in an environment in which traditional moral values have been relegated to the fringes of society, and so we should not be surprised that our society is now literally coming apart at the seams all around us. And if you think what we have experienced so far is bad, just wait until we get a few more years down the road[15]. Chaos and violence in our streets has become the norm[16], and our society now teaches us that it is perfectly okay to hate one another. Treating others the way that you want to be treated is such a simple concept, but it works. Unfortunately, most of the population has rejected the simple values that once united our nation, and so our society will continue to fall apart all around us as we plunge into a deeply uncertain future. ***Michael's new book entitled 'Lost Prophecies Of The Future Of America' is now availablein paperback[17]andfor the Kindle[18]onAmazon.com[19].*** https://amzn.to/3nj2f1e About the Author: My name is Michael Snyder and my brand new book entitled'Lost Prophecies Of The Future Of America'[20]is now availableon Amazon.com[21].

61,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_751/Files (250).DOCX","CNN.com",2020-06-14,"1157 words","US","By Lauren Holt, CNN",NA,"Thousands show up for black trans people in nationwide protests",FALSE,"Black transgender activist Raquel Willis stood on the deck of the Brooklyn Museum on Sunday and led thousands of protesters in a chant.
""I believe in my power,"" she said, as people in the crowd echoed the words back. ""I believe in your power. I believe in our power. I believe in black trans power.""
The Black Trans Lives Matter rally in New York, one of many nationwide, came after two black trans women -- Dominique ""Rem'Mie"" Fells, 27, of Philadelphia, and Riah Milton, 25, of Cincinnati, Ohio -- were murdered last week.
There have been 14 reported murders of trans and gender non-conforming people -- including Fells and Milton -- since the start of 2020, according to the Human Rights Campaign. But the number of deaths of trans people are likely undercounted, the Human Rights Campaign said in its report on anti-transgender violence in the US in 2019.
Sunday's protest also took place amid global demonstrations in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, which has surged in the wake of George Floyd's death.
It also followed the Trump administration's announcement that it is eliminating an Obama-era regulation prohibiting discrimination in health care against patients who are transgender.
Led by and centered around black trans women, Sunday's march and rally in New York gave trans and gender non-conforming people the opportunity to mourn lives lost, and to vocalize their demand for justice and fair treatment.
""We can't just talk about trans people when they're dying,"" Eliel Cruz, one of the co-organizers of the event and director of communications at NYC Anti-Violence Project, told CNN. ""But what are we doing actively and intentionally to create space for them to be safe and well?""
Protesters wore white as a nod to black history
Protesters wore white and were asked to march silently for the first portion of Sunday's march.
Rally co-organizer Fran Tirado explained this decision was made as a nod to black history. In 1917, nearly 10,000 demonstrators in New York City wore white as they participated in the NAACP's Silent Protest Parade, one of the first public demonstrations of civil rights by black Americans.
""We felt that was a really powerful way to think about our action in relation to a lot of others and how thinking on the metaphor of like silence equals death and how everything comes together,"" Tirado, a queer writer and producer, told CNN.
""In the 1917 Silent Parade the men wore black while women and children wore white,"" co-organizer West Dakota explained in a statement following the protest. ""The decision to wear white was to symbolize our unity, and also to take a stand against corporate appropriation of the rainbow flag. We don't need rainbow (merchandise) to show our pride.""
The role of organizer in times of civil unrest has most often been filled by the same black and brown people who themselves are facing violence and mistreatment, Tirado said.
It was important to Sunday's organizers -- a group made up primarily of queer people of color, both black and non-black -- that the legwork of organizing be done by non-trans folks, while keeping the spotlight on the partnering trans activists and organizations.
""This collective of folks is particularly powerful because it's modeling what is possible when you do have allies and folks who do care and also want to make sure that they're building something that speaks to the hearts of the actual people that they're representing,"" Willis told CNN in an interview. ""So often that doesn't happen.""
Melania Brown, the sister of Layleen Polanco, was among the speakers at the New York rally on Sunday. Polanco, an AfroLatinx transgender woman, died in June of 2019 while being held in solitary confinement following an epileptic seizure at Riker's Island.
""Black trans lives matter,"" Brown told the crowd. ""My sister's life mattered. All of the loved ones we have lost, all of these beautiful girls that we have lost. There lives matter. We have to protect them.""
Protest partners were all trans-based support organizations
While Sunday's protest came in response to the murders of Fells and Milton, organizers emphasized the necessity to fight for trans lives beyond seeking post-mortem justice.
Like Fells and Milton, the majority of trans people killed are black women. Ninety-one percent of the reported murders of trans and gender non-conforming people in 2019 were black women, and 81% were under the age of 30, according to the Human Rights Campaign, which tracks reported killings.
Violence against the transgender community often goes unreported or misreported, as a result of authorities, media reports, and family members misidentifying the dead, the Human Rights Campaign said.
Deadnaming is the term used to refer to the use of a trans person's birth name in place of their chosen name, as has been the case for Riah Milton, who was deadnamed and misgendered by the Butler County Sheriff's Office in a press conference last Thursday. CNN has reached out to the sheriff's office, which is handling the case, for request for comment.
All of the partners in Sunday's protest are trans-based support organizations that provide both immediate and longterm assistance to trans people, organizers said.
The Okra Project delivers free meals to trans and gender non-conforming individuals who are experiencing food insecurity. Gays and Lesbians Living In a Transgender Society (G.L.I.T.S) facilitates assistance, including health care and housing, for transgender sex workers. The organization is nearing its $1 million fundraising goal following a surge in donations, said Ceyenne Doroshow, G.L.I.T.S founder, on Sunday.
Nationwide solidarity
New York City wasn't the only place where trans activists and allies mobilized.
In Los Angeles on Sunday, an estimated 25,000 people marched through Hollywood during an All Black Lives Matter protest, CNN affiliate KTLA reported. The march was meant to honor Tony McDade, a black transgender man who was shot by a Tallahassee police officer last week.
Protesters carried rainbow flags and balloons, as an aircraft overhead pulled a ""Black Lives Matter"" banner.
""The protest is in direct response to racial injustice, systemic racism, and all forms of oppression,"" the Black LGBTQIA Advisory Board Council, which organized the protest, said on its website.
A group of people in Chicago organized a Drag March for Change this weekend. They demanded justice for victims of police brutality, as well as a reclassification of violence against transgender individuals as hate crimes, CNN affiliate WLS reported.
In Boston, thousands chanted ""no justice, no peace, no anti-trans violence on our streets"" as they marched from Franklin Park to Nubian Square, CNN affiliate WCVB reported.
""We know that black people are vulnerable -- especially vulnerable in this society -- and especially trans folks and trans black folks,"" protester Khery Petersen-Smith told WCVB. ""So I think it's important we all show up and build solidarity."""

Today, U.S Senator Kirsten Gillibrand announced the Senate passage of the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism Act of 2019 (S.238, H.R 221), a bipartisan and bicameral bill that would enhance the State Department’s role in combating and monitoring anti-Semitism across the globe. Gillibrand was joined by Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL) Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Cory Gardner (R-CO), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) as original co-sponsors of the bill.
The bill now heads to the U.S House of Representatives for consideration.
“As we have seen far too often, anti-Semitism is an urgent threat in New York State, our country, and across the world,” said Senator Gillibrand. “We must do everything in our power to confront, and end, this growing danger. I am proud that we were able to pass this bipartisan bill to elevate the position of special envoy to the rank of ambassador in order to ensure that the State Department can monitor and help combat anti-Semitism across the globe. I will always stand with the Jewish community, and fight against hatred and prejudice in all its forms. ”
Gillibrand recently led a bipartisan push to increase funding to help protect nonprofit institutions against terror attacks, calling for up to $360 million for the Nonprofit Security Grant Program. Gillibrand previously secured $90 million in NSGP funding in 2019 and $60 million in NSGP funding in 2018. The funding allocated by this program will support non-profit organizations most at risk of terror attacks through the acquisition and installation of physical target hardening measures, related preparedness and prevention planning, training, and exercises, and contracted security personnel so that religious and community based organizations have the critical resources and tools they need to protect lives and property. According to a recent FBI report on hate crime statistics in 2019, 60.2% were victims of crimes motivated by offenders’ anti-Jewish bias.
The Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism Act will:
Elevate the position of special envoy to monitor and combat anti-Semitism to the rank of ambassador; Direct the special envoy to report directly to the secretary of state; Prohibit the special envoy from being double-hatted with another portfolio of issues; Emphasize that the special envoy should be a person of recognized distinction in the field of combating anti-Semitism or religious freedom; and Clarify that the special envoy shall be the primary advisor and coordinator for U.S government efforts to monitor and combat anti-Semitism and anti-Semitic incitement in foreign countries."

Alaa Massri was among the protesters who were protesting at the site of two statues of Christopher Columbus and Juan Ponce de Le\xF3n near Bayside Market in Miami on June 10, The New York Times reported quoting the Miami Police Department.
During the demonstration, police officers established a skirmish line to prevent protesters from taking over the street, according to the police. The police claimed that Massri became irate as an officer was guiding her up the street, adding that the officer grabbed her after she continued to remain in the roadway and that she punched the officer in the right bicep with a closed fist.
Massri was arrested and charged with battery, resisting an officer with violence and disorderly conduct.
She was taken to a Miami-Dade County Corrections and Rehabilitation center where officers removed her hijab forcibly, according to Hassan Shibly, the chief executive director of CAIR Florida, a civil liberties and advocacy organization.

Omar Saleh, an attorney for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil liberties and advocacy group, slammed the incident.
He said that removing religious head coverings during booking procedures - whether a hijab, yumalke, or turban - is a severe violation of religious freedoms, NVS News reported.
It's not isolated. We've heard it before, and there have been lawsuits filed across the nation to rule this practice as unconstitutional, Saleh said, citing a few jurisdictions in California and Portland, Maine.
This isn't treatment that's unique to Muslims, but it's one where Muslim women who wear hijabs certainly bear the brunt of, Saleh said, adding, There needs to be change.

In 2019, state legislatures across the country modified rules and procedures related to every part of the criminal justice system, from pretrial detention to post-sentence re-entry. States passed new legislation and amended their criminal codes addressing a range of criminal justice concerns. A review of the legal landscape shows that states were most willing to adjust their criminal laws related to sentencing, record expungement and offender registries, marijuana legalization, and felon re-enfranchisement. This paper is not intended to serve as an exhaustive list of new criminal justice legislation in 2019, but rather highlights the most common reforms that fall generally among those categories.
As in 2018, criminal justice laws enacted in 2019 did not take a singular approach. Some states, for example, significantly enhanced penalties for certain offenses, while others reduced sentences and repealed mandatory minimums. Alaska adopted comprehensive criminal justice legislation that included repealing “catch and release” pretrial protocols, even as New York all but ended its pretrial detention and cash bail system. Three states revised rules for offender release and re-entry, and two states continued the national trend of restricting civil asset forfeiture and making the process more transparent. A handful of states amended their treatment of juvenile offenders, and several more stopped suspending driver’s licenses for unpaid fines and court costs.
Support for and opposition to criminal laws and punishments do not tend to break along traditional partisan lines. Although some legislative reforms proved to be politically contentious, including New York’s bail reform and Florida’s new re-enfranchisement requirements, others were largely bipartisan efforts wherein legislatures and governors from both ends of the political spectrum reached tenable compromises. Some legislatures even passed measures unanimously.
I. General Anti-Crime Legislation
Alaska enacted new anti-crime legislation in July 2019. In signing House Bill 49, a comprehensive crime-fighting reform package, Alaska Governor Michael Dunleavy warned criminals in his state: “This is not your time, and this is the time to get out of the state. With signing this bill, we’re serious. If you’re going to try and prey on Alaskans[,] we’re coming after you, we will prosecute you. If you hurt Alaskans, if you molest children, if you assault women, we’re really going to come after you. This has got to end.”[1]
House Bill 49 repeals and replaces much of Alaska’s 2016 criminal justice legislation, Senate Bill 91.[2] Governor Dunleavy’s election campaign in 2018 had emphasized public safety and support for law enforcement after Alaska saw its crime rate rise and Anchorage homicides hit record levels in 2017—one year after Senate Bill 91’s reforms took effect.[3] Primary provisions of House Bill 49 include enhanced penalties for sex offenses and drug possession and distribution, and significant revisions to sentencing guidelines, probation, parole, and what proponents described as the state’s “catch-and-release” bail policies.
Alaska’s new law enhances penalties for sex offenses against minors and incapacitated victims, indecent exposure, and the unlawful exploitation of a minor. The statute changes the mens rea requirement from “knowing” to “reckless” in second- and third-degree sexual assault cases in which the victim is incapacitated, mentally incapable, or unaware that a sexual act is being committed. The law makes sexual abuse of a minor a third-degree felony in cases involving a 6-year or more age difference, increasing the potential sentence from 0-2 years to 2-12 years. Alaska now requires anyone convicted of a registerable sex offense in another state to register in Alaska. And any solicitation of a minor for sex is now a class B felony.
House Bill 49 returns distribution of narcotics such as heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine to class A and B felonies, and it removes drug quantity as an element of the offense. The statute makes possession of these same narcotics a felony upon a second conviction, and it restores the state’s earlier anti-methamphetamine manufacturing provisions.
The new law reclassifies offenses and amends Alaska’s sentencing guidelines. The law repeals the state’s presumptive 30-day sentence for class A misdemeanors and returns discretion to judges to impose sentences up to one year. Class B misdemeanor sentences have been raised from 0-10 to 0-90 days. The law also increases sentence terms and maximum probation periods for felonies, and repeals mandatory electronic monitoring for first DUI offenses, returning discretion to the Department of Corrections.
Alaska kept its Pretrial Services Program, which provides pretrial release options for Alaska’s criminal courts, including bail, probation, parole, and electronic monitoring, but it removed the presumption of release from its pretrial risk assessment tool, increasing judicial discretion. The new law allows defendants to request a bail review hearing based on an inability to pay, but only if the defendant demonstrates a good faith effort to post bail. And jail credit for defendants who complete drug treatment programs while on pretrial release has been limited to 365 days.
Finally, the Alaska reform initiative significantly changes the state’s approach to probation and parole. The measure reduces the hours available in the earned compliance credits program to one-third of the probation or parole period, and bars the program altogether for sex offenders, unclassified offenders, those convicted of felonies against a person, and those convicted of domestic violence. The statute eliminates the mandated recommendation of early termination of probation or parole after one to two years, and instead returns to the recommendation of the probation or parole officer. Under the new law, inmates who were subject to disciplinary action while in prison must apply to be considered for discretionary parole. The statute restricts which crimes are eligible for discretionary parole and makes certain crimes ineligible, including non-sex class A felonies, class B felonies if the inmate had one or more prior felony convictions, class C felonies if the inmate had two or more prior felony convictions, and class B and C sex felonies.
Alaska’s comprehensive “tough-on-crime” overhaul stands in marked contrast to many of the other criminal justice reform initiatives pursued by most other states in 2019.
II. Sex Offenders &Child; Protection
Tennessee and New York enacted new legislation intended to protect children from convicted sex offenders.
A. Tennessee
Governor Bill Lee signed Senate Bill 425 on May 10, 2019, making it a felony for anyone convicted of a sex offense against a child to knowingly reside or have an overnight visit where a minor resides or is present.[4] Both chambers of the Tennessee legislature passed the legislation unanimously. Notwithstanding this provision, such an offender may reside or be alone with the offender’s own child unless: the offender’s parental rights have been or are in the process of being legally terminated; any minor or adult child of the offender was the offender’s victim; or the offender has been convicted of a sexual offense against a child under 12-years old.
Three unnamed plaintiffs challenged the statute on grounds that it violated their parental rights. A federal district court judge temporarily enjoined the law in July 2019, pending further litigation.[5]
B. New York
New York also strengthened its protections for minors against felony sex offenders. In August 2019, the state amended its domestic relations law and the family court act to create a rebuttable presumption that a child should not “be placed in the custody of or have unsupervised visits with a person who has been convicted of a felony sex offense . . .” in cases in which “the victim of such offense was the child who is the subject” of the visitation order.[6] Governor Andrew Cuomo called the amended law a “common sense” rule that “mandates that minors not be placed in the custody of or have unsupervised visits with anyone who committed a felony sex offense against them and ensuring the future wellbeing of these vulnerable children.”[7]
III. Penalty Enhancements
Two states—Kansas and Utah—enacted penalty-enhancing legislation. Kansas adopted “Mireya’s Law,” which stiffens penalties for crimes committed against young children. Utah passed “hate crime” legislation that increases penalties for criminals targeting members of protected classes.
A. Kansas
As part of Senate Bill 18, Governor Laura Kelly signed “Mireya’s Law” on May 13, 2019. The omnibus legislation amends various criminal statutes and, most notably, enhances penalties for involuntary manslaughter and abuse of a child. In cases involving victims under age 6, the law raises the penalty for involuntary manslaughter from a severity level 5 to a severity level 3 felony, and raises the penalty for abuse of a child from a severity level 5 to a severity level 4 felony.[8]
B. Utah
Utah enacted “hate crime” legislation, SB 103, which adds a mens rea element to crimes against persons and property, and increases penalties for offenses committed against victims in protected classes. The new law subjects criminal defendants to enhanced penalties in misdemeanor and felony cases in which the defendant intentionally selects the victim because the defendant believes that the victim has certain “personal attributes.” The newly protected “personal attributes” include age, ancestry, ethnicity, gender identity, national origin, political expression, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, service in the U.S. military, and status as a law enforcement officer or emergency responder.[9]
IV. Sentencing Reform
Five states amended their criminal or penal codes to reduce available penalties or to expand their sentence reduction programs.
A. Arizona
Arizona expanded eligibility for early release credits. Senate Bill 1310 extends the state’s earned early release program to inmates convicted of drug and drug paraphernalia possession.[10] Under the revised program, inmates convicted of possession may earn three days off of their sentence for every seven days served, if they have completed a drug treatment program while incarcerated and have never been convicted of a violent or aggravated felony. The amended statute also allows prisoners convicted of other crimes to earn one day of early release for every six days served.
B. California
California amended two sentencing-related provisions during 2019. Senate Bill 136 modifies the state’s statutory sentence enhancements. For non-violent felonies, California law had imposed an additional one-year term for each prior prison or county jail felony term, except under specified circumstances. The new law instead imposes that additional one-year term only for each prior separate prison term served for a violent sexual offense conviction.[11]
Assembly Bill 484 changes a condition of probation for those convicted of furnishing or transporting a controlled substance relating to the sale of cocaine, cocaine hydrochloride, or heroin.[12] As a condition of probation for such crimes, California had required at least 180 days in county jail. Under the new law, that 180-day minimum term became permissive rather than mandatory.
C. Illinois
Like Arizona, Illinois expanded eligibility for its sentencing credit program in 2019. House Bill 94 amended the state’s Unified Code of Corrections so that inmates serving sentences for convictions prior to June 1998 may be eligible for sentence credit for “any full-time substance abuse programs, correctional industry assignments, educational programs, behavior modification programs, life skills courses, or re-entry planning provided by the Department [of Corrections] . . . .”[13] Inmates may be eligible for 45 to 90 days of sentencing credit. With some statutory exceptions, the Department of Corrections also shall award an additional 180 days of sentence credit to prisoners who obtain a bachelor’s, master’s, or professional degree while in prison.
D. North Dakota
North Dakota joined the recent national trend of relaxing mandatory minimum terms for certain offenses and returning sentencing discretion to judges. House Bill 1183 removes mandatory minimum sentencing requirements for second and subsequent convictions for drug manufacturing or delivery.[14] The legislation easily passed in the state’s House of Representatives and passed in the Senate 44-1. Advocates, including North Dakota’s Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation officials, argued that mandatory minimums had been ineffective at deterring crime, and that the amended rule gives judges greater latitude in sentencing.[15]
E. Oklahoma
The Oklahoma legislature made retroactive a 2017 ballot initiative that reclassified simple drug possession and minor property crimes from felonies to misdemeanors. House Bill 1269 authorizes the Oklahoma Parole Board to commute sentences for nearly 1,000 inmates incarcerated for simple drug possession. The law also enables those convicted of the reclassified crimes to apply for record expungement 30 days after their sentence or commutation if they are not serving a sentence for another crime, they have paid any court-ordered restitution, and they have completed any court-ordered treatment program.[16]
V. Death Penalty &Life; Without Parole
Three states eliminated or reduced the availability of the death penalty or life-without-parole sentences for adults. California issued a moratorium on the death penalty, while Oregon substantially limited its applicability. Washington reduced the number of offenses for which adult life-without-parole is an available sentence.
A. California
Governor Gavin Newsom signed an executive order on March 13, 2019, granting “a reprieve for all people sentenced to death in California.”[17] The executive moratorium declared California’s death penalty system “unjust, unfair, wasteful, [and] protracted” in repealing California’s lethal injection protocol and immediately closing the “Death Chamber” at San Quentin penitentiary. The moratorium, however, did not provide for any person to be released from prison or for any current conviction or sentence to be changed.
B. Oregon
Oregon joined California in adjusting its death penalty provisions in 2019. Governor Kate Brown signed Senate Bill 1013 further limiting eligibility for the state’s death penalty by redefining aggravated murder, the only crime punishable by death in Oregon. The new law redefines aggravated murder as the premeditated and intentional killing of two or more people as an act of terrorism; the premeditated and intentional killing of a law enforcement officer or child younger than 14-years old; and second-degree murder committed while incarcerated for a prior murder.[18] During its passage, Oregon legislators assured voters that the new definition would not be retroactive or affect inmates already sentenced to death row. After its enactment, however, officials in the state’s Department of Justice opined that the new law, in fact, might be retroactive and that the state would be unlikely to prevail on challenges seeking retrial or new sentences. Legal challenges regarding the retroactive applicability of the new definition appear to be inevitable.
C. Washington
Senate Bill 5288 reduced the state’s list of “most serious offenses” eligible for life-without-parole sentences.[19] Effective July 28, 2019, judges could no longer sentence defendants convicted of second-degree robbery to life-without-parole in Washington.
VI. Bail Reform
After numerous states pursued bail reform initiatives in 2018, three more states followed suit in 2019. Colorado, Missouri, and New York each revised their approach to bail and pretrial detention, with New York most dramatically curtailing detention authority and eliminating bail for virtually all but the most violent offenses.
A. Colorado
In Colorado, Governor Jared Polis signed House Bill 1225, which eliminates cash bail for petty and municipal offenses,[20] and Senate Bill 191, which establishes timelines for bond hearings and creates protocols for electronic monitoring and releasing defendants before trial.[21]
B. Missouri
The Missouri Supreme Court promulgated new bail rules on December 18, 2018, that became effective July 1, 2019, which require state courts to start with non-monetary conditions of release and impose monetary conditions only if necessary for safety reasons. State courts must first consider how to minimize or waive defendant court costs before imposing them. Under the extensive new rules, the courts may order pretrial detention only if—by clear and convincing evidence—no combination of monetary and non-monetary conditions will ensure the safety of the community. Finally, Missouri’s bail rules aim to ensure speedy trials for those remaining in jail by limiting how long courts may detain defendants without a hearing.[22]
C. New York
New York overhauled its pretrial bail regime in 2019, with the new law taking effect on January 1, 2020.[23] The Empire State eliminated cash bail for the vast majority of defendants, including most arrested for drug possession or property crimes such as theft and burglary. Bail reform advocates had pressed hard for New York to repeal bail in all cases, but the new legislation preserves judicial authority to remand defendants to jail and set bail for those charged with violent felonies, witness intimidation or tampering, or violating a protective order against a household member.[24] Legislators, law enforcement, activists, and the state judiciary debated various reform provisions for months, including the “dangerousness standard” that would grant judges some discretion in deciding whether to detain a defendant pending trial. Supporters of the dangerousness standard argued that such common-sense discretion would help keep violent offenders off the street, while opponents worried that it would perpetuate racial bias in the judicial system.[25] Opponents of the discretionary dangerousness standard prevailed. New York’s sweeping reform allows judges to only consider evidence relevant to whether the defendant will appear for court dates, and it repeals old provisions that permitted judges to consider the defendant’s probability of conviction at trial.
Almost immediately after implementation, the new law generated substantial media attention and controversy following the New York Police Department’s release of data indicating an increase in crime.[26] That attention and controversy led New York officials to revisit the 2019 legislation and amend it in the state’s 2021 budget. Ultimately, the New York General Assembly made a list of crimes re-eligible for bail, including second-degree burglary, child pornography, vehicular manslaughter, sex trafficking, certain domestic violence offenses, and a litany of crimes against children.[27]
VII. Criminal Record &Offender; Registry Reform
Half a dozen states took steps to modify their criminal record and sex-offender registry protocols and requirements. Five of those six states—Colorado, Delaware, New Jersey, Utah, and West Virginia—made it easier for some criminal records to be expunged under certain conditions.
A. California
California amended two statutes related to criminal recordkeeping. The first, Assembly Bill 1076, creates an automated record-clearance system for low-level offenses.[28] In California, a person who was arrested and has successfully completed a pre-filing diversion program, a drug diversion program, a deferred entry of judgment program, or a person whose arrest did not result in a conviction, may petition the court to seal the arrest record. Under state law, if a defendant successfully completes certain diversion programs, the arrest for the crime for which the defendant was diverted is deemed to have never occurred. California also allows defendants to petition to withdraw pleas of guilty or nolo contendere and enter pleas of not guilty, if they have fulfilled the conditions of probation and are not then serving a sentence, on probation, or charged with any offense. If relief is granted, California requires the court to dismiss the accusation or information against the defendant and release the defendant from all penalties and disabilities resulting from the offense, with exceptions. Effective January 1, 2021, California will require the state’s Department of Justice periodically to review the records in the statewide criminal justice databases and to identify persons who are eligible for relief by having their arrest records, or their criminal conviction records, withheld from disclosure, as specified. The new law, enacted in October 2019, requires California’s Department of Justice to grant relief to eligible persons without requiring a petition or motion. The law also requires an update to the state summary criminal history information documenting the relief granted; and the Department must electronically notify the relevant superior court of all cases for which relief was granted.
The second, Assembly Bill 1331, addresses data gaps and improves access to criminal justice data by establishing reporting requirements across the system and clarifying existing law regarding access.[29] California law authorizes public criminal justice agencies and certain criminal justice researchers to access criminal record information required for their duties, provided that personal identifying information is not transferred, revealed, or used for anything other than research or statistical activities; that reports or publications derived from that information do not identify specific individuals; and that the agency or researcher pays the cost for processing the data. As of July 1, 2020, Assembly Bill 1331 requires that criminal record information also include criminal court records, and prohibits a person from being denied access to that information solely on the basis of that person’s criminal record, unless that person has been convicted of a felony or any offense involving moral turpitude, dishonesty, or fraud.
B. Colorado
Colorado’s House Bill 1275 streamlines the process and increases eligibility to seal criminal records without filing for such action in civil court, and it requires courts to expunge the arrest and criminal records of any person arrested due to mistaken identity and who did not have charges filed against him or her.[30] Under the new law, job and student applicants may not be required to disclose any information contained in expunged records, nor be made to answer questions concerning arrest and criminal records information that have been expunged, but instead may state that no such action ever occurred.
C. Delaware
In June 2019, Governor John Carney signed amendments to Delaware’s rules for expunging adult criminal records.[31] State law had allowed adults to petition to have a record expunged in only two circumstances—for an arrest that did not lead to conviction and after a pardon had been granted—and only for certain misdemeanors. Delaware’s new law now allows adult records to be expunged by petition to the State Bureau of Identification for charges resolved in favor of the petitioner; for records that include some violations more than three years old; and for some misdemeanors more than five years old. Delaware law specifically bars expunging convictions for second degree vehicular assault; incest; unlawful sexual contact in the third degree; coercion; and certain crimes committed against children. Under the new law, many misdemeanor convictions are not eligible for mandatory expungement, including domestic violence, sexual harassment, first- and second-degree indecent exposure, resisting arrest, hate crime, patronizing or permitting prostitution, and illegally concealing a dangerous weapon.
D. New Jersey
New Jersey also revised its criminal records expungement statute to allow those with low-level drug and nonviolent offenses to have their records expunged provided that they do not commit another offense for 10 years.[32]
E. Utah
Utah amended its rules for expungement and added new provisions to its sex offender registry requirements. House Bill 431 allows for automatic expungement of charges of which a person has been acquitted, charges that have been dismissed with prejudice, and certain misdemeanor convictions.[33] The law establishes processes for automatic expungement and deletion, which include modifying the circumstances under which the state may petition a court to open an expunged record.
In March 2019, Governor Gary Herbert signed HB 298, which adds a new petition provision for convicted sex offenders.[34] Utah requires convicted sex offenders to register for a period of 10 years after their sentence terminates. The new law allows such sex offenders to petition the court to be removed from the registry as early as 10 years after being sentenced to probation or committed to a community-based residential program, or 10 years after release from incarceration to parole. Courts may grant such requests as long as the petitioning sex offender commits no further serious offense, completes treatment, pays restitution, and otherwise complies with the terms of registration.
F. West Virginia
Senate Bill 152 makes most nonviolent state felonies eligible for expungement in West Virginia.[35] Those convicted of nonviolent felonies must be out of prison and off parole for five years before petitioning for expungement. Those convicted of nonviolent misdemeanors must be out of jail and off parole for between one and two years. Under the expanded eligibility requirements, West Virginia still charges a non-refundable filing fee and allows petitioners to request expungement only once. The new law went into effect in June 2019.
VIII. Marijuana &Drug; Law Reform
Six states continued the nationwide trend of liberalizing marijuana and drug possession laws, including reducing penalties for possessing amounts consistent with personal and medicinal use. Notably, Illinois established a statewide regime to tax and regulate cannabis similar to the way it controls alcohol. Minnesota did not modify its marijuana policy, but it did significantly increase licensing and registration fees for drug-makers and distributors in an aggressive revenue-raising effort to combat the state’s opioid epidemic.
A. Colorado
House Bill 1263 reduced personal drug possession of fewer than 4 grams from a felony to a misdemeanor in Colorado and eliminated the potential for criminal charges for drug residue found on drug paraphernalia. Under the statute, possession of more than 12 ounces of marijuana or three ounces of marijuana concentrate is no longer a level-four felony; and possession of more than six ounces of marijuana is now a level-one drug misdemeanor.[36] The new law took effect on March 1, 2020.
B. Florida
The Florida legislature relaxed its medical marijuana restrictions by redefining “medical use” to include the possession, use, and administering of marijuana in a form conducive with smoking.[37] Senate Bill 182 effectively repealed Florida’s ban on smoking marijuana for medical purposes.
C. Hawaii
After acknowledging that dozens of states already have decriminalized the use of medical marijuana, Hawaii’s House Bill 1383 decriminalized possession of up to three grams, but established that possession of such an amount is punishable by a $130 fine. The new law, which took effect without Governor David Ige’s signature, also provides for expungement of criminal records pertaining to possession of three grams or less of marijuana.
D. Illinois
In May 2019, Illinois’s General Assembly determined that the state would tax and regulate marijuana “in a manner similar to alcohol.” Accordingly, House Bill 1438 provides in relevant part:
(1) persons will have to show proof of age before purchasing cannabis; (2) selling, distributing, or transferring cannabis to minors and other persons under 21 years of age shall remain illegal; (3) driving under the influence of cannabis shall remain illegal; (4) legitimate, taxpaying business people, and not criminal actors, will conduct sales of cannabis; (5) cannabis sold in this State will be tested, labeled, and subject to additional regulation to ensure that purchasers are informed and protected; and (6) purchasers will be informed of any known health risks associated with the use of cannabis, as concluded by evidence-based, peer reviewed research.”[38]
The statute legalizes possession of up to 30 grams of marijuana, up to five grams of concentrated cannabis, and products containing up to 500 milligrams of THC for any Illinois resident who is at least 21 years old, but consuming marijuana in public places remains illegal.
E. Minnesota
Minnesota substantially increased licensing and registration fees for prescription drug manufacturers and distributors to help raise revenue for the state’s anti-addiction and prevention efforts. Drug wholesalers and manufacturers of even non-opiate drugs accustomed to paying state licensing application fees under $250 will now pay $5,000, along with an annual $5,000 licensing renewal fee. Companies that manufacture certain controlled substances containing opiates must now pay a registration and annual renewal fee of $55,000.[39]
F. New Mexico
Senate Bill 323 reduces New Mexico’s penalties for first-time possession of up to one-half ounce of cannabis from a criminal misdemeanor—punishable by up to 15 days in jail—to a “penalty assessment,” punishable by a $50 fine.[40] Subsequent offenses and possession of greater amounts of marijuana remain punishable by the possibility of jail time.
G. New York
New York amended its penal code to reduce penalties for first- and second-degree possession of marijuana and marijuana products. The amended code makes second-degree possession punishable only by a fine of not more than $50, and it raises the amount needed for first-degree possession from 25 grams to one ounce, punishable only by a fine of not more than $200.[41]
IX. Juvenile Justice Reform
California, Michigan, and Oregon amended their treatment of juvenile defendants and juvenile records.
A. California
California law authorizes district attorneys to request that minors be transferred from juvenile court to a court of criminal jurisdiction in cases in which a minor is alleged to have committed a felony when the minor was 16 years of age or older. After a fitness hearing, the law requires the juvenile court to determine whether the minor should be transferred to a court of criminal jurisdiction and to recite the basis for its decision. In 2019, California enacted Assembly Bill 1423, which allows a person whose case was transferred from juvenile court to a criminal court to request that the case return to juvenile court under certain circumstances, including when the person is convicted at trial only of an offense that was not the basis for the transfer from juvenile court to the criminal court.[42]
The California Assembly also enacted Assembly Bill 1394, eliminating fees charged by a superior court or probation department to an applicant who petitions to seal juvenile court records.[43]
B. Michigan
In October 2019, Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed 18 bills as part of a “Raise the Age” legislative package. The bipartisan legislation, which takes effect October 21, 2021, raises the age of whom the state considers an adult under the criminal justice system from 17 to 18 years old. Michigan joined 46 states in ending the practice of charging 17 year olds as adults.[44] The new law requires anyone under 18 to be treated as a minor in juvenile court and receive the rehabilitation services offered in the juvenile justice system. Although most crimes will be subject to the new age threshold, prosecutors retain discretion to prosecute underage violent offenders as adults.
One of the package’s sponsors, Sen. Peter Lucido, praised the legislative effort, stating:
This long-overdue reform will ensure youth who are charged with criminal acts will, in most cases, be treated as the children they are. While they will still be held accountable for their actions, they also will have the opportunity to learn from their mistakes and have a better chance of becoming productive members of society.[45]
C. Oregon
Oregon enacted Senate Bill 1008, abolishing life-without-parole sentences for minors, expanding opportunities for early release, and restricting the prosecution of children as adults.[46] The new bipartisan legislation is not retroactive, but it significantly amends Measure 11, a 1994 ballot initiative that, among other things, required that anyone over age 15 who is charged with a qualifying offense be tried as an adult. Those qualifying offenses carried mandatory minimum sentences. Amending Measure 11 required a two-thirds majority in both legislative chambers, and the Oregon Senate reached that threshold with no votes to spare. Although the Oregon statute still allows juveniles to be prosecuted as adults in some circumstances, such prosecutions will no longer be automatic or mandatory as they were formerly, and prosecutors must now request and receive court approval to pursue such prosecutions.
X. Civil Asset Forfeiture
In 2019, two states enacted civil asset forfeiture reforms to curb the controversial practice of governments seizing private property prior to a criminal conviction. Arkansas all but banned such seizure altogether.
A. Arkansas
Arkansas became the fourth state to abolish or severely limit civil asset forfeiture, joining Nebraska, North Carolina, and New Mexico. The legislation passed both chambers of the Arkansas legislature unanimously. Since Governor Asa Hutchinson signed Senate Bill 308, the state now requires prosecutors to obtain a criminal conviction before seized property is forfeited.[47] There are several exceptions to that requirement, including cases in which the property owner is dead, deported, flees the jurisdiction, or does not challenge the forfeiture.
B. Michigan
Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed House Bill 4001-02 and Senate Bill 2, bipartisan legislation that prohibits assets taken in suspected drug cases from being forfeited unless the defendant is later convicted or the value of the money and property is more than $50,000, excluding the value of the contraband.[48]
XI. Felon Enfranchisement
Re-enfranchising convicted felons proved to be a recurring theme in 2019. Six states passed or amended legislation related to voting rights for convicts. In November 2018, Florida voters amended the state’s constitution to restore voting rights to felons. Less than a year later, the Florida legislature garnered national attention when it passed Senate Bill 7066, requiring felons to repay all financial obligations associated with their criminal records before their right to vote is restored, including court fees, fines, and restitution to victims. The new prerequisites met with immediate court challenges. The other five states adopted measures that ease or expand voting rights for felons.
A. Colorado
Colorado law previously barred felons serving prison terms or parole from voting or registering to vote in any election. House Bill 1266, passed in the summer of 2019, re-enfranchises those serving a parole sentence by clarifying that, “for purposes of the ‘Uniform Election Code’ and for applying state constitutional provisions governing disenfranchisement during imprisonment, persons sentenced to parole have completed their ‘full term of imprisonment’ as that term appears in the state constitution.”[49] Accordingly, the new law adds Colorado to the growing list of states that allow released and paroled felons to register to vote and to vote in any election.
B. Florida
Through a November 2018 ballot initiative, Florida voters—by a 64.5% supermajority—passed Amendment 4, the Voting Rights Restoration for Felons Initiative, amending the state constitution. With exceptions for those convicted of murder or felony sexual assault, the amendment automatically restores the right to vote for people with prior felony convictions upon completion of their sentences, including prison, parole, and probation. In June 2019, Governor Ron DeSantis signed Senate Bill 7066, which requires felons to repay all financial obligations associated with their criminal record, including court fees, fines, and full payment of restitution, before they can regain the right to vote.[50] A flurry of lawsuits and constitutional challenges to Senate Bill 7066 followed, arguing, among other things, that the law’s pecuniary requirements for repaying fees, fines, and restitution essentially functions as a “poll tax” and violates the 14th, 15th, and 24th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. In May 2020, a federal district court largely agreed with the petitioners and ruled against the state.[51] Florida has appealed the district court’s decision to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.
C. Illinois
Senate Bill 2090 directs Illinois county jails and local election officials to establish processes for allowing detainees awaiting trial to cast ballots by mail or at temporary polling stations inside county jails.[52] The new legislation also requires the state’s Department of Corrections and county jails to provide incarcerated non-felons with voter registration applications and detailed information about voting rights.
D. Kentucky
Governor Andy Beshear issued an executive order on December 19, 2019, re-enfranchising convicted felons who have completed their sentences.[53] The order expressly does not apply to those convicted of treason, bribery in an election, homicide, assault in the second degree, strangulation, human trafficking, or certain violent offenses defined by law.[54]
E. Nevada
Assembly Bill 431 maintains the voting rights of those convicted of a crime who are not currently in prison, and it restores voting rights to those convicted of a felony immediately upon their release from prison.[55] The new law, signed by Governor Steve Sisolak, passed the state Senate on a party line vote with all eight Republicans voting against the measure, and it mustered only three Republican votes in the Assembly. The provisions took effect July 1, 2019.
F. New Jersey
Just before Christmas 2019, Governor Phil Murphy restored voting rights to felons on probation and parole when he signed A5823 into law.[56] The governor observed that felons on probation and parole “are residents who are living as full participants in their communities and yet have been needlessly prevented from having a voice in the future direction of their communities.”[57] The new law became effective in March 2020 and will immediately affect an estimated 80,000 felons on probation and parole in New Jersey.
XII. Release &Re;-Entry Reform
California, Illinois, and Texas enacted legislation affecting various aspects of prisoner release or re-entry into society.
A. California
California enacted Assembly Bill 433 in 2019, which now requires a hearing in open court before terminating probation early.[58] The new law also requires that the victims of the crime at issue and the prosecuting attorneys be notified of the hearing for early termination of probation.? California also repealed its requirement that those convicted of certain drug offenses (in or out of the state) register with local law enforcement upon arrival and provide their fingerprints and a photograph.[59]
B. Illinois
Illinois enhanced its prison education system by requiring the state’s Department of Corrections and Department of Juvenile Justice to provide a nonpartisan, peer-taught civics program to teach civics workshops to detainees shortly before they re-enter society.[60] The new program created by House Bill 2541 is designed to improve re-integration and reduce recidivism by helping detainees re-entering society to better understand their civic responsibility and how to regain their right to vote. Workshop participants will be instructed on voting rights, governmental institutions, current affairs, elections, the democratic process, and voter registration. Re-entering detainees must enroll in the new program within 12 months of their scheduled release.
C. Texas
Texas adopted two provisions designed to make it easier for former inmates to obtain employment after their release. House Bill 918 provides discharged inmates with access to important documents, including social security cards, birth certificates, and work history, after release from a correctional facility.[61] House Bill 1342 amended the state’s occupational licensing provisions so that licensing authorities may no longer suspend, revoke, or deny a license to an applicant on the grounds that the person has been convicted of an offense that does not directly relate to the duties and responsibilities of the licensed occupation. With some limitations, the statute also allows licensing authorities to accept an applicant’s education, training, and work experience while in prison as evidence of the applicant’s eligibility for an occupational license.[62]
XIII. Driver’s License Suspension Reform
Four states revised their driver’s license suspension policies in 2019. Montana, Tennessee, and Virginia each ended their respective practices of suspending driver’s licenses due to unpaid court fines, costs, or restitution.[63] Texas repealed its Driver Responsibility Program that had required those convicted of certain traffic offenses to pay an annual surcharge—in addition to court fines and penalties—in order to maintain their driving privileges.[64]
XIV. Conclusion
A significant number of states maintained the trend of amending their criminal codes in 2019. New laws and amendments varied from state to state, with some pursuing robust reforms and others enacting more modest changes. Some states enhanced penalties for those convicted, while others eased restrictions on those awaiting trial. Sentencing reform, relaxed marijuana restrictions, and felon re-enfranchisement were recurring themes, and one state adopted sweeping anti-crime initiatives.

AG Racine selected 'The People v. Hate: Standing Up for Humanity' as his presidential initiative. Montana AG and 2020 NAAG President Tim Fox[2] received the annual Kelley-Wyman Award, NAAG's highest honor, which is awarded for doing the most to achieve NAAG objectives. Both the NAAG presidential election and the award ceremony were part of NAAG's annual Capital Forum, held virtually this year on December 2.AntitrustFTC Puts the Breaks on P&#38;G's Acquisition of DTC Razor Startup, Billie The Federal Trade Commission[3] ('FTC') filed an administrative complaint and authorized a lawsuit in federal court to block The Procter &#38; Gamble Company's ('P&#38;G') proposed acquisition of direct-to-consumer ('DTC') razor and body care products company, Billie, Inc. 
('Billie'). According to the FTC's press release, the complaint is based on allegations that the proposed acquisition would eliminate growing competition in the wet-shave razors market. The FTC claims that Billie, which sells mid-tier women's razors, competes head-to-head with market-leading P&#38;G, and has seen its online sales grow significantly in the two years since it was formed. The FTC states that the proposed acquisition would eliminate competition between the two companies, and that the announced deal had already derailed Billie's planned expansion into brick-and-mortar stores, which the FTC believes would have benefitted consumers through stronger competition at retail locations. The FTC stated that it intends to file a complaint in federal court seeking a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to stop the deal pending an administrative trial.Consumer Financial Protection BureauMortgage Servicer Agrees to Pay over $86 Million to Settle Suits by CFPB, Attorneys General The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau[4] ('CFPB'), a multistate group of 51 AGs, and 53 state bank regulators reached a settlement with Nationstar Mortgage, LLC, d/b/a Mr. Cooper ('Nationstar') to resolve allegations that it improperly serviced thousands of mortgage loans in violation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Homeowners Protection Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and its implementing regulations, Regulation X, and the respective states' consumer protection laws. The CFPB complaint[5] alleged that, among other things, Nationstar failed to identify and honor borrowers' loan modification agreements, foreclosed on borrowers to whom it had promised foreclosure holds, improperly increased borrowers' monthly loan payments despite modifications to their accounts, and failed to properly manage borrowers' escrow accounts. Under the terms of the CFPB stipulated judgment[6] and the concurrently filed proposed consent judgment[7] with the states, Nationstar will pay approximately $86 million in consumer recoveries, fees, and penalties, including a $1.5 million civil money penalty to the CFPB. The CFPB settlement also requires Nationstar to create a comprehensive mortgage servicing compliance plan, including revised policies and procedures regarding error resolution, management of escrow accounts, and service transfers.Consumer ProtectionMassachusetts Attorney General Sues Health Insurance Company over Allegations It Deceptively Marketed Supplemental Insurance Plans Massachusetts AG Maura Healey[8] sued healthcare insurance company HealthMarkets, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively 'HealthMarkets') over allegations that HealthMarkets misled consumers into purchasing supplemental health insurance products in violation of the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act and a 2009 consent judgment enjoining the parent company and two other subsidiaries from similar conduct. The complaint[9] alleges that HealthMarkets deceived consumers seeking traditional health insurance into instead buying unnecessary supplemental health insurance. In addition, the complaint alleges that HealthMarkets's advertising was misleading because, among other reasons, it claimed that its sales agents were objective, that their services were free, and that they represented all insurance carriers, but in reality they were incentivized with higher commission rates to sell HealthMarkets's supplemental insurance, consumers were sometimes charged fees for services, and they did not represent all carriers. The complaint seeks forfeiture or suspension of HealthMarkets's rights to do business in Massachusetts, declaratory and injunctive relief, restitution, civil money penalties, and attorneys' fees and costs.False ClaimsNew York Supermarket Chain Settles Allegations of Tax Avoidance New York AG Letitia James[10] reached a settlement with supermarket chain owner Hi Jong Lee and his chain of supermarkets (collectively 'Food World') to resolve allegations of fraudulent tax avoidance in violation of the New York False Claims Act, New York Tax Act, and Executive Law. According to the stipulation and settlement agreement[11], which stems from a whistleblower lawsuit, Food World allegedly avoided paying taxes by using lottery cash registers that were not connected to the store's sales system to process purchases of supermarket items that were not declared for income tax or sales tax purposes at the time. In addition, Food World allegedly avoided taxes by generating fake merchandise returns receipts and by paying the majority of Food World employees in cash and off the books in order to avoid tax deductions. Under the terms of the settlement, Food World will pay $4.7 million, of which approximately $3.7 million will be paid to the state and $1 million to the whistleblower. In addition, Food World will pay $110,000 for the whistleblower's attorneys' fees and costs.

Three people, includingProud Boys chairman Enrique Tarrio, sustained non-life threatening injuries during the attack in the 1400 block of New York Avenue, Northwest at around 2:26 a.m. in the early hours of Wednesday.
A video of the attack was shared online, with the victims accusing those attacking them of being BLM protesters. Tarrio also described the assailants as being from BLM, on social media site Parler.
Police said they are searching for three suspects, two men and one woman, in connection to the attack. Officers originally told several local news outlets that the suspects were part of BLM.
The incident occurred as hundreds of people from all sides of the political spectrum gathered on the streets of the capital as the results from the election started to roll in.
Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, Chief Peter Newsham pulled back on the earlier information released by police, adding they have not verified any specific affiliation of the suspects or victims nor established any motive.
""At 2:30 in the morning when officers are trying to gather information on the scene, that information is preliminary in nature and oftentimes, unfortunately, it changes,"" Newsham said. ""So all I can say is that after more extensive investigation with the victims of the crime, we don't know who they were affiliated with.""
He added that if the victims were attacked because of their ""political affiliation"" then it will be investigated as a hate crime.
In a statement, BLM DC condemned the police, accusing them of trying to discredit their movement as part of a ""sustained campaign of copaganda.""
""We condemn the MPD's intentional spread of disinformation that emboldens white supremacists and undermines our movement in defense of Black lives,"" BLM DC said.
""We demand an immediate and full retraction of the outright lie spread by the MPD that BLM had anything to do with what did, or did not happen. MPD's statement serves no other purpose than to stoke fear and incite violence on our communities. It is alarming that MPD would release this statement without any actual knowledge that BLM had something to do with did or did not happen,"" they added.
""MPD has shown us they will protect white supremacists and criminalize BLM. White supremacist get private metro trains, police caravan and protection from MPD but Black lives get criminalized and persecuted in the media and criminal legal system.""
Proud Boys deny they are a white supremacist hate group and instead described themselves as all-male ""western chauvinists.""
Another victim, Bevelyn Beatty, who is Black, is a critic of the BLM movement and was previously accused of tearing down a fence that had become a Black Lives Matter memorial between the White House and Black Lives Matter Plaza.
Beatty also said BLM were behind the attack in an Instagram video posted from a hospital bed.
Writing on Parler, Tarrio added: ""Besides a slash I'm ok. Bevelyn has a collapsed lung and is currently recovering. The other two Proud Boys were stabbed in the ear and trap [sic]. They have been released by the hospital.""
MPD have been contacted for further comment.

68,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_751/Files (250).DOCX","Newstex Blogs",2020-11-10,"1510 words",NA,"Jeanmarie Evelly",NA,"DA Hopeful Calls for Cracking Down on Elder Scams—and Failing Nursing Homes",FALSE,"Nov 10, 2020( City Limits: http://www.citylimits.org Delivered by Newstex) Lucy Lang says prosecutors have a role advocating for better oversight of long-term care facilities, and pursuing those who harm the elderly.Lang for DA Lucy Lang is one of a crowded field of candidates for Manhattan DA. The COVID-19 crisis wears on. The number of cases steadily climbs. The death toll slowly mounts. The economic damage deepens. And for those determined to use fear and confusion to rip off the elderly, the opportunities to exploit the virus proliferate.The Federal Communications Commission has warned about a menu of COVID-19 scams[1] targeting older people, from calls about phony Social Security benefit suspensions to fake IRS warnings about overdue payments to fictitious investment opportunities. All targeted were in a demographic group that has suffered mightily from the disease itself. 
https://citylimits.org/series/election-2020/ Lucy Lang, a Democrat running for Manhattan District Attorney, on Tuesday unveiled a proposal for a criminal crackdown on elder scams—and unhealthy nursing homes.The latter proposal could introduce a new element into the ongoing debate over whether the large COVID-19 death toll in New York nursing homes—at least 6,000 deaths—is primarily the result of poor care by the homes, decisions by the Cuomo administration, or simply the ravages of a highly contagious and deadly pathogen.Lang spent 12 years in the Manhattan DA's office before leaving to head the Institute for Innovation in Prosecution at John Jay College. She is one of a very crowded field seeking to unseat incumbent DA Cyrus Vance, who has been in office since 2010. With every candidate embracing the call for deeper reform of the criminal justice system, many of the hopefuls have sought to distinguish themselves by proposing more dramatic changes or staking out new areas where prosecutors might focus their powers.Decrying the cruelty of death by incarceration[2], Tahanie Aboushi has vowed not to seek any sentences of greater than 20 years. Janos Martin proposes a restorative justice[3] program. Alvin Bragg would hire people who were once incarcerated to lead efforts to make prison reentry work better[4]. Dan Quart wants to end mass gang arrests[5] based on surveillance or databases. Environmental justice[6] is one thing Tali Farhadian Weinstein has focused on, while Liz Crotty has called for changing how hate crimes[7] are dealt with, and Diana Florence wants to use prosecutorial power to combat unaffordable housing. [8]Eliza Orlins is vowing to create 'specialized bureaus[9] to combat corrupt public officials, exploitative landlords and employers' as well as cops who 'commit acts of physical abuse and perjury and who engage in violations of civil rights.'Lang probably has the most detailed policy platform[10] at present. Most of them address familiar criminal-justice reform topics, but she says the focus on elder scams grew out of 'talking to neighbors and friends throughout New York who were concerned about the increasing appearance of people looking to take advantage of the pandemic.'Her proposal calls for creating a task-force to coordinate existing elements of the DA's office, like the Elder Abuse Unit and Special Victims Bureau, to focus on COVID-19 fraud against older people and other vulnerable New Yorkers. The task force would last well beyond the end of the pandemic—'for as long as the statute of limitations allows,' Lang's campaign literature says.Lang also promises to 'investigate nursing homes that fail to meet public health requirements.''Given the increased risk of COVID-19 in congregant living environments and the disproportionate number of preventable deaths in nursing homes, the government has a duty to make sure that residents are not put needlessly at risk,' a campaign policy paper reads. The DA's role will be to advocate for more oversight but also to 'where appropriate, prosecute nursing homes for financial fraud, kickbacks, or fraudulent assurances of compliance with COVID-19 regulations designed to save lives.'Cuomo's order in March requiring nursing homes to accept COVID-19 patients being discharged from hospitals came in for withering criticism as the death toll mounted in congregate settings. The governor produced research[11] indicating that staff members, not residents, were likely what fueled the rapid and deadly spread of the disease in homes, but some have questioned those findings[12]. Lang did not take sides. 'I can't speak to what caused the conflagration of cases,' she said. 'It should be investigated.'The state Department of Health is primarily responsible for regulating nursing homes, although the federal Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services can also promulgate rules that affect long-term care facilities. Among those other players, Lang sees the DA 'as serving in a supporting and convening role,' she says - doing things like making sure subpoenas are obeyed and, when there's criminal behavior, using the tools of criminal prosecution.A key part of the work is understanding the vulnerabilities of older people, who might fear retaliation for reporting crimes, or not have the kind of communication access that permits them to easily ask for help. With that in mind, she plans to hire outreach workers who connect with members of their communities to help victims feel more comfortable reporting. The task-force itself will include prosecutors and investigators as well as social workers and clinicians, and it will work with community-based organizations to aggregate cases and identify trends.Lang acknowledges that many of the problems faced by New York's elders, in nursing homes or elsewhere, might not be the result of intentional criminal acts but resource disparities or other structural issues. Understanding those is part of the role of the task-force, she says. When criminal activity is uncovered, throwing someone in jail will not necessarily be the response.'As DA, I will intentionally seek to shrink the criminal-justice footprint. That doesn't mean withdrawing from protecting people,' she says. Ideally, she adds, it means finding solutions that avoid prosecution.Vance himself has pursued elder abuse cases. In 2018, his office charged a real-estate broker with using an elderly victim's property to secure $8 million in fraudulent loans. In 2017, he went after a home-health aide for taking $300,000 from an elderly couple. Predatory bank employees, a larcenous sweet-shop worker[13] and people who allegedly perpetrated a 'Chinese blessing' scam[14] have also been prosecuted for scamming older people.However, Elizabeth Loewy, who established the Elder Abuse Unit at the Manhattan DA's Office under then-District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, praised Lang's proposal.'Lucy's plan to address COVID-related scams is proactive and will help protect seniors and vulnerable populations in Manhattan,' Loewy says. 'Elder financial abuse is a critical issue that robs seniors of billions of dollars every year, and I'm glad to see a candidate for District Attorney tackle this issue head-on.''I'm glad to see elder abuse will receive much needed attention,' says Bobbie Sackman, a veteran advocate for the aging. She feels the next DA could focus even more broadly on the risks faced by senior citizens.'This [policy] raises the issue of scams, which are important, of course, but elders are at increased risk of abuse by their own family members—most frequently, financial abuse, but also physical, emotional and sometimes sexual abuse.''I really like the nursing home piece,' Sackman added. 'The state just doesn't do its job taking on the poor care that's gone on there for decades which COVID blew open.' The post DA Hopeful Calls for Cracking Down on Elder Scams—and Failing Nursing Homes[15] appeared first on City Limits[16].

69,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_751/Files (250).DOCX","The New York Times",2020-08-30,"3333 words","Section AR; Column 0; Arts and Leisure Desk; Pg. 5; CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK","By Michael Kimmelman",NA,"This Neighborhood Contains Multitudes",FALSE,"With a population of around 180,000 people speaking some 167 languages, or so locals like to point out, Jackson Heights in north-central Queens, though barely half the size of Central Park, is the most culturally diverse neighborhood in New York, if not on the planet. The brainchild of commercial real estate developers in the early years of the last century who hoped to entice white, middle-class Manhattanites seeking a suburban lifestyle a short subway ride away, Jackson Heights has become a magnet for Latinos, those who identify as L.G.B.T.Q., South Asians and just about everybody else seeking a foothold in the city and a slice of the American pie. 
 Suketu Mehta is a New York University professor and the author of ''Maximum City: Bombay Lost and Found'' and ''This Land Is Our Land: An Immigrant's Manifesto.'' What follows is the latest in a series of (edited, condensed) walks around the city.
 Even by New York standards, Jackson Heights is changing so fast and contains so many different communities that no single walk can begin to take in the whole neighborhood. There's a booming Latin American cultural scene, a growing Nepali and Tibetan contingent, an urban activist movement, pioneering car bans on local streets. This is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's district, and it is represented by a longtime openly gay city councilman named Daniel Dromm. It was also one of the neighborhoods hardest hit by the Covid-19 outbreak in the spring.
 Mehta was born in Kolkata, India and raised in Mumbai. He moved with his family to Jackson Heights in 1977. His parents came to expand the family diamond business. At that time, he was 14 and, like the city, Jackson Heights was going through a rough patch.
 He and I ''met'' the other day (virtually, by phone) at Diversity Plaza, the blocklong stretch of street, pedestrianized in 2012, which has become Jackson Heights's de facto town square and a proud symbol of Queens as the city's most international borough. Half a block away, Patel Brothers, the Indian grocer, does brisk business. The plaza attracts tourists coming off the subway, looking for cheap eats, and is a meeting spot for locals, who hang out and debate politics, pick up prescriptions from the Bangladeshi pharmacy, and buy momos and samosas from the shops and food stalls that, cheek by jowl, pack both sides of the block.
 Michael Kimmelman It's almost miraculous, the effect just closing off a single street to cars has had.
 Suketu Mehta If I were Baudelaire, this is where I would do my flâneur thing. For a dollar you can get some paan and eavesdrop.
 Paan, the betel leaf.
 You'll notice all these signs around the plaza pleading with people not to spit betel juice.
 In vain, clearly.
 As in the homeland, such pleas tend to be honored more in the breach. I also want to point out a food bazaar in the plaza called Ittadi.
 Occupying a former Art Deco movie palace from the 1930s.
 It was originally called the Earle. When I was growing up, the Earle showed pornographic films. By the '80s it had turned into a Bollywood theater. The new owners didn't want to invest in a wholesale remaking of the old Earle sign, so they just changed one letter and renamed it the Eagle. You could see the G was in a totally different font. The Eagle remained popular until video stores around the corner started selling cheap pirated copies of the same films that were showing in the theater. I remember walking into one of those stores with a Bollywood director, Vidhu Vinod Chopra, with whom I had written a script. Without saying who he was, he asked for pirated copies of his own movies. When it turned out there were plenty of them for sale he started yelling at the owners, saying they were stealing his stuff.
 So they invited him for tea. They said they were so honored to have him in the store, even though he was yelling at them.
 Did they say they would stop selling pirated copies?
 Of course not. There was no way they were not going to do that. They said they were selling loads and loads of his films, that he was hugely popular, and he should consider it a compliment.
 You grew up near what's now Diversity Plaza?
 On 83rd Street and 37th Avenue, so about a 10-minute walk away and also 10 minutes from Sam and Raj. When my family and I came to America we were told that there were three monuments in New York that every Indian must visit: the Empire State Building, the Statue of Liberty and Sam and Raj, an electrical appliance shop on 74th Street and 37th Avenue, where you could buy both 110- and 220-volt appliances.
 Sam and Raj also sold toasters, razors, watches and little pens with digital alarm clocks embedded in them -- things Indians would take back home. If you spoke in Gujarati, they wouldn't charge you sales tax. Every time someone in my family came from India to visit, we had to take them to the fabled Sam and Raj. From the old country they would bring over a cargo of rich silks and exotic spices.
 And they would take back, you know, bags filled with cheap electronic knickknacks.
 Nearby I remember there was a Burmese grocery store called Mount Fuji (because the owners had lived in Japan). Big freezers contained Burmese river fish and tea leaf salads. Burmese hip-hop played on the TV. This was when Myanmar was under sanctions, so the store had to smuggle everything in from Burma. Burmese people living in Jackson Heights would make trips home and smuggle goods back. Once, I asked a couple of guys in the store what these people would take from Queens to Burma. They said the same thing: ''Centrum!''
 Apparently Centrum multivitamins were much in vogue in Burma.
 Jackson Heights was originally a private development scheme -- a kind of City Beautiful with faux French Renaissance and Tudor housing built by the Queensboro Corporation to lure white Manhattanites, but then Jews and L.G.B.T.Q. New Yorkers started arriving by the 1940s, Latinos in the '50s.
 The Queensboro Corporation named it after a descendant of one of the original Queens families and added ''heights'' because it made the place sound loftier.
 Those Latinos who started arriving in the 1950s were mostly Colombians and other South Americans. Today they're also from Central and North America. After the 1965 Immigration Act lifted restrictions on Asians, waves of Indian professionals, like my parents, started coming.
 You didn't turn out to be suited to the family trade.
 No, but I did end up writing what I believe is still the only Jain-Hasidic love story set in the diamond business. It was made into a movie some years ago by Mira Nair, part of a not particularly distinguished omnibus film called ''New York, I Love You.'' My segment was ''Kosher Vegetarian,'' starring Natalie Portman and the late, great Indian actor Irrfan Khan. Their love talk was: ''What can't you eat?''
 Speaking of cultural mash-ups, just around the corner from Diversity Plaza, if we stand at the bottom of the stairs leading to and from the elevated No. 7 train on Roosevelt at 74th and do a panoramic survey, we can find signs in Spanish, Bengali, Urdu and Hindi. The most interesting signage tends to be on the second floors.
 Facing onto the elevated subway tracks?
 Right. Those second floors are rabbit warrens of shops and offices. The multilingual signs in the windows advertise businesses that help people in the neighborhood deal with green cards, civil-service exams, driver's licenses, divorces, funerals and SAT prep. In Jackson Heights recent immigrants don't always know how to interface with the American system or whom to trust, so when they find a person, someone in one of these places, they'll often use that person to handle everything.
 Then if we walk down Roosevelt Avenue, we come to some of the famous Latino bars like ''Romanticos,'' which are what used to be called taxi dance halls.
 Henry Miller wrote about taxi dance halls in the 1920s.
 They flourish in Jackson Heights as ''bailaderos'' -- places men can go to have a beer in the presence of somewhat skimpily dressed women and pay a couple of dollars extra for a dance. Like the men, the women are mostly migrants, from all over Latin America. I've gone to these bars. Typically, a guy comes in, a woman comes up to him, she's dressed in a short skirt, they start chatting. Soon they bring out their phones to show pictures of their families back in the Dominican Republic or Mexico and coo over each other's kids before they get up to grind on the dance floor. For a few dollars, their loneliness may be briefly assuaged.
 There's an L.G.B.T.Q. bar scene on Roosevelt Avenue, as well.
 The city's biggest concentration of Latino L.G.B.T.Q. bars and nightclubs is in Jackson Heights. As far back as the 1920s, gays from Manhattan started coming to the neighborhood, and now Jackson Heights hosts the city's second-biggest Pride parade -- an amazing thing considering this is home to some of the city's most conservative religious communities, like Bangladeshi Muslims and Latino Catholics.
 I grew up among these people. My parents sent me to an all-boys Catholic school. The teachers called me a pagan and I learned to run very fast.
 There was a notorious hate crime in Jackson Heights back in 1990. Julio Rivera, a 29-year-old gay bartender, was lured to a public schoolyard, beaten and stabbed to death by skinheads.
 The corner of 78th Street and 37th Avenue is now named after Rivera. My younger sister went to that public school, P.S. 69. That this neighborhood should end up hosting the city's second-biggest Pride parade seemed impossible back then. But I think because Jackson Heights is so ethnically diverse, people have gradually become accustomed to accommodating what you might call another spice in the mix, ethnically and sexually.
 Diversity breeds tolerance.
 I don't like the word tolerance because it implies sufferance. I prefer to describe it as a lowering of people's guards at a time when the neighborhood and the city in general have become safer, which means there is less fear and more room for curiosity.
 But it's also a product of sharing the same space. I like to use the example of the building where I grew up, at 35-33 83rd Street. When I lived there -- and the situation is no different now -- the owner was Turkish. The super was Greek, the tenants were Indians and Pakistanis, Dominicans and Puerto Ricans, Muslims, Uzbeks and former Soviet Jews. People who had been killing each other just before they got on the plane for America were living next to each other. And every Sunday morning, the entire building rang to the glad sounds of Bollywood songs on ''Vision of Asia,'' which was a program broadcast on a Spanish-language television station. Dominicans, Indians, Pakistanis and Russians in the building all sang along.
 Don't get me wrong. It wasn't that we were all one big happy family and loved each other in our colorful eccentricities. We often said horribly racist things about each other.
 But we were all immigrants trying to make a life in the New World, some of us sending money back to the most hateful organizations in our home countries. But here we shared food, because Hindus and Muslims both like samosas. Here, hate crime laws, as extremists learned, were enforced much more than they were back home, so fear of the law mitigated some of the worst impulses.
 And children played together on the street, or in each other's backyards, which meant parents got to know about all these other cultures through their kids. My sister's best friend was the Greek super's daughter, which is how we learned about pork chops seasoned with oregano, and how they learned about Gujarati vegetarian food like dhoklas.
 You mentioned sending money home, the remittance economy.
 Jackson Heights is of course home to a large number of undocumented residents. There seems to be tacit understanding that civil authorities won't enforce certain rules and codes too strictly. Informality allows the system to be permeable, meaning that someone who lives here may not need to produce a Social Security card to rent an apartment or get a job. They can earn enough to pay the rent and also send money home. So along Roosevelt Avenue there are all sorts of stores that cater to the remittance economy. Last year, migrants around the world sent over $554 billion home.
 More than three times the amount of development aid dispensed by wealthy countries, according to the World Bank, although the pandemic threatens to reduce remittances significantly, with scary ripple effects on global poverty.
 Remittances may be tiny -- $50, $100 -- but the money goes directly to the grandmother for medical treatment or the sister who needs to pay her school fees. It bypasses governments and government corruption. If we really want to help the global poor, I think we need more money transfer places like the ones on Roosevelt Avenue.
 Roosevelt Avenue isn't the official commercial drag of the neighborhood.
 No, that's 37th Avenue, a block north, where you will find the ''sidewalk ballet'' that Jane Jacobs celebrated, with mom and pop stores where the mom and the pop are actually outside, standing on the street, watching kids play.
 The avenue is an incredibly lively, vibrant scene -- not messy and seedy like Roosevelt Avenue -- with everything from Korean grocers and gourmet cheese and wine shops for the yuppies who are gentrifying Jackson Heights to Brazilian and Colombian boutiques selling jeans and lingerie with fake bundas.
 Fake what?
 Bundas. Padded butts. And then you have the discount suits on display at the old-time men's wear stores, which in my day sold outfits you might recall from ''Saturday Night Fever.'' When I was a student at N.Y.U., my father took me to one. I had told him I was going on my first date. He kind of stared at me, then took me to one of these stores and very loudly announced to the salesman: ''My son has an important social occasion coming up.'' He bought me a three-piece suit.
 How lovely.
 It was highly flamboyant, with a heavy polyester component.
 How did the date go?
 She was a Dominican woman from Brooklyn. I fell madly in love. We saw a Broadway show and she somehow managed to suppress her laughter at the sight of a skinny little Indian from Jackson Heights in a three-piece polyester suit.
 You mentioned the G word earlier. Increasingly, the neighborhood has attracted young bankers and tech workers who like having the ability to choose between pupusas and parathas for dinner.
 As Amanda Burden, the city's former planning commissioner, likes to say, gentrification is like cholesterol: There's good gentrification and bad gentrification. For Jackson Heights, it's a good thing that there is diversity of income as well as of ethnicity. But big garden apartments that used to sell for $300,000 now cost closer to $1 million, which has had the effect of forcing more and more immigrants into basement apartments.
 We'll get to the basement apartments. The garden apartments first. You're talking about ones the Queensboro Corporation built to entice middle-class Manhattanites.
 Right -- places like the Chateau on 81st Street. My younger sister's best friend lived there. It's in what is now the neighborhood's designated historic district, which includes some of the loveliest housing in all five boroughs, constructed mostly between the 1910s and the 1950s. The buildings have pretty slate roofs and all kinds of architectural details, with blocklong interior gardens that you can't see from the street, which was the point. They're private gardens. At the Chateau, the garden was designed by the Olmsted brothers, I believe.
 And gentrification is producing new developments like Roosevelt Parc.
 A residential tower, around the corner from Diversity Plaza, by Marvel Architects.
 With rooftop lounges, a movie room and a yoga lawn that rent for thousands of dollars a month. In Jackson Heights, the issue around gentrification isn't just the rent. It's the fact that a potential tenant at a place like Roosevelt Parc needs to produce all kinds of documents to apply for an apartment. That kind of documentation, even if you're legal, can be very difficult for new immigrants who haven't built up credit histories or developed references.
 So rising rents and other obstacles push more people into basement apartments.
 Yes. The garden apartments are on the north side of 37th Avenue. We can see basement apartments on the south side. These are mostly pleasant, suburban-looking streets with neat two-story frame houses -- you wouldn't know that dozens of people live in the basements unless you notice the number of mailboxes and satellite dishes. Sometimes you can guess who lives there. I don't know why but Trinidadians and Guyanese seem to prefer white steel gates.
 Inside, the rooms are all occupied by different people, and the basement might have hot beds, meaning cubicles where people share the same bed in shifts. I've been in many of these basements. There's a perception they're fire traps, and some are, but usually, with just a few fixes, they could be brought up to code.
 The city certainly needs more affordable housing. But even if landlords spent the money to upgrade them, New York, unlike, say, San Francisco or Seattle or Los Angeles, doesn't seem anxious to legalize lots more ''alternative dwellings,'' as they're called.
 The city has fallen behind the curve. I think landlords would spend the money. Most of the landlords are immigrants themselves who would have a much easier time getting mortgages if they were able to show that the rents from these basements were legitimate income.
 How do you think the pandemic will change things?
 It's an open question whether gentrifiers will continue moving into the neighborhood or whether they'll now prefer to leave the city for places like Hudson, N.Y. But the taxi drivers and delivery guys who share the basement cubicles don't have the luxury of teleworking. So they're not going anywhere.
 And where are we going next?
 A block from The Chateau, I wanted to point out Community United Methodist Church. There's a street sign at the corner commemorating the invention of Scrabble, which was first played in the church in 1938. It was the invention of a Jackson Heights resident (an unemployed architect) named Alfred Butts. Legions of Scrabble devotees now make pilgrimages to the church, which you will notice also advertises services in Punjabi, Urdu, Bahasa, Korean, Chinese and Spanish. I love that God is worshiped in so many languages in the house where Scrabble was invented. Brooklyn may be known as the Borough of Churches. But Jackson Heights is where, for example, the Jewish Center, on 77th Street, also hosts Pentecostal services, Hindu services and the annual Iftar celebration of Bangladeshi and other Muslims.
 That's rather beautiful.
 Look, architecturally speaking, the neighborhood is not Versailles. There are some really unlovely buildings and shabby dwellings in Jackson Heights. But, for me, the area comes down to its people and their stories --- and to the surprise and joy you feel walking down a street like 37th Avenue and seeing all the Bangladeshi and Dominican knickknack shops and children's toys spilling onto the sidewalk, and the people selling sugar cane juice. The neighborhood is an incredibly hospitable place, where a person can come from anywhere, doesn't necessarily need papers, might have to start at the bottom -- literally, in the basement -- but can gain a foothold in America.
 The American dream.
 Speaking of which, I thought we might end at a wonderful ice cream store, founded in 1897, Jahn's, which I used to go to with my family. The signature dish is the Kitchen Sink Sundae for eight.
 I've seen a video of that sundae on YouTube. It's the size of a punch bowl. Is that what your family ordered?
 Of course, not long after we arrived. And that's when we realized: This is the promise of the New World. We have found it. It's the Kitchen Sink Sundae for eight.

And just because it happens digitally doesn't mean it should be taken less seriously. Hate should never be normalized.
On May 1, 2017--the day after I was sworn in as President--a masked perpetrator hung bananas from black corded nooses from light posts and bus stops around campus. The bananas were labeled with ""AKA"" and ""AKA FREE,"" referencing Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated (AKA) the predominately Black sorority of which I am a member, and ""HARAMBE BAIT"" referencing the gorilla that was killed at the Cincinnati Zoo in 2016. As this vile act gained national attention and was investigated by the Department of Justice as a hate crime, my story must have come to Andrew Anglin's attention.
By May 4, 2017, Anglin took it upon himself to incite a coordinated cyber-harassment campaign to encourage his followers to ""send me some words of support"" by doxing me. In other words, Anglin and many in his army of followers posted my personal information online with the intent that the information be used to harass, stalk, and threaten me, and be used against me for an unlawful purpose.
He and others provided their followers with the direct link to my Facebook page and Twitter page with calls to action. Due to his notoriety amongst the white supremacist community, Anglin's followers heeded his call to action and began to inundate my social media accounts, chatrooms, and the dark-net with racist and sexist threats and comments. This ""troll storm"" was unrelenting and went on for months. This took place on various social media platforms, websites, and chatrooms. In essence, any time my name or story was--or is--mentioned, white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and their sympathizers leave comments voicing their discontent, hate, and thinly veiled threats.
What I experienced following the May 1st hate crime was not ""just some mean words from some mean people,"" but was a part of a larger coordinated effort incited by a world-renowned neo-Nazi leader to intimidate, threaten, and harass me online. I was scared for my physical safety as bananas were already hung from nooses on my campus and was afraid that the white supremacists and neo-Nazis would act on their statements. I did not know what acts of violence Daily Stormer users were capable of doing, but I knew that this troll storm was not the first time that its users acted offline on their threats espoused online. There are reports that Dylann Roof posted on the Daily Stormer's website prior to committing the Emanuel AME Church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina. I was incredibly frightened to know the same website was targeting me.
As a result of this experience, I was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, and lost 15 percent of my body weight. Still today, more than three years later, I experience flashbacks and triggers, and am forced to take increased measures to protect myself and my family. The online hate and harassment forced me to change my daily routine, install video cameras at my house, drastically decrease my social media use, stop tagging my location in posts online, and even take self-defense classes.
Like most millennials, social media was the way that I kept in touch with friends and family, accessed the news, and stayed up to date with grassroots movements in my community. However, after the events of May 1 and May 4, I became extremely isolated and withdrawn as my ability to express myself was significantly limited due to the safety risks posed by my engagement online.
To be clear, these are not just flashbacks and triggers: the harassment Anglin and his followers incited on various social media platforms against me continues to this day. I continue to receive threatening and harassing messages three years after Anglin initiated his troll storm. Below you can find images and text of some of the threatening, racist, and sexist comments directed at me on social media platforms within the last few years.
This is why I sued Andrew Anglin, the Daily Stormer's parent company, and two other defendants in federal court for violating the District of Columbia's Human Rights Act, which prohibits individuals from interfering with someone's use of a public accommodation, with pro bono representation by the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, the Washington Lawyers' Committee, and Kirkland and Ellis, LLP.
In Dumpson v. Ade, Judge Rosemary Collyer of the United States District Court of the District of Columbia set precedent by ruling that racist online harassment can interfere with an individual's equal access to a public accommodation, as I had to make significant changes to how I navigated on a day-to-day basis. Further, Judge Collier found that ""a causal nexus exists between the troll storm created by [Andrew] Anglin... and [my] enjoyment of [American University] ...and that [I] was targeted because of my race and gender.""
Extremist Use of Social Media in Radicalizing America
Unfortunately, my personal experience as a victim of online hate and harassment is not unique or even infrequent. Social media platforms such as Facebook have allowed the worst and most heinous elements of society into my home and my life, and into yours too. It's created an open door to the kinds of people you would never allow anywhere near your loved ones in the physical world. All too often people say that what happens online ""isn't real."" Let me be clear, what happens online is very real--and the line between virtual and physical has become indistinguishable.
Over the last several years, extremists like Anglin's Daily Stormer followers have been empowered by access to the online world. The internet amplifies hateful voices to reach millions around the world. It does not take an expert to see the ways social media has become a universal tool for extremist movements to organize and engage in violence.
Social media also offers a virtual community for like-minded hatemongering individuals and groups. Online forums allow isolated white supremacists and extremists to become more active and involved in virtual campaigns of ideological recruitment and radicalization. Individuals can easily find sanction, support, and reinforcement online for their extreme beliefs or actions because the internet offers a reading and viewing library of tens of thousands of pieces of content.
The internet also allows hate to spread faster and wider than it ever has before. A meme that is generated by a dedicated antisemite on a toxic platform like Gab, 8kun, 4chan or messenger services used by extremists, like Telegram, can be disseminated almost instantaneously on more mainstream social media sites like Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, or Reddit.
Once on mainstream social media sites, these hate messages, incitement and violent threats often spread faster than content moderators can catch--or, in the case of Facebook and Holocaust denial, are willing to remove. Podcasting and video sharing sites like YouTube allow white supremacists, extremists and antisemites to broadcast their hateful ideology and speak directly to users. The hateful content is ""recommended"" to some users because social media algorithms are trained to optimize and increase user engagement. So, the most problematic content on these sites is actually recommended and amplified by the social media companies themselves.
The hate crimes and incidents I experienced in May of 2017 were not the first and far from the last time social media has been used to perpetuate white supremacy and extremism. Three months after nationalizing the online attacks against me, in August 2017, Anglin used Facebook to co-organize the white supremacist ""Unite the Right"" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, which attracted some 600 extremists from around the country and ended in deadly violence. Members of the so-called alt right descended on the small college city and clashed with counter-demonstrators, leading to scores of injuries and the death of counter-protester Heather Heyer.
Impact of Hate Online
This year in particular has seen a tectonic shift in the way communities across the world integrate digital and social networks into their daily lives. Online hate and harassment were pervasive issues long before the COVID-19 pandemic, but against the backdrop of quarantine and virtual work, school, worship and social lives, this phenomenon is more pervasive than ever. The Asian, Jewish, Muslim, Latinx and immigrant communities in particular are experiencing an onslaught of targeted hate, fueled by conspiracy theories, bigotry, and racism surrounding the novel coronavirus. Also, the social justice reckoning protesting police brutality in the wake of George Floyd's murder has spurred even more dehumanizing anti-Black racism and prejudice across social media platforms.
According to a 2020 national ADL survey (ADL's 2020 Online Hate survey), 44 percent of Americans experienced online harassment and 28 percent experienced severe online harassment--including stalking, physical threats, swatting, doxing and sustained harassment.
It does not surprise me that ADL's research also shows that targeting based on specific identity-characteristics is on the rise. The 2020 statistics show race-based harassment affected 55 percent of Asian-Americans and 42 percent of Hispanic and African-American respondents. Women also experienced harassment disproportionately, as 37 percent of female-identified respondents felt they were targeted because of their gender. Sixty-one percent of Muslim Americans who reported experiencing online harassment felt they were targeted because of their religion and 43 percent of Jewish Americans felt they were targeted with hateful content because of their religion. Forty-eight percent of LGBTQ+ respondents reported harassment based on their sexual orientation.
Online harassment impacts targets in a variety of ways. The most common response is to stop, reduce or change online behavior, which 36 percent of those who have been harassed have done. This can include steps like posting less often, avoiding certain sites, changing privacy settings, deleting apps, or increasing filtering of content or users. Many go further, with 18 percent of harassment targets contacting the technology platform to ask for help or report harassing content. In some cases, these behaviors were coupled with other consequences including thoughts of depression and suicide, anxiety, and economic impact.
I know I'm not alone in the call for change. According to ADL's 2020 Online Hate survey, Americans overwhelmingly want to see concrete steps taken to address online hate and harassment. Across political ideologies, the vast majority of Americans believe that social media companies and the government need to take action against online hate and harassment. In fact, 87.5 percent of Americans somewhat or strongly agree that the government should strengthen laws and improve training and resources for police on online hate and harassment. Americans also want platforms to take more action to counter or mitigate the problem. Seventy-seven percent of Americans want companies to make it easier to report hateful content and behavior.
Big Tech is Apathetic to the Problem
In the months and years that followed the May 1 and May 4 events, I faced hurdles and struggled to regain my sense of normalcy. My PTSD is triggered each time white supremacists' attacks or anti-black racism makes its way to the news cycle. I still struggle to sleep and often have invasive thoughts about the hate crimes I experienced. And these experiences also had lingering impacts on my family and friends' mental health.
Weeks ago, Facebook was, yet again, apathetic to racism and incitement to violence. The call to arms event that resulted in the Kenosha shooting was flagged over 450 times, but Facebook did nothing. This inaction reminded me of the Orlando Pulse Nightclub attack--where the gunman allegedly used multiple Facebook accounts to search about the Islamic State and other terrorist groups before the attack and also used the site after to see if his attack went viral. n1
This inaction reminded me of social media's role in the deadly 2017 Charlottesville ""Unite the Right Rally,"" which was organized by my attacker on Facebook and the event page was up for a month, only taken down the day before the event. n2 It reminded me of the horrors of the New Zealand mosque shootings, livestreamed on Facebook and still hosted on the platform six months later. n3 It reminded me of Pittsburgh, El Paso, Poway, and too many other violent (and often fatal) hate crimes in which Facebook (and Big Tech) played a central role.
In ADL's 2020 Online Hate survey, 42 percent of daily Facebook users experienced harassment on the platform. Of those respondents who were harassed online, like I was, more than three-quarters (77%) reported that at least some of their harassment occurred on Facebook. It is a hotbed of hate and an all-too-easy platform to harass and terrorize targets. Below are just a couple images the Stop Hate for Profit Coalition recently shared with supporters. These images were found on Facebook in August and September 2020.
Stop Hate for Profit
In response to social media's repeated failure to meaningfully address the vast proliferation of hate on their platforms--and Facebook's particular role in this proliferation, ADL, Color of Change, Common Sense, Free Press, LULAC, Mozilla, NAACP, National Hispanic Media Center, and Sleeping Giants launched a campaign called Stop Hate for Profit. In July, the campaign called on advertisers to engage in a one-month ad pause. In September, just last week, the campaign called on A-List influencers to freeze their Instagram accounts and highlight Facebook's inaction toward electoral misinformation, hate, violence and racism.
I strongly support the Stop Hate for Profit campaign. I know what it is like to be the target of daily racist and misogynist posts, to receive threats online, and to be the subject of extremist group chats. Their request for Facebook (and the rest of Big Tech) to increase accountability, decency and victim support on the platform resonates with me both as an advocate and as a survivor (and enduring target) of online abuse. And I find comfort in knowing that thousands of major businesses including Volkswagen, Unilever, Verizon, Walgreens, KIND, Pfizer, Colgate-Palmolive, Williams Sonoma Inc., North Face and Patagonia joined in an ad pause to call on Facebook to address rampant hate, racism and disinformation on its platforms. On the other hand, it's disheartening that Mr. Zuckerberg immediately dismissed this campaign, insisting that advertisers will be back on the platform ""soon enough."" I understand that this is because Facebook's vast user base and reach provides a captive audience for advertisers to micro-target and engage.
Not surprisingly, when it comes to dealing with rampant hate and harassment, the platform continues to come up short--responding with PR moves at best, and apathy more often. When will enough be enough? What are they doing with $70 billion in revenue and $17 billion in profit? Their hate speech, incitement, and misinformation policies are inequitable. Their harassment victim services are inadequate. Their advertising placement's proximity to hateful content is haphazard. And their ""civil rights"" audit transparency reports aren't helpful to the civil rights community.
Backspace Hate
As our online lives have become even more central to the way we work, communicate and socialize in this unprecedented time, it's also gotten easier than ever before for individuals to harm their targets online. I speak from personal experience. I know what it is like to have every aspect of my life invaded with racist, misogynist comments, threats and images. I know what it is like to be the target of cyberstalking and doxing--it is something no person should have to experience. But, if they do, our government needs to support the targets of these crimes and hold perpetrators accountable.
But do not take my word for it. As I mentioned above, ADL's 2020 Online Hate survey found that 28 percent of Americans experienced severe online harassment, including sexual harassment, stalking, physical threats, or sustained harassment. ADL has also done deep ethnographic research and found that individuals who were the targets of intense harassment campaigns experienced significant emotional and economic burdens. In response to these trends, over 85 percent of Americans want policymakers to strengthen laws to prevent such acts.
I'm a big supporter of ADL's ""Backspace Hate,"" a national initiative to fight the escalating problems of harmful online activities, including cyber harassment, cyber stalking, swatting, and doxing, through updating legislation and raising awareness. Doxing is one form of online harassment that does not have adequate legal protections for targets at the state or federal level. These are tactics extremists have used to harass and terrorize targets. Swatting is the false reporting of an emergency with the goal of having a police unit or emergency response team deployed to a dwelling. It has been increasingly used as a digital harassment tactic and has resulted in injuries and trauma (and even a fatality) to both targets and unintended victims.
The prevalence of these problems is only increasing. In fact, in January 2020, one individual who was sympathetic to neo-Nazi ideology and loosely associated with the neo-Nazi group, the Atomwaffen Division (AWD), was caught after having worked with others from Canada and England to target people in a series of multi-national swatting and doxing incidents. According to ADL's Center on Extremism, cyber-harassment has been at the forefront of AWD tactics since the group's inception in 2016.
Shockingly, there are no protections for doxing or swatting at the federal level. And, in far too many states common digital tactics harassers use to harm their targets are not considered unlawful. I was able to sue my online tormentors, but my lawyers should not have had to find a novel legal theory and a DC-specific law to bring my case to court. What I experienced was hate crime after hate crime. I sued Andrew Anglin, The Daily Stormer, and two other individuals--this did not account for the thousands of people threatening my life online daily.
As part of ADL's Backspace Hate effort, several states are pursuing bipartisan legislation that address severe online harassment by holding perpetrators accountable for their actions online. For example, this past legislative session, Washington State showed tremendous leadership in enacting anti-swatting legislation protecting targets and victims from the serious and potentially fatal consequences of this digital abuse. Washington's law makes swatting a felony when it results in someone being injured or killed. The legislation also gives swatting victims and targets the right to sue and allows law enforcement or a city to seek damages. While some states have anti-swatting laws, too many do not.
In addition to advocating for specific legislation, ADL is harnessing its resources and expertise by raising awareness among policymakers, law enforcement, and supporters; building coalitions with diverse partners; gathering petition signatures to deliver to legislators; publishing research on these issues and their effects on targets; and providing recommendations for technical solutions.
Hate Crimes
While I have focused mostly on the cyber harassment components of my experience, let me end where this started: a hate crime investigated by the Justice Department. Unfortunately, it is unusual that the hate crime against me was reported. It was the American University public safety department that made the intial report--not me. Often, victims of hate crimes do not come forward to report their experiences because they either do not trust the police, believe the police are unwilling to act, or have reason to believe they are unable to respond effectively to a hate crime. For example, I reported the cyber-harassment itself to the Metropolitan Police Department, but never heard back. That's why law enforcement's role in responding to and reporting incidents, both online and on the ground, is so important.
While I was afraid of being physically attacked on campus and at home, many Americans are afraid that they will be attacked in their house of worship, their supermarket, or walking down the street. 2018 saw the highest number of hate crime murders on record, with 24 victims. n4 The second highest year for hate crime murders was 2000, with 19 victims. n5
While FBI statistics are essential, we know they are incomplete. 16,039 law enforcement agencies in the United States participated in the 2018 data collection effort--the second highest level of participation since the enactment of the HCSA in 1990, but a slight decrease from 2017 record participation of 16,149. Importantly, only 2,028 of these agencies, less than 13 percent, reported one or more hate crimes to the FBI. That means that 87 percent of all participating police agencies affirmatively reported zero (0) hate crimes to the FBI (including at least 77 cities over 100,000). And eight more law enforcement agencies over 100,000 did not report any data to the FBI. According to anti-hate groups like ADL, that specialize in understanding hate crimes and advocating for more protections for targets, reports of zero hate crimes are simply not credible. These reports suggest that the number of hate crimes in America is far greater than what is reported.
It's been brought to my attention that the federal government has an essential leadership role to play in confronting hate crimes and in alleviating intolerance. The most effective response is to explicitly call out bigotry whenever and wherever it happens, and to strengthen federal hate crime prevention and response.
I am hopeful about the enactment of hate crimes laws. This is a matter with bipartisan support, as demonstrated in Georgia, which in June passed a comprehensive and inclusive hate crime law and joined the 45 other states with hate crimes laws on the books. I was heartened to learn that Governor Brian Kemp signed into law House Bill 426, the ""Georgia Enhanced Penalties for Hate Crimes Act,"" with protections that go into effect immediately.
ADL leads the Hate Free Georgia Coalition, which played an important role in securing the passage of HB 426. HB 426 provides stronger penalties for individuals who target victims because of their actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender, mental disability, or physical disability. It also requires local law enforcement agencies to collect data on hate crime investigations and provide ""Bias Crime Reports"" to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, which is essential for effective enforcement of the law. This was a critical step towards addressing systemic racial injustice in that state. Still, there is more to do. There are states without adequate hate crime protections and hate crimes going uninvestigated or unreported. We need the full picture.
Policy Recommendations
In partnership with ADL, I want to share the following measures that, taken together, can immediately help combat the rise in physical and online hate crimes, as well as hate incidents in general:
1. Use the Bully Pulpit to Fight Hate: Words have power
o Speak up and call out racism and bigotry at every opportunity. The right to free speech is a core value, but the promotion of hate should be vehemently and consistently rejected. Often, people will say that the answer to extremism and hate speech is more speech. That premise is inherently flawed because it assumes incorrectly that more speech would be counter-speech, not simply be more hate speech. While at one time that argument might have been persuasive, during my lifetime--in the digital age--the hateful voices too often just drown out the others.
o In this environment, the importance of ensuring that the fight against extremists not be politicized--all the more so close to the election--cannot be overstated.
2. Improve Federal Hate Crime Data Collection, Transparency and Support
o The Department of Justice should incentivize and encourage state and local law enforcement agencies to more comprehensively collect and report hate crimes to the FBI, with special attention devoted to large underreporting by law enforcement agencies that either have not participated in the FBI Hate Crime Statistics Act program at all or have affirmatively and not credibly reported zero hate crimes. More comprehensive, complete hate crime reporting--including reporting online hate crimes--can deter hate violence.
o The federal government should provide funding for criminal investigations and prosecutions by state, local and tribal law enforcement officials, as authorized by Section 4704 of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009.
3. Pass Legislation to Fight Hate
o Pass H.R. 1931, the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act: This legislation would enhance the federal government's efforts to prevent domestic terrorism by authorizing into law the offices addressing domestic terrorism and requiring federal law enforcement agencies to regularly assess those threats and then deploy resource to the threats. The bill would also provide training and resources to assist non-federal law enforcement, requiring DOJ, DHS, and the FBI to provide training and resources to assist state, local, and tribal law enforcement in understanding, detecting, investigating, and deterring acts of domestic terrorism.
o Pass H.R. 3545, the Khalid Jabara and Heather Heyer National Opposition to Hate, Assault, and Threats to Equality (NO HATE) Act of 2019, which would authorize incentive grants to encourage improved local and state hate crime training, prevention, best practices, and data collection initiatives--including grants for state hate crime reporting hotlines to direct individuals to local law enforcement and support services.
4. Support More Anti-Bias Education and Training
o Recognizing that hate cannot be legislated or regulated out of existence, Congress should provide increased funding for inclusive school anti-bias education, civics education, and bullying prevention programs.
5. Address Online Hate and Harassment Through Legislation and Training
o Review the tools and services platforms provide to targets: Targets like myself rely on platforms to provide tools and services to report the online hate and harassment I regularly receive. I can tell you from personal experience, it isn't enough. Congress should commission research that provides a summary of the available mechanisms provided by platforms to their users to protect and defend themselves. The review process should also include a needs assessment of users and a gap analysis of available tools and services.
o Strengthen laws against perpetrators of online hate: Hate and harassment exist both on the ground and online spaces, but our laws aren't doing enough. Many forms of severe online misconduct are not consistently or adequately covered by our current cybercrime, harassment, stalking and hate crime laws. State and federal lawmakers have an opportunity to lead the fight against online hate and harassment by increasing protections for targets as well as penalties for perpetrators of severe and abusive online misconduct.
. In July 2017, in the 115th Congress, Representative Katherine Clark introduced and lead H.R. 3067, the Online Safety Modernization Act, which, among other things, would have provided federal protections against doxing and swatting. We desperately need these protections.
o Improve training of law enforcement: Though the physical threat I experienced was classified as a hate crime, the online hate and harassment that terrorized me was not. Law enforcement should be a key responder to online hate and harassment, especially in cases like mine that involve direct threats. I know these cases are complicated but that is not an excuse. We must increase training and resources for agencies to ensure law enforcement personnel can better support targets. Additionally, law enforcement training on stalking, harassment, and threats should be modernized to reflect the role the internet plays in the 21st Century. Too often, local law enforcement agencies are not adequately equipped with technology or personnel to address the nuance in this area. Better training and resources can support better and more effective investigations and prosecutions.
. The Department of Justice should also incentivize and encourage state and local law enforcement agencies to specifically incorporate cultural competency and trauma-informed trainings into their hate crime response trainings, as far too often survivors and targets of hate crimes are uncomfortable with reporting their experiences to members of law enforcement for fear of retraumatization. Though I reported some of the most egregious instances of hate directed at me to law enforcement, the vast majority of times I did not because of my experiences with law enforcement officers failing to act with cross-cultural awareness and empathy.
6. Urge Social Media Platforms to Institute Stronger Means to Measure and Address Online Hate and Harassment
o Strengthen and Adequately Enforce Policies Against Hate: Social media platforms should have better community guidelines or standards that comprehensively address hateful content and harassing behavior, and clearly define consequences for violations. Platforms should prohibit toxic content from being monetized to ensure their platform cannot be used to fund extremist individuals, groups and movements. Social media platforms also need to invest in enforcement. Platforms need to use a mix of human reviewers, AI, and an appeals process that all work together to enforce their policies. Social media platforms owe their consumers an equal opportunity to engage in the digital space irrespective of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or other identity-based characteristics. However, platforms fail to satisfy that obligation when they prioritize the speech rights of extremists to that of marginalized communities, who are silenced when platforms amplify hate.
o Expand tools and services for targets: Given the prevalence of online hate and harassment, platforms should offer far more services and tools for individuals facing or fearing online attack. Targets should be allowed to flag multiple pieces of content, or even an entire thread, within one report instead of having to create a new report for each piece of content being flagged. I am now used to reviewing, filtering, identifying, screenshotting, and saving multiple threatening and harassing comments on a monthly basis, in the event that the comments rise to the level of a ""true threat,"" specifying time, place, and manner of attack--but I should not have to be. And even when I have used the reporting mechanisms provided on various social media platforms, the platforms have either failed to remove the content.
o Alternatively, I have also received messages that platforms have decided to keep up the abusive content I have reported because it allegedly does not violate their community standards. The messages I have received that have remained up are personally violating and it is unfathomable how they would not violate community standards. I should be able to trust that social media platforms will regulate the content posted on their sites and prevent their platforms from being used to by extremists to mobilize and act on hate. The arduous process of capturing images of violating content and reporting can and should be improved. The burden of bringing hate and extremism to the attention of social media platforms should not be on the victims and targets.
o Increase accountability and transparency: Platforms need a better civil rights infrastructure. They should be subject to external, independent audits. Right now, the only people who truly know the extent of hate and harassment on platforms are targets, perpetrators and the platforms themselves. I was encouraged to learn that Consumer Protection and Commerce Subcommittee Chair Jan Schakowsky along with other Energy and Commerce Committee leadership voiced concerns about the newly launched Facebook Oversight Board, because of the lack of power it has to actually drive the necessary accountability and transparency measures necessary to decrease hate and extremism on social media. The public needs to know about the extent of hate, extremism and harassment on a given platform. Audits would also allow the public to verify that the company is following through on its promises. Transparency reports should include data from user generated identity-based reporting.
Conclusion
Thank you for calling this important hearing and for the opportunity to submit this testimony. ADL data clearly indicates that my personal experience is unfortunately not unique, that hate is rising across America and that crimes like doxing and swatting pose a significant threat to our communities. Everyday Americans are subjected to hate online but, too often we are told that because these comments and threats were made on social media platforms little can be done to regulate these actions and prevent them from happing in the future. But a lot more can be done, and Congress must be a part of the efforts to de-radicalize social media.
This is a time for leaders to lead. I urge you to speak out about the threat, legislate against it and encourage social media companies to address online hate in their platforms, so we can prevent future hate crimes and protect targets like me.

72,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_751/Files (250).DOCX","Targeted News Service",2020-08-06,"2809 words",NA,"Targeted News Service",NA,"Va. A.G. Herring Calls on Facebook to Take Stronger Steps to Prevent Use of Its Platforms to Spread Hate and Disinformation",FALSE,"Virginia Attorney General Mark R. Herring issued the following news release on Aug. 5:
Attorney General Mark R. Herring today joined 19 attorneys general from across the United States in calling on Facebook to take additional steps to prevent the popular social media website from being used to spread hate and disinformation. Attorney General Herring and his colleagues also urged Facebook to provide stronger support for users who fall victim to online intimidation and harassment on its platforms.
In a letter sent today to Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, Attorney General Herring and his colleagues assert that despite its stated commitment to working to keep its user community safe, Facebook has fallen short in keeping hate content off its platforms and protecting users from online harassment.
""Unfortunately, over the past few years, we have seen how Facebook can be used as a tool to spread misinformation and hate that can have serious, real-life consequences,"" said Attorney General Herring. ""Especially now, when our country finds itself in a moment of tremendous social change and with an incredibly important presidential election in just a few months, Facebook must take stronger steps to further protect its users from hate and prevent its platform from being used to spread disinformation.""
The coalition's letter highlights that the nation is presently in a moment of reckoning on issues of racial justice and civil rights. Against this backdrop, the letter states that ""[p]rivate parties, organized groups and public officials continue to use Facebook to spread misinformation and project messages of hate against different groups of Americans,"" with many of those messages leading to the abuse of individual Facebook users.
The letter follows the release of a Civil Rights Audit of Facebook's practices - commissioned by the company and completed in July - that faults Facebook for failing to advance civil rights, and refusing to enforce its own policies against dangerous organizations and individuals, including white supremacists and other extremists.
Recent surveys suggest more than 40 percent of Americans have experienced some form of online harassment, and that of those victims, more than 75 percent have reported being harassed on Facebook. The letter urges Facebook to implement several reforms recommended in the Civil Rights Audit to ""strengthen its commitment to civil rights and fighting disinformation and discrimination."" It further recommends steps designed to improve Facebook's supportive services for victims.
According to today's letter, much of the harassment reported by Facebook users focuses on characteristics protected by civil rights laws, including race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender and gender identity, and disability.
Such harassment can include conduct like cyberstalking, doxing (maliciously publishing someone's personal information), and swatting (filing false police reports to prompt law enforcement response targeting the victim.) The letter contends that at present, ""recourse is unavailable for too many of these victims,"" due to limitations on the services that Facebook offers victims, as well as other factors.
The Attorneys General acknowledge that ""Facebook has--on occasion--taken action to address violations of its terms of service in cases where we have helped elevate our constituents' concerns."" But the letter adds that many Facebook users continue to find the redress process ""slow, frustrating, and ineffective.""
The reforms recommended in today's letter, many of which are highlighted in the recent Civil Rights Audit, include calls for Facebook to:
* Aggressively enforce its policies against hate speech and organized hate organizations;
* Allow public, third-party audits of hate content and enforcement;
* Commit to an ongoing, independent analysis of Facebook's content population scheme and the prompt development of best practices guidance; and
* Expand policies limiting inflammatory advertisements that vilify minority groups;
The Attorneys General also recommends steps to enhance Facebook supportive services including:
* Offer live real-time assistance to victims of intimidation and harassment;
* Make information about unlawful harassment and intimidation more readily available; and
* Strengthen filtering, reporting, and blocking tools.
Joining Attorney General Herring in sending today's letter are the attorneys general of California, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin.

Mark Zuckerberg, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Sheryl Sandberg, Chief Operating Officer, Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, California 94025
Dear Mr. Zuckerberg & Ms. Sandberg:
We, the undersigned State Attorneys General, write to request that you take additional steps to prevent Facebook from being used to spread disinformation and hate and to facilitate discrimination. We also ask that you take more steps to provide redress for users who fall victim to intimidation and harassment, including violence and digital abuse.
Our nation is in the midst of a reckoning on issues of racial justice and civil rights. As State Attorneys General, we have witnessed firsthand how the country's longstanding undercurrent of discrimination has burst into the open, as reports of hate crimes and bias incidents of all kinds have dramatically increased in recent years./1 And while recent events have further highlighted the systemic injustice that persists in our society, the last few months also have seen millions of Americans join together to call for action against bias and racism.
As you know, Facebook is not immune to these problems. Although Facebook has made some progress in counteracting the use of its platform to dehumanize and demean, that is just the beginning of what is necessary./2 Private parties, organized groups, and public officials continue to use Facebook to spread misinformation and project messages of hate against different groups of Americans. In many cases, these messages lead to intimidation and harassment of particular individuals online.
According to recent surveys, more than forty percent of Americans have experienced some form of online harassment, including cyberstalking, doxing (maliciously publishing someone's personal information), and swatting (filing false police reports to prompt a law enforcement response targeting the victim)./3 Of those Americans who report having been harassed online, more than three-quarters have reported being harassed on Facebook./4 Much of that harassment is focused on characteristics protected by the civil rights laws that many of us are charged with enforcing, including race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender and gender identity, and disability./5 Recourse is unavailable for too many of these victims, due to limitations on the services that Facebook offers victims and other impediments to securing relief through civil lawsuits or criminal prosecutions.
We understand that Facebook has committed to the public and its users that it will ""invest billions of dollars each year to keep [Facebook's] community safe and continuously work with outside experts to review and update [Facebook's] policies.""/6 But, as the most recent Civil Rights Audit reveals, the steps you have taken thus far have fallen short. With the vast resources at your disposal, we believe there is much more that you can do to prevent the use of Facebook as a vehicle for misinformation and discrimination, and to prevent your users from being victimized by harassment and intimidation on your platforms.
As State Attorneys General, we are responsible for protecting the safety and wellbeing of all the communities we serve. As part of that mission, we must constantly contend with the impacts of online hate, intimidation, and harassment. Many of our offices enforce the laws that protect our residents from bias offenses, intimidation, and harassment--whether online or on our streets./7 And many of our offices include units dedicated to serving the victims of unlawful conduct, including helping them access and use tools that allow them to vindicate their rights. As part of our responsibilities to our communities, Attorneys General have helped residents navigate Facebook's processes for victims to address abuse on its platform. While Facebook has--on occasion--taken action to address violations of its terms of service in cases where we have helped elevate our constituents' concerns,/8 we know that everyday users of Facebook can find the process slow, frustrating, and ineffective. Thus, we write to highlight positive steps that Facebook can take to strengthen its policies and practices. We hope to work with you to ensure that fewer individuals suffer online harassment and discrimination, and that it is quickly and effectively addressed when they do.
Based on our collective experience, we believe that Facebook should take additional actions including the following steps--many of which are highlighted in Facebook's recent Civil Rights Audit--to strengthen its commitment to civil rights and fighting disinformation and discrimination:
* Aggressively enforce Facebook policies against hate speech and organized hate organizations: Although Facebook has developed policies against hate speech and organizations that peddle it, we remain concerned that Facebook's policies on Dangerous Individuals and Organizations, including but not limited to its policies on white nationalist and white supremacist content, are not enforced quickly and comprehensively enough./9 Content that violates Facebook's own policies too often escapes removal just because it comes as coded language, rather than specific magic words. And even where Facebook takes steps to address a particular violation, it often fails to proactively address the follow-on actions by replacement or splinter groups that quickly emerge.
* Allow public, third-party audits of hate content and enforcement: To gauge the ongoing progress of Facebook's enforcement efforts, independent experts should be permitted access to the data necessary to conduct regular, transparent third-party audits of hate and hate-related misinformation on the platform, including any information made available to the Global Oversight Board. As part of this effort, Facebook should capture data on the prevalence of different forms of hate content on the platform, whether or not covered by Facebook's own community standards, thus allowing the public to determine whether enforcement of anti-hate policies differs based on the type of hate content at issue.
* Commit to an ongoing, independent analysis of Facebook's content population scheme and the prompt development of best practices guidance: By funneling users toward particular types of content, Facebook's content population scheme, including its algorithms, can push users into extremist online communities that feature divisive and inflammatory messages, often directed at particular groups. Although Facebook has conducted research and considered programs to reduce this risk, there is still no mandatory guidance for coders and other teams involved in content population. Facebook should commit to an ongoing, independent analysis of its content population scheme, including its algorithms, and also continuously implement mandatory protocols as best practices are identified to curb bias and prevent recommendations of hate content and groups.
* Expand policies limiting inflammatory advertisements that vilify minority groups: Although Facebook currently prohibits ads that claim that certain people, because of their membership in a protected group, pose a threat to the physical safety of communities or the nation, its policies still allow attacks that characterize such groups as threats to national culture or values.10 The current prohibition should be expanded to include such ads.
We also recommend the following measures to improve the supportive services that Facebook offers to users who have been or may become victims of harassment and intimidation on its platforms:
* Offer live real-time assistance: Facebook users can report intimidation and harassment but cannot immediately engage a Facebook employee who can promptly address issues that are occurring in real time. Victims of intimidation and harassment would benefit from more immediate access to Facebook employees who can offer prompt assistance. For example, if a user is being doxed, live assistance could help stop the spread of the user's personal information before the damage cannot be undone.
* Make information about harassment and intimidation more readily available: Facebook should facilitate evidence preservation and cooperate with victims and law enforcement agencies seeking evidence to prove a case of harassment or intimidation, such as cyberstalking or non-consensual distribution of intimate imagery, when the offenders use Facebook to perpetrate their crimes.
* Strengthen filtering, reporting, and blocking tools: Facebook allows users to block individual people, but users should have stronger tools and more choices for filtering out and reporting hateful, intimidating, and harassing content they do not want to see in their feeds. For example, if members of a Facebook group are engaged in an organized campaign of harassment against a single user, the victim should be able to block all members of the group and report batches of posts or users without having to block or report each individually.
We urge Facebook to take these steps to better tackle hate in our society, and address the interests of users who are victimized by others in the online community that Facebook has built.

73,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_751/Files (250).DOCX","The New York Times",2020-06-05,"1373 words","US; politics","Nicholas Fandos",NA,"Frustration and Fury as Rand Paul Holds Up Anti-Lynching Bill in Senate",FALSE,"A dispute over legislation to make lynching a federal crime has grown fierce as Congress turns its attention to issues of race and law enforcement amid protests across the country.
As Congress prepares to wade into a contentious debate over legislation to address police brutality and systemic racial bias, a long-simmering dispute in the Senate over a far less controversial bill that would for the first time explicitly make lynching a federal crime has burst into public view.
The bill, called the Emmett Till Antilynching Act after the 14-year-old black boy who was tortured and killed in 1955 in Mississippi, predates the recent high-profile deaths of three black men and women at the hands of white police and civilians that have inspired protests across the country. It passed the House this year by a vote of 410 to 4, and has the backing of 99 senators, who have urged support for belated federal recognition of a crime that once terrorized black Americans.
But the private objections of one Republican, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, have succeeded for months in preventing it from becoming law. At a time when lawmakers are looking at an array of other, potentially more divisive proposals to respond to a spate of recent killings of black Americans, the impasse illustrates the volatile mix of raw emotion and political division that has often frustrated attempts by Congress to enact meaningful changes in the law when it comes to matters of racial violence.
The issue erupted on the Senate floor on Thursday afternoon, when Mr. Paul sought to narrow the bill’s definition of lynching and push the revised measure through without a formal vote, drawing angry rebukes from two of the bill’s authors, Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California, both African-American Democrats.
Mr. Paul argued that the lynching bill was sloppily written and could lead to yet another injustice — excessive sentencing for minor infractions — unless it was revised.
“This bill would cheapen the meaning of lynching by defining it so broadly as to include a minor bruise or abrasion,” he said. “Our national history of racial terrorism demands more seriousness of us than that.”
Mr. Paul said that he took lynching seriously, but “this legislation does not.”
Ms. Harris rose to object, delivering a seething broadside against Mr. Paul as she noted that even as they debated, mourners were gathering to honor George Floyd, the African-American man who died last week after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.
“The idea that we would not be taking the issue of lynching seriously is an insult — an insult to Senator Booker and Senator Tim Scott and myself,” she said from across the chamber floor, referring to the South Carolina Republican who helped write the bill and is the party’s lone black senator.
“To suggest that lynching would only be a lynching if someone’s heart was pulled out and displayed to someone else is ridiculous,” she added. “It should not require a maiming or torture for us to recognize a lynching when we see it and recognize it by federal law and call it what it is, which is that it is a crime that should be punishable with accountability and consequence.”
At issue is what, exactly, counts as lynching under federal law. The bill would add a new section called “lynching” to the civil rights statute to deal with group violence meant to intimidate people of color or other protected groups. The offense would be classified as a conspiracy by two or more people to cause bodily harm in connection with a hate crime, with penalties up to life in prison if convicted. Mr. Paul proposed to raise the bar beyond the standard in federal hate crimes statutes, to “serious bodily injury,” so that only crimes involving conspiracy to cause “substantial risk of death and extreme physical pain” could be charged as lynching, according to aides.
Such crimes can already be considered hate crimes under state and federal law. But the term lynching has deep historical significance, and the fact that it has never been formally outlawed has been an enduring symbol of Congress’s inability to fully reckon with the nation’s history of racial violence. The issue has taken on even greater significance in recent days.
Ms. Harris called the recent killing of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old black man jogging in Georgia who was chased down and shot by white men, “a modern lynching.” In court on Thursday, one of the men charged with murder in the case said he heard another use a racial slur as Mr. Arbery lay dying.
Members of Congress have been fighting in one way or another to pass federal anti-lynching laws for more than a century, introducing nearly 200 such bills in the first half of the 20th century. When such a law would have had the most explicit effect, during the Jim Crow era when thousands of black people where lynched across the country, Southern senators succeeded repeatedly in blocking its passage.
The Senate formally apologized in 2005 for failing to outlaw the practice, and long ago adopted other measures to make racially motivated killings federal crimes.
Speaking after Ms. Harris on Thursday, Mr. Booker, describing himself as “raw” over the state of the country, pleaded with Mr. Paul to drop his objections, if only to offer a glimmer of hope to a nation in pain.
“Does America need a win today on racial justice? Does the anguished cries of people in the streets?” he asked. “It may not cure the ills so many are protesting about, but God, it could be a sign of hope.”
Mr. Paul has such influence because senators are trying to pass the bill by unanimous consent, rather than through a traditional recorded vote, meaning any one senator can grind consideration to a halt. The bill would easily have passed were it put up for a regular vote, but Republican leaders have so far been unwilling to go that route because it would eat up several days of the full Senate’s time and they believe Mr. Paul may yet be persuaded to drop his objections.
Mr. Booker and Mr. Paul have worked together on criminal justice legislation in the past, and are recognized as two of the Senate’s leading advocates for reducing prison sentences and lowering incarceration rates. But Mr. Booker chastised Mr. Paul for being the lone obstacle in Congress to the anti-lynching bill.
“Tell me another time when 500-plus Congress people — Democrats, Republicans, House members and senators — come together in a chorus of conviction and say, ‘Now is the time in America that we condemn the dark history of our past and actually pass anti-lynching legislation,’” Mr. Booker said.
Mr. Paul conceded that his position was unpopular, but insisted that changes were necessary so that the measure would be worthy of its name.
“You think I take joy in being here?” he said. “I will be excoriated by simple minded people on the internet who think somehow I don’t like Emmett Till or appreciate the history or memory of Emmett Till.”
Mr. Paul said he was concerned that the bill would allow excessive penalties against people who commit more minor, racially motivated acts of violence, like slapping or pushing. He did not account for why his position had changed from last year, when he supported the bill as written.
“Words have meaning,” he said. “It would be a disgrace for the Congress of the United States to declare that a bruise is lynching, that an abrasion is lynching, that any injury to the body, no matter how temporary, is on par with the atrocities done to people like Emmett Till.”
Mr. Booker said the notion that anyone would be charged with lynching for slapping someone was “absurd.”
Mr. Paul did not back down, and senators left Washington for the week without reaching a resolution, leaving Democrats calling the episode a missed opportunity.
“The frustrating thing for me is that at a time this country hungers for common-sense racial reconciliation, an acknowledgment of our past and a looking forward to a better future, this will be one of the sad days where that possibility was halted,” Mr. Booker said.

74,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_751/Files (250).DOCX","thestar.com",2020-10-06,"917 words","OPINION; Pg. 0","Daniel Bernhard",NA,"Is Facebook complicit in Toronto mosque murder? Let a judge decide",FALSE,"Mohamed-Aslim Zafis was murdered last month, simply for standing outside a mosque. This murder was not an apparent random act of violence and a judge should decide whether Facebook is a knowing party to this hate crime.
The suspect is reported to follow several Facebook groups that ""worship Hitler as a God figure"" and advocate ""culling"" civilization of Jews, Muslims, and other identifiable minorities. If we believe Facebook's own research, there is a 64 per cent chance the suspect would not have found these groups, let alone joined them, had Facebook not recommended them to him.
The criminal code says that ""Every one who, by communicating statements, other than in private conversation, wilfully promotes hatred against any identifiable group is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years."" There seems to be little doubt that calling for Jews and Muslims to be ""culled"" constitutes ""wilful promotion.""
But if Facebook is actively recommending these groups and their seemingly illegal invective to people, isn't that wilful promotion too?
It's time for a judge to weigh in.
Parliament has studied the issue of online hate in an attempt to develop new laws for dealing with online hate. However, newly released research by FRIENDS of Canadian Broadcasting argues that new laws may not be necessary: intermediaries like Facebook are very arguably liable under existing Canadian law for their role in spreading such content.
Illegal content is far more prevalent online than most people realize. For example, the New York Times recently reported that child sexual abuse imagery on these platforms is so rampant that the FBI only has enough resources to investigate cases involving infants and toddlers. The U.S. National Center for Missing and Exploited Children received 45 million reports of child sexual abuse imagery in 2018 alone. That's more than 120,000 images and videos of children being sexually abused every day.
The main question is not whether social media platforms circulate this criminal content - they admit it. The question is whether recommending illegal content makes Facebook party to the crime.
It is beyond ironic that Facebook, a world leader in AI, cites ignorance as its primary defence. The big platforms have long argued that they are just passive digital billboards that exercise no editorial judgment over users' posts and therefore bear no responsibility for disseminating illegal content they may contain. They admit that their algorithms recommend illegal content but exonerate themselves by pleading an inability find every illegal utterance buried among the 100 billion posts they publish daily. Both claims are dubious.
Long-standing common law says that those who publish illegal content are liable for it, alongside those who create it. This liability is triggered when publishers know the content is harmful but publish anyway, or if they don't remove it after being notified of it.
The latter case is clear cut. Facebook and other social media platforms have complaints processes where they are alerted to potentially illegal and otherwise objectionable content. Yet, as we have seen on multiple occasions, Facebook has no intent of acting.
In Kenosha Wisc., Facebook received more than 450 complaints about an event encouraging vigilantes to bring rifles to a counterprotest, yet did not remove it. One member of the group said: ""I fully plan to kill looters and rioters tonight."" Facebook recommended this event to thousands of people. A 17-year-old man responded to the invitation and murdered two people. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg chalked it up to ""an operational mistake.""
But responsiveness to complaints is only part of the problem. By its own admission, Facebook, Google, and other social media giants have detailed advanced knowledge of content that may be illegal but circulate it anyway.
Google has boasted that its Google Assistant can converse so naturally that humans don't know they're talking to a machine. Are we meant to believe that this same technology cannot identify threats or hate speech in YouTube videos it recommends to users who do not seek them out?
As early as 2017, Facebook boasted that most terrorist content is removed before a human user ever sees it, implying that their software exercises editorial judgment in the milliseconds between the time users click ""post"" and the time those posts become visible. They have even claimed the ability to identify suicidal ideation on Facebook Live in real time. Yet somehow, they expect us to believe that they only become aware of illegal content once users notify them of it. I, for one, remain unconvinced.
I can already hear the cries of horror from ""free expression"" fundamentalists, who forget that it is already illegal for broadcasters, newspapers, or other intermediaries to publish defamatory remarks, threats, incitement to violence, and child sexual abuse imagery, even if those are supplied by others. Holding platforms liable for recommending illegal content would not create any new restrictions on free expression.
Of course, it's not up to me to decide whether Facebook is complicit in the hate crimes, like the murder of Mr. Aslim Zafis. That's a job for a judge. Police and prosecutors should take the time to consider the argument above, and perhaps provide a judge with an opportunity to weigh in.

It's a skill required for just about every profession-the ability to identify, analyze, and resolve conflicts. Starting in fall 2021, Buffalo State College will be the first in the State University of New York (SUNY) system and in Western New York to offer graduate instruction in just that area when it introduces an interdisciplinary master of science in conflict analysis and resolution. The college will also be developing a graduate certificate program in the same field.
Buffalo State's new School of Arts and Sciences, which also launches in fall 2021, will house the interdisciplinary programs that the New York State Education Department and SUNY recently approved.
The 30-credit-hour master's program and developing 12-credit-hour certificate program will address the need for highly skilled conflict resolvers to work in myriad professions, including business, government, education, health care, criminal justice, ministry, and labor relations.
""The closest school that currently offers such a master's is Cornell University,"" said Peter Yacobucci, associate professor of political science and public administration, who serves as co-coordinator of the program with Clairissa Breen, assistant professor of criminal justice. ""And its program more narrowly focuses on labor relations.""
""Conflict analysis and resolution is an innovative program that relies on one of the skills employers most often say they seek-the ability to assess conflict, resolve it, and ensure it doesn't reoccur,"" said Buffalo State Provost Jim Mayrose. ""I'm thrilled that we will be the first SUNY school to offer such a program. Not only will it provide graduates with a highly marketable set of skills; it will also provide a terrific opportunity for cross-disciplinary collaboration on campus.""
Participating faculty currently represent nine academic programs or departments: Adult Education, Business, Creative Studies, Criminal Justice, Economics and Finance, Educational Leadership, International Relations, Political Science, and Sociology.
""It's apparent that conflict resolution is a huge problem in multiple fields,"" said Yacobucci, who studies conflict in the political realm, including the increase in hyper-partisanship in the United States. Meanwhile, Breen describes herself as a ""conflict criminologist,"" with a focus on hate crimes and terrorism.
""What we found is that everyone was working on conflict resolution within their own areas,"" Yacobucci said. ""We thought, Why don't we put together a program that combines the theory and methods for handling and resolving conflict that can be applied across disciplines and fields?""
Three years ago, former Buffalo State Provost Melanie Perreault asked Yacobucci to help shape the program and to identify faculty members in other departments who could teach the relevant courses.
""Every single person I approached was willing to be a part of it,"" Yacobucci said. ""It's been a cooperative process. We're really excited about getting it started.""
Breen, who joined the criminal justice faculty in fall 2016 and is certified as an anti-terrorism specialist, was a natural fit to serve as co-coordinator. When she heard about the need for faculty members to lead this burgeoning program, she didn't hesitate.
""Put the word 'conflict' in front of me, and I raise my hand,"" she said.
The audience for the program includes both current undergraduate students who would like to continue their education by becoming experts at resolving conflicts and professionals wanting to obtain strategies for conflict analysis and resolution that they can apply to their jobs, their communities, and the world at large.
As she and Yacobucci continue to design the curriculum and market the program this academic year, Breen said, they will focus on combining real-world experiences and academic theories. This will ensure that students can understand the origin of conflicts and how they can decrease them.
""Resolution becomes the most important part of the equation,"" she said. For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at contentservices@htlive.com"

With federal efforts lacking, Asian Americans are starting social media campaigns to combat the rise in racism they have faced during the coronavirus pandemic.
In a video released Tuesday on several social media platforms, a group of Asian people in face masks detailed the discrimination, harassment and racism they have experienced during the pandemic — such as being told to ""go back to China"" or having people cough at them or spit in their direction.
Pulling off their masks, they reveal their occupations as firefighter, nurse, doctor, deliverywoman, bus driver and other roles considered essential during the pandemic. The minute-long video ends with each of them calling to Fight the Virus. Fight the Bias — the title of the video.
Produced by the Advertising Council, a nonprofit organization that makes public service announcements, and Emmy Award-winning writer Alan Yang, the video is aimed at building a sense of humanity and breaking the silence around the hatred impacting the Asian American community.
""Amid this pandemic and the stresses associated, nobody should have to also endure the added layer of fear that comes from this surge in racial violence and harassment,"" said Advertising Council President and CEO Lisa Sherman in a press release. She said the video is expected to inspire Americans to rethink their biases and help end the wave of racism facing Asian Americans.
Reports by many civil rights organizations show that Asian communities across the US have endured increasing harassment and assaults since the spread of the novel coronavirus in the country.
The Anti-Defamation League has recently compiled a long list of coronavirus-related anti-Asian incidents from January to June, including people being physically assaulted, properties vandalized, and an online meeting disrupted by anti-Asian slurs in the chat function.
Stop AAPI Hate, a coronavirus-related racism-reporting platform, recorded more than 2,000 incidents across the country in three months.
Statements by President Donald Trump and his allies referring to COVID-19 as the ""Chinese virus"" or the ""kung flu"" have fueled xenophobia and bigotry toward people of Chinese descent and other Asian Americans, said Russell Jeung, chair and professor of Asian American Studies at San Francisco State University.
""President Trump's insistent use of the term 'Chinese virus' creates an implicit association that the virus is Chinese, and that Chinese people have the virus,"" Jeung told China Daily.
Subsequently, others have blamed Chinese and Asians in the US for being the source of the disease and for bringing it to the US, said Jeung, who compiled the Stop AAPI Hate data. He noted that when Trump began using the terms, bias incidents against Asian Americans jumped.
""It's clear that President Trump is scapegoating China for the pandemic. He does so to deflect responsibility for his poor handling of this public health crisis and more recently to avoid dealing with Black Lives Matter and America's racial injustices,"" said Jeung. ""By blaming China, he seeks to create an outside enemy that his political base could be angry with.""
A new survey by the Pew Research Center shows that 4 in 10 US adults say it has become more common for people to express racist views toward Asians since the pandemic began.
About a quarter of the Asian American respondents say they feared someone might threaten or physically attack them, a higher percentage than for any other group.
The Trump administration has been criticized for doing little about the rise in anti-Asian hate amid the pandemic, in comparison to actions taken in similar situations such as the SARS outbreak and the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
For instance, after the 9/11 attacks, former President George W. Bush, a Republican, and the attorney general and FBI director immediately issued statements that hate crimes and discrimination against Arab, Muslim, Sikh and South Asian Americans would not be tolerated, and the Justice Department officials had attended more than 100 meetings and events with leaders from those communities, according to the Center for Public Integrity.
""When the coronavirus pandemic hit the US, President Trump failed to protect the Asian Americans. He uses China as the scapegoat and incites racial hysteria by using slurs such as 'Chinese virus' and 'kung flu,'"" said Julie Tang, retired judge of San Francisco Superior Court and a civil rights activist. ""The Chinese Americans felt the sting of the demonizing of China in the press and by the administration.""
Tang has joined the grassroots efforts to raise the awareness of pandemic-related harassment by launching a campaign using a Facebook profile picture filter. The campaign calls on people to wear a virtual mask on their Facebook page that says, ""Fight the Virus, not Asians"".
Americans should also be aware that the Chinese community has been a role model in fighting the pandemic, said California state Senator Scott Wiener, who represents San Francisco, during an online news conference Tuesday.
""The Chinese community is setting a very strong example of everyone wearing masks and wearing them correctly ... being responsible and being safe and being respectful towards the community,"" said Wiener.
""Chinatown is the densest neighborhood west of the Mississippi, and it's had very few infections,"" he said. ""That's not just random. That's because the Chinese community has stepped up and shown leadership and modeled good behavior for the rest of the community, and I'm very grateful for that,"" he said."

Mendel Goldstein, 63, of Brooklyn, New York, admitted in San Diego federal court to depositing money earned through his freelance videography business into Chabad bank accounts, which Yisroel Goldstein funneled back to him through checks signed to fictitious people such as ""Mr. Green,"" ""Mr. Gold"" or ""Mr. Fish,"" according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.
The scheme began in 2012, with an agreement that Yisroel Goldstein, 58, would keep 10% of the deposited income as a fee, prosecutors said.
Mendel Goldstein, who saved about $155,881 in taxes through the scam, is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 14, with the charges carrying a maximum possible penalty of five years in prison, the U.S. Attorney's Office said.
""People who cheat on their taxes are cheating all honest taxpayers,"" said U.S. Attorney Robert Brewer. ""We will not tolerate the exploitation of non-profit and religious organizations to line the perpetrators' pockets at society's expense.""
Yisroel Goldstein and two others were wounded in the April 27, 2019, shooting at Chabad of Poway that killed congregant Lori Gilbert Kaye. The alleged shooter, nursing student John T. Earnest, 21, remains in custody on state and federal charges, including allegations that the attack was a hate crime.
Prosecutors say the rabbi was under investigation prior to the shooting for a number of fraud schemes, including one in which he funneled supposedly charitable donations made to the synagogue back to donors. Similar to the agreement with his brother, Goldstein kept about 10% of the donations and sent the remainder back to the donors, prosecutors said.
The U.S. Attorney's Office said that once he discovered he was under investigation, he alerted his older brother and advised him to hide the tax evasion by filing delinquent tax returns.
Goldstein pleaded guilty to wire fraud and conspiracy charges in July along with five co-defendants, and prosecutors say he has agreed to cooperate against others potentially involved in the fraud.
The U.S. Attorney's Office said it will recommend probation at Goldstein's sentencing next April. He has also agreed to pay $2.5 million in restitution as part of the plea agreement.
Suzanne Turner, Special Agent in Charge of FBI's San Diego Field Office, said, ""This investigation uncovered a conspiracy of crimes involving fraud, deception and evasion that used the cloak of a tax-exempt religious organization, the Chabad of Poway, for personal financial benefit."""

A15","Daniel Bernhard Contributor",NA,"Is Facebook complicit in murder at mosque?",FALSE,"Mohamed-Aslim Zafis was murdered last month, simply for standing outside a mosque. This murder was not an apparent random act of violence and a judge should decide whether Facebook is a knowing party to this hate crime.
The suspect is reported to follow several Facebook groups that ""worship Hitler as a God figure"" and advocate ""culling"" civilization of Jews, Muslims, and other identifiable minorities. If we believe Facebook's own research, there is a 64 per cent chance the suspect would not have found these groups, let alone joined them, had Facebook not recommended them to him.
The criminal code says that ""Every one who, by communicating statements, other than in private conversation, wilfully promotes hatred against any identifiable group is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years."" There seems to be little doubt that calling for Jews and Muslims to be ""culled"" constitutes ""wilful promotion.""
But if Facebook is actively recommending these groups and their seemingly illegal invective to people, isn't that wilful promotion, too?
It's time for a judge to weigh in.
Parliament has studied the issue of online hate in an attempt to develop new laws for dealing with online hate. However, newly released research by Friends of Canadian Broadcasting argues that new laws may not be necessary: intermediaries like Facebook are very arguably liable under existing Canadian law for their role in spreading such content.
Illegal content is far more prevalent online than most people realize. For example, the New York Times recently reported that child sexual abuse imagery on these platforms is so rampant that the FBI only has enough resources to investigate cases involving infants and toddlers. The U.S. National Center for Missing and Exploited Children received 45 million reports of child sexual abuse imagery in 2018 alone. That's more than 120,000 images and videos of children being sexually abused every day.
The main question is not whether social media platforms circulate this criminal content - they admit it. The question is whether recommending illegal content makes Facebook party to the crime.
It is beyond ironic that Facebook, a world leader in AI, cites ignorance as its primary defence. The big platforms have long argued that they are just passive digital billboards that exercise no editorial judgment over users' posts and therefore bear no responsibility for disseminating illegal content they may contain.
They admit that their algorithms recommend illegal content but exonerate themselves by pleading an inability find every illegal utterance buried among the 100 billion posts they publish daily. Both claims are dubious.
Long-standing common law says that those who publish illegal content are liable for it, alongside those who create it. This liability is triggered when publishers know the content is harmful but publish anyway, or if they don't remove it after being notified of it.
The latter case is clear cut. Facebook and other social media platforms have complaints processes where they are alerted to potentially illegal and otherwise objectionable content. Yet, as we have seen on multiple occasions, Facebook has no intent of acting.
In Kenosha Wis., Facebook received more than 450 complaints about an event encouraging vigilantes to bring rifles to a counterprotest, yet did not remove it. One member of the group said: ""I fully plan to kill looters and rioters tonight.""
Facebook recommended this event to thousands of people. A 17-year-old man responded to the invitation and murdered two people. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg chalked it up to ""an operational mistake.""
But responsiveness to complaints is only part of the problem. By its own admission, Facebook, Google, and other social media giants have detailed advanced knowledge of content that may be illegal but circulate it anyway.
Google has boasted that its Google Assistant can converse so naturally that humans don't know they're talking to a machine. Are we meant to believe that this same technology cannot identify threats or hate speech in YouTube videos it recommends to users who do not seek them out?
As early as 2017, Facebook boasted that most terrorist content is removed before a human user ever sees it, implying that their software exercises editorial judgment in the milliseconds between the time users click ""post"" and the time those posts become visible. They have even claimed the ability to identify suicidal ideation on Facebook Live in real time. Yet somehow, they expect us to believe that they only become aware of illegal content once users notify them of it. I, for one, remain unconvinced.
I can already hear the cries of horror from ""free expression"" fundamentalists, who forget that it is already illegal for broadcasters, newspapers, or other intermediaries to publish defamatory remarks, threats, incitement to violence, and child sexual abuse imagery, even if those are supplied by others. Holding platforms liable for recommending illegal content would not create any new restrictions on free expression.
Of course, it's not up to me to decide whether Facebook is complicit in the hate crimes. That's a job for a judge. Police and prosecutors should take the time to consider the argument above, and perhaps provide a judge with an opportunity to weigh in.

AMSTERDAM, NYCongressman Paul D. Tonko joined with more than 200 of his Congressional colleagues this morning to introduce the Justice in Policing Act of 2020 , legislation that would, among other things, ban police chokeholds, restrict ""qualified immunity"" that prevents police officers from being sued for misconduct, create a national registry to track officers with a history of misconduct, end no-knock warrant use for drug cases and make lynching a federal hate crime. The bill is being led by Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.), who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, and Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, as well as Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.).
""The murder of George Floyd has shocked the conscience of millions of Americans and once again exposed the virulent racism that has long festered at the heart of so many of our nation's institutions, including the manner in which we enforce the law,"" said Tonko. ""Our bill takes several urgent steps forward in addressing the most dangerous and deadly policing practices that have been widely and disproportionately used against Black Americans and other people of color. One piece of legislation cannot cure 400 years of racial violence, injustice and economic oppression. Much of our collective work remains unfinished. However, Congress and the President should move without delay to pass and sign into law the Justice in Policing Act of 2020. The American people are demanding immediate action. Let us heed their call at once.""
The Justice in Policing Act of 2020 includes:
Major Unprecedented Reforms to Curb Police Brutality, End Racial Profiling, and Eliminate Qualified Immunity for Law Enforcement
The first-ever comprehensive approach to hold police accountable for misconduct, change the culture of law enforcement and build trust between law enforcement and our communities.
Makes it easier for the federal government to successfully prosecute police misconduct cases, ends racial and religious profiling and eliminates qualified immunity for law enforcement.
Bans the use of chokeholds and no-knock warrantswhich took the lives of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Eric Garnerat the federal level and encourages states to do the same.
Measures to Transform the Culture of Policing to Address Systemic Racism and Help Save Lives
Does not provide any new federal funds for police departments , except where constitutionally-mandated for data collection, and instead supports critical community-based programs to change the culture of law enforcement and empower our communities to reimagine public safety in an equitable and just way.
Establishes public safety innovation grants for community-based organizations to create local commissions and task forces to help communities develop concrete alternative policing practices that create accountability.
Encourages departments to meet a gold standard in training, hiring and de-escalation strategies to address systemic racism and bias on the front end. This will help save lives and ensure accountability.
Increases to Police Accountability and Transparency
Establishes the first-ever national database of civilian police encounters , including use of force and traffic stops; requires the collection, analysis and release of such data.
Requires the collection of data on police-misconduct to track and prevent dangerous officers from moving from one department to another to avoid accountability.
Incentivizes the use of independent prosecutors for police misconduct investigations.
Helps take weapons and equipment manufactured for the battlefield off of our streets.
Requires the use of body and dashboard cameras."

Office of the Press Secretary
July 6, 2020 PRESS BRIEFING BY PRESS SECRETARY KAYLEIGH MCENANY
James S. Brady Press Briefing Room
1:29 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY: All right. Hello, everyone. Over the holiday weekend, President Trump delivered two defining, unifying, and patriotic speeches, which drew widespread praise by those who cherish our values, honor our history, and seek to advance policies that lift up all Americans.
The President outlined a vision for the future. The President outlined a vision for stronger and safer communities. President Trump said, ""After all, what do we want"" We want a strong military, great education, housing, low taxes, law and order."" He went on to say, ""We want safety, we want equal justice, we want religious liberty, we want faith and family, and living in the great communities and happy communities and safe communities. And we want great jobs, and we want to be respected by the rest of the world, not taken advantage of by the rest of the world."" He went on to say, ""We should all want the same thing. How can it be any different than those things?""
This message is now more important and more timely than ever. Radical left-wing mobs seek to tear down our monuments and our memorials -- everyone from George Washington to Abraham Lincoln to Frederick Douglass, and even Gandhi. Misguided movements, such as ""Defund the Police,"" seek to leave our communities more vulnerable than ever. Case in point: This weekend alone, in New York, there were 44 shootings with 11 killed; in Chicago, 75 people were shot with 13 killed; and tragically, at least five of these individuals were children who were killed in cities across the country. An absolutely devastating loss, and we grieve for those families. Crimes such as this is dark and it is divisive.
This July 4th, the President said, ""Our movement is based on lifting all citizens to reach their fullest God-given potential. Never forget: We are one family and one nation...We will teach our children to cherish and adore their country so...they can build its future.""
This vision is not a culture war, as the media seeks to falsely proclaim; it's an embrace of our American family, our values, our freedom, and our future.
And with that, I'll take questions.
Peter.
Q Kayleigh, I want to ask you just a couple questions. The first one: Why is the President so supportive of flying the Confederate flag?
MS. MCENANY: So I think you're referring to a tweet this morning. Is that right?
Q Correct.
MS. MCENANY: Well, I think you're mischaracterizing the tweet. The tweet was aimed at pointing out that the FBI report of the alleged hate crime at NASCAR concluded that the garage door pull, which had been there since last fall, was obviously not targeted at a specific individual because, in fact, it was a garage pull and, in fact, it was there since last fall, long before these 43 teams arrived. And it was concluded by the FBI that this was, quote, ""not an intentional racist act.""
Q For clarity, I'm asking you about the Confederate flags. My question is: Why is the President so supportive of flying the Confederate flag?
MS. MCENANY: The President never said that. Again, you're taking his tweet completely out of context.
Q The President said that NASCAR saw bad ratings because they took down the Confederate flag, banned the Confederate flag. Does he believe NASCAR should fly the Confederate flag"" And why don't they fly it here?
MS. MCENANY: The whole point of the tweet was to note the incident, the alleged hate crime that, in fact, was not a hate crime. At the very end, the ban on the flag was mentioned in the broader context of the fact that he rejects this notion that somehow NASCAR men and women who go to these sporting events are racist when, in fact, as it turns out, what we saw with the FBI report and the alleged incident of a hate crime -- it was a complete indictment of the media's rush to judgment once again, calling this a hate crime when the FBI completely dismissed that.
Q Let me ask you about some of the President's comments this weekend. The President said that 99 percent of coronavirus cases are totally harmless. Which members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force agree with that statement?
MS. MCENANY: So what the President was pointing to -- and I'm glad you brought it up -- was a factual statement, one that is rooted in science and one that was pointing out the fact that mortality in this country is very low. And I have two charts that we'll pull up to illustrate that.
The first chart is the case fatality rate in the United States. And as you can see, the mortality rate has gone like this -- (motions downward) -- the case fatality rate. And also, in the second chart you'll see -- hopefully they have it up behind me -- but the case rate -- fatality rate in this country vis-a-vis other European countries is much lower than, let's say, France and Italy. And what that speaks to is the great work of this administration with therapeutics and remdesivir and dexamethasone. And that's what the President was pointing out.
Q So I want to get back to --
MS. MCENANY: Jon.
Q -- just to follow up quickly, though. So if you don't die, is it not harmless?
MS. MCENANY: The President was noting the fact that the vast majority of Americans who contract coronavirus will come out on the other side of this. Of course, he takes this very seriously. Of course, no one wants to see anyone in this country contract COVID, which is why the administration has fought hard to make sure that's not the case with our historic response effort.
Jon.
Q Kayleigh, to follow on Peter's question, what is the President's position"" Does he think NASCAR made a mistake by banning the Confederate flag?
MS. MCENANY: So he said he -- I spoke to him this morning about this, and he said he was not making a judgment one way or the other. The intent of the tweet was to stand up for the men and women of NASCAR and the fans and those who have gone, and this rush to judgment of the media to call something a hate crime when, in fact, the FBI report concluded this was not an intentional racist act. And it very much mirrors other times when there have been a rush to judgment, let's say with the Covington boys or with Jussie Smollett.
Q But let's drill down on the Confederate flag. Does he think it was a mistake for NASCAR to ban it?
MS. MCENANY: The President said he wasn't making a judgment one way or the other. You're focusing on --
Q But what is his position on it?
MS. MCENANY: -- one word at the very bottom of a tweet that's completely taken out of context and neglecting the complete rush to judgment on this.
Q Wasn't he saying that NASCAR's rating were down because they banned the flag"" That's what he said.
MS. MCENANY: The President was noting the fact that, in aggregate, this notion that NASCAR men and women who have gone and who are being demeaned and called racist, and being accused in some venues of committing a hate crime against an individual, those allegations were just dead wrong.
Q Does he think --
MS. MCENANY: Paula.
Q Does he think his supporters should not take the flag to Trump rallies"" Has he considered banning the Confederate flag from Trump rallies?
MS. MCENANY: Well, at Trump rallies, all flags that are not official campaign gear are banned.
Yes.
Q Kayleigh, why is it Bubba Wallace's responsibility to apologize for an investigation into a noose that he didn't report and he never even saw"" It was NASCAR that found this, that reported this. And even the FBI referred to it as a noose, even if they said it wasn't a specific crime against Mr. Wallace. Why is the President even suggesting that Mr. Wallace should apologize?
MS. MCENANY: Well, look, the FBI, as I noted, concluded that this was not a hate crime, and he believes it'd go a long way if Bubba came out and acknowledged that as well --
Q He has.
MS. MCENANY: This was not --
Q He has.
MS. MCENANY: -- a hate crime, as noted --
Q In interviews, he's been very clear that --
MS. MCENANY: -- by the FBI. So, the President --
Q -- the FBI found this was not intentional.
MS. MCENANY: One of the things --
Q Why is he directing this at Mr. Wallace?
MS. MCENANY: So one of the things that --
Q He was a victim of a suspected hate crime.
MS. MCENANY: One of -- this is where the President comes from, and this is where the President stands, and he actually hinted at this in his July 4th speech: ""To those in the media who falsely and consistently label their opponents as racist, who condemn patriotic citizens who offer a clear and truthful defense of American unity, we want a clear and faithful defense of American history and unity. And when you level false charges, you not only slander me, you slander the American people."" He believes --
Q Who was charged"" It was an open investigation, Kayleigh --
MS. MCENANY: -- the American people are good. And the allegations --
Q -- into a noose. The FBI said --
MS. MCENANY: -- and the rush to judgement --
Q -- it was a noose.
MS. MCENANY: -- with Jussie Smollett and the Bubba Wallace case and with the Covington Catholic boys, we shouldn't be so quick to jump onto those narratives. Those are just three examples of those --
Q But you're suggesting that Mr. Wallace --
MS. MCENANY: that have been proven false.
Yes.
Q -- should apologize for an investigation that someone else initiated, suggesting he was possibly the victim of a hate crime?
MS. MCENANY: (Calls on next reporter.) Yes.
Q The Governor of South Dakota flew back on Air Force One after having contact with somebody who had tested positive for the virus. Why was that allowed to happen"" Did she have contact with the President on the trip back"" And has the President continued to test negative since that interaction?
MS. MCENANY: Yes, the President is tested constantly, has tested negative, and those around him are tested as well.
Q But why -- the original question is: Why was she to allowed to fly back on Air Force One with the President, when it was known that she had had contact with somebody who had tested positive for the virus?
MS. MCENANY: Yeah, I'd have to refer you to Secret Service on that. But I'll tell you this: They take the President's health very seriously. They would never put him in a situation that would put him in harm's way.
Q And just one follow-up, please.
MS. MCENANY: Yes.
Q On executive orders, the President has set a pretty brisk pace on those this year. And as a candidate, he had been critical of President Obama's use of executive orders, but he seems to have really stepped up the pace on these. And I wanted to ask, you know, what does he find -- what is the strategy behind issuing more than one a week so far this year"" And I know he's getting ready to issue more in the coming weeks.
MS. MCENANY: Well, he will use the powers in his executive toolkit to further the agenda of the American people. That's his intent with these executive orders. And I would just note that, with regard to the DACA decision, the Supreme Court has suggested he has pretty wide discretion to act.
Yes, Jeff.
Q Hi, Kayleigh. With regard to the President's reference about the 99 percent being harmless, does the President worry at all that by downplaying the severity of the virus, that it will lead Americans to be less careful?
MS. MCENANY: The President isn't downplaying the severity of the virus. What the President is noting is that, at the height of this pandemic, we were at 2,500 deaths per day. We are now at a place where, on July 4th, there were 254; that's a tenfold decrease in mortality. On July 5th, 209 individuals, down 23 percent from last Sunday and the lowest Sunday since March 28th.
The President has made clear: We grieve when just one life is lost, but he wants to note the progress that we've made in treating this very serious virus when we have therapeutics like convalescent plasma, remdesivir, dexamethasone. Convalescent plasma, in particular, was spearheaded by this administration.
He's used -- he's pulled down bureaucracy and allowed us to get to a place where we can have this declining mortality rate.
Q And just to follow up on the NASCAR thing: You were saying that we're taking the tweet out of context, but this is what he tweeted. He says, ""Has @BubbaWallace apologized to all of those great NASCAR drivers and officials who came to his aid, stood by his side, and were willing to sacrifice everything for him, only to find out that the whole thing was just another HOAX"" That and Flag decision has caused lowest ratings EVER!""
How -- how are we misinterpreting that?
MS. MCENANY: I've explained to you -- this is, I guess, the fourth attempt, but we'll try it again -- in aggregate, what he was pointing out is this rush to judgment to immediately say that there is a hate crime, as happened in this case, as happened with Jussie Smollett, as happened with the Covington Catholic boys. In an aggregate, those actions made it seem like NASCAR men and women were racist individuals who were roving around and engaging in a hate crime.
The President's intent was to say, no, most American people are good, hardworking people, and we should not have this rush to judgment, kneejerk reaction before the facts come out. The FBI did their job and determined there was no hate crime.
Mario.
Q Is the President comparing Smollett to Wallace?
Q Hold on. Hold on. Just that one thing it wasn't clear in your response -- and that's why I asked about it again, and it follows up on Paula's question -- is: Why should Mr. Wallace have to apologize for that when his whole team and all of these colleagues came around him to show support?
MS. MCENANY: Yeah, and that's the best of America, is coming around when the media alleged a hate crime; coming around and supporting Bubba Wallace as they should have done. I think that shows how loving NASCAR fans are and the fellow drivers.
But I think it's important that we point out the fact that there was no hate crime; the FBI concluded that. And President Trump was merely saying that Mr. Wallace should agree with that consensus.
Yes, Mario.
Q No, he's saying he has to apologize.
MS. MCENANY: Mario, yes.
Q He's saying he has to apologize. That's what we're trying to ask you, Kayleigh, is --
MS. MCENANY: Mario, yes.
Q -- why should he have to apologize about that?
MS. MCENANY: I'm not going to answer a question a sixth time.
Mario.
Q But you haven't answered that question. I mean, you've been asked it, but you haven't answered it.
Q You haven't answered it.
MS. MCENANY: Mario, go ahead.
Q Kayleigh, on the Confederate part: Why would the President not praise NASCAR for removing the Confederate flag, particularly given the history of that flag, the symbol that it has for African Americans, and also what it represents in terms of just the treasonous acts and the insurrection against the Republic?
MS. MCENANY: So --
Q Why would he not praise them for taking that down, even if it's a ratings (inaudible)?
MS. MCENANY: The President takes great offense when Americans -- our kneejerk reaction summed up as racist. And in aggregate, the picture being painted here in this instant -- incident seemed to be that there was that suggestion there, when, in fact, what we're seeing across the nation is this vast cancel culture where we're going to tear down our monuments, we're going to tear down Gandhi, we're going to tear down George Washington, we're going to tear down Lincoln.
It's really quite appalling what we've seen happen across the country, and the President wants no part in cancel culture. He wants to no part in the tearing down and defacing of Matthias Baldwin, an abolitionist; Philadelphia Civil War soldiers; John Greenleaf Whittier vandalized, an abolitionist. He wants no part in this, and he stands against the demonization of Americans, and he stands firmly on the side of preserving our history.
Yes.
Q But, Kayleigh, the Confederate flag is a different issue.
MS. MCENANY: He's not -- I said from the very top of this briefing: He has not given an opinion one way or the other on that. I just spoke to him this morning.
Yes.
Q Kayleigh, why -- what exactly does the President see as positive or uniting then about the Confederate flag"" Why does he -- why did he decide to tweet about it then, this morning?
MS. MCENANY: The President never used those words. Those are the words of a reporter, not that of the President of the United States.
Q And, Kayleigh, to follow up --
MS. MCENANY: Yes, Phil.
Q Thank you. The President argued on Friday, and then again on Saturday, that many of the problems the country faces stem from, quote, ""extreme indoctrination and bias"" in the education system. If that's the case, is he working with Secretary DeVos to address what he sees as a major problem?
You know, what -- what steps is he taking to (inaudible) this"" And could you give us an example?
MS. MCENANY: Yeah, I'd have to inquire about that, about specific steps that he's taken. I'm not aware of his conversations with Secretary DeVos, but I will certainly follow up.
But, look, we've got a real problem in this country. When you have rioters who -- I have listed off some of the examples of abolitionists -- there seems to be zero understanding of history when you're defacing the statue of Matthias Baldwin and John Whittier and Ulysses S. Grant.
There seems to be a lack of understanding and historical knowledge when the Armenian Genocide Memorial, remembering victims of all crimes against humanity including slavery, is vandalized.
There seems to be a lack of understanding of history when the first responders sculpture is damaged, when the Polish war hero statue, the World War I Memorial, the Lincoln Memorial, the World War II Memorial, and absolutely the Robert Gould Shaw and the 54th Regiment Washington [Massachusetts] Memorial that honored African American soldiers who fought valiantly in the Civil War was damaged in Boston. We need to have a better historical understanding.
And I'll follow up with you about specific conversations.
Yes, Toluse.
Q Thank you, Kayleigh. I have question about masks. The President has, sort of, equivocated on the issue of masks, and we know that a number of Republicans are starting to say that it's the single-most important thing that Americans can do to protect each other. What is the President's message to Americans who hear those messages and say that they simply don't want to wear a mask"" What does the President say to those (inaudible)?
MS. MCENANY: Well, the President was very clear last week that if he were in a situation where he wasn't tested daily and he was in close proximity and unable to social distance, that he would wear a mask. So he has made that clear. At his rally this weekend in New Hampshire, masks are not only handed out but they are recommended.
Yes.
Q Thank you, Kayleigh. I wanted to say, first off, point of fact: Bubba Wallace did not make any kind of false report. And I'm wondering, in general, why the President thinks that issue is worth his time and focus right now in the midst of a deadly pandemic"" And then also, you've said he has no opinion on the Confederate flag. Why can't this White House unambiguously state whether or not it supports displays of the Confederate flag and --
MS. MCENANY: No, I said --
Q -- Confederate monuments, which are much more --
MS. MCENANY: I said in his --
Q -- a part of this question than Gandhi?
MS. MCENANY: Yeah, I said that, you know, he was -- his tweet was not to indicate approval or disapproval of that particular policy of NASCAR. It was in aggregate to stand against the rush to judgment to call something a hate crime before the facts were out, when clearly the media was wrong about this, when clearly --
Q But you said Bubba Wallace made a false report; he didn't.
MS. MCENANY: I never said that. Perhaps one of the reporters said that, but I certainly did not.
But he believes that we should be -- that the truth matters and that the truth was: The FBI did a thorough investigation, and what was concluded -- that there was no hate crime here. And we should all be grateful for that; grateful that NASCAR fans came together in a great display of American unity around Mr. Wallace. But then we should also be equally unequivocal about the truth of this situation here and that most Americans are great, hardworking people.
Yes.
Q But why is this cultural stuff worth his time and --
MS. MCENANY: Yes.
Q -- focus during the pandemic?
MS. MCENANY: Yes, he's focused on two things at once, something we're all capable of doing.
Q And what about on an unambiguous statement on the Confederate flag"" Are we capable of doing that?
MS. MCENANY: Look, the President has made clear he was not taking a position one way or the other in that tweet.
Q Exactly. But why not?
MS. MCENANY: Yes. Yes.
Q Thanks, Kayleigh. Two quick questions, if I may. Does the President support the Cleveland Indians and the football team here in Washington considering changing their names?
MS. MCENANY: I haven't spoken to the President on that.
Q And the other question: Who came up with the list of historical figures that the President wants honored in his -- in his garden of statues that he put out this executive order about"" Who came up with the list of people to be included?
MS. MCENANY: So, I don't know exactly who came up with that list. I can ask about it, but it's a pretty extraordinary list of people. I think we can all agree on the fact that great American heroes are people like Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass and Booker T. Washington and Martin Luther King, Jr. -- these are incredible men and women in our history -- Susan B. Anthony and Billy Graham. So I think we can all pretty much widely acknowledge that these are American heroes.
Yes.
Q Thank you, Kayleigh. The President signed the Payroll Protection Program extension over the weekend. There's $132 billion in the pot. What does the President think that that money should be used for if it's still there after August 8th"" And then, in a CARES 4, specifically, what should be there to help small businesses?
MS. MCENANY: Yeah, so I don't have any updates on phase four. I've mentioned that the payroll tax is something of great interest to the President because it would help low -- low- and middle-income Americans most. PPP funding -- they've done an extraordinary job with that. Small businesses across the country have gotten this, and we've kept people on payroll. So he's very pleased with the progress that's been made there and the continuing functioning of the PPP.
Yes.
Q Would he veto a bill then that did not have the payroll tax relief in it?
MS. MCENANY: Yeah, I don't want to set parameters or conditions. That'll be up to the President when the bill arrives on his desk.
Yes.
Q Thank you, Kayleigh, so much. As President Trump wants to reopen the country, what will be the criteria to cancel the travel bans"" Because we know that the bans are still in place for European countries where the situation is under control. And, on the other hand, there is no ban on hotspots like Russia, India, or Mexico, for example. So what is the criteria?
MS. MCENANY: Yeah, so I don't have specific criteria to give you. I'd have to refer you to the State Department and Secretary Pompeo, and his remarks on the topic during his last press conference, as where we currently stand.
But President Trump and the administration have taken bold, decisive, and frequent action to secure our homeland, and a big part of that has been these travel restrictions. And we're working with countries around the world, and we hope to have a day where international travel is open. But right now, this is about putting America first.
And I want to say this --
Q Kayleigh, can I ask one more question?
MS. MCENANY: Yes.
Q European countries, and now the UK, are starting to open for touring visitors, but the U.S. is still banned. How do you think the world is looking at the United States right now?
MS. MCENANY: I think the world is looking at us as a leader in COVID-19, because the chart I showed you, where you have mortality rate -- and Italy and UK up here and across Europe, and you have the United States at a low case mortality rate -- it's because of the extraordinary work that we've done on therapeutics and getting PPE and leading on ventilators and having excess ventilators that we were able to deploy around the world and help other countries. So that's what I would have to say on COVID.
And finally, I'd end with this: You know, I was asked probably 12 questions about the Confederate flag. This President is focused on action, and I'm a little dismayed that I didn't receive one question on the deaths that we got in this country this weekend. I didn't receive one question about New York City shootings doubling for the third straight week. And over the last seven days, shootings skyrocketed by 142 percent. Not one question. I didn't receive one question about five children who were killed.
And I'll leave you with this remark by a dad -- it broke my heart -- a dad of an eight-year-old lost in Atlanta this weekend: ""They say black lives matter...you killed a child. She didn't do nothing to nobody,"" was his quote.
We need to be focused on securing our streets, making sure no lives are lost because all black lives matter -- that of David Dorn and that of this eight-year-old girl.
Thank you.

Racine Leads 20-State Coalition Urging Facebook to Aggressively Combat the Spread of Hate and Disinformation Online",FALSE,"District of Columbia Attorney General Karl A. Racine issued the following news release on Aug. 5:
Attorney General Karl A. Racine, New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal, and Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul today co-led a coalition of 20 state Attorneys General calling on Facebook, Inc. (Facebook), to adopt additional preventive measures against the spread of hate and disinformation on its platform. In a letter to Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, the Attorneys General assert that ""[p]rivate parties, organized groups and public officials continue to use Facebook to spread misinformation and project messages of hate against different groups of Americans,"" leading to abuse of individual Facebook users. The letter cites the findings from Facebook's own internal audit indicating that the company has refused to enforce its own policies against dangerous organizations and individuals, including white supremacists and other extremists. In response, the Attorneys General urge Facebook to ""strengthen its commitment to civil rights and fighting disinformation and discrimination"" and to offer greater support for users who fall victim to online intimidation and harassment.
""Facebook has a responsibility to protect hundreds of thousands of District residents--and, indeed, millions of Americans--from hate and harassment while interacting on the company's online platforms,"" said AG Racine. ""Our coalition of state Attorneys General are calling on Facebook to not only meet the commitments it has already laid out for itself, but to step up its guard against the spread of extremism online.""
Facebook, headquartered in Menlo Park, California, is a digital social networking service with more than 2 billion active users around the world--including 250 million Americans, and hundreds of thousands of District residents. Through a website and a mobile application, Facebook allows users to communicate and share content with personalized networks of ""friends.""
Recent surveys suggest more than 40 percent of Americans have experienced some form of online harassment, and that of those victims, more than 75 percent have reported being harassed on Facebook. The Attorneys General observe in their letter that much of the harassment reported by Facebook users focuses on characteristics protected by civil rights laws, including race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender and gender identity, and disability. Such harassment can include cyberstalking, maliciously publishing someone's personal information, or filing false police reports targeting the victim. The letter contends that at present, ""recourse is unavailable for too many of these victims,"" due to factors including insufficient, limited services offered to victims by Facebook.
The Attorneys General acknowledge that ""Facebook has--on occasion--taken action to address violations of its terms of service in cases where we have helped elevate our constituents' concerns."" But they further emphasize that many Facebook users continue to find the redress process ""slow, frustrating, and ineffective.""
Recommendations for Facebook
The reforms recommended in today's letter, many of which are highlighted in the company's recent civil rights audit, include calls for Facebook to:
Aggressively enforce policies against hate speech and extremist organizations: The audit found that while Facebook already has policies on the books to prevent the spread of hate speech, the company neglects to fully enforce these policies. The Attorneys General call on the company to follow through on its commitment to uphold its policies. Further, the Attorneys General urge the company to expand its policies in order to limit inflammatory advertisements that vilify minority groups.
Allow public, third-party audits of hate content and enforcement to guide best practices: The Attorneys General recommend the company open itself up to additional audit efforts, in the vein of the civil rights audit. Further, they advise the company to accept ongoing, independent analysis of the platform's content population scheme, and follow suggested best practices determined from these efforts.
Enhance supportive services for users targeted by hateful or harassing content: The Attorneys General encourage Facebook to offer live, real-time assistance to victims of intimidation and harassment on the platform, make information about unlawful harassment and intimidation more readily available to users, and strengthen users' ability to filter, report, and block malicious content.
AG Racine co-led this letter with New Jersey Attorney General Grewal and Illinois Attorney General Raoul. They were joined by the Attorneys General of California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, Vermont and Wisconsin.

To: Mark Zuckerberg, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Sheryl Sandberg, Chief Operating Officer, Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, California 94025
Dear Mr. Zuckerberg & Ms. Sandberg:
We, the undersigned State Attorneys General, write to request that you take additional steps to prevent Facebook from being used to spread disinformation and hate and to facilitate discrimination. We also ask that you take more steps to provide redress for users who fall victim to intimidation and harassment, including violence and digital abuse.
Our nation is in the midst of a reckoning on issues of racial justice and civil rights. As State Attorneys General, we have witnessed firsthand how the country's longstanding undercurrent of discrimination has burst into the open, as reports of hate crimes and bias incidents of all kinds have dramatically increased in recent years./1 And while recent events have further highlighted the systemic injustice that persists in our society, the last few months also have seen millions of Americans join together to call for action against bias and racism.
As you know, Facebook is not immune to these problems. Although Facebook has made some progress in counteracting the use of its platform to dehumanize and demean, that is just the beginning of what is necessary./2 Private parties, organized groups, and public officials continue to use Facebook to spread misinformation and project messages of hate against different groups of Americans. In many cases, these messages lead to intimidation and harassment of particular individuals online.
According to recent surveys, more than forty percent of Americans have experienced some form of online harassment, including cyberstalking, doxing (maliciously publishing someone's personal information), and swatting (filing false police reports to prompt a law enforcement response targeting the victim)./3 Of those Americans who report having been harassed online, more than three-quarters have reported being harassed on Facebook./4 Much of that harassment is focused on characteristics protected by the civil rights laws that many of us are charged with enforcing, including race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender and gender identity, and disability./5 Recourse is unavailable for too many of these victims, due to limitations on the services that Facebook offers victims and other impediments to securing relief through civil lawsuits or criminal prosecutions.
We understand that Facebook has committed to the public and its users that it will ""invest billions of dollars each year to keep [Facebook's] community safe and continuously work with outside experts to review and update [Facebook's] policies.""/6 But, as the most recent Civil Rights Audit reveals, the steps you have taken thus far have fallen short. With the vast resources at your disposal, we believe there is much more that you can do to prevent the use of Facebook as a vehicle for misinformation and discrimination, and to prevent your users from being victimized by harassment and intimidation on your platforms.
As State Attorneys General, we are responsible for protecting the safety and wellbeing of all the communities we serve. As part of that mission, we must constantly contend with the impacts of online hate, intimidation, and harassment. Many of our offices enforce the laws that protect our residents from bias offenses, intimidation, and harassment--whether online or on our streets./7 And many of our offices include units dedicated to serving the victims of unlawful conduct, including helping them access and use tools that allow them to vindicate their rights. As part of our responsibilities to our communities, Attorneys General have helped residents navigate Facebook's processes for victims to address abuse on its platform. While Facebook has--on occasion--taken action to address violations of its terms of service in cases where we have helped elevate our constituents' concerns,/8 we know that everyday users of Facebook can find the process slow, frustrating, and ineffective. Thus, we write to highlight positive steps that Facebook can take to strengthen its policies and practices. We hope to work with you to ensure that fewer individuals suffer online harassment and discrimination, and that it is quickly and effectively addressed when they do.
Based on our collective experience, we believe that Facebook should take additional actions including the following steps--many of which are highlighted in Facebook's recent Civil Rights Audit--to strengthen its commitment to civil rights and fighting disinformation and discrimination:
* Aggressively enforce Facebook policies against hate speech and organized hate organizations: Although Facebook has developed policies against hate speech and organizations that peddle it, we remain concerned that Facebook's policies on Dangerous Individuals and Organizations, including but not limited to its policies on white nationalist and white supremacist content, are not enforced quickly and comprehensively enough./9 Content that violates Facebook's own policies too often escapes removal just because it comes as coded language, rather than specific magic words. And even where Facebook takes steps to address a particular violation, it often fails to proactively address the follow-on actions by replacement or splinter groups that quickly emerge.
* Allow public, third-party audits of hate content and enforcement: To gauge the ongoing progress of Facebook's enforcement efforts, independent experts should be permitted access to the data necessary to conduct regular, transparent third-party audits of hate and hate-related misinformation on the platform, including any information made available to the Global Oversight Board. As part of this effort, Facebook should capture data on the prevalence of different forms of hate content on the platform, whether or not covered by Facebook's own community standards, thus allowing the public to determine whether enforcement of anti-hate policies differs based on the type of hate content at issue.
* Commit to an ongoing, independent analysis of Facebook's content population scheme and the prompt development of best practices guidance: By funneling users toward particular types of content, Facebook's content population scheme, including its algorithms, can push users into extremist online communities that feature divisive and inflammatory messages, often directed at particular groups. Although Facebook has conducted research and considered programs to reduce this risk, there is still no mandatory guidance for coders and other teams involved in content population. Facebook should commit to an ongoing, independent analysis of its content population scheme, including its algorithms, and also continuously implement mandatory protocols as best practices are identified to curb bias and prevent recommendations of hate content and groups.
* Expand policies limiting inflammatory advertisements that vilify minority groups: Although Facebook currently prohibits ads that claim that certain people, because of their membership in a protected group, pose a threat to the physical safety of communities or the nation, its policies still allow attacks that characterize such groups as threats to national culture or values.10 The current prohibition should be expanded to include such ads.
We also recommend the following measures to improve the supportive services that Facebook offers to users who have been or may become victims of harassment and intimidation on its platforms:
* Offer live real-time assistance: Facebook users can report intimidation and harassment but cannot immediately engage a Facebook employee who can promptly address issues that are occurring in real time. Victims of intimidation and harassment would benefit from more immediate access to Facebook employees who can offer prompt assistance. For example, if a user is being doxed, live assistance could help stop the spread of the user's personal information before the damage cannot be undone.
* Make information about harassment and intimidation more readily available: Facebook should facilitate evidence preservation and cooperate with victims and law enforcement agencies seeking evidence to prove a case of harassment or intimidation, such as cyberstalking or non-consensual distribution of intimate imagery, when the offenders use Facebook to perpetrate their crimes.
* Strengthen filtering, reporting, and blocking tools: Facebook allows users to block individual people, but users should have stronger tools and more choices for filtering out and reporting hateful, intimidating, and harassing content they do not want to see in their feeds. For example, if members of a Facebook group are engaged in an organized campaign of harassment against a single user, the victim should be able to block all members of the group and report batches of posts or users without having to block or report each individually.
We urge Facebook to take these steps to better tackle hate in our society, and address the interests of users who are victimized by others in the online community that Facebook has built.

to make it live again, we need the patrons back in. From its sepia beginnings to its modern makeover, the Regent has stood here for nearly 90 years, and will reopen fully next month, somewhere to escape life's dramas for a darkened moment of make-believe and dreams. Duncan Kennedy, BBC News, in Christchurch. The Beatles legend John Lennon would have turned 80 years old today. 
He was murdered in New York 40 years ago, but his legacy as one of the 20th century's great cultural icons lives on. There are a number of events to mark the occasion, including the display of the piano on which he wrote Imagine at Liverpool's Strawberry Fields near his childhood home. Time for a look at the weather. Here's Sarah Keith-Lucas. We have had some blue sky, a bit of sunshine out there so far today, but also plenty of heavy downpour. So scenes like this one for many of us, this is the picture in Cumbria taken a little while ago by one of our Weather Watchers. And that theme stays with us for the next few days. The weather is taking a bit of a colder time, and we will continue to see blustery showers with a bit of sunshine in between those showers, too. We have high pressure setting out towards the west, low-pressure to the north-east of UK, and that combination is drawing in the breeze from a north-westerly direction, bringing plenty more showers through the rest of today. We've got a line of cloud and rain. This is a frontal system moving across south-east England and East Anglia. The rest of the UK, sunny spells and pretty frequent showers. Quite blustery conditions particularly in and around the showers, and there could be the occasional rumble of thunder and perhaps a bit of hail as well. Temperatures in the northern half of the UK around ten to 12 Celsius, for the south 14 perhaps 16 for the warmest spots. But yesterday we were up to 19 Celsius, such as turning a bit cooler now. Losing the rain from the south-east tonight, so tonight some clear spells for southern and eastern parts, but more heavy showers rattling in across Scotland, Northern Ireland, and northern England as well. So shower here from the word go to start Saturday morning. It's fairly similar to what we have out there today tomorrow in that we have high pressure to the west, low pressure to the east. Again the breeze coming in from quite a cool north-westerly direction, quite a lot of isobars on the map as you can see as well. After a choice that in the south, some sunshine for the morning, there will be more showers working in through the day. Some of these showers, if you do catch one, could be heavy and thundery once again. Some hill mixed in, but some sunshine in between the showers as well. Temperatures and weigh around 11 Celsius on the east Coast with it will feel quite breezy. Into Sunday, for most of us looking at the better day of the weekend. Some drier weather, a little less breezy than Saturday. Still a brisk breeze around that East Coast, but it will be quite cool with the odd shower around, too, but many places avoiding the showers on Sunday. Around 11 to 15 Celsius. Looking ahead to next week, the return of low pressure from the Atlantic. This area of low pressure moves south-east across the UK, probably sitting central parts of continental Europe, and that will bring more showers through next week across parts of England and Wales in particular. We should see some drier and some slightly brighter weather for Scotland and for Northern Ireland into next week. But for most of us, a fairly unsettled and quite and autumnal output. A reminder of our top story - the UK economic recovery slowed sharply in August - despite the government's Eat Out to Help Out scheme aimed at boosting restaurants. The economy grew by 2.1% in August, but remains 9.2% smaller than when the coronavirus pandemic began. That's all from the BBC News at One, so it's goodbye from me, and on BBC One, we now join the BBC's news teams where you are. Good afternoon. I'm Sonja Jessup. There's been a rise in homophobic hate crime in London. 888 New figures obtained by the BBC show the number of reports to the Met Police almost doubled from last year to more than 3,000. Our LGBT Correspondent, Ben Hunte, has been talking to one man who was attacked two years ago after London's Pride parade. Many people would think that the UK is a great place to be lesbian, gay or bisexual in 2020. However, I have been investigating homophobic hate crimes across the UK and I've discovered that reports have nearly tripled in five years, with a 20% increase since last year. Whilst police say this is partly better reporting, LGBT charities have seen a real increase in attacks against gay and bi people. Through Freedom of Information requests, I asked police forces across the UK how many hate crimes they'd recorded based on sexual orientation over the past five years. They've nearly tripled, a 177% increase."

NEW YORK — At a special online event, Secretary General of the Muslim World League (MWL) Sheikh Dr. Mohammed Al-Issa was honored with an inaugural award for his contribution towards fighting anti-Semitism. He is the first recipient of the prestigious annual award given by the Combat Anti-Semitism Movement and American Sephardi Federation, to Muslim leaders engaged in the fight against Anti-Semitism.
Sheikh Dr. Al-Issa was recognized for uniting people of all faiths, publicly condemning Holocaust denial and for inspiring the next generation to tackle hate and promote peace.
In a special address at the event, titled ""How Muslims and Jews Can Combat Anti-Semitism Together,"" Sheikh Dr. Al-Issa spoke passionately about the need for unity in order to overcome anti-Semitism and hatred. Additional speakers at Tuesday's event included Elan Carr (US Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism), Sam Brownback (US Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom) and Ahmed Shaheed (UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Belief and Religion).
Sheikh Dr. Al-Issa has consistently provided a powerful voice against extremist ideology and is considered the leading global voice for moderate Islam across the Sunni world. He has frequently condemned Holocaust denial, acts of anti-Semitism and the extremist distortion of religion. In January, he led the Muslim World League on a historic visit of senior Muslim leaders to the Auschwitz-Birkenau Concentration Camp.
Speaking from Saudi Arabia, Sheikh Dr. Al-Issa encouraged communities to work together, saying, ""Whereas Jews and Muslims lived centuries together, in these last decades we have sadly grown apart. Now, we must rebuild the bridges of dialogue and the bonds of partnership between our communities... Since taking over the Muslim World League, it has been my mission to fight the forces of hatred and violence.
""Earlier this year, our efforts in particular to shatter the ideology of anti-Semitism culminated in a visit to the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp, where I stood united alongside my Jewish brothers and said: Never again. Not for Jews, not for Muslims, not for Christians, not for Hindus, not for Sikhs. Not for any of God's Children. History's greatest horror, the Holocaust, must never be repeated.""
Sheikh Dr. Al-Issa reiterated his firm condemnation of Holocaust denial, saying, ""There are those who still try to falsify history. Who claim the Holocaust, the most despicable crime in human history, is fiction. We stand against these liars, no matter who they are or where they come from...True Islam deems any attempt to deny or underplay the brutal horrors of the Holocaust as the ultimate insult to the dignity of all those who perished.""
He also condemned those using the current coronavirus pandemic to leverage hate, saying, ""Today, we all face a common enemy in the form of the coronavirus. It has spread to every corner of the globe, showing us that it does not care if a person is Muslim or non-Muslim, Jew or non-Jew, rich or poor, educated or non-educated... Especially during times of economic challenge and social isolation, the danger of communities turning inward and rejecting the other is even greater. And we know that extremists of all type are seeking to exploit the current uncertainty to push an ideology of hatred and division.""
Sheikh Dr. Al -Issa condemned hate crimes across the world, including anti-Semitic attacks, saying, ""Your community has tragically been the target of several terrorist attacks — in Pittsburgh; in San Diego; in Munsey, New York; in Halle, Germany. I condemned each and every one of these horrible assaults upon humanity. As if they were attacks on Muslims.""
He concluded by saying that the Muslim World League is ""ready for the fight"" against ""the scourge of Islamophobia and anti-Semitism and all hatred,"" adding, ""We in the Muslim World League are proud to should to shoulder with our Jewish brothers and sisters to build understanding, respect, love and interreligious harmony.""
Sacha Roytman-Dratwa, Combat Anti-Semitism Movement director, commented, ""Anti-Semitism can only be defeated by working together. Sheikh Dr. Mohammed Al-Issa is a unique and important voice in this struggle. I hope that his strong commitment to the issue will encourage more and more Muslim voices to be heard against the hatred of Jews. At a time when Iran's spiritual leader calls for the destruction of the Jewish state, the Sheikh's statements condemning the hatred of Jews are of particular importance, especially given the scrutiny he often faces.""
Jason Guberman. executive director at American Sephardi Federation commented, ""We are proud to honor our friend, the Muslim World League's Secretary General, Sheikh Dr. Mohammed Al-Issa, for his commitment, courage, and creativity countering Anti-Semitism as well as fighting against all forms of hate, bigotry, and fanaticism. His moral courage is matched by his boundless intellectual curiosity and willingness to confront controversies directly.""
US Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom Sam Brownback said, ""If we can get the three Abrahamic faiths to work together not just in tolerance, but in love, respect and care for each other, we would reduce so much hatred and violence. This would ripple throughout out the world in such a positive way. We have to overcome the forces of evil, but we can only do it if we work together.""
US Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism Elan Carr said, ""The only question for leaders today, is what kind of Middle East are we going to choose? A Middle East of terror and exclusion, or a Middle East of inclusion? Sheikh Al-Issa has chosen a future of tolerance and affection, where Jews and Christians can be embraced by their Muslim brethren.""
UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief Dr. Ahmed Shaheed commented on the urgency of tackling anti-Semitism, especially in the Muslim world. He commented, ""We have Muslim leaders, like former Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia or the Supreme Leader Khamenei of Iran who have promoted or are actively promoting anti-Semitism... Muslims and Jews have much in common, in religion, in history, and in culture. It is politics, feeding off ignorance, that divides us.""
The Combat Anti-Semitism Movement (CAM) is a non-partisan, global grassroots movement of individuals and organizations, across all religions and faiths, united around the goal of ending anti-Semitism in all its forms. Since its launching in February 2019, 245 organizations and 245,000 individuals have joined the Combat Anti-Semitism Movement by signing the campaign's pledge. The CAM Pledge draws upon the IHRA international definition of anti- Semitism and its list of specific behaviors used to discriminate against the Jewish people and Israel. — SG

Today is Wednesday, Aug. 12, the 225th day of 2020. There are 141 days left in the year.
Today’s Highlight in History:
On August 12, 2017, a car plowed into a crowd of people peacefully protesting a white nationalist rally in the Virginia college town of Charlottesville, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and hurting more than a dozen others. (The attacker, James Alex Fields, was sentenced to life in prison on 29 federal hate crime charges, and life plus 419 years on state charges.) President Donald Trump condemned what he called an “egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.”
On this date:
In 1867, President Andrew Johnson sparked a move to impeach him as he defied Congress by suspending Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, with whom he had clashed over Reconstruction policies. (Johnson was acquitted by the Senate.)
In 1902, International Harvester Co. was formed by a merger of McCormick Harvesting Machine Co., Deering Harvester Co. and several other manufacturers.
In 1909, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, home to the Indianapolis 500, first opened.
In 1939, the MGM movie musical “The Wizard of Oz,” starring Judy Garland, had its world premiere at the Strand Theater in Oconomowoc (oh-KAH’-noh-moh-wahk), Wisconsin, three days before opening in Hollywood.
In 1944, during World War II, Joseph P. Kennedy Jr., eldest son of Joseph and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, was killed with his co-pilot when their explosives-laden Navy plane blew up over England.
In 1953, the Soviet Union conducted a secret test of its first hydrogen bomb.
In 1981, IBM introduced its first personal computer, the model 5150, at a press conference in New York.
In 1985, the world’s worst single-aircraft disaster occurred as a crippled Japan Airlines Boeing 747 on a domestic flight crashed into a mountain, killing 520 people. (Four people survived.)
In 2000, the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk and its 118-man crew were lost during naval exercises in the Barents Sea.
In 2004, New Jersey Gov. James E. McGreevey announced his resignation and acknowledged that he’d had an extramarital affair with another man.
In 2009, guitar virtuoso Les Paul died in White Plains, New York, at 94.
In 2013, James “Whitey” Bulger, the feared Boston mob boss who became one of the nation’s most-wanted fugitives, was convicted in a string of 11 killings and dozens of other gangland crimes, many of them committed while he was said to be an FBI informant. (Bulger was sentenced to life; he was fatally beaten at a West Virginia prison in 2018, hours after being transferred from a facility in Florida.)
Ten years ago: General Motors Co. chief Ed Whitacre announced he was stepping down as CEO on September 1, 2010, saying his mission was accomplished as the company reported its second straight quarterly profit. (Whitacre was succeeded as CEO by GM board member Daniel Akerson.)
Five years ago: Islamic State sympathizers circulated an image that appeared to show the body of a Croatian hostage abducted in Egypt, the first such killing of a foreign captive since the extremist group established a branch in the Arab country. Deadly warehouse blasts in the Chinese port city of Tianjin claimed 165 lives. Former President Jimmy Carter announced he had been diagnosed with cancer following recent liver surgery.
One year ago: A whistleblower complaint bearing this date stated: “In the course of my official duties, I have received information from multiple U.S. Government officials that the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.” (The complaint was addressed to Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence; it did not reach them until Sept. 25.) The Trump administration said it was moving ahead with one of its most aggressive steps to restrict legal immigration: denying green cards to many migrants who use Medicaid, food stamps, housing vouchers or other forms of public assistance.

TEXT: CUOMO PRIME TIME.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
C. CUOMO: California, Texas, and Florida, the three most populous States in our country are now bursting with COVID cases, thousands of new infections being reported every day. The crisis is getting worse in this country in at least 23 other States.
Turns out the virus didn't take a summer break, just as we were warned.
Now, you will not hear the President, and I argue, any Republican leader within his earshot, say any of what I just told you. And it is all facts. But here's the truth that we have to now accept.
Masks matter. The resistance to masks is stupid politics, even worse, a symptom of a cancerous political culture that's making us even more sick than COVID.
Denial is not a strategy for dealing with the pandemic. You know who said that? The Governor of New York. One of the three States originally hit hardest, remember? New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, those epicenters, went from Oregon, Washington, California, then here.
But now, those three States on the East Coast are reporting the lowest numbers of infection rates. What did they get right that isn't happening in the States that are now in crisis? And those three States also have a big announcement all over the news today.
New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut are jointly declaring restrictions for travelers, a 14-day quarantine for those coming to those three States from the eight States with the highest infection rates.
Now, this is going to be controversial. Why is it the best way to keep numbers down? Joining us now with answers is the Governor of New York, my big brother, Andrew Cuomo.
How are you doing, Guv?
GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): Good thing you gave me credit for that ""Denial is not a life strategy."" I was going to come right through that camera if you tried to steal that line.
C. CUOMO: Well I changed it a little. You did say ""Denial is not a strategy for life."" You've told me that many times. But I continue to do it. And I--
A. CUOMO: OK.
C. CUOMO: --just expanded it to pandemic.
So, here is the question for you. What do you now know for sure, from your experience in your State that you have to do, in order to get cases down that isn't being done in these cases where they're popping?
A. CUOMO: Yes, look, and you're right. And we talked about this early on, and you had the right questions. You didn't have the answers. But you're not in the answer business. I am.
There were two theories that were posed to this nation.
The President said basically, ""Don't worry about COVID,"" the denial strategy. It was inconvenient. It got in the way of his economic story. So, ""It was just the flu. It was going to disappear. Don't worry about it. Liberate the States. Liberate New York. It's all about the economy."" That was option ""A.""
Option ""B"" was the course that we took here in New York, that it's not a political issue. This is a virus. And there's no political strategy to deal with the virus. It's not Democratic. It's not Republican.
And you have to use the science, and you have to use data, and you have to use metrics, and you have to do the testing. And there is no choice between a public health strategy and an economic strategy. Either you do both or you do neither. And I'm not going to sacrifice life for the economy. And it wouldn't work anyway.
Those were the two theories. We tested them, Christopher. You have some States who followed the President's thinking. And you have New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and some other States that did a science-based reopening. Science-based reopening worked.
You had to withstand the political pressure, you're right. But people stood up and they did it.
And look what you see now. You see 27 States that are going up with the viral transmission. You see the Dow Jones going down, why, because if you didn't take care of the virus, you're not going to have the economy come back.
And now that you started this reopening, and people see the virus going up, it's shaking the economy even worse than if you had started more gradually, but that the market could have confidence in what you were doing.
C. CUOMO: The two excuses--
A. CUOMO: So, New York took a very different track.
C. CUOMO: The two excuses--
A. CUOMO: Go ahead.
C. CUOMO: --that will be offered up, as a counter to the argument, is one is, ""Look, this was always going to happen. New York got hit first, and then it was going to move around the rest of the country. That's all this is.
[21:05:00]
And the only reason that these cases are coming up is because we're testing so much, and this is really just a false alarm put out by Cuomo and others who want to hurt the President. It's just more testing.""
A. CUOMO: Yes.
C. CUOMO: ""Test less.""
A. CUOMO: Right.
C. CUOMO: ""And you'll be fine.""
A. CUOMO: I got it. Yes. Good. Except it's factually bogus, right? You can say whatever you want to say, but it's bogus.
First, on the testing argument, that's what they're saying. ""We're getting more cases because we're doing more testing."" Oh, really? Then how come more people are walking into the hospital? What does it mean when you walk into the hospital except you are sick? All right, forget the testing numbers. Hospitalizations are going up. ICU beds are going up. You have hospitals that are near capacity now. How do you explain that, but that more people are getting sick, right? So, it just - it makes no sense on its face.
Second, the argument about New York, we had a much worse hand than anybody else was dealt.
C. CUOMO: Why?
A. CUOMO: Remember what they did to New York. Because the Federal Government, back when this started, January, February, March, they were saying ""It's coming from China. It's coming from China. It's coming from China.""
No, Federal Government. You were too slow. It left China. It went to Europe. Nobody even saw it get to Europe. And then it came to New York from Europe.
January, February, March, 3 million people on flights from Europe landing in JFK. They brought that virus here. It took off like fire through dry grass. They did the European travel ban March 16th. It had already been here for months.
Our numbers went through the roof, not because it was endemic to New York, or our water, or our air, or our accent, but because it came from Europe and the Federal Government missed it.
We had to turn the curve. These other States, all they had to do was stop it from going up, when in New York, it was already up, Chris. We had to bend the curve. And God bless the people of New York. You're talking about masks now? We did that, two months ago.
New Yorkers heard the facts. They believed in government. They believed in the State government. They rallied together. They were community. They were together. It was beautiful.
C. CUOMO: You came on the show with a mask on, early on.
A. CUOMO: And they did what no other State in this country--
C. CUOMO: Do you remember that?
A. CUOMO: Well that was to cover my nose. That - that was different. That was different.
C. CUOMO: That would have been a hell of a mask.
A. CUOMO: But yes, we were way ahead of the curve.
C. CUOMO: But you came on. You were making it, even when people were saying, ""Mask, oh, very controversial.""
So now, you have the three States coming together, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut. There's been a lot of sharing of information and of responsibility. And now the move is making all these headlines, quarantine.
The eight States that you three Governors believe are not doing what they need to do. You're not going to let them expose your States to risk. They're going to have to have a 14-day quarantine, if they come to you.
Now, why is that a good policy, in light of the fact that when people were threatening to do that to you guys, early on, you didn't like it? You thought it was wrong, and you said, ""I'm not going to close my borders.""
A. CUOMO: Yes. Not to correct you on the facts, because it's your show and they're your facts.
C. CUOMO: But?
A. CUOMO: Your opinion.
But there are still facts. First, the Federal Government wanted to blockade New York, OK? Federal blockade hasn't been done since the Civil War.
They were talking about closing bridges, and tunnels, and saying ""You cannot leave New York and you cannot enter New York."" That was illegal. It was unconstitutional. And I said that would start another Civil War.
States do have authority over their public health, and they can quarantine. What we're saying in New York now, and also Governor Murphy in New Jersey, and Governor Lamont in Connecticut, look, we fought like heck to get our infection rate down.
We have the lowest infection rate, Christopher, in the United States of America. We went from the highest infection rate in the country to the lowest transmission rate.
C. CUOMO: And you don't think that's just time?
A. CUOMO: New Yorkers killed themselves to do that.
C. CUOMO: Because people will say ""Oh, it's herd immunity.""
A. CUOMO: Well no, of course not time.
C. CUOMO: ""It moved its way through.""
A. CUOMO: Yes. But they'd be wrong. There is no herd immunity. Herd immunity is 50 percent, 60 percent, 70 percent infection rate. We're nowhere near that. Highest we got was about 22 percent.
No, it's not time. You just let it go, it will continue to increase. That's what you saw in New York in that whole first phase. We shot up to 18,000 cases over 60 days. This thing communicates and transmits like no one's business.
No. If you don't get ahead of it - the only one that tried herd immunity was Sweden.
C. CUOMO: Yes.
A. CUOMO: And then they said, ""Whoops! That was a mistake.""
C. CUOMO: Yes. Fair point.
A. CUOMO: No. It's because we got control - we got control of it. So, we don't want to go backwards.
[21:10:00]
So, we have to, one, make sure that we stay diligent, and the local governments do the compliance, et cetera. But two, we don't want people coming here, bringing the virus. All you need is one ""Super spreader."" New Rochelle, one person infected hundreds. And a lot of people come to New York and the Tri-state area from other places. We just want to make sure we don't import the virus, because we learned that lesson, been there, done that, when the Federal Government failed to tell us that the virus was coming from Europe.
C. CUOMO: How confident are you--
A. CUOMO: That's what we're saying--
C. CUOMO: --that the United States didn't have to be in the position it is of having the most cases, of being so far behind other countries that are, frankly, not as developed as the United States, in terms of public health, or resources?
How confident are you that we did not have to be in the position we are in right now?
A. CUOMO: It's - it's not a question of belief. It's not a question of politics, OK? Otherwise, you fall into their trap. It's science. It's science.
Look at the numbers in New York. How did you go from the highest infection rate in the country to one of the lowest infection rates in the country? How did you do that? On the numbers, mathematically, as a matter of science, you got control of it.
We had two different messages and two different strategies. And you had half the country saying ""It's the flu. It's nothing. Don't worry about it. Today, stop testing. Testing is the problem.""
I mean, how ludicrous! People are walking into the hospital. How can you say it's testing? It is denial. It's a failure of leadership. It's all political.
He - the President wants to run on the economy. He thinks this is a problem for the economy. He actually created a problem for the economy, because the markets have no confidence that he is in control of this virus. And that's his economic problem now.
C. CUOMO: Well and also time is poison, economically. And the longer this goes, the more - I mean I know you know this with your own budget woes in New York State. You're losing revenue. People need help. Time is a devil in this, and certainly, we've extended this beyond where we needed to.
Let me take a break.
When we come back, I want to talk to you about the challenges going forward, in terms of this feared second wave, although now, as Dr. Fauci says, ""We're not done with the first wave, so how are we going to have a second wave?""
And also the challenges for your State and this country in dealing with this search for equal justice and equal opportunity, what will New York do? Next.

(END VIDEO CLIP)
C. CUOMO: All right, we're back now with the Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo.
Good to have you, big brother.
The quarantine, 14 days, you say this is different than what they wanted to do to New York. Fair point! But the idea of enforcing this quarantine from those eight States, how do you enforce something like this?
A. CUOMO: When you land in this - they're basically South and Southwestern States. When you land in New York, you come through an airport. We know who you are. We know what flight you took. And we'll do random checks.
You can get pulled over by a police officer who could ask you questions. You could go to a meeting, and somebody could ask you, and call the Department of Health. So, there are a number of ways to enforce it.
We're not going - some States brought in the National Guard to do it. We're not going to do anything like that.
C. CUOMO: So, this is going to be a little bit of an honor system, and you're counting on people to do the right thing?
A. CUOMO: No - it's an honor system. But if you violate it, and an Inspector calls you, or shows up at your address, and you're not there, you break the law. You'll have a mandatory quarantine, and you'll pay a several thousand dollar simple penalty.
C. CUOMO: I'm saying it's going to be tough to enforce. But you can only do what you can do. I got you.
Another question. California, early on, was very aggressive. They did a lot of the things that you did in New York. Why are they still suffering?
A. CUOMO: Well, the - California started with smaller numbers, right? We started with that large spike from Europe.
They started with smaller numbers. I don't know exactly why they're seeing the continued increase that they're seeing. The - in California, it's slightly different. You have different counties with different strategies.
Los Angeles is doing one thing, San Francisco and the surrounding counties are doing something else. They're having different results, depending on the strategy. Los Angeles, I think, is driving the numbers right now.
New York, we did it differently. We had one strategy. It applied all across the State.
The local governments didn't make their own strategies, their own plans. I thought that was confusing. If you have one set of metrics that works, then everybody should live with that set of metrics, and that's what we did in New York.
C. CUOMO: Tale of Two Cities going on in this country. You have ""Trump says"" and then you have what ""Reality says,"" very often. On several different levels, we see this, so I'd like your responses to them.
When it comes to Cuomo, the President says, ""Hey, hey, don't give him so much credit. First of all, I did everything that he wanted. And that's why things went well for him in New York."" Fair?
A. CUOMO: No.
No, look, the President - first of all, his posture with COVID is fundamentally different than my posture with COVID, right? He always saw it as an inconvenient intrusion.
I thought as - I saw it as one of the greatest public health threats in modern political history. And I thought we ought to take it very seriously, and address it head-on, and stand up and tell the people the truth.
And that's exactly what I did, every day. I gave them the facts. And then I said, ""Here are the facts. You tell me what you think. Here's my opinion."" But I just told the people the truth, and I believed they would do the right thing, if they heard the truth, and they did.
I think the President's strategy was different. He wanted to minimize. He was going to market ""This is not really what it appears to be,"" and it was distortive.
It was not true. And it was counterproductive because denial is not a life strategy. And the virus is going to catch up with you. And it's catching up with 27 States right now. So, we had a fundamentally different posture.

The President did help New York. He sent the Army Corps of Engineers to build the Javits Center. Thank you very much. He sent 4,000 ventilators. Thank you very much. The Army Corps of Engineers came and helped us build alternative facilities. Thank you very much. So he - he was of assistance.
C. CUOMO: Sent the ship.
A. CUOMO: There's no doubt. Sent the U.S. Navy Ship Comfort.
C. CUOMO: Right.
A. CUOMO: Thank you very much, Mr. President.
C. CUOMO: Nursing homes, people died there. They didn't have to. It was mismanaged. And the operators have been given immunity. What do you have to say about that?
A. CUOMO: The - several statements that are not correct. But that's OK. It's your show. You say whatever you want to say.
The nursing homes were the most tragic situation. You had senior citizens. They were the most vulnerable to this COVID virus. They were in a congregate setting. And we lost lives, all across the country, in nursing homes. There is no doubt.
And we have to figure out how to do it better the next time because there will be a next time, either a second wave, or another disease. And if it is a disease that preys on the old, and the weak, it's going to go to the nursing homes and the rehab centers.
New York is one of the best cases in the nation for the number of deaths in nursing homes. The New York Times did a report, said we were 35th out of 50 States. We did a report, in the State, that we're going to issue that says we're 37 out of 50 States.
So, comparative to the other States, we did well, because it is a national crisis. But it's - it's false hope. We lost a tremendous amount of senior citizens.
In this State, about 38 percent of the deaths were senior citizens. Now, we knew that the vulnerable population was senior citizens. But we still have to find out how to do a better job if this virus comes back in a second wave. C. CUOMO: And giving the operators' immunity?
A. CUOMO: The operators have very strict laws in this State. And if they violated the law, they're going to be held fully accountable. We have an ongoing investigation now with the Department of Health and the Attorney General to make sure every operator was following the law during this crisis.
C. CUOMO: So, in terms of what we need to do going forward, you've made a good case of what works in New York.
Could work all over the country in terms of masks, and calling on communities, and being straight, and telling them the cases, and not playing with testing and contact tracing as a bad thing. More information is never bad.
How do those translate into the other virus that is attacking our country right now, which is division?
The idea of systematic racism and systematic inequality for the Black community is something you've addressed early on here. Do you believe there is any real chance for change on a national scale?
A. CUOMO: Oh, yes. Look, let's make sure we have the formula right, OK, if you want to take COVID, and you want to extrapolate to Mr. Floyd's murder.
The formula for COVID was, ""Tell the people the truth. Have a credible source that tells them the truth or develop credibility, and tell them the truth, and then social action.""
The way we're battling COVID is, ""Here are the facts. I'll give them to you every morning, but then social action. We have to do something. Testing, tracing, stay home, masks, social distancing, hand sanitizer, disinfect the trains.""
On the Mr. Floyd's murder, you have a galvanized public. In a way, I've never seen it galvanized before, and I say thank God. I said from day one, ""I stand with the protesters.""
Why did it take so long? 30 years ago, Rodney King, Amadou Diallo brutalized, Eric Garner, six years ago? I don't know. But it's here now. And it's a precious opportunity, if you have the social action.
People want change. They don't know how to make it happen, and they don't exactly know what the change is.
What we're doing in New York, because I want New York to lead the nation on this, Chris, we have 500 police departments in the State of New York. I sent them all notice.
You have nine months to come up with a plan that reinvents your Police Department as a collaborative. Local electeds, community activists, everybody sit at the table and reinvent the Police Department, so that there's trust and respect from the community to the police and vice versa. Take this moment, which is beautiful, and this is when change happens, but you need the vehicle to have the actual social action. And that's what we're going to do.
Take all these phrases, ""Defund the police! Demilitarize the police! Escalation! More visibility! More transparency! Civilian review!"" OK, what does that mean?
[21:25:00]
And let's do it community by community, because the New York City Police Department is a little different than the Albany Police Department. And every community has to come up with a Police Department that it wants, right?
The police were not sent down from heaven. They're not in the New Testament.
The Police Department is whatever Police Department the people want because they pay for it. You know, we have it a little backwards now. ""Well the police are this way and that's the way it's going to be."" No. It's going to be the way the people want it to be. They are public servants.
So, sit down, community, and put everyone at the table, work through these tough issues, but then design the Police Department you want. But you actually have to do it, so we can capitalize the moment, and actually have change, rather than just a lot of energy.
C. CUOMO: But you know that the minority communities can't do it for themselves because they don't have the power. So, how do you get the powerful to align with the interests of the un-powerful? How do you get the ""Haves"" to work with the ""Have-nots?""
Because, you know, as you've been telling me my whole life, you know, the policing is a function of high crime. High crime is a function of high poverty. High poverty is a function of low opportunity.
So, you come back to those type of things, it becomes just as much about class as it does about race in some ways. Of course, you have unique problems within the Black community and policing culture.
But how do you get the ""Haves"" on board with the ""Have-nots?""
A. CUOMO: Look, you have a moment here. I say in nine - first you need a process. I say in nine months, every local government with every Police Department, 500 in New York, sit at the table, give me a plan in nine months, as a collaborative.
C. CUOMO: Or else?
A. CUOMO: The - or else, you get no funding from the State, which is a big ""Or else.""
C. CUOMO: Yes, big ""None."" OK. A. CUOMO: So, they're going to have to do it. And then I say, ""Don't just give me a plan. You have to pass it into law, which means you have to go pass the legislative body in that local government.""
And with all, the energy, Chris, that is now generated, all that community activism, all those protesters, within nine months that energy is still going to be there.
And I want to see a legislature, in any local government, pass a new plan, redesigning their Police Department, if the community activists and that energy isn't part of the process and isn't satisfied. It's not going to happen.
C. CUOMO: Me having you on the show is an unusual thing. We've never really done it. But this was an unusual time. And they were unusual needs. And you stepped up in an unusual way that really was created by a vacuum of power on the Federal level.
And you're not the only one. There are other governors. And you've been very good and collaborative with Hogan down in Maryland, and Whitmer, and DeWine, and the ones up in the Northeast region. But these unusual times have demonstrated some unusual characteristics in people.
And, of course, I won't always be able to keep having you on this show. It'll never be seen as fair in people's eyes. And we both get that. And that's OK. You've got plenty of people to talk to.
But I want you to know that, you know, June is a big month for us, right? We got Mom and Pop's anniversary on the 5th. We got Pop's birthday on the 15th.
And this is what he always wanted. He was proud when you became Governor, because of what he'd know - he knew you'd do. Remember that whole talk he gave us about, ""I'm not pride - proud. I don't believe in pride. Pride is deadly sin, and blah all that.""
What he wanted to see is what you do with the opportunity. And everything, that he ever said matter to him, about public service, is what you demonstrated right here, and right now, during this period, when your State needed it most. And I hear it all the time.
Not everybody likes you. Not everybody likes me. Everybody seems to like Pop now. That's the benefit of being out for a while and maybe gone.
I just hope you recognize what even I'm able to recognize, being spawned from the same wolf pack. I hope you are able to appreciate what you did in your State, and what it means for the rest of the country now, and what it will always mean to those who love and care about you the most.
I'm wowed by what you did. And, more importantly, I'm wowed by how you did it. This was very hard. I know it's not over. But obviously, I love you as a brother. Obviously, I'll never be objective. Obviously, I think you're the best politician in the country. But I hope you feel good about what you did for your people because I know they appreciate it. Nothing's perfect. You'll have your critics.
A. CUOMO: Thank you.
C. CUOMO: But I've never seen anything like what you did.
A. CUOMO: Thank you.
C. CUOMO: And that's why I'm so happy to have had you on the show. And I hope you know that.
A. CUOMO: Yes. Look, we're not very - we're not big on sweet talk. But what Dad was all about was making a difference.
C. CUOMO: That was pretty sweet.
A. CUOMO: That was sweet.
C. CUOMO: You made a difference.
A. CUOMO: I wonder who wrote it.
What Dad was - what Dad was all about - well you just stole my line.
What Dad was all about was making a difference. And he would say, ""Who cares what they say,"" right? He lost his last election. People forget that. ""Who cares what they say? It's what you know. It's what you did is right.""
[21:30:00]
What I did here was right. And whatever, you know, was a political no- win, as you said from day one, you have people on both sides, and you couldn't make anybody happy, so you just do what's right.
I did what was right. I'm comfortable with what I did. I think the facts bear it out. I think the numbers bear it out. I think we saved tens of thousands of lives. But I did what was right.
And you do what is right. You tell the truth. You get up every night, and you tell the truth, whether they like it or not. This is the truth the way you see it. And that's all you can do.
So, I hope he'd be proud of me. He talked to me a lot through this, by the way. A 111 days, I did a briefing every day. I couldn't sleep at night. I'd close my eyes, and I would say, ""What would Pop say?"" And he spoke to me. And he helped me tremendously to get through it.
But what you do is the same thing. You're doing the right thing. And that's all we can do. Love you. Go to work.
C. CUOMO: I love you very much. I appreciate you being on. I'll see you soon.
A. CUOMO: Thank you, brother, same. C. CUOMO: Unusual times, right? He's my big brother. I love him. Of course, I'm not objective. But let's call it straight. Look at the State. Look at the numbers. Look at New Jersey. Look at Connecticut. Look how they came together.
Yes, he's my brother. That's - there's no question. I could cry about it in a second. But the results are there for all to see. Was it perfect? No. You tell me what is. But look at the state our country is in.
And if you don't think this is going to be reflected in what happens in November, then you haven't been paying attention. We got new poll numbers for you.
And this isn't about President Trump being worried or not. This is about the state of what this country is demanding, OK? There are people who are going to be worried on the Republican side. Polls are just a snapshot of a moment in time.
But let's see where we are right now, next.

C. CUOMO: You know, look, I mean, polls are a snapshot of a moment in time. They're just a suggestion. Trends are relevant, looking at specific States, relevant. But also, how they're playing within the parties will manifest in message, so that matters.
And, to that point, several high profile Republican Senators are acknowledging that they feel the same way they're seeing in the polls right now about Trump's reelection campaign. As Lindsey Graham put it, ""It's been a bad couple of weeks.""
New evidence from key Midwestern States, remember, States, not just national popularity, because it's about the Electoral College, Joe Biden, former VP, leading Trump by 8 in Wisconsin, up from 3 last month. Ohio, numbers are tight. Well within the MOE, the margin of error, Biden leading.
Important, why? Because Trump beat Clinton by 8 points there.
Florida, they're going to be in the election also. They're going to be big, right? COVID, it's not just a bad weeks. A couple - that's Senator Graham trying to play it down, because he's all about being nice to Trump. We'll see what happens if Trump loses, what song he'll sing then.
But it's not a couple of bad weeks. It's ignoring a pandemic, and having so many lives lost, where it didn't need to happen. It's about ignoring a mass movement in this country, the lives of with I haven't seen in my lifetime. I wasn't alive in the 60s. He's ignored them both.
Now, Florida is going to be in the spotlight. Their cases are popping all over the place. It's being ignored there.
Miami's Mayor is here. He knows this is serious. You know why? He's like me. He's a survivor. Let's talk about the reality, next.

(END VIDEO CLIP)
C. CUOMO: You're going to hear the Governor of Florida, who refuses to come on this show, along with all the other highly-elected officials, at the State level. They're going to mitigate what's happening in Florida. ""We have our ups. We have our downs.""
They're not telling you the truth. There's a new record-breaking single-day high in COVID cases in Florida, more than 5,500, about 1,500 more than the record they set last week.
Hospitalizations are up. ICU visits are up. Ventilations are all up in the past two weeks in the most populous county, Miami-Dade. But the Governor says he's not going to order mask wearing.
You tell me this isn't about stupid politics. You tell me this isn't about DeSantis being an acolyte of Trump. He won't come on and make the case. What does that tell you?
Miami Mayor Francis Suarez announced a City-wide mask mandate this week. He knows what the virus is like all too well.
You're looking well, though, Mayor. Welcome back to PRIME TIME.
MAYOR FRANCIS SUAREZ, (R) MIAMI, FLORIDA: Thank you so much, Chris. I really appreciate it. C. CUOMO: And I know you and I are still figuring out why we're not completely right, and that there's going to be a story to tell with this virus that you and I are trying to figure out ourselves. We'll put that into the future for some conversation someday.
Right now, the Governor says--
SUAREZ: Sure.
C. CUOMO: --""Well, you know, masks, tough to enforce, and, you know, it'd take a lot of resources, and that may not be the best use of resources."" All the experts are saying masks are the best use of resources.
Your take?
SUAREZ: We implemented a mask rule in public this week because, like you said, we saw, you know, a record number of cases the last few days in Miami-Dade County.
And, to put the numbers in context, when we ordered a stay-at-home - we put into effect a stay-at-home order, the high watermark was 533 cases, while we had two days, this week, where we had 900 cases, which is, you know, twice the high watermark in late March, when we - when we issued a stay-at-home order, which we knew was incredibly effective.
If we don't want to go backwards, the only option that we have right now is to order masks in public.
And, in fact, tomorrow, we're going to be asking the City Commission, by emergency ordinance, to implement a civil fine if you're not wearing the mask in public, which will be a fine of up to $250 for failure to follow the law.
C. CUOMO: You know, look, you're a Republican. You're doing right by your community. Period! I shouldn't even have mentioned the first part. The ""R"" is irrelevant.
But it does seem that we are seeing politics be played here by your Governor and other Republican Governors. You have not seen a Democratic Governor take the same posture that you've seen of someone like Governor DeSantis, and it has a familiar echo to the President.
Are you worried that your Governor is playing politics?
SUAREZ: Look, this is an issue where it's an apolitical issue. It's an issue that's got to be driven by the epidemiologists. We have biostatisticians. We do confer with Department of Health at least once a week, every Monday.
And after we have those conversations, after we look at the numbers, after we look at the trends, that's when we make decisions.
And it was after this week's Monday meeting with - by the way, 15 mayors joined me in, you know, in having a press conference, where many of those cities also joined the City of Miami, in implementing a mask-in-public rule.
[21:45:00]
We owe it to our residents, as your brother said, to be transparent with them. And we owe it to our residents to give them the best options that we have available, to try to stem the tide of, you know, of spread of COVID in our community.
And as you also said accurately, you know, in Miami-Dade County, hospitalizations are up. Ventilators are up. ICUs are up. Thankfully, deaths are not up. But we know that deaths are a lagging statistic that sometimes lag four weeks to five weeks after a spike in cases.
We're also hopeful that because it seems like a majority of the increase in cases is in 18-35 year-old range, we're hoping that that's not something that bleeds into the older population, which is of course more vulnerable and more likely--
C. CUOMO: Yes. That's - I'm with you on that.
(CROSSTALK)
C. CUOMO: You know, we had these girls on - ""Girls!""
We had these women on, young women, who were in Jacksonville. And they had gone out, you know. Again, the Governor and the messaging was, ""You don't really need a mask. You're going to be OK."" They go out. All 16 of them get COVID and seven of the people who were working in the bar.
The concern with the younger people is you're right that they're not getting as sick, and many can actually be asymptomatic. But they are more likely to spread it to people who don't handle it as well. And then you have a real problem.
What's your message to people tonight?
SUAREZ: My message to them is to follow the rules, to please, please do everything you can to wear masks in public in the City of Miami.
You know, it is difficult to police. There's no doubt about it. It's going to, you know, just like it was difficult to police, when we had a stay-at-home order, we weren't literally able to knock on every single door to make sure that people were at home.
But the reason why we put these recommendations in place is for our own safety and for the safety of others.
So, my recommendation and my message is to please wear a mask, when you're in public, so that we can do everything that we can to make sure that we reverse these numbers, and go from a situation where we've had record numbers, to getting things back under control, and continuing to hopefully open our economy safely.
C. CUOMO: Mr. Mayor, you are always offered a platform on this show, not just because you're a Republican, and I need voices from both sides, not just because we are ""COVID Cousins,"" because we both lived through it, but because you have been straight about what's going on in your community, and you have not dealt with the politics at all.
And I respect that. And I'm sure your community does as well. I don't usually have better-looking men on the show, which is why I like having Andrew on. But, in your case, I have to make an exception.
SUAREZ: Thanks, Chris.
C. CUOMO: Mayor Francis Suarez, God bless. The best to you and the family.
SUAREZ: Bless you.
C. CUOMO: All right, ahead, we have news in a case that we've been following very closely, the Ahmaud Arbery murder investigation in Georgia.
Of course, George Floyd matters. Of course Rayshard Brooks matters. They all matter. We forget the names, there are so many of these cases.
But in the new indictments, there is a step that's been taken by a community that is rare, and they reveal things that we must review, next.

C. CUOMO: It took a Grand Jury less than 10 minutes to indict the three men charged with killing Ahmaud Arbery.
The young man has been gone for more than four months. But remember, it took months for them to do a damn thing in that case, and it only happened because of the video that got put out. Four separate prosecutors went through this case before we got to here.
Let's take it up in Cuomo's Court with Laura Coates.
Counselor, good to have you back.
The time is going to work both ways, 10 minutes.
""Whoo! Damming facts! Strong case!""
""Nope! Bias jury! Too much media exposure! Can't be fair!""
How do you play it?
LAURA COATES, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR, SIRIUSXM HOST, ""THE LAURA COATES SHOW"", FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT: Well, first of all, the idea that it took many months for us even to get to this point.
And it wasn't simply because COVID-19 delayed the impaneling of Grand Juries. It was because of a deliberate decision, on behalf of the original prosecutors, to say ""No. We're not going to pursue these charges.""
So, the idea that being a matter of bias is almost laughable when one of the very people, who is a defendant, now charged with these crimes, is the one who provided the videotape footage that shows what happened to the 25 year-old jogging man, Ahmaud Arbery.
And so, yes, you will have this issue when it comes to trial, Chris, about whether or not you're going to find a jury that can be unbiased, that has never heard of this case, fat chance of that happening. However, it does necessarily say they cannot be objective about the evidence they're actually seeing.
And at this very early stage, as you well know, we're talking about enough to - for probable cause in an indictment. They still have to prove the case with actual evidence that can go in and come into trial.
C. CUOMO: The - right. And that's going to - the ""Beyond reasonable doubt"" is the highest standard that we have. We'll see if they have the proof to know by what they show.
Now, I don't know if you could tell how slick I was. But I was looking up the definition of malice murder in Georgia, while you were finishing your answer.
Malice murder versus felony murder, OK, as you have explained very well, before on this show, felony murder is a specific list of grave felonies that during the course of that felony, someone dies.
Now, they also charged malice murder, which I saw as being the same as just intentional murder. But there is one line that I think you'll find interesting, Counselor.
Malice is implied when no considerable provocation appears, which is a nod by the prosecutor that don't even try to argue justification, and two, where all the circumstances of the killing show an abandoned and malignant heart.
Even if it does line up statutorily as intentional murder, boy, will those words speak loud to the community! COATES: They absolutely will. And it's a - it is a signal that don't try the self-defense claim, when you are talking about why there was a struggle that ensued.
Remember, one of the things that came out the preliminary hearing was that Mr. Ahmaud Arbery ran until he couldn't run anymore, and then chose to fight.
He was pursued by cars that were used in an offensive manner, according to the indictments as well. He was trapped. He was falsely imprisoned with no legal authority to do so.
[21:55:00]
We're not talking about in a long list of cases where police officers are the subject of ire for their excessive force. We're talking about civilians here who have no, even colorable law, or colorable claim that they are acting under law. And so, you absolutely have the set- up.
But remember, the main difference between the two, a felony murder, and of course, malice is what your intent was. You don't have to have the intent for anyone to die in felony murder.
As long as you were doing something that was the wrong thing, in a felony, and just because somebody died during it, you're still accountable for their death. It's the same degree.
But the idea of intent here is what people are going to hang their hat on. They're going to say to themselves, Chris, ""Hold on. I think a bad intent, I think premeditated murder. I think about hiring a hit man. I think about a long period of time that has to take place to develop this intent,"" when in reality, it can form in almost an instant.
It need not be something that takes a very long period of time. And they may have more than enough evidence now to suggest that it happened quickly that it was an intentional act in addition to the other charges.
C. CUOMO: And they don't have to prove motive for malice murder. It sounds like hate crime or biased crime statutory language. But it isn't. They just have to prove that you had the intent in that moment.
Look, we will watch the prosecution. But the story you and I are going to tell, my friend, is going to be the story of what these men thought they knew about Arbery and why they thought they knew it. That is what is going to be part of the bigger narrative of what must change in this country.
Laura Coates, I love you. Thank you for being back.
COATES: Love you too, Chris. Thank you.
C. CUOMO: We'll be right back.

Today is Wednesday, Aug. 12, the 225th day of 2020. There are 141 days left in the year.
Today’s Highlight in History:
On August 12, 2017, a car plowed into a crowd of people peacefully protesting a white nationalist rally in the Virginia college town of Charlottesville, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and hurting more than a dozen others. (The attacker, James Alex Fields, was sentenced to life in prison on 29 federal hate crime charges, and life plus 419 years on state charges.) President Donald Trump condemned what he called an “egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.”
On this date:
In 1867, President Andrew Johnson sparked a move to impeach him as he defied Congress by suspending Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, with whom he had clashed over Reconstruction policies. (Johnson was acquitted by the Senate.)
In 1902, International Harvester Co. was formed by a merger of McCormick Harvesting Machine Co., Deering Harvester Co. and several other manufacturers.
In 1909, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, home to the Indianapolis 500, first opened.
In 1939, the MGM movie musical “The Wizard of Oz,” starring Judy Garland, had its world premiere at the Strand Theater in Oconomowoc (oh-KAH’-noh-moh-wahk), Wisconsin, three days before opening in Hollywood.
In 1944, during World War II, Joseph P. Kennedy Jr., eldest son of Joseph and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, was killed with his co-pilot when their explosives-laden Navy plane blew up over England.
In 1953, the Soviet Union conducted a secret test of its first hydrogen bomb.
In 1981, IBM introduced its first personal computer, the model 5150, at a press conference in New York.
In 1985, the world’s worst single-aircraft disaster occurred as a crippled Japan Airlines Boeing 747 on a domestic flight crashed into a mountain, killing 520 people. (Four people survived.)
In 2000, the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk and its 118-man crew were lost during naval exercises in the Barents Sea.
In 2004, New Jersey Gov. James E. McGreevey announced his resignation and acknowledged that he’d had an extramarital affair with another man.
In 2009, guitar virtuoso Les Paul died in White Plains, New York, at 94.
In 2013, James “Whitey” Bulger, the feared Boston mob boss who became one of the nation’s most-wanted fugitives, was convicted in a string of 11 killings and dozens of other gangland crimes, many of them committed while he was said to be an FBI informant. (Bulger was sentenced to life; he was fatally beaten at a West Virginia prison in 2018, hours after being transferred from a facility in Florida.)
Ten years ago: General Motors Co. chief Ed Whitacre announced he was stepping down as CEO on September 1, 2010, saying his mission was accomplished as the company reported its second straight quarterly profit. (Whitacre was succeeded as CEO by GM board member Daniel Akerson.)
Five years ago: Islamic State sympathizers circulated an image that appeared to show the body of a Croatian hostage abducted in Egypt, the first such killing of a foreign captive since the extremist group established a branch in the Arab country. Deadly warehouse blasts in the Chinese port city of Tianjin claimed 165 lives. Former President Jimmy Carter announced he had been diagnosed with cancer following recent liver surgery.
One year ago: A whistleblower complaint bearing this date stated: “In the course of my official duties, I have received information from multiple U.S. Government officials that the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.” (The complaint was addressed to Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence; it did not reach them until Sept. 25.)

OSLO — A 22-year-old Norwegian man who said he was inspired by far-right attacks was sentenced on Thursday to 21 years in prison after being convicted of killing his stepsister and opening fire in a mosque near Oslo last August.
The lawyer for the gunman, Philip Manshaus, had sought to use an insanity defense to argue that her client was not criminally liable, but the court made clear on Thursday that it considered him sane in handing down the sentence, which can be extended if he were to be considered a continued threat to society.
Still, the strategy employed by Mr. Manshaus’s legal team prompted a debate in Norway about the limitations of the insanity defense and whether protections intended to preserve free speech have allowed right-wing extremists to spread hateful ideology on social media platforms.
Mr. Manshaus, 22, admitted killing his stepsister, Johanne Zhangjia Ihle-Hansen, and attacking the al-Noor Islamic Center in Baerum, an Oslo suburb, while wearing a helmet, camera and body armor. He opened fire in the mosque, but was overpowered by two men inside before anyone was shot.
Mr. Manshaus admitted to carrying out the attack, but he maintained that he was not guilty of any crime during courtroom tirades in which he expressed anti-Semitic views, made homophobic slurs and flashed a hand signal linked to the white power movement.
Speaking during the trial, Mr. Manshaus said his only regret was that he failed to cause more harm. He pleaded not guilty to murder and terrorism charges, claiming his acts were in “self-defense” on behalf of “the European people.”
He must serve at least 14 years, but the sentence could be extended indefinitely under conditions known as special detention.
Johan Overberg, the public prosecutor, said he was content that the court shared the prosecution’s view, both on Mr. Manshaus’s guilt and the length of the sentence.
“He has said he would do a similar act again, if given the opportunity,” Mr. Overberg said. “That means there is a danger of repetition, and in order to protect society from him, special detention is necessary.”
The murder of Ms. Ihle-Hansen, 17, who was adopted from China as a child, was considered a hate crime, as prosecutors argued that there was a racial element to Mr. Manshaus’s decision to kill her.
Mr. Manshaus shot her four times at their family home, then drove to a local mosque, armed with two rifles and one shotgun, and burst through the back door. Before he could shoot anyone, he was tackled and pinned to the ground by two men while a third man called the police.
Irfan Mushtaq, a board member at the mosque, told reporters that the community had been preparing to celebrate Eid al-Adha, a major Muslim holiday, and that an armed attack only one day later could have resulted in many deaths as the mosque would have been crowded with worshipers.
The violence had striking similarities to an attack just months earlier on two mosques in New Zealand by a self-avowed white supremacist, Brenton Tarrant, who live streamed an assault in which he killed 51 people. Mr. Tarrant posted a manifesto online shortly before the attack, outlining his white supremacist views.
During his trial, Mr. Manshaus said he was inspired by Mr. Tarrant’s hate-filled screed. Minutes before storming the mosque, Mr. Manshaus posted his own message in an online forum praising Mr. Tarrant, writing, “It’s been fun” and “Valhalla awaits,” a rallying cry of white supremacists.
The attack echoed another terrorist attack in Norway, in 2011, when Anders Breivik set off a bomb in Oslo and went on a shooting rampage at a political summer camp for young people that left 77 people dead.
Mr. Breivik was also sentenced to 21 years in prison under special detention.
Anne Bitsch, a researcher of militant nationalism, noted the similarities between Mr. Manshaus and Mr. Breivik, and the way they tried to manipulate the justice system.
Both men grew up in affluent areas of Oslo, had troubled childhoods and a distant parent, she said, adding that although they came from different generations, both men espoused violent and racist views.
“Both envision a sort of race war, and both are trying to use the court to convey a message to their like-minded,” Ms. Bitsch said in an interview.
But she said that despite their clear calls for racially driven violence, “whether or not their motives are psychological or political or both will continue to be a matter of debate.”
Mr. Manshaus’s lawyer, Unni Fries, pleaded insanity on her client’s behalf, even though he maintained throughout the trial that he was sane at the time of the attack. She referred to a “paranoid worldview” and “disillusions” and hinted at a history of mental illness in the family.
However, a report by court psychiatrists concluded that Mr. Manshaus was sane and fit to be imprisoned for his crimes.

 During a White House press conference on Monday, Trump urged Americans to stop politicizing the virus, but moments later blamed China for the deteriorating pandemic situation in the US, adding, “The virus came from China, it’s China’s fault.”
 ""We must stop politicizing the virus and instead be united in our condemnation of how this virus came to America, how this virus came to the world,"" Trump said.
 This is not the first time that Trump has used such a radically charged term to deflect from his own failures in responding to the pandemic by blaming China. On August 8, Trump put up a post on his Twitter account, in which he called COVID-19 the “China Virus.” The comment quickly drew a public backlash, with netizens around the globe creating the hashtag “TrumpsCovidCoverup” and launching an online campaign calling for the president to stop using such racist and groundless terms.
 “Trump calls it the China virus, I call it the Trump virus. China had nothing to do with what Trump did to American people,” said Maggie Schafer, a Twitter user.
 The Trump administration’s smearing of China has not changed the fact that the US has the worst COVID-19 outbreak in the world, with the highest numbers of confirmed fatalities and reported cases. According to Johns Hopkins University, there were over 5 million reported COVID-19 cases and more than 163,000 confirmed deaths from the virus in the US as of Monday, making the president’s groundless accusation even more feeble and absurd.
 As a public figure, Trump’s irresponsible remarks have exacerbated the already rising xenophobic behavior in the US. According to Chinese advocacy groups, between March and June, 2,100 hate crimes against Asian Americans related to COVID-19 were committed, 10 percent of which were physical.
 According to a China Daily report, an 89-year-old Chinese American woman in Brooklyn, New York, was slapped in the face and then set on fire by two men. Even Asian American celebrities, including actress Min-Na Wen and model Kelly Hu have told the public about hate crimes targeting their family members and friends.
 “What is the China Virus, is COVID too difficult for Trump? And to be fair, why don’t we rename it for Trump who wants to spread it everywhere in America?"" said Pam Szitas, a Twitter user."

Ted Lieu (D-CA) News Release",FALSE,"WASHINGTON - Today, Congressman Ted W. Lieu (D-Los Angeles County), along with Reps. Rob Woodall, Judy Chu and Pete Olson, led a bipartisan letter of 150 Members of Congress calling on Attorney General William Barr to publicly condemn acts of anti-Asian bias stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Members also urged AG Barr to provide regular status updates regarding the steps the Department of Justice is taking and will take going forward to combat this behavior.
In the letter, the Members wrote:
Dear Attorney General Barr:
Thank you for featuring the quote ""Coronavirus is no excuse for hate"" on the Department of Justice's hate crimes website. The COVID-19 pandemic affects all Americans and has wrought enormous pain in the United States. Some Americans are facing increased discrimination as a result of the pandemic. We write to draw particular attention to an increase in verbal and physical attacks as well as discrimination towards Asian Americans who have been wrongly blamed for the virus' spread. We respectfully request that you publicly condemn acts of anti-Asian bias, and provide us with regular status updates regarding the steps the Department of Justice is taking and will take going forward to combat this behavior.
Asian Americans are not responsible for the spread of coronavirus in the United States; yet, since the start of the pandemic they have experienced continued harassment, violence, and discrimination. As of June 3, the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council reported 2,066 incidents of coronavirus-related discrimination. These and numerous news reports have documented cases ranging from the denial of services at stores to verbal harassment on the subway to physical assaults.
In one particularly egregious instance, an individual in Texas stabbed three Asian Americans, two of whom were children, because he thought they were infecting others with COVID-19. In March, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Houston field office acknowledged the likelihood of a surge in hate crime incidents against Asian Americans.And most recently, a new Ipsos survey conducted for the Center for Public Integrity found that more than 30 percent of Americans have witnessed someone blaming Asian people for the coronavirus pandemic.
We appreciate the op-ed the Department placed in the Washington Examiner generally stating that hate crimes will be investigated and prosecuted. However, the dangers faced by the Asian American community today are very real and deserve a strong and specific response by our government. In fact, on May 8, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights acknowledged its concerns ""over the increase in xenophobic animosity toward Asian Americans (and perceived Asian Americans) as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic"" and unanimously issued recommendations urging federal agencies reduce this sentiment.
We note that in the early 2000s during the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak, the Bush Administration immediately took steps to prevent discrimination against Asian Americans by creating a community outreach team to monitor and document acts of anti-Asian bias and engage with the community.
Two years earlier following the September 11 terrorist attacks, the Administration had similarly sought to prevent attacks against Arab, Muslim, Sikh, and South Asian American communities by engaging with community leaders, conducting coordinated civil rights enforcement, and speaking out forcefully. While these prior responses were not perfect, they represented an important effort to acknowledge and address the specific discrimination.
Despite the fear present within the community, each and every day Asian Americans help to combat COVID-19. While Asian Americans comprise 7 percent of the U.S. population, 17.1 percent of active medical physicians are Asian American. Similarly, Asian Americans are serving our country by working as nurses, health aides, and in many other essential occupations. Asian Americans are just as American as any other group of people in our country.
We respectfully request that you, as head of the Department of Justice, forcefully condemn anti-Asian bias to send an unambiguous message to all Americans that discrimination against this community is un-American and will not be tolerated. Further, we would ask that you update us regularly as to what steps the Department has taken to address our concerns. Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

Austin Tong was an average college kid working on his degree from Fordham University in New York City when, last week, he posted a couple pictures on Instagram that made him the target of an irrational Internet mob and a scurrilous university investigation. The pictures he posted which nearly got him kicked out of school were of a retired police captain who was recently killed by looters, and one of him holding an AR-15.
His posts prompted a hateful reaction from intolerant ""keyboard warriors"" who despise the police and the Second Amendment. Fordham University officials then opened an investigation and charged him with intimidation, making threats, disorderly conduct, and a hate crime all for posting a picture of himself with a lawfully purchased and owned firearm and one of a slain police officer. Now he has been banned from campus, asked to write a letter of apology, and told he must complete implicit bias and multicultural sensitivity training in order to graduate with his degree.
Today is the deadline for Austin to make his decision. He plans on saying no. And, if the university wants to kick him out, he says they're going to have a legal fight on their hands.
Stories similar to Mr. Tong's are happening all over America. The NRA will stand and fight for every citizen's rights. Please consider joining or donating today to support Mr. Tong, and the NRA cause.
Here are five quick questions and answers from new NRA member Austin Tong.
You were born in China and immigrated to the United States. How did that happen?
America is the land of opportunity and I think everyone around the world knows that. My parents, who came first, wanted to make a better life for themselves and their family. They knew America was a free country and people come here because of everything the country has to offer. That's why we moved to New York.
Have you always been interested in firearms?
I've always had an interest, mostly thanks to video games, but I never really thought about buying one before. But after recent events I thought it would be a good way to keep me and my family safe.
I'll admit I wasn't always a believer, but as time went on, I began to appreciate the rights we have as Americans more and more. And that's how I got into trouble because I expressed that appreciation.
What was it like to receive a midnight visit from the Fordham Safety Officers?
Well, I posted the pictures, received the backlash, and a few hours later received a call from the officers saying they were a few minutes away and wanted to talk. I looked out my door and saw them standing outside my home. One came in and one stayed with the car. It was basically about 20 minutes of questions about the firearm, why I posted the pictures, and what I was trying to say.
I'm a good guy, a good person, so while I was a little shook by the visit I knew I'd done nothing wrong. I knew people would probably criticize the post, but I wasn't expecting the level of backlash, the death threats, the calls for expulsion, or that the entire school would get involved. I was shocked, appalled, and disappointed. But I didn't do anything wrong and that's why, if they carry through with their threats, we're going to sue.
We've read about the horrible comments you received, including the death threats, but have all the reactions been negative?
No, not at all. There were a ton of nasty comments after the initial post but once the word really got out, where the NRA really helped a lot, I started hearing from the media, other Instagramers, and people from the firearm community.
That's why I'm doing this. At first this was my case by now I think of it as the country's. I don't know what's going to happen when I don't comply with Fordham's demands. I don't' know what's going to happen to my future but after receiving all those messages from people around the country and around the world people from all backgrounds and political parties I knew I had to do more. They were telling me their stories, similar stories, how they were silenced or too scared to share their stories. That should never happen not here in America.
That's why I'm doing this. That's why I'm standing up. When there's no free speech then America isn't America anymore. That's what drives me. It's empowering what the NRA did, what people across the country have done, and I think we'll have a great case for protecting free speech.
Did the reaction from Fordham officials surprise you?
It did because the guy who charged me, the dean of students, he knows me. And the safety officers said I wasn't a threat or being intimidating. They said there's nothing wrong with me yet they're still trying to kick me out of school.
I'm shocked and surprised because they know me. They know who I am. And I expected more from this esteemed university."

In a letter addressed to the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, the signatories write to ""voice our grave concern about the future of democracy in Poland, a country with an admirable history of resistance to totalitarianism and struggle for freedom"" and express their outrage at ""repressions directed against the LGBT+ community in Poland"".
Other signatories include film directors Pedro Almodóvar, Yorgos Lanthimos, Mike Leigh, Luca Guadagnino and Pawel Pawlikowski, who is Polish; actors Ed Harris, Isabelle Huppert and Stellan Skarsgaard; and writers John Banville and Sebastian Barry, Deborah Levy, Édouard Louis and Valeria Luiselli.
The letter, started by Tokarczuk, film director Agnieszka Holland and sociologist Agnieszka Graff, comes amid intensifying anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric by government officials and state media, and a crackdown on LGBTQ+ equality protests after the recent re-election of Duda, leading the populist Law and Justice (PiS) party, for a second five-year term.
Since taking power in 2015, Duda has railed against LGBTQ+ rights as an ""ideology"" and foreign import that threatens Poland's Christian values. With more than 86% of the population identifying as Roman Catholic, Duda has proposed the establishment of a ""Family Charter"", which would ban ""the propogation of LGBTQ+ ideology in schools and public institutions"" and stop LGBTQ+ people getting married or having children. Anti-LGBTQ+ attacks are currently not considered a hate crime under Polish law.
Authorities in one-third of municipalities across Poland have declared themselves ""LGBT-free zones"" since 2019, a non-binding, but menacing resolution calling for the end of tolerance of LGBTQ+ individuals. Last month, the European Union announced that it would cut funding to six Polish towns that made this declaration, while one Dutch town, Nieuwegein, voted to sever longstanding ties with its twin town, Pulawy in eastern Poland, over the issue.
The letter calls attention to the case of Margot, a non-binary activist who was placed in pre-trial detention for two months on 7 August. In June, she was accused of assaulting a van driver who was broadcasting homophobic slurs from a loudspeaker. In July, along with three others, she was arrested again for ""insulting religious feelings and insulting Warsaw monuments"" by putting rainbow flags on statues throughout the city.
On 7 August, after her detention, hundreds of protesters took to the streets of Warsaw with signs reading ""Give us back Margot"" and ""We are behind Margot"". Some 48 people were arrested on charges of taking part in an illegal gathering. In a nod to the 1969 Stonewall Uprising in New York, a landmark protest in LGBTQ+ rights, Polish Twitter users documented the protests using #PolishStonewall.
The letter calls Margot's actions ""neither 'hooliganism' nor 'provocations', as Poland's government-run media insist, but rather desperate acts of resistance against degrading homophobic hate speech.""
The letter goes on: ""The van is one of many similar vehicles parading outrageous claims around the cities of Poland: equating homosexuality with paedophilia, and asserting that gays are the source of diseases and a threat to children. Efforts to stop this well-funded hate campaign by legal means had led to nothing.
""Homophobic aggression in Poland is growing because it is condoned by the ruling party, which has chosen sexual minorities as a scapegoat with no regard for the safety and well-being of citizens. Margot is, in fact, a political prisoner, held captive for her refusal to accept indignity.""
The signatories call upon the Polish government to ""stop targeting sexual minorities"" and on the European Commission to ""take immediate steps to defend core European values - equality, non-discrimination, respect for minorities - which are being blatantly violated in Poland. LGBT+ rights are human rights and must be defended as such."""

Virus-related laws include those offering help to essential workers, boosting unemployment benefits and requiring time off for sick employees. A resolution in Alabama formally encouraged fist-bumping over handshakes.
Legislatures also addressed police use of force against Black people and others of color after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis led to widespread protests against police brutality. Among other things, new laws will mandate oversight and reporting, create civilian review panels and require more disclosures about problem officers.
States including California, Delaware, Iowa, New York, Oregon and Utah passed bans on police chokeholds. Floyd, who was Black, died after a white officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes while being recorded on video, even as Floyd pleaded for air.
New York state Assemblyman Walter T. Mosley noted the hundreds of Black men and women killed at the hands of police between the cries of “I can't breathe” by Eric Garner, who died after being put in a chokehold by New York City police in 2014, and those of Floyd in May.
Mosley, a Brooklyn Democrat who is Black, said the Eric Garner Anti-Chokehold Act was ""an important step forward, but it will not be the last.”
Despite reforms in some states, the response to Floyd's death was not uniform. Similar use-of-force or disciplinary proposals in several other states failed, and some even moved in the opposite direction.
Georgia created a new crime beginning Jan. 1 defined as bias-motivated intimidation, which would apply to the death or serious bodily injury of police, firefighters and emergency personnel. It also extends to cases involving more than $500 worth of damage to their property because of “actual or perceived employment as a first responder.” Violations are punishable by one to five years in prison and a fine of as much as $5,000.
The law was passed by Republicans over the objections of Democrats and civil liberties groups, who said police already have enough protections. Republicans insisted on the law as part of a deal to pass a new hate crimes law in Georgia that drew bipartisan support.
While legislatures tackled some elements of the coronavirus outbreak this year, most sessions had ended before the current wave of cases, deaths and renewed stay-at-home orders. Lawmakers of both major parties have vowed to make the pandemic response a centerpiece of their 2021 sessions, addressing issues ranging from school reopenings to governors' emergency powers.
The virus also refocused attention on the nation's uneven and expensive heath care system. Tackling issues of coverage and costs were common themes in 2020.
A Washington measure caps the monthly out-of-pocket cost of insulin at $100 until Jan. 1, 2023, and requires the state Health Care Authority to monitor the price of insulin. A new Connecticut law requires pharmacists to dispense a 30-day emergency supply of diabetes-related drugs and devices, with a price cap, for diabetics who have less than a week's supply. Both laws take effect Jan. 1.
“It’s unconscionable that anyone should have to limit or go without a common and widely-available life-saving drug on an emergency basis in America in 2021,” Connecticut state Sen. Derek Slap, a West Hartford Democrat, said in a statement.
A much-anticipated Medicaid expansion is coming to Oklahoma in the new year after years of resistance from Republicans in the Legislature and governor's office. Voters narrowly approved a constitutional amendment expanding the federal-state insurance program to an additional estimated 215,000 low-income residents. It takes effect in July.
Lawmakers must determine how to cover the projected $164 million state share during their 2021 session. The cost could be considerably higher, given the number of Oklahomans who have lost their jobs and work-related health insurance because of the pandemic.
Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt had urged voters to reject the plan. He said the state would have to “either raise taxes or cut services somewhere else like education, first responders, or roads and bridges” to pay for the expansion.
A new law in Georgia aims to limit consumers from getting stuck with surprise medical bills by requiring insurers in many cases to pay for care by a doctor or at a hospital not within their network of providers. The law protects patients from financial responsibility beyond what they would normally have to pay. Instead, insurers and providers can take disputes to the state insurance commissioner. Minnesota also has what's being called a continuity of care law, going into effect Jan. 1.
Other notable laws taking effect in the new year:
— Voters in Arizona, Montana, New Jersey and South Dakota approved measures legalizing recreational marijuana. New Jersey’s Democratic-led Legislature and Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy are working to set up a legal marketplace and to update laws already on the books to decriminalize marijuana possession.
— Colorado will prohibit landlords from refusing to show, rent or lease housing based on a person’s source of income or involvement in the type of contract required to receive public housing assistance. Landlords can still do credit checks, but the act makes it an unfair housing practice unless they’re conducted checks for every prospective tenant.
— New Hampshire will make multiple changes to state laws regarding sexual assault. Starting Jan. 1, the definition of sexual assault will be expanded to include any sexual contact between school employees and students between the ages of 13 and 18. Previously, such contact could be considered consensual and not a crime if the student was 16 or 17. Other legislation taking effect in mid-January increases protections for sexual assault victims and requires colleges and universities to adopt sexual misconduct policies. The bill requires colleges to provide free access to medical and legal support services, anti-retaliation protections, confidential advising services, data on sexual violence, and prevention and response training.
— Georgia will require an audit starting in 2021 before movies and television productions are awarded the state’s generous tax credit, which has allowed the highest subsidies of any state. The credit, which rebates up to 30% of a production’s value, cost nearly $900 million in foregone tax revenue in 2019 as movie and TV production boomed in Georgia. Examinations were highly critical of the tax credit, finding some companies that received tax credits didn’t earn them.
— California will require companies based there to have at least one board director by the end of 2021 who is a racial or sexual minority, with larger numbers required by 2022. Companies with 100 or more employees also must start sending information on employees’ race, ethnicity and gender to the state.
— Connecticut employers must begin taking deductions from their employees’ paychecks for a new paid family and medical leave program, under a state law passed in 2019. The state’s estimated 100,000 businesses will be responsible for withholding half a percent from worker wages. Qualified employees can begin receiving benefits on Jan. 1, 2022. Massachusetts also begins a new paid family medical leave program in the new year. It offers a 12-week benefit in most cases, extending to 26 weeks for those caring for a military member undergoing treatment.
— Oklahoma will extend a property tax exemption for religious institutions to include property owned by a church if it conducts instruction of children from pre-K through grade 12.

Christian Cooper, the Black bird watcher whose cell phone video of Amy Cooper calling the police on him in Central Park unleashed the wrath of the Internet on her, explained in aWashington Postop-edTuesday why he isn t cooperating with prosecutors in the criminal case against her, saying that he doesn t want to see Amy Cooper in jail for an offense where he suffered no harm. 
KEY FACTS
Christian Cooper said he believes Amy Cooper s actions reveal long-standing, deep-seated racial bias in the U.S., but added she should not be charged with a crime because she has already lost her job and reputation, and it s hard to see what is to be gained by a criminal charge, aside from the upholding of principle, he said.
 If her current setbacks aren t deterrent enough to others seeking to weaponize race, it s unlikely the threat of legal action would change that, he wrote.
Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vancechargedher last week with falsely reporting an incident in the third degree, which is punishable with up to a year in jail.
Christian Cooper emphasized that he didn t suffer any mental or physical harm from the incident, adding that if the fear is that the police would have done me harm as a result of Cooper s call, then the solution is to fix policing. 
Cooper s argument is also shared by a subset of criminal justice reform advocates, including Josie Duffy Rice, the president of nonprofit website The Appeal, who tweeted that charging Amy Cooper reinforces the idea that justice can only be found in the disastrous carceral system we ve created. 
Crucial quote
 So while acknowledging the principle at stake, I must err on the side of compassion and choose not to be involved in this prosecution. Let the DA do his job. He has already decided to pursue charges; if he feels my involvement is essential to the case, he can subpoena me. If subpoenaed, I will testify, truthfully and accurately. Otherwise, the case is the DA s, not mine, Christian Cooper wrote.
Chief critic
Christian Cooper s sister, Melody, said in a statement on Twitter she disagrees with her brother s decision. What is true for my brother who rarely has run-ins with the police, certainly not violent ones, is not true for most men in the black community. He can afford to be compassionate, but that is NOT the case for most Black men in this country. Not by a long shot, she said.

""It's an attempt to intimidate these demonstrators and to silence them.""Some cases are viewed as trumped up and should not be in federal court, lawyers say, like a teen accused of civil disorder for claiming online ""we are not each other's enemy, only enemy is 12,"" a reference to law enforcement.The Trump administration has seized on the demonstrations and an aggressive federal response to showcase what the president says is his law-and-order prowess, claiming he's countering rising crime in cities run by Democrats. 
Trump has derided protesters and played up the violence around protests, though the majority are peaceful.Pockets of violence have indeed popped up in cities across the U.S., including Portland, Oregon, where protests devolved into clashes with law enforcement for weeks on end. Nights of looting and other unrest have occurred in other cities, including Rochester, New York; Minneapolis, Louisville, Washington and Chicago.Federal officials were also called into to Kenosha, Wisconsin, after large protests and unrest following the shooting of Jacob Blake and the gunning down of two protesters and later arrest of a 17-year-old in their deaths. Notably, that teen has not been charged with any federal crimes. Neither was a man accused of shooting and killing a demonstrator in Louisville following the death of Breonna Taylor.While Barr has gone after protest-related violence targeted at law enforcement, he has argued there's seldom reason to open sweeping investigations into the practices of police departments. The Justice Department, however, has opened a number of civil rights investigations into individual cases. Barr has said he does not believe there is systemic racism in police departments, even though Black people are disproportionately more likely to be killed by police, and public attitudes over police reforms have shifted.Federal involvement in local cases is nothing new. Officials across the country have turned to the Justice Department for decades, particularly for violent crime and gang cases where offenders could face much stiffer federal penalties and there is no parole.Police chiefs in several cities have pointed to the importance of their relationships with federal prosecutors to bring charges that can result in long prison sentences to drive down violent crime.Even before the unrest earlier this year, the Justice Department was stepping in to bring charges in states where the government believes justice isn't being fully pursued by local prosecutors. In January, for example, the department brought federal hate crime charges against a woman accused of slapping three Orthodox Jewish women in one of several apparently anti-Semitic attacks reported throughout New York during Hanukkah.It's not clear whether protest-related arrests will continue apace. Demonstrations have slowed, though not necessarily because of the federal charges. Wildfires in the West and hurricanes in the South have dampened some of the conflict.While many local prosecutors have dismissed dozens of low-level protest arrests, some are still coming down hard. A Pennsylvania judge set bail at $1 million for about a dozen people in a protest that followed the death of a knife-wielding man by police.Even some Democrats, including District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser, have called for the Justice Department to pursue federal charges against violent demonstrators, going as far as accusing the Trump administration of declining to prosecute rioters. Washington's Metropolitan Police Department had arrested 42 people one August weekend after a protest left a trail of vandalism. But prosecutors said the arrest paperwork didn't identify specific crimes tied to each suspect.The federal confrontation with Bowser seemed counterintuitive, though Trump has a history of squaring off against the Democratic mayor.About a third of the federal protest-related cases are in Portland, for crimes such as assaulting a deputy U.S. marshal with a baseball bat, setting fires and setting off explosives at the federal courthouse and throwing rocks at officers.Three purported ""Boogaloo"" members, who use the loose movement's name as a slang term for a second civil war or collapse of civilization, were charged with possessing a homemade bomb and inciting a riot in Las Vegas.An El Paso, Texas, man was accused of promoting hate speech, posting a video online with a racist epithet and making threatening comments to Black Lives Matter protesters while holding a military-style rifle at his feet. A Minnesota man was accused of helping burn down a police precinct headquarters there after Floyd's death.But other cases simply don't belong in federal court, lawyers say.In Seattle, 35-year-old Isaiah Willoughby, who's accused of setting fire to the outside of a police precinct, faces a mandatory minimum of five years in prison if convicted of arson in federal court. He could be looking at around a year behind bars in state court, where his lawyer said the case belongs.""This is city property that has been destroyed and you have a local prosecutors office that is ready and willing and able to charge these cases in state court, but the federal government is attempting to emphasize these protest-related crimes for whatever agenda they are seeking to pursue,"" said assistant federal public defender Dennis Carroll.Carroll accused federal authorities of using the cases to try to make the protests seem more violent and disruptive than they really were.Federal prosecutors earlier this month agreed to dismiss the charge against a man who authorities said was found with a Molotov cocktail in his backpack after he and other protesters were arrested in May for blocking traffic in Jacksonville, Florida. Video showed that 27-year-old Ivan Zecher was wrongfully arrested because he was actually on the sidewalk - not in the street - meaning prosecutors couldn't pursue their case, Zecher's attorney, Marcus Barnett said.""There is absolutely an agenda here to blow these out of proportion, make these look more serious or more sinister than it is,"" Barnett said of the pursuit of federal charges. ""This is the Justice Department, from the top, furthering an agenda that has nothing to do with justice,"" he said.- Michael Balsamo, Allana Durkin Richer and Colleen Long

Virus-related laws include those offering help to essential workers, boosting unemployment benefits and requiring time off for sick employees. A resolution in Alabama formally encouraged fist-bumping over handshakes.
 Legislatures also addressed police use of force against Black people and others of color after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis led to widespread protests against police brutality. Among other things, new laws will mandate oversight and reporting, create civilian review panels and require more disclosures about problem officers.
 States including California, Delaware, Iowa, New York, Oregon and Utah passed bans on police chokeholds. Floyd, who was Black, died after a white officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes while being recorded on video, even as Floyd pleaded for air.
 New York state Assemblyman Walter T. Mosley noted the hundreds of Black men and women killed at the hands of police between the cries of ""I can't breathe"" by Eric Garner, who died after being put in a chokehold by New York City police in 2014, and those of Floyd in May.
 Mosley, a Brooklyn Democrat who is Black, said the Eric Garner Anti-Chokehold Act was ""an important step forward, but it will not be the last.""
 Despite reforms in some states, the response to Floyd's death was not uniform. Similar use-of-force or disciplinary proposals in several other states failed, and some even moved in the opposite direction.
 Georgia created a new crime beginning Jan. 1 defined as bias-motivated intimidation, which would apply to the death or serious bodily injury of police, firefighters and emergency personnel. It also extends to cases involving more than $500 worth of damage to their property because of ""actual or perceived employment as a first responder."" Violations are punishable by one to five years in prison and a fine of as much as $5,000.
 The law was passed by Republicans over the objections of Democrats and civil liberties groups, who said police already have enough protections. Republicans insisted on the law as part of a deal to pass a new hate crimes law in Georgia that drew bipartisan support.
 While legislatures tackled some elements of the coronavirus outbreak this year, most sessions had ended before the current wave of cases, deaths and renewed stay-at-home orders. Lawmakers of both major parties have vowed to make the pandemic response a centerpiece of their 2021 sessions, addressing issues ranging from school reopenings to governors' emergency powers.
 The virus also refocused attention on the nation's uneven and expensive heath care system. Tackling issues of coverage and costs were common themes in 2020.
 A Washington measure caps the monthly out-of-pocket cost of insulin at $100 until Jan. 1, 2023, and requires the state Health Care Authority to monitor the price of insulin. A new Connecticut law requires pharmacists to dispense a 30-day emergency supply of diabetes-related drugs and devices, with a price cap, for diabetics who have less than a week's supply. Both laws take effect Jan. 1.
 ""It's unconscionable that anyone should have to limit or go without a common and widely-available life-saving drug on an emergency basis in America in 2021,"" Connecticut state Sen. Derek Slap, a West Hartford Democrat, said in a statement.
 A much-anticipated Medicaid expansion is coming to Oklahoma in the new year after years of resistance from Republicans in the Legislature and governor's office. Voters narrowly approved a constitutional amendment expanding the federal-state insurance program to an additional estimated 215,000 low-income residents. It takes effect in July.
 Lawmakers must determine how to cover the projected $164 million state share during their 2021 session. The cost could be considerably higher, given the number of Oklahomans who have lost their jobs and work-related health insurance because of the pandemic.
 Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt had urged voters to reject the plan. He said the state would have to ""either raise taxes or cut services somewhere else like education, first responders, or roads and bridges"" to pay for the expansion.
 A new law in Georgia aims to limit consumers from getting stuck with surprise medical bills by requiring insurers in many cases to pay for care by a doctor or at a hospital not within their network of providers. The law protects patients from financial responsibility beyond what they would normally have to pay. Instead, insurers and providers can take disputes to the state insurance commissioner. Minnesota also has what's being called a continuity of care law, going into effect Jan. 1.
 Other notable laws taking effect in the new year:
 — Voters in Arizona, Montana, New Jersey and South Dakota approved measures legalizing recreational marijuana. New Jersey's Democratic-led Legislature and Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy are working to set up a legal marketplace and to update laws already on the books to decriminalize marijuana possession.
 — Colorado will prohibit landlords from refusing to show, rent or lease housing based on a person's source of income or involvement in the type of contract required to receive public housing assistance. Landlords can still do credit checks, but the act makes it an unfair housing practice unless they're conducted checks for every prospective tenant.
 — New Hampshire will make multiple changes to state laws regarding sexual assault. Starting Jan. 1, the definition of sexual assault will be expanded to include any sexual contact between school employees and students between the ages of 13 and 18. Previously, such contact could be considered consensual and not a crime if the student was 16 or 17. Other legislation taking effect in mid-January increases protections for sexual assault victims and requires colleges and universities to adopt sexual misconduct policies. The bill requires colleges to provide free access to medical and legal support services, anti-retaliation protections, confidential advising services, data on sexual violence, and prevention and response training.
 — Georgia will require an audit starting in 2021 before movies and television productions are awarded the state's generous tax credit, which has allowed the highest subsidies of any state. The credit, which rebates up to 30% of a production's value, cost nearly $900 million in foregone tax revenue in 2019 as movie and TV production boomed in Georgia. Examinations were highly critical of the tax credit, finding some companies that received tax credits didn't earn them.
 — California will require companies based there to have at least one board director by the end of 2021 who is a racial or sexual minority, with larger numbers required by 2022. Companies with 100 or more employees also must start sending information on employees' race, ethnicity and gender to the state.
 — Connecticut employers must begin taking deductions from their employees' paychecks for a new paid family and medical leave program, under a state law passed in 2019. The state's estimated 100,000 businesses will be responsible for withholding half a percent from worker wages. Qualified employees can begin receiving benefits on Jan. 1, 2022. Massachusetts also begins a new paid family medical leave program in the new year. It offers a 12-week benefit in most cases, extending to 26 weeks for those caring for a military member undergoing treatment.
 — Oklahoma will extend a property tax exemption for religious institutions to include property owned by a church if it conducts instruction of children from pre-K through grade 12.

The sedition statute doesn't require proof of a plot to overthrow the government, the memo read. It instead could be used when a defendant tries to oppose the government’s authority by force.
Attorney General William Barr has been pushing his U.S. attorneys to bring federal charges in protest-related violence whenever they can, keeping a grip on cases even if a defendant could be tried instead in state court.

The federal confrontation with Bowser seemed counterintuitive, though Trump has a history of squaring off against the mayor.
About one-third of the federal protest-related cases are in Portland, for crimes such as assaulting a deputy U.S. marshal with a baseball bat, setting fires and setting off explosives at the federal courthouse and throwing rocks at officers.
Three purported ""Boogaloo"" members, who use the loose movement's name as a slang term for a second civil war or collapse of civilization, were charged with possessing a homemade bomb and inciting a riot in Las Vegas.
An El Paso, Texas, man was accused of promoting hate speech, posting a video online with a racist epithet and making threatening comments to Black Lives Matter protesters while holding a military-style rifle at his feet. A Minnesota man was accused of helping burn down a police precinct headquarters there after Floyd's death.
But other cases simply do not belong in federal court, lawyers say.
In Seattle, 35-year-old Isaiah Willoughby, who's accused of setting fire to the outside of a police precinct, faces a mandatory minimum of five years in prison if convicted of arson in federal court. He could be looking at about a year behind bars in state court, where his lawyer said the case belongs.
""This is city property that has been destroyed and you have a local prosecutors office that is ready and willing and able to charge these cases in state court, but the federal government is attempting to emphasize these protest-related crimes for whatever agenda they are seeking to pursue,"" said assistant federal public defender Dennis Carroll.
Carroll accused federal authorities of using the cases to try to make the protests seem more violent and disruptive than they really were.
Federal prosecutors this month agreed to dismiss the charge against a man who authorities said was found with a Molotov cocktail in his backpack after he and other protesters were arrested in May for blocking traffic in Jacksonville, Florida. Video showed that 27-year-old Ivan Zecher was wrongfully arrested because he was actually on the sidewalk - not in the street - meaning prosecutors could not pursue their case, Zecher's attorney, Marcus Barnett said.
""There is absolutely an agenda here to blow these out of proportion, make these look more serious or more sinister than it is,"" Barnett said of the pursuit of federal charges. ""This is the Justice Department, from the top, furthering an agenda that has nothing to do with justice,"" he said.

During a four-hour service broadcast live on every major U.S. television network from a church in Floyd's boyhood home of Houston, family members, clergy and politicians exhorted Americans to turn grief and outrage at his death into a moment of reckoning for the nation.
The funeral followed two weeks of protests ignited by graphic video footage of Floyd, 46, handcuffed and lying face down on a Minneapolis street while an officer kneels into the back of his neck for nearly nine minutes. The video shows Floyd gasping for air as he cries out, ""Mama,"" and groans, ""Please, I can't breathe,"" before falling silent and still.
The officer, Derek Chauvin, 44, has since been charged with second-degree murder and three other officers with aiding and abetting Floyd's May 25 death. All were dismissed from the department a day after the incident.
Floyd's dying words have become a rallying cry for hundreds of thousands of protesters around the globe who have since taken to the streets, undaunted by the coronavirus pandemic, demanding justice for Floyd and an end to mistreatment of minorities by U.S. law enforcement.
""I can breathe. And as long as I'm breathing, justice will be served,"" Floyd's niece Brooklyn Williams declared in a eulogy that drew applause from mourners inside the Fountain of Praise Church. ""This is not just a murder but a hate crime.""
'BIG FLOYD'
Williams was one of several relatives and friends who addressed the service, remembering Floyd as a loving, larger-than-life personality. The memorial was punctuated by gospel music and a video montage of shared memories of the man affectionately known as ""Big Floyd.""
His younger brother, Terrence Floyd, spoke about awakening in the middle of the night in recent days traumatized by the memory of seeing his older sibling calling out for their mother as he lay dying.
His older brother, Philonise, sobbing in grief, told mourners, ""George was my personal superman.""
Civil rights activist the Rev. Al Sharpton called Floyd ""an ordinary brother"" who grew up in a housing project but left behind a legacy of greatness despite rejections in jobs and sports that prevented him from achieving all that he once aspired to become.
""God took the rejected stone and made him the cornerstone of a movement that is going to change the whole wide world,"" Sharpton said, invoking a biblical parable from the New Testament.
Sharpton said the Floyd family would lead a march on Washington being organized for Aug. 28 to mark the 57th anniversary of the 1963 ""I Have a Dream"" speech given from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial by civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., who was assassinated in 1968.
'HOME-GOING CELEBRATION'
Some 2,500 people attended the funeral, after more than 6,000 people filed past Floyd's open casket on Monday.
Two columns of uniformed Houston police officers saluted the golden casket as it was wheeled from the hearse into the church before the service. A horse-drawn carriage later bore the coffin on its last mile to the cemetery in Pearland, Texas, where Floyd was buried in a private ceremony.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate in the Nov. 3 election, addressed the funeral service via a video recording, lamenting that ""too many black Americans wake up knowing that they could lose their life in the course of just living their life.""
""We must not turn away. We cannot leave this moment thinking we can once again turn away from racism,"" he said.
Two voter registration tables were set up outside the church.
MOURNING FAMILIES
Among those in attendance were loved ones of several other black men killed by white police or white civilians.
The mother of Eric Garner, the New York man who died in a police chokehold in 2014, was present, as was the family of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Georgia man who was shot and killed in February while jogging. Three white men were charged in his death.
Fallout from Floyd's death, and reaction to a spate of arson and looting that accompanied some of the otherwise mostly peaceful protests, also plunged President Donald Trump into one of the biggest crises of his tenure.
Hundreds of protesters packed Seattle's city hall late Tuesday night, chanting demands for the resignation of the mayor and the defunding the police force.
Days after Seattle's mayor and police chief promised a month-long moratorium on tear gas, the department used it again on protesters overnight Sunday, bringing severe criticism.
A Republican, Trump repeatedly threatened to order the military onto the streets to quell protests, focusing on restoring order while saying little about the U.S. racial wounds at the root of the upheavals.

As Congress prepares to wade into a contentious debate over legislation to address police brutality and systemic racial bias, a long-simmering dispute in the Senate over a far less controversial bill that would for the first time explicitly make lynching a federal crime has burst into public view. 
 The bill, called the Emmett Till Antilynching Act after the 14-year-old black boy who was tortured and killed in 1955 in Mississippi, predates the recent high-profile deaths of three black men and women at the hands of white police and civilians that have inspired protests across the country. It passed the House this year by a vote of 410 to 4, and has the backing of 99 senators, who have urged support for belated federal recognition of a crime that once terrorized black Americans.
 But the private objections of one Republican, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, have succeeded for months in preventing it from becoming law. At a time when lawmakers are looking at an array of other, potentially more divisive proposals to respond to a spate of recent killings of black Americans, the impasse illustrates the volatile mix of raw emotion and political division that has often frustrated attempts by Congress to enact meaningful changes in the law when it comes to matters of racial violence.
 The issue erupted on the Senate floor on Thursday afternoon, when Mr. Paul sought to narrow the bill's definition of lynching and push the revised measure through without a formal vote, drawing angry rebukes from two of the bill's authors, Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California, both African-American Democrats.
 Mr. Paul argued that the lynching bill was sloppily written and could lead to yet another injustice -- excessive sentencing for minor infractions -- unless it was revised.
 ''This bill would cheapen the meaning of lynching by defining it so broadly as to include a minor bruise of abrasion,'' he said. ''Our national history of racial terrorism demands more seriousness of us than that.''
 Mr. Paul said that he took lynching seriously, but ''this legislation does not.''
 Ms. Harris rose to object, delivering a seething broadside against Mr. Paul as she noted that even as they debated, mourners were gathering to honor George Floyd, the African-American man who died last week after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.
 ''The idea that we would not be taking the issue of lynching seriously is an insult -- an insult to Senator Booker and Senator Tim Scott and myself,'' she said from across the chamber floor, referring to the South Carolina Republican who helped write the bill and is the party's lone black senator.
 ''To suggest that lynching would only be a lynching if someone's heart was pulled out and displayed to someone else is ridiculous,'' she added. ''It should not require a maiming or torture for us to recognize a lynching when we see it and recognize it by federal law and call it what it is, which is that it is a crime that should be punishable with accountability and consequence.''
 At issue is what, exactly, counts as lynching under federal law. The bill would add a new section called ''lynching'' to the civil rights statute to deal with group violence meant to intimidate people of color or other protected groups. The offense would be classified as a conspiracy by two or more people to cause bodily harm in connection with a hate crime, with penalties up to life in prison if convicted. Mr. Paul proposed to raise the bar beyond the standard in federal hate crimes statutes, to ''serious bodily injury,'' so that only crimes involving conspiracy to cause ''substantial risk of death and extreme physical pain'' could be charged as lynching, according to aides.
 Such crimes can already be considered hate crimes under state and federal law. But the term lynching has deep historical significance, and the fact that it has never been formally outlawed has been an enduring symbol of Congress's inability to fully reckon with the nation's history of racial violence. The issue has taken on even greater significance in recent days.
 Ms. Harris called the recent killing of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old black man jogging in Georgia who was chased down and shot by white men, ''a modern lynching.'' In court on Thursday, one of the men charged with murder in the case said he heard another use a racial slur as Mr. Arbery lay dying.
 Members of Congress have been fighting in one way or another to pass federal anti-lynching laws for more than a century, introducing nearly 200 such bills in the first half of the 20th century. When such a law would have had the most explicit effect, during the Jim Crow era when thousands of black people where lynched across the country, Southern senators succeeded repeatedly in blocking its passage.
 The Senate formally apologized in 2005 for failing to outlaw the practice, and long ago adopted other measures to make racially motivated killings federal crimes.
 Speaking after Ms. Harris on Thursday, Mr. Booker, describing himself as ''raw'' over the state of the country, pleaded with Mr. Paul to drop his objections, if only to offer a glimmer of hope to a nation in pain.
 ''Does America need a win today on racial justice? Does the anguished cries of people in the streets?'' he asked. ''It may not cure the ills so many are protesting about, but God, it could be a sign of hope.''
 Mr. Paul has such influence because senators are trying to pass the bill by unanimous consent, rather than through a traditional recorded vote, meaning any one senator can grind consideration to a halt. The bill would easily have passed were it put up for a regular vote, but Republican leaders have so far been unwilling to go that route because it would eat up several days of the full Senate's time and they believe Mr. Paul may yet be persuaded to drop his objections.
 Mr. Booker and Mr. Paul have worked together on criminal justice legislation in the past, and are recognized as two of the Senate's leading advocates for reducing prison sentences and lowering incarceration rates. But Mr. Booker chastised Mr. Paul for being the lone obstacle in Congress to the anti-lynching bill.
 ''Tell me another time when 500-plus Congress people -- Democrats, Republicans, House members and senators -- come together in a chorus of conviction and say, 'Now is the time in America that we condemn the dark history of our past and actually pass anti-lynching legislation,''' Mr. Booker said.
 Mr. Paul conceded that his position was unpopular, but insisted that changes were necessary so that the measure would be worthy of its name.
 ''You think I take joy in being here?'' he said. ''I will be excoriated by simple minded people on the internet who think somehow I don't like Emmet Till or appreciate the history or memory of Emmett Till.''
 Mr. Paul said he was concerned that the bill would allow excessive penalties against people who commit more minor, racially motivated acts of violence, like slapping or pushing. He did not account for why his position had changed from last year, when he supported the bill as written.
 ''Words have meaning,'' he said. ''It would be a disgrace for the Congress of the United States to declare that a bruise is lynching, that an abrasion is lynching, that any injury to the body, no matter how temporary, is on par with the atrocities done to people like Emmett Till.''
 Mr. Booker said the notion that anyone would be charged with lynching for slapping someone was ''absurd.''
 Mr. Paul did not back down, and senators left Washington for the week without reaching a resolution, leaving Democrats calling the episode a missed opportunity.
 ''The frustrating thing for me is that at a time this country hungers for common-sense racial reconciliation, an acknowledgment of our past and a looking forward to a better future, this will be one of the sad days where that possibility was halted,'' Mr. Booker said.

Barr pushed his U.S. attorneys to bring federal charges whenever they could, keeping a grip on cases even if a defendant could be tried instead in state court, according to officials with knowledge of last week's call who were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity. Federal convictions often result in longer prison sentences.
The Trump administration's crackdown has already led to more than 300 arrests for federal crimes allegedly committed in protests since the death of George Floyd. An AP analysis of the data shows that while many people are accused of violent crimes such as arson for hurling Molotov cocktails and burning police cars and assault for injuring law enforcement, others are not. That's led to criticism that at least some arrests are a politically motivated effort to stymie demonstrations.
""The speed at which this whole thing was moved from state court to federal court is stunning and unbelievable,"" said Charles Sunwabe, who represents an Erie, Pennsylvania, man accused of lighting a fire at a coffee shop after a May 30 protest. ""It's an attempt to intimidate these demonstrators and to silence them,"" he said.
Some cases are viewed as concocted and should not be in federal court, lawyers say, including a teenager accused of civil disorder for claiming online ""we are not each other's enemy, only enemy is 12,"" a reference to law enforcement.
The administration has seized on the demonstrations and an aggressive federal response to showcase what President Donald Trump says is his law-and-order prowess, claiming he is countering rising crime in cities run by Democrats. Trump has derided protesters and played up the violence around protests, though the majority of them are peaceful.
The Justice Department had also explored whether it could pursue either criminal or civil rights charges against city officials in Portland, Oregon, after clashes erupted there night after night between law enforcement and demonstrators, a department spokesperson told The Associated Press. The department had done research on whether it could pursue either criminal charges or action through civil litigation, spokesperson Kerri Kupec said. She declined to comment on the status or whether charges would be brought.
Violent protests
Pockets of violence have indeed popped up in cities, including Portland, Oregon, where protests devolved into clashes with law enforcement for several weeks. Nights of looting and other unrest have occurred elsewhere: Rochester, New York; Minneapolis; Louisville, Kentucky; Washington and Chicago.
Federal officials were called into Kenosha, Wisconsin, after large protests and unrest following the shooting of Jacob Blake and the gunning down of two protesters and the subsequent arrest of a 17-year-old in their deaths. Notably, that teenager has not been charged with any federal crimes. Neither was a man accused of shooting and killing a demonstrator in Louisville following the death of Breonna Taylor.
While Barr has gone after protest-related violence targeted at law enforcement, he has argued there is seldom a reason to open sweeping investigations into the practices of police departments. The Justice Department, however, has initiated a number of civil rights investigations into individual cases. Barr has said he does not believe there is systemic racism in police departments, even though Black people are disproportionately more likely to be killed by police, and public attitudes about police reforms have shifted.
During the call with U.S. attorneys, Barr raised the prospect that prosecutors could bring a number of other charges in unrest cases, including the rarely used sedition statute, according to the officials familiar with the call. Legal experts cautioned the use of that statute is unlikely, as sedition can be difficult to prove in court.
Federal role
Federal involvement in local cases is nothing new. Officials across the country have turned to the Justice Department for decades, particularly for violent crime and gang cases where offenders could face much stiffer federal penalties and there is no parole.
Police chiefs in several cities have pointed to the importance of their relationships with federal prosecutors to bring charges that can result in long prison sentences to drive down violent crime.
Even before the unrest earlier this year, the Justice Department was stepping in to bring charges in states where the government believes justice is not being fully pursued by local prosecutors. In January, for example, the department brought federal hate crime charges against a woman accused of slapping three Orthodox Jewish women in one of several apparently anti-Semitic attacks reported throughout New York during Hanukkah.
It is not clear whether protest-related arrests will continue apace. Demonstrations have slowed, though not necessarily because of the federal charges. Wildfires in the West and hurricanes in the South have lessened some of the conflict.
While many local prosecutors have dismissed dozens of low-level protest arrests, some are still coming down hard. A Pennsylvania judge set bail at $1 million for about a dozen people in a protest that followed the death of a knife-wielding man by police.
Even some Democrats, including District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser, have called for the Justice Department to pursue federal charges against violent demonstrators, going as far as accusing the administration of declining to prosecute rioters. Washington's Metropolitan Police Department had arrested 42 people one August weekend after a protest left a trail of vandalism. But prosecutors said the arrest paperwork did not identify specific crimes tied to each suspect.
The federal confrontation with Bowser seemed counterintuitive, though Trump has a history of squaring off against the mayor.
Protest-related cases
About one-third of the federal protest-related cases are in Portland, for crimes such as assaulting a deputy U.S. marshal with a baseball bat, setting fires and setting off explosives at the federal courthouse, and throwing rocks at officers.
Three purported Boogaloo members, who use the loose movement's name as a slang term for a second civil war or collapse of civilization, were charged with possessing a homemade bomb and inciting a riot in Las Vegas.
An El Paso, Texas, man was accused of promoting hate speech, posting a video online with a racist epithet and making threatening comments to Black Lives Matter protesters while holding a military-style rifle at his feet.

While many local prosecutors have dismissed dozens of low-level protest arrests, some are still coming down hard. A Pennsylvania judge set bail at $1 million for about a dozen people in a protest that followed the death of a knife-wielding man by police. Even some Democrats, including District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser, have called for the Justice Department to pursue federal charges against violent demonstrators, going as far as accusing the Trump administration of declining to prosecute rioters.

111,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_751/Files (250).DOCX","The Independent (United Kingdom)",2020-09-17,"1398 words","WIRES,US; Version:1","Via AP news wire",NA,"300 and counting: Push by feds to arrest in US protests",FALSE," In a private call with federal prosecutors across the country, Attorney General William Barr's message was clear: aggressively go after demonstrators who cause violence. 
Barr pushed his U.S. attorneys to bring federal charges whenever they could, keeping a grip on cases even if a defendant could be tried instead in state court, according to officials with knowledge of last week's call who were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity. Federal convictions often result in longer prison sentences.
The Trump administration's crackdown has already led to more than 300 arrests on federal crimes in the protests since the death of George Floyd. An AP analysis of the data shows that while many people are accused of violent crimes such as arson for hurling Molotov cocktails and burning police cars and assault for injuring law enforcement, others are not. That's led to criticism that at least some arrests are a politically motivated effort to stymie demonstrations. 
""The speed at which this whole thing was moved from state court to federal court is stunning and unbelievable,"" said Charles Sunwabe, who represents an Erie, Pennsylvania, man accused of lighting a fire at a coffee shop after a May 30 protest. ""It's an attempt to intimidate these demonstrators and to silence them,"" he said. 
Some cases are viewed as trumped up and should not be in federal court, lawyers say, including a teenager accused of civil disorder for claiming online ""we are not each other's enemy, only enemy is 12,"" a reference to law enforcement. 
 The administration has seized on the demonstrations and an aggressive federal response to showcase what President Donald Trump says is his law-and-order prowess, claiming he is countering rising crime in cities run by Democrats. Trump has derided protesters and played up the violence around protests, though the majority of them are peaceful. 
The Justice Department had also explored whether it could pursue either criminal or civil rights charges against city officials in Portland, Oregon after clashes erupted there night after night between law enforcement and demonstrators, a department spokesperson told The Associated Press. The department had done research on whether it could pursue either criminal charges or action through civil litigation, spokesperson Kerri Kupec said. She declined to comment on the status or whether charges would be brought.
Pockets of violence have indeed popped up in cities, including Portland, Oregon, where protests devolved into clashes with law enforcement for weeks on end. Nights of looting and other unrest have occurred elsewhere: Rochester, New York; Minneapolis, Louisville, Washington, D.C., and Chicago. 
Federal officials were called into to Kenosha, Wisconsin, after large protests and unrest following the shooting of Jacob Blake and the gunning down of two protesters and later arrest of a 17-year-old in their deaths. Notably, that teenager has not been charged with any federal crimes. Neither was a man accused of shooting and killing a demonstrator in Louisville following the death of Breonna Taylor. 
While Barr has gone after protest-related violence targeted at law enforcement, he has argued there is seldom a reason to open sweeping investigations into the practices of police departments. The Justice Department, however, has initiated a number of civil rights investigations into individual cases. Barr has said he does not believe there is systemic racism in police departments, even though Black people are disproportionately more likely to be killed by police, and public attitudes over police reforms have shifted.
During the call with U.S. attorneys, Barr raised the prospect that prosecutors could bring a number of other potential charges in unrest cases, including the rarely used sedition statute, according to the officials familiar with the call. Legal experts cautioned the use of that statute is unlikely, given its difficulty to prove in court. 
Federal involvement in local cases is nothing new. Officials across the country have turned to the Justice Department for decades, particularly for violent crime and gang cases where offenders could face much stiffer federal penalties and there is no parole.
Police chiefs in several cities have pointed to the importance of their relationships with federal prosecutors to bring charges that can result in long prison sentences to drive down violent crime. 
Even before the unrest earlier this year, the Justice Department was stepping in to bring charges in states where the government believes justice is not being fully pursued by local prosecutors. In January, for example, the department brought federal hate crime charges against a woman accused of slapping three Orthodox Jewish women in one of several apparently anti-Semitic attacks reported throughout New York during Hanukkah.

In what appears to be a hate crime, Congresswoman Anel Bueno's body was discovered in a shallow grave precisely a month after her abduction by a group of armed men in the drug cartel capital.'Your departure hurts me deeply --I'm saddened not just by the fact but by the cruelty,' tweeted Indira Vizcano, a local politician from the same party, stressing upon the need for justice and deeper investigation into such crimes that the region is notoriously known for. 
The Colima state prosecutor's office released a statement on Wednesday that specified how the legislator's body was found in a grave alongside the bodies of three men. While the bodies were discovered on Monday, the remains of the lawmaker weren't identified by authorities until Tuesday.The 38-year-old Mexican lawmaker visited the area to inform residents about the dangers of the novel coronavirus and how to protect themselves during the pandemic.While the exact cause behind Bueno's murder is yet to be known, Mexico's PresidentAndrs Manuel López Obradorinformed the detention of a prime suspect during a press meet in Campeche on Wednesday. 'We still don't know the causes, just that there is someone in custody and there is already a statement about who was responsible,' López Obrador said.A volley of Obrador's allies expressed their condolences over the death of their party member. Colima has earned an infamous reputation of being one of the riskiest places amongone of five Mexican states after its murder rates skyrocketed in the past years. Incidentally, miscreants have targeted politicians in the past. In 2017 Ixtlahuacn's mayor, Crispn Gutirrez, was killed. Last July, the mayor of the port of Manzanillo was attacked with gunfire but escaped unharmed, as reported by a media outlet.[1]As stated ina recent report[2], In 2017 Tecomn's murder rate touched 172.5deaths per 100,000 inhabitants --mirroring a ghastly state of affairs in the region. Things only seemed to get worse, as over 100 clandestine cemeterieswere found in 2019 --comprising of corpses of those who had 'dared cross the cartels.'

Virus-related laws include those offering help to essential workers, boosting unemployment benefits and requiring time off for sick employees. A resolution in Alabama formally encouraged fist-bumping over handshakes.
Legislatures also addressed police use of force against Black people and others of color after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis led to widespread protests against police brutality. Among other things, new laws will mandate oversight and reporting, create civilian review panels and require more disclosures about problem officers.
States including California, Delaware, Iowa, New York, Oregon and Utah passed bans on police chokeholds. Floyd, who was Black, died after a white officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes while being recorded on video, even as Floyd pleaded for air.
New York state Assemblyman Walter T. Mosley noted the hundreds of Black men and women killed at the hands of police between the cries of “I can't breathe” by Eric Garner, who died after being put in a chokehold by New York City police in 2014, and those of Floyd in May.
Mosley, a Brooklyn Democrat who is Black, said the Eric Garner Anti-Chokehold Act was ""an important step forward, but it will not be the last.”
Despite reforms in some states, the response to Floyd's death was not uniform. Similar use-of-force or disciplinary proposals in several other states failed, and some even moved in the opposite direction.
Georgia created a new crime beginning Jan. 1 defined as bias-motivated intimidation, which would apply to the death or serious bodily injury of police, firefighters and emergency personnel. It also extends to cases involving more than $500 worth of damage to their property because of “actual or perceived employment as a first responder.” Violations are punishable by one to five years in prison and a fine of as much as $5,000.
The law was passed by Republicans over the objections of Democrats and civil liberties groups, who said police already have enough protections. Republicans insisted on the law as part of a deal to pass a new hate crimes law in Georgia that drew bipartisan support.
While legislatures tackled some elements of the coronavirus outbreak this year, most sessions had ended before the current wave of cases, deaths and renewed stay-at-home orders. Lawmakers of both major parties have vowed to make the pandemic response a centerpiece of their 2021 sessions, addressing issues ranging from school reopenings to governors' emergency powers.
The virus also refocused attention on the nation's uneven and expensive heath care system. Tackling issues of coverage and costs were common themes in 2020.
A Washington measure caps the monthly out-of-pocket cost of insulin at $100 until Jan. 1, 2023, and requires the state Health Care Authority to monitor the price of insulin. A new Connecticut law requires pharmacists to dispense a 30-day emergency supply of diabetes-related drugs and devices, with a price cap, for diabetics who have less than a week's supply. Both laws take effect Jan. 1.
“It’s unconscionable that anyone should have to limit or go without a common and widely-available life-saving drug on an emergency basis in America in 2021,” Connecticut state Sen. Derek Slap, a West Hartford Democrat, said in a statement.
A much-anticipated Medicaid expansion is coming to Oklahoma in the new year after years of resistance from Republicans in the Legislature and governor's office. Voters narrowly approved a constitutional amendment expanding the federal-state insurance program to an additional estimated 215,000 low-income residents. It takes effect in July.
Lawmakers must determine how to cover the projected $164 million state share during their 2021 session. The cost could be considerably higher, given the number of Oklahomans who have lost their jobs and work-related health insurance because of the pandemic.
Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt had urged voters to reject the plan. He said the state would have to “either raise taxes or cut services somewhere else like education, first responders, or roads and bridges” to pay for the expansion.
A new law in Georgia aims to limit consumers from getting stuck with surprise medical bills by requiring insurers in many cases to pay for care by a doctor or at a hospital not within their network of providers. The law protects patients from financial responsibility beyond what they would normally have to pay. Instead, insurers and providers can take disputes to the state insurance commissioner. Minnesota also has what's being called a continuity of care law, going into effect Jan. 1.
Other notable laws taking effect in the new year:
— Voters in Arizona, Montana, New Jersey and South Dakota approved measures legalizing recreational marijuana. New Jersey’s Democratic-led Legislature and Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy are working to set up a legal marketplace and to update laws already on the books to decriminalize marijuana possession.
— Colorado will prohibit landlords from refusing to show, rent or lease housing based on a person’s source of income or involvement in the type of contract required to receive public housing assistance. Landlords can still do credit checks, but the act makes it an unfair housing practice unless they’re conducted checks for every prospective tenant.
— New Hampshire will make multiple changes to state laws regarding sexual assault. Starting Jan. 1, the definition of sexual assault will be expanded to include any sexual contact between school employees and students between the ages of 13 and 18. Previously, such contact could be considered consensual and not a crime if the student was 16 or 17. Other legislation taking effect in mid-January increases protections for sexual assault victims and requires colleges and universities to adopt sexual misconduct policies. The bill requires colleges to provide free access to medical and legal support services, anti-retaliation protections, confidential advising services, data on sexual violence, and prevention and response training.
— Georgia will require an audit starting in 2021 before movies and television productions are awarded the state’s generous tax credit, which has allowed the highest subsidies of any state. The credit, which rebates up to 30% of a production’s value, cost nearly $900 million in foregone tax revenue in 2019 as movie and TV production boomed in Georgia. Examinations were highly critical of the tax credit, finding some companies that received tax credits didn’t earn them.
— California will require companies based there to have at least one board director by the end of 2021 who is a racial or sexual minority, with larger numbers required by 2022. Companies with 100 or more employees also must start sending information on employees’ race, ethnicity and gender to the state.
— Connecticut employers must begin taking deductions from their employees’ paychecks for a new paid family and medical leave program, under a state law passed in 2019. The state’s estimated 100,000 businesses will be responsible for withholding half a percent from worker wages. Qualified employees can begin receiving benefits on Jan. 1, 2022. Massachusetts also begins a new paid family medical leave program in the new year. It offers a 12-week benefit in most cases, extending to 26 weeks for those caring for a military member undergoing treatment.
— Oklahoma will extend a property tax exemption for religious institutions to include property owned by a church if it conducts instruction of children from pre-K through grade 12.

During a four-hour service broadcast live on every major U.S. television network from a church in Floyd's boyhood home of Houston, family members, clergy and politicians exhorted Americans to turn grief and outrage at his death into a moment of reckoning for the nation.
The funeral followed two weeks of protests ignited by graphic video footage of Floyd, 46, handcuffed and lying face down on a Minneapolis street while an officer kneels into the back of his neck for nearly nine minutes. The video shows Floyd gasping for air as he cries out, ""Mama,"" and groans, ""please, I can't breathe,"" before falling silent and still.
The officer, Derek Chauvin, 44, has since been charged with second-degree murder and three other officers with aiding and abetting Floyd's May 25 death.
His dying words have become a rallying cry for tens of thousands of protesters around the globe who have since taken to the streets, undaunted by the coronavirus pandemic, demanding justice for Floyd and an end to mistreatment of minorities by U.S. law enforcement.
""I can breathe. And as long as I'm breathing, justice will be served,"" Floyd's niece Brooke Williams declared in a eulogy that drew applause from mourners inside the Fountain of Praise Church in Houston. ""This is not just a murder but a hate crime.""
'BIG FLOYD'
Williams was one of several relatives and friends, most dressed all in white, who addressed the service, remembering Floyd as a loving, larger-than-life personality. The memorial was punctuated by gospel music and a video montage of shared memories of the man affectionately known as ""Big Floyd.""
His younger brother, Terrence Floyd, spoke about awakening in the middle of the night in recent days traumatized by the memory of seeing his older sibling calling out for their mother as he lay dying.
Another brother, Philonise, sobbing in grief, told mourners, ""George was my personal superman.""
Taking the stage to deliver the main eulogy, the Reverend Al Sharpton, a prominent civil rights activist and television commentator, called Floyd ""an ordinary brother"" who left behind a legacy of greatness despite shortcomings that prevented him from achieving all that he once aspired to become.
""God took the rejected stone and made him the cornerstone of a movement that is going to change the whole wide world,"" Sharpton said.
He added that the Floyd family would lead a march on Washington being organized for Aug. 28 to mark the 57th anniversary of the 1963 ""I Have a Dream"" speech given from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial by slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., assassinated in 1968.
'HOME-GOING CELEBRATION'
Some 2,500 people attended the funeral, which followed memorial services last week in Minneapolis, where Floyd made his home after leaving Houston, and Raeford, the North Carolina town where he was born. More than 6,000 people filed past Floyd's open casket on Tuesday as he lay in repose inside the church.
""This is a home-going celebration,"" the Rev. Mia Wright, co-pastor at the church, told mourners. Banners featured pop art illustrations of Floyd wearing a baseball cap with a halo above it.
American flags lined the streets outside the church. Flowers and bouquets were placed around a photograph of Floyd.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate in the Nov. 3 election, addressed the service via a video recording, lamenting that ""too many black Americans wake up knowing that they could lose their life in the course of just living their life.""
""We must not turn away. We cannot leave this moment thinking we can once again turn away from racism,"" he said.
Two voter registration tables were set up outside the church.
MOURNING FAMILIES
Among those in attendance were loved ones of several other black men killed by white police or white civilians.
The mother of Eric Garner, the New York man who died in a police chokehold in 2014, was present, as was the family of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Georgia man who was shot and killed in February while jogging. Three white men were charged in his death.
But it was the chillingly graphic video rendering of Floyd's death that triggered an outpouring of rage like no other such killing in recent memory, reinvigorating the Black Lives Matter movement and thrusting demands for racial justice to the top of the political agenda in the United States and around the world.
Fallout from Floyd's death, and reaction to a spate of arson and looting that accompanied some of the otherwise mostly peaceful protests, also plunged President Donald Trump into one of the biggest crises of his tenure.
A Republican, Trump repeatedly threatened to order the military onto the streets to quell protests, focusing on restoring order while saying little about the U.S. racial wounds at the root of the upheavals.

Michael Brown was fatally shot by a Ferguson, Missouri, police officer in August 2014, triggering local riots and a national narrative about lethally racist police. Officers backed off proactive policing in minority neighborhoods, having been told that such discretionary enforcement was racially oppressive. By early 2015, the resulting spike in shootings and homicides had become patent and would lead to an additional 2,000 black homicide victims in 2015 and 2016, compared with 2014 numbers.Today's violent-crime increase—call it Ferguson Effect 2.0 or the Minneapolis Effect—has come on with a speed and magnitude that make Ferguson 1.0 seem tranquil. 
George Floyd's death at the hands of Minneapolis police in late May was justly condemned—but the event has now spurred an outpouring of contempt against the pillars of law and order that has no precedent in American history. Every day, another mainstream institution—from McDonald's to Harvard—denounces the police, claiming without evidence that law enforcement is a threat to black lives.To be sure, the first manifestation of the Black Lives Matter movement had a mouthpiece in the Oval Office, lacking now. It doesn't matter. Presidential imprimatur or no, the reborn Black Lives Matter has gained billions of dollars in corporate support, more billions in free round-the-clock media promotion, and a ruthless power to crush dissent from the now-universal narrative about murderous police bigots. During the two weeks of national anarchy that followed the death of George Floyd, cops were shot, slashed, and assaulted; their vehicles and station houses were firebombed and destroyed. American elites stayed silent. Since then, police have continued to be shot at and attacked; the elites remain silent. Monuments to America's greatest leaders are being defaced with impunity; anarchists took over a significant swathe of a major American city, including a police precinct, without resistance from the authorities. And a push to defund the police gains traction by the day.The rising carnage in the inner city is the consequence of this official repudiation of the criminal-justice system. The current tolerance and justification for vandalism and violence; the silencing of police supporters; and police unwillingness to intervene, even when their own precincts are assaulted—all send a clear message to criminals that society has lost the will to prevent lawlessness. In Minneapolis, shootings have more than doubled this year compared to last. Nearly half of all those shootings have occurred since George Floyd's death, according to a Minneapolis Star Tribune analysis. On Father's Day, a mass shooting on a crowded street uptown struck 11 people. The next day saw a chain of retaliatory shootings—the first next to a park filled with children, the next, 90 minutes later, on a notorious gang-dominated street intersection. In nearby St. Paul, reported firearms discharges have more than doubled. The same gangbangers are getting shot repeatedly. One 17-year-old boy has been shot in four different events over the last month and a half.In Chicago, 18 people were killed and 47 wounded in drive- and walk-by shootings last weekend. The fatalities included a one-year-old boy riding in a car with his mother (the gunman drove up alongside and emptied his gun into the vehicle) and a 10-year-old girl struck in the head inside her home; a group of youth on the street outside her house had started shooting at another group of youth nearby. The previous weekend in Chicago, 104 people were shot, 15 fatally. The deceased included a three-year-old boy riding in a car with his father on Father's Day—his gangbanger father was the intended victim—and a 13-year-old girl shot in her head in her home.New York City's homicide rate is at a five-year high; the number of shooting victims was up over 42 percent through June 21 compared with the same period in 2019. The number of shootings in the first three weeks of June was over twice that of the same period in 2019, making this June the city's bloodiest in nearly a quarter century, according to the New York Times. At 4 A.M. last Sunday, a 30-year-old woman was shot in the head in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, at a house party. On Saturday afternoon, a man and a woman were shot to death outside a Brooklyn home. Early Friday morning, a 19-year-old girl was shot to death in the heart of Manhattan, near Madison Square Park, on East 26th Street.Milwaukee's homicides have increased 132 percent. 'In 25 years, I've never seen it like this,' a Milwaukee police inspector told the Police Executive Research Forum, referring to the violence and the low officer morale. Shootings are spiking in Indianapolis. Other cities will show similar increases once their crime data are published.By now, these drearily mindless gang shootings echo one another. Another three-year-old boy was shot in Chicago with his gangbanger father on another Father's Day, this one in 2016; the boy is paralyzed for life. The young children recently shot inside their homes also recall Ferguson 1.0 incidents. In August 2016, a nine-year-old girl was shot to death in Ferguson on her mother's bed while doing homework. The gunman was a 21-year-old felon on probation from a robbery conviction who deliberately shot at least six bullets into the home, located near a memorial for Michael Brown. But the pedigree of these domestic drive-bys is longer and more ominous. In New York, children used to sleep in bathtubs before Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Police Commissioner William Bratton began restoring lawfulness to the city in 1994; we are fast returning to that pre-Giuliani era.So far this year, more people have been killed in Baltimore than at this point in 2019, which ended with the highest homicide rate on record for that city. June's killings, which eclipse those of June 2019, include a 23-year-old woman who was eight months pregnant and her three-year-old daughter. They were gunned down in their car by the father of the woman's unborn child, according to the police.The victims in these shootings are overwhelmingly black. So far this year, 78 percent of all homicide victims in Chicago are black, though blacks are less than a third of the population. But the defund-the-police advocates and the Democratic establishment have said nothing about the growing loss of black lives.Instead, the Black Lives Matter movement is tweeting about police defunding, last weekend's gay pride marches, and NASCAR's Bubba Wallace, the subject of yet another hate-crime hoax. DeRay Mckesson, an early BLM organizer in Ferguson, is retweeting about whether homophobes are secretly gay. Activist Shaun King, who recently called for vandals to destroy stained-glass windows portraying the Baby Jesus and Mary, is retweeting that Mount Rushmore is an act of vandalism. Ja'Mal Green, a Black Lives Matter organizer in Chicago who was arrested in 2016 for assaulting and attempting to disarm an officer, offered a $5,000 reward on Saturday for information on the killing of the one-year-old boy in Chicago, but coupled that offer with another call to defund the police. Since then, Green has been tweeting about abortion rights and the extradition of President Trump to Iran. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is tweeting about abortion rights, gay pride, and Trump's culpability for the coronavirus epidemic. The Vera Institute for Justice, a liberal criminal-justice think tank, announced on Monday that 'now is the time to spend less on policing' in order to 'create safer communities for Black people.' ...What we have learned is that Black Lives Matter is a fraud. The death of a black person at the hands of the police is all that matters regardless of the reason for the death. Other black lives do not matter at all to this commie organization. Mob violence and looting have resulted in several deaths of black law enforcement officers and Black Lives Matter could care less. Police defunding and stepping back from enforcement has also led to more crimes against blacks and more homicides. They do not matter to Black Lives Matter. It looks like the goal of Black Lives Matter is to facilitate crime.What we are also seeing is a war against civilization being waged by criminal elements.

Standing on the corner of Bayard and Mulberry streets in New York's Chinatown on March 8, Nancy Yao Maasbach, president of the Museum of Chinese in America, and Yue Ma, Moca's director of collections and research, are dressed head to toe in white Tyvek hazmat suits, with N95 masks covering their faces. 
Ma and Yao Maasbach are protecting themselves from mould, asbestos and other toxins that could have been released by the massive fire that consumed the 19th century former public school housing the museum's archives at 70 Mulberry Street on the night of January 23, two days before Lunar New Year. 
The museum itself was left unscathed, four blocks away, on Centre Street, in a modern space designed by Chinese-American architect Maya Lin. But shock ripped through the neighbourhood and social media as initial reports suggested that Moca's archives - more than 85,000 historic artefacts and documents stored at 70 Mulberry Street, the museum's previous home - had been destroyed. 
The collection included thousands of photographs, out-of-print Chinese-American newspapers and signage from old stores. There were artefacts from laundries, sweatshops and restaurants, as well as ""paper son"" documents of Chinese men who had evaded the United States' Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 by posing as relatives of American citizens. 
""This isn't only about Asian art,"" says Yao Maasbach. ""We are part of the American narrative."" 
Charlie Lai and Jack Tchen were young men in the 1970s, members of a new generation of Chinese-Americans fluent in English and educated at prestigious universities, often on scholarships. Lai was born in Hong Kong and immigrated with his family to New York in the late 60s, when he was nine years old. Tchen was American-born Chinese by way of Madison, Wisconsin. 
Both were activists swept up in the cultural and political tumult of the 60s and 70s, and saw oppor­tunities for Chinese-Americans to assert themselves. The pair joined a pioneering Asian-American arts and political organisation called Basement Workshop and began to amass documents and artefacts. 
""People thought of me as a librarian for a long time, and not in a good way,"" says Tchen. 
Lai says, ""Stuff was being thrown out into the streets: photographs, letters, leather suitcases. The new people coming into Chinatown had no idea. Nobody cared before, but once somebody looks at it, it becomes valuable."" 
The pair formed the Chinatown History Project, in 1980, moving into 70 Mulberry Street four years later with the initial goal of interviewing and recording the senior generation - the labourers who had toiled all their working lives in laundries and restaurants, and the seamstresses of the then-ubiquitous sweatshops in Chinatown. Their early exhibitions were held in a senior citizens' centre and a public library. ""Old-timers would walk up the stairs and start telling stories about the people in the photos,"" Tchen recalls. 
For almost a century up to 1965, New York's Chinatown had been an ethnic enclave of a few thousand people, mostly men, but with the lifting of the national-origins quota for immigration and the commitment to family reunification explicit in the new laws, the Chinese population exploded. 
In 1991, the Chinatown History Project changed its name to the Chinatown History Museum and then, in 1995, to the Museum of Chinese in America. In 2009, it moved into its present, much-larger space on Centre Street, driven by its expanding archives and, as Lai says, the need for ""people to buy this idea that the museum can be nationally respectable. Otherwise it's just a dead thing"". 
Both Lai and Tchen eventually left Moca to pursue other projects. Lai led several community organisations and worked for the city government while Tchen became a university professor. Neither is currently involved in the museum's operations, but when word reached them on a cold January night that 70 Mulberry Street was on fire, their responses were visceral. 
""I was thinking of Paris and Notre Dame,"" Tchen says, referring to the fire that ravaged the iconic French landmark last year. And Lai promised to ""move heaven and hell"" to recover Moca's collections. 
After the January 23 fire, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio visited the site, declaring that ""70 Mulberry Street is a pillar of Chinatown, and I stand with the entire community as recovery efforts continue. We will do every­thing in our power to help these incredible orga­nisa­tions rebuild and bring this historic building back to life"". 
Workers erected a wooden fence, closing off Bayard and Mulberry streets, and on January 28, five days after the fire, a group of stern-faced men gathered at the burnt-out site. They represented myriad city agencies: the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS); Housing, Preservation and Development (HPD); the Department of Buildings (DOB); the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP); and the police and fire services. 
Balford Davis, a supervising demolition inspector for HPD, said, ""Private contractors will take free-standing walls out, the building itself is still sound."" One of those contractors, who refused to give his name, said, ""They don't know what to do yet, but they are very concerned with the artefacts. Every little piece will be saved."" 
The museum started a GoFundMe that eventually raised more than US$450,000 from 1,800 individual donors, with much of that doubled by a matching fund. Yao Maasbach also received an unsolicited cheque for US$50,000 from the Museum of Food and Drink. 
Yuh-Line Niou, New York State assemblywoman for the neighbourhood and the first Chinese-American to be elected to that position, says, ""I called the mayor. I was calling all the organisations to connect, to give me a rundown of how to respond to this with which city agencies. A city-owned building has to be managed in the city-owned way. But within 48 hours we made sure that people could operate."" 
Moca was informed that the operation to remove its items from the building would begin on January 29, and to prepare, dozens of volunteers arrived to process the objects: former staff, artists, museum employees and members of Moca's extensive network. 
Quintin Haynes, executive deputy commissioner of DCAS, led the effort at 70 Mulberry Street, where a small group of contractors in full hazmat suits went into the building and removed archive boxes one at a time. Ma, as chief curator of the museum, opened each box as it came out to note the contents and assess their condition. 
Some were judged in good enough shape to be passed to the waiting volunteers. Water-damaged documents and photographs were placed into a special freezer truck to be flash-frozen and then flash-thawed, the moisture turning directly from ice into steam without first becoming water. 
Several hundred cardboard boxes emerged under the lenses of waiting television cameras. Irreplaceable copies of the Chinese-American Times, an early immigrant news­paper, were intact. Costumes donated by a Chinese opera troupe were smoke-infused but undamaged. 
Lai and Tchen stood behind a police barricade, quietly watching the operation in progress. They were joined by Ava Chin, who had donated to Moca her great-grandfather's 1914 steamship ticket as well as his Exclusion-era identi­fication papers. 
Back at the museum, volunteers threw away water­logged wrappings and carefully relabelled, photographed and recatalogued each item. Volunteer Lindsey Hobbs, head of conservation and preservation at New York City Municipal Archives, said, ""Seven-hundred items out, they looked pretty good. Wet, but not terrible."" 
The recovery continued on January 31. Some objects, such as the papier mache sculptures made by survivors of the 1993 Golden Venture shipwreck, detained for years by US immigration authorities, were fragile and considered most at risk but had sustained only minor damage. Yao Maasbach's mood began to shift from fear and trepidation to guarded optimism, in the belief that the legacy of what she called ""the history of people excluded"" would be preserved. 
Over the following days and weeks, as the initial euphoria wore off, anxiety returned. Frustration gave way to stirrings of panic. By late February, there had been no more action from the city nor were there any concrete plans to save the items that still remained at 70 Mulberry Street. 
Icicles hung from the eaves as the invaluable objects continued to be exposed to the elements and deteriorate. News reports had recorded the joyful sights of the first items to be saved, but as Ma clarifies, ""We only got 20 per cent out, and it all should have been done in 48 to 72 hours. Nothing was really dry, and time was important."" 
Amy Chin, a community activist, historian and genea­logist, said the ""recovery is taking too long now that it's no longer in the spotlight. If it had been the Met [New York's premier arts institution], all the contents would've been rescued by now"". 
On February 25, Moca invited a small group of ""neighbours and community leaders"" to discuss the situation. A projection on the conference-room screen declaring ""Our Stories Count!"" in large, bold type welcomed the dozen or so attendees, who included veterans of city agencies as well as community activists and business­people. Yao Maasbach made an impassioned plea to get the remainder of the historic items out of 70 Mulberry Street. ""There are 350 family collections,"" she said, ""our identity is in that collection."" 
She stressed the museum's commitment to continuing and completing a digital edition of the archive, which they had begun before the fire. She was grateful that ""every major museum has helped. People do care about our stories and our history"". Plans were made for a public march and rally to bring the museum's plight back into the public eye. 
Moca was informed the next day that the recovery would be completed soon. According to the museum's public statement, ""the constant drumbeat to save Moca's collections was heard loud and clear in City Hall. This is not just a victory for Moca. This is a victory for the entire community, for Chinatown, for every family whose life stories enrich the American narrative."" 
Haynes and his team returned at dawn on March 8. Forming a human chain, workers were able to remove items much faster than before. These included large street and window signs from defunct Chinatown businesses, once the visual landscape of the neighbourhood. By the end of the day, the long-delayed task had been completed. 
The museum was fortunate that more than 95 per cent of its remaining items were recovered on March 8, because the coronavirus would soon sweep through New York, leading Moca to close its doors to the public on March 13. 
Like other institutions, Moca has scrambled to adapt to the pandemic by increasing its digital pro­grammes. It has also launched an initiative called the ""OneWorld Covid-19 Special Collection"", asking Chinese-Americans to submit oral histories, texts, photographs, videos and other items documenting their pandemic experience, including the rise in hate crimes against Asian-Americans. 
""Moca stands against racism,"" says Yao Maasbach, ""and works tirelessly to share these painful episodes and document the occurrences."" 
Beset by multiple crises this Year of the Metal Rat, the museum's mission has, perhaps, come full circle: as an activist project documenting the struggles of the Chinese community. Reflecting on what Moca ultimately means to him, Lai says, ""This is our history, living history, immi­grants, Americans, all of us. To do right by our forebears.""

118,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_751/Files (250).DOCX","Newstex Blogs",2020-10-21,"1878 words",NA,NA,NA,"Prepared Remarks of Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen at U.S. Department of State Conference on 'Ancient Hatred, Modern Medium: A Conference on Internet Anti-Semitism'",FALSE,"Oct 21, 2020( Justice Department News: https://www.justice.gov/justice-news Delivered by Newstex) I want to first thank Secretary Pompeo and Special Envoy Carr for hosting this conference and for inviting me to participate.As we have heard, the Internet is just the latest outlet for the 'oldest hatred.' The litany of attacks on the Jewish people has gone on through every era of history. We should not be surprised then--even though it saddens us--that it is part of our modern world. And, since that world depends on the Internet for communication, commerce, and daily life, anti-Semites can use it for their purposes as much as anyone else can use it for legitimate causes.Given this history and the reality of our dependence on technology, perhaps we will find ourselves unable to permanently sever the connection between anti-Semitism and the Internet. 
But as Rabbi Tarfon says in the Mishnah's Ethics of the Fathers, 'It is not incumbent on you to complete the work, but neither can you desist from doing it.'So they key thing I want to make clear today is that the Department of Justice will not tolerate anti-Semitic acts that violate federal law, whether they occur on the Internet or elsewhere.As the title for today's conference suggests, we face an unfortunate and uncomfortable truth: anti-Semitism remains a serious problem, and one that seems to have worsened over the last decade in terms of violent incidents. For example, in April of this year, the Department of Justice announced an arrest and charges for attempted arson at a Jewish assisted living facility in Massachusetts.It is also disturbing that anti-Semitism seems increasingly prevalent in public discourse. Sometimes it comes from the usual suspects, like neo-Nazis, followers of Louis Farrakhan, or BDS activists, but other times we are startled to see it from more respected sources. Consider when an NFL star like DeSean Jackson tweeted a fake Hitler quote about Jews controlling America, and was endorsed and defended by former NBA player Stephen Jackson. Or when someone who claimed to be a civil rights advocate, like Rodney Muhammad, posted an anti-Semitic cartoon on his public Facebook page.Now, let me also add that not every reference to Jewish people is anti-Semitic; for example, I reject the assertion that every criticism of political activities funded by George Soros is anti-Semitic. In addition, there are times that bigoted statements are animated by ignorance, rather than malice, and are followed by a willingness to stand corrected and to learn, as appears to be the case in one or two recent incidents.But the problems on the Internet go beyond abhorrent expressions. The outbreak of 'zoombombing' is another illustration. Zoombombing occurs when someone uninvited interrupts and disrupts a videoconference. Some zoombombing may be relatively harmless, such as when a co-worker's child makes a guest appearance. Other instances, however, are far more troubling. Zoombombers have targeted hateful or threatening messages at synagogue services, scripture classes, school board meetings in areas with large Jewish populations, and a rally for a Jewish candidate running for Lieutenant Governor of Vermont. All anti-Semitic incidents are offensive and unacceptable, but not all rise to the level of federal crimes. Some do. Those include violence, plots to commit violence, and other crimes against synagogues and religious property. Let me mention two real cases that involve use of the internet:One involved an online chat group, where just in the last month, a member of a white supremacist group called Atomwaffen pled guilty to federal charges for conspiring and making threats of violence targeted at black and Jewish journalists, as well as members of the Anti-Defamation League.In another, last November a man was charged with a federal hate crime for threating to blow up a synagogue in Pueblo, Colorado. He allegedly organized much of his plot online, and repeatedly expressed his hatred of Jewish people and his desire to destroy the synagogue.Addressing this disturbing rise of anti-Semitism is a priority of the Justice Department. Let me briefly mention a few steps we have taken.First, the Department has been listening to, and learning from, the Jewish community. Last summer, the Attorney General convened the first-ever DOJ Summit on Combating Anti-Semitism, which brought together 150 community leaders and allies. This year the Attorney General also travelled to Brooklyn to meet with a group of Jewish leaders to hear their concerns about a wave of anti-Semitic attacks in New York City.Second, we want Jewish communities to know where to report potential crimes. Earlier this year, the Attorney General directed U.S. Attorneys to reach out to Jewish leaders in their districts, to assure them of support and to provide them with personal contacts for reporting anti-Semitic hate crimes.Third, and most importantly, we have prioritized investigating and prosecuting anti-Semitic crimes. Faith-based communities have been targeted in their places of worship, their grocery stores, and their community centers. One report cited 234 incidents targeting synagogues and community centers in 2019. By now, some of the worst cases have become well-known: the Pittsburgh Tree of Life murder of 11 worshipers, the Chabad of Poway California synagogue shootings that killed one and injured 53 others, and the Jersey City murders where two individuals, after killing a police detective, drove to a kosher grocery store and murdered the owner, a worker, and a customer before being killed in a shootout with the police.As these and other cases demonstrate, the Department of Justice has not hesitated to bring hate crime charges and other federal charges in response to anti-Semitic crimes. Since January 2017, the Department has charged over 80 defendants with federal hate crimes and related conduct. In the same time frame, the Department of Justice has obtained convictions of over 65 defendants for the same.So this brings me back to the topic of the Internet, and what role the Justice Department can play beyond the deadly cases I have already mentioned. And when the issue is solely one of what things people say, we have to acknowledge the need for more education and changing hearts and minds.The reason is that the Department vigorously enforces and protects the Constitutional rights of all our citizens, so our efforts must remain consistent with the First Amendment and its guarantees of free expression, as construed by the Supreme Court. Given that, no matter how much we are disgusted by anti-Semitism, we do not and cannot impinge on free speech, even the most offensive by the most odious of speakers. When dealing with things that involve or implicate speech, the Department is limited to prosecuting crimes that fall under recognized categories of unprotected speech, or otherwise satisfy the First Amendment's exacting standards.The Department can and does prosecute what the Supreme Court has called 'true threats,' that is, 'a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals.' Where anti-Semitic tirades constitute true threats, federal prosecution can both punish and deter such conduct.For example, in March of this year federal agents arrested a self-proclaimed white nationalist in Washington state who allegedly posted anti-Semitic rants about the victim online, including threats to kill the victim and others. That individual was charged with making interstate threats and cyberstalking. The case is scheduled for trial later this year.The First Amendment also offers no protection for speech that is integral to criminal conduct. In the context of anti-Semitism on the Internet, this means that the Department will not hesitate to prosecute those who cyberstalk, extort, cyberhack, defraud, or otherwise commit crimes in the course of their hateful screeds.Sometimes it can be difficult to parse whether an incident of anti-Semitism rises to the level of a federal crime. For example, is zoombombing a federal crime? It depends. Although zoombombing is generally disruptive and unwelcome, whether the conduct rises to the level of criminal behavior will turn on very specific facts. Investigators must consider whether a true threat was made, whether there was criminal harassment or stalking, whether there was intentional unauthorized access to, or damage to, a computer, or if another criminal statute was violated.Not all anti-Semitism will meet the standard of a federal crime. But, make no mistake, the Department of Justice and the Administration as a whole have unequivocally condemned hateful attacks against Jews. And we have prosecuted them when they involved violations of federal criminal laws, including hate crimes and true threats of violence, among others.I'd like to suggest, however, that at least in the realm of the law, we should look to find a better term than 'hate speech', as that term can cover some things that are protected by the First Amendment and some that are not, so it has not proven very useful. And sometimes the term 'hate speech' has been used to label whatever the person using the phrase doesn't like. It has become too easy to label political speech as such. The vagueness and malleability of what counts as 'hate' could wrongly be deployed to shut down constitutionally protected speech. I have seen some harsh criticism of political leaders that did not sound much like love or affection. Likewise, the label might be used against speech that challenges prevailing orthodoxies or politically correct ideas, but is deemed objectionable by someone who does not wish to hear dissent or opposition. We should not want honest debate silenced, or even heated disagreements about public policy, schools, society, or other public issues. Instead, the concern we ought to have is about vile attacks on people based on illegitimate group stereotypes that constitute threats of violence, or generate actual violence, or other unlawful actions.On the Internet, as elsewhere, threats and violence have no safe haven. But on the Internet, we have to find ways to condemn genuine bigotry and prejudice while still tolerating disagreements about public issues, and recognizing the limits of what the law can do in a free society that values free speech. Those are issues that the Department also has been considering in the context of legislative immunities that exist under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which I have publicly addressed in the past, but I will leave that topic for others today.Let me wrap up by underscoring again that, consistent with the founding principles and best traditions of our country, the United States Department of Justice stands firmly and unequivocally against anti-Semitism. We will not hesitate to take action where anti-Semitic conduct rises to the level of a federal crime. That is as true online as it is offline. We have no tolerance for that behavior and will continue to prosecute such conduct as appropriate. Most importantly, we will continue to uphold the rule of law for all Americans. Thank you again for inviting me to participate in today's important conference. "

Keywords: fear of crime; lesbians and gay men; victimization; perceived risk; sexual minorities During the past two decades, a growing body of research has focused on describing, defining, and explaining fear of crime. Although findings have been equivocal, in general, research has suggested women and the elderly (e.g., Bennett & Flavin, 1994; McGarrell, Giacomazzi, & Thurman, 1997) are more likely to fear victimization. Within this research, much has been made of the apparent disjuncture between the levels of fear of victim- ization expressed by women and the elderly and their actual experiences of victimization as documented in victimization surveys and official crime Journal of Interpersonal Violence Volume 22 Number 2 February 2007 198-217 © 2007 Sage Publications 10.1177/0886260506295346 http://jiv.sagepub.com hosted at http://online.sagepub.com Author's Note: Please address all correspondence to Melanie D.

Whereas this disjuncture has been characterized as an irrational fear of an unlikely event, some efforts to explain the phenomenon have argued that the higher levels of fear expressed can be attributed, at least in part, to greater physical vulnerability felt by individuals in these groups. The vulnerability hypothesis has been but one of many arguments forwarded to explain this paradox (e.g., Hough & Mayhew, 1983). More recently, however, some researchers have questioned the suggestion that physical vulnerability to potential victimization is the exclusive or even pri- mary explanation for increased levels of fear found among women. Instead, it has been suggested that conceptual and methodological flaws in victim- ization research may fail to capture many of the sources of women's fear of victimization--and thus fail to count numerous actual experiences of ver- bal and/or physical aggression that generally fall outside the parameters of many studies. For instance, Pain (1997) argues that the pervasiveness of domestic violence and sexual harassment serve to create a climate in which women feel fearful of a broad range of potential threats. When coupled with prevailing social attitudes that seem to ignore if not condone these daily threats, women are left feeling socially isolated and marginalized by this ever-present risk of violation. Against this backdrop, a woman's expressed fear of victimization may ultimately be in line with her lived experience of being the target of a myriad of verbal and/or physical attacks. As efforts to untangle and clarify these relationships have been under- taken, the vast majority of research has focused on individuals who are either specifically identified as or presumed to be heterosexual. As a result, much less is known about the experiences of victimization and its consequences for lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, and transgender (LGBT) persons--individuals who are arguably particularly vulnerable to potential victimization because of their marginalized and stigmatized status as sexual minorities (Pain, 1991, 2000). Although not specifically focused on fear of victimization and poten- tial predictors of such fear, during the past decade, a limited amount of work has begun to explore other aspects of victimization among sexual minorities (e.g., Comstock, 1991; Herek & Berrill, 1992; Herek, Cogan, & Gillis, 2002; Otis & Skinner, 1996). Extant work on the impact of victimization in the lives of LGBT persons highlights both similarities and differences in relation to experiences of non-LGBT persons. Similarities and differences that Pain and others suggest may be attributable to the impact of social exclusion and oppression. Against this backdrop, the current study seeks to explore the rela- tionship between a number of previously studied predictors (i.e., gender, age, past victimization, neighborhood incivilities, and population density) and perceptions of risk of victimization and fear of victimization among members Otis / Lesbians and Gay Men 199 of a particularly vulnerable and marginalized population--self-identified lesbians and gay men living in a rural state. Literature Review Fear of Victimization and Perceptions of Risk One area in which there has been substantial debate focuses on defini- tional and conceptual problems relating to the study of fear of victimiza- tion. Increasingly, researchers have argued that much of the disparity in findings identified in past research can be attributed to flawed measures and a failure to distinguish between multiple dimensions of threats of victim- ization (Wilcox Rountree, 1998). Explorations of the seemingly paradoxical relationship between gender, age, and fear of crime have fueled efforts to clarify the distinction between fear of victimization and perceived risk of victimization (Ferraro & LaGrange, 1987; Warr, 1987). Within this literature, risk assessments are viewed as largely a cognitive evaluative process, the outcome of which influences one's emotional response of feeling fearful. Ferraro and LaGrange (1987, 1992) argue that past measures failed to distinguish between one's awareness of like- lihood of victimization and the psychological response to feelings of fear, thus contributing to misinterpretations and/or misattributions of age and gender dif- ferences in levels of fear. Their research suggests that young people in general, and young men specifically, believe that they are, in fact, at higher risk for vic- timization than their elderly counterparts. This cognitive perception of risk did not, however, translate to a consistent emotional response of fear of victim- ization. The disjuncture is partly explained by differences in individuals' per- ceptions of their vulnerability to potentially negative consequences as a result of being victimized. Two concerns are highlighted by extant research. First, the authors argue that past research suggesting that older people are more fearful of crime than younger people might have failed to actually measure fear of victim- ization (Ferraro & LaGrange, 1987). Specifically, they propose that a cog- nitive perception of one's crime risk should be treated as a distinct factor separate from a concept of fear of victimization. Second, their work sug- gests that perception of risk of victimization should be conceptualized as an intervening variable mediating the relationship between various sociode- mographic variables, indirect and direct victimization, neighborhood inci- vilities, and the subsequent outcome of fear of crime (Ferraro, 1995; Ferraro & LaGrange, 1987). 200 Journal of Interpersonal Violence Individual, Lifestyle, and Contextual Factors As previously noted, research suggests that perceived risk of victimiza- tion and expressed levels of fear often vary based on a number of micro- level variables such as gender, age, and race. Efforts to articulate the meaning of that link between sociodemographic variables and fear of vic- timization (e.g., LaGrange & Ferraro, 1989; Warr, 1990) have focused on similarities and differences that can be found in the routine daily activities (Cohen & Felson, 1979) and lifestyle patterns (Hindelang, Gottfredson, & Garafalo, 1978) of individuals who share similar demographic profiles. One interpretation of these findings suggests that these individual-level fac- tors are indicators of meaningful patterns of exposure to potential victim- ization that relate to commonalties found in the lifestyles of individuals with shared demographic profiles and similar types and levels of activity (e.g., going to bars, staying home; Cohen & Felson, 1979). The similarities in lifestyle patterns and routine daily activities translate into variations in the likelihood that one will encounter a motivated offender, and thus, expe- rience victimization. Recent research examining individuals' efforts to reduce their potential risk of victimization have focused on many of these same factors. For instance, studies have found that women may reduce the amount of time spent engaging in particular activities and/or the amount of time they spend in certain venues in an effort to reduce their potential for victimization (Pain, 1997; Painter, 1992). Past experiences with victimization also play a role in perceptions of victimization risk and fear of future victimization. Whereas some research has suggested that any form of victimization may potentially lead to a global increase in fear, Wilcox Rountree (1998) found support for a distinct offense-specific impact on victimization concerns. In her study of Seattle neighborhoods, she found that violent personal victimization increased concerns for both future personal and property victimization but failed to find a similar impact for past experiences of burglary. One potential expla- nation for this finding may lie in the potential for trauma associated with direct (personal) victimization. As such, the impact of personal victimiza- tion may be more pervasive than the more impersonal experience of bur- glary or other property-related crimes (Wilcox Rountree, 1998). Contextual factors and spatial characteristics also play an important role in predicting perceived risk and fear of crime. For instance, higher levels of fear of victimization have also been found among individuals living in areas characterized by community disorder (LaGrange, Ferraro, & Supancic, 1992; Skogan & Maxfield, 1981). Both physical and social aspects of communities Otis / Lesbians and Gay Men 201 become important factors in understanding differences in people's perceptions of their risk of being victimized and their feelings of fearfulness (Bennett & Flavin, 1994; Wilson & Kelling, 1982). Signs of neighborhood incivility reflect a broader set of concerns that might exist in a given community, suggesting that fear of crime may reflect perceptions of an overall problem of commu- nity disorganization. Independent of any personal contact with victimiza- tion, many individuals may presume a high crime rate if a number of signs of community decay and disorder exist (LaGrange et al., 1992). LaGrange and colleagues also found these indicators of neighborhood incivility to be stronger predictors of perceived risk of victimization than fear of crime. Similarly, Wilcox Rountree and Land (1996) found neighborhood incivili- ties to increase fear of crime among respondents who were actually aware of specific cases of victimization. Thus, independent of variations in risk that might accompany diverse social statuses and participation in high- or low- risk activities, the community context provides residents with additional information that may contribute to perceptions of risk and fearfulness. Prior research has also identified population density as a predictor of variation in levels of fear of crime (Liska, Lawrence, & Sanchirico, 1982; Skogan & Maxfield, 1981). Changing patterns of population migration and increases in population density may lead to feelings of disconnect from one's neighbors. Thus, higher rates of fear of crime found in metropolitan areas have been attributed, in part, to this sense of disconnect or alienation that may be felt by urban inhabitants (Skogan, 1986). Fear of Victimization Among Sexual Minorities To date, little is known about the factors that predict fear of crime among sexual minorities. In a study of the impact of victimization on a sample of lesbians and gay men, Otis and Skinner (1996) documented the deleterious effects of past victimization on mental well-being. The relationship, how- ever, between victimization risks and predictor variables was not a part of the study. Similarly, whereas Herek and colleagues (2002) have provided some insight into the characteristics of crimes experienced by LGB persons-- with a specific focus on the experience of hate crimes--their research did not explore the relationship between victimization experiences and future concerns relating to risk and/or fear of subsequent victimization. To begin to address these gaps in the literature, this study tests offense- specific factors related to fear of personal and property crime among a sample of lesbians and gay men living in a rural state. The analysis includes both individual and contextual factors that relate to lifestyle, routine activities, 202 Journal of Interpersonal Violence past victimization experience, and neighborhood characteristics. Past vic- timization experience (personal and property), perceived neighborhood disorder, participation in high-risk (alcohol-related and nonalcohol-related) and low-risk daily activities, and lifestyle- and exposure-related sociodemo- graphic variables are included as exogenous variables. Drawing on extant lit- erature, perception of risk and fear of victimization are examined separately. Thus, this study seeks to contribute to our knowledge of fear of victimiza- tion among lesbians and gay men by addressing the following questions: (a) Do different factors predict fear of victimization versus perception of victimization risk? and (b) Are there offense-specific (personal versus prop- erty victimization) differences in levels of fear of future victimization? Method Participants and Procedures Respondents for this study are a nonprobability sample of self-defined lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals living in households located in and around two metropolitan cities in a southern state (2000 county popula- tion sizes were 250,000 and 683,000). Participants were recruited using a multipronged approach, including organizational mailing lists, snowball sampling, and a convenience sample at a local LGBT Pride gathering. Two hundred ninety-eight self-identified lesbians and gay men partici- pated in the study. Respondents ranged in age from 19 to 75 years, with an average age of 35.7 years and an average number of 15.4 years of edu- cation. The sample was 42.6% lesbian and 57.3% gay male, and the majority of the respondents described themselves as White (93.9%). The median individual income was between $15,000 and $19,999, and 74.5% of the sample indicated that they were employed full time. The majority of the sample indicated that they were currently in a same-sex relation- ship (61.7%), with slightly fewer than half (48.7%) indicating that they currently lived with their same-sex partner. Slightly more than three fourths (78%) of the sample indicated that they lived in a city (more than 250,000 people) or suburb, and 12.2% lived in rural areas or small towns (fewer than 10,000 people). This study is part of a larger longitudinal study that examined a myriad of social issues and experiences impacting the lives of lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals living in the state. Regardless of how they were contacted (organizational mailing lists, a snowball sample involving community Otis / Lesbians and Gay Men 203 members, or at the community event), respondents completed an anony- mous self-report survey and returned it to the principal investigator. Measures Fear of personal and property victimization. Fear of victimization is based on a measure suggested by Ferraro and LaGrange (1987). For each of nine items, a Likert-type scale was used (1 = not afraid at all to 10 = very afraid) to indicate the degree to which the respondents were afraid of becoming victims of specific types of crime. Fear-of-personal-victimization items included ""How afraid are you of someone . . . taking something from you by force . . . beating you up . . . sexually assaulting you?"" Items measuring fear of property crime included ""How afraid are you of . . . having something stolen from you while you are away from home . . . having your property vandalized?"" Perceived risk of victimization. Respondents were also asked to rate the likelihood of experiencing personal or property victimization. Two indices measuring perceived risk of personal victimization and perceived risk of property victimization were constructed based on the same series of state- ments used to construct the fear-of-personal-victimization and fear-of- property-victimization indices. For the series of statements, respondents rated on a scale of 1 (not at all likely) to 10 (very likely) the likelihood that they would in fact be victims of specific types of victimization, such as being sexually assaulted by someone of the opposite sex, being verbally abused, or having property vandalized. Lifestyle, Routine Activities, and Social-Context Variables To assess past experiences of personal victimization, respondents indi- cated whether each of 13 different types of victimization had happened dur- ing the past 2 years (no = 0, yes = 1). Victimization that occurred in face-to-face interaction, such as physical or sexual assault, threats of vio- lence, and robbery, are combined to create a dichotomous measure of per- sonal (contact) victimization (0 = no personal victimization, 1 = one or more experiences). Noncontact victimization such as burglary and vandal- ism of personal property are combined to create a dichotomous measure of property (noncontact) victimization (0 = no property victimization, 1 = one or more experiences). Based on past findings examining the offense-specific nature of fear of victimization, past victimization experience (either personal 204 Journal of Interpersonal Violence Otis / Lesbians and Gay Men 205 or property) is expected to be positively related to fear of personal victim- ization. However, only property victimization is expected to be predictive of fear of property victimization. Routine activities. Research suggests that a number of individual-level, lifestyle-related variables may impact an individual's risk of victimization. In keeping with arguments suggested by Cohen and Felson (1979) and Garofalo (1987), frequency of participation in activities that take place in high-risk public space, or ""hot spots"" of crime, as well as time spent in less risky public activities and time spent at home are included in the analysis as indicators of victimization opportunity. Responses ranged from 1, indi- cating no participation, to 7, indicating participation many times per week. Taken together, these micro-level lifestyle/exposure and routine-activity measures may provide a clearer picture of probable victimization risks that might elicit feelings of fear from respondents. Participation in high-risk activities is expected to positively relate to fear of personal and property victimization. Conversely, time spent at home (low-risk activity) is expected to negatively relate to fear of victimization. Individual characteristics. Based on past research, four individual-level variables were included to assess lifestyle/vulnerability factors. These vari- ables included gender (dummy coded, male = 1), age (continuous, range = 19 to 75 years), relationship status (dummy coded, single = 1), and personal income (ordinal, 1 = no earnings to 12 = more than $50,000 per year). Ecological context. Neighborhood incivility is measured with a series of questions addressing perceived problems in the immediate neighborhood environment. The neighborhood-problems scale (range = 9 to 27) included questions that asked, ""How great a problem are . . . trash and litter . . . loose dogs . . . inconsiderate or disruptive neighbors . . ."" and so on. Each problem is coded 1 = not at all, 2 = somewhat, and 3 = serious (Cronbach's alpha = ­.80). Perceived neighborhood incivilities are expected to relate to increased levels of fear of victimization. Population density was assessed as (a) rural farm, (b) rural nonfarm, (c) town (fewer than 10,000), (d) small city (10,000 to 100,000), (e) suburb, or (f) city (more than 100,000). Past research supports a positive relation- ship between increased population density and fear of crime. However, many LGBT persons move from rural areas because of fear of discrimination and victimization. Thus, fear of crime is expected to negatively relate to popu- lation density for this sample. 206 Journal of Interpersonal Violence Results Descriptive Information and Analytic Plan Analysis began with the examination of bivariate relationships among all study variables. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analyses were used to explore the relationships between individual-level and contextual factors and perceived risk and fear of victimization. All analyses were com- pleted using SPSS version 11.0. Table 1 contains zero-order correlations, means, and standard deviations for all study variables. Six of the 10 vari- ables demonstrated significant bivariate relationships with the dependent variable. Of note, the relationships between fear of personal victimization and gender, being single, spending time home alone, and population den- sity were not significant. The strongest bivariate relationship exists between fear of personal victimization and perceived risk of victimization (r = .724). Predicting Fear of Personal Victimization Path analysis, including personal victimization, routine activities, con- textual factors, individual characteristics, and perceived risk of victimiza- tion, was conducted to test the fully recursive model predicting fear of personal victimization (see Table 2). Direct effects were calculated by regressing fear of personal victimization on the 10 predictors in the equa- tion. In this analysis, only neighborhood incivilities ( = .158, p .001) and perceived risk of personal victimization ( = .660, p .001) were signifi- cant predictors. Largely because of the influence of perceived risk of vic- timization on fear of personal victimization, the model explained 55.4% of the variance in fear of personal victimization. Because perceived risk of personal victimization is conceptualized as an intervening variable in the model, a second analysis regressed fear of per- sonal victimization on the remaining nine factors. After removing perceived risk of personal victimization from the analysis, four of the nine remaining variables made significant contributions to the overall model. The percep- tion of neighborhood incivilities continued to be the strongest predictor, and those perceiving greater neighborhood problems had higher levels of fear of personal victimization ( = .333, p .001). In addition, past experience of personal victimization ( = .182, p .05), personal income ( = ­.841, p .001), and gender ( = ­.122, p .05) all made significant contributions in the expected directions. Further decomposition of the paths found notable indirect effects on fear of personal victimization for past personal victimization ( = .178), time Table1 Zero-orderedCorrelations,Means,andStandardDeviationsforallStudyVariables(N==272) 12345678910MeanSD 1.Victimization1.00.20.40 2.Lesbian/gaybars.194**1.003.351.75 3.Homealone­.067.151*1.005.621.52 4.Incivility.272**.114*­.152*1.0011.462.76 5.Populationdensity­.004.092.175*.0531.004.281.27 6.Gender.030.239**.118*.081­.0891.00.57.50 7.Age­.132*­.270**.073­.182*­.002.0491.0034.669.77 8.Single.029.114*.058.073­.105.323**­.0431.00.34.47 9.Personalincome­.155**­.105.006­.169*­.059.007.351**­.0921.006.912.68 10.Perceivedrisk.373**.157*.024.348**­.089­.011­.199**.016­.246**1.0013.778.33 11.Fearofvictimization.296**.117*­.004.383**­.026­.072­.145*­.015­.230**.724**28.9315.04 *p.05;**p.001. 207 Table2 OLSRegressionUnstandardizedCoefficients,StandardErrors,andStandardized CoefficientsforModelPredictingFearofPersonalVictimizationandFearofPropertyVictimization AmongLesbiansandGayMen(N==272) FearofPersonalVictimizationFearofPropertyVictimization b/s.e.b/s.e.b/s.e.b/s.e.

The effect of gender on fear of personal victimization was largely direct, with no significant gender dif- ferences found for perceived risk of personal victimization (see Table 3). This finding is in contrast with past research indicating that men recognize themselves to be at greater risk than women, whereas women express higher levels of fear. Only the latter was supported in this study. The find- ing related to population density is also noteworthy for its contrast to past research. The relationship between fear of personal victimization and pop- ulation density was as hypothesized, with levels of fear decreasing as pop- ulation density increased. Fear of Property Victimization OLS regression analysis was also used to examine the relationship between fear of property victimization, experiences of property victimiza- tion, routine activities, contextual factors, and individual characteristics (Table 2). Only neighborhood incivilities ( = .301, p .05) and past prop- erty victimization ( = .240, p .05) were significantly predictive of fear of property victimization (Adj. R2 = .173). The inclusion of risk of property victimization as an intervening variable increased the explanatory ability of the model significantly (Adj. R2 = .522). Whereas past experience of prop- erty victimization remained significant ( = .100, p .05), the majority of the variance in fear of property victimization was explained by perceived risk ( = .651, p .05). An examination of the decomposed paths further clarifies the role of neighborhood incivilities on fear of property victimization; the majority of its effect came indirectly through variance of perceived risk of victimization. This finding suggests that individuals sensing a higher level of neighborhood incivilities are more likely to feel fearful of victimization largely as a result of their evaluation of potential risk (Wilcox Rountree, 1998). Offense-Specific Fear of Victimization A final set of analyses was undertaken to explore the question of the importance of viewing fear of victimization as offense specific (Wilcox Rountree, 1998); separate analyses examined the influence of past personal-victimization experience on fear of property victimization and past property victimization on fear of personal victimization (see Table 4).

Unlike past studies, property victimization ( = .149) was a significant predictor of fear of personal victimization. Similar to past research, higher levels of reported neighborhood incivilities and lower levels of reported personal income sig- nificantly predicted an increase in fear of personal victimization. The inclu- sion of personal-victimization experience in the equation predicting fear of personal victimization had little impact on the overall findings. In the final analysis including all variables, the strongest effect was for perceived risk of victimization ( = .682), again supporting the suggestion that fear is mediated by current risk evaluations, independent of past victimization experiences. In the analysis examining effect of past experience of personal victimiza- tion on fear of property crime, findings were also in contrast to those reported in previous studies that have suggested that past experiences of personal vic- timization lead to increased fear of both personal and property victimization (Wilcox Rountree, 1998). Specifically, personal victimization failed to signif- icantly affect fear of property crime. Past property victimization ( = .102), neighborhood incivilities ( = .627), and perceived risk of property victim- ization ( = .097) significantly increased fear of property victimization. Discussion Past research has consistently documented higher levels of fear of both personal and property victimization for women when compared to men (Scott, 2003; Warr, 1985). Many have argued that the paradoxical reaction of fear of victimization in the absence of experiences of actual victimiza- tion can be explained by women's greater vulnerability to sexual assault and physical injury. These studies, however, have focused on predomi- nantly heterosexual samples. As such, the findings may have minimal util- ity for understanding the lived experience of many lesbians and gay men who may be more likely to be targeted for sexual and/or physical assault as a result of their stigmatized sexual-minority status. The current study sought to explore potential similarities and differences between the general population (largely heterosexual) that is typically represented in research and members of this stigmatized group. To that end, the author explored the relationship between a number of individual-level factors (i.e., gender, age, income), lifestyle factors (i.e., going to bars), and contextual factors (i.e., neighborhood incivilities) and perceptions of victimization risk and fear of victimization in a nonprobability sample of self-identified lesbians and gay men living in a rural state. Otis / Lesbians and Gay Men 213 Consistent with past research, women in the study were found to be more fearful of personal victimization than were men. It is notable, how- ever, that the effect of gender was low and fairly equally balanced in terms of indirect and direct effects. Additionally, unlike many past studies, the men and women in the study perceived themselves to be at similar levels of risk. A number of factors may serve to balance lesbians' and gay men's per- ceptions of potential risk of victimization. First, the potential for gay men to be targeted for hate crimes may serve to negate many of the arguments suggested about the source of male-female differences in concerns about potential vulnerability to victimization. In other words, gay men's increased likelihood of being targeted for sexual violence as well as physical and/or verbal assault may serve to narrow the gender-gap that is typically found in victimization and fear-of-crime research involving the general population. Simultaneously, it can be argued that many of the same sociocultural fac- tors that contribute to women's sense of vulnerability, social isolation, and exclusion within society are evident in the lives of gay men. For lesbians, however, social isolation and vulnerability to harassment and threats of vic- timization may be magnified by their devalued status both as women and sexual minorities. These assessments are largely speculative, however, and suggest the need for continued exploration of the relationship between gender and fear of crime. The importance of lifestyle factors relating to individual characteristics (i.e., gender, age, income, being single) and participation in routine activities (i.e., going to bars, spending time home alone) in explaining perceptions of victimization risk was only partially supported in the analyses, though all of the relationships were in the direction hypothesized. The fact that neither age nor being single significantly contributed to explaining differences in fear of victimization may be related to certain unique aspects of the lives of lesbians and gay men. Past findings relating to these factors address antic- ipated lifestyle similarities and developmental expectations that may be less relevant for many lesbians and gay men. Whereas a complete discussion of ""coming out"" is beyond the scope of this article, developmental models articulating the process have identified a number of commonalities that hold true for most lesbians and gay men, regardless of their chronological ages. Early stages of ""coming out"" may be related to increased involvement in dating and going to clubs and bars--activities often associated with younger adults. Similarly, both single and coupled lesbians and gay men may spend time socializing in gay/lesbian bars--a core social institution in many cities--thus, potentially reducing the variation in perceived risk and fear of victimization often associated with these activities. In fact, as a pseudo­community center, bars that predominantly cater to sexual minorities 214 Journal of Interpersonal Violence may provide a sense of safety and security that is less available in other public venues. In spite of the consistent findings related to ""hot spots"" of crime and vic- timization, the current study failed to find a significant relationship between increased time spent in LGBT bars and perceived risk or fear of personal victimization. The important cultural role of the LGBT bar in the commu- nity may also explain the lack of significance of this ""high risk"" activity in this analysis. The fact that increased time spent home alone was positively related to perceived risk of victimization but not fear of personal victim- ization may relate to the potential for those who are fearful of victimization to participate in protective behaviors (Liska, Sanchirico, & Reed, 1988). This study, however, does not entirely support this contention. Past research on the impact of participation in protective behaviors has typically found that such actions relate to increased levels of fear (Scott, 2003). Whereas the relationship between staying home alone and fear of personal victim- ization was positive, it was not significant. In this case, it may be argued that having taken such action, the individuals actually contributed to increased feelings of safety. Whereas there are some significant direct effects on fear of victimization, this analysis suggests that individuals are rational actors whose fear is based on an actual perception of risk. Furthermore, for the gay men and lesbians in this study, the two strongest contributors to that perception are having expe- rienced personal and/or property victimization in the past and the presence of signs of neighborhood incivility--two factors that seem to suggest the possi- bility of victimization as a legitimate concern. Absent in this analysis is any measure of the respondent's awareness of the victimization experiences of others--a particularly relevant factor in a population that is often targeted for bias-motivated crime (Berrill, 1990; Jenness & Broad, 1997). Finally, somewhat in contrast with Wilcox Rountree's (1998) findings about the offense-specific nature of crime, we found that fear of personal or property victimization was related to having experienced similar types of victimization. Specifically, past property victimization increased feelings of risk of property victimization and fearfulness of future property crime. That concern was not carried over, however, to seemingly unrelated con- cerns for personal victimization. Limitations and Suggestions for Future Research The lesbians and gay men who participated in this project cannot be assumed to be representative of the population as a whole. We believe that the multipronged sampling approach used contributed to a sample that is arguably more diverse than those found in studies that relied on single methodologies and urban respondents, however. That said, the stigmatiza- tion and discrimination experienced by many LGBT people continues to contribute to problems of accessibility. Those who are willing to participate in research may be more ""out"" and potentially less fearful than those who are less open about their sexual-minority status. In fact, many of the same concerns that influence LGBT persons' willingness to report victimization to the police (i.e., fear of exposure, concern about loss of employment, etc.) may often influence decisions about participation in research. Whereas one of the strengths of this project is the fact that the sample of lesbians and gay men studied did not live in a large metropolitan area (e.g., San Francisco, New York City), it also raises a cautionary note in terms of past research. Many of the studies that contributed to the analytic frame- work of this project have been conducted in much larger urban areas. Given the significance of neighborhood context, future research should seek to explicate the experience of lesbians and gay men in a myriad of community settings. The study is also limited by the fact that a recently (past 2 years) mea- sure of past victimization was used. Guided by recent studies suggesting that fear-of-victimization and risk assessments may be based largely on immediate circumstances and the current environmental contexts, we focused the analysis on recent experiences. Subsequent analysis may con- sider differences in fear-of-victimization and risk assessments among indi- viduals who have experienced serious, life-threatening victimization as compared to those who have experienced other types of personal and/or property crimes, while also considering temporal effects.

ROSEN AT U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE CONFERENCE ON ""ANCIENT HATRED, MODERN MEDIUM: A CONFERENCE ON INTERNET ANTI-SEMITISM""",FALSE,"The following information was released by the U.S. Department of Justice:
Washington, DC
United States

Wednesday, October 21, 2020
I want to first thank Secretary Pompeo and Special Envoy Carr for hosting this conference and for inviting me to participate.
As we have heard, the Internet is just the latest outlet for the ""oldest hatred."" The litany of attacks on the Jewish people has gone on through every era of history. We should not be surprised then--even though it saddens us--that it is part of our modern world. And, since that world depends on the Internet for communication, commerce, and daily life, anti-Semites can use it for their purposes as much as anyone else can use it for legitimate causes.
Given this history and the reality of our dependence on technology, perhaps we will find ourselves unable to permanently sever the connection between anti-Semitism and the Internet. But as Rabbi Tarfon says in the Mishnah's Ethics of the Fathers, ""It is not incumbent on you to complete the work, but neither can you desist from doing it.""
So they key thing I want to make clear today is that the Department of Justice will not tolerate anti-Semitic acts that violate federal law, whether they occur on the Internet or elsewhere.
As the title for today's conference suggests, we face an unfortunate and uncomfortable truth: anti-Semitism remains a serious problem, and one that seems to have worsened over the last decade in terms of violent incidents. For example, in April of this year, the Department of Justice announced an arrest and charges for attempted arson at a Jewish assisted living facility in Massachusetts.
It is also disturbing that anti-Semitism seems increasingly prevalent in public discourse. Sometimes it comes from the usual suspects, like neo-Nazis, followers of Louis Farrakhan, or BDS activists, but other times we are startled to see it from more respected sources. Consider when an NFL star like DeSean Jackson tweeted a fake Hitler quote about Jews controlling America, and was endorsed and defended by former NBA player Stephen Jackson. Or when someone who claimed to be a civil rights advocate, like Rodney Muhammad, posted an anti-Semitic cartoon on his public Facebook page.
Now, let me also add that not every reference to Jewish people is anti-Semitic; for example, I reject the assertion that every criticism of political activities funded by George Soros is anti-Semitic. In addition, there are times that bigoted statements are animated by ignorance, rather than malice, and are followed by a willingness to stand corrected and to learn, as appears to be the case in one or two recent incidents.
But the problems on the Internet go beyond abhorrent expressions. The outbreak of ""zoombombing"" is another illustration. Zoombombing occurs when someone uninvited interrupts and disrupts a videoconference. Some zoombombing may be relatively harmless, such as when a co-worker's child makes a guest appearance. Other instances, however, are far more troubling. Zoombombers have targeted hateful or threatening messages at synagogue services, scripture classes, school board meetings in areas with large Jewish populations, and a rally for a Jewish candidate running for Lieutenant Governor of Vermont.
All anti-Semitic incidents are offensive and unacceptable, but not all rise to the level of federal crimes. Some do. Those include violence, plots to commit violence, and other crimes against synagogues and religious property. Let me mention two real cases that involve use of the internet:
One involved an online chat group, where just in the last month, a member of a white supremacist group called Atomwaffen pled guilty to federal charges for conspiring and making threats of violence targeted at black and Jewish journalists, as well as members of the Anti-Defamation League.
In another, last November a man was charged with a federal hate crime for threating to blow up a synagogue in Pueblo, Colorado. He allegedly organized much of his plot online, and repeatedly expressed his hatred of Jewish people and his desire to destroy the synagogue.
Addressing this disturbing rise of anti-Semitism is a priority of the Justice Department. Let me briefly mention a few steps we have taken.
First, the Department has been listening to, and learning from, the Jewish community. Last summer, the Attorney General convened the first-ever DOJ Summit on Combating Anti-Semitism, which brought together 150 community leaders and allies. This year the Attorney General also travelled to Brooklyn to meet with a group of Jewish leaders to hear their concerns about a wave of anti-Semitic attacks in New York City.
Second, we want Jewish communities to know where to report potential crimes. Earlier this year, the Attorney General directed U.S. Attorneys to reach out to Jewish leaders in their districts, to assure them of support and to provide them with personal contacts for reporting anti-Semitic hate crimes.
Third, and most importantly, we have prioritized investigating and prosecuting anti-Semitic crimes. Faith-based communities have been targeted in their places of worship, their grocery stores, and their community centers. One report cited 234 incidents targeting synagogues and community centers in 2019.
By now, some of the worst cases have become well-known: the Pittsburgh Tree of Life murder of 11 worshipers, the Chabad of Poway California synagogue shootings that killed one and injured 53 others, and the Jersey City murders where two individuals, after killing a police detective, drove to a kosher grocery store and murdered the owner, a worker, and a customer before being killed in a shootout with the police.
As these and other cases demonstrate, the Department of Justice has not hesitated to bring hate crime charges and other federal charges in response to anti-Semitic crimes. Since January 2017, the Department has charged over 80 defendants with federal hate crimes and related conduct. In the same time frame, the Department of Justice has obtained convictions of over 65 defendants for the same.
So this brings me back to the topic of the Internet, and what role the Justice Department can play beyond the deadly cases I have already mentioned. And when the issue is solely one of what things people say, we have to acknowledge the need for more education and changing hearts and minds.
The reason is that the Department vigorously enforces and protects the Constitutional rights of all our citizens, so our efforts must remain consistent with the First Amendment and its guarantees of free expression, as construed by the Supreme Court. Given that, no matter how much we are disgusted by anti-Semitism, we do notand cannotimpinge on free speech, even the most offensive by the most odious of speakers. When dealing with things that involve or implicate speech, the Department is limited to prosecuting crimes that fall under recognized categories of unprotected speech, or otherwise satisfy the First Amendment's exacting standards.
The Department can and does prosecute what the Supreme Court has called ""true threats,"" that is, ""a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals."" Where anti-Semitic tirades constitute true threats, federal prosecution can both punish and deter such conduct.
For example, in March of this year federal agents arrested a self-proclaimed white nationalist in Washington state who allegedly posted anti-Semitic rants about the victim online, including threats to kill the victim and others. That individual was charged with making interstate threats and cyberstalking. The case is scheduled for trial later this year.
The First Amendment also offers no protection for speech that is integral to criminal conduct. In the context of anti-Semitism on the Internet, this means that the Department will not hesitate to prosecute those who cyberstalk, extort, cyberhack, defraud, or otherwise commit crimes in the course of their hateful screeds.
Sometimes it can be difficult to parse whether an incident of anti-Semitism rises to the level of a federal crime. For example, is zoombombing a federal crime? It depends. Although zoombombing is generally disruptive and unwelcome, whether the conduct rises to the level of criminal behavior will turn on very specific facts. Investigators must consider whether a true threat was made, whether there was criminal harassment or stalking, whether there was intentional unauthorized access to, or damage to, a computer, or if another criminal statute was violated.
Not all anti-Semitism will meet the standard of a federal crime. But, make no mistake, the Department of Justice and the Administration as a whole have unequivocally condemned hateful attacks against Jews. And we have prosecuted them when they involved violations of federal criminal laws, including hate crimes and true threats of violence, among others.
I'd like to suggest, however, that at least in the realm of the law, we should look to find a better term than ""hate speech"", as that term can cover some things that are protected by the First Amendment and some that are not, so it has not proven very useful. And sometimes the term ""hate speech"" has been used to label whatever the person using the phrase doesn't like. It has become too easy to label political speech as such. The vagueness and malleability of what counts as ""hate"" could wrongly be deployed to shut down constitutionally protected speech. I have seen some harsh criticism of political leaders that did not sound much like love or affection. Likewise, the label might be used against speech that challenges prevailing orthodoxies or politically correct ideas, but is deemed objectionable by someone who does not wish to hear dissent or opposition. We should not want honest debate silenced, or even heated disagreements about public policy, schools, society, or other public issues. Instead, the concern we ought to have is about vile attacks on people based on illegitimate group stereotypes that constitute threats of violence, or generate actual violence, or other unlawful actions.
On the Internet, as elsewhere, threats and violence have no safe haven. But on the Internet, we have to find ways to condemn genuine bigotry and prejudice while still tolerating disagreements about public issues, and recognizing the limits of what the law can do in a free society that values free speech. Those are issues that the Department also has been considering in the context of legislative immunities that exist under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which I have publicly addressed in the past, but I will leave that topic for others today.
Let me wrap up by underscoring again that, consistent with the founding principles and best traditions of our country, the United States Department of Justice stands firmly and unequivocally against anti-Semitism. We will not hesitate to take action where anti-Semitic conduct rises to the level of a federal crime. That is as true online as it is offline. We have no tolerance for that behavior and will continue to prosecute such conduct as appropriate. Most importantly, we will continue to uphold the rule of law for all Americans.
Thank you again for inviting me to participate in today's important conference."

the only black driver, full-time, with NASCAR - a predominantly white sport. But it's the last few weeks that really have attracted a lot of attention to him, perhaps by people who don't follow the sport, because of his involvement with those protests. And also as one of the key campaigners to have the Confederate flag banned from NASCAR. And there was some reluctance from the sport to do that initially, but he was, and others, were eventually successful in achieving that. 
And it wasn't necessarily a popular decision with every follower of the sport. So this past weekend, the race that he was taking part in was postponed for a day because of the weather, so the track was quite quiet. But this was when the noose was found in the garage for his team. It's been widely condemned and certainly his fellow drivers have rallied around, today - Monday - when the race eventually took place. Some quite emotional scenes as some of the drivers were pushing his car towards the front of the grid. And he was - seemed to be in tears at one point because of the support that he's received.

Jonathan Greenblatt is the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, one of the civil rights groups behind the Stop Hate for Profit campaign. Good to talk to you. Thank you for your time. You have known a lot of campaign groups, a lot of businesses rely on Facebook to maintain their profile. Do you think they really will want to sustain a boycott for very long? Well, look, I think there are a couple of things to point out. First, this is one of the oldest civil rights organisations in the US, and this has been codeveloped by the ADL, the NAACP, and a range of civil rights groups. Number two, we have come together not for a boycott on Facebook, but rather, we call for a pause on advertising for the month of July. And why I am so encouraged is that we have had tremendous positive feedback from companies who agree that if Facebook does not stand up for racial justice, if Facebook allows H to proliferate on the platform, those not they want their brands associated with any more. -- hate. You do hear people say that if Twitter can at least make some moves against misinformation, why can't Facebook? But then, so much of hate speech and fake information on Facebook happens in closed groups. That is almost impossible to police,"

Rosen at U.S Department of State Conference on “Ancient Hatred, Modern Medium: A Conference on Internet Anti-Semitism”",FALSE,"Washington: U.S Department of Justice has issued the following news release:
I want to first thank Secretary Pompeo and Special Envoy Carr for hosting this conference and for inviting me to participate.
As we have heard, the Internet is just the latest outlet for the “oldest hatred.” The litany of attacks on the Jewish people has gone on through every era of history. We should not be surprised then--even though it saddens us--that it is part of our modern world. And, since that world depends on the Internet for communication, commerce, and daily life, anti-Semites can use it for their purposes as much as anyone else can use it for legitimate causes.
Given this history and the reality of our dependence on technology, perhaps we will find ourselves unable to permanently sever the connection between anti-Semitism and the Internet. But as Rabbi Tarfon says in the Mishnah’s Ethics of the Fathers, “It is not incumbent on you to complete the work, but neither can you desist from doing it.”
So they key thing I want to make clear today is that the Department of Justice will not tolerate anti-Semitic acts that violate federal law, whether they occur on the Internet or elsewhere.
As the title for today’s conference suggests, we face an unfortunate and uncomfortable truth: anti-Semitism remains a serious problem, and one that seems to have worsened over the last decade in terms of violent incidents. For example, in April of this year, the Department of Justice announced an arrest and charges for attempted arson at a Jewish assisted living facility in Massachusetts.
It is also disturbing that anti-Semitism seems increasingly prevalent in public discourse. Sometimes it comes from the usual suspects, like neo-Nazis, followers of Louis Farrakhan, or BDS activists, but other times we are startled to see it from more respected sources. Consider when an NFL star like DeSean Jackson tweeted a fake Hitler quote about Jews controlling America, and was endorsed and defended by former NBA player Stephen Jackson. Or when someone who claimed to be a civil rights advocate, like Rodney Muhammad, posted an anti-Semitic cartoon on his public Facebook page.
Now, let me also add that not every reference to Jewish people is anti-Semitic; for example, I reject the assertion that every criticism of political activities funded by George Soros is anti-Semitic. In addition, there are times that bigoted statements are animated by ignorance, rather than malice, and are followed by a willingness to stand corrected and to learn, as appears to be the case in one or two recent incidents.
But the problems on the Internet go beyond abhorrent expressions. The outbreak of “zoombombing” is another illustration. Zoombombing occurs when someone uninvited interrupts and disrupts a videoconference. Some zoombombing may be relatively harmless, such as when a co-worker’s child makes a guest appearance. Other instances, however, are far more troubling. Zoombombers have targeted hateful or threatening messages at synagogue services, scripture classes, school board meetings in areas with large Jewish populations, and a rally for a Jewish candidate running for Lieutenant Governor of Vermont.
All anti-Semitic incidents are offensive and unacceptable, but not all rise to the level of federal crimes. Some do. Those include violence, plots to commit violence, and other crimes against synagogues and religious property. Let me mention two real cases that involve use of the internet:
One involved an online chat group, where just in the last month, a member of a white supremacist group called Atomwaffen pled guilty to federal charges for conspiring and making threats of violence targeted at black and Jewish journalists, as well as members of the Anti-Defamation League.
In another, last November a man was charged with a federal hate crime for threating to blow up a synagogue in Pueblo, Colorado. He allegedly organized much of his plot online, and repeatedly expressed his hatred of Jewish people and his desire to destroy the synagogue.
Addressing this disturbing rise of anti-Semitism is a priority of the Justice Department. Let me briefly mention a few steps we have taken.
First, the Department has been listening to, and learning from, the Jewish community. Last summer, the Attorney General convened the first-ever DOJ Summit on Combating Anti-Semitism, which brought together 150 community leaders and allies. This year the Attorney General also travelled to Brooklyn to meet with a group of Jewish leaders to hear their concerns about a wave of anti-Semitic attacks in New York City.
Second, we want Jewish communities to know where to report potential crimes. Earlier this year, the Attorney General directed U.S Attorneys to reach out to Jewish leaders in their districts, to assure them of support and to provide them with personal contacts for reporting anti-Semitic hate crimes.
Third, and most importantly, we have prioritized investigating and prosecuting anti-Semitic crimes. Faith-based communities have been targeted in their places of worship, their grocery stores, and their community centers. One report cited 234 incidents targeting synagogues and community centers in 2019.
By now, some of the worst cases have become well-known: the Pittsburgh Tree of Life murder of 11 worshipers, the Chabad of Poway California synagogue shootings that killed one and injured 53 others, and the Jersey City murders where two individuals, after killing a police detective, drove to a kosher grocery store and murdered the owner, a worker, and a customer before being killed in a shootout with the police.
As these and other cases demonstrate, the Department of Justice has not hesitated to bring hate crime charges and other federal charges in response to anti-Semitic crimes. Since January 2017, the Department has charged over 80 defendants with federal hate crimes and related conduct. In the same time frame, the Department of Justice has obtained convictions of over 65 defendants for the same.
So this brings me back to the topic of the Internet, and what role the Justice Department can play beyond the deadly cases I have already mentioned. And when the issue is solely one of what things people say, we have to acknowledge the need for more education and changing hearts and minds.
The reason is that the Department vigorously enforces and protects the Constitutional rights of all our citizens, so our efforts must remain consistent with the First Amendment and its guarantees of free expression, as construed by the Supreme Court. Given that, no matter how much we are disgusted by anti-Semitism, we do not—and cannot—impinge on free speech, even the most offensive by the most odious of speakers. When dealing with things that involve or implicate speech, the Department is limited to prosecuting crimes that fall under recognized categories of unprotected speech, or otherwise satisfy the First Amendment’s exacting standards.
The Department can and does prosecute what the Supreme Court has called “true threats,” that is, “a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals.” Where anti-Semitic tirades constitute true threats, federal prosecution can both punish and deter such conduct.
For example, in March of this year federal agents arrested a self-proclaimed white nationalist in Washington state who allegedly posted anti-Semitic rants about the victim online, including threats to kill the victim and others. That individual was charged with making interstate threats and cyberstalking. The case is scheduled for trial later this year.
The First Amendment also offers no protection for speech that is integral to criminal conduct. In the context of anti-Semitism on the Internet, this means that the Department will not hesitate to prosecute those who cyberstalk, extort, cyberhack, defraud, or otherwise commit crimes in the course of their hateful screeds.
Sometimes it can be difficult to parse whether an incident of anti-Semitism rises to the level of a federal crime. For example, is zoombombing a federal crime? It depends. Although zoombombing is generally disruptive and unwelcome, whether the conduct rises to the level of criminal behavior will turn on very specific facts. Investigators must consider whether a true threat was made, whether there was criminal harassment or stalking, whether there was intentional unauthorized access to, or damage to, a computer, or if another criminal statute was violated.
Not all anti-Semitism will meet the standard of a federal crime. But, make no mistake, the Department of Justice and the Administration as a whole have unequivocally condemned hateful attacks against Jews. And we have prosecuted them when they involved violations of federal criminal laws, including hate crimes and true threats of violence, among others.
I’d like to suggest, however, that at least in the realm of the law, we should look to find a better term than “hate speech”, as that term can cover some things that are protected by the First Amendment and some that are not, so it has not proven very useful. And sometimes the term “hate speech” has been used to label whatever the person using the phrase doesn’t like. It has become too easy to label political speech as such. The vagueness and malleability of what counts as “hate” could wrongly be deployed to shut down constitutionally protected speech. I have seen some harsh criticism of political leaders that did not sound much like love or affection. Likewise, the label might be used against speech that challenges prevailing orthodoxies or politically correct ideas, but is deemed objectionable by someone who does not wish to hear dissent or opposition. We should not want honest debate silenced, or even heated disagreements about public policy, schools, society, or other public issues. Instead, the concern we ought to have is about vile attacks on people based on illegitimate group stereotypes that constitute threats of violence, or generate actual violence, or other unlawful actions.
On the Internet, as elsewhere, threats and violence have no safe haven. But on the Internet, we have to find ways to condemn genuine bigotry and prejudice while still tolerating disagreements about public issues, and recognizing the limits of what the law can do in a free society that values free speech. Those are issues that the Department also has been considering in the context of legislative immunities that exist under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which I have publicly addressed in the past, but I will leave that topic for others today.
Let me wrap up by underscoring again that, consistent with the founding principles and best traditions of our country, the United States Department of Justice stands firmly and unequivocally against anti-Semitism. We will not hesitate to take action where anti-Semitic conduct rises to the level of a federal crime. That is as true online as it is offline. We have no tolerance for that behavior and will continue to prosecute such conduct as appropriate. Most importantly, we will continue to uphold the rule of law for all Americans.
Thank you again for inviting me to participate in today’s important conference."

Since then Zadie Smith (London, 1975) is regarded as one of the brightest British writers, with a work in which she alternates novels and essays. 
Confinement caught him in New York, where he has been teaching creative writing for years. His new book is the result of those days when the United States was shaken by the pandemic, as well as protests over the murder of George Floyd. It is titled Contemplations (Salamandra) and consists of six short but precious essays in which he reflects on america, the writing craft, the role of artists, President Donald Trump and the other virus that travels the world:contempt. 
He says writing is a way to keep what's going on under control. Did it work for you during confinement? Definitely writing helped me organize my days and weather over time. During the confinement there was the compulsion to do something, whatever. Doesn't writing really seem very different to gardening, breads and biscuits or sewing? He even claims that these activities can be more creative. I don't really see much difference between those activities and writing. I've lived quite a bit in America, where they place a lot of emphasis on writing and creativity as magical forces. And, at the same time, they are very derogatory with tasks that I find very creative, such as domestic, craftsmanship... For me it's all based on the same impulse: to shape something that didn't have it. I don't make great distinctions, anyone who does something for me belongs to the community of those who do. Defines write as a form of resistance. Against what? Resistance against meaninglessness; writing is a way of insisting on giving meaning to things. The world is a place without much sense, it's there and we're the ones trying to make sense of it. Writing is a way of resistance against that senselessness, and so it is everything. In his book he stresses that coronavirus is not at all a democratic virus... It is not a very original statement, at this point it is perfectly clear that it is not democratic. But the distinction made by this virus is not so much racial as it is economic. It distinguishes between people who can stay at home and those who can't, distinguishes between different types of work... can this pandemic make Americans aware of the huge social differences that still exist in that country? You're wrong to think you don't see those differences, of course you see them, you see them every day. Anyone living in America is perfectly aware of these huge differences, it is not a problem of lack of conscience. In fact, in 'Contemplations' he argues that in most schools in New York there is still racial segregation... It's just like that: the de-segregation of schools has never happened. Foreigners sometimes have a distorted image of America, but Americans know very well what their schools are like, what their neighborhoods are like. It warns against a new epidemic: contempt, racism. Are there many white Americans infected with that virus? I would not express it in these fatalistic or existential terms, especially since there are also many white Americans in America who suffer total contempt: poor whites. Contempt is not a mysterious racial disease, it is a social disease that has different ways of expressing themselves, and one of them is racial. There was a huge contempt when a cop immobilized George Floyd on the ground and nailed his knee to his neck to death by suffocation, didn't there? Yes. But it's about somethingin the United States, police murder poor people, both black and white, quite regularly. It's about money and power, about people deprived of their citizens' rights. Of course in America there are a lot of black people deprived of their rights, but they're not the only ones. Have the protests following Floyd's death been aggravated by the desperation this pandemic has brought to many of the poorest communities? I wasn't there during the protests, but I've seen that most of those protesting were young and that they were completely interracial protests. I believe that this generation of activists has understood that this is not a matter of a community, but an issue that affects the whole of america and that it has to do with the power of the police, its militarization for 25 years and contempt for its citizens. Maybe those protests are the vaccine against the contempt virus? It's not about making metaphors. The only thing that can change things is a change in legislation, and to have that change of legislation you have to vote for a party that commits to passing such laws. The language of poetry does not work when it comes to dealing with systemic changes. It is no mystery: you can vote for different types of police power, you can invest more in social services, you can do many things. But first of all, we need to change the government. And that's not too complicated: if the same people who have come out to protest are going to vote, there may be. But in his book he stresses that contempt is not a matter of Democrats or Republicans, that in both parties there are those who are in a more disadvantaged situation... I think it is a mistake to think of these matters from a personal point of view, as if they were sins, as if being anti-racist meant that you have attained the purity of the soul. I'm not interested in people's individual morals, the least. What interests me is that there are structures that allow people to behave less badly than they do. What they secretly feel inside their hearts seems irrelevant to me. But if there were schools in which the children of the two communities studied together, we would have an equitable structure. If there was a health system that served the two communities equally, it would be important. He says he doesn't like the term hate crimes. In the end everything recreates the hierarchies. If you asked me, for example, what I think of cultural appropriation, what I would be saying is that I am always in the position of those who steal things from them, while white people are not robbed,that I cannot appropriate anything from white people, which is impossible. These conversations, even if they are well-inted, always create the same hierarchies over and over again. Something similar happens with the term hate crime: I don't like the idea that only a few people in particular can be hateful and others are impervious to hatred and therefore can only be active subjects to those crimes. That constantly states that I am not in the center, but on the sidelines. And I don't see myself like that. "

BROOKE BALDWIN, CNN HOST: That little one is Elvis, the couple's son, who was born just last year. Nick Cordero was 41.
""THE LEAD"" starts right now.
ANNOUNCER: This is CNN breaking news.
PAMELA BROWN, CNN HOST: And welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Pamela Brown, in for Jake Tapper.
And we begin with our health lead: the coronavirus pandemic.
This afternoon, the White House press secretary shockingly claimed that the world is looking at the United States as a -- quote -- ""leader"" in combating coronavirus.
Yet the nation is only leading in all the wrong ways, the number of coronavirus cases now almost three million, and deaths now more than 130,000. Only four states are seeing the number of coronavirus cases decrease. And California and Florida, well, they're leading the way in the number of new infections.
And we are already in the midst of a surge, but health experts fear another across the nation linked to crowded holiday gatherings. Plus, more than 200 scientists around the world now outlining evidence that coronavirus can float in air droplets, lingering indoors, even after an infectious person has left.
And, as CNN's Jason Carroll reports, at least 10 states are experiencing record levels of coronavirus hospitalizations.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
JASON CARROLL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): What pandemic?
GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): We get complacent. We get cocky. We get a little arrogant. That is a real threat.
CARROLL: Across the country, July 4 gatherings with no social distancing or mask wearing, like this party in Diamond Lake, Michigan, at a water park in Wisconsin, this speedway outside Denver, and on Fire Island, New York, where crowds gathered on the beach during the day and at a pool party at night.
CUOMO: I don't know how else to say it. Actions have come consequences.
CARROLL: In all, coronavirus cases surging in 32 states, California reaching new dangerous levels Sunday, with nearly 12,000 new cases reported. Texas saw its second highest day of new cases over the weekend.
The mayor of Austin says his city is two weeks away from running out of hospital beds.
STEVE ADLER (D), MAYOR OF AUSTIN, TX: We opened up in ways that were not sustainable. And now we're having to turn that curve.
CARROLL: In Florida, where they shut many beaches to discourage holiday crowds, a record for the most coronavirus cases in the United States in a single day on Saturday, and more troubling numbers.
In Miami-Dade County, the state's hardest-hit, the positivity rate is at 26 percent. The goal is 10 or lower, hospitalizations up 88 percent, ventilator use up 119 percent. The mayor there today signing an emergency order rolling back reopening, closing restaurants for indoor dining and other businesses starting Wednesday.
DAN GELBER (D), MAYOR OF MIAMI BEACH, FL: We're starting to roll the carpet back up. It's pretty clear we have this real problem.
CARROLL: Health experts warned for months that more attention needs to be paid to how the virus transmits in the air. Now 239 scientists have signed a letter addressed to the World Health Organization asking them to be more up front in explaining that. Currently, the organization does not call COVID-19 an airborne virus.
DR. ASHISH JHA, DIRECTOR, HARVARD GLOBAL HEALTH INSTITUTE: The bottom line is very, very clear. Yes, there is aerosolized transmission. And people absolutely need to be wearing masks, and they need to be wearing masks particularly when they're indoors.
CARROLL: And now some potentially encouraging news on the treatment front. The biotechnology company Regeneron announced today it is in phase three of clinical trials on a drug to prevent and treat coronavirus.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
CARROLL: And, Pamela, this late development.
Hospitals in at least two Florida counties now so they are at capacity. We're talking about Pinellas County. We're also talking about Clay County, the Kindred Hospital there in North Florida, basically now saying they have zero out of 40 beds available -- Pamela.
BROWN: Jason Carroll, thank you for bringing us the latest. And now let's talk to one of these doctors who's on the front lines, Dr. Craig Spencer, director of global health and emergency medicine at New York Presbyterian Columbia University Medical Center in New York City.
In fact, you're just recovering from an overnight shift in the E.R., Dr. Spencer. You have been treating coronavirus patients since the start of this pandemic. You just finished that shift. The White House says, as you heard today, that the U.S. is the leader of the world when it comes to handling coronavirus. Is that wishful thinking?
DR. CRAIG SPENCER, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER: Absolutely.
Let me be clear and start by saying that what we're seeing now is an abject failure in our pandemic response here in the United States. I want to also be clear that this is not a political statement. This is a public health proclamation.
What we need to do right now to address this is to focus on the future. We need to do the same thing that I have been talking about for months and many other public health professionals have been saying since really the start of this outbreak.
[16:05:06]
We need way more testing. We don't need to undermine the value of testing. We need to build a contact tracing corps. We need to make sure our front-line providers have personal protective equipment. Many are still going to work without the stuff that they absolutely need all around this country.
And the most important thing we need to do right now is, we need to put public health, public health professionals, and public health agencies, at the forefront. We can't be hearing public health information from the president on his Twitter feed, if we hope to get through this pandemic.
BROWN: And I want to get your reaction to these pictures, Dr. Spencer, people hitting beaches across New York. How concerned are you that New Yorkers might believe they are in the clear, which could once again lead to packed emergency rooms and hospitals incredibly, incredibly overextended?
SPENCER: You know, I am really worried.
What we went through here in New York City and what we saw on a daily basis in the emergency department was horrible. I understand that people want to get out and they want to get to some sense of normalcy. I'm, quite frankly, less worried about people being on beaches as long as they're far from each other.
We know that being outdoors helps reduce the transmission. But being close is certainly no good. I'm more concerned, quite frankly, about people in other places where the number of cases are surging. Right now in New York City, the test positivity is between 1 and 2 percent, meaning that there's not much virus floating around. There's not much virus here in New York City, in contrast to places like Arizona, Florida, Texas, where the percent positivity for those tests is 10, 15, 25 percent in places like Arizona. That's where I'm more concerned about people being outside, being inside, really just allowing this virus to spread.
That is what's more concerning to me.
BROWN: And you have said that, essentially, there has been abject failure, from what you're seeing, in terms of leadership on coronavirus.
And yet you have the White House today defending the president saying that 99 percent of coronavirus cases are totally harmless, saying that it just has to do with how you look at the numbers, looking at the mortality rate.
What are the facts here?
SPENCER: Well, that's not true, as someone who took care of hundreds of COVID patients and saw many of them die and held their hands as they did, and saw their families sobbing on FaceTime, as they saw their family members fall prey to this illness.
Look, even if you look at the really, quite honestly, bad statistics we have in the U.S. -- we know that we have undertested for a long time -- if you look at the 11 million cases, over 11 million cases we have here, and 130,000 deaths, that's 4.5 percent mortality.
We know that's not necessarily the true mortality rate. But 99 percent doesn't even jibe with the bad numbers that the president is so proud about; 99 percent doesn't make any sense. No public health professional...
(CROSSTALK)
BROWN: But even if you don't die from coronavirus, does that make it not harmless, from what you have seen?
SPENCER: Absolutely not.
I see so many people who have chronic or longer-term complications. It's not just a flu, where you get over it and you feel better a couple days later with some chicken soup, some Tylenol.
I am seeing people who are having complications one, two months after this. I have seen people in the emergency room in the past 24 hours that have blood clots that have been associated with this. We know people that have had strokes and will have chronic disability from this.
Look, it's very clear that death is not the only thing that we should be thinking about with this. Many people are going to have long-term symptoms. And as someone who survived Ebola, a viral disease as well that many people have had and continue to have these long-term consequences, there's a lot more that we're going to learn about this. It's not just death. We need to think about the other chronic conditions that are going to come from coronavirus infection.
BROWN: And let's take a listen to FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, when he was asked by my colleague Dana Bash about the president's false claim.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DR. STEPHEN HAHN, COMMISSIONER, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION: I'm not going to get into who is right and who is wrong.
What I have going to say, Dana, is what I have said before, which is that it's a serious problem that we have. We have seen the surge in cases. We must do something to stem the tide.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BROWN: Does that damage the trustworthiness of the nation's public health officials when you hear that?
SPENCER: Absolutely.
Look, the biggest problem we have had all throughout this outbreak is that we have not had public health professionals at the forefront. We're hearing from an FDA commissioner. We also heard from the White House chief of staff, who was commenting on the same thing, and saying that this only affects people with comorbidities, not recognizing that the majority of American adults have some comorbidities, like high blood pressure, diabetes.
They don't know the nuance of this disease. They have never treated a patient with this disease. They should not be talking about the public health or really the health complications of this disease. They should be focusing on the policy. And that policy should be guided by public health professionals only.
BROWN: All right, Dr. Craig Spencer, thank you so much.
SPENCER: Thanks for having me.
BROWN: And up next: President Trump stoking division, and his press secretary unable to explain it, as the president of the United States embraces the Confederate Flag, all to benefit himself.
Then, 8 years old, 7 years old, 11 years old, 8 years old, these are the ages of just some of the children shot and killed in a weekend of violence.
[16:14:22]
BROWN: In our politics lead: As the nation faces a reckoning on race, the White House press secretary could not defend the latest divisive rhetoric from President Trump today, unable to say whether the president of the United States disavows the Confederate Flag and refusing to explain the president's tweet today that NASCAR's decision to ban the Confederate Flag has caused -- quote -- ""the lowest ratings ever.""
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
QUESTION: What is the president's position? Does he think NASCAR made a mistake by banning the Confederate Flag?
KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: So, he said he -- I spoke to him this morning about this. And he said he was not making a judgment one way or the other.
QUESTION: Let's drill down on the Confederate Flag. Does he think it was a mistake for NASCAR to ban it?
MCENANY: The president said he wasn't making a judgment one way or the other.
[16:15:02]
QUESTION: Why would the president not praise NASCAR for removing the Confederate flag, particularly given the history of that flag, the symbol that it has for African-Americans?
MCENANY: What we're seeing across the nation is this vast cancel culture where we're going to tear down our monuments, we are going to tear down Gandhi, we are going to tear down George Washington, we're going to tear down Lincoln. And it's really quite appalling what we've seen happen across the country. And the president wants no part in cancel culture.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PAMELA BROWN, CNN HOST: And soon after the press secretary's briefing, the president also complaining that the Washington Redskins and Cleveland Indians are considering changing their team names to, quote, be politically correct.
Now, this is the latest episode of President Trump pitting Americans against one another, defending statues of controversial figures, refusing to consider renaming army bases named for Confederate leaders, calling Black Lives Matter a symbol of hate, and, of course, having said there were good people on both sides of the violence in Charlottesville in 2017.
All of this an apparent distraction tactic as the coronavirus pandemic is raging in the United States with more than 130,000 people in this country dead from that virus.
As CNN's Jeremy Diamond reports, the tweets today follow a series of inflammatory statements for the president during the weekend celebrating American independence.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Today, President Trump ramping up his divisive and racially charged rhetoric. The president suggesting he disagrees with NASCAR's decision to ban the Confederate flag at its races and falsely accusing NASCAR's only black driver of orchestrating a hoax after a member of his team found a noose in his garage.
QUESTION: Why is the president even suggesting that Mr. Wallace should apologize?
MCENANY: Well, look, the FBI, as I noted, concluded that this was not a hate crime. And he believes it will go a long way if Bubba came out and acknowledged that as well.
DIAMOND: But Wallace did back on June 24th, saying he was relieved after the FBI determined the noose had been in the garage since last year. This afternoon, Wallace tweeted: Always deal with the hate being thrown at you with love, adding, even when it's hate from the president.
The White House press secretary also trying to claim that Trump was not expressing support for the Confederate flag.
MCENANY: I spoke to him this morning about this and he said he was not making a judgment one way or the other.
DIAMOND: South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a loyal Trump supporter, backing NASCAR's decision.
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): They are trying to grow the sport. The Confederate flag is not a good way to grow your business.
DIAMOND: And defending Wallace.
GRAHAM: Well, I don't think Bubba Wallace has anything to apologize for.
DIAMOND: Trump's tweet builds on the inflammatory rhetoric he delivered in a pair of Independence Day speeches, in which he painted racial injustice protesters as fascists trying to end America as we know it.
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Angry mobs are trying to tear down statues of our founders, deface our most sacred memorials, and unleash a wave of violent crime in our cities.
We will never allow an angry mob to tear down our statues, erase our history, indoctrinate our children, or trample on our freedoms.
DIAMOND: After trying to recast his fight to protect Confederate monuments as an attempt to --
TRUMP: Protect and preserve our history, our heritage, and our great heroes.
DIAMOND: The president's race-based appeals unmasked by his own tweets, signaling a campaign strategy to stoke fear among white Americans, just like in 2016.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
DIAMOND: And, Pam, as you see the president and the White House's rhetoric on these issues of race and on this issue of the Confederate flag, in particular, we are now learning from a defense official who tells our colleague Barbara Starr that top military brass are reviewing a draft policy proposal that would ban all Confederate flags from military bases across the armed services. That would put on hold efforts by different branches of the military service currently underway to consider potential bans.
But, Pam, as you can see based on the rhetoric from the White House press secretary from the president himself, this could certainly set up a clash between the president and top military brass over this issue of the Confederate flag -- Pam.
BROWN: You're absolutely right about that. Thanks so much, Jeremy Diamond.
And I want to bring in CNN political correspondent, Abby Phillip, ""Washington Post"" reporter Toluse Olorunnipa, and ""Vox"" senior politics reporter, Jane Coaston.
My apologies to Toluse.
And, Toluse, I'm going to start with you because the White House says Trump doesn't doesn't have a stance one way or the other on the Confederate flag front. Why is it so hard for the president, for this White House to come out against a flag that's a symbol of racism?
TOLUSE OLORUNNIPA, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Yeah, obviously, by saying the president doesn't have a stance, they are taking a stance.
[16:20:02]
This is a president that has an opinion on everything from the Oscars to the weekend lineup at Fox News. He has an opinion on basically everything that you can think of and he tweets it out, he's not shy about his opinions, the fact that they are trying to essentially play both sides by saying the president doesn't have a view, doesn't have an opinion, is very clear that in 2020 if you don't have a view about the Confederate flag, that speaks volumes and it tells exactly where you stand. We've seen the president call the Black Lives Matter movement a symbol of hate. But when it comes to the Confederate flag, he has no view, no thoughts about what exactly it means. And, obviously, we see from his tweet where he said that it was a mistake essentially for NASCAR to ban the Confederate flag.
He does a view. He does believe that NASCAR made the wrong decision by banning this flag and that he would be fine having the Confederate flag flying all over the country in 2020. It's very clear he has a view. The White House may not have wanted to sort of publicize that view.
But in 2020, if you're saying you don't have a view about the Confederate flag, it's pretty clear where you stand.
BROWN: And yet, he's made that view clear not just recently but historically. And what struck out to me was the White House press secretary also said this repeatedly. Take a listen.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MCENANY: As happened with Jussie Smollett, as happened with the Covington Catholic boys in an aggregate, those actions made it seem like NASCAR men and women were racist individuals who were roving around and engaging in a hate crime.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BROWN: All right. So, Abby, those incidents she mentioned, they are all totally different. But let's talk about remarks taken in aggregate here, OK?
You have the president's Confederate flag tweet today. He said he will veto any bill to change the name of military bases named after Confederate generals. The president has said there are good people on both sides in the Charlottesville violence.
He's attacked NFL players for kneeling during the national anthem. He called himself a nationalist. He said, quote, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. And he shared a tweet and then it was deleted where a person said ""white power.""
So, when you look at that in aggregate, what does that tell you, Abby?
ABBY PHILLIP, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, you can just take the president's statements and actions over the last week and you would have an aggregate view of a president who's running for re-election on white grievance, as a central unifying message for his campaign. This is not an isolated incident, and it's also not about, you know, false claims of hate crimes that are not real, as the press secretary wanted it to be about.
What this really is, is about how the president leads. Does he unite the country or does he divide the country? Does he stand up for anti- racism or does he defend symbols of racism? And I think time and time again, the president has defended the symbols of racism, threatening that he would veto a bill that sought to remove Confederate names from U.S. military bases because that is a priority for him.
He has rarely voiced the concerns or the feelings of, you know, millions of black Americans who do not view Confederate symbols as their history. And so that is the aggregate, as you say, Pam. That's the aggregate view I think of what the president's been doing over the last several weeks but really over the last many, many years dating all the way back to, as Jeremy said in his piece, back to 2016 when, at that time, it was Mexicans being criminals and rapists and banning Muslims.
Today, it's Americans being pitted against Americans in an effort to further divide the country, it seems. BROWN: That's a very important point there. And you make also another point, Abby, when he kept saying and the White House press secretary kept saying ""our history.""
But, Jane, what do you really hear? Are they really talking about everyone's history here in America?
JANE COASTON, SENIOR POLITICS REPORTER, VOX: I don't think so. The Confederacy was canceled in 1865 by the deaths of hundreds of thousands of American citizens who stood up to reunite this did country and the institution of slavery. But it's a fascinating rhetorical tactic because it's one that's reliant on not just racial grievance but online racial grievance. If you're not on Twitter and you're not following the news super closely, what you're concerned about are small businesses shutting down because of coronavirus. What you're concerned about is the pandemic that continues to kill across the country.
And you go online and you find out that the president is more focused about yelling about football teams than he is on what working-class Americans, many of whom voted for him in 2016 believing that he would listen to them when others hadn't. And he is really worried about a NASCAR driver and a football team and kind of the -- it's an extraordinarily online campaign that is supposed to reach out to people who aren't online.
[16:25:01]
And so I think it's a base attention tactic. But it shows no promise of either widening Trump's base, getting independent voters, or more importantly speaking to what Americans are worried about.
BROWN: OK. Well, Jane, we're going to work on your audio over the break.
And be sure to stick around because there's a lot more to discuss that, you know, President Trump may be using racism to appeal to his base. But are some of his critics playing into his hands?
We're going to discuss that right after this break. Stay with us.

Rosen at U.S. Department of State Conference on Ancient Hatred, Modern Medium: A Conference on Internet Anti-Semitism",FALSE,"I want to first thank Secretary Pompeo and Special Envoy Carr for hosting this conference and for inviting me to participate.
As we have heard, the Internet is just the latest outlet for the oldest hatred. The litany of attacks on the Jewish people has gone on through every era of history. We should not be surprised then--even though it saddens us--that it is part of our modern world. And, since that world depends on the Internet for communication, commerce, and daily life, anti-Semites can use it for their purposes as much as anyone else can use it for legitimate causes.
Given this history and the reality of our dependence on technology, perhaps we will find ourselves unable to permanently sever the connection between anti-Semitism and the Internet. But as Rabbi Tarfon says in the Mishnah's Ethics of the Fathers, It is not incumbent on you to complete the work, but neither can you desist from doing it.
So they key thing I want to make clear today is that the Department of Justice will not tolerate anti-Semitic acts that violate federal law, whether they occur on the Internet or elsewhere.
As the title for today's conference suggests, we face an unfortunate and uncomfortable truth: anti-Semitism remains a serious problem, and one that seems to have worsened over the last decade in terms of violent incidents. For example, in April of this year, the Department of Justice announced an arrest and charges for attempted arson at a Jewish assisted living facility in Massachusetts.
It is also disturbing that anti-Semitism seems increasingly prevalent in public discourse. Sometimes it comes from the usual suspects, like neo-Nazis, followers of Louis Farrakhan, or BDS activists, but other times we are startled to see it from more respected sources. Consider when an NFL star like DeSean Jackson tweeted a fake Hitler quote about Jews controlling America, and was endorsed and defended by former NBA player Stephen Jackson. Or when someone who claimed to be a civil rights advocate, like Rodney Muhammad, posted an anti-Semitic cartoon on his public Facebook page.
Now, let me also add that not every reference to Jewish people is anti-Semitic; for example, I reject the assertion that every criticism of political activities funded by George Soros is anti-Semitic. In addition, there are times that bigoted statements are animated by ignorance, rather than malice, and are followed by a willingness to stand corrected and to learn, as appears to be the case in one or two recent incidents.
But the problems on the Internet go beyond abhorrent expressions. The outbreak of zoombombing is another illustration. Zoombombing occurs when someone uninvited interrupts and disrupts a videoconference. Some zoombombing may be relatively harmless, such as when a co-worker's child makes a guest appearance. Other instances, however, are far more troubling. Zoombombers have targeted hateful or threatening messages at synagogue services, scripture classes, school board meetings in areas with large Jewish populations, and a rally for a Jewish candidate running for Lieutenant Governor of Vermont.
All anti-Semitic incidents are offensive and unacceptable, but not all rise to the level of federal crimes. Some do. Those include violence, plots to commit violence, and other crimes against synagogues and religious property. Let me mention two real cases that involve use of the internet:
One involved an online chat group, where just in the last month, a member of a white supremacist group called Atomwaffen pled guilty to federal charges for conspiring and making threats of violence targeted at black and Jewish journalists, as well as members of the Anti-Defamation League.
In another, last November a man was charged with a federal hate crime for threating to blow up a synagogue in Pueblo, Colorado. He allegedly organized much of his plot online, and repeatedly expressed his hatred of Jewish people and his desire to destroy the synagogue.
Addressing this disturbing rise of anti-Semitism is a priority of the Justice Department. Let me briefly mention a few steps we have taken.
First, the Department has been listening to, and learning from, the Jewish community. Last summer, the Attorney General convened the first-ever DOJ Summit on Combating Anti-Semitism, which brought together 150 community leaders and allies. This year the Attorney General also travelled to Brooklyn to meet with a group of Jewish leaders to hear their concerns about a wave of anti-Semitic attacks in New York City.
Second, we want Jewish communities to know where to report potential crimes. Earlier this year, the Attorney General directed U.S. Attorneys to reach out to Jewish leaders in their districts, to assure them of support and to provide them with personal contacts for reporting anti-Semitic hate crimes.
Third, and most importantly, we have prioritized investigating and prosecuting anti-Semitic crimes. Faith-based communities have been targeted in their places of worship, their grocery stores, and their community centers. One report cited 234 incidents targeting synagogues and community centers in 2019.
By now, some of the worst cases have become well-known: the Pittsburgh Tree of Life murder of 11 worshipers, the Chabad of Poway California synagogue shootings that killed one and injured 53 others, and the Jersey City murders where two individuals, after killing a police detective, drove to a kosher grocery store and murdered the owner, a worker, and a customer before being killed in a shootout with the police.
As these and other cases demonstrate, the Department of Justice has not hesitated to bring hate crime charges and other federal charges in response to anti-Semitic crimes. Since January 2017, the Department has charged over 80 defendants with federal hate crimes and related conduct. In the same time frame, the Department of Justice has obtained convictions of over 65 defendants for the same.
So this brings me back to the topic of the Internet, and what role the Justice Department can play beyond the deadly cases I have already mentioned. And when the issue is solely one of what things people say, we have to acknowledge the need for more education and changing hearts and minds.
The reason is that the Department vigorously enforces and protects the Constitutional rights of all our citizens, so our efforts must remain consistent with the First Amendment and its guarantees of free expression, as construed by the Supreme Court. Given that, no matter how much we are disgusted by anti-Semitism, we do not-and cannot-impinge on free speech, even the most offensive by the most odious of speakers. When dealing with things that involve or implicate speech, the Department is limited to prosecuting crimes that fall under recognized categories of unprotected speech, or otherwise satisfy the First Amendment's exacting standards.
The Department can and does prosecute what the Supreme Court has called true threats, that is, a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals. Where anti-Semitic tirades constitute true threats, federal prosecution can both punish and deter such conduct.
For example, in March of this year federal agents arrested a self-proclaimed white nationalist in Washington state who allegedly posted anti-Semitic rants about the victim online, including threats to kill the victim and others. That individual was charged with making interstate threats and cyberstalking. The case is scheduled for trial later this year.
The First Amendment also offers no protection for speech that is integral to criminal conduct. In the context of anti-Semitism on the Internet, this means that the Department will not hesitate to prosecute those who cyberstalk, extort, cyberhack, defraud, or otherwise commit crimes in the course of their hateful screeds.
Sometimes it can be difficult to parse whether an incident of anti-Semitism rises to the level of a federal crime. For example, is zoombombing a federal crime? It depends. Although zoombombing is generally disruptive and unwelcome, whether the conduct rises to the level of criminal behavior will turn on very specific facts. Investigators must consider whether a true threat was made, whether there was criminal harassment or stalking, whether there was intentional unauthorized access to, or damage to, a computer, or if another criminal statute was violated.
Not all anti-Semitism will meet the standard of a federal crime. But, make no mistake, the Department of Justice and the Administration as a whole have unequivocally condemned hateful attacks against Jews. And we have prosecuted them when they involved violations of federal criminal laws, including hate crimes and true threats of violence, among others.
I'd like to suggest, however, that at least in the realm of the law, we should look to find a better term than hate speech, as that term can cover some things that are protected by the First Amendment and some that are not, so it has not proven very useful. And sometimes the term hate speech has been used to label whatever the person using the phrase doesn't like. It has become too easy to label political speech as such. The vagueness and malleability of what counts as hate could wrongly be deployed to shut down constitutionally protected speech. I have seen some harsh criticism of political leaders that did not sound much like love or affection. Likewise, the label might be used against speech that challenges prevailing orthodoxies or politically correct ideas, but is deemed objectionable by someone who does not wish to hear dissent or opposition. We should not want honest debate silenced, or even heated disagreements about public policy, schools, society, or other public issues. Instead, the concern we ought to have is about vile attacks on people based on illegitimate group stereotypes that constitute threats of violence, or generate actual violence, or other unlawful actions.
On the Internet, as elsewhere, threats and violence have no safe haven. But on the Internet, we have to find ways to condemn genuine bigotry and prejudice while still tolerating disagreements about public issues, and recognizing the limits of what the law can do in a free society that values free speech. Those are issues that the Department also has been considering in the context of legislative immunities that exist under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which I have publicly addressed in the past, but I will leave that topic for others today.
Let me wrap up by underscoring again that, consistent with the founding principles and best traditions of our country, the United States Department of Justice stands firmly and unequivocally against anti-Semitism. We will not hesitate to take action where anti-Semitic conduct rises to the level of a federal crime. That is as true online as it is offline. We have no tolerance for that behavior and will continue to prosecute such conduct as appropriate. Most importantly, we will continue to uphold the rule of law for all Americans.
Thank you again for inviting me to participate in today's important conference.

Wish you were with us yesterday, get a glimpse of the New LaGuardia Airport which is unbelievable, incredible, people are going to be blown away. It is day 103 in dealing with the COVID crises, day 18 in dealing with the civil unrest after the murder of Mr. Floyd. And this is as tumultuous as we have seen.
You have these two major crises going on at the same time. They actually intersect with the protestors being a mass gathering at the time of COVID. And then you have an overall dynamic, an overall environment, you have terrible political divides, this hyper partisan, nasty political season. There is racial division after the civil unrest and watching the Mr. Floyd murder on television. But what does New York do when the going gets tough? New York gets going. New Yorkis the progressive capital of the United States. You look back at history. You look at when there was a pivot point in society and more often than not New York was the point of pivot. You have a problem. You have an issue. New Yorkwas the one that stepped up to the plate and resolved it, boldly, and the nation followed. And we're doing the same on police reform. The disciplinary record release, more transparency, banning chokeholds, the attorney general as special prosecutor, hate crimes. I applaud the New York State Legislature for moving as quickly as they did.
On reopening, we've been talking about following the metrics, following the science, we've been talking about the hospitalization rate, the intubation rate, the hospital capacity, the ICU capacity, the number of tests, the number of tracers. We've had the most science-based, most informed reopening I think it's fair to say in the country. It is nothing about intuition, nothing about politics, look at the numbers follow the numbers. And we have more numbers, we're doing more testing, we have more reports from the hospitals, so we've been following the data. Now at this point, there's one number to watch closely and that is the daily testing number. Why? The others are status of the system or they'relagging indicators. Hospitalization rate is definitive but the hospitalization rate is probably two weeks lagging behind the infection rate. If you're getting your information from the hospitalization rate, you're closing the barn door after the horse is gone, right? The daily testing, we do about 50,000 tests per day, 50,000 tests per day, just think about that. No other state comes near 50,000 tests per day. We report those numbers the next day. So, every day you have a snapshot of the day before with 50,000 tests all across the state. That's the number that we have to watch.
So, daily test results by region. New York City for example. Monday was one 1.8. Tuesday was 1.5. Yesterday was one 1.7. Watch those daily numbers. There a certain bounce little high, little low. You're not dealing with the largest numbers in some of these locations. But you want to watch, you want to notice any trend line, you want to notice any bounce,and then you want to find out why, okay? So let's say you see region going up. You then look at those people who were tested and see if you can find something out from those people who were tested. This is what the local officials should be doing. This is the testing and then there is tracing, right? So, New York City they do tests, they find 200 people who were positive that day. The tracers then go back and look at those 200 people. What can we learn from those 200 people? Well, of to 200, 25 all work at this one place. Of the 200, ten were at the same party. Of the 200, 13 went to this restaurant. So, you look at those that test positive. But first watch the daily numbers.
You do it by region, and then you can look within the region by county. So New York City that just reopened that will be watching closely, you see the deviation among the counties, but then you watch the trend line. Bronx 2, 3, 2, 1, to 4. Brooklyn 1, 9, 1, 3, 1, 9, Manhattan 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, and again you'll see plus or minus deviations but you want to look for an increase and then a continued increase. Overall, the hospitalizations are still headed down. Overall the number of deaths is close to its lowest point. Also, on the number of deaths when you get this low on the number of deaths, I don't know what it is really telling us anymore. This can be a question of how doctors happen to certify of cause of death. Many of these people have comorbidities, so you could have a heart disease, you could have diabetes, you could have hypertension, you could have a respiratory illness and COVID. What is the cause of death between cancer and COVID, right? But it's overall great news again, and you see the number of lives lost continuing to go down.
We have five regions that we have reviewed all the data, we have global experts who then go through the data, because sometimes if you look at the data you look at the underlying numbers you look at the underlying test you can see something but. We have the best experts that you can possibly have reviewing this. And they've reviewed it and five regions will enter Phase 3 tomorrow, Friday. Phase 3 is clearly indicated on the website what businesses can open, what businesses can't open. Also, a point of caution: I know businesses are anxious to open, everybody's anxious get the economy going. Please follow the guidelines and do what is permissible to do. People are very wary right businesses that are violating the opening rules. Restaurant's outdoor capacity that doesn't mean anyone inside. So, people call and we get complaints. The rules are clear some businesses say when you know my mayors said, this is my Aunt Tilly said this would be ok, my town councilman said this would be ok, and that doesn't count. Follow the rules and you can lose your liquor license you can lose your right to operate. So, this is very serious. Short-term gain isn't worth long-term pain.
As we're entering the summer public pools and playgrounds we're going to leave to open or keep closed in the discretion of local governments. But they have to use their judgment here. Again, they have the test data, they should be studying the test data, they should be looking at those positives and see where the positives are coming from. If the positives are in a cluster, a neighborhood that has that pool, don't open the pool. Well everybody wants to swim, I understand. Everybody doesn't want to see a spike in COVID again. So, use your judgment. Sometimes yes is not the right answer. It's the easy answer.
In this overall situation, I don't have to say it - we need caution. We have to beware, we need warnings, you take your pick. The numbers are good, everything we've done has been exactly right up until now. But that's up until now. And you can make a mistake today that wipes out everything we've done, so we have to stay smart. This COVID has not gone away. Doctor Fauci spoke to it, the CDC speaks to it. We have done extraordinarily well because the people of this state have responded in a way no one predicted, and they'll actually research in talk about for years I believe.
But Covid is still out there. It's increasing in 21 states. 14 states highest number ever of Covid cases. And if you look at what's going on it tends to be after the reopening. Why? Because the reopening is the point that increases the activity. Just look what happened in these other states. California, they reopen and then look at the increase after the reopening. And it's not one state. It is the pattern, my friends. And it is to be expected, because we brought down that number because we closed everything down. You open that value, you increase the activity, you will see it spread. Look at Florida, May 4. Texas, Arizona, it's the same story. We want to reopen. We want to reopen. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. No, it's fine until it's not fine. Kentucky. Look at South Carolina. Look at North Carolina. Look at Missouri. I mean, it is all across the country. Look at Utah. Look at Arkansas. Look at Nevada. It is all across the country.
We are the exception and an outrageous exception. We so far have the exact opposite phenomenon. We reopen the number continues to go down. We reopen the number continues to go down. How can that be? Because our reopening is different than their reopening. Our reopening is based on the numbers. Our reopening is phased. And because New Yorkers have been smart and they've been diligent. And you can say reopen, not reopen. They've been informed in this state. They have been informed. They know what's going on.
I run into people on the street who know things about my briefing that I forgot. Remember you said this. Remember you had this number. No, I don't remember. They remember. They are smart. They're informed. So, they're protecting themselves. And they dismissed the politics. But we are the exception. To date we're the exception. And that can change and that can change overnight.
Also, beware because we are a more dense state and we have more crowding. You look at some of those other states, they are rural states. They don't have large congregations. They don't have apartments buildings where everybody goes into one elevator. We have the density. We have the crowding. You start to see an increase it's going to take off and that's how we got here in the first place. I don't know how many other ways to say it. We also have the largest number of protesters out there and we're still not sure what the effect of the protesters is. And that won't show up, I've asked them to get tested. We've made testing available for protesters, but that may not show up for a couple of weeks.
So, caution people have to do their part. Be smart. It is all up to you. It is all up to you. Government did nothing. I did nothing for the past 100 days. All I did was give information to people and then people acted intelligent. That has been our success story and that's what we have to keep doing. And that's what I meant by being New York tough. Be smart. Be united. Be disciplined. Be loving.

In interview with Arab News, the Armenian diplomat says Yerevan will not allow ""another genocide"" against Armenians
He says the ethnic Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh have all the rights to live in their ancestors' historical land without fear
NEW YORK CITY: As the death toll continues to climb in the latest violence between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the separatist territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, diplomatic efforts to find a solution to the decades-old rivalry have intensified.
Russia, France, and the US — co-chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group created in 1992 to encourage a negotiated resolution to the conflict — have called for an immediate cease-fire and a return to negotiations without delay.
Russia has offered to host talks between the foreign ministers of the warring countries, insisting there is no alternative to ""political and diplomatic methods"" for resolving the crisis.
The UN Security Council has issued a similar call to urgently resume talks without preconditions, backing an earlier appeal by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to de-escalate the conflict and return to meaningful negotiations.
""Armenia never refused to sit for peaceful negotiations,"" said Mher Margaryan, Armenia's permanent representative to the UN, in an interview with Arab News. ""But it doesn't seem to be the intention of Azerbaijan to follow the calls for peace.""
At the onset of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, Guterres made an appeal for a global cease-fire to help stem the spread of the virus.
""Azerbaijan not only refused to unconditionally support the secretary-general's appeal, but also resorted to a large-scale military intervention,"" added Margaryan.
""The (Azerbaijani) offensive comes amid a global crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, when the international community is focused on fighting the disease.
""Azerbaijan has decided to take advantage of these global vulnerabilities caused by the pandemic. So, this is not just an attack against Armenians but (also) an attack against the basic norms of humanity, an attack against what the UN stands for.""
French President Emmanuel Macron's office said he and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin ""also shared their concern regarding the sending of Syrian mercenaries by Turkey to Nagorno-Karabakh.""
Margaryan said Armenia was very concerned by the alleged involvement of foreign fighters. ""These foreign mercenaries are actually being recruited and transported with the support and encouragement of Turkey. We have to name the names: (The Turks) have been a very destructive element in this conflict. They need to be encouraged to stop.""
The envoy said Azerbaijan's actions, ""while they took the world by surprise,"" had been preceded by ""years of dangerous rhetoric, hate speech and Armeniaphobia, embraced and promulgated at the highest political level.""
""The leadership of Azerbaijan has been promoting hate crimes and glorifying hate criminals. At the same time, they have been spending billions of dollars to acquire deadly offensive weaponry and openly threatening the people of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh with promises to use force.""

Wallace has been a vocal supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement and labelled the incident as a despicable act of racism and hatred. Our North America correspondent Peter Bowes says he's a big figure in the sport. He's become very prominent recently because he's been taking part in those protests after the police killing of George Floyd. But a prominent figure in the sport as well, the only black driver, full-time, with NASCAR - a predominantly white sport. 
But it's the last few weeks that really have attracted a lot of attention to him, perhaps by people who don't follow the sport, because of his involvement with those protests. And also as one of the key campaigners to have the Confederate flag banned from NASCAR. And there was some reluctance from the sport to do that initially, but he was, and others, were eventually successful in achieving that. And it wasn't necessarily a popular decision with every follower of the sport. So this past weekend, the race that he was taking part in was postponed for a day because of the weather, so the track was quite quiet. But this was when the noose was found in the garage for his team. It's been widely condemned and certainly his fellow drivers have rallied around, today - Monday - when the race eventually took place. Some quite emotional scenes as some of the drivers were pushing his car towards the front of the grid. And he was - seemed to be in tears at one point because of the support that he's received. But it is still relatively early days in that investigation, and the FBI now - the federal authorities looking into whether this indeed was a hate crime that they'll be looking into the future. Peter, thank you very much for that. Stay with us on BBC News, still to come: A very green Recital - Barcelona's Opera House reopens with a concert for plants. Members of the neo-Nazi resistance movement stormed the World Trade Center armed with pistols and shotguns. We believe that, according to international law, that we have a rightful claim in certain parts of this country as our land. I take pride in the words ""Ich bin ein Berliner."" CHEERING As the UK woke up to the news that it is to exit the European Union, Leave campaigners began celebrating. In total, 17.4 million people voted for the UK to leave the EU. The Medical Research Council have now advised the government that the great increase in lung cancer is due mainly to smoking tobacco. It was closing time for Checkpoint Charlie, which, for 29 years, has stood on the border as a mark of Allied determination to defend the city. Welcome back, good to have you with us on BBC News.

The sporting goods maker Patagonia is the latest American company to suspend advertising. They say they'll joining the Stop Hate for Profit boycott, at least until the end of July. The company says ""the stakes are too high"" for Facebook to be ""complicit in spreading misinformation and fomenting fear."" Facebook says it is committed to ""advancing equity and racial justice,"" and has long argued it isn't its job to police speech. Jonathan Greenblatt is the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, one of the civil rights groups behind the Stop Hate for Profit campaign. Good to talk to you. Thank you for your time. You have known a lot of campaign groups, a lot of businesses rely on Facebook to maintain their profile. Do you think they really will want to sustain a boycott for very long? Well, look, I think there are a couple of things to point out. First, this is one of the oldest civil rights organisations in the US, and this has been codeveloped by the ADL, the NAACP, and a range of civil rights groups. Number two, we have come together not for a boycott on Facebook, but rather, we call for a pause on advertising for the month of July. And why I am so encouraged is that we have had tremendous positive feedback from companies who agree that"

WASHINGTON - The GOP push against Facebook and Twitter accelerated Thursday after Republican senators threatened the CEOs of the social media companies with subpoenas to force them to address accusations of censorship in the closing weeks of the presidential campaign.
With Democrats boycotting the hearing, the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee voted to authorize the legal orders if Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter's Jack Dorsey did not agree to testify voluntarily.
The committee wants to hear from them about ""the suppression and/or censorship of two news articles from the New York Post,"" according to the subpoena document. Senators also want information from the executives about their companies' policies for moderating content ""that may interfere"" with federal elections.
A Facebook spokesperson declined comment. Twitter representatives didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Facebook and Twitter acted last week to limit the online dissemination and sharing of an unverified political story from the conservative-leaning New York Post that targeted Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. The story, which other publications have not confirmed, cited unverified emails from Biden's son Hunter that were reportedly disclosed by President Donald Trump's allies.
One email purported to show a top adviser for Burisma, the Ukraine gas company where Hunter Biden held a board seat, thanking Biden for giving him an opportunity to meet the elder Biden, who was vice president at the time.
Trump's campaign seized on the report, though the account raised more questions than answers, including whether emails at the center of the story were hacked or fabricated.
It was the first time in recent memory that the two social media platforms enforced rules against misinformation on a story from a mainstream media publication.
With the Nov. 3 election looming, Facebook and Twitter have scrambled to stem the tide of material seen as potentially inciting violence and spreading disinformation and baseless conspiracy theories. Facebook has expanded its restrictions on political advertising, including new bans on messages claiming widespread voter fraud. Trump has raised the prospect of mass fraud in the vote-by-mail process.
The companies also have wrestled with how strongly they should intervene in speech on their platforms.
With Trump leading the way, conservatives have stepped up their claims that Facebook, Twitter and Google, which owns YouTube, are biased, charging without evidence Silicon Valley's social media platforms are deliberately suppressing conservative views.
The Justice Department has asked Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.

Election Protest",FALSE,"The confrontation near the White House between supporters and opponents of President Trump was one of several on Saturday in Washington and in state capitals across the country.
The authorities in Washington, D.C., said on Sunday that they had arrested a man in connection with the stabbing of four people on Saturday night as supporters and opponents of President Trump clashed blocks from the White House.
The four were stabbed outside a bar at 11th and F Streets Northwest around 9 p.m. on Saturday, the Metropolitan Police Department said in a statement. A Washington resident, Phillip Johnson, 29, was arrested and charged with assault with a dangerous weapon, a police spokeswoman said. A police report said he had used a knife.
The confrontation was one of several angry encounters in Washington and in state capitals across the country on Saturday as supporters of Mr. Trump, incensed by a Supreme Court ruling that further dashed the president’s hopes of overturning the results of the November election, clashed with counterprotesters.
In some places, those confrontations escalated into violence, including in Olympia, Wash., where the police declared a riot and one person was shot.
The police incident report on the Washington stabbing said officers who were working the demonstrations responded to reports of a fight outside Harry’s Bar on F Street Northwest, where they found four people with stab wounds. The Washington Post reported that the bar was being used on Saturday as a gathering point for the Proud Boys, a right-wing group known for inciting violence at protests.
The confrontation occurred after dozens of supporters of Mr. Trump, many of whom appeared to be members of the Proud Boys, gathered on the street outside Harry’s Bar. Some of the Trump supporters shouted and pointed at a Black man in dark clothes who was alone and against a wall, according to a journalist who witnessed the confrontation as he was covering the protests for The New York Times.
At least three of the Trump supporters offered to let the man leave and implored the others to let him go in peace. After about a minute, as the man hesitated, more demonstrators closed in and began to punch and kick him, according video footage of the confrontation that was shared by The New York Post.
At that point, the man pulled out a knife and began slashing with it as more demonstrators piled onto him. The man broke free twice, but was then grabbed and beaten again. Police officers intervened after the man was face down on the ground. Several protesters yelled that the man had a knife and had stabbed someone. The man’s face was swollen and bloodied when police officers picked him up.
The victims were conscious and breathing when they were taken to a hospital, a Police Department spokeswoman said on Sunday. Douglas Buchanan, a spokesman for the D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department, said on Sunday that their injuries were not life-threatening.
The police identified the men who had been stabbed as Franklin Todd Gregory of McMinnville, Tenn.; Corey Owen Nielsen of Robbinsdale, Minn.; Jeremy Bertino of Locust, N.C.; and Gregory Lyons, whose hometown was not released. The police said that Mr. Gregory identified Mr. Johnson as the man who had stabbed him.
Mr. Johnson could not be reached on Sunday. It was not immediately clear if he was still in custody or whether he had a lawyer.
Minutes before the stabbings, supporters of Mr. Trump tore down a Black Lives Matter banner and burned it on the street, videos on social media show. The flag was removed from outside the Asbury United Methodist Church, one of the oldest Black churches in Washington, which has stood at the corner of 11th and K Streets Northwest since 1836.
The church’s senior pastor, the Rev. Dr. Ianther M. Mills, said in a statement that the scene reminded her of a cross burning.
“We are a resilient people who have trusted in God through slavery and the Underground Railroad, Jim Crow and the Civil Rights movement,” she said, “and now as we face an apparent rise in white supremacy.”
Another video showed a sign bearing the Black Lives Matter slogan being torn down from the Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church near the corner of 15th and M Streets Northwest. A Police Department spokeswoman said the authorities were aware of the incidents and were investigating them as possible hate crimes.
“DC’s faith-based organizations are at the very heart of our community, giving us hope in the face of darkness,” Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington said in a statement on Facebook. “They embody our DC values of love and inclusivity. An attack on them is an attack on all of us.”
The Police Department spokeswoman said that eight officers were injured during the protests on Sunday. Two of those officers sustained serious but not life-threatening injuries and were also taken to hospitals, said Mr. Buchanan, the Fire and Emergency Medical Services spokesman.
A total of 33 people were arrested in Washington from Saturday afternoon into Sunday morning in connection with the protests, mostly for various types of assault, including assault on police officers, according to a Police Department arrest database.
In videos of a clash in Olympia, Wash., that were posted on social media, a single gunshot can be heard as counterprotesters advance on members of a pro-Trump group on Saturday, including one person on a sidewalk who is waving a large Trump flag. After the gunshot, one of the counterprotesters can be seen falling to the ground as others call for help. In another video, a man with a gun can be seen running from the scene and putting on a red hat.
Forest Michael Machala, 25, of Shoreline, Wash., was arrested on a first-degree assault charge, Chris Loftis, a spokesman for the Washington State Patrol, said on Sunday.
The gunfire in Olympia came after supporters of Mr. Trump and counterprotesters gathered near the State Capitol on Saturday afternoon and clashed before the shooting.
The Olympia police said there were four arrests and that four officers had been injured, according to the CBS affiliate KIRO.

137,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_751/Files (250).DOCX","Newstex Blogs",2020-08-16,"766 words",NA,"Dave Blount",NA,"What Biden Presidency Would Mean for Gun Rights",FALSE,"Aug 16, 2020( Moonbattery: http://www.moonbattery.com/ Delivered by Newstex) Lately the country feels like it is sliding toward ruin, which won't make November easy on the incumbent. Given enough help from the media, Biden could win from his basement, even after his lurch to the left. Moonbattery.com sponsor Ammo.com presents the implications[1] for our right to bear arms. 
Biden has a history of hostility toward gun rights: He voted for the 1986 Firearms Owners Protection Act[2], which was primarily a series of gimmes to gun grabbers in exchange for getting the ATF to leave law-abiding gun owners alone. Biden was also instrumental in the passage of the Brady Bill[3]. Biden literally wrote the bill[4] that banned so-called 'assault weapons' in the United States for 20 years. The worst is yet to come. Biden and/or his handlers plan devious tactics to undercut the Second Amendment. One example is to declare gun violence a 'public health epidemic,' giving the FDA power to punitively tax, regulate, and/or ban firearms. Another is to allow lawsuits against gun manufacturers for the misuse of their products. When facing such liability, gun manufacturers will be inundated with frivolous lawsuits[5] that will cause them to either go out of business or discontinue their civilian lines entirely. Biden has previously voted to repeal these protections In addition, he will continue the progressive approach of gradually gnawing away at our gun rights, making it ever more expensive and difficult to exercise them. He will ban the importation of 'assault weapons' by executive order, and push for a new assault weapons ban at least as repressive as the old one that expired. As for the AR-15s we already have, they will either be confiscated by mandatory 'buyback' or registered for confiscation at a future time. He would also limit firearm purchases to one per month, close the 'gun show loophole' among various other supposed loopholes, deny gun rights on the grounds of 'mental health,' deny them on the grounds of having committed a 'hate crime,' and ban all online sales of guns, ammunition, kits, and parts. The Biden platform would move to require all gun manufacturers to eventually manufacture only so-called 'smart guns.' He would pass a law that would require all gun owners to keep their firearms in a gun safe, dramatically increasing the cost of ownership of firearms. Biden also likes red flag laws and license requirements. Local law enforcement often hesitates to deprive Americans of constitutional rights. Democrat hostility to local law enforcement has been conspicuous lately, driving the National Association of Police Organizations[6] and the New York City Police Benevolent Association[7] to endorse Trump. The feds have their own enforcement mechanisms. The Biden platform includes creating a gun confiscation framework overseen by the ATF and the FBI. It's hard to trust the FBI in light of James Comey, Peter Strzok, et al. It will be harder still when one of Biden's hard left handlers takes over as Attorney General. Biden's inauguration would not be a happy day for gun owners. Still less happy days would follow in the future.

139,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_751/Files (250).DOCX","Impact News Service",2020-10-10,"1026 words",NA,NA,NA,"Nicaragua: Ortega Tightening Authoritarian Grip",FALSE,"New York: Human Rights Watch has issued the following press release:
Member states of the Organization of American States (OAS) should urgently raise concerns about Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega’s efforts to tighten his government’s grip on independent journalists and human rights groups, Human Rights Watch said today.
On September 22, 2020, pro-government lawmakers introduced a “foreign agents” bill that would allow Ortega’s government to exert control over the work of virtually anyone who receives funding or support from abroad, including rights groups and independent media outlets. On September 28, pro-government lawmakers introduced a “cybercrime” bill, criminalizing the spread of “fake news” and other speech on the Internet, which could be used to censor and punish free expression.
“These bills appear designed to provide legal cover for the Ortega government to harass and prosecute journalists, rights groups, and virtually anyone who criticizes his government,” said José Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at Human Rights Watch. “OAS member states should not stay silent as Ortega tightens his grip on critical voices in the country.”
The “foreign agents” bill requires people or entities to register as “foreign agents” with the Interior Ministry if they “directly or indirectly” receive funding from abroad. People and entities must also register if they work under the “instructions, supervision or control” of people who answer to foreign “governments, capital, businesses, or funds” or if they represent the “interests” of foreign “governments, foundations, businesses, or organisms.” Those failing to register could face fines, the cancellation of the entity’s official registration in Nicaragua, and confiscation of their property.
Under the bill, those registered as “foreign agents” can face undefined “legal sanctions” if they intervene in “issues, activities or matters of internal politics.” The bill would also forbid the individuals registered as “foreign agents” from running for public office until a year after they have withdrawn their registration and the government has verified that they are not receiving foreign funding.
Human Rights Watch has documented how other countries, such as Russia, have used similar “foreign agents” laws to silence civil society. The European Parliament has condemned Russia’s law – which is the subject of multiple challenges before the European Court of Human Rights – as a tool to stifle dissent, and the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights has made clear it violates international norms.
The “cybercrime bill” includes several broad provisions that are particularly threatening to media freedom. It would establish criminal sentences of up to four years in prison for anyone who uses communications technology to “publish” or “disseminate” “false or distorted information, likely to spread anxiety, anguish or fear.” It would also punish with up to five years in prison anyone who publishes “false or distorted information” that “promotes hate and violence, [or] endangers economic stability, public order or health, or national security,” terms that are not defined under the bill.
The bill would punish with prison time the use of communications technology to disclose classified information as well as information considered “personal.” It would also punish with prison sentences of three to five years anyone who uses technology to “praise” crimes or people who have committed crimes, and with two to four years anyone who uses technology to threaten to harm someone’s reputation or to divulge “secrets” that could harm someone.
Under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the American Convention on Human Rights (ACHR), both ratified by Nicaragua, laws may only limit the rights to free speech and freedom of association when necessary and proportionate to achieve a legitimate goal, such as the protection of national security or the rights of others. The proposed bills include multiple overbroad provisions that are inconsistent with international human rights law and could be easily used to target critics and the media, Human Rights Watch said.
In addition to the “foreign agents” and “cybercrimes” bills, on September 15, Vice President Rosario Murillo, President Ortega’s wife, said that the government would propose a constitutional amendment to allow life sentences for “hate crimes.” Nicaraguan law does not address “hate crimes,” although the government has often accused critics and political opponents of committing them.
The government first mentioned the idea of a “hate crimes” amendment in connection with the murder of two girls, ages 10 and 12, in the Mulukukú municipality in September. In a speech discussing the cases, Ortega suggested that political opponents and protesters “wanted to continue murdering, using bombs, causing destruction,” although his government has shared no evidence linking them to these specific crimes.
Given the Nicaraguan government’s record of targeting journalists and opponents, its rhetoric about a “hate crimes” amendment seems like yet another effort to intimidate critics, Human Rights Watch said.
In 2018, a brutal crackdown on protesters by Nicaragua’s National Police and armed pro-government groups left over 300 people dead and 2,000 injured and resulted in hundreds of arbitrary arrests and prosecutions. The government stripped 10 nongovernmental organizations of their legal registration, forcing them to close, and harassed and detained journalists.
On September 14, the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights reported that about 94 people “perceived as opponents to the government” remained in prison. Serious human rights violations, including torture and extrajudicial killings, committed during the 2018 crackdown have gone unpunished.
“Despite the government’s brutal crackdown and the hostile environment they face, many media outlets and rights groups continue to expose abuses by the Ortega administration,” Vivanco said. “But Ortega’s new legislative initiatives could end up suffocating the work of civil society and journalists in Nicaragua.”"

Stonington police said 39-year-old Philip Sarner, and Emily Orbay, 27, each listed as former residents of Nassau County, N.Y., "" were taken into custody in Brooklyn, N.Y., early Monday morning and charged as fugitives from justice following an almost two-week search.
The couple was deported to Connecticut later in the day.
Both are facing third-degree assault and other charges.
The U.S. Marshals Service and New York City Police Department arrested the couple during the early morning hours, bringing to an end a search that started when the pair fled following an assault at the Quality Inn Mystic on Whitehall Avenue that left 59-year-old Chrystal Caldwell of Groton injured.
Shortly before noon on June 26, police were summoned to the Whitehall Avenue hotel after receiving two 911 calls reporting an assault of a hotel worker, later identified as Caldwell. While police were on their way to the hotel, they said a second, more violent attack occurred. Caldwell has maintained that the couple threatened extreme violence and made several degrading statements toward her, including calling her an ""old monkey"" and telling her that her life doesn't matter.
The police met Caldwell and hotel staff in the parking lot, at which time officers also spoke with Sarner and Orbay. Police said all three complained of injuries, and Caldwell was taken to Pequot Health Center while Sarner and Orbay were taken to Lawrence + Memorial Hospital in New London.
Officers did not wait with the pair at L+M, which police said was due in part to concerns about and confusion over COVID-19 procedures, and surveillance video later showed the suspects arrive back at the hotel in a Lyft before immediately getting into their car and leaving. It took the suspects less than a minute to get in their car, and the police said they did not retrieve their belongings from inside the hotel.
Stonington police continued to investigate and on July 1, the department obtained warrants for both Sarner and Orbay from the New London State's Attorney. The warrant was later updated to include the bias and bigotry charges.
The department has received heavy criticism of its handling of the investigation. Stonington First Selectman Danielle Chesebrough said Monday that concerns over transparency led Police Chief J. Darren Stewart and members of the Board of Police Commissioners to request an independent, third-party review.
The town announced Friday that it had hired an independent consultant, attorney Frank E. Rudewicz of the Boston-based legal firm Blum Shapiro, to begin an investigation into the department's handling of the incident and review both its response and the department's policies.
Chesebrough said. ""Chief Stewart and (Commission Chairman) Henri Gourd have been very proactive and supportive of this review. I think, as far as bringing a request to the town, they know how important community trust is and this is an effort to enhance transparency.""
The contract will require the town to pay for services ""not to exceed $15,000"" that will include a formalized review and report, which will be made public, for both the incident and other department policies, including use of force and police intervention.
The town continues to work with Rudewicz to establish a timeline for the investigation.
Chesebrough said, ""This is very much a time-sensitive matter and I expect there will be an aggressive timeline.We need to make sure this doesn't continue to drag on, but we want to make sure there is a thorough, complete review that will help identify any areas where maybe things could be done more efficiently.""
Sarner and Orbay are both charged with third-degree assault and intimidation based on bigotry and bias, Connecticut's statute for hate crimes. Sarner was also hit with one count of second-degree assault. 2020 Legal Monitor Worldwide."

I saw a poll the other day released by CNN that shows Biden decisively beating Trump in November... sort of. 55% of registered voters say they will cast their ballots for Biden and just 41% say they'll vote for Señor Trumpanzee. That's a mammoth gap. BUT... just 37% of those Biden voters say they are voting for him, as opposed to 60% who say they are voting against Trump. 
That's an important distinction. (70% of Trump's voters are voting for Trump.)Personally, I like voting for someone, not against someone worse. Biden is so the wrong man for this time. I can hardly think of any plausible Democrat who would be worse. (NOTE: Bloomberg is neither plausible nor a Democrat.) But Trump is not just worse. Trump appears to be an existential threat to democracy, America, the planet. Biden is... well, just ole Status Quo Joe.

And now he has a team to figure that out for him and... well, he''ll be less likely to follow some of his worst instincts any longer. Some of them. But don't kid yourself about what the contours of a Biden presidency is going to look like. One place to start is looking at the 100 billionaires bankrolling his ascension to the presidency[3]--men and women who aren't writing big checks because they like his facelifts and cosmetic dental work. Last month, Forbes made that task easy for us to see. Is 100 a lot? Well, it's actually 94 but,, yeah, it's a record number of billionaires-- and 2 more than Trump has. Yesterday Business Insider updated the Biden and the billionaires[4] story. Hit the link to find all the billionaires giving Biden relatively small contributions and how LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman gave his SuperPAC millions, but there are other ways of looking at Biden's unsuitability.Jacob Rosenberg at Mother Jones camp up with a perfect example that harkens back to that Washington Post headline up top: Joe Biden Doesn't Want to Defund the Police[5]. He wrote that Biden issued a statement[6] making it clear as day that he ""would not support defunding the police. He did say there is an 'urgent need for reform,' and he advocated for body-worn cameras and further diversification of the police force... This isn't surprising news, exactly. Biden is a moderate. But it's remarkable that he had to clarify his position at all. The Minneapolis City Council announced on Sunday it was disbanding the police to invest in community programs. Other municipalities are considering similar action. A world without cops, as our own Madison Pauly wrote[7] about, is not only imaginable but increasingly something activists are putting on concrete lists of demands.

My opponent, as recently as 2012, congratulated two police departments in Jersey City and Bayonne on $3 million grants to militarize local police forces. Just this week local activists went toe-to-toe, and won a fight against the unanimously Democratic Hudson County establishment, that in this political climate sought to spend $26k in taxpayer funds, to purchase riot gear[8]. This announcement comes on the heels of two weeks of completely peaceful protests in New Jersey. After community activists mobilized, the local machinery backed down[9]. Today, this campaign released its Social Justice platform that seeks to demilitarize the police, end the War on Drugs, abolish Qualified Immunity, and make ""White Caller Crime"" a federal hate crime. We are all too familiar with instances of White individuals calling the police on Black people for simply existing[10]. These frivolous calls waste public resources, endanger the lives of Black brothers and sisters, and we should treat these 'White Called Crimes' as federal hate crimes.

Whether it's Ebola, cholera and now COVID-19, Jesse Verschuere has witnessed ""a pattern of stigma against others in every disease outbreak"" he has responded to as part of the international medical humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders.
The objects of prejudice have included health-care workers, minorities, immigrants, indeed any outsider or other who looks or acts different from those in the local community, says the Belgium-based Verschuere, who works to improve the ability of communities to obtain health care.
This bias occurs around the world.
And it's not anything new.
Villainizing an unknown other as guilty of spreading, causing or exploiting disease has a long, hate-filled history, says Debora MacKenzie, author of the new book Covid-19: The Pandemic That Should Never Have Happened and How to Stop the Next One.
Back in 14th-century Europe, Jews were blamed - and thousands of them slaughtered - by Christian mobs who baselessly accused them of spreading the deadly bubonic plague by poisoning wells and streams. In 19th-century America, immigrants from Ireland, Italy and China were censured, variously and also baselessly, for bringing with them cholera and polio, among other feared infections.
So perhaps it shouldn't be a surprise that in the wake of COVID-19, the blame game is playing out once again.
A global sampling:
In the United States, where some leaders have used the racist term ""Kung flu"" to describe COVID-19, increased verbal and physical assaults against Asian Americans have been linked to the virus. In one documented incident, a woman who is originally from Taiwan and has lived in New York City for 16 years filmed a video on the subway of a man accusing her of spreading ""Kung flu."" Responding to the surge in anti-Asian verbal and physical assaults, the New York Police Department has this month announced the formation of an Asian Hate Crime Task Force.
In the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kinshasha-based photo journalist Justin Makangara reports, misinformation has led to a number of different potential scapegoats for COVID-19: ""There is a lot of misinformation, there is a rumor that it is a disease of the rich, a disease of foreigners according to many people. In a state where religion and belief are important, the virus is also associated with punishment from the gods. The government is also accused of inflating the numbers of cases in order to receive funding from structures like WHO, and to allow donor countries like China to sell a lot of masks. Many continue to be suspicious of imported masks.""
In Haiti, medical workers are often distrusted and ostracized. According to reports from Doctors Without Borders, one pervasive myth is that hospital patients who seek help for COVID-19 will instead receive a fatal injection. The more people who die, it's alleged, the more money the government will receive as part of a corrupt ploy to exploit unsuspecting citizens.
In Malaysia, authorities have used COVID-19 as a pretext to target - and exacerbate prejudice against - immigrants, refugees, asylum seekers and the Rohingya community, says Doctors Without Borders head of mission Dirk van der Tak. Immigration raids purportedly aimed at stopping the spread of the disease by these groups coming from outside the country in fact ended up sparking new disease clusters in the overcrowded detention centers where the detainees were sent. This has further served to reinforce anti-immigrant sentiment, hate speech, stigma, and the blaming of groups from outside the country for the transmission of COVID-19.
This link between disease and blame is rooted in evolution, says Mark Schaller, a professor of psychology at the University of British Columbia and co-author of Social Psychology of Prejudice. According to Schaller, aversion to unfamiliar outsiders is an instinctual, unconscious response to avoid the risk of infection. It forms part of what he calls the behavioral immune system, a kind of psychological parallel to the physical immune system.
This aversion to outsiders may have served a purpose long ago in avoiding unknown (and unfamiliar-looking) groups that could harbor unknown illnesses. ""This underlying psychology evolved in a different world, before modern medicine or public health, and is no longer adaptive,"" Schaller says. ""But we're stuck with our ancient psychology, leaving us wary and with negative consequences for today"" - notably, prejudicial and discriminatory responses to people perceived to be different.
Singling out immigrants in particular for scapegoating is one such negative consequence, says Tahseen Shams, assistant professor of sociology at University of Toronto and author of Here, There, and Elsewhere: The Making of Immigrant Identities in a Globalized World. As examples, she points to the 1980s, when Haitian refugees and Africans were among those blamed for the AIDS epidemic, and to the current surge of anti-Asian racism.
When external threats occur, immigrant groups are often seen ""as the link bringing the threat inside our borders, closer to home,"" she explains. And that, she says, leads to stigma and harassment.
The Ebola outbreak has such examples. In 2014, when a traveler from Liberia developed Ebola while visiting family in Dallas, the city's African immigrant community was targeted and stigmatized, says Kevin J.A. Thomas, professor of African American and African Diaspora studies at the University of Texas, Austin and author of Global Epidemics, Local Implications: African immigrants and the Ebola Crisis in Dallas.
""People were already traumatized by losing family to Ebola in Africa,"" he says, citing one pastor in the community mourning the loss of six family members in a single week. Then they had to deal with demeaning racist tropes in local media as well.
In this instance, the community found ways to counteract the prejudice they were facing, Thomas said. For example, they assisted with contact tracing of those who had interacted with the infected person.
Even those who come specifically to help in a medical crisis can be blamed, stigmatized, distrusted as outsiders who hurt rather than heal.
For international emergency medical teams who come from afar to succeed, building trust with the larger community is the cornerstone to countering such prejudice, says Karin Huster, an emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders. She worked in countries in West Africa during the Ebola outbreak in 2014-2016, a period when some health clinics and their workers were attacked by community members they aimed to help.
""We were arrogant"" and did not take the time to explain what Ebola was, or try to understand their concerns, Huster says. ""All of a sudden someone dressed in a moon suit starts bringing sick people into a newly built unit, and drags dead people out in a plastic bag. Wouldn't you run away if you saw this?""
Having learned from those errors, the organization deploys a variety of strategies to include the community, reach out to local leaders, present accurate medical information and track and correct rumors, says Verschuere, with social media being one way to mitigate stigma and fear.
In the same way that prejudice manifests in every setting, the goal in counter-acting it is also the same: to bring out the humanity. By contrast, stigma does just the opposite, he says: It strips people's humanity away.

143,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_751/Files (250).DOCX","Japan Economic Newswire",2020-12-08,"534 words",NA,NA,NA,"New Zealand's Ardern vows changes in wake of mosque attack report",FALSE," The New Zealand government will introduce a raft of initiatives in response to an independent investigation into the March 2019 terror attacks on two mosques in Christchurch in which 51 people were killed, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Tuesday.
 The almost 800-page Royal Commission report, released the same day, investigated what public sector agencies knew in the lead up to the terror attack, whether agencies failed to anticipate such an incident, and their response to the worst mass shooting in New Zealand's history.
 With the exception of the manifesto that shooter, Brenton Tarrant, a white supremacist from Australia, emailed to multiple organizations and government offices minutes before opening fire on two mosques in central Christchurch, the report found that no single incident could have alerted relevant agencies to the impending shooting.
 However, the report also found failings in the police gun licensing system and said the country's counter-terrorism and security agencies showed disproportionate scrutiny toward the threat of terrorism committed by Muslim extremists and did not address the risks of right-wing extremism.
 Speaking at a press conference, Ardern said the government has in principle accepted all 44 of the recommendations contained in the report.
 ""On behalf of the government, I apologize,"" she said.
 Among the initiatives Ardern said the government will introduce are placing a minister in charge of coordinating and implementing the recommendations and amending laws to strengthen counter-terrorism legislation.
 She said the government will also place greater focus on supporting and strengthening social cohesion and extend government funding to help communities at risk of hate crimes and terrorism to upgrade their security arrangements.
 ""Ultimately this roughly 800 page report can be distilled into one simple premise: Muslim New Zealanders should be safe. Anyone who calls New Zealand home, regardless of race, religion, sexual orientation or gender, should be safe,"" Ardern said.
 At a separate press conference, members of Christchurch's Muslim community expressed their gratitude that the report acknowledged their long-held concerns that intelligence services had failed to investigate threats to the community by the far right.
 Imam Gamal Fouda of the Al Noor Mosque, the location that saw the highest casualties, said he had previously reported suspicious people in the vicinity of the mosque, and was disappointed by the lack of action taken by police.
 Fouda recalled the global response after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks on New York City and called on New Zealanders to respond differently.
 ""The approach after 9/11 was to match an attack of hate with further attacks. That approach left humanity no closer to bridging our divides,"" he said. ""We ask our beloved country of Aotearoa (New Zealand) to chart a different course. This is a course that is not of division but one of unity, compassion, kindness and aroha (love).""
 In August, Tarrant became the first person in New Zealand to receive a sentence of life without parole, after pleading guilty to 51 charges of murder, 40 counts of attempted murder and one charge of terrorism.

Bodies thrown in the air, lifted onto windshields or trapped under cars and semitrucks. It's become a horrifying and familiar scene in recent weeks.
Amid thousands of protests nationwide against police brutality, dozens of drivers have plowed into crowds of protesters marching in roadways.
Witnesses, law enforcement and terrorism experts said some of the vehicle incidents appear to be targeted and politically motivated; others appear to be situations in which the driver became frightened or enraged by protesters surrounding their vehicle.
""There are groups that do want people to take their cars and drive them into Black Lives Matters protesters so that they won't protest anymore. There's an element of terrorism there. Is it all of them? No,"" said J.J. MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University's Program on Extremism. ""I look at it as an anti-protester group of acts, some of which are white supremacist, some not.""
There have been at least 66 incidents of cars driving into protesters from May 27 to July 6, including 59 by civilians and seven by law enforcement, according to Ari Weil, a terrorism researcher at the University of Chicago's Project on Security and Threats. Weil began tracking the incidents as protests sprung up in the wake of George Floyd's death in police custody.
There have been two fatalities - in Seattle and in Bakersfield, California - and at least 24 of the civilian cases have been charged by law enforcement, Weil said.
At least 19 incidents malicious
Many of the incidents were captured in photos or videos shared on social media: Two New York police vehicles plowed into demonstrators as the crowd pushed a barricade against one of them; a woman in a black SUV drove through a crowd in Denver; a Detroit police vehicle accelerated away with a man flailing on the hood.
This week, drivers struck protesters in Bloomington, Indiana, and Huntington Station, New York. Similar scenes played out in Los Angeles, Boston, Tulsa, Oklahoma, Tallahassee, Florida, and San Jose, California.
Weil said that by analyzing news coverage, court documents and patterns of behavior - such as when people allegedly yelled slurs at protesters or turned around for a second hit - he determined that at least 19 of the 59 civilian incidents were malicious and four were not. Weil said he did not have enough information to classify the motives of the remaining 36 incidents.
One of the more ""clear-cut"" cases of malice, MacNab said, was in early June in Lakeside, Virginia. An ""avowed Klansman"" drove up to protesters on a roadway, revved his engine, then drove through the crowd, wounding one person, Henrico County Commonwealth's Attorney Shannon Taylor said in a statement.
The 36-year-old man was ""a propagandist of Confederate ideology,"" Taylor said. He was charged with four counts of assault with hate crimes, two counts of felonious attempted malicious wounding and one count of felony hit and run.
""We lived through this in Virginia in Charlottesville in 2017,"" Taylor said, referring to when a neo-Nazi plowed his car through a crowd of counterprotesters at a Unite the Right rally, killing Heather Heyer. The driver was sentenced to life in prison on hate crime charges.
Last month in Visalia, California, occupants of a Jeep displaying a ""Keep America Great"" flag hit two protesters in the road, causing minor injuries, according to Visalia police. Witnesses said those inside the car mocked protesters by cupping their ears as if they couldn't hear their chants. The protesters started chanting profanities and throwing items before they approached the Jeep, which accelerated, hitting the protesters before driving off.
County prosecutors didn't charge the driver Wednesday, saying the protesters involved weren't ""seriously injured"" and the driver and his passengers felt threatened. Other civilians and police officers have similarly claimed that they drove through protesters because they were afraid of them and wanted to escape the situation.
MacNab noted that ""some of that fear is going to come from racism and bigotry.""
Videos become a meme
Officials in Minnesota said last month that a 35-year-old semitruck driver who drove through a crowd of thousands of protesters on a bridge did not deliberately target the group. A lawyer for a man who hit two protesters in Seattle, killing one, said the crash was a ""horrible, horrible accident."" Prosecutors filed three felony charges against the man Wednesday.
Video of many of the vehicle rammings has circulated on social media, including white supremacist websites, according to MacNab, who said she has seen ""revolting"" commentary on videos shared to white supremacist accounts on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter.
""This has become something of a meme in white supremacy circles. There'll be a picture of a car driving into a crowd, and then there will be a humorous remark about it. It's definitely part of the discourse,"" said Daniel Byman, a senior fellow at Brookings who researches counterterrorism and Middle East security. ""They're doing a lot of kidding-not-kidding sort of humor ... which is the modern white supremacist world.""
Byman said he's seen a meme shared by the Charlottesville killer circulating in white supremacist circles. Right-wing extremists turned the man into ""a bit of a saint"" after the killing, MacNab said.
'ISIS made it a science'
Vehicles have been used as tools of terror for decades, but it's become more common in the past 10 years, experts said. The Islamic State disseminated information about how to use the tactic, said Lorenzo Vidino, director of George Washington University's Program on Extremism.
""Between 2014 and 2017, we saw several attacks, and ISIS was very meticulous in a variety of languages that gave clear instructions about what trucks to use, how to rent a truck and how to hit a group,"" Vidino said. ""ISIS made it a science.""
Most of those attacks were in Europe and the Middle East, Vidino said. Terrorists influenced by the Islamic State used vehicles to kill people in Nice, France, in 2016 and on London Bridge in 2017. That year, a man influenced by the Islamic State killed eight people when he drove a pickup about 1 mile in Lower Manhattan.
Other extremist groups borrowed the tactic, Vidino said. In 2018, a member of a misogynist online subculture drove a van into downtown Toronto, killing 10 people.
The vehicular attacks have been ""the trademark of the affiliated wannabes that are at times extremely deadly,"" he said.
The tactic is cheap and doesn't take much coordination or organizational support. It's also ""camera-friendly,"" Vidino said.
""The Charlottesville attack, it killed one person, but it stuck in everybody's mind because you have the spectacle of bodies flying. It's catchy. And that's what a lot of extremists pursue. It terrorized people,"" he said.
In the USA, the tactic was introduced by the far-right around 2016 to attack Black Lives Matter protests and demonstrations against the Dakota Access Pipeline, Weil said in a Twitter thread. That's when ""the right began creating memes to celebrate"" the attacks, he said.
""I would be very careful in the middle of the street,"" MacNab said. ""There's a significant amount of people who think that any protester hit in the street has it coming, and that's a dangerous mindset.""

'The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing crisis for our country. Over 6.6 million Americans have been infected, and almost 200,000 have died from COVID-19. It has upended the lives of almost every American in some way and it will continue to do so for some time as we brace for a potential second wave of infections.
'On top of bearing the burdens that the pandemic has imposed on all Americans, Asian-Americans have been forced to carry the added anxiety of confronting racial prejudice, including racially-motivated harassment and violence, stemming from a stigma that has unfairly associated them with COVID-19 because of the virus’s origins in China, a stigma that has been reinforced by rhetoric suggesting such a link.
'According to the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, since March 19, there have been almost 2,600 cases of anti-Asian discrimination related to COVID-19. According to the resolution, at the pandemic’s earliest stage in this country, between February 9 and March 7, there were over 400 such incidents.
'These include the stabbings of an Asian-American father and his two young children, ages 2 and 6, in Texas.
'Public health entities including the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have recognized that labeling a virus by geographic or ethnic terms unfairly stigmatizes certain communities and ultimately harms public health. For this reason, Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar rightly condemned the use of the phrase 'Chinese virus' in testimony before the Ways and Means Committee, stating that 'ethnicity is not what causes the novel coronavirus.'
'It is incumbent on all public figures, including elected officials like us, to publicly condemn bigotry and the stigmatization of racial or ethnic groups unfairly targeted for blame. We must speak out clearly against such attitudes and acts of hate whenever they occur, but particularly in the face of public panic or fear during a national emergency, when society can be especially vulnerable to racist appeals and prejudices.
'While many public figures have admirably sought to end COVID-19-related racial animosity, some, unfortunately, appear not to share the same sense of moral duty. Rather than using their bully pulpits to confront prejudice and racial hatred, they have, instead, chosen repeatedly to use derogatory and prejudicial phrases and remarks reinforcing the exclusion and stigmatization of Asian-Americans in the face of a national crisis—a tactic that, sadly, has a long and ugly history in our country. Left unchecked, this type of rhetoric has, in the past, led to grave injustices like the Chinese Exclusion Act and the internment of Japanese-Americans during the Second World War.
'In the year 2020, condemning bigotry and racial scapegoating should not be hard for any Member of this House to do. It is long past time to leave the days of 'yellow peril' hysteria and unjustified blame of the “other” behind. The House can take an important step in that direction by passing H.

TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF BREAKING NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Angela Ruch -- yes, and that's it. It's a great phrase. Thank you both for joining us. Best of luck to you.
That is ""The Story"" of Wednesday, July 8, 2020, but as always, ""The Story"" continues. We'll see you back here tomorrow night at seven. Tucker Carlson right now.
TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.
Tom Friedman has been a columnist at the New York Times for 25 years. In that quarter century, Friedman has raised banality and cliche mongering to a kind of art form. Like Picasso, he wastes nothing.
There's not a single piece of mindless conventional wisdom floating around Washington or New York City that Tom Friedman hasn't managed to whip into a hasty column at one time or another.
Naturally, our ruling class loves him. They consider him brilliant. They read Tom Friedman on the Peloton every morning and they feel affirmed. He is as dumb as they are.
We refer you to Friedman's column this morning because there is no question, it is taste of things to come and very soon.
In that column Friedman calls for Joe Biden to skip the fall presidential debates. For cover, Friedman adds a couple of silly caveats.
Biden should only consider debating, he writes, if Donald Trump releases years of his personal tax returns, and then agrees to have a panel of journalists sit on stage to call him a liar in real time. Otherwise, no debating.
It turns out Tom Friedman is not really a genius. So, it's pretty obvious what's going on here. This is the most cynical election strategy ever devised or ever perpetrated on American voters. Hide the candidate until Election Day, the country can find out what's in the administration after it's in power, but until then, no appearing in public, and my God, don't ever tell the truth.
So will the Biden campaign take Tom Friedman's advice? Well, of course they will take it, because they have no choice. Biden is up in the polls as of right now, so they can't let him talk. That could wreck everything.
People might discover that Joe Biden bears no resemblance to the Joe Biden they remember.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOE BIDEN (D), PRESUMPTIVE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: They would put 720 million women back in the workforce.
TEXT: While campaigning in New Hampshire.
BIDEN: I love this place. Look, what's not to like about Vermont in terms the beauty of it and what a neat town.
Poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.
We choose science over fiction. We choose truth over facts.
Think about it. We hold these truths to be self-evident. All men and women are created by -- oh, you know the -- you know the thing.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: You know the thing. In fact, we do know the thing. But poor Joe Biden does not know the thing, and at times, Biden doesn't seem to know anything or even to recognize his own wife.
Imagine Biden spending six hours on stage with Donald Trump trading jabs on live television. No, he can't do that, so he is not going to do that.
Instead, they're going to keep Joe Biden hidden behind the curtain. He'll read prepared speeches from time to time. On a good day, he can pull that off, but nothing extemporaneous or off the cuff. He is not capable of that.
It's all pretty shocking if you think about it. We've kind of accepted it, but pull back a little bit. They're running a candidate for President who cannot govern and they know that and they're doing it anyway.
So what does that say about the people around Joe Biden? Well, they are ruthless, obviously, and they're not into debate, not just presidential debates, but any debate. They don't like being disagreed with. They don't believe that there are two sides to any question. They believe their own views are the only legitimate views.
When you criticize them, they won't engage with you. They don't bother to rebut your points. They simply attack you.
Joe Biden himself attacked this show today, in fact. He didn't respond to the questions that we raised. He just called us names, and then his minions tried to pull us off the air.
We survived because thank God we work here. But you should know that's how they plan to run the country. Biden will pick some running mate whose identity makes it impossible for anyone to criticize her, and then they'll describe any criticism of their governance as a hate crime. We got a taste of that for eight years under Barack Obama, you know this -- you know how it works.
And of course, they've been doing it for years on college campuses and in corporate diversity seminars, any place where they have total control.
Now the entire American population is getting the very same treatment.
Tonight, for example, close to a thousand companies are boycotting Facebook's advertising platform. Why are they doing that? Because they're demanding that Facebook censor the President and his voters, ban conservative news outlets, allow only publications controlled by the left to decide, what is news?
It lets most anyway, because there's only one mass media company left in America that consistently dissents from the left's view of things. You're watching it right now.
What do you think they plan to do to Fox News if they take power? You can imagine, we're in their way.
So, these people aren't liberals. We call them that, but they're not. They don't wring their hands and wonder what to do next like your flaky fifth grade teacher who wore sandals and worried about the fate of the baby harp seals or with a ""Save the whales"" sticker on her Volvo. No, they're nothing like that.
They're not sentimental. These are totalitarians. They know exactly what they want. They don't wring their hands. They want power and they know how to get power.
Why are so many people being fired right now for absurdly trivial offenses? Liking the wrong tweet? Commenting on the wrong post? Making the wrong hand gesture accidentally? Why is that happening?
Simple. To terrify the rest of us into obedience. We better not say that, we could be hurt, too. That's the lesson we take as we watch people around us fired and destroyed for doing very small things.
That tells us the people around Joe Biden, they're the ones doing this, rule by fear. They do not rule by consent as you're supposed to in this country. They are in fact the true enemies of democracy. They don't care what you think.
And just in case the rest of us missed the point, they are working hard to make self-defense against their mobs, their militia a crime. You cannot resist us, or we will prosecute you.
St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner is threatening to arrest Mark and Patricia McCloskey for daring to defend themselves against a mob that was threatening to murder them, a mob of democratic voters, but they're the criminals.
This is why the left wants to abolish the police. They're not abolishing law enforcement, they are replacing them with a woke militia of armed social workers, psychologists and ethnic studies majors. Obedient Democratic voters.
And it's why in places where the police still exist, they want to make certain you're too afraid to call them. In San Francisco, Supervisor Shamann Walton has introduced the Caution Against Racially Exploitative Non-Emergencies or Caren Act. Hilarious if you think about it.
A law we're told is against hate that is named after a racial slur, but it's not actually funny. The bill would make it a hate crime for citizens to call law enforcement based on quote, ""racial bias."" How exactly do you think that law will be applied? You don't have to wonder. Call the police because you're frightened of mostly peaceful protesters threatening to kill you? You're the criminal now.
And day by day, liberalism evaporates and the left's troops who call themselves liberals, children of the enlightenment are falling in line behind what is clearly a power grip.
Just today, the founder of vox.com, Ezra Klein, someone regarded as an intellectual on the left, went on Twitter to explain why free speech is actually very bad. Quote, ""A lot of debates that sell themselves as being about free speech are actually about power, and there's a lot of power in being able to claim and hold the mantle of free speech defender.""
Oh, we see where you're going. Actually, Ezra Klein is half right about this. Free speech definitely is about power. Power for people who don't have any. People like Ezra Klein want less free speech for others so they can have more power.
When they can tell you what you can say, what they're really telling you is what you're allowed to believe. They're not controlling your mouth, they are controlling your mind and there's no deeper control than that.
Any person who is telling you that is someone you should be very afraid of.
Saagar Enjeti is the chief Washington correspondent for ""The Hill,"" and we're happy to have him on tonight. So Saagar, you came up in journalism. You exist in the journalistic spheres such as it is, I guess now, are you surprised by how little debate remains? Legitimate exchanges, civil exchanges of different views.
SAAGAR ENJETI, CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, ""THE HILL"": No, Tucker, I'm not because the ground for this has been laid for quite some time. As you pointed out, the culture wars, everybody said what was going on these American campuses was just ludicrous for the right to focus on.
Well, many of those people grew up and they graduated, and now they work at vox.com. Now, they work at ""The New York Times."" Now they work in the most storied and most important elite institutions in the country. Many of them work on the Biden campaign, as you rightfully pointed out.
We should have absolutely no illusions that whenever these people come to power, especially with somebody like Joe Biden at the helm, who barely understands what is going on, his Department of Justice, his government, and any of the powers that are invested in the highest institutions, will be used expressly to put out any dissent whatsoever.
It is all a crescendo to that moment. It is all driven by the idea that we must not engage, we must deplatform, we must remove -- we must express move away from anybody who holds a different view.
Just remember that ""The New York Times"" fired its top editor for publishing an op-ed by Senator Tom Cotton, who was espousing a position which at the time it was published was supported by 58 percent of Americans and that is using the United States military to restore order in American streets.
If they can shut down majoritarian positions in those institutions, that's what they're going to do whenever they come to power in this country.
CARLSON: What's so striking is the ferocity of their passive aggression. So, I express strong opinions on the show. People don't like them, they criticize me. It never hurts my feelings. It's totally fair. I criticize others, you can criticize me back.
They consistently set themselves up, so they're immune from criticism. You can't criticize me because I'm this person or I did that. I'm immune from critique. How did they get away with that?
ENJETI: It's kind of incredible, right? There'll be like, you're a disgusting, virulent, racist, anti-Semite. And I'll be like, well, well hold on a second here, and they're like, he is harassing me. He is harassing me by responding to me.
And I'm like, but you just called me a disgusting, virulent, racist, and that's the worst possible thing that you can say about somebody in American society. Rightfully so. I think being a racist is a terrible thing.
Are you a racist because you want to have less immigration to the United States and less competition for American wages? But they control speech. They control the rules of the debate. And when they can do that, they can make it so that even the act of defense is an act of so-called offense against them.
It's just complete madness.
CARLSON: Well, you know, I hate to blame the victims in all of this because the victims are people I know and love. It's normal people.
But we are kind of participating in our own oppression a little bit, aren't we? I mean, if they say no, you can't say that. Why don't we just hoist the middle finger and laugh? Why are we playing along with this?
Most people aren't racist. Most Americans are very decent, good hearted people, obviously. So, why are we allowing them to control us?
ENJETI: It's a great question, Tucker, and it's one that was probably directed to the Republican leadership because unlike the Democratic leadership, they have no idea how to actually use power and actually defend and protect their constituents and the people that brought them to power.
They think that by appeasing the Democrats or the left or in any of these cases that they're like, oh, well, they'll just love us if we give them this particular thing, but it's the light version of woke. That is never enough for them. That is at the very core ethos of this ideology.
CARLSON: Yes, it doesn't work in prison and it doesn't work in politics. You give in a little -- I'm serious -- don't ever give in. Saagar Enjeti, great to see you tonight. Thank you for your wisdom.
ENJETI: Thank you, Tucker.
CARLSON: Ghislaine Maxwell and we've searched far and wide for the correct pronunciation -- not that we care that much -- but anyway, Ghislaine Maxwell is in jail, and probably about to face justice for her role in assisting Jeffrey Epstein. But will she?
A former New York corrections official says there is a real risk that she will not make it to a courtroom. He joins us next.
CARLSON: Jeffrey Epstein's consigliere, reputedly his pimp, has been arrested and charged with a number of crimes including sex trafficking. Her name apparently is pronounced Ghislaine Maxwell -- spelled Ghislaine.
You know who she is. According to one of Epstein's victims who spoke with Fox, Maxwell is just as bad as the billionaire she once served.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She is a rapist. She destroyed my -- what was supposed to be the best years of my life.
She is just as evil as Jeffrey Epstein as everybody has painted him to be.
Miss Maxwell was his business partner in this. She -- she did this to many girls.
It was a hateful and degrading rape and I was dumped off in my grandparents' yard naked and was told that I wouldn't come back alive the next time.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: Another alleged victim told ""60 Minutes Australia,"" which is excellent by the way, about how Maxwell ensnared young girls.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: His private sanctuary, an isolated prison known as Pedo Island, where he would share the girls like prey with his rich and powerful friends.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We weren't anything important to them at all. We weren't even a human being to them. We were just another toy to be passed around. And that's what they did.
Prince Andrew should be panicking at the moment because Ghislaine doesn't really care about anyone else but Ghislaine.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I was in the car with her, and she would ask the driver to stop the car, and she'd dash across to the school or the park, or wherever she was going and she would like write down her phone number for a child, a young girl, and then I'd see that child at the house, and she'd say they're auditioning. You know, I found a model in the park.
And I thought it was really strange because I did see a couple of girls in braces and I've never seen a model with braces.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: Well, that's disgusting. So Maxwell has now been arrested. But then of course, Jeffrey Epstein was arrested, too. So how confident can the rest of us be that Maxwell will reveal what actually happened on Pedo Island and other places. Who was involved? Who paid for it? Were there foreign governments? How confident can we be that she will make it to a courtroom?
Ed Gavin is retired Deputy Warden for the New York City Department of Correction, the man to answer that question. He joins us tonight. Ed, thanks so much for coming on. Are you concerned that Maxwell won't make it to court?
ED GAVIN, RETIRED DEPUTY WARDEN, NEW YORK CITY DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTION: I think there are some issues that we have to contend with. When you think about what happened to Jeffrey Epstein, he supposedly committed suicide in prison. I don't think so.
Dr. Michael Baden, a renowned pathologist examined Jeffrey Epstein and he determined that the hyoid bone was fractured and that's more consistent with homicide by strangulation instead of suicide by hanging. And of course, the cameras conveniently weren't working there.
I don't think the Feds can handle these prisoners, such high profile prisoners like Maxwell or Epstein.
If I were William Barr, what I would do is I would seek to obtain a substitute jail order and I would try to have Miss Maxwell placed on Rikers Island with the New York City Department of Correction.
I mean, the jails are empty right now because de Blasio has police reform and Cuomo has bail reform. So everybody is out in the streets. So there's plenty of room at the end on Rikers, and then we have an Emergency Services Unit that could handle her. And I think that's the best thing that could happen.
And the reason I say that is because the jail that she is currently in, the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn is notorious for the sexual abuse of female inmates.
Let me give you a couple of examples. In 2011, there was a female correctional officer there. She had sex on duty with eight employees. Two of them were superior officers. She also had sex with two inmates, one was a gangbanger and a drug dealer, and the other one killed two New York City police detectives.
And finally, we have a lieutenant and two correctional officers recently who were convicted of, you know, sexually abusing over 10 women. The lieutenant was in charge of the unit and he was -- one of his functions was to teach the officers about PREA, which is the Prison Rape Elimination Act.
Can you imagine the guy that's supposed to be training officers how to prevent rape in prisons is actually raping the inmates? So I don't think that that facility is capable of handling it. There's just too much that's gone on there recently, and I don't think any female inmate should be housed there.
And another thing I firmly believe, I don't believe female inmates should be housed in the same facility with male inmates. It just doesn't make any sense. We need to change that.
CARLSON: Well, obviously, right. Unless you believe there's no difference between the sexes, in which case, you're a moron.
Here's what bothers me. I don't think anybody mourns the death of Jeffrey Epstein as a man. But what does this say about the country when a guy can be possibly murdered in a jail cell? It suggests that a lot of people played along with that, the people who are supposed to be watching him, perhaps officials at the facility. Why are none of them in deep trouble right now? Why don't we know the truth? I don't understand.
GAVIN: Well, I'll tell you why because we have corrupt police officials. We have corrupt officials in the F.B.I. We have corrupt officials in the U.S. Attorney's Office.
I mean, just look at what Jeffrey Epstein did going back 10 to 15 years ago. He paid money to the Palm Beach Police Department. Police departments shouldn't be accepting money from private citizens.
What sex offender -- what sex offender gets work release from jail? The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office has facilitated that. Epstein formed a company so that you could pay Deputy Sheriffs to babysit him while he was on work release.
Now I was a Deputy Warden for Security and Programs at a New York City Correctional Facility in 2000 and we housed about 400 sex offenders. I never had one sex offender that was released on work release. It's unheard of.
So then you had the State's Attorney way back when who didn't even bother to interview the children or their parents. Now as you know, Tucker now, I've been doing human trafficking investigations for the last 14 years in the streets in New York, so I know a lot about that.
And Child Protective Services was never notified. The Family Court was never notified. And Social Services never had an opportunity to protect those children.
So law enforcement has blown this from the very beginning, and now all of a sudden, 10 years later, they arrest Jeffrey Epstein at an airport?
CARLSON: Exactly.
GAVIN: Now all of a sudden, they find this clown up in New Hampshire? Give me a break.
CARLSON: I totally agree.
GAVIN: The law enforcement authorities that have handled this is -- it's just bizarre. I've never heard of anything like it. I do not trust the people that were involved in this investigation.
CARLSON: Right. So, instead they are pressing local police departments, but nobody is saying this. No, I agree. Give me your 10 seconds.
GAVIN: Not these police departments.
CARLSON: Exactly. Ed, thank you for that. Thanks for coming on tonight. You spun me up.
GAVIN: They blew it.
CARLSON: Appreciate it.
GAVIN: Thanks.
CARLSON: They certainly did. Well, killings have more than doubled in New York City compared to this time a year ago. In 2013, CNN's Don Lemon seemed to care about that. Today's Don Lemon thinks it's hilarious that children are being killed. We've got the video which is actually going to shock you. We never make that promise. We're going to fulfill this one.
One reason the actual Black Lives organization doesn't care about urban mayhem is the group is directly linked to a convicted domestic terrorist. You probably haven't seen this story. We'll bring it to you next.
CARLSON: If you don't have much money, and if you don't have much power, this is definitely a very bad time to live in New York City. It's a frightening time.
The economy has been shut down for months, hundreds of thousands of jobs have vanished -- they may not come back. The neighborhoods of New York have been scarred by rioting and looting.
And now, most ominously, violence is surging in what used to be not so long ago America's safest big city.
Shootings this June more than doubled compared to the same month last year. On Sunday alone, 64 people in New York were shot, 10 were killed.
It's obvious what's going on here. New York's leaders are indulging the mob, which works for them in the end. They're attacking police officers. They are holding back law enforcement for normal people.
Criminals and predators are doing what they always do. They're taking advantage. Weak and vulnerable people of all races are paying the price for this.
This is not a concern over at CNN, Don Lemon doesn't care. He is a highly paid news anchor. For him, the shootings and murders are the stuff he covers on television, not something that affects his life. In fact, the whole thing is kind of hilarious. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: Yes, Democratic cities are in chaos right now. Is this what you want from Joe Biden? And they're going to take your country away and they're taking down the statues and --
CHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR: Crime is rising.
LEMON: Crime is rising.
CUOMO: Defund police.
LEMON: Oh my gosh, it's so bad and they've got defunding police -- it's like. Whew.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: Wow. Talk about caught telling the truth on camera and it wasn't the only time he did. On Tuesday, Lemon invited actor, Terry Crews on his show, and explained correctly that despite its name, Black Lives Matter, it doesn't really care about black lives.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TERRY CREWS, ACTOR: You look in the City of Chicago, they had nine children who died by gun violence by black on black gun violence from June 20th all the way to today.
The Black Lives Matter movement has said nothing about that kind of thing.
LEMON: What does have to do with the quality though, Terry? The Black Lives Matter movement was started because it was talking about police brutality. If you want an all Black Lives Matter movement that talks about gun violence in communities, including, you know, black communities, then start that movement with that name.
But that's not what Black Lives Matter is about. The Black Lives Matter movement is about police brutality and injustice in that manner, not about what's happening in black neighborhoods.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: Now, if you're running a channel like CNN, you want dumb people on TV because they're compliant. They'll say what they're told. They'll tell the audience what the moment demands. They will never stray from the script, and that's exactly what Mr. Lemon is doing.
But just seven years ago, it was a different country and people were kind of allowed to say what they thought was true. And so at the time, here's what Don Lemon was saying about black communities. Watch this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
LEMON: More than 72 percent of children in the African-American community are born out of wedlock. That means absent fathers, and the studies show that lack of a male role model is an express train right to prison. And the cycle continues.
So please, black folks, as I said, if this doesn't apply to you, I'm not talking to you, pay attention to and think about what has been presented in recent history as acceptable behavior.
Pay close attention to the hip hop and rap culture that many of you embrace, a culture that glorifies everything I just mentioned, thug and reprehensible behavior, a culture that is making a lot of people rich, just not you, and it's not going to.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: Wow. Can you imagine what would happen if Don Lemon or his bodybuilding buddy over there or any of these hair hats said something like that On CNN tonight or MSNBC? That would be their last live broadcast ever. They'd be fired immediately. You can't express views like that. And so they don't. Tells you a lot.
Well, despite its immense political power, and it does have immense power, the group Black Lives Matter isn't really much of a group. It's a relatively small, flimsy organization. In fact, it doesn't really have a legal existence of its own.
Officially, the primary Black Lives Matter group is simply a project of another nonprofit called Thousand Currents. Now, why is this interesting? Well, it's interesting because the current Vice Chair of Thousand Currents is a woman called Susan Rosenberg and she is a convicted terrorist who spent 16 years in Federal prison before she was given a pardon by Bill Clinton on the very last day in office.
Bernie Kerik remembers this well. He is the former Police Commissioner of New York City. But before that, he worked in New Jersey and he personally escorted Susan Rosenberg from the Federal courthouse in Newark in 1985. He knows the story and we're happy to have him on tonight.
Mr. Kerik, thank you for coming on. The picture is remarkable.
BERNARD KERIK, FORMER NEW YORK POLICE COMMISSIONER: Thanks.
CARLSON: So Susan Rosenberg --
KERIK: I had hair then, Tucker. I had hair.
CARLSON: And an AR-15. So what -- who is Susan Rosenberg? Why is it significant that she now in effect works for Black Lives Matter?
KERIK: Well, for me, on a personal note, it's important for your viewers to know who she is because Black Lives Matter, as I've said, dating back to 2015 is a Revolutionary Marxist group. That's what it is.
It's a group that wants to overthrow this government, the country. It's a group that its founders -- its three founders were inspired by a woman named Joanne Chesimard, who goes by an African name, Assata Shakur, who lives in exile in Cuba after she assassinated a New Jersey State Trooper.
She was involved in a number of bombings and executions of New York City cops, cops in San Francisco and cops in New Jersey. That's who they are. That's what they're about.
And when I tried to explain that to people over the last two or three years, they didn't get it. Now, in the last few weeks, we learn Susan Rosenberg is one of their fundraising gurus, let's say.
Well, Susan Rosenberg in 1985, when you look at that photo, she was convicted of possessing hundreds of pounds of explosives. She was involved in the Bronx Nyack robbery where two cops were killed and a security guard was killed.
She was involved -- her and her organization, the May 19th Communist Organization, they were involved in a number of police assassinations, bombings, the U.S. Capitol bombing, the Naval War College bombing, and a number of others in the United States.
She was a radical revolutionary and she was let out of prison. She was commuted on the last day of President Clinton's term in office after 16 years of prison. She was given 58 years in prison.
And now, she is out. Who does she work for? Black Lives Matter. I think -- I think you know, we're missing something here. I think D.O.J. should be looking at Black Lives Matter as a terrorist group, as a terrorist organization, and I think -- I find it astounding that all these U.S. firms, some 200 that you've chronicled on your show, they're just pounding money into a group that's all about the overthrow of this government.
And if you can't see it on its face by what they do normally on a daily basis, then you need to start looking at their associates, their inspirers and the people around them because this stuff has been going on since 1960, 1970 and in the early 80s when these people, these revolutionaries, Marxist revolutionaries wanted to overthrow this country.
CARLSON: It's just amazing that all the rich ladies in Aspen and Greenwich think BLM is about ending racism, which obviously all of us are for, when in fact it's a revolutionary group. Maybe the U.S. government could take decisive action and by doing that, make it really clear that this is a terror organization.
KERIK: You know what, Tucker, if Black Lives Matter was truly, you know, working for black lives, they would be more interested tonight in Chicago or Baltimore or in Cleveland, or I can give you 20 other cities. It's all nonsense.
CARLSON: No, I know. It is and it's having the opposite effect. Needless to say. Bernie Kerik, thanks so much for that. Great to see you tonight.
KERIK: Thanks, Tucker.
CARLSON: Well, the science is absolutely clear and it's not disputed, American schools should reopen this fall. They're reopening in Europe for a reason. We told you last night.
And now, we have an unexpected ally in that. We will tell you who agrees, next.
CARLSON: Last night on this show, we told you what the science has concluded about schools and COVID-19. Children -- and this is conclusive -- are less likely to get the virus, unlikely to spread it and in the end, virtually zero risk from it. They are far at greater risk from the annual flu, four times as many kids have died of that this season than died of the coronavirus.
Many countries have reopened their schools for this reason without masks or other requirements and there has been no spike in cases. So the evidence is overwhelming, schools should reopen in person this fall.
While covering coronavirus, we've had plenty of criticism of Dr. Anthony Fauci, but when he spoke with our Dr. Marc Siegel on SiriusXM Radio about schools. He got this response.
(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)
DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: If you keep children out of school, the unintended negative ripple effect consequences can be profound with regard to what do the parents do? You know what -- they then stay off of work to be able to take care of their children? What about child care?
And what about children who rely on schools for their lunch? For maybe the most important nutritional meal that they'll get?
So the broad approach would be, obviously, but paying attention to the safety of the children, which is always paramount, but within the context of doing whatever you can to safeguard the health and the welfare of the children. We should try to get the schools open.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: Yes, and what about each other? People need each other, children included. It's not good for people to be alone.
Dr. Marc Siegel, who did that interview joins us tonight. Hey, Doctor.
DR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Tucker, I was so glad to see Dr. Fauci finally taking that position. When you consider the position that we need to take is, we're opening the schools. How do we go about doing it? What guidelines can help us? Not the guidelines getting in the way of it and so the Centers for Disease Control are reissuing guidelines next week that may be more personal, maybe they will actually work.
I'm reminded of a child named Landon Fuller, Tucker, 11 years old. I saw his picture on the front of ""The Albuquerque Journal"" this past weekend, back at the end of April. He was in such a state of despair from the closed schools, from the closed state of New Mexico that he took his own life. It wasn't COVID-19. He took his own life.
And we need to remember Landon Fuller as we move forward, because as Vice President Pence said today, there's a lot of damage if we don't reopen the schools and reopen them fully.
We have special needs children that only get their needs taken care of at schools. We have nutritional issues. Some people only get their full meal at school. Socialization. Kids playing together. And mental health issues, as the Vice President says, often only at schools and I want to tell you as a physician who is now back taking care of patients, I didn't feel whole before, and I bet if you survey teachers, they would tell you the same thing.
They want to be back in school. They want to be taking care of kids, and so we can test them, and Dr. Fauci told me today that the antigen testing is about to be rolled out, Tucker, that we can test millions and millions of people and universities we talked about, he actually agreed with me on that as well, that universities definitely should be fully reopened because you can quarantine. They are a quarantine waiting to happen.
If someone gets sick, you isolate them. You test professors. You can test students, but don't do it the way Harvard is with online only or the way my Alma Mater, Brown is doing it with three sessions. Do it the way Duke is doing it or Notre Dame is doing it or Cornell is doing it.
Everybody back in full force, Tucker.
Tucker in the State of New Mexico, which I started off with here, 20 percent increase -- 20 percent increase in unexpected deaths since this pandemic started. Unexpected deaths -- that's suicide, homicide and car accidents and that's not just in New Mexico. That's all over the country and our own poor Landon Fuller who I started with here, 11 years old is gone.
Our heart goes out to his family. Let's reopen the schools in his memory. Let's bring the soul back, the heart back to our country in our schools, Tucker, the heart of our country.
CARLSON: Amen. We should care. You obviously do. Dr. Siegel, thank you so much.
SIEGEL: Thanks, Tucker.
CARLSON: Roger Stone is about to go to prison essentially for the rest of his life, but his enemies aren't satisfied with that. They need to humiliate him on the way out, so they're kicking Roger Stone off the internet. That's next.
Plus, Dana Perino here to tell us how Joe Biden will escape the debates this fall if indeed -- she thinks he will. That's next.
CARLSON: Roger Stone has been ordered to report to prison next week for the crime of being unpopular with the people in charge. Once he is behind bars, he will be a threat to no one. In fact, he's never been a threat to anyone. He's going to prison because of his politics, not because of anything he did.
But even spending years in prison, his last years, isn't enough for the people sending him, they want him destroyed in every way and humiliated on the way out.
That's why they sent the F.B.I. in a brigade size unit to his house to arrest him at gunpoint and then invited CNN to chronicle the whole thing.
It's why today Facebook announced it is deleting Roger Stone's personal Facebook account and banning him from the platform. So his alleged crime is a connection to something called misinformation -- whatever that is. It is about as valid as the crime Stone is going to prison for.
It is all an excuse, of course. His real offense was supporting the wrong presidential candidate. And on top of that, and this really is the core of it, mocking the people in charge. They hate that more than anything, and so they're destroying Roger Stone and they're getting away with it, as they always do.
Well, we told you at the top of the show that Tom Friedman of ""The New York Times"" does not want Joe Biden to debate. He is saying that because many Democrats are saying it privately. Biden is ahead. There's no reason to risk it by talking.
So can Biden get away with that? This is part of an ongoing conversation that we have had with our friend, Dana Perino, who as you well know hosts ""The Daily Briefing"" and joins us again tonight.
So Dana, thank you for coming on. Couldn't resist bringing you back.
DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: You bet.
CARLSON: You're usually right when we have a dispute, but in this case, I said there is no chance Joe Biden is going to debate Donald Trump and you said that's such an offense against precedent that he must. And my contention, I'll leave it -- I'll leave it with you after this is that Tom Friedman's column today is the opening of a series of columns like that that will convince the Biden people they don't have to debate.
PERINO: I will say, Tucker, that you and Tom Friedman being in agreement was a plot twist I did not expect in 2020. I think that Tom Friedman has -- I mean, am I wrong, Tucker, that Tom Friedman is considered the person who has been most consistently wrong in Washington, D.C. over his entire career?
CARLSON: Probably ever.
PERINO: I think I am right.
CARLSON: Yes, and probably in history.
PERINO: Okay, okay. But I do think that part of this is that yes, I think that party elders are maybe concerned that Joe Biden could blow it. But that's exactly why I think he has to debate because the questions about his mental acuity and his capabilities, his faculties, if he doesn't debate, all of those would definitely be on the table.
And I think that he has to step up when he owes it to the voters to give us a debate so that we can see. But also, I think that he has to prove that the President is wrong when the President says that he has lost a step. He has dementia, whatever it is. He is sleepy. I think the debates are the way to do that.
CARLSON: But isn't that already up for debate now? In other words, Biden is hiding. He says it's because of the coronavirus. Trump is essentially the same age as Biden. Biden is pretty physically fit. Biden is staying at home. Trump is everywhere.
So Biden is already basically conceding that he does not want to answer unscripted questions, and he is still ahead. So why would they change that formula?
PERINO: Yes, I mean, it's a good point. I can see the strategy. I just don't think that it will work. One, I do think that the race is tighter than it appears on paper right now.
CARLSON: Yes, I agree with that.
PERINO: And regardless, I do know that it will tighten even further. This is not going to be a landslide in either way, like this is going to be a close election.
And here's the other thing that Tom Friedman is using this column of his to talk about Donald Trump's tax returns. What he said is that Joe Biden should not debate and or he should say, I will not debate you unless you release your tax returns in 2016 and 2018. And that that would be the reason, but that that might draw President Trump out and get the tax returns.
One, I don't think that's going to happen. I think that's been very much litigated. But what happens tomorrow morning, Tucker? You have the Supreme Court finally going to decide on this question on whether the President's tax -- the President can be compelled or to release his tax returns. We'll know at 10:00 a.m.
I think that that was what Tom Friedman was trying to get at, in addition to hoping that Joe Biden could just skate by, win election without having to debate. I just still don't think that's possible.
CARLSON: Can I give you my theory of the case? My theory is that you are such a good person and you believe so fervently in our system, and that's a compliment because I do, too, that it's too offensive to you personally to think that anybody of either party could ever be elected President without standing in a Presidential Debate Hall, that you just won't allow that that could happen.
PERINO: And don't you think there are enough Americans that think like we do? That that would be so offensive? That it would be definitely a reason not to vote for that person if they skipped a debate?
CARLSON: Yes. I mean, I fervently hope so and maybe I'm getting too cynical as I get as old as I'm becoming. But I'm starting to think -- I mean, if you won't even take questions, if you say that certain questions are out of bounds by their nature, you're a public servant, you have to answer all questions, right? It's our government, and you'd get away with it -- maybe --
PERINO: Tucker, I have to tell you. This morning when I woke up and I started reading the news, and I saw that column, the first thing I thought was, Tucker, is going to crush me on this tonight because it's exactly what you brought up last week, but I'm going to maintain that Biden will debate and if I'm wrong, I will let you off on the other bet that you owe me.
CARLSON: Well, by the way, if you're right, I will be thrilled. I really will. Dana Perino, great to see you, weekdays 2:00 p.m. Thanks very much.
PERINO: Thank you.
CARLSON: We are out of time. We hope you have the best evening. Shelter from the ongoing storm in your home with the ones you love. The Great Sean Hannity is right now."

Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) News Release",FALSE,"Washington, D.C. - Today, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) delivered the following statement, as prepared, on the House floor in support of H.Res. 908, Condemning all forms of anti-Asian sentiment as related to COVID-19:
""Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 908, a resolution condemning all forms of anti-Asian sentiment as related to COVID-19.
""Among other things, the resolution, introduced by my colleague from New York, Representative Grace Meng, calls upon all public officials to condemn and denounce anti-Asian sentiment, and it calls on Federal law enforcement officials to investigate and document all credible reports of hate crimes against Asian-Americans, to collect data on the rise of hate crimes incidents due to COVID-19, and to hold perpetrators accountable.
""The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing crisis for our country. Over 6.6 million Americans have been infected, and almost 200,000 have died from COVID-19. It has upended the lives of almost every American in some way and it will continue to do so for some time as we brace for a potential second wave of infections.
""On top of bearing the burdens that the pandemic has imposed on all Americans, Asian-Americans have been forced to carry the added anxiety of confronting racial prejudice, including racially-motivated harassment and violence, stemming from a stigma that has unfairly associated them with COVID-19 because of the virus's origins in China, a stigma that has been reinforced by rhetoric suggesting such a link.
""According to the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, since March 19, there have been almost 2,600 cases of anti-Asian discrimination related to COVID-19. According to the resolution, at the pandemic's earliest stage in this country, between February 9 and March 7, there were over 400 such incidents.
""These include the stabbings of an Asian-American father and his two young children, ages 2 and 6, in Texas.
""Public health entities including the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have recognized that labeling a virus by geographic or ethnic terms unfairly stigmatizes certain communities and ultimately harms public health. For this reason, Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar rightly condemned the use of the phrase 'Chinese virus' in testimony before the Ways and Means Committee, stating that 'ethnicity is not what causes the novel coronavirus.'
""It is incumbent on all public figures, including elected officials like us, to publicly condemn bigotry and the stigmatization of racial or ethnic groups unfairly targeted for blame. We must speak out clearly against such attitudes and acts of hate whenever they occur, but particularly in the face of public panic or fear during a national emergency, when society can be especially vulnerable to racist appeals and prejudices.
""While many public figures have admirably sought to end COVID-19-related racial animosity, some, unfortunately, appear not to share the same sense of moral duty. Rather than using their bully pulpits to confront prejudice and racial hatred, they have, instead, chosen repeatedly to use derogatory and prejudicial phrases and remarks reinforcing the exclusion and stigmatization of Asian-Americans in the face of a national crisis--a tactic that, sadly, has a long and ugly history in our country. Left unchecked, this type of rhetoric has, in the past, led to grave injustices like the Chinese Exclusion Act and the internment of Japanese-Americans during the Second World War.
""In the year 2020, condemning bigotry and racial scapegoating should not be hard for any Member of this House to do. It is long past time to leave the days of 'yellow peril' hysteria and unjustified blame of the ""other"" behind. The House can take an important step in that direction by passing H. Res. 908 unanimously. I urge you strongly to support this resolution.
""I reserve the balance of my time.""

Driving an Audi convertible on August 24, Charles Streep, 31, allegedly blew a stop sign and almost hit David Peralta, 18, who was in a red Ford Mustang in downtown East Hampton, Peralta's lawyer Edmond Chakmakian told the New York Post on Wednesday.
""The privileged individual that he is, he blew the stop sign like it wasn't there, came narrowly close to my client's car,"" Chakmakian said of Charles Streep. 
""He yells at my client and David said, 'Hey, you had the stop sign. You're in the wrong.'""
According to Chakmakian, Charles Streep made an illegal U-turn and trailed Peralta and his girlfriend who was also in the car, to a Chase bank parking lot. 
Charles Streep pulled Peralta's door open and ""said something to the effect of, 'What are you, 14 years old?'"" Chakmakian said. 
The older man lodged several racial slurs against Peralta, who was born in the U.S. and is of Ecuadorian descent, Chakmakian said. 
Then, Charles Streep body-slammed Peralta and caused him to hit his head on the ground, according to court papers obtained by the Post.
""The defendant's conduct was intentional, malicious and racially motivated, as evidenced by the defendant spewing racial slurs during the attack,"" states the lawsuit filed on Wednesday.
Chakmakian claims that his client became unconscious, but Charles Streep still lifted his body and slammed it on the ground in ""an absolute obscene display of anger and violence.""
Charles Streep faces felony charges of assault and strangulation. 
The lawsuit seeks punitive damages and was filed in Manhattan Supreme Court.
Peralta's lawyer is also petitioning the Suffolk County district attorney to file upgraded hate crime charges against the 31-year-old. 
Charles Streep's father, Dana, is the brother of Academy Award-winning actress Meryl Streep. 
Peralta refused medical attention after the beatdown, but soon after getting home, he was airlifted to Stony Brook University Hospital for an emergency surgery to ease pressure on his brain. 
The surgery involved removing his skullcap, and photos emerged of him in a hospital bed with stitches along his head. 
""If he was there 20 minutes later, he would not have made it or he would've been left in a vegetative state,"" Chakmakian said.
The John Jay College student was heading into his sophomore year and worked as a server at DOPO La Spiaggia Hamptons. 
Peralta now faces more than $80,000 in medical bills, cognitive and physical therapy, according to his attorney.
""He's never going to be the same. He's lucky if he finishes college,"" Chakmakian said. "

Holden Matthews was also ordered to pay more than 2.66 million dollars in restitution for the arson rampage, which unfolded over the course of 10 days in March and April 2019.
St Mary Baptist Church in Port Barre [north of Lafayette] is slated to receive 590,246 dollars of the funds while Greater Union in Opelousas [also north of Lafayette] was allotted 970,213.30 dollars, the Department of Justice said in a press release.
Matthews is additionally required to pay Mt Pleasant, also in Opelousas, 1.1 million dollars.
All three churches were destroyed in the fires.
Matthews in February pleaded guilty to three counts of using fire to commit a felony and three counts of intentional damage to religious property, which are labeled hate crimes by the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996. The 23-year-old had been facing 70 years behind bars.
Federal prosecutors said he admitted to setting the fires because of ""the religious characters of the buildings"" and in a bid to raise his profile as a ""'black metal' musician."" He told authorities at the time he was inspired by similar crimes committed in Norway in the 1990s.
""These churches trace their origins to the post-Civil War Reconstruction period and, for generations, were a place for predominantly African American Christians to gather, pray, worship and celebrate their faith,"" Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband of the Civil Rights Division said.

Anti-gun violence organizations are expecting presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden to highlight the issue during his acceptance speech Thursday.
""What we always expect from him on our issue is just really strong and thoughtful leadership. He knows our organization well. He's been working with us for over 30 years,"" said Brady PAC Executive Director Brian Lemek.
Brady PAC, the sister organization of the nation's oldest anti-gun violence advocacy group, touted that Biden helped pass the Brady Bill in 1993, which implemented the modern background check system that advocates are now pushing to reform.
Biden also delivered a eulogy in 2014 for James Brady, former President Reagan's press secretary who was paralyzed by an assassination attempt on the president.
Brady PAC, formed during the 2018 election cycle, has raised nearly $100,000 for the Biden campaign, with a goal of hitting $250,000. The PAC, which endorsed Biden in March, has also given nearly $1 million to House and Senate races this cycle.
Everytown for Gun Safety, which has also contributed significantly to Biden's campaign after not making any direct campaign contributions in 2016, is hoping for more than just a mention of gun control during the former vice president's prime-time speech.
""Given his decades-long leadership on gun safety, we wouldn't be surprised if Joe Biden made this issue a key part of his convention message. And we can be absolutely certain that Biden, who has pledged to take action on gun safety in his first 100 days of office and committed $900 million in local violence intervention programs, will be the strongest gun sense president we've ever seen,"" said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety.
Biden's plan includes spending $900 million to help cities combat gun violence, strengthen laws to protect women and prevent domestic violence, and curtail harassment online that could lead to gun violence.
The virtual convention comes on the heels of a lawsuit filed by New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) seeking to dissolve the NRA, alleging that the organization violated state law governing nonprofits.
The suit accuses four top NRA officials, including CEO Wayne LaPierre, of diverting millions of dollars away from its charitable mission.
Gun safety advocates are hoping the lawsuit will force the NRA to spend its resources on litigation instead of 2020 campaigns.
Feinblatt said that rather than buying political ads, ""they're going to be paying legal bills.""
The NRA spent $36 million backing President Trump in the 2016 cycle.
Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund and Victory Fund plans to spend $60 million on elections during the 2020 cycle.
The group ¯ co-founded by billionaire and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg (D), who launched a short-lived 2020 presidential campaign ¯ did not make a direct campaign contribution to 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton or any other candidate that cycle.
The 2020 Democratic platform calls for ending the epidemic of gun violence, which the party refers to as a public health crisis. It also calls for universal background checks, an end to online sales of guns and ammunition, and closing loopholes that allow individuals convicted of hate crimes to buy firearms.
Gun deaths, as well as mass shootings, increased last year compared to 2018, according to figures compiled by the Gun Violence Archive.
Giffords, the group formed by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.), has given only $10,000 to the Biden Victory Fund. The organization is mostly focused on flipping the Senate and it has given nearly $200,000 for federal races. Gabrielle Giffords endorsed Biden in March, and her husband is seeking the Senate seat in Arizona held by Sen. Martha McSally (R).
""We fully expect Vice President Biden to issue a rallying cry that we must do more to save lives,"" said Robin Lloyd, managing director for Giffords.
""Vice President Biden is a bold leader with a clear and robust gun violence prevention platform that shows his commitment to taking action from the day he steps in the White House,"" Lloyd added.
In 2016, when Giffords was known as the Americans for Responsible Solutions PAC, made in-kind contributions to Clinton but no outright donations.
Biden's plan includes banning the manufacturing and sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, regulating possession of existing assault weapons, and holding gun manufacturers accountable by repealing protections that they cannot be held civilly liable for their products.
It also includes buying back assault weapons and high-capacity magazines that are already in the community, reducing stockpiling of firearms and enacting universal background check legislation.
On the issue of background checks, he would require one for all gun sales, close loopholes to the system, keep guns out of the hands of people with mental health issues and close the so-called Charleston loophole, among other things.
The House passed the Bipartisan Background Checks Act, aimed at strengthening background checks for gun purchases, in 2019. A day later, the House approved the Enhanced Background Checks Act, which would close the Charleston loophole and give federal investigators more time to do background checks. Neither bill has been taken up by the GOP-controlled Senate.
Lemek said Biden's gun control plan is ""probably the most comprehensive in American history for our issue.""
""He knows it's a complex problem, he knows it requires comprehensive solutions,"" Lemek said."

154,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_751/Files (250).DOCX","The Sydney Morning Herald (Australia) - Online",2020-11-26,"774 words",NA,"Julie Power",NA,"Brutal but beautiful: Stokes' list of Sydney's architectural gems",FALSE,"Far from agreeing that the Brutalist style Sirius building should be slated for the wrecking ball as Treasurer Dominic Perrottet suggested this week, NSW Planning Minister Rob Stokes has put the love-it or hate-it apartment block on his competing list of 10 hidden architectural gems in Sydney.
Explaining his list, Mr Stokes said, ""One of the beautiful things about Sydney is that it isn't consistent and there's a contradiction of styles.""
His list reflects that. The oldest is The Mint on Macquarie Street, a former hospital funded by rum sales. It was known as the Sydney slaughterhouse because so many died from dysentery there. Mr Stokes admires the wide verandahs of the 1816 building as a major Australian contribution to international architecture.
It also includes Elizabeth Bay House, called the finest home in the colony after the house and grotto were finished in 1839.
He moves on to John James' 1968 Reader's Digest Building in Surry Hills built on the site of the Tooheys' stables, and then Bungan Castle, a Northern Beaches home that once hosted artist Norman Lindsay.
Stokes' list also includes the 2018 award-winning Punchbowl Mosque, described as architect Angelo Candalepas' ""modern masterpiece"" and features more than 100 domes.
Mr Perrottet's mischievous suggestion of taking a wrecking ball to iconic buildings like the MLC Centre, which he described as a hate crime, and Greenway Apartments, may be counterproductive.
According to NSW's state architect Abbie Galvin, ""awesome"" public debates like these have actually saved buildings from destruction.
The most recent example was the Sirius. Other examples included the Finger Wharves, the State Theatre and public housing in Woolloomooloo. The Queen Victoria Building, now much loved, was described as a ""monstrosity"" in the late 1950s. Sydney's then Lord Mayor Harry Jensen had wanted to turn the location into a public park. Much of Paddington and McMahons Point's terraces would be history if it weren't for public debate.
Far from thinking the Treasurer should keep his nose out of architecture, Ms Galvin said ""we should be thanking"" him for encouraging public debate.
""Design is everyone's business,"" she said. Yet making decisions about what to save and what to keep should be more than about aesthetics, she said.
Ms Galvin agreed with Mr Stokes' view of the Cahill Expressway. ""We shouldn't just continue to hate it. We ultimately need a better vision of the Circular Quay and the harbour,"" Ms Galvin said.
Many architects challenged Mr Perrottet to ""put his money where his mouth is"" and fund the removal of the Cahill Expressway, long considered a blight on Sydney.
""I challenge the Treasurer to pursue his quest for beauty and fund the next round of great public architecture and domain,"" wrote architect Shaun Carter in an opinion piece on Wednesday. 
Creating a city of architectural beauty, particularly with our public domain and public buildings, required a financial commitment from the state, he wrote.
""What a gift to the city it would be. He could start with one of his top 10 constructions to be demolished, the Cahill Expressway.""
It would be expensive, as much as $3 billion, Mr Carter told the Herald. But it would be worth it if it resulted in an amazing public square in an area that already generates billions in tourist dollars.
Another equally attractive proposal was to turn it into a New York-style elevated high line running between the Domain and Barangaroo.
""Imagine having a family picnic right above Circular Quay. Just sitting there going, 'wow, this is public',"" he said.
The Cahill: keep it as a grand edge and colonnade to #Sydney Harbour or demolish it and bury the railway station underground to make a great public square?
Wouldn't it be great if the Treasurer funded a design comp?@PhilipThalis @NSWChapterPres #nswpol https://t.co/Y5aKf0DgsQ
— Shaun Carter (@ShaunCarter70) November 25, 2020
Mr Stokes said Sydney had been the most intact Victorian city in the world in the 1960s. ""We consciously tore it to bits, we wanted to shed off our image as a staid, colonial outpost. We wanted to embrace modernity.
""Now we can look back and realise we lost a lot but we also gained a lot. Some of the buildings on Dom Perrottet's list that he regards as eyesores are now celebrated places like Australia Square and the MLC Centre.
""I don't for one moment discount the loss of what they replaced, but without some destruction you never get progress,"" said Mr Stokes. He said the idea of knocking everything down was as repugnant as the idea of saving everything. ""We need to consider whether buildings are useful and beautiful and can be adapted to a new use."""

What's on TV 
 YUSUF HAWKINS: STORM OVER BROOKLYN (2020) 9 p.m. on HBO. Thirty-one years ago this month, Yusuf Hawkins was killed in the Bensonhurst neighborhood of Brooklyn, in what became one of the city's most notorious hate crimes and a sign of its racial divisions in the 1980s and '90s. This documentary revisits the case -- in which Hawkins, a Black teenager, was pursued by a mob of white youths, then shot -- through archival footage and interviews with Hawkins's family. Also interviewed are public figures like the Rev. Al Sharpton, who led protests after the killing and helped turn the case into an argument for change. ''I don't know who shot Yusuf,'' Sharpton said at Hawkins's funeral in 1989, ''but the system loaded the gun.''
 THE GO-GO'S (2020) 7:20 p.m. on Showtime. Early in this documentary about the band the Go-Go's, the guitarist Jane Wiedlin describes her submersion into the Los Angeles punk scene of the 1970s. ''People used to cross the street when they saw me,'' she says. ''I felt powerful for the first time.'' By taking the D.I.Y. grit of that Los Angeles scene and finishing it with a pop sheen, the Go-Go's rose to history-making levels of success. Their debut album, ''Beauty and the Beat,'' released in 1981, was the first record by an all-female group whose members wrote its songs and played their own instruments to hit No. 1 on the Billboard album chart. In the documentary, which debuted earlier this month, the director Alison Ellwood revisits the band's punk roots, its rise to fame and the tensions that followed.
 What's Streaming
 MUPPETS NOW Stream on Disney+. Jim Henson's furry brainchildren get a jolt of internet energy -- in more ways than one -- in this new streaming series, in which Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy and company perform sketches that spoof online video formats. The show is the latest attempt to modernize the Muppets after ''The Muppets,'' an ABC sitcom with the characters, struggled to recapture viewers' hearts in 2015. This new show may have better luck. '''Muppets Now' improves on the ABC sitcom because it understands what the Muppets are and why we love them,'' James Poniewozik wrote in a recent article in The New York Times. ''They're not mopey stand-ins for us but wild, demonic imaginings of ourselves, unburdened by impulse control and the laws of physics.''
 ABOMINABLE (2019) Stream on Hulu; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. If you or your children prefer your cute creatures computer-animated, skip Kermit and consider this movie instead. A creation of DreamWorks Animation and the Chinese production company Pearl Studio, written and directed by Jill Culton, ''Abominable'' tells the story of Yi, a girl (voiced by Chloe Bennet) who goes on a journey with a magical yeti named Everest. It is, Glenn Kenny wrote in his review for The Times, ''an exceptionally watchable and amiable animated tale.''

Good morning.
(Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today delivered to your inbox.)
In early March, I talked with a pair of researchers at the University of Southern California who had recently published a study — funded by the Tony Hawk Foundation — showing how skateboarding helps build resilience among young skaters, and helps them form communities across backgrounds.
“The stereotype is white stoner guys,” Dr. Zoë Corwin, one of the researchers, told me at the time. “The reality in 2020 is the skateboarding community is really, really diverse, and not only are they diverse, for many skaters, that’s a point of pride.”
[Track California’s coronavirus cases by county.]
As protests against police brutality continued and reckonings over deeply rooted racism picked up steam, Neftalie Williams, the co-author of the study, an expert in skate diplomacy and a longtime skater himself, emailed me to catch up.
The findings in the study, as well as Mr. Williams’s ongoing work around race and skateboarding culture, had taken on new urgency.
“There’s this broader narrative in sports that sport is the great equalizer,” Mr. Williams told me last week. “But what’s in our report is that the rhetoric of a colorblind approach is not the world people live in — it’s not the world skaters of color live in.”
Skateboarding’s ethos is defined, in some ways, by resistance to authority and by bodily autonomy.
So skateboarding is how many young skaters first come in contact with the police or security guards. It may lead to their first questions about who gets to use public space and why.
In the earlier days of the pandemic-driven lockdowns, for instance, it felt pointed when skate parks were filled with sand to prevent skaters from congregating.
“People want to stop you,” Mr. Williams said. “They want to get in your way.”
For young skaters who are black or Latino, looking for places to skate may be their first time recognizing that those encounters will go differently for them than for their white friends.
Mr. Williams told me that in his research, he’s interviewed the parents of professional skaters of color, who recalled having to give their sons or daughters the talk.
“They might want to get a little flippant, because they’re kids,” he said. But the parents had to tell their children: “You cannot question authority, because you will not come home to me.”

That was something Mr. Williams, who is black, recalled experiencing when he was growing up in Massachusetts. He remembered once walking through a parking lot with his board and being accosted by a police officer who apparently believed he was trying to steal a car.
“I remember thinking, ‘I don’t even have my license, how could I steal a car?’” Mr. Williams said. It was something his white friends didn’t experience.
Those encounters also leave impressions on young white skaters, who may not otherwise see racism at work, he said.
While the study found that skateboarding communities still sometimes leave girls and young women who skate feeling pushed aside, Mr. Williams said that the pace of evolution in a sport that’s only about 60 years old has been rapid, in large part because groups form more organically than they do in other sports.
“Young skaters are really excited to demonstrate to each other and en masse that they’re important and they want a better world,” he said.
In recent days, skaters have organized protests, like one in San Francisco, “Bomb Hills 4 Black Lives,” which Curbed San Francisco reported aimed to draw attention to racism at the hands of the authorities, but also within the skateboarding community.
Skaters carried signs that said, “Listen to black skaters,” and “Abolish the police,” as they rocketed down the city’s famous hills.
Mr. Williams said those are the kinds of impulses that schools, universities and businesses need to pay attention to, invest in, and foster, particularly as skateboarding gains more mainstream attention. (It was set to make its Olympic debut this year.)
He said he’s been glad to see skate companies issue statements or announce big donations to racial justice groups.
But what he’d rather see, he said, is more work in individual neighborhoods — helping young skaters get gear, starting mentorship programs, or lobbying cities to build skate parks.
“You don’t have to leave it to someone else,” Mr. Williams said.

Christian Cooper, the Black bird-watcher whose cellphone video of Amy Cooper calling the police on him in Central Park unleashed the wrath of the internet on her, explained in aWashington Postop-edTuesday why he isn t cooperating with prosecutors in the criminal case against her, saying that he doesn t want to see Amy Cooper in jail for an offense where he suffered no harm.

KEY FACTS
Christian Cooper said he believes Amy Cooper s actions reveal long-standing, deep-seated racial bias in the U.S., but added she should not be charged with a crime because she has already lost her job and her reputation, and it s hard to see what is to be gained by a criminal charge, aside from the upholding of principle, he said.
 If her current setbacks aren t deterrent enough to others seeking to weaponize race, it s unlikely the threat of legal action would change that, he wrote.
Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vancechargedher last week with falsely reporting an incident in the third degree, which is punishable with up to a year in jail.
Christian Cooper emphasized that he didn t suffer any mental or physical harm from the incident, adding that if the fear is that the police would have done me harm as a result of Cooper s call, then the solution is to fix policing. 
Cooper s argument is also shared by a subset of criminal justice reform advocates, including Josie Duffy Rice, the president of nonprofit website The Appeal, who tweeted that charging Amy Cooper reinforces the idea that justice can only be found in the disastrous carceral system we ve created. 
Crucial quote
 So while acknowledging the principle at stake, I must err on the side of compassion and choose not to be involved in this prosecution. Let the DA do his job. He has already decided to pursue charges; if he feels my involvement is essential to the case, he can subpoena me. If subpoenaed, I will testify, truthfully and accurately. Otherwise, the case is the DA s, not mine, Christian Cooper wrote.
Chief critic
Christian Cooper s sister, Melody, said in a statement on Twitter she disagrees with her brother s decision. What is true for my brother, who rarely has run-ins with the police, certainly not violent ones, is not true for most men in the Black community. He can afford to be compassionate, but that is NOT the case for most Black men in this country. Not by a long shot, she said.

Black Americans remain among the poorest and most oppressed in society. 
Under Obama, Black wealth was decimated by two-thirds, Flint, Michigan's water was poisoned and countless unarmed Black men were shot and killed by police.As a gay Latino from an immigrant working class family, I look at Councilmember Ritchie Torres' campaign to represent my district in Congress and ask: What will he do to materially improve the lives of LGBTQ Bronxites? Like Obama to Black America, Torres is feted by the media as an obvious choice for us simply because he is an openly gay man running against a known bigot, Councilmember Ruben Diaz Sr. But being of the LGBTQ community, does not make Torres for us.My neighbors aren't clamoring for identity-based representation; they're demanding that their next congressperson fight for their basic human needs. They are calling for dignified housing, properly funded public schools, jobs that pay a living wage and an end to environmental racism and the over policing of our subways and streets.I'm looking for a candidate with substantive policy proposals that directly address the root causes of poverty and oppression. Media pundits may love the idea of an openly gay Afro-Latino being elected to Congress, but as a constituent of NY-15, I would like to know what policies Torres will fight for to materially improve the standard of living for Black, Latino and LGBTQ people in the South Bronx. I truly don't know what Torres stands for because his website has no platform or list of policies he would advocate for in Congress. Seriously.Torres has undoubtedly suffered individual oppression as an openly gay Afro-Latino, but the agenda he has championed as New York City Councilman is completely at odds with the interests of working-class queer people of color in the South Bronx. He has repeatedly voted to increase police budgets and put more cops in subways. He authored a watered-down'police accountability' bill that failed to crack down on the NYPD's profiling of all marginalized communities, including trans women of color. He voted to build new jails across New York City, including one in my backyard. He accepts campaign contributions from luxury real-estate developers and Republican billionaires. In short, Torres does not have the moral authority to represent the diverse, revolutionary community of the South Bronx. He is not for us.I'm supporting Samelys Lopez for Congress because she correctly understands that racism and homophobia doesn't just stem from individual prejudices, but from something more foundational: the inherently oppressive nature of capitalism as designed by its White male founders. She has the strongest LGBTQ platform of any candidate in this race because comprehensive universal programs address our community's greatest struggles: violence, poverty, homelessness, discrimination, unemployment, and health injustice. CityViews[1] are readers' opinions, not those of City Limits. Add your voice today![2] LGBTQ youth are overrepresented in homeless shelters; Samelys fiercely advocates for a Homes Guarantee, acknowledging the abuse and rejection suffered by LGBTQ teens.LGBTQ youth of color, particularly Black youth, are pushed towards criminalized behaviors such as drug sales or survival sex, which increase their risk of arrest and detainment; Samelys is fighting to end the war on drugs and use revenue generated through legalized cannabis sales to fund social programs for Black communities.Transgender sex workers are especially at risk of murder; Samelys is fighting to decriminalize sex work because the criminalization of sex work is an attack on the lives and livelihoods of working class people.Transgender individuals disproportionately suffer from high unemployment; Samelys is fighting for a federal equivalent of New York State's Gender Expression Non-Discrimination Act (GENDA), which would add gender identity and expression to the state's human rights and hate crimes laws as protected classes, and ban discrimination in employment, housing, and public accommodations.Transgender women of color are more than twice as likely to live in extreme poverty than Whites; Samelys is fighting for a federal Jobs Guarantee and a Universal Basic Income of $2,000 per month.Finally, Samelys is an unapologetic supporter of single-payer Medicare for All because it would guarantee mental health services, reproductive care, and all transition-related care such as hormone replacement therapy and gender reassignment surgery to everyone regardless of income.As the nation's poorest Congressional district, the South Bronx deserves more than empty rhetoric. We're living in an age of historic income and wealth inequality, and Samelys Lopez is the only candidate in the race to discuss LGBTQ issues with class consciousness. We will not achieve justice for Black and Brown LGBTQ people simply by electing one. We must reject the corporate rainbow-capitalist agenda that ignores the plight of working and oppressed people. Samelys Lopez is exactly what people like me desperately need: someone who leads with love and empathy, who crafts policy solutions that combat white supremacy and institutionalized oppression, and most importantly, someone we can trust.Richie Merino is a gay Latino from a working class immigrant family.

Global markets this morning are higher. European indices higher across the board as lockdown ease up. Take a look at the FT 100, up 66, the CAC quarante up 83, and the DAX index in Germany up 256 points this morning, encouraging signs of growth in the Eurozone. We had the Purchasing Manager's Index for the month of May out. It was up from a level of 12 in April to 30.5 in the month of May.
In Asia overnight markets rallied there as well. South Korea announcing an additional $29 billion in stimulus. And China's economy reportedly expanding. The PMI was out in China as well. It rose to a level of 55 in the month of May. Anything above 50 shows growth. But export orders were down for a fourth month in a row in China.
Joining me this morning, Dagen McDowell, Tom Bevan and Michael Lee.
It is great to see everybody this morning on a big show.
DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Great to see you. We are driving by -- driving by all these stores that were totally boarded up this morning, including Whole Foods. There was like a little plywood door cut out for people to go in and out. It's insane.
BARTIROMO: It's so sad. I saw some of those pictures yesterday and it really was devastating to see all of those stores, all boarded up and what is taking place in New York City this week.
Among the top stories that we are watching this morning, tensions are still running high across America as protests go on for an eighth straight day over the killing of George Floyd. Peaceful demonstrators deterring violence and looting yesterday as police departments across the country crack down on curfews.
But some protesters defied those orders. In New York City, protesters got stuck on the Manhattan Bridge. Look at this. They blocked both sides for more than an hour, stretching past the city's 8:00 p.m. curfew. Twenty- eight states, along with Washington, D.C., have activated the National Guard at this point.
In Washington, D.C., mostly peaceful demonstrations heated up, though, yesterday, just after midnight, when protesters attempted to tear down the eight-foot fence at Lafayette Park near the White House. Police using pepper spray to control the crowd. This after the mainstream media wrongly reported that officers used tear gas on protesters Monday before President Trump's walk to St. John's Church. Park police say officers, in fact, did not use tear gas at all but a form of pepper spray that may produce similar symptoms.
Nearly 3,000 police (ph) arrested in southern California since Friday during demonstrations over George Floyd's death. Most of those arrests happening in Los Angeles County. The suspects charged with looting, burglary and vandalism according to ""The L.A. Times.""
Los Angeles police also arresting a man for allegedly impersonating a National Guard soldier. Thirty-one-year-old Gregory Wong taken into custody overnight, along with a supply of weapons, after he allegedly tried to join a unit protecting downtown LA from looters.
Meanwhile, protesters again taking to the streets of New York City last night, ignoring curfews and roadblocks put in place to protect the city.
Kristina Partsinevelos is in midtown Manhattan this morning with more.
Kristina.
KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Maria, you did mention that several protesters stayed out past the curfew. It was the second night in a row. But here on Madison Avenue, we're seeing barely any damage. If you take a look at some of the stores behind me are boarded up, including here, Balenciaga, just your high-end store. And I want to point out how high these wooden planks have to go because what happens with looters, not protesters, is they'll rip it down, which is why everything seems to be 10 feet or more.
But not everybody's putting up plywood. This is a Balenciaga store over here. Look at the inside. They completely gutted the whole store. Retailers and businesses aren't taking any chances.
We also have footage from just across the city, so it's like we're in a hurricane, or preparing for a hurricane given that absolutely almost every storefront is boarded up.
You've seen, unfortunately, looters rip through those plywoods. Often there's glass that needs to be swept up in the morning. And this is the scene across the city. You had several people tried to block protesters or looters from entering a Footlocker and a GAP yesterday evening. It appears -- and even Mayor de Blasio tweeted that yesterday at around 11:00 p.m. saying that the curfew seems to be working because there's less damage this morning or less damage at that point.
If you take a look, too, we have some footage of Apple, the iconic Apple store, which is on Fifth Avenue, just near Central Park. It's normally a big glass cube. But, instead, they've boarded it up with wood. Also, there are some guards over there.
But, overall, Maria, I spoke to two police officers that did want to point out that the looters and thieves are tacking themselves onto the protesters, but they're being very specific. They'll take their cars, or they'll take scooters, target stores and then switch and move to another location. So it's causing the police officers in this city to constantly zip around throughout the evening to the various targeted locations.
But at this point, the entire city is boarded up. It's like we just had a hurricane come through here. I don't know what else they can possibly hit, but it seems to be a little bit better this morning.
Back to you.
BARTIROMO: Yes. And it was hard enough as a result of the shutdown. This will, obviously, only elongate the trouble that New York City and our retail sector is facing across the country.
Kristina, thank you. We'll keep watching that.
Kristina Partsinevelos in New York City this morning.
And joining me right now is Pennsylvania senator, Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee member, Pat Toomey.
And, Senator, it's good to have you this morning. Thanks very much for being here.
SEN. PAT TOOMEY (R-PA): Good morning, Maria.
BARTIROMO: We did see significantly less violent, as you just heard. Protesters took to the streets peacefully last night with fewer police confrontations.
Give us your perspective and assessment of how these protests have changed and where the situation is today.
TOOMEY: Well, Maria, first of all, look, I think any American who saw the video of George Floyd's death was sickened by it, as I was. And I understand completely the anger and the grief. People have every right to protest, provided that the protest is peaceful.
And what we've had in recent days, without any doubt, are opportunistic thugs who decided this was a chance to just loot and riot and engage in mayhem. And, unfortunately, too many elected officials in cities and governors around the country decided that maybe they needed a little bit of room and -- and, in fact, what you need to do is nip that kind of violence in the bud.
Finally, it looks like more resources are being put to work, more of the manpower that we have is being deployed. And, hopefully, we've turned the corner on this violence. It's completely unacceptable and cannot be tolerated.
BARTIROMO: What can the government do? What can this administration do to calm things down? You've been critical of the president's reaction to these demonstrations. Early this week you suggested that the president, quote, change the tone of his message. What do you mean?
TOOMEY: Yes, well, so my message was about how important it is that we have zero tolerance for this violence, that we deploy the manpower that we need. My message is that this is -- it is simply not true that our police forces are systemically racist, that most police are somehow the problem. The fact is the police are the solution.
And my message has been, they've got to be used and used properly so that we can restore law and order. That is government's first obligation. And so I think some of the president's tweets could have -- could have been different. I'm not his tweet editor. And that -- that's not the point and that's not the problem here. The problem here are these bandits, criminals, who have seized an opportunity to wreak havoc. That can't be tolerated.
BARTIROMO: Yes. And this is only going to elongate a recovery that we would we like to see for small business and overall Americans who are out of work.
TOOMEY: Well --
BARTIROMO: President Trump is looking to press forward and negotiate -- yes, go ahead, sir.
TOOMEY: Yes, no, it's so important that we get back to work. Many places, including my state of Pennsylvania, has been way too shut down for way too long. It's overdue. And now this is a terrible setback for so many people.
But, Maria, it's even worse than that. You know, we know from having gone through similar experiences in the past, when the police come under attack like this, there's the Ferguson effect. When the police are being attacked on the streets and then being second guessed by political figures --
BARTIROMO: That's right.
TOOMEY: The danger is that they withdraw to some degree and then murder rates and crime rates in those very neighborhoods go through the roof. And so that's the real danger here, as well as the economic danger. And this is why you cannot tolerate violence.
BARTIROMO: Yes. Which is why there's criticism for not supporting our troops, not supporting our law enforcement. I mean, you know, if the police do not expect that the governor and the mayor are going to have their back if somebody throws water on their heads, then they're not going to come out. They're not going to be as aggressive as you would expect.
TOOMEY: Right.
BARTIROMO: And when you're talking about an economy that continues to look like it's tough out there, that also creates more crime. I mean the president is trying to press forward on negotiations for the next round of the coronavirus relief as early as this week. Democrats, some Democrats and Republicans are still clashing over what should be included in that next package.
Where do you stand on this? What are you looking for, for -- in terms of what should be in the next relief package?
TOOMEY: Maria -- yes -- I'm not at all sure that we need another relief package, Maria. Look at what we have already done. Between the direct spending that we have approved, that we've authorized, and the lending from the Fed that we've authorized to complement that, that will total something on the order of $6 trillion. Like 30 percent of the entire annual economic output of the United States.
BARTIROMO: Yes. That's right.
TOOMEY: And, Maria, far less than half of it is even out the door yet. Why would we be talking about going back and either printing more money or borrowing more money, because those are the only two options, when most of the money we've already authorized hasn't even gone out the door and our economy is beginning to reopen. I'm not at all convinced that -- we certainly don't need another piece of legislation now. I'm not convinced that we will.
We'll -- we -- I think we should wait. Let's see. Maybe a month from now we'll see that there are some serious needs that still are unmet. But, boy, we've done an awful lot. We've -- you know, we've replaced the vast majority of lost income for people. For low income workers, we've actually more than replaced their lost income. The demand is going to be there. It's a matter of being able to open up safely. I think business can do that.
Obviously, this whole series of riots has been extremely unhelpful in -- in this regard at many levels. But it's not clear to me that we need yet another round of hundreds of billions of dollars when so much hasn't even been spent yet from previous rounds.
BARTIROMO: And, by the way, while so many are actually making more money right now being home than they would be on the job --
TOOMEY: Right.
BARTIROMO: The idea to give them more money to stay home, why would they come back? You want the economy open in the -- in the next couple of weeks. That program goes in -- is in place until the end of July.
TOOMEY: Yes.
BARTIROMO: So why would they actually come back if they're making more to be home.
Real quick, Senator, we've got to jump. (INAUDIBLE)
TOOMEY: Yes, it was shocking when our Democrats insisted that people should get paid more not to work than they get paid to work. That's a very, very bad idea. It's really -- it's really time to reopen this economy. Fortunately it's starting in most places. That's really the answer here, getting people back to earning their livelihoods.
BARTIROMO: Senator, it's good to see you this morning. Thank you, sir.
TOOMEY: Thanks for having me.
BARTIROMO: We will see you soon. Senator Pat Toomey joining us from Pennsylvania.
Coming up this morning, former New York Governor David Paterson is here on current Governor Andrew Cuomo saying that, yes, he has the power to remove New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio from office.
Then at 8:00 a.m. Eastern, senior advisor to the president, Kevin Hassett, is here on the May ADP number. We'll talk jobs. We will also talk about that expectation of a recovery over 10 years.
Plus the AFL-CIO president, Richard Trumka, joining me on manufacturing in America during the protests and the pandemic. Don't miss a moment of it. We've got a lot coming up.
Quick break. Stay with us.
And then jobs in America. The expectations for the May ADP report just out in over an hour from now. We're breaking it all down. We'll tell you where the opportunities are in this crunch of an economy.
Then New York Governor Cuomo sounds off, slamming New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio over the violent protests and looting. That's ahead. Stay with us.
BARTIROMO: Let's take a look at markets this morning. The melt-up continues. Check this out. Futures pointing to another rally at the start of trading. We're looking at a gain of almost 200 points on the Dow this morning, up 173. The Nasdaq futures up 33 and the S&P futures up 14. We've got some optimism over businesses across the country reopening and progress being made toward a coronavirus treatment, eventually a vaccine.
This morning we expect the private sector employment estimate from ADP ahead of the Friday jobs report. We are expecting 9 million jobs lost last month. That even though it is a sharp number, an improvement actually from the more than 20 million jobs lost in the month of April due to the pandemic.
Joining us right now is Citi Private Bank Chief Investment Officer David Bailin.
And, David, it is great to see you again this morning. Thanks very much for joining us.
DAVID BAILIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, CIT PRIVATE BANK: Thank you.
BARTIROMO: First, before I ask you how you're allocating capital and what you're telling clients, can you give us your sense of the backdrop as we await the ADP and as we know now 40 million people have already filed for unemployment benefits in the last nine weeks.
BAILIN: Well, this is an unusual time. You know, this has been a shutdown of the economy like almost an engineered national strike in order to keep everybody safe. So it's very different than a normal recession. And the recovery will be as well. We expect, you know, about half the people who have lost their jobs during this one -- you know, second quarter, will actually been re-employed in the third quarter and then there will be a slow recovery after that.
And part of that is due to the fact that the government took proactive action to actually support the economy with the fiscal measures you were just talking about, as well as with the monetary support. So we see a v- shaped recovery taking shape and we see a lot of people going back to work. And as a result of that, what we've done is we're rotating our clients' portfolios now to small and mid-cap stocks, which have performed so much less well than many of the large cap and extremely, you know, tech names that you're talking about quite frequently. And we think that that rotation will be very good for clients.
Our immediate outlook also shows that there are certain --
BARTIROMO: Michael Lee.
BAILIN: Like Brazil and Mexico that are deeply undervalued.
BARTIROMO: Yes, sorry.
Oh, so you still like Brazil and Mexico and some of the emerging markets out there, along with small and mid-caps in the U.S. then?
BAILIN: That's correct. We want our clients to really diversify in the areas of the market which have just not come back as much. If you think that the U.S. is going to come back, then certainly Mexico, which is a major supplier and manufacturer for us, as well as the sort of commodity areas of Brazil will come back. And these markets have been down about 50 percent in dollar terms. And if you look at 2009, they came back extraordinarily strongly.
So what we're doing is positioning our clients for the next 12 to 18 months, not for the news that's happening today. And there's quite a bit of money to be made, Maria, in the markets by doing that.
BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, I wonder what you think then of Chinese companies that are currently listed on the U.S. exchanges. We've been covering this for a while now and we've been going and walking through various bills in Congress. Senator Kennedy has a bill that basically says, look, if you -- if Chinese companies are listed in the U.S., they have to follow U.S. accounting rules. And if they don't, we should yank them off the exchanges. That bill passed the Senate. We are waiting to see if it goes to the president's desk and the president signs it into law.
Even the former national economic council director and Goldman Sachs president, Gary Cohn, on the program with me last week, weighed in on Chinese companies trading on U.S. exchanges.
Watch this. Got to get your take.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BARTIROMO: I know the China business was a big business for all the financial services companies --
GARY COHN, FORMER DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: Right.
BARTIROMO: But these guys don't even follow the rules of accounting standards in the United States, Gary. Shouldn't they be following the rules that every other company does if you want to be listed in New York?
COHN: Look, we have our GAAP accounting standards here in New York. And, yes, we should have any company listed in the United States follow our prescribed standards.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BARTIROMO: What do you think about that, David? Gary said he would not advise any companies looking to go public to list in Hong Kong, obviously with all the protesting going on there and now the overreach from China.
BAILIN: Yes, having excellent (ph) accounting standards, Maria, makes sense. You know, that's why -- part of the rules of, you know, listing for a stock on the exchange. And we have to remember that there really are several different groups of Chinese stocks specifically and the larger of them do follow many of the accounting standards, the international GAAP accounting standards that Gary Cohn was talking about.
So the idea of higher standards, I think, is, you know, is an important and good one. But we also have to remember that we want to have all of the international stocks, the highest quality stocks listed in the United States, listed in London, listed in Asia, right? We want to have a market that operates globally because that's good for investors and that's good for our clients.
BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes. Well, you definitely -- you definitely want to hear -- see diversity.
But real quick, David, on this, do you think if that does go into law, the president signs it into law, that those Chinese companies have got to follow U.S. accounting standards or they get yanked from the index, do -- do indexes like the SMCI Index, the global indexes, do you think they decline in value given the fact that those Chinese companies have such big representation on some of those ETFs and indexes.
BAILIN: Right. So, you know, in the event that they were to be eliminated from the indices, you know, Maria, then, of course, you know, it would definitely have a very large impact depending upon, you know, how those -- those companies actually performed. But what we really want to have happen, right, is better accounting standards for all companies globally so that investors have transparency.
BARTIROMO: Right. Sure.
BAILIN: And so if we move this out of the (INAUDIBLE) to the business realm, you know, what we want to do is encourage the following of those standards. And I think that's -- you know, that should be the non-political reason to do this.
BARTIROMO: Yes.
BAILIN: We want U.S., you know, investors to have (INAUDIBLE) to Asia, which is one of our dominant trends for the next 10 years. We want more clients, more money there. And that's going to be good for American investors to do that.
BARTIROMO: Understood.
BAILIN: So having better standards I think is a very wise idea and giving, you know, good -- ample time for having people meet those standards makes complete sense to us.
BARTIROMO: David, thank you so much for being here.
David Bailin from Citi.

Investigating the death of George Floyd. Minnesota's State Department of Human Rights taking a closer look at the Minneapolis Police Department. Governor Tim Walz says that the probe will focus on evidence of systematic racism within the department.
Joining me right now is Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano.
Judge, what do you think?
JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: I think it's too little too late. I mean this is not a lawsuit against the Minneapolis Police Department, this is an internal investigation by the Bureau of Human Rights of the state of Minnesota against the Minneapolis Police Department. This is probably basically a PR venture on the part of the governor. Something like this should have been done a long time ago, long before George Floyd was killed.
Nevertheless, it's a step in the right direction. They're probably going to discover a lot of other issues in the department about which we don't know and maybe remedy them before there's another catastrophe.
BARTIROMO: I mean -- I mean didn't this guy -- didn't this guy have 17 infractions?
NAPOLITANO: The Minneapolis Police Department has been bedeviled by these problem for years. They just don't have the training that Los Angeles or Chicago or New York has. It's well-known in the legal community.
BARTIROMO: I mean one of -- one of -- the officers that kneeled on George Floyd's neck, didn't he have like 17 infractions?
NAPOLITANO: Yes, he did. And -- and the other three officers -- I am waiting for them to be charged, Maria. They should be charged with aiding and abetting. First of all, he should be charged with first degree murder because during the eight minutes that the knee was on Floyd's neck, he obviously planned and plotted to continue killing.
BARTIROMO: Right.
NAPOLITANO: So that's intent and planning. They should be charged with failing to stop a murder and with -- by failing to stop it, they aided and abetted it. They haven't been charged with anything.
BARTIROMO: Let me -- I want to switch gears and ask you about bail reform because the more than 400 people arrested for looting in New York City will most likely go free after receiving a burglary charge due to the state's recently passed bail reform laws. This is according to a court spokesperson. The new laws prohibit bail for felony burglary charges, Judge. And we've been railing about this new bail reform program now for two years where no bail means they process them and the criminal's back on the street and what do they do, they go and they commit more crimes, making our cities unsafe.
NAPOLITANO: Well, this is -- yes, you're right, I mean this is the chickens coming home to roost. This was the -- the brainchild of Governor Cuomo, who now, of course, wants to address this by putting the military in the streets. He can put the military in the streets and they can arrest people and they can appear before judges and they'll be right back on the streets. It doesn't matter who does the arresting. And then New York, it doesn't even matter what the evidence is against you because the law ties the hands of judges. Dagen and I have been screaming about this, and you have as well, since this law became law. It is just an attack on the property of individuals by allowing this revolving door of people who should be in jail to get arrested, appear before a judge, back out on the streets. And, by the way, all this happens in 36 hours.
BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, you know, when I spoke with Andrew Cuomo about a month ago, he said, I am going to look at this and have a change in this by April 1st. That came and went I guess because of the pandemic. But we haven't seen any changes.
Judge, we'll keep watching that. Andrew Napolitano.
NAPOLITANO: Well --
BARTIROMO: Yes, go ahead, final word. Go ahead, sir.
NAPOLITANO: OK. You know, he -- it's not his fault that the legislature is not meeting. But it is his fault that this misguided legislation has existing for two years.
BARTIROMO: Right. Exactly. Thank you. We will see you soon.
Coming up, we are talking about Governor Cuomo slamming New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. Former New York Governor David Paterson will weigh in as the state deals with ongoing protests. That's next.
Stay with us.
BARTIROMO: Welcome back.
The GOP looking for a new host city to hold its convention this summer.
Cheryl Casone with the details there.
Cheryl.
CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Maria.
President Trump announced last night that he has no choice but to move the convention out of North Carolina after Governor Roy Cooper refused to guarantee coronavirus restrictions won't limit capacity at the venue. Here's what the president tweeted in part, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper and his representatives refuse to guarantee that we can have use of the Spectrum Arena -- spend millions of dollars, have everybody arrive and then tell them they will not be able to gain entry. Governor Cooper is still in shelter in place mode. We are now forced to seek another state to host the 2020 Republican National Convention.
Georgia Senator Kelly Loeffler says she is in talks about holding the convention in her state. Nashville, Tennessee, has also been mentioned.
Well, long-time Iowa Congressman Steve King has lost his seat. This happened last night in the primary. Republicans endorsed a primary challenger after King was criticized for a history of racist comments. State Senator Randy Feenstra winning the Republican primary overnight. He will face Democrat J.D. Scholten in November.
Well, shares of Tiffany plunged nearly 9 percent yesterday following a report that the company's purchase by LVMH could be on the rocks. ""Women's Wear Daily"" says LVMH may not go forward with the $16 billion deal amid the Covid-19 pandemic and the protests over George Floyd's death. LVMH board members also are apparently concerned about whether Tiffany could repay its debt obligations when that takeover is completed.
And those are your headlines from the newsroom, Maria. Back to you.
BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you.
Well, unrest in the empire state continues, New York City seeing largely peaceful protests yesterday. Crowds marching to Manhattan's upper east side where Mayor Bill de Blasio lives. More reports of looting as night fell, though. Protesters defied the new 8:00 p.m. curfew, though the unrest did appear less violent than on Monday night. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo spoke out about the violence yesterday, blasting Mayor de Blasio for not doing this job.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night. I believe that.
Look at the videos. It was a disgrace.
I believe the mayor underestimates the scope of the problem. I think he underestimates the duration of the problem.
My option is to displace the mayor of New York City and bring in the National Guard.
Do your job. Do what you've done in the past. You know how you've stopped looting in the past and how you stopped rioting in the past? Do that again.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BARTIROMO: Joining me right now in a ""Fox Business Exclusive"" interview is the former governor of New York, and Las Vegas Sands senior vice president, David Paterson.
Governor, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining me. It is great to have your insights.
And what do you think about that in terms of Governor Cuomo being able to replace Mayor de Blasio? Can he do that?
DAVID PATERSON (D), FORMER NEW YORK GOVERNOR: Maria, under Article 4, Section 2 of the New York State Constitution, the broad supervisory powers that the governor possesses would allow him to supersede the authority of a local elected official through Executive Law 63, Section 2. So he could do that.
The use for this has been common by governors, often when they replaced a district attorney with a special prosecutor because they thought an investigation had been tainted. Here, you would have to show corruption, you'd have to show wrong-doing or you'd have to show a reckless disregard for human safety, which is, I think, where the governor would try to go in this case. But he said that the mayor underestimated the, you know, the problems with the rioting. I think it would have to rise to a level where he knew that he was doing it and recklessly disregarded the public.
BARTIROMO: So -- so what do you think is reckless? Let's show some of these pictures of New York right here, whether it's downtown in SoHo where, you know, storefronts were cracked -- windows cracked and broken into, or Madison Avenue uptown where some of the big, high end stores like Balenciaga and Chanel were -- were -- were efforts to breach there.
I mean what -- what is reckless? This went on for hours, Governor. What would you have done?
PATERSON: Well, I -- well, you see, a strong police presence before the riots ever get started usually quells this kind of disturbance. But we're dealing with a different type of riot than we were years ago. Years ago it was people from the community who were outraged by a shooting, a hate crime, a police involved shooting. What we have now is clearly outside agitators who actually bring the bricks in that are being thrown at people and who actually are waiting in the crowd, waiting until it gets late, when people are more vulnerable, and then starting situations. And, unfortunately, frustrated people follow them.
So, in this particular case, you know, I think a lot of elected officials on both sides of the aisle have made mistakes in dealing with these types of situations, underestimating how bad it would actually get.
But I think you would have to have a showing that the elected official didn't care, like I'm doing it my way and I don't care what the facts say or what the pictures show.
BARTIROMO: Well, I mean, the pictures are clear and -- and you've heard the violence. I mean, would you have brought in the National Guard at this point? You know, he's pushing back to bring in the National Guard, the mayor is.
PATERSON: Well, I think that -- I think that the governor in this particular case can actually execute that without even having to take any action against the mayor. He is the governor of the state. He's the commander in chief of the law enforcement around the state and has significant influence over the National Guard. If he so chooses. He's trying to let the mayor make that decision.
There are a lot of factors that go into making that decision that I don't know. So I couldn't tell you that I would know what to do in this situation.
One problem that no one has raised --
BARTIROMO: Right, well let me -- yes.
PATERSON: Because this would be a terrible time -- a terrible time for a terrorist attack. If there was any evidence of something like that, I would bring in anyone I could to stop it.
BARTIROMO: Well, it's a great point. Well, yesterday, I spoke with New York City -- former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and I asked him for his take of what was going on in this city. Listen to him. I want to get your reaction.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
RUDY GIULIANI, FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: The mayor should step down. He's incompetent. We are moving -- we are losing a tremendous amount of property. We're seeing people damaged and hurt seriously. And pretty soon we're going to lose some lives if this man doesn't get out of the way and let someone activate the police department.
BARTIROMO: How do you know that he's holding back the police department? I mean you're right, all of that looting and destruction last --
GIULIANI: Because I --
BARTIROMO: Night should have been stopped sooner.
GIULIANI: He's following -- and all the -- all these liberal, progressive mayors are following a playbook that's about 35 years old and totally discredited. It's called the venting theory. They let them sort of like get it out of their system for a day or two and then the city blows.
You don't have to tell this police department to do the job. All he has to do is step aside, these will be over in one night.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
\BARTIROMO: What do you think about that, Governor? And, by the way, you know, we're talking a lot about New York City. It's not just New York City. You know, an officer was rammed into in Buffalo. I mean it's all over the state.
Your reaction?
PATERSON: Maria, next time you see the mayor, tell him that I thought he made a good point for a change. He'll be shocked to hear that. The reality is that exactly what I just said, this is a different type of group that's causing these riots now. Most people really don't want to see any violence at this particular time because you practically have a prima facie case staring us -- right at us of excessive use of police force causing the death of a human being. You don't need any -- any distraction from that. And we've been distracted for weeks and that -- for, you know, a period of time now and, honestly, anything that would keep the peace in cities around this country could get us to focus back on a bigger problem, which is that the peaceful protests are trying to point out problems that exist in the police department as they exist with elected officials. They have trouble weeding out the bad eggs. And if we could get past that in both areas, our country would be in a lot better place than it is now.
BARTIROMO: Well, I think you make a really important point. How do you weed out the bad eggs? I mean how do you know where the racism is in the police department? This has got to stop.
This is on top of more than 400 people awaiting arraignment in Manhattan criminal court yesterday afternoon for allegedly looting stores the night before. Because of New York state's bail reform law passed earlier this year, most will likely be cut loose without bail.
I mean, David, look at -- look at the state you love so much. Look at the city we all love so much. We've got bail reform that has criminals back on the street in a couple of hours and they're committing more crimes. We've got people fleeing New York because the tax situation, homeless situation getting worse. And now, on top of all of that, we've got a pandemic, a shutdown and now looting as a result of the death of George Floyd. How are we going to get out of this? How long is it going to take for New York to get strong again, in your view?
PATERSON: Well said, Maria. Well, said, Maria. You know, we're looking for a new mayor in 2001. You might want to consider that.
The point is that the bail reform needed to happen, but what -- the way it was passed was excessive. It allowed too many people out of jail. This is a situation where one person was released on bail at 12:00 and committed another crime at 4:00. We can't have that kind of thing going on. And I think most people in New York City know that. There are -- there were some problems with the previous bail system that we tried to address.
But I think the important thing is that this should be a hint to all of us that there have been a number of these police-involved shootings where there were no protests and people waited patiently for the system to do something and the system did not. So I think that's why you're feeling a lot of the outrage. There is no excuse for violence, looting, attacking the police or some of the things we've seen in the past week and you do have to take stringent members -- stringent forces to stop that.
BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there.
Governor,. It's great to see you this morning. Please come back soon. Thank you, sir.
PATERSON: Thank you, Maria. Talk to you soon.
BARTIROMO: And to you. David Paterson joining us.
Stay with us. We'll be right back.
BARTIROMO: Welcome back.
Suing Google for $5 billion. That is what a group of plaintiffs in a proposed class action suit are seeking, claiming that the technology giant gathers data from users despite using its Chrome browser supposedly private incognito mode. The suit claims the company still collects data through other applications and website plug-ins. Google is pushing back, saying, quote, as we clearly state each time you open a new incognito tab, websites might be able to collect information about your browsing activity.
Dagen McDowell, do you feel Google has misled the public with this so- called private mode. Once again we learn that, oh, yes, even though we thought it was private it's actually not.
MCDOWELL: Well, you know, it's incognito. So am I really unrecognizable if I have a hat and sunglasses on? No. And you're not on the Internet either.
This lawsuit is not going anywhere because if people think that they really can behave in a private manner on the Internet, then they have another thing coming.
Google's -- you read that statement from Google, but people for years have said that -- raised concerns that people's profiles are being tracked. And, again, by websites, by plug-ins. And 5 billion, you got to prove damages, don't you? What are the damages?
BARTIROMO: Michael, what about that? Are you surprised that another technology giant is being accused of surveilling users?
MICHAEL LEE, FOUNDER, MICHAEL LEE STRATEGY: Well, Maria, this is their business. They're in the business of taking your personal information and selling it. So I would say that $5 billion is a low number.
I -- I -- what I'll be interested to see if this -- if this case actually moves forward, because if it does move forward, I imagine the discovery will be extremely damaging for Google.
Look, Google has amassed more power than any other corporation in the history of, you know, basically in the history of the earth. It needs to be broken up. This is an evil, evil place and I think this is just the latest example of it.
BARTIROMO: I did a documentary on Google really now 10 years ago and, you know, about the fact that they have all of your -- your activity and -- in your search, your search activity, and they say they anonymize it after two years.
Why have it for two years in the first place was the question that I kept asking in my documentary.
Tom Bevan, this is an issue that's not going away and the administration is watching it, as they are watching free speech and the curtailing of conservative voices on social media.
TOM BEVAN, CO-FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, REALCLEARPOLITICS: Yes, I -- look, there's a real paradox here because as -- as users, as customers, we constantly sign away and agree to privacy, you know, policies that we don't even read, whether it's Apple or FaceBook or -- or Google or Amazon. And at the same time, you know, so we're being spied on. We know it. I mean everybody's had the experience where they say something and the, you know, two seconds later an ad shows up on your phone in one of your feeds. I mean we are being spied on. And so -- but I do think that is -- continues to raise privacy concerns. I'm not sure about this lawsuit in particular, but certainly the privacy concerns and the amount of information that -- that the public signs away to these companies is something that's -- that's going to be addressed certainly, you know, through regulation most likely.
BARTIROMO: Yes, for sure.
All right, stay with us. We've got a lot to come. Stay with us. We will be right back.
BARTIROMO: Welcome back.
Taking a look at oil prices this morning. Crude oil pulling back after hitting its highest level since March. The low price on this contract for oil was $17 a barrel. We're back up to $36.23.
Wow, Mike Lee, what a buying opportunity this was when we saw prices get -- really crash over the last couple of months, concerns about whether an early OPEC meeting will take place, that's why prices are under pressure this morning. But got to look at this as a victory at 36.27 on crude.
LEE: Yes, well, you know, we don't want to see prices to get too high, but we want them to be high enough so that our energy industry stays solvent and, you know, people don't lose their jobs and we can keep on trucking along. But if you -- if you think about this, we saw a dramatic drop in demand, in addition to -- and then after that a dramatic drop in supply. And I think, again, post-riot world, post protest world, a lot of people are going to be anxious to get out of their house and they're not going to put up with these lockdowns anymore, which is going to lead to an epic summer driving season as people are afraid to fly. So I can see the price going a lot higher from here.
BARTIROMO: And the Saudis and the Russians did reach a deal on oil cuts, which was among the reasons that prices bounded off of the lows, Dagen McDowell.
MCDOWELL: The average price for regular unleaded gasoline in this country has jumped 24-cents just since late April. It's back to close to $2 a gallon. And it's because people already are hitting the roads. There's data that indicates that congestion is picking up. The Dutch location technology firm Tom-Tom shows that traffic congestion is gradually climbing in many large U.S. cities. Apple's maps, the app activity is back to where it was in mid-January, that is the middle -- the middle of winter.
But, nevertheless, we are seeing people hit the road again. And to Mike's point, you will see a lot more driving as we get into the depths of summer.
BARTIROMO: Yes, first time I'm hoping for traffic congestion because you want to see an economy reopen and cars on the road and activity back to where it was.
We'll take a break. When we come back, still ahead, jobs in America. We're getting the May ADP report out in about 15 minutes' time. We will take a look, next hour, on MORNINGS WITH MARIA. We want to get a clear picture of where the job situation is today.
Stay with us.
BARTIROMO: Welcome back.
Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, June 3rd. Your top stories right now just before 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.
Protests raging on for an eighth day. People defying curfews last night. But there are signs of relief as many demonstrations were peaceful last night. First Lady Melania Trump is calling for everyone protest in peace and take care of one another. President Trump and the First Lady visited St. John Paul II National Shrine, followed by the signing of an executive order supporting religious freedom across the world.

The oddness of the all-virtual gathering was slightly less jarring than on the opening night (or maybe I was just more used to it). Old hands like Bill Clinton were mixed with young stars like New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in a series of virtual speeches. It was, overall, a markedly better two hours than I witnessed on Monday night.
Below the best -- and worst -- of the night that was.
HITS
* The McCain video: I am a rarely swayed by a Republican speaking at a Democratic convention (or vice versa). But the video -- narrated by Cindy McCain -- documenting the longtime friendship of John McCain and Joe Biden was extremely well done and reinforced a central message of Biden's presidential campaign: He is someone with the willingness and ability to work across the aisle -- someone who believes more in people than partisan labels. Hearing McCain's voice again was both haunting and uplifting, and a reminder that politics can be a good thing.
*Ady Barkan: The story of the young father afflicted with ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease) is well-known, but no less powerful for it. The video of Barkan playing with his young child, the voiceover of him explaining why he is fighting so hard on health care -- it was a hugely powerful, emotional and human moment.
* Jill Biden: She isn't Michelle Obama. But, well, no one is. Jill Biden did what she needed to in her speech -- she told the Biden story (a life marked by both tragedy and resilience) in a way that no one else could. Her testimonial to her husband's faith and how he leaned on it to get him through the hardest of times was important, too, disrupting the narrative pushed by President Donald Trump that the former vice president doesn't care about God. Plus, I liked the Biden cameo and the ""I'm Jill Biden's husband!"" introduction. A little hokey, sure. But that's what conventions are!
* Jacquelyn Brittany: Having the New York Times elevator operator who went viral when she told Biden that she loved him when he came by the paper to interview with the editorial board was a stroke of genius. And her words about Biden -- ""in the short time I spent with Joe Biden, I could tell he really saw me"" -- were a powerful testimonial to the Democratic nominee's humanity and empathy.
* The state roll call vote: There isn't much about a virtual convention that is better than the real thing. But the state roll call vote -- which serves to formally nominate the presidential nominee -- is one of them. It was fun to see what every state chose as its background -- Rhode Island with a chef standing off to the side with a plate of calamari was the BEST -- and who each state chose to deliver the votes to Joe Biden (and Bernie Sanders). (Khizr Khan, a Gold Star dad attacked by Trump during the 2016 race, and the parents of Matthew Shepard, who was killed in anti-gay hate crime, were particularly powerful choices.) And for a country that has been forced by Covid-19 to stay close to home for months, it was like a mini-trip around the country that I at least found hugely refreshing. And I wasn't the only one.
* John Legend: Dude is just plain talented. Also: How many people can pull off the white suit with a black turtleneck? Not I.
MISSES
* Bill Clinton: The former president has spoken at every Democratic convention since 1980. And he is a former Democratic president of the United States. So it's not easy to tell him no. But for a party that has fully embraced the #MeToo movement and is leaning on women to beat Donald Trump, the image of Clinton was a jarring one. (You may remember that as President he has an extramarital affair with a White House intern.) Clinton didn't get much time to speak (five-ish minutes) and it was in the very early moments of the night's programming. But still...
* Chuck Schumer: I could just imagine the ever-media-aware Senate Majority Leader setting up the shot -- Statue of Liberty in the background! -- for his speech. Except that the statue was so blurry that you could barely recognize it. ""I love that the planned symbolism of the shot was ruined by the need for a wide aperture to light it,"" tweeted AJ Chavar, a video journalist (and former colleague of mine at The Washington Post).
* Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Watching AOC deliver a 90-second nominating speech for Sanders in the first hour of the convention was sort of like going to a Yankees game and seeing Aaron Judge pinch-hit. It just felt sort of like a waste of talent. I understand that the Biden team didn't want AOC, a GOP lightning rod, to be front-and-center in a big primetime speech. But it felt like she could have been deployed in a much more effective way than she was.
* John Kerry: Meh. I mean, I understand the idea -- a former Democratic presidential nominee and Secretary of State using his perceived gravitas to help make the case that Donald Trump is dangerous to America's standing in the world. But another elder statesman of the Democratic old guard in a suit talking about why Trump is bad? In a decidedly senatorial tone? I could have done without it."

Certain parts of Brooklyn and Queens are under a zoned shutdown[7].

Here are some local and state hotlines for more information: NYC: 311; NY State Hotline: 888-364-3065; NJ State Hotline: 800-222-1222. Here's the latest: President Donald Trump is ""no longer considered a transmission risk to others,"" according to the latest update from his doctor, who was previously caught exaggerating the president's wellbeing [10]when he was treated for COVID-19 at Walter Reed Medical Center.Saturday morning's ""COVID PCR sample demonstrates, by currently recognized standards, he is no longer considered a transmission risk to others,"" Dr. Sean Conley said in the memorandum[11].Since Trump is 10 days out from when his symptoms were first noticed and hasn't had a fever for 24 hours, Conley said there's no evidence the president could spread the virus.But the memo did not explicitly say whether the president tested negative for coronavirus. 
And it's still not known Trump last tested negative, leading to ongoing questions about when the White House was aware the president was infected.The CDC says[12] some people may need to quarantine for up to 20 days depending on the severity of the illness. The guidance also says people can be in public 10 days after symptoms first began, 24 hours without a fever without using medicines, and as other symptoms are improving, such as loss of taste and smell.It is not clear which, if any, symptoms Trump may still have, nor what medications he may or may not be taking.Conley wrote that all of Trump's symptoms were ""improved.""In his first public event since becoming sick with coronavirus, Trump spoke to hundreds of supporters from the group Blexit, founded by conservative activist Candace Owens to encourage Black and brown voters to reject the Democrat party and support Trump. Owens paid for some rally-goers' travel and lodging, according to an ABC News report[13].Crowded in front of the White House, the group gathered, many without masks and with little apparent attempt to social distance. The attendees were fenced in rather than given the space to spread out throughout the sweeping lawn, photographs show.

162,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_751/Files (250).DOCX","CNN Wire",2020-08-19,"867 words",NA,NA,NA,"Hits and misses from Night 2 of the Democratic National Convention",FALSE," (CNN) -- The second night of the 2020 Democratic National Convention is over.
The oddness of the all-virtual gathering was slightly less jarring than on the opening night (or maybe I was just more used to it). Old hands like Bill Clinton were mixed with young stars like New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in a series of virtual speeches. It was, overall, a markedly better two hours than I witnessed on Monday night.
Below the best -- and worst -- of the night that was.
HITS
* The McCain video: I am a rarely swayed by a Republican speaking at a Democratic convention (or vice versa). But the video -- narrated by Cindy McCain -- documenting the longtime friendship of John McCain and Joe Biden was extremely well done and reinforced a central message of Biden's presidential campaign: He is someone with the willingness and ability to work across the aisle -- someone who believes more in people than partisan labels. Hearing McCain's voice again was both haunting and uplifting, and a reminder that politics can be a good thing.
*Ady Barkan: The story of the young father afflicted with ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease) is well-known, but no less powerful for it. The video of Barkan playing with his young child, the voiceover of him explaining why he is fighting so hard on health care -- it was a hugely powerful, emotional and human moment.
* Jill Biden: She isn't Michelle Obama. But, well, no one is. Jill Biden did what she needed to in her speech -- she told the Biden story (a life marked by both tragedy and resilience) in a way that no one else could. Her testimonial to her husband's faith and how he leaned on it to get him through the hardest of times was important, too, disrupting the narrative pushed by President Donald Trump that the former vice president doesn't care about God. Plus, I liked the Biden cameo and the ""I'm Jill Biden's husband!"" introduction. A little hokey, sure. But that's what conventions are!
* Jacquelyn Brittany: Having the New York Times elevator operator who went viral when she told Biden that she loved him when he came by the paper to interview with the editorial board was a stroke of genius. And her words about Biden -- ""in the short time I spent with Joe Biden, I could tell he really saw me"" -- were a powerful testimonial to the Democratic nominee's humanity and empathy.
* The state roll call vote: There isn't much about a virtual convention that is better than the real thing. But the state roll call vote -- which serves to formally nominate the presidential nominee -- is one of them. It was fun to see what every state chose as its background -- Rhode Island with a chef standing off to the side with a plate of calamari was the BEST -- and who each state chose to deliver the votes to Joe Biden (and Bernie Sanders). (Khizr Khan, a Gold Star dad attacked by Trump during the 2016 race, and the parents of Matthew Shepard, who was killed in anti-gay hate crime, were particularly powerful choices.) And for a country that has been forced by Covid-19 to stay close to home for months, it was like a mini-trip around the country that I at least found hugely refreshing. And I wasn't the only one.
* John Legend: Dude is just plain talented. Also: How many people can pull off the white suit with a black turtleneck? Not I.
MISSES
* Bill Clinton: The former president has spoken at every Democratic convention since 1980. And he is a former Democratic president of the United States. So it's not easy to tell him no. But for a party that has fully embraced the #MeToo movement and is leaning on women to beat Donald Trump, the image of Clinton was a jarring one. (You may remember that as President he has an extramarital affair with a White House intern.) Clinton didn't get much time to speak (five-ish minutes) and it was in the very early moments of the night's programming. But still...
* Chuck Schumer: I could just imagine the ever-media-aware Senate Majority Leader setting up the shot -- Statue of Liberty in the background! -- for his speech. Except that the statue was so blurry that you could barely recognize it. ""I love that the planned symbolism of the shot was ruined by the need for a wide aperture to light it,"" tweeted AJ Chavar, a video journalist (and former colleague of mine at The Washington Post). 
* Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Watching AOC deliver a 90-second nominating speech for Sanders in the first hour of the convention was sort of like going to a Yankees game and seeing Aaron Judge pinch-hit. It just felt sort of like a waste of talent. I understand that the Biden team didn't want AOC, a GOP lightning rod, to be front-and-center in a big primetime speech. But it felt like she could have been deployed in a much more effective way than she was.
* John Kerry: Meh. I mean, I understand the idea -- a former Democratic presidential nominee and Secretary of State using his perceived gravitas to help make the case that Donald Trump is dangerous to America's standing in the world. But another elder statesman of the Democratic old guard in a suit talking about why Trump is bad? In a decidedly senatorial tone? I could have done without it.

Minnesota, Washington D.C., Delaware, New York, Connecticut, Vermont, Washington, Oregon, Colorado, and Virginia saw the highest spikes, per DoubleVerify. Each state has experienced at least a 2.2 times increase in its own average rate for hate speech online. 
Real-world events tend to cause spikes in hate speech on the internet. Race-related controversies or violence, hate crimes and political events all tend to elicit more hate speech, DoubleVerify's VP of marketing Heather McKim tells Axios. ""This year, several primaries and debates saw spikes in hate speech,"" says McKim. For example, DoubleVerify found that fake news spiked in response to Iowa's botched Democratic caucus earlier this year. Hate speech was declining prior to the protests, McKim explains. ""Also interesting is that following the outbreak of the pandemic until George Floyd's death, we actually saw a pretty significant downward trend in hate speech overall."" How it works: DoubleVerify says it uses proprietary technology and artificial intelligence to ""identify and block ads from appearing alongside online hate speech."" It defines hate speech as content featuring ""biased or derogatory language or behaviors directed toward an individual or group, based on their race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or ability."" The big picture: The spikes in hateful content, especially as it related to race and violence, have put pressure on tech companies to take action. Last week, Axios reported[1] that the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM), an industry body consisting of the world's biggest advertising companies — including a few Big Tech companies — has agreed to try to define hate speech across the entire industry.""The move signified a new step by tech and advertising giants towards a collective approach toward hate speech, even though it's mostly a formality for now. In a note to advertisers, Facebook's VP of global marketing solutions Carolyn Everson said that the industry, via GARM, has settled on four areas in which it will take immediate action: definitions of harmful content like hate speech, measurement, audits and suitability controls. The group says they agree on 11 standard definitions of harmful content that had been recently agreed to by GARM's brand safety working group ""with immediate focus on Hate Speech + Acts of Aggression"" and plan to align on those definitions next month.In her note, Everson said she would be providing an update from Facebook about how the tech giant limits ads from appearing next to ""hate speech"" or ""acts of aggression."" She says that meetings have already taken place with Facebook's policy team and GARM on the issue. Yes, but: Tech platforms still maintain their right to more narrowly define and police hate speech individually.Our thought bubble: The entire internet, from Facebook and Google on down, is groaning under the weight of hateful posts. Pressed by concerned advertisers on one side and outraged users and employees on the other, tech's giants have tried to take countermeasures, but they haven't been able to keep up.

Espaillat Stands With House Democrats, Congressional Black Caucus Colleagues to Demand Justice",FALSE,"Rep. Adriano Espaillat, D-New York, issued the following news release:
Representative Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) announced support of the Justice in Policing Act, led by members of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC), which would take key steps to achieve transformational, structural change to combat the pattern of police violence:
The Justice in Policing Act aims to remove barriers to prosecuting police misconduct and recovering damages from officers who have violated civilians' rights, including by ending qualified immunity by law enforcement; demilitarize the police by limiting the transfer of military weaponry to state and local police departments; combat police brutality, including by requiring body and dashboard cameras, banning chokeholds, ending the use of no-knock warrants in drug cases and enacting steps to end racial profiling; step up pressure on the Justice Department to address systemic racial discrimination by law enforcement; and, officially make lynching a federal hate crime, as the House did in passing H.R. 35 earlier this year.
""I am proud to stand in unity and solidarity with my Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) colleagues to demand justice and call for an end to the police brutality and targeting of African Americans around the nation,"" said Rep. Adriano Espaillat (NY-13). ""I have long fought for communities of color in my district and will continue my fight for African American and Latino families to ensure all persons are treated equally under the law. Now is the time for systemic and transformational reform of America's policing system, to transition away from a policing-first model. The best anti-crime policies are anti-poverty policies, and we must invest in our communities to foster opportunity. If we fail to act and implement real change, history will judge us by our inaction and failure to ensure life, liberty and justice for all persons in our nation.""
Last week, Rep. Espaillat announced the Harlem Manifesto, a series of legislative policies to urge for the end of police brutality and targeting of African Americans throughout the nation. Additionally, Espaillat introduced the Denial of Rights Prevention and Accountability Act that would hold officers accountable in court for abuses committed under the color of the law, and create a new statute that would lower the mens rea bar from willful deprivation of rights to reckless deprivation of rights, thereby permitting prosecutors to successfully hold law enforcement officers liable for the deprivation of civil rights and liberties.
Espaillat legislative priorities he fought for and prioritized in his Harlem Manifesto that are included in CBC, House Democrats' Justice in Policing Act:
* Denial of Rights Prevention and Accountability Act - Congressman Espaillat introduced this bill, which changes the 18 U.S.C. Sec. 242 mens rea requirement from willfulness to recklessness, permitting prosecutors to successfully hold law enforcement accountable for the deprivation of civil rights and civil liberties.
* Eric Garner Excessive Use of Force Prevention Act - This bill prohibits and makes punishable the use of a chokehold or any maneuvers that restrict the flow of blood or oxygen to the brain.
* Ending Qualified Immunity Act - This bill explicitly states that the judicial theory of qualified immunity is not a defense to liability, ensuring that the courts can't let police officers off the hook for civil charges in cases constitutional violations.
* Police Exercising Absolute Care with Everyone (PEACE) Act - This bill changes the use of force standard for officers to require that force must be necessary, as a last resort, to prevent imminent death or serious bodily injury, and no reasonable alternatives were available.
* Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act - This bill prohibits the Defense Department from transferring military weapons to state and local law enforcement agencies.
* Law Enforcement Trust and Integrity Act - This bill creates accreditation standards to ensure compliance with approved practices and transparency within the community.
* Police CAMERA Act - This bill requires all law enforcement officers to wear body cameras and prohibit the seizure of cell phones or other recording devices used to document police interactions without a person's consent or a warrant.

167,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_751/Files (250).DOCX","Orissa TV",2020-06-28,"1197 words",NA,NA,NA,"To Appease Muslim Voters, Democratic Presidential Nominee Joe Biden Raises Kashmir In Religious Context",FALSE,"Bhubaneswar, June 28 -- New York: In an openly communal appeal to Muslim voters, Joe Biden, the Democratic Party candidate for President, has dragged Kashmir into his campaign in a religious context rather than as a foreign policy or a general human rights issue.
His ""Agenda for Muslim American Communities"" published by his campaign also criticises the Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens.
Biden is assured of being formally nominated by the Democrats as its candidate at the party's national convention in August to challenge President Donald Trump in the November election as he has won the required delegates in the primary elections.
Unlike in India, parties are allowed to openly appeal to voters on the basis of religion.
Turning what are foreign policy or general human rights matters into a religious issue, Biden's Muslim agenda says: ""In Kashmir, the Indian government should take all necessary steps to restore rights for all the people of Kashmir. Restrictions on dissent, such as preventing peaceful protests or shutting or slowing down the Internet, weaken democracy.""
Turning to other contentious issues, the agenda, which is the basis for outreach to Muslim voters, says: ""Joe Biden has been disappointed by the measures that the government of India has taken with the implementation and aftermath of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam and the passage of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) into law.
""These measures are inconsistent with the country's long tradition of secularism and with sustaining a multi-ethnic and multi-religious democracy.""
While criticising the CAA, Biden's Muslim agenda, however, is silent on a US legislation similar to the CAA. Tucked into the US budget bill, the Specter Amendment excludes Muslim refugees from Iran from getting preferential asylum as religious refugees.
The Biden campaign has not issued so far an agenda for Hindu-Americans or Sikh-Americans or Buddhist-Americans.
But separately, Biden has taken up the issue of persecution of Hindus and Sikhs in Afghanistan.
After a terror attack on a gurdwara in Kabul killed at least 25 Sikhs in March, Biden issued a statement expressing concern over the ""intense persecutions of the members of the two religions in Afghanistan and urged the State Department to consider refugee protection for them.
Trump officials have declined to make a commitment to allowing Sikhs and Hindus in Afghanistan coming to the US as refugees to avoid persecution.
Biden's Agenda for Asian American and Pacific Islander Communities, which is not religiously-oriented, mentioned Hindus and Sikhs, along with Muslims, as victims of ""discrimination and hate"" in the US and said the situation was made worse by ""Trump's dangerous rhetoric"".
The Muslim agenda noted that the administration of former President Barack Obama in which he was the Vice President began to separately monitor hate crimes against Hindus and Sikhs.
It said that the Obama-Biden administration ""added 'Anti-Sikh' and 'Anti-Hindu' to the Department of Justice's hate crime reporting categories"".
It said ""his (Biden's) Justice Department will prioritise prosecuting hate crimes"".
But the Obama-Biden administration had failed to act on anti-Hindu hate crimes like the placing of a severed cow's head at a Hindu cow sanctuary in 2016 in Pennsylvania.
Biden's focus on Kashmir, the CAA and the NRC is driven by the ascendancy of the left in the Democratic Party, which is led by House of Representatives members like Pramila Jayapal, Ilhan Omar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortes.
Ocasio-Cortes has tried to link US arms sales to India with communal violence. She tweeted: ""President Trump is engaging in arms deals with Modi while his administration is ethnically cleansing the country's religious minorities. We must not enable this rise in sectarian violence.""
Jayapal and Omar have been at the forefront of the criticism of India in Congress.
A Hindu member of the campaign has been attacked personally and Biden has been asked to remove him because he is considered sympathetic to Modi and his father, according to some media reports, was linked to the Overseas Friends of the BJP.
But Amit Jani, the Asian American Pacific Islander outreach director for the Biden campaign continues so far on the job.
An organisation called Equity Labs published an open letter that said: ""To hire a supporter and friend of Narendra Modi opens the door to embracing anti-Muslim and Hindu nationalist politics.
""Progressive Asian Americans and South Asian Americans cannot stand by a candidate with relationships to fascists, here or abroad.""
A Change.org online petition calling for Jani's removal received 6,668 signatures as of Saturday night.
Such pressures would make it difficult for Biden, if he is elected, to work with India in the global context, even when the interests of the two countries intersect.
How the pressures from the left would translate into Biden policy is an open question and will have to await a better and comprehensive articulation of his foreign policy.
According to the Pew Research Center, Muslims make up 0.9 per cent of the US population and Hindus 0.7 per cent.
Although their numbers are not that far apart, Muslims exert more open influence in the Democratic Party for two reasons: African-Americans, a group that is important in the party and vocal make up an important segment of American Muslims, and the party's left-wing that is very articulate and increasing in importance is both pro-Muslim and critical of India.
BJP Vice President Jay Panda had also condemned Joe Biden's agenda.
"" With respect Vice President JoeBiden do you realise that the ""rights"" now taken away included the right to child marriage, the right to discriminate against former 'untouchables,' the right to deny property ownership by women, & many such horrors? Rather than being woke, wake up,"" tweeted Panda.

The Democratic Party has not made overt overtures to Hindus as it has to other religious groups.
On the other hand, Trump attended a Hindu Republican rally during his 2016 campaign. One of the sessions of the Republican National Convention that nominated him opened with a Sikh prayer.
The State Department has expressed concerns about the detentions and other restrictions in Kashmir, but in a non-religious context while also acknowledging India's democracy.

In May, New York-based Jewish non-governmental organisation the Anti-Defamation League reported that 2019 had been the worst year in terms of anti-Semitic attacks across the US since the group began keeping records in 1979.
The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has apologised for tweeting a link to a 139-page selection of the agency's files on ""The Protocols of the Elders of Zion"", a fabricated anti-Semitic text that accuses Jews of world domination.
In a series of tweets, the agency explained that the early 20th century document was published ""via an automated process"" that sends links to records that have been made public via Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.
Earlier today FOIA materials were posted to the FBI's Vault and FOIA Twitter account via an automated process without further outlining the context of the documents. We regret that this release may have inadvertently caused distress among the communities we serve.
— FBI Records Vault (@FBIRecordsVault) August 19, 2020
""The FBI often receives information from members of the public, which is captured in our permanent files and released under FOIA law. The FBI must process historical files that were collected in the past, some of which may be considered offensive"", the agency added.
The remarks came as international Jewish non-governmental organisation the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) berated the FBI for failing to note that the document is ""virulently anti-Semitic"" when extending its apologies.
""We have already received reports from many in the American Jewish community who are hurt by the irresponsible way this document was released. We call on the FBI to correct this mistake now, and do better in the future"", the organisation said in a statement on Friday.
The Auschwitz Memorial and Museum, for its part, expressed regret over the FBI tweeting the document, adding that ""the context of the antisemitic hoax is there, deep inside the documents; context really matters"".
In mid-May 2020, the ADL reported that there were at least 2,107 hate crimes committed against Jewish people across the US in 2019, the highest the number since the organisation began tallying anti-Semitic crimes in 1979.
The Protocols of the Elders of Zion were first published in Russia in 1903, translated into multiple languages and then disseminated internationally. The document, which was allegedly written by a Tsarist official, claimed that Jewish leaders were plotting to control the world.

Twenty-year-old Eileen Huang is an English major at Yale University. Growing up in a Chinese immigrant family in a small town in New Jersey, racism in the United States was a topic she rarely discussed with her parents.
But earlier this month, her open letter, ""A Letter from a Yale student to the Chinese American Community"" provoked a rare debate in the Chinese community in the U.S. and on Chinese social media.
Since George Floyd, a 46-year-old African American, died in police custody in late May, protests against racism have spread across communities throughout the United States, changing attitudes among millions of Americans about the legacy of slavery and discrimination that still impacts Black Americans.
According to a recent survey by the Pew Research Center, nearly 70% of Americans now support the Black Lives Matter movement and 69% of respondents said they had spoken to others about race in the past month.
Both political parties in Congress have also introduced bills aimed at reforming the police system.
For many first-generation Chinese immigrant families and Asian immigrant families, racism in the U.S. was not something that was regularly discussed, according to some Chinese American activists. But that has been changing recently.
Wally Ng, a member of the Guardian Angels, patrols with other members in Chinatown during the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in New York City, New York, U.S., May 16, 2020.
A younger generation of Chinese Americans like Huang has started to talk about racism with their immigrant parents. Huang was one of the first ones who spoke up publicly.
""I really couldn't get that image out of my mind,"" Huang said, referring to Floyd's death after a police officer kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes. ""So I was just moved to write this letter. I really couldn't stay silent about these protests.""
In her open letter, she expressed her disappointment at the indifference shown by the Chinese community after Floyd's death and encouraged people to actively understand the history of minorities in the U.S. The letter was signed by more than 20 Chinese and Asian students.
In the letter she wrote: ""What has happened to George Floyd has happened to Chinese miners in the 1800s and Vincent Chin, and will continue to happen to us and all minorities unless we let go of our silence, which has never protected us, and never will.""
Vincent Chin was the victim of a racial hate crime in the 1980s. At that time, the auto industry in Detroit, America's Motor City, was struggling in the face of competition from Japan.
On June 19, 1982, a white father and son killed Chinese American Vincent Chin with a baseball bat in a parking lot, claiming that someone like him had caused the father and son to lose their jobs. In the end, the father and son were fined $3,000 but spent no time in jail.
Huang's parents came to the U.S. as PhD and master's students in the early 1990s. At the time, the couple encountered episodes of discrimination, but didn't show much concern as their top priority was to create a good living environment for their children.
""In fact, we don't have the knowledge that our children have about the history of Chinese Americans, African Americans in the U.S. We didn't pay much attention to it,"" said Huang's mother, who didn't want to reveal her name. ""A lot of parents should really look at the history of the country that they emigrated to, some things about society.""
Huang hopes her action in writing the letter will spur a discussion that will help Chinese immigrants to fill that gap.
Huang's open letter received a lot of support but also provoked a heated online debate within the Chinese community. Some argued that Chinese Americans are not as indifferent as Huang described because they also participated in the civil rights movement fighting for equality. Others insisted that differences between African Americans and Chinese Americans both economically and socially were due to behavioral differences arguing that African Americans don't work as hard.
One of Huang's supporters Kalos Chu, a student at Harvard University argued that such claims are narrow minded.
""As hard-working as Chinese Americans are, I think it would be presumptuous to claim hard work as an exclusively Chinese cultural value,"" Chu wrote in a response to Huang's letter. ""I think it would be narrow-minded to think that Black people don't want to send their kids to good schools, don't want good lives for their families, or don't want to be self-reliant as well.""
After Huang's open letter was published, she and her parents had more conversations about racism, and together they discussed their previous anti-Black sentiments and began to read more to make up for their lack of knowledge.
Not long ago, Huang's parents joined her and participated in a protest against police violence. Her father said, ""The vast majority of the protesters were peaceful. The protesters were composed of people of all races... The reaction of the mainstream society really surprised me.""
Huang also has started writing articles about social issues in the U.S. including stories about police and the justice system as well as affirmative action.
""I just think it's really important for elders and older generations to hear from the people they've raised,"" she said.

As we near the end of Pride Month, we are taking a moment to reflect on LGBTQ+ equality past and present.
Pride Month is still not officially recognized internationally, but it is an important time of remembrance and celebration for the LGBTQ+ community all over the world.
While Pride celebrations began long ago, the 1969 Stonewall Uprising was a turning point for the LGBTQ+ movement, especially in the United States. This uprising was in response to a police raid on the Stonewall Inn in New York City. Back then, police harassment of gay and lesbian bars was extremely common, but one night in 1969, the patrons of the Stonewall Inn had finally had enough. The resulting demonstrations, led by LGBTQ+ activists like Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, numbered in the thousands of supporters and marked the genesis of the modern Pride movement in the United States.
Over half a century later, LGBTQ+ Americans are still fighting for full equality, and each year June brings marches, parades and all manner of celebration across the nation.
In Indiana, the path to LGBTQ+ equality has been particularly rocky. As recently as 2014, the General Assembly voted to ban same-sex marriages. Just one year later, the now infamous Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) was signed into law by then-governor Mike Pence, which allowed for state-sanctioned discrimination against LGBTQ+ Hoosiers under the guise of ""religious freedom"". It even took the legislature four whole years to finally pass a hate crimes law, and even after all that, transgender individuals are still left without protection under this law.
Despite this, there has been a lot of progress since Stonewall. In 2015, after decades of state-level bans of same-sex marriages, the United States Supreme Court effectively legalized same-sex marriage, and just last week the Supreme Court ruled once and for all, that the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act protects workers from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.
All 50 states have now elected openly LGBTQ+ people to political offices, including two United States Senators, nearly a dozen House Representatives, one governor and dozens more state legislators, including our very own State Senator J.D. Ford (D-Indianapolis) who was the first (and currently only) LGBTQ+ member of the Indiana General Assembly.
No LGBTQ+ person has ever held the office of President, Vice President or Supreme Court Justice, but just last year, Indiana's own Pete Buttigieg became the first openly LGBTQ+ person to launch a major presidential campaign.
Equality for our LGBTQ+ community has been a long, difficult road, and the fight is far from over. Our Indiana Senate Democratic Caucus is committed to continuing to stand up for equality and eventually equity for LGBTQ+ Hoosiers in every way possible, including but not limited to:
Pushing to end health care discrimination against transgender individuals
Banning housing discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community
Addressing the alarming rates of violence against transgender people, especially transgender women of color
Finally passing a comprehensive and fully-inclusive hate crimes bill
We cannot win this fight alone. We must build on the work of those before us on the long march towards justice, equality and equity. We must learn to accept and embrace the fact that our differences make us stronger.
As always, we urge everyone, especially members of the LGBTQ+ community, to get involved in the political process. In the words of the late Harvey Milk, Rights are won only by those who make their voices heard.

It was the classic vice presidential task: attending a funeral, representing the White House in expressing official grief for the passing of a celebrated person. But for former Vice President Joe Biden, who gave a poignant speech to mourners of George Floyd Tuesday, the appearance was about Biden's idea of what should be, both for African Americans and for the leadership in the White House. 
""I know you have a lot of questions that no child should have to ask, questions that too many black children have had to ask for generations. Why? Why is Daddy gone?"" Biden said softly, addressing Floyd's daughter, Gianna. 
""In looking through your eyes, we should all be asking ourselves why the answer is often too cruel and painful,"" Biden added in videotaped remarks shown to a Houston church packed with masked mourners. ""Why, in this nation, do too many black Americans -- wake up knowing they could lose their life -- in the course of living their life? 
""Ladies and gentlemen, we've got to deal with the denial of the promise of this nation to so many people for so long. This is about who we are, what we believe, and maybe most important, who we want to be,"" the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said. 
""Now is the time for racial justice. That's the answer we must give to our children when they ask 'why.' Because when there is justice for George Floyd, we will truly be on our way to racial justice,"" Biden said. ""And then, as you said Gianna, your daddy will have changed the world."" 
[READ:The Unprecendented Nature of the George Floyd Protests]
The former vice president's appearance was unusual in many ways. The sitting vice president, Mike Pence, did not attend, a sign of the tension between the family and the White House following Floyd's death and the protests against police brutality and racism that have occurred across the country in the two weeks since. 
Former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton sent presidential messages honoring Floyd's life; President Donald Trump, who reportedly had a short call with the family last week did not send an official message. 
Biden didn't mention his campaign or Trump. The former vice president met with the Floyd family in Houston Monday, but citing the disruption and Secret Service presence that comes with a presidential candidate visit, did not attend the funeral in person, as the family's attorney said last week Biden would do. 
The funeral, the pastor noted at its start, was a celebration of the life of Floyd, who was called ""Big George"" by friends and honored with portraits and a video montage of Floyd and throngs of demonstrators across the country lamenting his death. 
But those eulogizing Floyd did not ignore the circumstances that brought them there -- the videotaped scene of a Minneapolis police officer who pressed his knee to Floyd's neck, not letting up even as Floyd declared ""I can't breathe,"" and called out for his late mother. 
""Someone said, 'Make America Great Again' -- but when has America ever been great?"" said an anguished Brooke Williams, Floyd's niece, referring to Trump's campaign slogan without mentioning the president's name. Her uncle's death was ""not just a murder, but a hate crime,"" she said, drawing applause. 
""His crime was that he was born black. That was his only crime,"" said Rep. Al Green, a Texas Democrat. He noted a piece of legislation the Congressional Black Caucus is offering would ban chokeholds, no-knock warrants and other police tactics. Green also called for a federal ""Department of Reconciliation"" to health the racial wounds of slavery, segregation and mistreatment by the criminal justice system. 
The family was also given a U.S. flag flown over the Capitol, courtesy of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California. 
Progressives have called for localities to ""defund the police,"" an approach Biden rejected in excerpts of an interview with CBS News aired Monday night. 
""No, I don't support defunding the police,"" Biden said. ""I support conditioning federal aid to police based on whether or not they meet certain basic standards of decency and honorableness and, in fact, are able to demonstrate they can protect the community and everybody in the community."" 
Biden's primary foe, Sen. Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, has also pushed back on the ""defunding"" idea, saying in an interview with The New Yorker that police departments need the money to properly pay and train officers. 
""Do I think we should not have police departments in America? No, I don't,"" Sanders said in the interview. ""There's no city in the world that does not have police departments. ... I didn't call for more money for police departments. I called for police departments that have well-educated, well-trained, well-paid professionals."" 
[READ:How Joe Biden Could Take Texas in the 2020 Election]
The ""defund the police"" call has become an attack slogan by some Republicans, who cast the protesters as anti-police radicals. Trump has repeatedly declared himself the ""law and order"" candidate, and has cast the civil unrest since Floyd's death as a choice between anarchy and order. 
While he did not mention Trump's name, the Rev. William Lawson, pastor emeritus at Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church, made an appeal to oust Trump. ""Is this going to be like any other movement -- a movement of anger and rage, and then back to business as usual?"" Lawson asked the congregation. 
""The prejudiced and the bigoted are not going to change, but we can do something to change them, and that's what I hope we will do. Obviously, the first thing we have to do is clean out the White House,"" Lawson said. 
""It will not end with this boy's death,"" he concluded. ""This movement will transform this corrupt world.""

During a four-hour service broadcast live on every major U.S. television network from a church in Floyd's boyhood home of Houston, family members, clergy and politicians exhorted Americans to turn grief and outrage at his death into a moment of reckoning for the nation.
The funeral followed two weeks of protests ignited by graphic video footage of Floyd, 46, handcuffed and lying face down on a Minneapolis street while an officer kneels into the back of his neck for nearly nine minutes. The video shows Floyd gasping for air as he cries out, ""Mama,"" and groans, ""Please, I can't breathe,"" before falling silent and still.
The officer, Derek Chauvin, 44, has since been charged with second-degree murder and three other officers with aiding and abetting Floyd's May 25 death. All were dismissed from the department a day after the incident.
Floyd's dying words have become a rallying cry for hundreds of thousands of protesters around the globe who have since taken to the streets, undaunted by the coronavirus pandemic, demanding justice for Floyd and an end to mistreatment of minorities by U.S. law enforcement.
""I can breathe. And as long as I'm breathing, justice will be served,"" Floyd's niece Brooklyn Williams declared in a eulogy that drew applause from mourners inside the Fountain of Praise Church. ""This is not just a murder but a hate crime.""
'BIG FLOYD'
Williams was one of several relatives and friends who addressed the service, remembering Floyd as a loving, larger-than-life personality. The memorial was punctuated by gospel music and a video montage of shared memories of the man affectionately known as ""Big Floyd.""
His younger brother, Terrence Floyd, spoke about awakening in the middle of the night in recent days traumatized by the memory of seeing his older sibling calling out for their mother as he lay dying.
His older brother, Philonise, sobbing in grief, told mourners, ""George was my personal superman.""
Civil rights activist the Rev. Al Sharpton called Floyd ""an ordinary brother"" who grew up in a housing project but left behind a legacy of greatness despite rejections in jobs and sports that prevented him from achieving all that he once aspired to become.
""God took the rejected stone and made him the cornerstone of a movement that is going to change the whole wide world,"" Sharpton said, invoking a biblical parable from the New Testament.
Sharpton said the Floyd family would lead a march on Washington being organized for Aug. 28 to mark the 57th anniversary of the 1963 ""I Have a Dream"" speech given from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial by civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., who was assassinated in 1968.
'HOME-GOING CELEBRATION'
Some 2,500 people attended the funeral, after more than 6,000 people filed past Floyd's open casket on Monday.
Two columns of uniformed Houston police officers saluted the golden casket as it was wheeled from the hearse into the church before the service. A horse-drawn carriage later bore the coffin on its last mile to the cemetery in Pearland, Texas, where Floyd was buried in a private ceremony.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate in the Nov. 3 election, addressed the funeral service via a video recording, lamenting that ""too many black Americans wake up knowing that they could lose their life in the course of just living their life.""
""We must not turn away. We cannot leave this moment thinking we can once again turn away from racism,"" he said.
Two voter registration tables were set up outside the church.
MOURNING FAMILIES
Among those in attendance were loved ones of several other black men killed by white police or white civilians.
The mother of Eric Garner, the New York man who died in a police chokehold in 2014, was present, as was the family of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Georgia man who was shot and killed in February while jogging. Three white men were charged in his death.
Fallout from Floyd's death, and reaction to a spate of arson and looting that accompanied some of the otherwise mostly peaceful protests, also plunged President Donald Trump into one of the biggest crises of his tenure.
Hundreds of protesters packed Seattle's city hall late Tuesday night, chanting demands for the resignation of the mayor and the defunding the police force.
Days after Seattle's mayor and police chief promised a month-long moratorium on tear gas, the department used it again on protesters overnight Sunday, bringing severe criticism.
A Republican, Trump repeatedly threatened to order the military onto the streets to quell protests, focusing on restoring order while saying little about the U.S. racial wounds at the root of the upheavals.

Sunday, a noose was found in Wallace's garage at Talladega Superspeedway in Lincoln, Alabama. It's a classic Alabama greeting:[1] More than 300 Black people were lynched in the state between 1877 and 1943. This is likely a grotesque response to Wallace successfully advocating for the ban of Confederate flags[2] at NASCAR tracks and facilities. NASCAR officials were shocked[3] and appalled that there were racists in their fine establishment. 
""Late this afternoon, NASCAR was made aware that a noose was found in the garage stall of the 43 team. We are angry and outraged, and cannot state strongly enough how seriously we take this heinous act,"" NASCAR said in a statement. ""We have launched an immediate investigation, and will do everything we can to identify the person(s) responsible and eliminate them from the sport."" An Alabama native, Wallace had for years focused solely on racing. According to a profile in the New York Times[4], he didn't try to ""disturb the culture of a sport whose fan base remains predominantly white and conservative."" He wasn't a stranger to racism, however. When Wallace was 13, a NASCAR driver's parent and a race official called him a racial slur. Wallace is 26, so we're talking about the distant past of 2007.Wallace concentrated on winning, on being the best, and ignored racist attacks from critics. He modeled his career more after Tiger Woods than Colin Kaepernick, but that changed when Ahmaud Arbery[5] was murdered while out for a jog. After he saw the gut-wrenching video, he no longer cared about upsetting sponsors or 'fans."" Wallace said he stayed up that night to watch the video again and again. The idea seared into his brain, he said, that a black man, one who was just about his age, could be gunned down on a jog by white people who appeared to hunt him. He said he can still hear the gunshots in his head. The death broke his heart, he said, and opened his mind to the urgency of fighting for racial justice.George Floyd's murder not long afterward compelled him to speak out. First, he confronted his peers, who had remained silent while Americans protested against police violence. He asked them point-blank: ""Do you all not care about what's going on in the world?"" This led to two dozen top drivers, including Wallace, appearing in a video condemning racism and racial inequality. Wallace shared the video on Twitter with the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter, and suddenly NASCAR had demonstrated more awareness and leadership than the entire Trump administration. Wallace opened up about his own experiences with racial profiling, and how police officers had drawn guns on him because they didn't believe he owned the Lexus he was driving. He discussed the pain his mother felt when a white police officer killed his 19-year-old cousin, Sean Gillispie. The officer claimed Gillispie had a gun, but a witness said he was reaching for his cell phone. It's the same old story.Just two days after Wallace told CNN that he believed the Confederate flag represented 'hate not heritage"" and shouldn't be flown at races, NASCAR banned the flag. Wallace later drove his No. 43 Chevrolet -- Richard Petty's old number -- with Black Lives Matter logos on the vehicle.The noose has long been a white supremacist warning to Black 'troublemakers."" If whoever's responsible thought it would scare the Kaep out of Wallace, they were wrong. Wallace released a statement[6] on Twitter condemning the 'despicable act of racism"" that left him 'incredibly saddened"" but only reinforced how persistent 'we must be in the fight against racism.""Over the last several weeks, I have been overwhelmed by the support from people across the NASCAR industry, including other drivers and team members in the garage. Together, our sport has made a commitment to driving real change and championing a community that is accepting and welcoming of everyone. Nothing is more important and we will not be deterred by the reprehensible actions of those who seek to spread hate. As my mother told me today, ""They are just trying to scare you."" This will not break me, I will not give in nor will I back down. I will continue to proudly stand for what I believe in.I learned about this incident when 'Jussie"" was trending on Twitter. Idiots were suggesting that this was just another 'fake hate crime,""[7] an attempt to divide and make white people look bad. That noose wasn't a publicity stunt. It was a calling card for the racism that still exists and thrives in America. People have always wanted to 'stand athtwart history, yelling 'Stop!'"" But the courageous never listen. They just keep moving forward.[ESPN[8] / New York Times[9]] Follow Stephen Robinson on Twitter.[10]Do your Amazon shopping through this link, because reasons[11].Yr Wonkette is 100 percent ad free and entirely supported entirely by reader donations.

The U.S. Government's actions during the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic have caused serious human rights problems in the U.S., according to an article by the China Society for Human Rights Studies released on June 11. Edited excerpts follow:
The unexpected outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic is the most serious global public health emergency that humanity has experienced since the end of World War II. It is also a ""big test of human rights conditions"" for all countries across the globe. The virus does not respect borders, nor is race or nationality relevant in the face of the disease. Given this, to honor our common commitment to human rights, governments of different countries are obliged to adopt scientific measures for the prevention and control of the virus and do their best to ensure the health and safety of their people.
Nevertheless, the U.S. Government's self-interested, short-sighted, inefficient and irresponsible response to the pandemic has not only caused the tragedy in which over 2 million Americans have become infected and more than 110,000 died from it, but also exposed and worsened the long-existing problems within the U.S., such as a divisive society, the polarization between the rich and the poor, racial discrimination, and the inadequate protection of the rights and interests of vulnerable groups. This has led the American people into grave human rights disasters.
Ineffective response
Being distracted, slack and opinionated in the face of the pandemic, the United States Federal Government declared a national emergency on March 13, after tens of thousands of deaths had occurred. For the U.S., which boasts the strongest economic and technological strength and the most abundant medical resources in the world, this is a sad irony.
According to the revisited timeline of the pandemic in the U.S., which was released by The New York Times and Washington Post in April, the U.S. Government had repeatedly ignored the pandemic warnings and slacked off on pandemic control. Instead, it focused on controlling the spread of information, restricted medical experts' freedom to release information on the pandemic to the public, and even published false information to mislead the public, such as calling the virus ""a flu,"" claiming that the virus has low infection and fatality rates, and saying that ""one day, like a miracle, it will disappear.""
Under such circumstances, the ""golden window"" period for infectious disease prevention and control was wasted. Even then, many members of the U.S. Senate, including Richard Burr, who was the chairman of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, were involved in insider trading scandals. They used their positions to understand the serious situation of the pandemic earlier, but downplayed the risk of the pandemic in front of the public while selling a large number of stocks before the pandemic triggered a stock market crash.
When the virus broke out in the U.S., some U.S. politicians used it as a weapon to attack political opponents and seek election benefits instead of regarding the drive to protect the lives and health of their people as their top priority. The website of The Lancet, an authoritative medical journal, published an editorial on May 16, which was a rare case for the journal. The article criticized the U.S. Government for not actively adopting basic medical and anti-pandemic measures such as detection, tracking and isolation, placing its hopes on ""magic bullets"" such as vaccines and new drugs, and hoping that the virus would eventually ""magically disappear.""
On May 4, the famous U.S. political scientist Francis Fukuyama published an article titled The Wages of American Political Decay on the website of The National Interest, pointing out that the highly polarized party politics made the political checks and balances an insurmountable obstacle to decision-making; that the pandemic, which should have been an opportunity to put aside differences and show unity, further deepened the political polarization.
The website of The New York Times reported on May 20 that research by Columbia University showed that delays in adopting movement restrictions had caused at least 36,000 deaths. According to the research, if the U.S. Government had adopted movement restrictions one week earlier, it could have saved 36,000 lives, and if the U.S. Government had adopted movement restrictions two weeks earlier, 83 percent of the deaths from COVID-19 could have been avoided.

Inequality exposed
In the U.S., both liberal and conservative scholars agree on one basic fact that there is stark inequality within the U.S. society. The deep-seated institutional reason for such inequality is that the U.S. Government and political parties have long been manipulated by interest groups, and are unable to formulate and implement tax, industrial, and social security policies that promote social equality. During the pandemic, the social and economic inequality within the U.S. society has been exposed and exacerbated.
Viral infection does not distinguish between rich and poor, but the limited testing and medical resources were not fairly allocated in the U.S. The website of The New York Times reported on March 19 that many dignitaries in the U.S. somehow underwent virus testing when they had no signs of infection and when nearly every state in the country lacked testing equipment. This obvious injustice has led the public increasingly to raise questions. The website of The Guardian, a British newspaper, published an article on March 21 and commented that in the face of COVID-19, the United States has first rescued the rich and powerful groups. The gap between rich and poor in getting the virus tests in the U.S. has exposed the slackness, confusion and injustice in its pandemic prevention and control system.
The pandemic has made the lives of people at the bottom of the U.S. society increasingly difficult, and further intensified the social polarization between rich and poor. Faced with the COVID-19 pandemic, tens of millions of people in the U.S. are not covered by medical insurance, while intensive care for COVID-19 costs as high as tens of thousands of dollars.
According to data released by the U.S. Department of Labor on May 28, the cumulative number of Americans applying for unemployment relief from March 15 to May 23 for the first time reached 40.8 million. Given the high unemployment rate brought about by the pandemic and the long-existing structural discrimination and polarization between rich and poor, the U.S. working class' ability to resist risks has greatly diminished. According to a report released by the National Restaurant Association on April 20, two thirds of restaurant workers (about 8 million people) have been dismissed or sent on leave due to the pandemic. The U.S. working class was the first to feel the pain of the economic recession brought about by the pandemic, and became the victims of the U.S. Government's inefficient anti-pandemic measures.
Racial discrimination
Systemic racial discrimination is a chronic illness of the U.S. society. Since 2016, white supremacy has revived and racial discrimination has intensified. Social tensions brought about by the pandemic, especially the unequal allocation of limited anti-pandemic resources, have further deepened mainstream society's discrimination against minorities, such as Asian, African, and Hispanic Americans.
The website of The Guardian pointed out on April 1 that when reporting on the COVID-19 situation, some U.S. media always attached photos of Asian faces. The website of The New York Times observed on April 16 that the COVID-19 pandemic meant isolation for Asian Americans. Since the outbreak of the virus, Asian Americans have often been humiliated and even attacked in public places. Some U.S. politicians even deliberately misled the public. After the World Health Organization (WHO) officially named the new coronavirus COVID-19, senior U.S. leaders, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, still insisted on referring to the virus as the ""Chinese virus"" or ""Wuhan virus.""
The United Nations Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, Tendayi Achiume, pointed out on March 23 and April 21 that politicians have proactively expressed xenophobic opinions or made xenophobic implications by deliberately replacing COVID-19 with other names that linked this particular disease to a particular country or nation, which was an irresponsible and disturbing expression.
In the U.S., which bills itself as a ""beacon of freedom,"" government officials blatantly incite, guide, and condone racial discrimination, which is tantamount to humiliating the modern concept of human rights.
Violent incidents have further exacerbated the social tension during the pandemic, and problems such as a divisive society, racial divide, and the proliferation of guns have worsened. On April 15, nearly 200 U.S. foreign policy scholars and former diplomats jointly issued a statement in USA Today, pointing out that hate crimes and violent attacks against Asian Americans sounded the alarm for the U.S., and that leaders at all levels and in all sectors should take action to oppose racism against Asians and end hate crimes against Asian communities.
African Americans across the country are infected with and are dying from COVID-19 at a disproportionately higher rate than any other group in the U.S. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services released a racial breakdown of the state's confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths on April 2, which showed that African Americans, who make up only 12 percent of Michigan's population, accounted for 33 percent of Michigan's confirmed COVID-19 cases and 40 percent of the state's COVID-19 deaths. National statistics released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that as of May 13, African Americans accounted for 22.4 percent of deaths from COVID-19 in the United States.
Hispanic Americans also have disproportionately higher infection and fatality rates. In early April, New York City released a racial breakdown of the city's deaths from COVID-19. According to it, Hispanic Americans accounted for 34 percent of the city's fatal cases of COVID-19. The website of The New York Times pointed out on April 14 that the fact the pandemic infected and killed African and Hispanic Americans at disproportionately higher rates was the result of a health gap directly created by the historical inequality of wealth and opportunities. The website of Financial Times, a British newspaper, pointed out on May 15 that African Americans and Hispanic Americans were more likely than whites to perform the work that was necessary for the maintenance of social operations, making them more susceptible to poverty, diabetes, high blood pressure and COVID-19.
On May 25, George Floyd, an African-American man from Minnesota, died after a white police officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for several minutes during his arrest. This led to large-scale protests and demonstrations across the U.S., once again exposing the dissatisfaction and anger that Americans have for the worsening racial inequality.
Vulnerable groups' struggle
The care for the survival of socially disadvantaged and marginalized groups represents the virtue of a society. It is also a touchstone for the human rights situation in a country. During the pandemic, the features of the U.S.' cruel capitalism have been fully exposed, which have forced the elderly, homeless people and children into a tragic situation.
Unfortunately, during the epidemic in the U.S., the elderly who are naturally at greater risk have been further weakened and marginalized due to age discrimination, and their right to life has not been ensured. On March 23 and April 22, Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick told Fox News that he would rather die than see public health measures damage the U.S. economy and take the risk of restarting the U.S. economy at the cost of elderly people's lives. The website of The New York Times reported on May 11 that at least 28,100 occupants and staff members of long-term care institutions such as nursing homes in the U.S. have died of COVID-19, accounting for about one third of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S.
The homeless have nowhere to go during the pandemic. The website of USA Today reported on April 22 that more than 550,000 people were homeless every night in the U.S. Given their originally poor physical health and bad living and hygienic conditions, they are susceptible to the virus. During the epidemic, the homeless who are living on the streets are deported and forced to live in temporary shelters for isolation. Reuters reported on April 23 that the crowded shelters made it impossible for the homeless who lived there to practice social distancing, which made it easier for the virus to spread. The website of The New York Times reported on April 13
that the shelters for the homeless had become a delayed-action bomb of a virus outbreak in New York City, where more than 17,000 people lived and slept almost side by side in centralized shelters.
In recent years, child poverty and abuse has been a grave problem in the U.S., exacerbated by the pandemic. Forbes News reported on May 7 that a survey showed a large number of American children were facing hunger during the pandemic. As of the end of April, more than one fifth of American households had been facing food crises, and two fifths of American households with children under 12 have been facing such crises.
Apart from that, a more worrisome fact is that a large number of unaccompanied immigrant children are still being held in detention centers in the U.S. They are currently in an extremely dangerous situation. The website of the United Nations reported on May 21 that since March, the U.S. Government had repatriated at least 1,000 unaccompanied immigrant children to Central and South America regardless of the risk of the pandemic.
Violating international law
At a time when citizens' right to life and health is severely threatened by the spreading pandemic, the U.S. Government, instead of focusing on controlling the pandemic, wields a hegemonic stick and fans the flames everywhere, trying to divert attention and shirk responsibility. Its behavior has seriously undermined the international community's concerted efforts to control the pandemic.
Ineffective anti-pandemic efforts fail the national duty of ensuring citizens' right to life. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights stipulates that every human being has the inherent right to life, and countries are obliged to take proactive measures to guarantee their citizens' right to life. As a party to the convention, the U.S. Government, however, has not given priority to its citizens' right to life and health during the pandemic. Instead, it has been prioritizing the political campaign at home and the political drive to suppress China abroad. Given this, it has missed the best chance to curb the spread of the virus, and caused a grave human rights disaster.
Clearly, the U.S. Government has failed to fulfill its due national obligations to protect its people's lives from the threat of epidemics. The website of The Independent, a British newspaper, commented on April 10 that the U.S., an active advocator for human rights, ignored its own human rights obligations and blatantly overlooked its citizens' lives. The Huffington Post reported on May 6 that after making a rigorous assessment of the U.S. Government's poor performance during the COVID-19 pandemic, Yale University epidemiologist Gregg Gonsalves directly pointed out that this was getting awfully close to genocide by default.
In order to shirk its responsibility for its disastrous anti-pandemic measures, the U.S. Government tried to scapegoat WHO by fabricating false charges against the organization and threatening to stop paying its membership fees. On April 14, the U.S. Government announced suspension of its payment of dues to WHO, which was unanimously criticized by the international community. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres issued a statement on April 14 stating that when the world was fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, it was inappropriate to reduce the resources required by WHO or any other humanitarian organization for operations.
The President of the American Medical Association, Patrice Harris, issued a statement on April 15 stating that combating the pandemic required international cooperation and that the suspension of financial support to WHO at this critical moment is a dangerous step in the wrong direction. Josep Borrell, the European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, expressed on April 15 that at this time, there was no reason to justify such an action.
On April 15, the website of The Guardian, published an editorial and commented that when the world desperately needed to jointly overcome this threat that it had never experienced before, the suspension of WHO dues by the U.S. Government was an act that lacked morality, disrupted the international order, and was a betrayal of global solidarity. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on April 16 that WHO was the mainstay of the global fight against the pandemic, and the suspension of WHO dues ""would be nothing other than throwing the pilot out of the plane in mid-flight"". Under such circumstances, Pompeo once again attacked WHO on April 22, threatening to permanently suspend the payment of dues. On May 29, the president of the United States announced the suspension of relations with WHO.
U.S. unilateral sanctions violate the spirit of humanitarianism and the principle of international cooperation. International cooperation is the cornerstone of the existence and operation of the international community. It is an important principle for ensuring the implementation of human rights and fundamental freedoms across the globe. It is also a national obligation stipulated by international instruments, such as the Charter of the United Nations.
At this critical moment when the deadly pandemic spreads globally and threatens human life, health, and wellbeing, all countries should work together to respond to the pandemic and maintain global public health security. Nevertheless, during this pandemic, the U.S. Government has still imposed sanctions on countries such as Iran, Cuba and Venezuela, which made it difficult for the sanctioned countries to obtain needed anti-pandemic medical supplies in a timely manner, and posed threats to the people's rights to life and health in the sanctioned countries.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, expressed on March 24 that in the case of a global pandemic, sanctions would hinder medical work and increase risks for everyone. She argued that to maintain global public health security and protect the rights and lives of millions of people in sanctioned countries, sanctions should be relaxed or suspended in certain sectors.
The United Nations Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, the Special Rapporteur on human rights for safe drinking water and sanitation, and the Special Rapporteur on the right to education issued a joint statement on May 6 stating that the U.S. sanctions on Venezuela were seriously harming the human rights of the people in the country. They urged the U.S. to immediately lift sanctions that exacerbated the suffering of the people when the pandemic raged in the country."

It has been a stunning fall from grace for one of the President`s staunchest supporters. Here`s CBS` Jericka Duncan.

JERICKA DUNCAN: It`s the latest salacious headline involving the Falwells, this time a former Liberty University student tells Politico that Becki Falwell performed oral sex on him in 2008. Earlier this week, Jerry Falwell Jr. did acknowledge that his wife had an affair with a different man, Giancarlo Granda, a then-twenty-year-old pool attendant he says his wife met at the Fontainebleau hotel in Miami Beach.
GIANCARLO GRANDA: She invited me back to the hotel room.
JERICKA DUNCAN: In an interview with CBS, Granda, who is now twenty-nine, says the affair began the day he met Becki at the pool.
GIANCARLO GRANDA: I`m twenty years old, single, I didn`t really think anything of it. And then she said, by the way, my husband likes to watch.
JERICKA DUNCAN: It`s the type of lewd behavior that is prohibited at Liberty University.
Just curious, if they ever took you to church with them.
GIANCARLO GRANDA: Well, actually, we never really spoke about religion. Religion really, to him, wasn`t-- it just wasn`t that big of a deal.
JERICKA DUNCAN: One of the things that Jerry Falwell Jr. said is it`s an election year and he expected this to happen.
GIANCARLO GRANDA: Well, let me make it clear, there is no political motivation whatsoever. He is just trying to deflect and spin it.
JERICKA DUNCAN: Did you fear the Falwells?
GIANCARLO GRANDA: They have, you know, the President on speed dial. They have people behind the scenes that can spin and manipulate stories. So, yes, I was-- I was afraid.
JERICKA DUNCAN: But the Falwells maintain this is all about extortion.
GIANCARLO GRANDA: I mean, it`s ridiculous to think that the-- the twenty- year-old working at the Fontainebleau hotel was preying upon this power couple.

NORAH O`DONNELL: And there is still much more news ahead on tonight`s CBS EVENING NEWS. The deal that got NBA teams back on the court, and how it could affect the presidential election.
And a Jewish student center up in flames on a college campus. Why arson is suspected.
(ANNOUNCEMENTS)
NORAH O`DONNELL: The NBA play-offs resume tomorrow after team owners and players worked out a deal to create a social justice coalition to push for change. Several teams have also agreed to open their arenas as polling places in the November election. Players walked off this week to protest the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin.
Officials say a fire that damaged a Jewish-- Jewish student center this week at the University of Delaware was deliberately set. But for now, they`re not calling it a hate crime. No one was injured. Students launched a GoFundMe page to repair the estimated two hundred thousand dollars in damages.
And there`s still much more ahead. On the Road is next. In sixty-three years, he`s never given her a better anniversary present than this one.

During a four-hour service broadcast live on every major U.S. television network from a church in Floyd's boyhood home of Houston, family members, clergy and politicians exhorted Americans to turn grief and outrage at his death into a moment of reckoning for the nation.
The funeral followed two weeks of protests ignited by graphic video footage of Floyd, 46, handcuffed and lying face down on a Minneapolis street while an officer kneels into the back of his neck for nearly nine minutes. The video shows Floyd gasping for air as he cries out, ""Mama,"" and groans, ""Please, I can't breathe,"" before falling silent and still.
The officer, Derek Chauvin, 44, has since been charged with second-degree murder and three other officers with aiding and abetting Floyd's May 25 death. All were dismissed from the department a day after the incident.
Floyd's dying words have become a rallying cry for tens of thousands of protesters around the globe who have since taken to the streets, undaunted by the coronavirus pandemic, demanding justice for Floyd and an end to mistreatment of minorities by U.S. law enforcement.
""I can breathe. And as long as I'm breathing, justice will be served,"" Floyd's niece Brooklyn Williams declared in a eulogy that drew applause from mourners inside the Fountain of Praise Church in Houston. ""This is not just a murder but a hate crime.""
'BIG FLOYD'
Williams was one of several relatives and friends, most dressed all in white, who addressed the service, remembering Floyd as a loving, larger-than-life personality. The memorial was punctuated by gospel music and a video montage of shared memories of the man affectionately known as ""Big Floyd.""
His younger brother, Terrence Floyd, spoke about awakening in the middle of the night in recent days traumatized by the memory of seeing his older sibling calling out for their mother as he lay dying.
His older brother, Philonise, sobbing in grief, told mourners, ""George was my personal superman.""
Taking the stage to deliver the main eulogy, the Rev. Al Sharpton, a prominent civil rights activist and television commentator, called Floyd ""an ordinary brother"" who left behind a legacy of greatness despite shortcomings that prevented him from achieving all that he once aspired to become.
""God took the rejected stone and made him the cornerstone of a movement that is going to change the whole wide world,"" Sharpton said.
He added that the Floyd family would lead a march on Washington being organized for Aug. 28 to mark the 57th anniversary of the 1963 ""I Have a Dream"" speech given from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial by civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., assassinated in 1968.
'HOME-GOING CELEBRATION'
Some 2,500 people attended the funeral, which followed memorial services last week in Minneapolis, where Floyd made his home after leaving Houston, and Raeford, the North Carolina town where he was born. More than 6,000 people filed past Floyd's open casket on Tuesday as he lay in repose inside the church.
""This is a home-going celebration,"" the Rev. Mia Wright, co-pastor of the church, told mourners. Banners featured pop art illustrations of Floyd wearing a baseball cap with a halo above it.
Two columns of uniformed Houston police officers saluted the golden casket as it was wheeled from the hearse into the church before the service. A horse-drawn carriage later bore the coffin on its last mile to the cemetery in Pearland, Texas, where Floyd was buried in a private grave-side ceremony.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate in the Nov. 3 election, addressed the funeral service via a video recording, lamenting that ""too many black Americans wake up knowing that they could lose their life in the course of just living their life.""
""We must not turn away. We cannot leave this moment thinking we can once again turn away from racism,"" he said.
Two voter registration tables were set up outside the church.
MOURNING FAMILIES
Among those in attendance were loved ones of several other black men killed by white police or white civilians.
The mother of Eric Garner, the New York man who died in a police chokehold in 2014, was present, as was the family of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Georgia man who was shot and killed in February while jogging. Three white men were charged in his death.
But it was the chillingly graphic video rendering of Floyd's death that triggered an outpouring of rage like no other such killing in recent memory, energizing the Black Lives Matter movement and thrusting demands for racial justice to the top of the political agenda in the United States and around the world.
Fallout from Floyd's death, and reaction to a spate of arson and looting that accompanied some of the otherwise mostly peaceful protests, also plunged President Donald Trump into one of the biggest crises of his tenure.
A Republican, Trump repeatedly threatened to order the military onto the streets to quell protests, focusing on restoring order while saying little about the U.S. racial wounds at the root of the upheavals.

Two columns of uniformed Houston police officers saluted the golden casket as it was wheeled from the hearse into the church before the service. A horse-drawn carriage later bore the coffin on its last mile to the cemetery in Pearland, Texas, where Floyd was buried in a private ceremony.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate in the Nov. 3 election, addressed the funeral service via a video recording, lamenting that ""too many black Americans wake up knowing that they could lose their life in the course of just living their life.""
""We must not turn away. We cannot leave this moment thinking we can once again turn away from racism,"" he said.
Two voter registration tables were set up outside the church.
MOURNING FAMILIES
Among those in attendance were loved ones of several other black men killed by white police or white civilians.
The mother of Eric Garner, the New York man who died in a police chokehold in 2014, was present, as was the family of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Georgia man who was shot and killed in February while jogging. Three white men were charged in his death.
Fallout from Floyd's death, and reaction to a spate of arson and looting that accompanied some of the otherwise mostly peaceful protests, also plunged President Donald Trump into one of the biggest crises of his tenure.
Hundreds of protesters packed Seattle's city hall late Tuesday night, chanting demands for the resignation of the mayor and the defunding the police force.
Days after Seattle's mayor and police chief promised a month-long moratorium on tear gas, the department used it again on protesters overnight Sunday, bringing severe criticism.
A Republican, Trump repeatedly threatened to order the military onto the streets to quell protests, focusing on restoring order while saying little about the U.S. racial wounds at the root of the upheavals.

During a four-hour service broadcast live on every major U.S. television network from a church in Floyd's boyhood home of Houston, family members, clergy and politicians exhorted Americans to turn grief and outrage at his death into a moment of reckoning for the nation.
The funeral followed two weeks of protests ignited by graphic video footage of Floyd, 46, handcuffed and lying face down on a Minneapolis street while an officer kneels into the back of his neck for nearly nine minutes. The video shows Floyd gasping for air as he cries out, ""Mama,"" and groans, ""please, I can't breathe,"" before falling silent and still.
The officer, Derek Chauvin, 44, has since been charged with second-degree murder and three other officers with aiding and abetting Floyd's May 25 death.
His dying words have become a rallying cry for tens of thousands of protesters around the globe who have since taken to the streets, undaunted by the coronavirus pandemic, demanding justice for Floyd and an end to mistreatment of minorities by U.S. law enforcement.
""I can breathe. And as long as I'm breathing, justice will be served,"" Floyd's niece Brooke Williams declared in a eulogy that drew applause from mourners inside the Fountain of Praise Church in Houston. ""This is not just a murder but a hate crime.""
'BIG FLOYD'
Williams was one of several relatives and friends, most dressed all in white, who addressed the service, remembering Floyd as a loving, larger-than-life personality. The memorial was punctuated by gospel music and a video montage of shared memories of the man affectionately known as ""Big Floyd.""
His younger brother, Terrence Floyd, spoke about awakening in the middle of the night in recent days traumatized by the memory of seeing his older sibling calling out for their mother as he lay dying.
Another brother, Philonise, sobbing in grief, told mourners, ""George was my personal superman.""
Taking the stage to deliver the main eulogy, the Reverend Al Sharpton, a prominent civil rights activist and television commentator, called Floyd ""an ordinary brother"" who left behind a legacy of greatness despite shortcomings that prevented him from achieving all that he once aspired to become.
""God took the rejected stone and made him the cornerstone of a movement that is going to change the whole wide world,"" Sharpton said.
He added that the Floyd family would lead a march on Washington being organized for Aug. 28 to mark the 57th anniversary of the 1963 ""I Have a Dream"" speech given from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial by slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., assassinated in 1968.

""This is a home-going celebration,"" the Rev. Mia Wright, co-pastor at the church, told mourners. Banners featured pop art illustrations of Floyd wearing a baseball cap with a halo above it.
American flags lined the streets outside the church. Flowers and bouquets were placed around a photograph of Floyd.

To this will be added a lighting event organized by the Fundación Igual in the Plaza Baquedano, which will be held at 19:00 hours and that has all the required permits.

The roll call vote that formally sealed Joe Biden's nomination as the Democratic candidate for president Tuesday came from sites in the 50 states and territories. Biden received votes from the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Alabama and from the parents of murdered hate crime victim Matthew Shepard in Wyoming.
It became a guessing game for viewers: Where will my state's delegates speak from? Washington Post editor Tanya Sichynsky tweeted that it was ""the most any of us have travelled in months.""
""It's like the Olympic parade of nations,"" tweeted NBC's Kasie Hunt, ""which I so missed this year.""
It made the ABC and CBS decisions to cut away from the roll call to show portions of former President Bill Clinton's address feel like old hat. None of Tuesday's speakers had the immediate impact of former First Lady Michelle Obama on Monday night.
The nomination was marked by a Zoom-like outbreak of applause and streamers tossed at Biden and his wife, Jill, as Kool & The Gang's ""Celebration"" played in the background.
""Not quite the same,"" said ABC's George Stephanopoulos.
Democrats have worked to produce a relentlessly theme-driven facsimile, but it still isn't a television event like past conventions. Television viewership for Monday's first night was sharply down compared with the opening of Hillary Clinton's nomination week in 2016.
An estimated 19.7 million people watched Monday's coverage between 10 and 11 p.m. on some 10 different television networks, the Nielsen company said. Four years ago, opening night drew just under 26 million viewers.
The Biden campaign claimed their event was a hit online, with campaign spokesman T.J. Ducklo saying an additional 10 million people streamed live video of the convention on various platforms. Those numbers could not immediately be independently verified.
Broadcast networks were hit hardest by the changed format. NBC's telecast drew 2.28 million viewers, down from 4.29 million four years ago, Nielsen said. ABC reached 2.44 million people on Monday, compared to 4.13 million.
The left-leaning MSNBC, where Rachel Maddow, Joy Reid and Nicolle Wallace were anchors, led the way Monday with 5.1 million viewers, up from four years ago. CNN had 4.78 million. Unlike the broadcasters, the two cable networks ran the Democrats' production nearly in its entirety.
Fox News Channel's audience was unimpressed; the 2.1 million viewers it reached for its hour of convention coverage compared poorly with the 3.4 million viewers that time slot occupant Laura Ingraham had on an average July day. Earlier in the evening, Fox kept to its regular lineup with Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity criticizing the Biden campaign, instead of showing news coverage of the convention.
Veteran television producer Don Mischer, whose credits include the Oscars, the Emmys and the 2004 Democratic national convention, said that while the convention's first night was well-produced, it suffered from the lack of a live audience.
While Obama ""hit a home run"" with her speech, ""had that been done in front of the crowd, with the crowd's emotion getting stronger and stronger as she went through that speech, by the time she got to the end, there would have been a rush of palpable emotion that would have resonated with people many times greater than what came across,"" he said.
Republicans will take their shot next week in nominating President Donald Trump for a second term.

Seventy-seven people were shot just this weekend in Chicago, 14 of them killed, including a 7-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy.
There was a nightclub shooting in South Carolina. That left two people dead, eight others wounded.
In Alabama, an 8-year-old boy was killed in a shooting at a shopping mall that left three other people hurt there.
And in Atlanta, the mayor saying enough is enough after more than 20 people were shot. Among the victims, an 8-year old girl killed right near the Wendy's where Rayshard Brooks had been shot.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MAYOR KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS (D), ATLANTA: We are doing each other more harm than any police officer on this force. We've had over 75 shootings in the city over the past several weeks.
You can't blame that on APD.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We understand the frustration over Rayshard Brooks. We understand. We ain't got nothing to do with that. We innocent. We didn't mean no harm. My baby didn't mean no harm.
(INAUDIBLE). She never make her (ph) ninth birthday. We ain't do nothing.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
SMITH: In New York City, at least 12 people killed in more than 40 shootings and a dozen stabbings. In response, the president saying this in a tweet, in part, federal government ready, willing, and able to help if asked.
So let's bring in our headliner, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany.
Kayleigh, good morning to you. Thanks so much for being here.
MCENANY: Good morning. Thanks for having me.
SMITH: It is horrific to see what played out in some of these major U.S. cities over the holiday weekend. Deadly shootings, stabbings, children injured, in some cases killed, in this violence.
Does the president see the need to step in at the federal level in these U.S. cities with the violence?
MCENANY: Well, the president sees this as unacceptable. Look, that pain on that mother's face, that was really hard to watch, to think that five children were killed this weekend doing everyday things, like going to the mall and in the car with their mother.
This is happening across America and it's unacceptable. And what the president has done is his DOJ, under his leadership, has been aggressively looking at prosecutions. More than that, we've had federal protective services that have been in these states as a backup to local law enforcement.
Ultimately, it's the responsibility of state governors and mayors who have the police power to patrol their streets, as ascribed in the Constitution. But the president's been doing everything on our part from the federal side and saying that this is unacceptable and it's time for these Democrat mayors and governors to step up because no mother should have to experience the pain that I just saw on that mother's face.
SHAWN: Kayleigh, Eric Shawn here in New York.
We've seen all these demonstrations continuing. You know, basically against the police. Yes, there have been horrible incidents, but where are all the demonstrations for all these victims? This has been going on in Chicago for years. There is carnage on the streets of this country from this uncontrolled violence that's getting even worse. What does the president say about that and the outrage over this -- what's happening?
MCENANY: Yes, that -- that's a great point, where is the outrage for these victims? And, in fact, what you're seeing is, when you have this outspoken attitude against the police, this defund the police movement, one billion taken from the police department in New York, what you see -- and AOC saying that that didn't go far enough and we have to defund the police, you see a pulling back of law enforcement. We've seen those mass retirements in New York that ultimately lead to the kind of violence that we're seeing in the streets.
I mean we saw in L.A., when there was an announcement about funding being pulled from LAPD, we saw an increase in homicides. And it was over a hundred percent increase. So there are real consequences.
We need outrage for these victims and for these horrid incidences of violence that we're seeing that should not be taking place in our streets.
SMITH: Kayleigh, I want to move on to the spike in coronavirus cases that we're seeing in some areas of the country, in particular in recent weeks. The president said this over the weekend and it's getting a lot of headlines.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have tested almost 40 million people. By so doing, we show cases, 99 percent of which are totally harmless, results that no other country can show because no other country is testing that we have, not in terms of the numbers or in terms of the quality.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
SMITH: That's not -- especially not backed up by Stephen Hahn, the FDA director. Dr. Fauci is now warning of new coronavirus mutations that cause the illness to spread even faster.
Does it help to have the president talk about this disease being harmless in 99 percent of instances?
MCENANY: Well, the president was making a factual point that most people will recover from coronavirus who get it, that this very small fraction of people fall victim to coronavirus in a fatal way. And that's because what we're seeing is we have therapeutics, we have ways to treat this.
And when you look at the mortality rates across the world, we are far below Italy. We are far -- we are below Germany. We're below France. And it's because of the great work we've put in. This president takes COVID seriously, but we should note the mortality rate and how well we are doing vis-a-vis the rest of the world.
SMITH: Is he concerned about the spike in cases that we saw especially over the weekend?
MCENANY: The president's monitoring it. He understands that there are fires. He noted that on Friday. But he believes that we, as a federal government, are equipped to handle those fires. We have great therapeutics, dexamethasone and convalescent plasma, and Remdesivir, that are used to treat this. But we're aware of the spikes and we are on it here at the White House.
SHAWN: Kayleigh, do you fear that people perhaps become complacent? You plan a rally -- or the campaign plans a rally in -- Saturday in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. What types of precaution do you think people should take? Should they be wearing masks if they can't social distance?
MCENANY: Yes. So the campaign has been very clear that not only will we be giving out masks, but we recommend the wearing of those masks. It's very important to follow the CDC guidelines.
And one other note that I would put here just to go back to your other question with regard to cases that we're seeing. It's also worth noting what the president consistently emphasizes that at the height of COVID-19 back in April, we were testing about 150,000. Now we're testing more than 650,000 per day. So when we talk about these fires, the president noted, it's also worth noting when you test at the rate at which we do, you do see a greater number of cases.
SMITH: I want to throw this up. This is the latest on the hospitalization stats, since we're talking about numbers. And, in some cases, that is one of the key stats that we look at. The overall accumulative COVID-19 hospitalization rate, 102.5 per 100,000. So, obviously, those key high risk categories are still what we're watching in those cases.
Dr. Fauci and others, who is the -- who does the president listen to the most right now, Kayleigh, as we try to work our way through this disease, considering there's still so much that we don't know and we have so much more to learn about it?
MCENANY: Well, the president hears advice from all kinds of different doctors. Dr. Hahn, Dr. Fauci, Dr. Birx. The task force comes together, packages that information. The president is regularly, daily briefed on this, in fact.
But what the president has seen is, we, as an American society, have stepped up. We had the lowest mortality rate, one of the lowest in the entire world, and that's because of American innovation. That's because under this administration we've led the way on therapeutics. Under this administration, we've put forward $36 billion to find a vaccine and we're hopeful that we'll have that by the end of the year. And it's this president who's teared (sic) down bureaucratic barriers to pave the way for America to work its way through COVID-19.
SHAWN: And, meanwhile, Kayleigh, of course the president gave that speech at Mount Rushmore. We saw that amazing flyover and the celebration on Saturday night from the Air Force, the B-1 bombers, the B-52, actually, up there.
Here's the president speaking about what he says now is a -- basically a culture war.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: This left-wing, cultural revolution is designed to overthrow the American revolution.
We will never let them rip America's heroes from our monuments or from our hearts. By tearing down Washington and Jefferson, these radicals would tear down the very heritage for which men gave their lives to win the Civil War.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
SHAWN: Over the weekend, Kayleigh, a statue of Christopher Columbus was taken down in Baltimore and thrown in the Inner Harbor. The Democratic- controlled New York City Council wants to take Thomas Jefferson out of this city council. And Tammy Duckworth was asked about George Washington -- taking down George Washington, and she replied on CNN that while she -- she would be open to hearing the argument.
What's the view about taking down George Washington and some others?
MCENANY: This is absolute insanity. America is the greatest country on earth. This nation and the bedrock of freedom, put in place by our Constitution and our Declaration of Independence, has done more for the world and for the advancement of human history than any country on planet earth. This is a good country, a country to be proud of and the president will never apologize for what makes America great.
But what the president is saying here, and has said quite clearly in his speech, we're not for the ripping down of monuments, the tearing down of our history. And America stands with him, 71 percent are against the ripping down of statues and monuments and are quite proud of this country and what we've done to advance freedom across the world.
SMITH: You know, Joni Ernst also grabbed a lot of headlines over the weekend, appearing to distance herself from the president, talking about blemishes in our history, talking about the nation needing to come together, but specifically distancing herself from the president when it comes to renaming some of the military bases, peaceful protesters and other things.
What does the president have to say about that this morning?
MCENANY: Well, the president again stands firmly against the renaming of our base. Along with him is 56 percent of this country. This president stands by our monuments, our great monuments, many of which have been defaced, that of abolitionists, like Matthias Baldwin and Ulysses S. Grant and Gandhi, who's the head of -- who is known for peaceful protests and was an inspiration to Reverend Martin Luther King.
These mobs have no ideology. They're defacing abolitionists. They're defacing war monuments to black Americans who served in the Civil War. This is unacceptable and it has no rhyme or reason or no ideological foundation.
SMITH: But considering Joni Ernst's stance, is the president concerned that there might be other Republican members of Congress like her that distance themselves from the president's views on that?
MCENANY: No, because the president knows he stands firmly and squarely with the majority of Americans who think it's unacceptable to pull down our statues, to deface Gandhi, and to deface some of the great abolitionists that we have seen either toppled or torn down across country.
SHAWN: Yes, there even was a -- a destruction of Frederick Douglass -- of a Frederick Douglass statue.
MCENANY: That's right.
SHAWN: Any update -- any update on the garden of statues? I would -- I do want to point out that there is the hall of fame of great Americans in Bronx, New York. It started in 1900. And they have busts, 98 of them. Some of them are some of the same people that the president has proposed for his garden for celebration.
When do we expect that to open? What's going to happen?
MCENANY: Yes, you know, we hope to see that open. And the president has set that date of July 4, 2024, and the 60 days to look into this. And I think the prospect of having a garden of heroes is a great way to make sure that America's students know and understand history by commemorating people like Martin Luther King, Jr. and Betsy Ross, Susan B. Anthony and these great American icons who made great strides for black Americans in this country, and for women in this country.
So, remembering that and knowing our history and celebrating these heroes is the one goal the president has in creating this garden of heroes.
SMITH: Kayleigh, I want to finish off by asking you about a recent tweet of the president's, going back to Bubba Wallace and the investigation of what he and others at the time thought was a noose. There was a federal investigation of that. It was revealed that it was a pull rope for the garage that had been in previous pictures.
The president, though, is bringing it back up in a brand-new tweet. ""Has Bubba Wallace apologized to all those great NASCAR drivers and officials who came to his aid, stood by his side and were willing to sacrifice everything for him, only to find out that the whole thing was just another hoax? That and flag decision has caused lowest ratings ever.""
You -- I -- I -- this was never determined to a hoax, Kayleigh. Is it helpful for the president to bring that back up, considering this is -- this is something, obviously, that the federal investigation weighed in on? He's done many interviews since then. But to determine it a hoax in a new tweet?
MCENANY: So NASCAR, I would note, their statement says that this garage pull rope was there since last fall, since far before the teams arrived at these garages. And they also said definitively, as the FBI investigation determined it, that there was no hate crime, versus Bubba committed (ph). What the president is making is a broader point that this rush to judgment on the facts before the facts are out is not acceptable. And we saw it with the Covington kids and we saw it with Jussie Smollett and now we saw it in this case before the FBI came to that conclusion.
SMITH: But Kayleigh, hold on, that -- people are going to quickly point out that that's a -- that comparison is not fair, to call this a hoax when he stands by that he truly believes that that's what it was.
MCENANY: Right. Well, the Federal Bureau of Investigation does not stand by that assessment. The president's merely pointing out that we've got to let facts come out before we rush to judgments. And there was no hate crime committed against Bubba Wallace, as determined by the FBI, as noted in a NASCAR statement.
SMITH: OK. All right, Kayleigh McEnany, we will leave it there. We've got to go. Appreciate your time this morning. Please, come back soon.
MCENANY: Thank you so much.
SMITH: OK.
SHAWN: Thank you, Kayleigh."

The roll call vote that formally sealed Joe Biden's nomination as the Democratic candidate for president Tuesday came from sites in the 50 states and territories. Biden received votes from the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Alabama and from the parents of murdered hate crime victim Matthew Shepard in Wyoming.
It became a guessing game for viewers: Where will my state's delegates speak from? Washington Post editor Tanya Sichynsky tweeted that it was “the most any of us have traveled in months.”
“It's like the Olympic parade of nations,” tweeted NBC's Kasie Hunt, “which I so missed this year.”
It made the ABC and CBS decisions to cut away from the roll call to show portions of former President Bill Clinton's address feel like old hat. None of Tuesday's speakers had the immediate impact of former First Lady Michelle Obama on Monday night.
The nomination was marked by a Zoom-like outbreak of applause and streamers tossed at Biden and his wife, Jill, as Kool & The Gang's “Celebration” played in the background.
“Not quite the same,” said ABC's George Stephanopoulos.
Democrats have worked to produce a relentlessly theme-driven facsimile, but it still isn't a television event like past conventions. Television viewership for Monday's first night was sharply down compared with the opening of Hillary Clinton's nomination week in 2016.
An estimated 19.7 million people watched Monday's coverage between 10 and 11 p.m. on some 10 different television networks, the Nielsen company said. Four years ago, opening night drew just under 26 million viewers.
The Biden campaign claimed their event was a hit online, with campaign spokesman T.J. Ducklo saying an additional 10 million people streamed live video of the convention on various platforms. Those numbers could not immediately be independently verified.
Broadcast networks were hit hardest by the changed format. NBC's telecast drew 2.28 million viewers, down from 4.29 million four years ago, Nielsen said. ABC reached 2.44 million people on Monday, compared to 4.13 million.
The left-leaning MSNBC, where Rachel Maddow, Joy Reid and Nicolle Wallace were anchors, led the way Monday with 5.1 million viewers, up from four years ago. CNN had 4.78 million. Unlike the broadcasters, the two cable networks ran the Democrats' production nearly in its entirety.
Fox News Channel's audience was unimpressed; the 2.1 million viewers it reached for its hour of convention coverage compared poorly with the 3.4 million viewers that time slot occupant Laura Ingraham had on an average July day. Earlier in the evening, Fox kept to its regular lineup with Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity criticizing the Biden campaign, instead of showing news coverage of the convention.
Veteran television producer Don Mischer, whose credits include the Oscars, the Emmys and the 2004 Democratic national convention, said that while the convention's first night was well-produced, it suffered from the lack of a live audience.
While Obama “hit a home run” with her speech, “had that been done in front of the crowd, with the crowd's emotion getting stronger and stronger as she went through that speech, by the time she got to the end, there would have been a rush of palpable emotion that would have resonated with people many times greater than what came across,” he said.
Republicans will take their shot next week in nominating President Donald Trump for a second term.

He was just 3 years old when the terrorist group al-Qaida launched a series of four coordinated attacks against the United States using four hijacked passenger airplanes. Two of the planes crashed into the Twin Towers of New York City's World Trade Center, while a third was flown into the Pentagon, the Department of Defense headquarters, near Washington. Passengers on the fourth plane, likely bound for the White House, retook control of the aircraft and crashed it into a field in Pennsylvania.
Thayer's mother picked him up from preschool in the middle of the day, frantic.
She drove to the family home in Springfield, Virginia, a 15-minute drive from the Pentagon. She set Thayer in front of the TV while she desperately attempted to call his father, Bradley Thayer, who was working at the Pentagon that day but evacuated successfully.
'There was this one shaky cam, grainy footage, of the second plane hitting the second tower … constantly on the news,' said the younger Thayer, now 22. 'I just remembered that clip looping over and over again, of just seeing the second plane, not very far away, hitting the tower.'
That day, 2,977 people died, as did all 19 of the al-Qaida hijackers, in the single deadliest terrorist attack on U.S. soil.
Nineteen years later, Thayer is a fifth-year undergraduate student at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, where he triple-majors in physics, mathematics and German. Thayer, despite his near-photographic memory, can only recall some scenes from the day of the attacks.
For older Americans, in contrast, 9/11 remains a vivid memory. Ten years later, 97% of Americans 8 or older at the time could remember exactly where they were when they heard the news, according to a 2011 survey by the Pew Research Center.
For many young people, though, 9/11 is a subject learned secondhand.
'It feels like something that we learned in history books, something like World War Two,' said Christina Liu, 22, from New York City. Liu graduated from New York University last year and will start work this month as an associated development operations engineer at Veeva Systems, a cloud computing company in California.
'It seems very distant to me, despite being an event that happened in my lifetime,' added Liu, who found she couldn't distinguish her memories of 9/11 from her memories of a massive 2003 power outage dubbed the Great Northeast Blackout.
That's to be expected, according to research on collective memory, the pools of memory that can define social groups like generations.
In a 2016 study, Howard Schuman and Amy Corning, researchers with the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor's Institute for Social Research, compared years of survey data on the Vietnam War and 9/11 to predict how generations of Americans might remember the attacks.
Their study supported the 'critical years' hypothesis, which suggests that events happening when people are between 10 and 30 years old have the greatest likelihood of defining generations. People older than 30 may consider other, earlier events in their lives as more important to them, while those younger than 10 may be too young to fully understand the significance of an event.
'Earlier events learned about indirectly from school or media … cannot have the same emotional impact regardless of their objective significance,' wrote Schuman and Corning in the study, published in the International Journal of Public Opinion Research.
Some experts think the attacks are what sets the Millennial generation, whose members were born between the early 1980s and mid-1990s, apart from the next one, Generation Z, born beginning in the mid-1990s.
'It is 9/11 that is the defining and dividing event,"" Jack Dorsey, president of the Center for Generational Kinetics, told Business Insider in 2019. ""Either you remember it and all the emotion that goes with it or you don't, and if you don't, then you're in Gen Z.'
Many younger Americans have grown up in a post-9/11 world, where developments like stricter airport security measures, Islamophobia or the U.S. war on terror have always been a reality.
'I wasn't really cognizant of the devastation caused that day,' said Camryn Permann, 21, from Los Angeles, home to an estimated 70,000 American Muslims, according to a 2010 survey of religious institutions conducted by the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies.
She recalled traveling with Muslim friends and watching them be selected consistently for randomized security checks at airports.
'For me, the only part that I saw was the aftermath of widespread, nationwide Islamophobia that I've seen carried out my entire life. That's been a part of my world since then,' said Permann, who graduated from California State University, Northridge last year, and has been working as a sign language interpreter at Purple Communications since.
Anti-Islamic hate crimes in the U.S. surged in the weeks after 9/11, according to a 2007 study in the Journal of Ethnicity in Criminal Justice. The Islamic Center of Southern California in Los Angeles required police protection after receiving threats in the wake of 9/11, according to photo captions in LAist.
Sadia Fahimul, 22, a friend of Permann's, remembered her parents warning her that for her own safety, she didn't need to tell people she was Muslim.
'One time I brought it [being Muslim] up in class … in middle school, and someone asked me, 'Were you sad when Osama bin Laden got killed?'' said Fahimul, who graduated last year from Bentley University in Massachusetts with a degree in marketing. 'I think they genuinely thought that he was part of our religion, when he's not, he's an extremist. I don't even know how I answered, but I remember I was shocked that they even asked me something like that.'
Young people appeared divided on 9/11 and its complicated aftermath.
'It's just interesting to me [that] what Americans choose to remember and emphasize is an attack against Americans by people from outside of the country, but [they] aren't as concerned about attacks on people within this country, by people from this country,' Permann said.
Permann pointed at the racism and discrimination she and other Black and LGBTQ Americans face, alongside other minority populations. She also noted the death toll from the ongoing pandemic, which has killed nearly 200,000 Americans, according to Johns Hopkins University.
The surge in Islamophobia, combined with nearly 20 years of American-led conflicts abroad, is why Thayer said he thought it was 'incredibly important' for the memory of 9/11 to be passed down to successive generations.
'It's not to memorialize it,' he said. 'To me, you remember it [9/11] because it gives context to everything else that happened.'
After 9/11, the U.S. launched an international military campaign, known as the war on terror, targeting extremist Islamic groups throughout the Middle East, Africa and Asia.
By the end of this fiscal year on September 30, the U.S. will have spent over $6.4 trillion on its post-9/11 military involvement abroad, according to a joint 2019 study from Brown University and Boston University. The study is part of a larger project. Other studies in the collaboration estimated that the conflicts have killed over 800,000 people and displaced 37 million more.
' I feel like we also need to learn more about the aftermath of it (9/11),' said Fahimul.
'We forget about the … children and families that were killed as a result of the war that came after, all the people that are displaced and, also, people in the United States that were affected by the racism and the hate.'
For Taylor Bair, 21, from North Carolina, this extended death toll is part of the significance of 9/11. One of her friends lost her mother that day. Bair's grandmother, a flight attendant, was hours from boarding a flight to Washington when the first plane struck the North Tower of the World Trade Center complex.
'How [emotionally] close you were to this event impacts how you see it,' said Blair, a senior at Appalachian State University in North Carolina studying psychology and special education.
'But even though it's easy to look at something you weren't connected to and ask why does it matter now, it seriously impacted the lives of thousands of people,' she added. 'The people that did die in [9/11], they're not necessarily people who were well-known, but they had lives and they had family.'
For now, the commemorations continue, despite the pandemic. The 9/11 Memorial and Museum in New York City will reopen September 11 for families of those affected, and for the general public on the next day. Earlier in the week, officials near the site of the crash in Pennsylvania broke ground on a new part of a trail that connects the country's three main 9/11 memorials."

Earlier events learned about indirectly from school or media ... cannot have the same emotional impact regardless of their objective significance, wrote Schuman and Corning in the study, published in the International Journal of Public Opinion Research.
Some experts think the attacks are what sets the Millennial generation, whose members were born between the early 1980s and mid-1990s, apart from the next one, Generation Z, born beginning in the mid-1990s.
It is 9/11 that is the defining and dividing event,"" Jack Dorsey, president of the Center for Generational Kinetics, told Business Insider in 2019. ""Either you remember it and all the emotion that goes with it or you don't, and if you don't, then you're in Gen Z.
Many younger Americans have grown up in a post-9/11 world, where developments like stricter airport security measures, Islamophobia or the U.S. war on terror have always been a reality.
I wasn't really cognizant of the devastation caused that day, said Camryn Permann, 21, from Los Angeles, home to an estimated 70,000 American Muslims, according to a 2010 survey of religious institutions conducted by the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies.
She recalled traveling with Muslim friends and watching them be selected consistently for randomized security checks at airports.
For me, the only part that I saw was the aftermath of widespread, nationwide Islamophobia that I've seen carried out my entire life. That's been a part of my world since then, said Permann, who graduated from California State University, Northridge last year, and has been working as a sign language interpreter at Purple Communications since.
Anti-Islamic hate crimes in the U.S. surged in the weeks after 9/11, according to a 2007 study in the Journal of Ethnicity in Criminal Justice. The Islamic Center of Southern California in Los Angeles required police protection after receiving threats in the wake of 9/11, according to photo captions in LAist.
Sadia Fahimul, 22, a friend of Permann's, remembered her parents warning her that for her own safety, she didn't need to tell people she was Muslim.
One time I brought it [being Muslim] up in class ... in middle school, and someone asked me, 'Were you sad when Osama bin Laden got killed?' said Fahimul, who graduated last year from Bentley University in Massachusetts with a degree in marketing. I think they genuinely thought that he was part of our religion, when he's not, he's an extremist. I don't even know how I answered, but I remember I was shocked that they even asked me something like that.
Young people appeared divided on 9/11 and its complicated aftermath.
It's just interesting to me [that] what Americans choose to remember and emphasize is an attack against Americans by people from outside of the country, but [they] aren't as concerned about attacks on people within this country, by people from this country, Permann said.
Permann pointed at the racism and discrimination she and other Black and LGBTQ Americans face, alongside other minority populations. She also noted the death toll from the ongoing pandemic, which has killed nearly 200,000 Americans, according to Johns Hopkins University.
The surge in Islamophobia, combined with nearly 20 years of American-led conflicts abroad, is why Thayer said he thought it was incredibly important for the memory of 9/11 to be passed down to successive generations.
It's not to memorialize it, he said. To me, you remember it [9/11] because it gives context to everything else that happened.
After 9/11, the U.S. launched an international military campaign, known as the war on terror, targeting extremist Islamic groups throughout the Middle East, Africa and Asia.
By the end of this fiscal year on September 30, the U.S. will have spent over $6.4 trillion on its post-9/11 military involvement abroad, according to a joint 2019 study from Brown University and Boston University. The study is part of a larger project. Other studies in the collaboration estimated that the conflicts have killed over 800,000 people and displaced 37 million more.
I feel like we also need to learn more about the aftermath of it (9/11), said Fahimul.
We forget about the ... children and families that were killed as a result of the war that came after, all the people that are displaced and, also, people in the United States that were affected by the racism and the hate.
For Taylor Bair, 21, from North Carolina, this extended death toll is part of the significance of 9/11. One of her friends lost her mother that day. Bair's grandmother, a flight attendant, was hours from boarding a flight to Washington when the first plane struck the North Tower of the World Trade Center complex.
How [emotionally] close you were to this event impacts how you see it, said Blair, a senior at Appalachian State University in North Carolina studying psychology and special education.
But even though it's easy to look at something you weren't connected to and ask why does it matter now, it seriously impacted the lives of thousands of people, she added. The people that did die in [9/11], they're not necessarily people who were well-known, but they had lives and they had family.
For now, the commemorations continue, despite the pandemic. The 9/11 Memorial and Museum in New York City will reopen September 11 for families of those affected, and for the general public on the next day. Earlier in the week, officials near the site of the crash in Pennsylvania broke ground on a new part of a trail that connects the country's three main 9/11 memorials. - VOA"

Richard Dial, a special agent with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, said co-defendant William ""Roddie"" Bryan, who filmed part of the incident, told authorities he heard Travis McMichael say ""f--ing n--r"" moments after the Feb. 23 shooting.
It was one of several stunning details shared during a probable cause hearing Thursday at the Glynn County courthouse. McMichael and his ex-cop father, 64-year-old Gregory, joined the hearing via a video link from the county's jail, where they're being held on felony murder and aggravated assault charges.
Originally no charges were filed in the shooting near Brunswick, Ga., but the release of the video on May 5 sparked outrage and led to the GBI taking up the case.
Bryan, who's accused of ambushing and blocking Arbery to allow McMichaels to kill him, did not appear in court but was represented by his attorney.
The case has fueled widespread anger and allegations of racial profiling, with critics describing the killing as a modern-day lynching.
The hearing - which lasted more than six hours and sometimes felt like a ""mini-trial,"" as special prosecutor Jesse Evans put it - offered a glimpse into the possible defense strategies as the case moves to trial.
Defense attorneys portrayed their clients as three concerned ""patriots"" trying to carry out a citizen's arrest following a string of burglaries in the neighborhood. Bryan's attorney, meanwhile, repeatedly tried to downplay his client's involvement or potential racial bias against Arbery.
But prosecutors convinced the judge to keep the three men in jail and leave the charges intact. Evans told the court the evidence will show Arbery ""was chased, hunted down and ultimately executed"" while jogging just 2 miles from his Brunswick home in broad daylight.
Dial testified that Bryan and the McMichaels chased the 25-year-old victim for about seven minutes, with Bryan hitting Arbery with his truck during the pursuit. Arbery managed to escape and change direction multiple times before he was eventually shot.
The defendants, who avoided charges for over two months, told police in February they had ""a gut feeling"" the young man was behind a series of break-ins in the neighborhood. The pair claimed Arbery attacked them during the confrontation, according to Dial's testimony.
During cross-examination, Dial said Travis McMichael told police he raised the weapon about 90 feet away from Arbery and warned him to stop and get on the ground. But the victim then ran around the right side of the McMichaels' truck before the pair got into a scuffle, the video shows.
Dial said Arbery's actions suggest he was the one acting in self-defense.
""I don't believe it was self-defense for Mr. McMichael. I believe it was self-defense for Mr. Arbery,"" the investigator told the court. ""I think Mr. Arbery was trying to get away. He couldn't, so he chose to fight.""
Arbery was shot twice in the chest and once in his right wrist, authorities said.
Dial also revealed Thursday that after the McMichaels were arrested in early May, Gregory McMichael described 50-year-old Bryan, who's also white, as an ""ally"" during a jailhouse phone call.
The GBI agent also claims to have evidence of Travis McMichael, 34, using racial slurs multiple times in the past. The former Coast Guard boarding officer once told a friend he loves his job because he was ""out on a boat and there weren't any n---s"" around, according to Dial's investigation.
In addition, the agent said that McMichael family members took photos of the crime scene and shared them on social media.
The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating the shooting as a possible hate crime.
Arbery's mother watched some of the hearing Thursday but walked out of the courtroom after the defense team began questioning her son's actions and even his mental health prior to the shooting. Attorney S. Lee Merritt, who is representing the Arbery family, said Wanda Cooper-Jones was ""exhausted by the character assassination of her son.""
""Mr. Arbery's mental health, his kindergarten records, his high school basketball records, his football stats had nothing to do with this trial and was inappropriate in this case,"" Merritt told reporters outside the courthouse.
A witness in the case has previously said the McMichaels had a confrontation with Arbery about two weeks before the shooting after seeing the victim coming out of a home under construction. Arbery was caught on surveillance video visiting that property multiple times, including moments before the fatal encounter, but authorities and the homeowner say there's no evidence the victim ever stole anything from the site.
A local police commissioner has also said that the last burglary in the area was reported more than seven weeks earlier, on New Year's Day."

Here's what's in the bill.",FALSE,"Jun 09, 2020( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex) Democrats in Congress unveiled police reform legislation on Monday following widespread protests over police brutality.The most recent round of protests was sparked by the May 25 death of George Floyd, a black man who died after being knelt on by a white police officer.The bill would ban chokeholds, create a misconduct registry, and mandate training against racial profiling, among other changes.Here's a summary of what's included in the bill.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[1]. Democrats in Congress unveiled police reform legislation on Monday following widespread protests over police brutality.The bill, known as the Justice in Policing Act of 2020, would ban chokeholds, create a misconduct registry, and mandate training against racial profiling, among other changes to national policy.The bill was sponsored by Rep. Karen Bass of California, who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, and Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, in the House. Sens. 
Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California sponsored the bill in the Senate. The bill targets four different issues: police accountability, transparency, training, and justice for victims of lynching According to a summary of the bill[2], the legislation breaks down its approach to police reform through several sections: Police accountability, police transparency through data, improving police training and policies, and justice for victims of lynching.Among the reforms outlined under police accountability, the bill would grant power to the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division to issue subpoenas to police departments in order to conduct ""pattern and practice"" investigations ""into discriminatory and unconstitutional policing practices.""Additionally, it would provide grants to state attorneys general to ""create an independent process to investigate misconduct or excessive use of force"" by police.Reforms outlined under police transparency, include establishing a federal register of police misconduct complaints and whether or not disciplinary action was taken. The bill would also require states to report incidences where of use of force and include the sex, race, ethnicity, and housing status of civilians targeted.The bill calls to improve police training and policies, including prohibiting federal, state, and local law enforcement from racial, religious, and discriminatory profiling, and mandate that law enforcement provide training on profiling and racial bias.Notably, the bill would ban no-knock warrants for officers investigating drug cases, an issue cast to the forefront of the national agenda after police shot Breonna Taylor at least eight times while raiding her apartment on March 13[3]. The bill would also prohibit the use of a chokehold and would require uniformed officers to wear body cameras and marked police vehicles to be equipped with dashboard cameras.Lastly, the bill calls for justice for victims of lynching, and would make it a federal crime to ""conspire to violate existing hate crime laws."" The bill has widespread support from Democrats, though Republicans remain skeptical At a press conference unveiling the bill[4], Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said that the bill was a ""first step"" in targeting systemic racism in the US.""Police brutality is a heartbreaking reflection of an entrenched system of racial injustice in America,"" Pelosi said. ""True justice can only be achieved with full, comprehensive action. That is what we are doing today. This is a first step. There is more to come.""Pelosi and other members of Congress also knelt in silence for eight minutes and 46 seconds to honor George Floyd, who died after being knelt on for that period of time by white police officer Derek Chauvin.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to commit to putting the police reform bill on the Senate floor for voting before July 4.A spokesperson for former vice president and 2020 Democrat Joe Biden said[5] he ""fully supports"" numerous provisions outlined in the bill.""Systemic racism and inequality have plagued our country for generations, and the time for talk is over. Americans want action,"" the statement said.The bill, however, does not go as far as some rights groups, including Black Lives Matter and the ACLU[6], have in calling for funds to be diverted away from police toward social welfare programs. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez[7] of New York and other progressive leaders[8] have voiced support for the defund the police movement.And Republicans remain skeptical of the Democrats' proposal.Manu Raju, CNN's senior congressional correspondent, said[9] Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham was ""open-minded"" about ideas mentioned in the Democratic bill, including creating a registry of police misconduct and banning chokeholds.Sen. Mitt Romney announced plans[10] to introduce a bipartisan police reform bill and called the Democratic-led proposal a ""message piece as opposed to a real piece of legislation.""President Donald Trump and other top Republicans[11] have accused Democrats of attempting to push radical reform[12] and promote the disbanding of local police departments, which has gained support by some protesters[13] in recent weeks but is not being considered in the current Democratic proposal.

202,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_751/Files (250).DOCX","IANS-English",2020-06-28,"1014 words",NA,NA,NA,"In communal appeal to Muslim voters, Biden raises Kashmir in religious context",FALSE," New York, June 28 (IANS) In an openly communal appeal to Muslim voters, Joe Biden, the Democratic Party candidate for President, has dragged Kashmir into his campaign in a religious context rather than as a foreign policy or a general human rights issue. 
 His ""Agenda for Muslim American Communities"" published by his campaign also criticises the Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens.
 Biden is assured of being formally nominated by the Democrats as its candidate at the party's national convention in August to challenge President Donald Trump in the November election as he has won the required delegates in the primary elections.
 Unlike in India, parties are allowed to openly appeal to voters on the basis of religion.
 Turning what are foreign policy or general human rights matters into a religious issue, Biden's Muslim agenda says: ""In Kashmir, the Indian government should take all necessary steps to restore rights for all the people of Kashmir. Restrictions on dissent, such as preventing peaceful protests or shutting or slowing down the Internet, weaken democracy.""
 Turning to other contentious issues, the agenda, which is the basis for outreach to Muslim voters, says: ""Joe Biden has been disappointed by the measures that the government of India has taken with the implementation and aftermath of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam and the passage of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) into law.
 ""These measures are inconsistent with the country's long tradition of secularism and with sustaining a multi-ethnic and multi-religious democracy.""
 While criticising the CAA, Biden's Muslim agenda, however, is silent on a US legislation similar to the CAA. Tucked into the US budget bill, the Specter Amendment excludes Muslim refugees from Iran from getting preferential asylum as religious refugees.
 The Biden campaign has not issued so far an agenda for Hindu-Americans or Sikh-Americans or Buddhist-Americans.
 But separately, Biden has taken up the issue of persecution of Hindus and Sikhs in Afghanistan.
 After a terror attack on a gurdwara in Kabul killed at least 25 Sikhs in March, Biden issued a statement expressing concern over the ""intense persecutiona of the members of the two religions in Afghanistan and urged the State Department to consider refugee protection for them.
 Trump officials have declined make a commitment to allowing Sikhs and Hindus in Afghanistan coming to the US as refugees to avoid persecution.
 Biden's Agenda for Asian American and Pacific Islander Communities, which is not religiously-oriented, mentioned Hindus and Sikhs, along with Muslims, as victims of ""discrimination and hate"" in the US and said the situation was made worse by ""Trump's dangerous rhetoric"".
 The Muslim agenda noted that the administration of former President Barack Obama in which he was the Vice President began to separately monitor hate crimes against Hindus and Sikhs.
 It said that the Obama-Biden administration ""added 'Anti-Sikh' and 'Anti-Hindu' to the Department of Justice's hate crime reporting categories"".
 It said ""his (Biden's) Justice Department will prioritise prosecuting hate crimes"".
 But the Obama-Biden administration had failed to act on anti-Hindu hate crimes like the placing of a severed cow's head at a Hindu cow sanctuary in 2016 in Pennsylvania.
 Biden's focus on Kashmir, the CAA and the NRC is driven by the ascendancy of the left in the Democratic Party, which is led by House of Representatives members like Pramila Jayapal, Ilhan Omar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortes.
 Ocasio-Cortes has tried to link US arms sales to India with communal violence. She tweeted: ""President Trump is engaging in arms deals with Modi while his administration is ethnically cleansing the country's religious minorities. We must not enable this rise in sectarian violence.""
 Jayapal and Omar have been at the forefront of the criticism of India in Congress.
 A Hindu member of the campaign has been attacked personally and Biden has been asked to remove him because he is considered sympathetic to Modi and his father, according to some media reports, was linked to the Overseas Friends of the BJP.
 But Amit Jani, the Asian American Pacific Islander outreach director for the Biden campaign continues so far on the job.
 An organisation called Equity Labs published an open letter that said: ""To hire a supporter and friend of Narendra Modi opens the door to embracing anti-Muslim and Hindu nationalist politics.
 ""Progressive Asian Americans and South Asian Americans cannot stand by a candidate with relationships to fascists, here or abroad.""
 A Change.org online petition calling for Jani's removal received 6,668 signatures as of Saturday night.
 Such pressures would make it difficult for Biden, if he is elected, to work with India in the global context, even when the interests of the two countries intersect.
 How the pressures from the left would translate into Biden policy is an open question and will have to await a better and comprehensive articulation of his foreign policy.
 According to the Pew Research Center, Muslims make up 0.9 per cent of the US population and Hindus 0.7 per cent.
 Although their numbers are not that far apart, Muslims exert more open influence in the Democratic Party for two reasons: African-Americans, a group that is important in the party and vocal make up an important segment of American Muslims, and the party's left wing that is very articulate and increasing in importance is both pro-Muslim and critical of India.
 The Democratic Party has not made overt overtures to Hindus as it has to other religious groups.
 On the other hand, Trump attended a Hindu Republican rally during his 2016 campaign.
 One of the sessions of the Republican National Convention that nominated him opened with a Sikh prayer.
 The State Department has expressed concerns about the detentions and other restrictions in Kashmir, but in a non-religious context while also acknowledging India's democracy.

203,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_751/Files (250).DOCX","The New York Times",2020-07-19,"3910 words","Section SR; Column 0; Sunday Review Desk; Pg. 6","By Seyward Darby",NA,"One Woman's Descent Into Hate",FALSE,"The Sunday Review editor Honor Jones wrote about our decision to publish this story about the white supremacy movement in Friday's edition of our Opinion Today newsletter.
SEATTLE -- Mount Rainier bobbed in the rearview mirror as Corinna Olsen drove north. In the passenger seat, I felt a soft bump against my back whenever she pumped the brakes. It came from a human head. Behind me, wrapped in opaque plastic, was a dead body. 
 Ms. Olsen is an embalmer, and her Dodge minivan is retrofitted for her job -- instead of seats, the back holds two gurneys. She had picked up this particular body from a county coroner's office for transport to a funeral home. I was along for the ride because I was writing a book about hate in America, and Ms. Olsen used to be a white nationalist.
 ''I've been trying to decide which is the lesser of two evils, blacks or Mexicans,'' she wrote in a post on Stormfront, the hate movement's oldest online forum, in 2008. She went on to describe racist stereotypes, tarring Black people as criminals and saying Mexicans have too many kids.
 Her language was cruel but familiar, drawing from America's communal well of white supremacy. Many white Americans are quick to distinguish between everyday prejudice and radical bigotry, but it's a false distinction. White nationalists make explicit ideas that are already coded or veiled in the wider white imagination. Hate is what many people would see if they looked in a fun-house mirror: a distorted but still recognizable reflection.
 It is important to acknowledge this ugly truth if we hope to understand events now unfolding across the country.
 Thousands of white people are joining protests against police brutality. Polls show a surge of support for the Black Lives Matter movement, and three-quarters of Americans believe racial discrimination is a serious problem, a 25-point jump from five years ago. These developments are heartening in a country that has refused a meaningful reckoning with racism for the last 400 years.
 It would be a mistake, however, to assume that this moment heralds a future of unprecedented harmony.
 There are questions about whether white lip service will translate into sustained anti-racist action, and about what the same people who condemn unlawful killings of Black Americans might have to say about less violent manifestations of racism, ones that benefit them. There is also the inevitability of backlash: History shows that there are always people who turn to hate in the very moments that others find hope.
 There are nearly 1,000 hate groups in America, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, and the distribution of white-supremacist propaganda is ever widening. We know little about how to combat hate effectively; the federal government has cut funding for programs to counter right-wing extremism and blocked the dissemination of data on the subject. Only last year did the Department of Homeland Security acknowledge that white supremacy is a national security threat.
 The gaps in knowledge mean that journalists and politicians often rely on flawed assumptions -- for instance, that white nationalism is the sole province of angry men. Men are the far right's most recognizable evangelists, and bombings, shootings and rallies are the most obvious manifestations of the movement's strength. But there is other work keeping the flames of hate alive, and it is often done by women. Women like Corinna Olsen.
 Ms. Olsen became an embalmer in her late 20s because, in a way, she had to. Divorced with two kids, she needed to make money. She had never finished college and did not have any demonstrable professional skills. But she had always been fascinated by rituals and what she calls ''the misunderstood''-- subjects that are taboo or macabre. Embalming fit the bill.
 Ms. Olsen also had a personal connection to the profession because of her younger brother, Harley. He was fun, outgoing, well-liked -- everything she was not. Ms. Olsen had always struggled to connect with other people and to be understood.
 At 20, Harley drowned in a boating accident on Oregon's Crescent Lake. Ms. Olsen was never able to look at his body. It took the authorities more than a year to recover it, and then he was cremated. As an embalmer, Ms. Olsen decided to specialize in difficult cases -- gunshot victims, bodies charred in fires, corpses with battered and broken faces -- to give families one last chance to see, maybe even to recognize, their loved ones.
 Harley also inadvertently introduced Ms. Olsen to white nationalism. On what would have been his 27th birthday, in 2008, she found herself wanting to know more about her brother and the things that had mattered to him. He had been an anarchist who listened to punk music, wore black combat boots and hung out with skinheads in studded leather jackets. So Ms. Olsen went online and typed in, ''What are skinheads?''
 She told me that she had no idea at the time that some skinheads were neo-Nazis. That's hard to believe, but similar explanations came up often in our conversations about her time in the hate movement. When she said that she hadn't known any better, I didn't get the impression that she hoped I would feel sorry for her. (I didn't.) Rather, she seemed to be saying that she knew she'd been an idiot. She should have known better and could have, if she'd cared to think more critically.
 Ms. Olsen had never thought too hard about being white. Like many white Americans, she never had to. She grew up in a largely white school district in Eugene, Ore., and she did not interact meaningfully with people of other races until her late 20s, when she moved to Portland for her embalming career. She had paid such little mind to race as a concept that there was a flatness to her understanding of it, a one-dimensionality susceptible to simplified reasoning.
 When her search for information about skinheads led straight to Stormfront, the racist bowels of the internet, Ms. Olsen wasn't fazed. Some Stormfront users said vile and violent things, but others talked about white pride and heritage.
 And that didn't seem bad to her. Black people could celebrate their roots, Hispanic people, too. It stood to reason, Ms. Olsen thought, that white people should be able to do the same. Stormfront users presented this as if it were a mathematical proof, not a notion freighted with a racist, violent history.
 Ms. Olsen wrote a post introducing herself and asking, ''Is there something wrong with being a white supremacist? I don't outwardly profess hatred for other races; I have to work with them and also serve clients of other races in my industry, and I am very good at what I do. I don't advocate violence toward other races.'' She continued, ''What is wrong with seeing our race as superior to that of the blacks? Don't we all?''
 The responses were plentiful and affirming. ''There is nothing wrong with having a personal opinion,'' one read. A commenter with the handle Thoughtful Patriot wrote, ''Let's face reality: People self-segregate by race.'' Race, the person added, ''is an intrinsic part of who we are.''
 To Ms. Olsen, these people seemed smart. Just as important, she told me, ''they seemed immensely interested in me and my life, and they wanted to be my friend.'' To someone who ''grew up without friends, that was very appealing. It made me feel like I must be doing something right.''
 She wasn't always sure that she believed what she said when she echoed her new friends' views, but what mattered was that they wanted to keep talking to her; all she had to do was log in and start typing. If playing a part graduated to instinct, maybe they would like her even more.
 The most basic definition of hate is personal animus, but there is a more useful, and frightening, description: Hate is a social bond -- a shared currency -- and it abhors a vacuum.
 Kathleen Blee, a sociologist and expert in ''racist activism,'' writes that ''social camaraderie, a desire for simple answers to complex political problems, or even the opportunity to take action against formidable social forces can coexist with, even substitute for, hatred as the reason for participation in organized racist activities.''
 So can a need for validation, visibility and purpose. For someone like Ms. Olsen, hate becomes a cure for loneliness.
 People who are drawn to the hate movement have an acute desire to make sense of their place in the world. There's a gap between who they are and who they think they should be, what they have and what they want. They want to seize or regain what they believe is a rightful status. They want empowerment, with minimal effort. Hate promises them that.
 The movement's appeal goes something like this: America is a white country, built by white people, that is under attack from the enemies of the white race. The time is now or never to forestall racial annihilation. Anyone can do that by embracing white pride, standing up for the well-being of white people and securing America's future by having white children. Whoever joins the movement will be part of something greater than themselves, a ''righteous'' cause.
 ''Who doesn't want to lead people to victory?'' Ms. Olsen asked me.
 Hate always exists, but it surges during periods of social upheaval, offering racist explanations for seismic change.
 The Ku Klux Klan formed after the Civil War and reached its zenith in the 1920s, in an expanding, diversifying country. ''Its allures were manifold,'' the historian Linda Gordon writes of the Klan. ''They included the rewards of being an insider, of belonging to a community, of expressing and acting on resentments, of participating in drama, of feeling religiously and morally righteous, of turning a profit.''
 White Citizens' Councils and other organs of resistance emerged in reaction to the civil rights movement. Hate fed on opposition to second- and third-wave feminism, the expansion of L.G.B.T.Q. rights, and shifting racial demographics.
 Then came the election of President Barack Obama. ''Right-wing extremists are harnessing this historical election as a recruitment tool,'' a Homeland Security report noted in 2009. The first year of Mr. Obama's presidency, Stormfront registered nearly 100,000 new users.
 Ms. Olsen was part of this wave, which also found fuel in the xenophobia of the post-Sept. 11 era and public disgust with the financial crisis. Her involvement accelerated quickly. Some of her online friends asked to meet in real life, and by 2009, she was the head of Portland's chapter of the National Socialist Movement. She read ''Mein Kampf,'' donned a uniform with Nazi insignia for meetings, and placed recruitment fliers with phrases like ''Jewish people are ruining America'' on windshields in parking lots.
 In November 2009, she traveled with fellow neo-Nazis to Phoenix to attend a rally demanding a halt to the immigration of anyone who was not white. Participants also wanted to expel nonwhite people already in America. The rally's theme was ''America First,'' a slogan once used by isolationist politicians and the Klan that, several years later, Mr. Trump would invoke in his campaign for the White House.
 Ms. Olsen's embalming career faltered and she all but lost contact with her children as she went deeper into the movement. In 2010, she left Portland for Montana, where she moved in with a white nationalist named April Gaede, best known as the stage mom of Prussian Blue, blond twin girls who made national headlines for playing racist music. The duo's name was a reference to the color of the residue left -- or not left, according to Holocaust deniers -- by Zyklon B in Nazi gas chambers.
 After a few months, Ms. Olsen had a falling out with Ms. Gaede and relocated to Seattle, where she started working for the Northwest Front, a group that promoted the establishment of a white homeland in the Pacific Northwest. She soon gained notoriety as the co-host of Radio Free Northwest, a weekly broadcast, under the name ''Axis Sally.'' It was a reference to Mildred Gillars, an American woman living in Germany who was handpicked by Joseph Goebbels to spread propaganda on Nazi radio to Allied troops in Europe. Gillars was later convicted of treason.
 Being Axis Sally gave Gillars, a struggling actress, a platform, popularity and power. It did the same for Ms. Olsen. She became briefly famous enough for a Gawker profile in 2010: ''The internet is full of strange people,'' it read. Ms. Olsen ''may be the strangest.''
 Many people rationalize their racism -- or even refuse to call it that -- by insisting that it isn't as bad as someone else's. They could spit on immigrants instead of complaining in private about foreigners stealing American jobs. They could put Jewish people in camps instead of muttering about how they have too much power.
 Bigotry has many branches, some bigger and stronger than others, but they all derive from the same trunk. No wonder, then, that when ''somebody said he didn't like Black people, or he told a racist joke, or he said illegal immigration is wrong,'' Ms. Olsen recalled, she assumed he might be interested in becoming a neo-Nazi, too.
 There were, however, lines Ms. Olsen said she wouldn't cross. In 2011, she decided she was done with white nationalism. That January, the police in Spokane disarmed a pipe bomb left on a bench along the route of a parade for Martin Luther King's Birthday. The bomb contained 128 fishing weights coated with rat poison, which impedes blood clotting, and human feces, which teem with infection-causing bacteria. The engineer was Kevin Harpham, an Army veteran and neo-Nazi who frequented the same kinds of online forums Ms. Olsen did.
 Mr. Harpham would plead guilty to attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and to a hate crime. He said in court that he had intended for the bomb to be a protest against multiculturalism. It was also a gesture to fellow white nationalists. When people plant bombs, burn crosses, or run their cars into crowds of peaceful protesters, they are reinforcing their place in a community by inflicting terror.
 In her telling, Ms. Olsen decided to leave the hate movement because she realized that she could not tolerate violence. That may have been part of it, but when I spoke to her, it was clear that she also exited because the movement stopped giving her the meaning and camaraderie she wanted.
 She had clashed with people like Ms. Gaede and felt judged for her personal choices, namely her decision not to have more children. She wanted to restart her embalming career, and she had discovered that she had a knack for bodybuilding, winning amateur competitions and finding community at the gym.
 People don't leave the hate movement because a veil lifts and they are suddenly able to see hate for what it is. The truth is more disappointing. They leave because it makes sense for them, because the value hate once gave them has diminished or evaporated. Ms. Olsen seemed to know this, writing once on a blog, ''The reality is, people rarely change their personality or ideals during adulthood, and if they do, it needs to be something they do on their own, for themselves.''
 When the F.B.I. offered to pay her to inform on the Northwest Front, Ms. Olsen agreed. She worked as an informant for a few months, then cut ties with hate for good in late 2012. Shortly after, in an interview with the Southern Poverty Law Center, she said, ''I realized much too late that this entire movement is a huge waste of life.''
 Just as Ms. Olsen was leaving the hate movement, it found a new source of energy. The resulting wave would wash over America, helping usher in the Trump presidency, the terrible events in Charlottesville, Va., and, in 2018, the highest number of killings attributed to right-wing extremists since the year of the Oklahoma City bombing.
 But first, it inspired Dylann Roof to commit mass murder. In the manifesto he wrote before killing nine people at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., Mr. Roof described the shooting of Trayvon Martin as the event that ''truly awakened'' his racism.
 ''I read the Wikipedia article and right away I was unable to understand what the big deal was,'' Mr. Roof wrote in 2015. ''How could the news be blowing up the Trayvon Martin case,'' he asked, ''while hundreds of these Black-on-white murders got ignored?''
 The shooting death of an unarmed Black teenager and the authorities' initial decision not to arrest the gunman, George Zimmerman, spurred protests. President Obama said, ''If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.''
 Mr. Zimmerman was ultimately charged with second-degree murder and acquitted in 2013. Three activists on Twitter created the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter. A movement was born. Backlash followed in the form of the #WhiteLivesMatter and #AllLivesMatter campaigns, and in unfounded accusations that Black Lives Matter was a radical, violent organization.
 Some prominent white supremacists now point to the birth of Black Lives Matter as a pivotal moment in their radicalization. Lana Lokteff, a white nationalist who runs the popular alt-news platform Red Ice with her husband, told me that period was when she realized ''the truth'' was ''pointing toward there being an attack on white people.'' Ms. Lokteff produces videos with titles like ''Why They Want to Replace White People'' and peddles false narratives about Black-on-white crime.
 This rhetoric is not confined to the internet's most shadowy corners. In late June, as protests against police brutality and systemic racism entered their fourth week, President Trump retweeted videos that seemed to show Black men attacking white people. Sounding eerily like Ms. Lokteff, Mr. Roof and other extremists, he demanded public outrage. Soon after, when New York City announced a plan to paint ''Black Lives Matter'' in yellow letters on Fifth Avenue, where Trump Tower sits, the president called it ''a symbol of hate.''
 All this suggests that the uprisings in the name of Black liberation are cause for optimism, but also for vigilance.
 Digital networks -- and the White House -- shovel disinformation into people's brains every minute of every day. Conspiracy theories run rampant. A pandemic is reshaping the social landscape, isolating people from one another and entrenching the worst unemployment crisis in nearly a century. The presidential election looms.
 Perhaps more people than ever will emerge from 2020 on the side of justice. Still, there are those who will turn to hate, finding it -- perversely -- to be a kind of balm.
 Research shows that a shared sense of racial identity is hardening among white Americans. The political scientist Ashley Jardina has found that some 20 percent of white Americans, roughly 40 million people, now have ''strong levels of group consciousness,'' meaning they ''feel a sense of discontent over the status of their group.'' Having group consciousness does not automatically translate into prejudice, but the hate movement is poised to exploit white people's grievances and fears.
 What can we do to stop it? There aren't easy answers. Tech companies should identify and ban hate speech, but this process inevitably becomes a game of Whac-a-Mole. Similarly, bringing the law to bear on hate speech and crimes is necessary but remedial; levying penalties for individual acts of wrongdoing won't vaccinate America against far-right extremism.
 I will confess to being a pessimist by nature, and while reporting on the hate movement, I found it difficult not to feel despondent. Magnifying my gloom were encounters with white liberals who made statements that I recognized as precisely the kind of bait white nationalists use to make their case to the mainstream.
 Standing in a breakfast buffet line, a middle-aged writer told me that I needed to be very careful with the book I was writing lest it hurt women (white ones, presumably). Of course, she said, what white-nationalist women support is wrong, but everyone is complicit in something, right? Lowering her voice, she added that America never would have had slavery if Africans hadn't sold their own people to European traders. In a tweet on July 4, Ms. Lokteff expressed the same idea more or less verbatim.
 The least Americans can ask of one another is to have frank conversations about whiteness, no matter how uncomfortable. People concerned about the tide of hate can also work to empower minority populations, tackle inequality, foster dialogue about prejudice and root discriminatory ideas out of American life. They can vote bigots out of office. They can support the work of groups like Life After Hate, which helps people leave far-right groups.
 First, though, combating hate requires understanding it. Not what it seems to be, but what it actually is. That includes who embraces it, and why.
 So much of history is made up of small moves. Hope, too, dwells in increments. There is hope if white Americans can confront the true face of hate and their own complicity in bigotry. There is hope if we can see white nationalism as a crisis of individual and collective responsibility.
 Ms. Olsen knows how hate works, because it worked on her. These days, she likes sticking it to the racists she once considered friends. She has bragged on Twitter about ordering a Black Lives Matter T-shirt to wear to the gym so that she could ''offend multiple people.''
 She had also ordered a Nike hijab. Once a seeker, always one: In 2018, Ms. Olsen decided to become a Muslim.
 She liked how the religion gave structure to her days. She liked that Islam was a topic she could learn about from books. Keeping her body covered meant that it was hers and no one else's. ''It is freeing, actually, to feel like I'm taking something away from men,'' she told me. At her mosque, the other worshipers didn't want anything from her; they just seemed glad she was there, practicing Islam alongside them.
 When she was done transporting bodies for the day, we visited the mosque. ''Sister Corinna!'' I heard several Black and brown women crow happily when they saw her. She had friends here who cared about her. Sometimes she led exercise classes in the mosque's gym, cuing women through rounds of lunges and push-ups.
 Once in a class, a call to prayer emanated from a loudspeaker. The women rushed to the middle of the gym's floor. They left their shoes in a pile and stood in a line. One used her cellphone to find the direction of Mecca. ''A little to the left!'' she instructed her classmates, and the group edged that way.
 The prayer began. Silent, the women stood hip to hip -- all except Ms. Olsen. She was at one end of the line, where she had left a gap between her body and the rest of the group. The woman closest to her glanced over. She was tall and willowy, an immigrant from Niger. She extended a hand, sending a ripple through her abaya. She grasped Ms. Olsen's arm and tugged her close.

And Then She Left.",FALSE,"The Sunday Review editor Honor Jones wrote about our decision to publish this story about the white supremacy movement in Friday’s edition of our Opinion Today newsletter.
SEATTLE — Mount Rainier bobbed in the rearview mirror as Corinna Olsen drove north. In the passenger seat, I felt a soft bump against my back whenever she pumped the brakes. It came from a human head. Behind me, wrapped in opaque plastic, was a dead body.
Ms. Olsen is an embalmer, and her Dodge minivan is retrofitted for her job — instead of seats, the back holds two gurneys. She had picked up this particular body from a county coroner’s office for transport to a funeral home. I was along for the ride because I was writing a book about hate in America, and Ms. Olsen used to be a white nationalist.
“I’ve been trying to decide which is the lesser of two evils, blacks or Mexicans,” she wrote in a post on Stormfront, the hate movement’s oldest online forum, in 2008. She went on to describe racist stereotypes, tarring Black people as criminals and saying Mexicans have too many kids.
Her language was cruel but familiar, drawing from America’s communal well of white supremacy. Many white Americans are quick to distinguish between everyday prejudice and radical bigotry, but it’s a false distinction. White nationalists make explicit ideas that are already coded or veiled in the wider white imagination. Hate is what many people would see if they looked in a fun-house mirror: a distorted but still recognizable reflection.
It is important to acknowledge this ugly truth if we hope to understand events now unfolding across the country.
Thousands of white people are joining protests against police brutality. Polls show a surge of support for the Black Lives Matter movement, and three-quarters of Americans believe racial discrimination is a serious problem, a 25-point jump from five years ago. These developments are heartening in a country that has refused a meaningful reckoning with racism for the last 400 years.
It would be a mistake, however, to assume that this moment heralds a future of unprecedented harmony.
There are questions about whether white lip service will translate into sustained anti-racist action, and about what the same people who condemn unlawful killings of Black Americans might have to say about less violent manifestations of racism, ones that benefit them. There is also the inevitability of backlash: History shows that there are always people who turn to hate in the very moments that others find hope.
There are nearly 1,000 hate groups in America, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, and the distribution of white-supremacist propaganda is ever widening. We know little about how to combat hate effectively; the federal government has cut funding for programs to counter right-wing extremism and blocked the dissemination of data on the subject. Only last year did the Department of Homeland Security acknowledge that white supremacy is a national security threat.
The gaps in knowledge mean that journalists and politicians often rely on flawed assumptions — for instance, that white nationalism is the sole province of angry men. Men are the far right’s most recognizable evangelists, and bombings, shootings and rallies are the most obvious manifestations of the movement’s strength. But there is other work keeping the flames of hate alive, and it is often done by women. Women like Corinna Olsen.
Ms. Olsen became an embalmer in her late 20s because, in a way, she had to. Divorced with two kids, she needed to make money. She had never finished college and did not have any demonstrable professional skills. But she had always been fascinated by rituals and what she calls “the misunderstood”— subjects that are taboo or macabre. Embalming fit the bill.
Ms. Olsen also had a personal connection to the profession because of her younger brother, Harley. He was fun, outgoing, well-liked — everything she was not. Ms. Olsen had always struggled to connect with other people and to be understood.
At 20, Harley drowned in a boating accident on Oregon’s Crescent Lake. Ms. Olsen was never able to look at his body. It took the authorities more than a year to recover it, and then he was cremated. As an embalmer, Ms. Olsen decided to specialize in difficult cases — gunshot victims, bodies charred in fires, corpses with battered and broken faces — to give families one last chance to see, maybe even to recognize, their loved ones.
Harley also inadvertently introduced Ms. Olsen to white nationalism. On what would have been his 27th birthday, in 2008, she found herself wanting to know more about her brother and the things that had mattered to him. He had been an anarchist who listened to punk music, wore black combat boots and hung out with skinheads in studded leather jackets. So Ms. Olsen went online and typed in, “What are skinheads?”
She told me that she had no idea at the time that some skinheads were neo-Nazis. That’s hard to believe, but similar explanations came up often in our conversations about her time in the hate movement. When she said that she hadn’t known any better, I didn’t get the impression that she hoped I would feel sorry for her. (I didn’t.) Rather, she seemed to be saying that she knew she’d been an idiot. She should have known better and could have, if she’d cared to think more critically.
Ms. Olsen had never thought too hard about being white. Like many white Americans, she never had to. She grew up in a largely white school district in Eugene, Ore., and she did not interact meaningfully with people of other races until her late 20s, when she moved to Portland for her embalming career. She had paid such little mind to race as a concept that there was a flatness to her understanding of it, a one-dimensionality susceptible to simplified reasoning.
When her search for information about skinheads led straight to Stormfront, the racist bowels of the internet, Ms. Olsen wasn’t fazed. Some Stormfront users said vile and violent things, but others talked about white pride and heritage.
And that didn’t seem bad to her. Black people could celebrate their roots, Hispanic people, too. It stood to reason, Ms. Olsen thought, that white people should be able to do the same. Stormfront users presented this as if it were a mathematical proof, not a notion freighted with a racist, violent history.
Ms. Olsen wrote a post introducing herself and asking, “Is there something wrong with being a white supremacist? I don’t outwardly profess hatred for other races; I have to work with them and also serve clients of other races in my industry, and I am very good at what I do. I don’t advocate violence toward other races.” She continued, “What is wrong with seeing our race as superior to that of the blacks? Don’t we all?”
The responses were plentiful and affirming. “There is nothing wrong with having a personal opinion,” one read. A commenter with the handle Thoughtful Patriot wrote, “Let’s face reality: People self-segregate by race.” Race, the person added, “is an intrinsic part of who we are.”
To Ms. Olsen, these people seemed smart. Just as important, she told me, “they seemed immensely interested in me and my life, and they wanted to be my friend.” To someone who “grew up without friends, that was very appealing. It made me feel like I must be doing something right.”
She wasn’t always sure that she believed what she said when she echoed her new friends’ views, but what mattered was that they wanted to keep talking to her; all she had to do was log in and start typing. If playing a part graduated to instinct, maybe they would like her even more.
The most basic definition of hate is personal animus, but there is a more useful, and frightening, description: Hate is a social bond — a shared currency — and it abhors a vacuum.
Kathleen Blee, a sociologist and expert in “racist activism,” writes that “social camaraderie, a desire for simple answers to complex political problems, or even the opportunity to take action against formidable social forces can coexist with, even substitute for, hatred as the reason for participation in organized racist activities.”
So can a need for validation, visibility and purpose. For someone like Ms. Olsen, hate becomes a cure for loneliness.
People who are drawn to the hate movement have an acute desire to make sense of their place in the world. There’s a gap between who they are and who they think they should be, what they have and what they want. They want to seize or regain what they believe is a rightful status. They want empowerment, with minimal effort. Hate promises them that.
The movement’s appeal goes something like this: America is a white country, built by white people, that is under attack from the enemies of the white race. The time is now or never to forestall racial annihilation. Anyone can do that by embracing white pride, standing up for the well-being of white people and securing America’s future by having white children. Whoever joins the movement will be part of something greater than themselves, a “righteous” cause.
“Who doesn’t want to lead people to victory?” Ms. Olsen asked me.
Hate always exists, but it surges during periods of social upheaval, offering racist explanations for seismic change.
The Ku Klux Klan formed after the Civil War and reached its zenith in the 1920s, in an expanding, diversifying country. “Its allures were manifold,” the historian Linda Gordon writes of the Klan. “They included the rewards of being an insider, of belonging to a community, of expressing and acting on resentments, of participating in drama, of feeling religiously and morally righteous, of turning a profit.”
White Citizens’ Councils and other organs of resistance emerged in reaction to the civil rights movement. Hate fed on opposition to second- and third-wave feminism, the expansion of L.G.B.T.Q. rights, and shifting racial demographics.
Then came the election of President Barack Obama. “Right-wing extremists are harnessing this historical election as a recruitment tool,” a Homeland Security report noted in 2009. The first year of Mr. Obama’s presidency, Stormfront registered nearly 100,000 new users.
Ms. Olsen was part of this wave, which also found fuel in the xenophobia of the post-Sept. 11 era and public disgust with the financial crisis. Her involvement accelerated quickly. Some of her online friends asked to meet in real life, and by 2009, she was the head of Portland’s chapter of the National Socialist Movement. She read “Mein Kampf,” donned a uniform with Nazi insignia for meetings, and placed recruitment fliers with phrases like “Jewish people are ruining America” on windshields in parking lots.
In November 2009, she traveled with fellow neo-Nazis to Phoenix to attend a rally demanding a halt to the immigration of anyone who was not white. Participants also wanted to expel nonwhite people already in America. The rally’s theme was “America First,” a slogan once used by isolationist politicians and the Klan that, several years later, Mr. Trump would invoke in his campaign for the White House.
Ms. Olsen’s embalming career faltered and she all but lost contact with her children as she went deeper into the movement. In 2010, she left Portland for Montana, where she moved in with a white nationalist named April Gaede, best known as the stage mom of Prussian Blue, blond twin girls who made national headlines for playing racist music. The duo’s name was a reference to the color of the residue left — or not left, according to Holocaust deniers — by Zyklon B in Nazi gas chambers.
After a few months, Ms. Olsen had a falling out with Ms. Gaede and relocated to Seattle, where she started working for the Northwest Front, a group that promoted the establishment of a white homeland in the Pacific Northwest. She soon gained notoriety as the co-host of Radio Free Northwest, a weekly broadcast, under the name “Axis Sally.” It was a reference to Mildred Gillars, an American woman living in Germany who was handpicked by Joseph Goebbels to spread propaganda on Nazi radio to Allied troops in Europe. Gillars was later convicted of treason.
Being Axis Sally gave Gillars, a struggling actress, a platform, popularity and power. It did the same for Ms. Olsen. She became briefly famous enough for a Gawker profile in 2010: “The internet is full of strange people,” it read. Ms. Olsen “may be the strangest.”
Many people rationalize their racism — or even refuse to call it that — by insisting that it isn’t as bad as someone else’s. They could spit on immigrants instead of complaining in private about foreigners stealing American jobs. They could put Jewish people in camps instead of muttering about how they have too much power.
Bigotry has many branches, some bigger and stronger than others, but they all derive from the same trunk. No wonder, then, that when “somebody said he didn’t like Black people, or he told a racist joke, or he said illegal immigration is wrong,” Ms. Olsen recalled, she assumed he might be interested in becoming a neo-Nazi, too.
There were, however, lines Ms. Olsen said she wouldn’t cross. In 2011, she decided she was done with white nationalism. That January, the police in Spokane disarmed a pipe bomb left on a bench along the route of a parade for Martin Luther King’s Birthday. The bomb contained 128 fishing weights coated with rat poison, which impedes blood clotting, and human feces, which teem with infection-causing bacteria. The engineer was Kevin Harpham, an Army veteran and neo-Nazi who frequented the same kinds of online forums Ms. Olsen did.
Mr. Harpham would plead guilty to attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and to a hate crime. He said in court that he had intended for the bomb to be a protest against multiculturalism. It was also a gesture to fellow white nationalists. When people plant bombs, burn crosses, or run their cars into crowds of peaceful protesters, they are reinforcing their place in a community by inflicting terror.
In her telling, Ms. Olsen decided to leave the hate movement because she realized that she could not tolerate violence. That may have been part of it, but when I spoke to her, it was clear that she also exited because the movement stopped giving her the meaning and camaraderie she wanted.
She had clashed with people like Ms. Gaede and felt judged for her personal choices, namely her decision not to have more children. She wanted to restart her embalming career, and she had discovered that she had a knack for bodybuilding, winning amateur competitions and finding community at the gym.
People don’t leave the hate movement because a veil lifts and they are suddenly able to see hate for what it is. The truth is more disappointing. They leave because it makes sense for them, because the value hate once gave them has diminished or evaporated. Ms. Olsen seemed to know this, writing once on a blog, “The reality is, people rarely change their personality or ideals during adulthood, and if they do, it needs to be something they do on their own, for themselves.”
When the F.B.I. offered to pay her to inform on the Northwest Front, Ms. Olsen agreed. She worked as an informant for a few months, then cut ties with hate for good in late 2012. Shortly after, in an interview with the Southern Poverty Law Center, she said, “I realized much too late that this entire movement is a huge waste of life.”
Just as Ms. Olsen was leaving the hate movement, it found a new source of energy. The resulting wave would wash over America, helping usher in the Trump presidency, the terrible events in Charlottesville, Va., and, in 2018, the highest number of killings attributed to right-wing extremists since the year of the Oklahoma City bombing.
But first, it inspired Dylann Roof to commit mass murder. In the manifesto he wrote before killing nine people at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., Mr. Roof described the shooting of Trayvon Martin as the event that “truly awakened” his racism.
“I read the Wikipedia article and right away I was unable to understand what the big deal was,” Mr. Roof wrote in 2015. “How could the news be blowing up the Trayvon Martin case,” he asked, “while hundreds of these Black-on-white murders got ignored?”
The shooting death of an unarmed Black teenager and the authorities’ initial decision not to arrest the gunman, George Zimmerman, spurred protests. President Obamasaid, “If I had a son, he’d look like Trayvon.”
Mr. Zimmerman was ultimately charged with second-degree murder and acquitted in 2013. Three activists on Twitter created the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter. A movement was born. Backlash followed in the form of the #WhiteLivesMatter and #AllLivesMatter campaigns, and in unfounded accusations that Black Lives Matter was a radical, violent organization.
Some prominent white supremacists now point to the birth of Black Lives Matter as a pivotal moment in their radicalization. Lana Lokteff, a white nationalist who runs the popular alt-news platform Red Ice with her husband, told me that period was when she realized “the truth” was “pointing toward there being an attack on white people.” Ms. Lokteff produces videos with titles like “Why They Want to Replace White People” and peddles false narratives about Black-on-white crime.
This rhetoric is not confined to the internet’s most shadowy corners. In late June, as protests against police brutality and systemic racism entered their fourth week, President Trump retweeted videos that seemed to show Black men attacking white people. Sounding eerily like Ms. Lokteff, Mr. Roof and other extremists, he demanded public outrage. Soon after, when New York City announced a plan to paint “Black Lives Matter” in yellow letters on Fifth Avenue, where Trump Tower sits, the president called it “a symbol of hate.”
All this suggests that the uprisings in the name of Black liberation are cause for optimism, but also for vigilance.
Digital networks — and the White House — shovel disinformation into people’s brains every minute of every day. Conspiracy theories run rampant. A pandemic is reshaping the social landscape, isolating people from one another and entrenching the worst unemployment crisis in nearly a century. The presidential election looms.
Perhaps more people than ever will emerge from 2020 on the side of justice. Still, there are those who will turn to hate, finding it — perversely — to be a kind of balm.
Research shows that a shared sense of racial identity is hardening among white Americans. The political scientist Ashley Jardina has found that some 20 percent of white Americans, roughly 40 million people, now have “strong levels of group consciousness,” meaning they “feel a sense of discontent over the status of their group.” Having group consciousness does not automatically translate into prejudice, but the hate movement is poised to exploit white people’s grievances and fears.
What can we do to stop it? There aren’t easy answers. Tech companies should identify and ban hate speech, but this process inevitably becomes a game of Whac-a-Mole. Similarly, bringing the law to bear on hate speech and crimes is necessary but remedial; levying penalties for individual acts of wrongdoing won’t vaccinate America against far-right extremism.
I will confess to being a pessimist by nature, and while reporting on the hate movement, I found it difficult not to feel despondent. Magnifying my gloom were encounters with white liberals who made statements that I recognized as precisely the kind of bait white nationalists use to make their case to the mainstream.
Standing in a breakfast buffet line, a middle-aged writer told me that I needed to be very careful with the book I was writing lest it hurt women (white ones, presumably). Of course, she said, what white-nationalist women support is wrong, but everyone is complicit in something, right? Lowering her voice, she added that America never would have had slavery if Africans hadn’t sold their own people to European traders. In a tweet on July 4, Ms. Lokteff expressed the same idea more or less verbatim.
The least Americans can ask of one another is to have frank conversations about whiteness, no matter how uncomfortable. People concerned about the tide of hate can also work to empower minority populations, tackle inequality, foster dialogue about prejudice and root discriminatory ideas out of American life. They can vote bigots out of office. They can support the work of groups like Life After Hate, which helps people leave far-right groups.
First, though, combating hate requires understanding it. Not what it seems to be, but what it actually is. That includes who embraces it, and why.
So much of history is made up of small moves. Hope, too, dwells in increments. There is hope if white Americans can confront the true face of hate and their own complicity in bigotry. There is hope if we can see white nationalism as a crisis of individual and collective responsibility.

Rishi Sunak chose to use, rather than frozen. There were some elements of that but the big message was this is a big amount of money, it is still going up and this will set the scene for the next few years. And how much unhappiness are you picking up on, in terms of that well trailed cut to overseas development? We knew it was coming, we thought it was coming anyway, but there is a lot of unhappiness, even within the government because my own party and its own backbenchers. 
Yes, they were unhappy before and they are unhappy now that Rishi Sunak has confirmed that they are going to cut what is a legally binding target on spending 0.7% of gross national income on development spending, foreign aid. Rishi Sunak is going to reduce that this year cannot .5%. The Treasury saying it is temporary, depending on the fiscal situation, it should return the following year to 0.7%. But as you said, there has been a lot of backlash. We have seen already the resignation of one Conservative minister, a minister in the fair office, Baroness Noakes, who resigned, saying that -- Baroness Suggs, who said this is an unprecedented global crisis. Lots of concern, Tory MP after Tory MP getting up to express concern about the impact on the world's poorest, as Labour did, the Shadow Chancellor did come as the SNP have done. There is a lot of concern about this, and we will hear about that, not just from the impacts of those in poorer countries but also I think there is a bit of concern about what it says about Britain at a time when the UK is trying to really establish its place in the world. Thank you Helen Catt for now. Just coming up to 18 minutes past 40. The headlines on BBC News... The cost of coronavirus - The Chancellor paints the true scale of the economic crisis facing the country - with the economy due to contract by 11.4% - the biggest fall in output in over 300 years. A pay freeze in England for just under half of public sector workers - Labour describes it a 'sledgehammer blow' for consumer confidence. Unemployment is forecast to hit 7.5% next year - leaving 2.6 million people out of work. Police in the West Midlands say they are investigating an alleged attack by secondary school pupils in Telford as a hate crime. West Mercia Police says it's aware of a video circulating on social media, which appears to show a pupil from the Sikh community being pushed by two other boys before being struck a number of times in the head while on the ground. The force has described it as a deeply distressing incident, which it is treating with the utmost seriousness. The Equality and Human Rights Commission says the Home Office unlawfully ignored warnings that changes to immigration rules would create ""serious injustices"" for the Windrush generation. A report has concluded that the ""hostile environment"" policy, designed to deter ""irregular"" migrants from settling, has the effect of harming many people who were already living in the UK. It says there was a disproportionate impact on people from Caribbean countries. The Windrush generation came from the Caribbean to the UK from 1948 to 1971. The Home Office said it was determined to ""right the wrongs suffered"" by them. The Duchess of Sussex has revealed she suffered a miscarriage in July. Writing in the New York Times, Meghan Markle said it had happened while she was caring for her son, Archie - adding that the loss of a child was an almost unbearable grief, experienced by many but talked about by few. Our Royal Correspondent Nicholas Witchell reports. They are both thought to have been keen to have another child, after their son Archie's birth in May of last year. Earlier this year at their home in California, Meghan was pregnant. But then, as she has described in an article in the New York Times, one morning in July she felt a sudden cramp. ""I knew as I clutched my first born child that I was losing my second. She describes the tears she and Harry both shed and goes on, ""losing a child means carrying an almost unbearable grief. Experienced by many, but talked about by few"". It is worth pointing out that the miscarriage itself happened in July at a time where, you know, they were not out of the headlines. You know, royal biographies being written about them."

With Democrats boycotting the hearing, the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee voted to authorize the legal orders if Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter's Jack Dorsey did not agree to testify voluntarily. The committee wants to hear from them about ""the suppression and/or censorship of two news articles from the New York Post,"" according to the subpoena document. Senators also want information from the executives about their companies' policies for moderating content ""that may interfere"" with federal elections. 
Representatives of Facebook and Twitter declined comment. The urgency ratcheted higher Thursday as U.S. officials said Russian hackers have targeted the networks of dozens of state and local governments in recent days, stealing data from at least two servers. The revelation was certain to stoke fears that Americans' confidence in the Nov. 3 election results could be undermined. Russia backed President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign through hacking of Democratic emails and a covert social media campaign. Facebook became an unwitting conduit for misinformation and election disruption. Facebook and Twitter acted last week to limit the online dissemination and sharing of an unverified political story from the conservative-leaning New York Post that targeted Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. The story, which other publications have not confirmed, cited unverified emails from Biden's son Hunter that were reportedly disclosed by Trump's allies. One email purported to show a top adviser for Burisma, the Ukraine gas company where Hunter Biden held a board seat, thanking Biden for giving him an opportunity to meet the elder Biden, who was vice president at the time. Trump's campaign seized on the report, though the account raised more questions than answers, including whether emails at the center of the story were hacked or fabricated. The FBI is investigating whether the emails are part of a foreign influence operation. It was the first time in recent memory that the two social media platforms enforced rules against misinformation on a story from a mainstream media publication. With the election looming, Facebook and Twitter have scrambled to stem the tide of material seen as potentially inciting violence and spreading disinformation and baseless conspiracy theories. Facebook has expanded its restrictions on political advertising, including new bans on messages claiming widespread voter fraud. Trump has raised the prospect of mass fraud in the vote-by-mail process. The companies also have wrestled with how strongly they should intervene in speech on their platforms. With Trump leading the way, conservatives have stepped up their claims that Facebook, Twitter and Google, which owns YouTube, are biased, charging without evidence Silicon Valley's social media platforms are deliberately suppressing conservative views. The Justice Department has asked Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms. Trump signed an executive order this year challenging the protections from lawsuits under a 1996 telecommunications law that has served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet. The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation, on a bipartisan vote, recently authorized subpoenas for Zuckerberg, Dorsey and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. The three have agreed to testify for a hearing planned for next week. Democrats have focused their criticism of social media mainly on hate speech, misinformation and other content that they say can incite violence or keep people from voting. They have criticized the CEOs for failing to police content, focusing on the platforms' role in hate crimes and the rise of white nationalism in the United States. In 2017, following the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, tech giants began banning extremist groups and individuals espousing white supremacist views and support for violence. Facebook extended the ban to white nationalists. From both political parties, the companies have come under increasing scrutiny in Washington and from state attorneys general over issues of competition, consumer privacy and hate speech. On Tuesday, the Justice Department filed a landmark antitrust case against Google, accusing it of abusing its dominance in online search and advertising to boost profits. It was the government's most significant attempt to protect competition since the groundbreaking case against Microsoft more than 20 years ago. Facebook, Amazon and Apple also have been targets of antitrust investigations by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission.

The incident happened in Manhattan, amid the growing unrest over the death of George Floyd and the ongoing coronavirus crisis.Minding Her Own BusinessThe video[1] shows the elderly lady walking with a pushcart around 3:30 p.m. Friday (June 12)on Third Avenue, a short distance from East 16th Street in the Gramercy Park area. The woman was walking with her back to the camera while the still unidentified youth was going in the opposite direction.When they were about one meter or less from each other, the young man suddenly struck his arm and closed fist to his left side, hitting the 92-year-old woman on the side of her head. 
Apparently unprepared with the force that hit her, the old lady staggered and fell to the concrete sidewalk, narrowly missing the steel fire hydrant nearby. elderly woman falls on NYC sidewalk after hit by brute Photo: StockSnap - Pixabay Froze In DisbeliefThe surveillance footage also shows there was one witness to the shocking incident. The unnamed witness was walking behind the unidentified youth and appeared to freeze in disbelief as the scene of an elderly woman collapsing after being struck unfoldsbefore his eyes. The ruthless assailant, on the other hand, continues to calmly walk away as if it was nothing. After walking a few meters from his victim, he looked back at the old woman lying on the ground and in obvious pain. He then went on his wayuntil he disappeared from the camera's view. Reports[2] say the elderly lady sustained some injuries from the attack but is expected to fully recover.Violent TrendsAccording to reports, the recent incident appears to have traces of a trend in 2017, which came to be known as the 'knockout game.' This trend or 'game' involves a person or group of individuals suddenly attacking a random stranger walking on the street. Many people have been involved in those incidents at the time. They were subsequently arrested and slapped with hate-crime charges.In the case of last Friday's assault, authorities still have to establish a motive. As of Monday, news reports say the attacker is still on the loose. In the video, he was seen wearing a purple or blue shirt and multicolored shorts.Update:An updated NYPost report[3] says the brute that attacked an elderly woman by hitting her as they walked opposite each other on a sidewalk in NYC was apprehended by the police Tuesday morning. In a Twitter post, Police Commissioner Dermot Shea wrote: 'Thanks to the outstanding work of @NYPDDetectives, this suspect has been apprehended.' According to the police, the man is Rashid Brimmage, a 31-year-old convicted sex offender. He also has been arrested more than 100 times in the past.

* * *
LatinoJustice PRLDEF in December 2008 shortly after the hate crime murder of Marcello Lucero in Long Island filed a petition with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights concerning a series of racialized violence and hate crimes fostered by an anti-immigrant climate espoused by the U.S. government, local officials and news media. After ten years, the Commission in February 2019 issued a report substantiating many of the petition's claims in advancing the petition to a merits hearing. LatinoJustice in
""Unfortunately, not much has changed in the past 12 years since we filed this petition to address numerous human rights violations committed within the U.S. with the complicity of the state.
We have filed a supplemental report highlighting the proliferating increase of racist violence being perpetrated against Latinxs under the Trump administration, both by private actors emboldened by the inflammatory and divisive rhetoric and behavior by the President and other members of his administration, as well as by law enforcement who have made the Latinx community a primary target for discriminatory policing and enforcement policies.
""LatinoJustice's submission reflects the Trump administration's coordinated effort to create a narrative of criminality concerning Latinxs that criminalizes their presence, activities and movement in order to justify racialized government violence and policies that are designed to terrorize our communities.""
BACKGROUND:
After a series of heinous hate crime murders committed against Latinos including Luis Ramirez in Shenandoah, Pa, Marcello Lucero in Long Island, NY, and Jose Zuchazany in Brooklyn, NY, LatinoJustice filed a petition the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in December 2008. After ten years of review, and overruling objections submitted by the United States, the Commission in February 2019 granted the petition finding that it satisfied all jurisdictional requirements, and substantiated the charges alleging multiple human rights violations by the United States for failing to protect Latinx residents within its borders from racialized hate crimes. The Commission admitted the petition for further hearing on the merits.
LatinoJustice's petition had cited the increasing anti-immigrant federal government policies under then-President Bush, which resulted in a series of fatal hate crime attacks against Latinx immigrants in the wake of the daily anti-immigrant vitriol being spewed by political pundits. Unfortunately, we have not departed far from that moment in time, given the xenophobic racist government policies promulgated by President Trump since taking office that have outraged and shocked the nation are only a continuation of long-standing policies towards the Latinx immigrant community.
The United States under the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man, adopted 60 years ago by the members of the Organization of American States, of which the U.S. is a founding member and host nation has an international obligation to ensure the safety of all those who reside within its borders.

215,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_751/Files (250).DOCX","Newstex Blogs",2020-08-14,"1544 words",NA,"Sydney Pereira",NA,"Don't Count On Getting Trump's Unemployment Checks Anytime Soon, If At All",FALSE,"Aug 14, 2020( Gothamist: http://www.gothamist.com/ Delivered by Newstex) Out-of-work Americans have found themselves ""back to square one[1],"" as Congress failed to extend the $600 weekly pandemic relief payments that expired two weeks ago. In response, President Donald Trump said he would bypass the legislature with a highly dubious[2] executive action restoring the payments to $400 a week[3].When Trump announced the $44 billion program, he called it ""generous,""[4] and then blamed Democrats for lack of legislative action and China for the economic fallout resulting from the health crisis (an oft-repeated trope seen as tied to a rise in hate crimes against East Asians[5]). His Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said[6] most states could execute the brand new program ""within the week or two.""But the checks could take weeks to end up in people's bank accounts, if they arrive at all. And they may end up being just $300.""I don't think [people] can expect much of anything right away,"" George Wentworth, the senior counsel with the National Employment Law Project, told Gothamist.The program overhauls the previous Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation program, replacing it with a new one, dubbed Lost Wages Assistance.The Labor Department would work with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to direct up to $44 billion in emergency disaster relief funds to states via grant agreements[7].Getting the money from the federal government to the states and into people's bank accounts could take until at least September, particularly as state labor departments, including New York, saw outdated systems slammed[8] under the early waves[9] of applications from those who lost work due to the pandemic. 
States rushed to catch up to the increased demand[10] for unemployment money, but the new program would call for a whole new system.The Lost Wages Assistance program would also have a new eligibility requirement that would omit workers making less than $100 a week under regular unemployment insurance. That would prevent part-time workers from receiving the federal boost.And that's if states choose to willingly participate— under Trump's plan, they would have to pay for $100 of the total $400 payment—something Governor Andrew Cuomo has called ""impossible"" and ""laughable.""[11] Cuomo estimates the cost on the state would be another $4.2 billion, while the state is already sitting in a $30 billion two-year budget shortfall with mass cuts[12] to schools[13] and healthcare looming.In New York, that cost ""is a very significant additional burden for the state's budget that's already been suffering,"" said chief economist with the Fiscal Policy Institute Jonas Schaende.State labor departments could use previously allocated federal COVID-19 funds to make up the $100, or just count standard state unemployment benefits towards that portion. If the state chooses the latter, the extra payment would be $300.Earlier this week, Cuomo speculated the memorandum would be challenged in court.""I think there is serious legal questions to be challenged and no one will get anything and the situation will get even worse,"" Cuomo said during a press call. ""Your solution is to cost me $4 billion? Thank you. That is handing the drowning man an anchor.""Trump's program is supposed to last through December 27th, or until the $44 billion runs out. But Wentworth says based on how many people were collecting benefits previously, the program would last about five weeks.""The pandemic has really laid bare what rough shape the nation's unemployment insurance program is in,"" Wentworth said. Adding another program with ""questionable legal authority, unaccounted-for administrative costs, and new eligibility rules"" is irresponsible, he noted.""It's unfair to raise hopes of unemployed workers that it's going to mean any real assistance anytime soon,"" he said.The state's Department of Labor deferred to Cuomo's earlier statements, when asked about if the department is moving ahead on taking those federal funds, or opting out.In a message to people collecting unemployment payments, the department urged New Yorkers to continue certifying weekly.""We understand there may be confusion following the President's announcement about additional unemployment benefits. While open questions about this announcement are resolved, please continue to certify weekly to ensure you receive your Unemployment Insurance (UI) or Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) benefits,"" the message says[14].The National Governors Association, now chaired by Cuomo, urged[15] Congress and the White House to reach a ""quick resolution to provide immediate assistance to unemployed Americans,"" and said the current proposal would place ""significant administrative burdens and costs"" on already cash-strapped states.Trump's program would expire if a deal through Congress were passed, the memo says. But negotiations between the administration and Congress continue to go nowhere[16].House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Wednesday that the White House ""is not budging"" on the size of a new stimulus package. ""Repeatedly, we have made clear to the Administration that we are willing to come down $1 trillion [to $2 trillion] if they will come up $1 trillion,"" they said in a statement[17].Mnuchin said[18] it was Pelosi who was ""unwilling to meet to continue negotiations unless we agreed in advance to her proposal costing at least $2 trillion.""While the administration and congressional leaders argue, roughly one-third of New York City workers don't have jobs[19], higher than the typically used official estimate, according to a new report.Though the official unemployment rate was about 20.4 percent in June, nearly one-third (32.7 percent) of the city's February labor force were collecting unemployment benefits that month, according the report[20] from The New School's Center for New York City Affairs. The report calculated the higher unemployment rate by percentage of those collecting unemployment benefits from the city's February labor force—rather than a survey based on whether a jobless worker had looked for a job in a given week.The out-of-work percentages are higher in the Bronx (40.2 percent), Brooklyn (34.1 percent) and Queens (36.9 percent).Economist James Parrott, who co-authored the report, called Trump's action for those unemployed ""for show.""""If [Trump] were serious about doing something, he would have pressed his Republican colleagues to seriously negotiate with Democrats, and we'd have a bill, so [it's] not a serious proposal,"" Parrott said.Schaende, with the Fiscal Policy Institute, said that waiting for a different solution isn't viable for millions of unemployed people who need relief now.""Their own family budgets just got significantly reduced, and so they may not be able to meet their obligations like rent, car payments, food, et cetera, and so this is not an abstract conversation,"" Schaende said. ""I don't think that [the decision makers] have the incentive to just sit there and wait until something new comes along. Even if the unemployed get a reduced amount, it would still go to help them and their families to sustain their level of consumption until something new is worked out.""With reporting contributed from WNYC's Mirela Iverac.

216,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_751/Files (250).DOCX","Impact News Service",2020-10-02,"495 words",NA,NA,NA,"Durbin Attempts To Pass House-Passed Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act On Senate Floor",FALSE,"Washington: Office of the Senator Dick Durbin has issued the following news release:
Following President Donald Trump’s refusal to condemn white supremacists during the course of Tuesday night’s Presidential debate, U.S Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) today made a unanimous consent (UC) request to immediately pass the House-passed Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act of 2020. Last week, on a unanimous vote, the U.S House of Representatives passed the House companion to Durbin’s Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act of 2020. The bill would enhance the federal government’s efforts to prevent domestic terrorism by requiring federal law enforcement agencies to regularly assess this threat, focus their resources on the most significant domestic terrorism threats, and provide training and resources to assist state, local, and tribal law enforcement in addressing these threats.
U.S Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI) objected on behalf of Senate Republicans.
“The President couldn’t find an answer two days ago. Today, we get a Republican objection to continue in a bipartisan basis, as they did in the House, to address this issue. It is a sad moment. I do believe the Senator from Wisconsin and many others when they say that they are against extremists. They had a chance to prove it. They objected,” Durbin said.
Along with Durbin, Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Doug Jones (D-AL), and Cory Booker (D-NJ) also spoke on the Senate floor in support of passing the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act of 2020.
Video of Durbin’s remarks on the Senate floor is available here.
Audio of Durbin’s remarks on the Senate floor is available here.
Footage of Durbin’s remarks on the Senate floor is available here for TV Stations.
Since May 2019, Durbin has led two letters to Attorney General Bill Barr and FBI Director Chris Wray, asking them to support the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act and asking what the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the FBI are doing to combat the growing threat of white supremacist violence targeting religious minorities and communities of color. In January, Durbin again pressed DOJ and FBI to take the initiative in leading a coordinated nationwide effort by federal, state, and local law enforcement and intelligence agencies to disrupt and prevent these violent domestic terrorism and hate crime incidents before they take place.
On September 17, FBI Director Christopher Wray testified to Congress that “the top threat we face from domestic violent extremists stems from those we identify as racially/ethnically motivated violent extremists (RMVE)” and that most of these are white supremacists.

MANILA -- President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines has pardoned an American Marine convicted of killing a transgender woman, just days after his office blocked a court order to free the service member, the Philippine foreign secretary said on Monday. 
 The decision to release the Marine, Lance Cpl. Joseph Scott Pemberton, angered both Philippine nationalist groups that oppose the country's military agreements with the United States and advocates for gay and transgender rights who said Mr. Duterte had shown leniency toward a hate crime.
 Lance Corporal Pemberton, then 20, was convicted of homicide in 2015 for the killing of Jennifer Laude, 26. He was sentenced to six to 12 years in prison -- a term that was later reduced to 10 years -- and has since been held at Camp Aguinaldo, the Philippine military headquarters in metropolitan Manila.
 The foreign minister, Teodoro Locsin Jr., said on Twitter that to ''do justice,'' Mr. Duterte had granted an ''absolute pardon,'' effectively reducing the Marine's sentence to time served.
 Mr. Duterte defended his decision in a public address on Monday. ''If there is a time when you are called upon to be fair, be fair,'' he said.
 Mr. Duterte's spokesman, Harry Roque, said that Mr. Duterte had no intention of forgiving Lance Corporal Pemberton.
 ''The president has erased whatever punishment that Pemberton still faced,'' Mr. Roque said. ''What was never erased in the mind of the president is the conviction of Pemberton, who is a killer.''
 Mr. Roque, who once served as counsel to Ms. Laude's family, said that the president had taken the action in the interest of an ''independent foreign policy where he is a friend to everyone, an enemy to none.''
 The move could help mend relations with the United States after years in which Mr. Duterte has been gravitating toward China, despite Beijing's increasingly hostile actions in the South China Sea, where the two countries have territorial disputes.
 In February, he threatened to scrap the Visiting Forces Agreement with the United States, though he reversed his stand in June.
 Renato Reyes Jr., of the nationalist group Bayan, said the pardon was clearly a political accommodation to the United States, which has been helping to check China's rising aggression in the region.
 ''The absolute pardon comes months after Duterte reversed the early pronouncement of the termination of the V.F.A.,'' Mr. Reyes said, referring to the Visiting Forces Agreement. ''The Philippine president has restored the V.F.A. to please the Americans.''
 ''The U.S. government had its way again on this issue,'' he added.
 Last week, the Olongapo City Regional Trial Court granted an appeal from Lance Corporal Pemberton and directed the Bureau of Corrections to release him.
 The court reasoned that he had served almost six years, including the time between his arrest and conviction, and that he had exceeded the 10 years when a ''good conduct time allowance'' was added. The Laude family has also received $100,000 in civil damages.
 The Marine met Ms. Laude in a nightclub in Olongapo City, about 100 miles north of Manila, in October 2014 while he was in the Philippines for joint military exercises.
 According to closed circuit television footage presented at his trial, they entered a hotel room together but the Marine left alone shortly after. Ms. Laude was found dead in the room by a hotel worker, who testified that she was slumped over the toilet, apparently with a broken neck.
 UP Babaylan, a group representing the L.G.B.T. community in the Philippines and the region, harshly criticized Mr. Duterte for freeing ''his fellow murderer, Pemberton.'' It was alluding to the president's antidrug war, which has left thousands of people dead since 2016.
 ''This is a direct attack not just on Jennifer and her family but to every trans person and every victim of corrupt and unequal justice system,'' the group said.
 Virginia Lacsa Suarez, a lawyer for Ms. Laude's family, said the pardon made a mockery of judicial and legal systems in the Philippines.
 ''There is so much disrespect in the manner by which Jennifer was killed -- reflective of the disrespect the U.S. has for the Philippines' democracy and sovereignty,'' she said.

A white man charged with second-degree murder in the fatal shooting of an unarmed Black man who had been panhandling in a Trader Joe’s parking lot in Louisiana was released on bail on Thursday, intensifying calls from the victim’s family to investigate the killing as a hate crime.
On the evening of Aug. 22, Danny Buckley, 61, approached several people in the shopping center parking lot in Baton Rouge to ask for money, according to an arrest warrant affidavit. One of them was Jace Boyd, 24.
The two men got into a verbal altercation, the authorities said, as Mr. Boyd was sitting in his car. When Mr. Buckley asked a young woman for money, Mr. Boyd yelled at him to leave people alone and got out of his car, the police said.
As Mr. Buckley moved toward him, Mr. Boyd drew a gun and attempted to fire, but it misfired, according to the affidavit. “The suspect then manipulated the firearm, in order to place another bullet in the chamber, by cycling the firearm’s slide,” the affidavit said. Mr. Boyd then fired one bullet into Mr. Buckley’s left abdomen, it said.
The police noted that Mr. Buckley was not within reach of Mr. Boyd.
When the police arrived, Mr. Boyd maintained that he had shot Mr. Buckley after a confrontation, and officers allowed him to leave. He was arrested five days later and charged with second-degree murder and illegal use of a weapon.
On Thursday, Mr. Boyd was released from the East Baton Rouge Parish Prison on $300,000 bond, according to the parish Sheriff’s Office.
“We do believe that Mr. Buckley’s status as someone that is an indigent played as much a part of how the police initially handled the investigation of the shooting as did race,” Ron Haley, a lawyer for Mr. Buckley’s family, said in an interview on Thursday night.
The family’s lawyers said that the discretion that the police had showed toward Mr. Boyd allowed him to remove a series of social media posts that could have implicated him as a “Confederate sympathizer,” including some in which he posed with Confederate flags and clothing.
“We know the Confederates believe in white supremacy and we know that white supremacists believe that Black folks are inferior,” said Ryan Thompson, another lawyer for the Buckley family.
Before Mr. Boyd enters a plea, the case will go to a grand jury, which will decide whether to formally indict him on the second-degree murder charge, which is customary in Louisiana.
Five days after Mr. Boyd&#39;s release on bond, his lawyer, J. Arthur Smith III, asserted in an email statement that his client would be vindicated.
“As the facts are presented in court, it will become clear that this is a case of justified self-defense of Jace Boyd,” Mr. Smith wrote. “A jury must feel free to come to the right decision. And the refrain that ‘no one deserves to die’ does not justify the abandonment of our cherished rule of law where all citizens are presumed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law, not in the media. We will enthusiastically and vigorously defend Jace Boyd in court and will not try this case in the press.”
Mr. Buckley panhandled from time to time, but was not homeless, according to the lawyers for his family, who said he suffered from arthritic knees and was not threatening. They are asking the U.S. Justice Department to investigate Mr. Buckley’s killing, as well as how the police have handled the case.
Police officials declined to discuss the case on Thursday. The mayor of Baton Rouge, Sharon Weston Broome, who is also the president of East Baton Rouge Parish, did not respond to requests for comment, but in an Aug. 25 statement to media outlets in Louisiana said that she had spoken to the police chief and asked him to conduct a “fair and transparent review” of what happened.
“Every citizen deserves to be treated justly, and I promise to the residents of East Baton Rouge Parish that this investigation will be conducted fairly,” she said.
That same day, the Baton Rouge police announced that they had issued a warrant for Mr. Boyd’s arrest. He was taken into custody two days later.

Human rights groups say many of the detentions are based on scant evidence.
NEW DELHI -- After spending several anxious days in prison, Natasha Narwal, a student activist accused of rioting by the New Delhi police, thought her ordeal was nearing an end. 
 A judge ruled that Ms. Narwal had been exercising her democratic rights when she participated in protests earlier this year against a divisive citizenship law that incited unrest across India.
 But shortly after the judge approved Ms. Narwal's release in late May, the police announced fresh charges: murder, terrorism and organizing protests that instigated deadly religious violence in India's capital. Ms. Narwal, 32, who has said that she is innocent, was returned to her cell.
 ''I felt like crying,'' said her roommate, Vikramaditya Sahai. ''We are grieving the country we grew up in.''
 As India struggles to quell surging coronavirus infections, lawyers accuse the authorities of rounding up government critics and keeping them in detention in the middle of a pandemic. It is part of a strategy, they say, to stifle activists who are protesting what they see as iron-fisted and anti-minority policies under Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
 In recent weeks, Ms. Narwal and nearly a dozen other prominent activists -- along with potentially dozens of other demonstrators, though police records are unclear -- have been detained. They are being held under stringent sedition and antiterrorism laws that have been used to criminalize everything from leading rallies to posting political messages on social media.
 India's coronavirus restrictions, some of which are still in effect, have blocked pathways to justice, lawyers and rights activists say. With courts closed for weeks, lawyers have struggled to file bail applications, and meeting privately with prisoners has been nearly impossible.
 Law enforcement officials in New Delhi, who are under the direct control of India's home ministry, have denied any impropriety. But rights groups say the arrests have been arbitrary, based on scant evidence and in line with a broader deterioration of free speech in India.
 In a lengthy report released this month, the Delhi Minorities Commission, a government body, accused the police and politicians from Mr. Modi's party of inciting brutal attacks on protesters and supporting a ''pogrom'' against minority Muslims.
 Meenakshi Ganguly, the South Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said cases against the activists appeared to be ''politically motivated,'' and that the police had devised a formula for keeping people like Ms. Narwal in jail: When a judge orders the release of a prisoner for lack of evidence, new charges are introduced.
 ''The urgency to arrest rights activists and an obvious reluctance to act against violent actions of the government's supporters show a complete breakdown in the rule of law,'' she said.
 Before the pandemic hit, Mr. Modi was in the throes of the most significant challenge to his power since becoming prime minister in 2014. After Parliament passed a law last year that made it easier for non-Muslim migrants to become Indian citizens, millions protested across the country.
 To critics, the citizenship law was more evidence that Mr. Modi's Hindu nationalist government planned to strip the country's Muslims of their rights.
 Tensions peaked in February when sectarian violence and rioting broke out in New Delhi. The vast majority of people killed, hurt or displaced were Muslim, and the police were involved in many of those cases.
 After Mr. Modi announced a nationwide lockdown in late March to contain the coronavirus, shutting down businesses and ordering all 1.3 billion Indians inside, the protests disbanded. Lawyers said the police then moved to detain demonstrators while skirting complaints against government allies.
 Among those in custody are a youth activist who raised awareness about police brutality against Muslims; an academic who gave a speech opposing the citizenship law; and Ms. Narwal, a graduate student who co-founded Pinjra Tod, or Break the Cage, a women's collective that organized some of the largest rallies.
 Nitika Khaitan, a criminal lawyer, said the crackdown had also pushed beyond higher-profile critics to include ordinary residents of riot-hit neighborhoods. She recently challenged those arrests in a jointly signed letter to the Delhi High Court.
 Lawyers have tracked a few dozen such arrests under the lockdown, though Ms. Khaitan said the true figure could not be verified because police reports had not been made public. Many detentions were ''not in compliance with constitutional mandates,'' she said.
 In a recent interview, Sachidanand Shrivastava, the police chief in New Delhi, said his officers were conducting fair investigations.
 In May, the authorities said they had detained about 1,300 people for involvement in the protests and riots, including an equal number of Hindus and Muslims. Recently, the police arrested a group of Hindus for forcing nine Muslim men to chant ''Hail Lord Ram,'' a reference to a Hindu god, before killing them and throwing their bodies into a drain.
 ''It is very important that the police force remain impartial,'' Mr. Shrivastava said. ''And we are following this principle from Day 1.''
 But members of India's judiciary have questioned the official numbers, accusing the police of withholding information about the arrests under national security protections and singling out Muslims for many of the harsher charges.
 In court proceeding notes reviewed by The Times, a judge hearing a case against a Muslim protester wrote that the police appeared to be targeting only ''one end'' without probing the ''rival faction.'' During the riots, the police were accused of abetting Hindus and, in some cases, torturing Muslims.
 Khalid Saifi, a member of United Against Hate, a group that works with victims of hate crimes, was arrested after he tried to mediate between the police and protesters, according to his lawyers.
 The police charged him with being a ''key conspirator'' of the riots. His wife, Nargis Saifi, said he was tortured in custody.
 ''His only crime is he is a Muslim,'' she said.
 M.S. Randhawa, a police spokesman, denied that Mr. Saifi had been tortured, adding that he has regular opportunities to speak to a judge if abuse occurs.
 ''These are just allegations,'' Mr. Randhawa said. ''He would have told the magistrate if he had been tortured.''
 But rights advocates accuse Mr. Modi's government of shielding party officials -- and more broadly, of Hindus involved in the violence.
 Ms. Narwal, who was detained in May, could face at least several years in prison for helping organize demonstrations that blocked a busy road in northeast Delhi, where February's bloodiest battles between Hindus and Muslims broke out.
 The police have accused her of playing a leading role in the riots, charging her with murder, attempt to murder and being part of a ''criminal conspiracy.''
 At the same time, the police have been accused of ignoring complaints against Kapil Mishra, a local politician with Mr. Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party who gave a fiery speech threatening to remove Ms. Narwal and other protesters forcibly if the authorities did not take action.
 Hours after the ultimatum, the streets erupted. But charges were never filed against Mr. Mishra, who has denied a role in starting the riots.
 A New Delhi police superintendent, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that some officers had wanted to act against Mr. Mishra, but that they were pressured by the force's leadership not to touch ''the warriors of the government.''
 ''We did not even try,'' the superintendent said. ''The directions were clear: Don't lay your hands on him.''
 Through an intermediary, Mr. Mishra declined to comment.
 Ms. Narwal's father, Mahavir Narwal, said the government was moving India closer to authoritarianism and demonizing anybody who questioned its policies.
 For weeks, prison officials ignored his calls and emails to Tihar Jail, where Ms. Narwal is being held. With coronavirus restrictions in place, she was moved into an isolation ward at one point, where she stayed for 17 days, said Mr. Narwal, a retired scientist.
 Lately, communication has smoothed out. But Mr. Narwal said the subtext of his daughter's arrest seemed clear: ''If you protest, you will be called a terrorist.''
 ''All she did was fight to keep the soul of India alive,'' he said.

We know, for example, that the Baltimore police department used face id on protestors after the death of Freddie Gray in 2015. And we know that a handful of departments have put out public calls for footage of this year’s protests. It’s been documented that police in Minneapolis have access to a range of tech, including ClearviewAI’s services.

These sites can’t ignore QAnon, but neither can they simply ban it – not really. Platforms tend to prefer to focus on behavior rather than content, so they have ready-made recourse in their terms of service when they want to act against manipulation of algorithms or tactics such as “swarming”… When platforms do focus on content, they are far more likely to act when there is a risk of real-world harm. QAnon has caused real-world harm, surely. But not every post related to the theory runs that risk, and swinging the moderator’s mallet could needlessly squelch speech – perhaps fueling the same accusations of a scheming liberal conglomerate that are the movement’s raison d’etre. And even if platforms did decide QAnon as a whole was too much of a menace to countenance, they’d run into trouble determining which posts qualified.</p><p>QAnon is poised to act as a test case for the convoluted rules and enforcement apparatuses social media sites have developed over their years-long shift toward taking responsibility.

It also involves freedom to seek and receive information, as well as freedom to form opinions. If the ability of platform users to freely form political opinions is distorted by rampant political disinformation, a key dimension of their free expression is undermined…</p><p>#4 Platform powers to promote, demote, label and curate content also are a manifestation of their own expression…</p><p>#5 Platforms should not selectively retreat into the mistaken presumption that they are bound by the First Amendment when governing speech of elected officials.

And, to make that clear, the Town Board says that “refut[ing this] belief” “in any way, shape, or form,” including “through words” (the first item in that list) “IS A HATE CRIME.” That’s targeting not just a viewpoint expressed through “vandalism” or criminal “destruction,” but also through “words.”</p><p> </p><p>The post Daily Media Links 8/17 appeared first on Institute For Free Speech.</p> "

Human rights groups say many of the detentions are based on scant evidence.
NEW DELHI — After spending several anxious days in prison, Natasha Narwal, a student activist accused of rioting by the New Delhi police, thought her ordeal was nearing an end.
A judge ruled that Ms. Narwal had been exercising her democratic rights when she participated in protests earlier this year against a divisive citizenship law that incited unrest across India.
But shortly after the judge approved Ms. Narwal’s release in late May, the police announced fresh charges: murder, terrorism and organizing protests that instigated deadly religious violence in India’s capital. Ms. Narwal, 32, who has said that she is innocent, was returned to her cell.
“I felt like crying,” said her roommate, Vikramaditya Sahai. “We are grieving the country we grew up in.”
As India struggles to quell surging coronavirus infections, lawyers accuse the authorities of rounding up government critics and keeping them in detention in the middle of a pandemic. It is part of a strategy, they say, to stifle activists who are protesting what they see as iron-fisted and anti-minority policies under Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
In recent weeks, Ms. Narwal and nearly a dozen other prominent activists — along with potentially dozens of other demonstrators, though police records are unclear — have been detained. They are being held under stringent sedition and antiterrorism laws that have been used to criminalize everything from leading rallies to posting political messages on social media.
India’s coronavirus restrictions, some of which are still in effect, have blocked pathways to justice, lawyers and rights activists say. With courts closed for weeks, lawyers have struggled to file bail applications, and meeting privately with prisoners has been nearly impossible.
Law enforcement officials in New Delhi, who are under the direct control of India’s home ministry, have denied any impropriety. But rights groups say the arrests have been arbitrary, based on scant evidence and in line with a broader deterioration of free speech in India.
In a lengthy report released this month, the Delhi Minorities Commission, a government body, accused the police and politicians from Mr. Modi’s party of inciting brutal attacks on protesters and supporting a “pogrom” against minority Muslims.
Meenakshi Ganguly, the South Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said cases against the activists appeared to be “politically motivated,” and that the police had devised a formula for keeping people like Ms. Narwal in jail: When a judge orders the release of a prisoner for lack of evidence, new charges are introduced.
“The urgency to arrest rights activists and an obvious reluctance to act against violent actions of the government’s supporters show a complete breakdown in the rule of law,” she said.
Before the pandemic hit, Mr. Modi was in the throes of the most significant challenge to his power since becoming prime minister in 2014. After Parliament passed a law last year that made it easier for non-Muslim migrants to become Indian citizens, millions protested across the country.
To critics, the citizenship law was more evidence that Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalist government planned to strip the country’s Muslims of their rights.
Tensions peaked in February when sectarian violence and rioting broke out in New Delhi. The vast majority of people killed, hurt or displaced were Muslim, and the police were involved in many of those cases.
After Mr. Modi announced a nationwide lockdown in late March to contain the coronavirus, shutting down businesses and ordering all 1.3 billion Indians inside, the protests disbanded. Lawyers said the police then moved to detain demonstrators while skirting complaints against government allies.
Among those in custody are a youth activist who raised awareness about police brutality against Muslims; an academic who gave a speech opposing the citizenship law; and Ms. Narwal, a graduate student who co-founded Pinjra Tod, or Break the Cage, a women’s collective that organized some of the largest rallies.
Nitika Khaitan, a criminal lawyer, said the crackdown had also pushed beyond higher-profile critics to include ordinary residents of riot-hit neighborhoods. She recently challenged those arrests in a jointly signed letter to the Delhi High Court.
Lawyers have tracked a few dozen such arrests under the lockdown, though Ms. Khaitan said the true figure could not be verified because police reports had not been made public. Many detentions were “not in compliance with constitutional mandates,” she said.
In a recent interview, Sachidanand Shrivastava, the police chief in New Delhi, said his officers were conducting fair investigations.
In May, the authorities said they had detained about 1,300 people for involvement in the protests and riots, including an equal number of Hindus and Muslims. Recently, the police arrested a group of Hindus for forcing nine Muslim men to chant “Hail Lord Ram,” a reference to a Hindu god, before killing them and throwing their bodies into a drain.
“It is very important that the police force remain impartial,” Mr. Shrivastava said. “And we are following this principle from Day 1.”
But members of India’s judiciary have questioned the official numbers, accusing the police of withholding information about the arrests under national security protections and singling out Muslims for many of the harsher charges.
In court proceeding notes reviewed by The Times, a judge hearing a case against a Muslim protester wrote that the police appeared to be targeting only “one end” without probing the “rival faction.” During the riots, the police were accused of abetting Hindus and, in some cases, torturing Muslims.
Khalid Saifi, a member of United Against Hate, a group that works with victims of hate crimes, was arrested after he tried to mediate between the police and protesters, according to his lawyers.
The police charged him with being a “key conspirator” of the riots. His wife, Nargis Saifi, said he was tortured in custody.
“His only crime is he is a Muslim,” she said.
M.S. Randhawa, a police spokesman, denied that Mr. Saifi had been tortured, adding that he has regular opportunities to speak to a judge if abuse occurs.
“These are just allegations,” Mr. Randhawa said. “He would have told the magistrate if he had been tortured.”
But rights advocates accuse Mr. Modi’s government of shielding party officials — and more broadly, of Hindus involved in the violence.
Ms. Narwal, who was detained in May, could face at least several years in prison for helping organize demonstrations that blocked a busy road in northeast Delhi, where February’s bloodiest battles between Hindus and Muslims broke out.
The police have accused her of playing a leading role in the riots, charging her with murder, attempt to murder and being part of a “criminal conspiracy.”
At the same time, the police have been accused of ignoring complaints against Kapil Mishra, a local politician with Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party who gave a fiery speech threatening to remove Ms. Narwal and other protesters forcibly if the authorities did not take action.
Hours after the ultimatum, the streets erupted. But charges were never filed against Mr. Mishra, who has denied a role in starting the riots.
A New Delhi police superintendent, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that some officers had wanted to act against Mr. Mishra, but that they were pressured by the force’s leadership not to touch “the warriors of the government.”
“We did not even try,” the superintendent said. “The directions were clear: Don’t lay your hands on him.”
Through an intermediary, Mr. Mishra declined to comment.
Ms. Narwal’s father, Mahavir Narwal, said the government was moving India closer to authoritarianism and demonizing anybody who questioned its policies.
For weeks, prison officials ignored his calls and emails to Tihar Jail, where Ms. Narwal is being held. With coronavirus restrictions in place, she was moved into an isolation ward at one point, where she stayed for 17 days, said Mr. Narwal, a retired scientist.
Lately, communication has smoothed out. But Mr. Narwal said the subtext of his daughter’s arrest seemed clear: “If you protest, you will be called a terrorist.”
“All she did was fight to keep the soul of India alive,” he said.

The panel offered insight into how members currently working within the legal system are striving for change. The webinar was hosted by Jonathan Terry as he led the group with questions and topics relevant to today's political climate. 
Katie Doran, advisor to the Manhattan District Attorney for LGBTQ+ issues, has been working with victims for LGBTQ+ directed crimes since 1998. Doran stresses that the hardest part of working for police reform is that people, and especially LGBTQ+ folks, already do not trust the police. 'I work closely with New York City's LGBT Anti Violence Alliance, [and] a lot of times people go to them instead of the police because they are scared,' Doran said, adding that she want to create a safer environment for LGBTQ+ folks at the DA's office. Doran admits that 'we are asking people in a very vulnerable point in their lives to come to us.' She added that when citizens become victims of crimes, they go to the police with whatever biases and preconceptions they have, whether it's from the media or experience. This relationship of fear is especially harmful for LGBTQ+ victims of homophobic and transphobic violence, she said, noting that 'It's important for [people in law enforcement] to be forward and engage with their community.' 'We must work to understand vulnerable moments and do educational work, not only during a crisis' she comments, referring to the decades of work that she has been a part of, working with programs in New York City where the DA office provides curriculums about domestic violence and hate crimes to schools in the community. 'All the little things send a big message [] we need to think about what [our community] needs from us, and we need to be mindful' Doran says about the relationship between the DA office and the community; she's been working within the system for 20 years, explaining that she's seen a lot of change, but at the same time, 'there's never enough change'. 'It would be morally wrong to say we [at the DA's office] haven't contributed to the violence against LGBT and Black trans womenLaw enforcement has flawed relationship with their community, remembering her early years when 'it wasn't unheard of that an off duty officer was defendant in anti-gay case.: 'We are evolved, but we are not evolving fast enough. It always begins with collaborating with and putting yourself forward, not telling the community to come and tell us, we must be educating ourselves,' she said. Terry asked the panel, 'How do we increase and think about the position that law enforcement is in to help black and brown LGBT communities?' Arcelia Hurtado began her career as the Deputy Public Defender for the city and county of San Francisco in 1998, and today is the managing attorney for Training, Culture, Diversity and Inclusions at the San Francisco District Attorney's office. Hurtado spoke of the broad approach her office has taken towards police reform and accountability policies. 'One thing my office is working on is opening channels of communication with our constituents,' she said, noting that her office has an LGBT advisory board with members of the community meeting quarterly to discuss current and pressing matters. 'We have to start with what we have control over; we have a lot of power and should hold ourselves accountable just as we hold police accountable' she concedes, adding, 'We are all starting to awaken at the potential for the change we want to see'. Terry ends the discussion with a question regarding how we as a society, must rethink the way we see history. Vanity Reid-Deterville is a trans woman of color from Charleston, South Carolina who has worked in her community as a playwright and as an activist. 'Since the founding of America, police was created to patrol slaves and slave revolts,' explaining that the racist thought process embedded in policing is within the early formation of police agencies around the world. 'Police behavior today has only developed from a settler colonialism mindset to further enact violence against LGBT and trans women. That's the culture that police foster and in turn enact with violence against trans women' she said. Reid-Deterville states that 'in the city of Charleston, we discovered that the police department has a budget of over 53 million dollars, but the budget for housing and development was less than one million dollars,' noting there is a history of Charleston police forcefully dispersing homeless people, for the sake of economic development and expansion with the tourism business leaving many homeless and insecure. 'Many trans and gender non-conforming folks are in that group of homeless, because we live in the bible belt state and they are often kicked out of their home' Reid-Deterville adds. Reid-Deterville is also a practitioner of restorative and healing justice, focusing on alternative forms of incarceration. She said the crippling aspect of pre-trial intervention programs lies in the mandatory drug screening and counseling classes, which only add pressure to someone who is already insecure because of the burden of paying retributions to the state. Reid-Deterville, only 26 years old, is hopeful that she will get to see more educated Black trans women in her lifetime with degrees and louder voices.

Four years ago, when Donald Trump first ran for president, he urged Black people to support him, asking us, “What have you got to lose?”
Four years later, we know exactly what we had to lose. Our lives, as we died in disproportionate numbers from the pandemic he has let flourish among us. Our wealth, as we have suffered disproportionately from the worst economic drop America has seen in 90 years. Our safety, as this president has stood behind those police who kill us in the streets and by the armies of white supremacy who march by night and scheme in the light of day.
We have learned other things from this president, too. We have learned the names that we say now, over and over again, at each protest, so that no one will forget them. The names Breonna Taylor and George Floyd and Atatiana Jefferson and Stephon Clark and so many more. Such killings did not start with Mr. Trump, of course. But he wants us to forget them.
If we do, he has offered us a “Platinum Plan” for “Black Economic Empowerment.” The name is appropriate because Mr. Trump is a man who thinks always in terms of financial transactions and deals. A “Platinum Plan,” as if he is offering to upgrade our credit card status. The plan, which at two pagesis derisively brief, offers us a hodgepodge of things that he thinks we would like. He will prosecute the Ku Klux Klan — and antifa activists — as terrorists. He will make Juneteenth a national holiday and lynching a national hate crime. He will create “peaceful” urban, Black neighborhoods, replete with school choice, increased homeownership and the “highest standards” of policing. He will begin “a national clemency project” designed to “right wrongful prosecutions” and “pardon individuals who have reformed.”
In his ignorance or his indifference, or perhaps in his contempt, Mr. Trump does not seem to understand the difference between promises made and promises kept. Another Republican president, Ulysses S. Grant, first suppressed the Klan 150 years ago (and notable by its absence is any Trump promise to suppress the right-wing “militias” of Michigan, the Proud Boys or any of the others). The United States — finally, belatedly — made lynching a federal crime in the civil rights era, almost 60 years ago. Peaceful neighborhoods with affordable homes, good schools, a police force interested in protecting its citizens instead of treating them as an occupied people; safety from domestic terrorists and mob violence, economic opportunity, the celebration of our heritage, and impartial and merciful treatment under the law — these are the rights that most white people in America have long taken for granted, not some sort of concession to be offered as if we were indeed another nation.
Too often, the victories we have won have proved to be ephemeral or incomplete, and our full acceptance as Americans has once again been denied. We have learned to trust only those who will stand with us against the worst storms, who have proved themselves to be our friends not out of electoral expediency but through our shared belief in the best principles of this country and our common humanity.
The polls suggest, we are told, that Mr. Trump has made some small inroads in our vote, that a higher percentage of young Black men will vote for him in 2020 than did in 2016. I have difficulty crediting this. But if it is so, I would urge my brothers to listen better. Not just to the false promises Mr. Trump makes to us, but also at what he says when he is “alone in the room” with his white supporters, promising them at his rallies that if he is re-elected, people of color will not invade their “beautiful suburbs” from our “disgusting cities.”
Mr. Trump is too late. We are everywhere in America. We are in the bone and the blood and the root of the country. We are not going anywhere, certainly not to some fantasy of a new “separate but equal” segregation, we in “our” cities, white people in “their” suburbs.
Perhaps the president is confused by how the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., in his greatest speech, referred to the words of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution as a “promissory note to which every American is to fall heir.” Perhaps that gave Mr. Trump the idea that this was all about money. Surely, money — the household stake, the money with which to buy a home, secure a good education, start a family — was a vital goal of the movement then, just as the need for Black people to be made whole, after all the years of slavery and Jim Crow, is still a pressing need today.
But I was there with Dr. King that day, over a half-century ago, in the shadow of Lincoln’s statue, and what he spoke of was “the riches of freedom and the security of justice.” He quoted the most fundamental promise of the Declaration, that all of us have “certain unalienable Rights” — among them “Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.”
It seems strange that we must still agitate for these basic rights, or that Mr. Trump thinks he is being magnanimous when he offers them to us again as last-minute campaign promises — so long as we stay in our place. In the past, we have turned the wheel in great bursts of energy and faith, and in between, when we stood exhausted and bloodied, there was some sliding back. That is always how it is in a democracy and a people’s movement, but now is the time to move forward again.
Four years ago, faced with the prospect of a Trump presidency, I wrote that what old men know is how quickly things can change. Well, I am still old but I am also still here, at 93, and for all the bitter lessons we have learned from Mr. Trump’s term in office, I can tell you that the wheel is turning again. That we have never had so many white allies, willing to stand together for freedom, for honor, for a justice that will free us all in the end, even those who are now most fearful and seething with denial.
We have learned exactly how much we had to lose — a lesson that has been inflicted upon Black people again and again in our history — and we will not be bought off by the empty promises of the flimflam man.

AMY WALTER, NATIONAL EDITOR, ""COOK POLITICAL REPORT"": So the challenge for this president today is the same challenge that the president has always had, which is, can you win reelection when you don't expand your base, when it is really still about getting that core group of people encouraged, engaged to turn out.
And hope that by going after your Democratic opponent, making that person seem unable to do the job, you can depress enough of the opposition to win a narrow reelection. It's what he's been banking on all along.
And what we've seen is when the focus is on the challenges in front of him, when it's directly on his role as a decision maker and an executive, his own numbers start to drop.
He wants to put that onus back on Joe Biden. And that's hard to do when you go from crisis to crisis.
JOHN KING, CNN ANCHOR: It's incredibly hard to do, especially when you look at the crises before us at the moment. Again, the Trump team hoping these economic numbers continue. If they do, then we will have a different political dynamic in the country.
If you look right now, one of the biggest issues in the country, the coronavirus and race relations in the wake of the George Floyd killing.
Dana, on those issues, Joe Biden outpolls the president and usually by a pretty significant margin.
If those are the issues before the country come election day -- and you can take the names out of it if you don't like what you have, right? If you don't like you're in the middle of a pandemic, you don't like the social unrest, you want to change things. And Donald Trump is the incumbent president.
DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST: Right, it's historically what we've all based on who will win or who won't win on, which is right track, wrong track. Are you happy with who you are? It goes back to Ronald Reagan: Are you better off now than you were four years ago? That's the question for the incumbent president.
You're right. If you think about it, up until the coronavirus, all the crises that kept this president out of the ceiling, about 80 percent, as Amy said, were of his own making. It was because the churning and chaos in the White House, his tweets and staff turnover and a million other things.
These are real crises and they are coming to a head all together. So it is a question of whether or not people are just ready for change, which is a big leap.
Incumbents tend to do well because that's just the kind of nature of the electoral system, right? We all know, we've all watched incumbents looking like things are really bad and the American people are going to kick them out and then they don't end up doing that.
It is a very open question. And we don't know what it's going to look like in five months when people are on the ballot.
But I can tell you, in this meeting he had at the White House yesterday with his campaign team, it was a regular meeting, but they delivered some honest news about the polling, much of which you just showed.
They were telling him this can be turned around if the economy goes up, which is why we heard a very rambling speech, saw a rambling speech at the White House today talking up the economy like his political life depended on it.
KING: We live in a very different world than the last time the American people kicked out a president. That was 1992. We have had three successive two-term presidents, which is an anomaly in our history if you go back.
Amy, what strikes me, I remember the 1992 campaign. I remember going to Los Angeles with then-Governor Bill Clinton after the Rodney King riots. So you had racial unrest before the country.
And you also had a very mild recession but a recession, nonetheless. And I always remember writing things like people's legs were tired. People got tired because they felt like they were treading water in this recession. And even though the economy started to improve in 1992 as it got closer to the election, President Bush could not convince people it was improving.
The dynamics are quite similar but the times are so different. That's why I'm afraid to apply the lessons of 1992 where we are now. But in that situation, the American people, despite the best efforts of President Bush and his campaign, they just wanted something different.
WALTER: Yes, and I think the point you made, John, about being tired is still relevant today. And that's what Joe Biden is counting on.
Look, Donald Trump won as a disrupter. He made a big bet that Americans wanted a disruptor in office and that paid off in 2016.
But it doesn't seem like that's where Americans want to be now. In this time of incredible chaos, do they really want disruption, or do they want to get back to a safer, calmer place.
That's the message Joe Biden has to put forward. That's the message he's trying to address by, every time he gets in front of the camera, usually from his basement in Wilmington, is to make the case he's going to come and steady the ship and steady the plays. We'll see how well he does that.
The other thing, John, is that -- and for Dana, too -- look, all of his advisers, every Republican knows exactly what this president needs to do. The economy comes back to make that the centerpiece of his campaign.
[11:34:59]
But we all know he doesn't like doing that. He didn't do that in 2018 when economists running for reelection were desperate for him to turn the attention on the economy. Instead, he wanted to talk about immigration and the caravan headed to the Mexican border.
So keeping his focused on that is add challenging as trying to bring the economy back to a good place before reelection.
(CROSSTALK)
KING: We had another example of that 20 minutes ago when the president walked into the Rose Gardena and talked about great economic news today and he was all over the place.
He has another problem. He has another problem with the four stars. Jim Mattis was his defense secretary, now questions the president's character and his leadership.
Listen here, John Kelly, another retired general who was the president's chief of staff, they ended on a sour note, just moments ago, talking to -- this is a bizarre thing -- but talking to Anthony Scaramucci, who, for about 10 minutes, was the White House communications director, another person pushed out of the Trump administration.
But listen to General Kelly here, the president's former chief of staff, urging the American people to be careful in November.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GEN. JOHN KELLY, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: He's quite a man, General Jim Mattis. And for him to do that tells you where he is relative to the concern he has for our country.
ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, FORMER WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: Do you agree with him, John?
KELLY: I agree with him. I think we need to step back from the politics. I think we need to look harder at who we elect. I think we should start, all of us, regardless of what our views are in politics, I think we should look at people that are running for office and put them through the filter. What is their character like? What are their ethics?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KING: What is their character like, what are their ethics? Wow.
BASH: Wow is right. Listen, this is a big deal. It really is. We know that the president has run through chiefs of staff. We know that, you know, he's had several of them. We know that John Kelly, as you said, did not leave on the best of terms.
But he is still a good soldier, and he is still somebody who, you know, respects authority. And he is careful.
And the fact that he said this and wanted to do it, ironically, with Scaramucci, who obviously has done a complete 180 on the president, who he supported wholeheartedly and now he wants to throw out, is very, very telling. It's incredibly telling.
The word he chose -- I pick on this, too -- character. This is a man who knows the president from the inside of the building out, who was his top aide, chief of staff. And the fact that he is questioning Donald Trump's character and using that in the same sentence as, be careful who you elect in November, is really remarkable.
KING: And the question, Amy, is who listens to whom, if you will. The president's advisers, to your earlier point, will say, Mr. President, don't respond. Don't respond to Lisa Murkowski. Don't respond to John Kelly. It's a one-hour or one-day story. Focus on what you want to talk about.
But we know this president can't do that. The question is: What about around the country? What about the president's base? He counts on the support of people who respect -- I'm sorry, I need to go to the governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo.
Ladies, thank you.
GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): Melissa DeRosa, secretary to the governor. To her left, Robert Mujica, budget director.
It was another long and ugly night in the United States of America last night. As it was in New York State.
Day 97 of the coronavirus crisis, day 12 of the civil unrest dealing with the aftermath of Mr. Floyd's murder. And this, my friends, is a dangerous combination, colliding crises compounding each other.
But our job is to address what is presented. And this is the reality that is presented, and this is what we will deal with.
On the coronavirus situation, there's a lot to learn from what we just went through, and I believe it's a transformative situation in society and something we can learn from going forward.
Coronavirus was a medical issue. It was a public issue. It was an economic issue. But more than anything it was a social issue. It was about how people behave, right? To address coronavirus, what we really had to do was change society.
It was not a government operation. It was not something I could do governmentally. People had to do it. Government could provide leadership, and we had an operational component, but it was about people making the changes that had to be made.
They had to accept it. They had to understand it. They had to change their behavior. That is a monumental undertaking. Always.
[11:40:05]
Social change? When does social change happen? Social change happens when people are presented with the facts, they understand the facts, they believe the facts, there's a plan forward based on the facts, and people care enough to make a difference.
With coronavirus, I sat up here every day and I said, here are the facts. Here are the number of deaths. Here are the hospitalizations. This is what we're looking for. Here is a plan that I think can take us forward.
Based on those facts, people were motivated because it was about life and death and their life and death and about their family's life and death, and we went forward.
Compare the coronavirus situation to the situation we're in with the social unrest we see. People have seen Mr. Floyd's murder. They're watching what's going on, on the streets, every day. And they're saying enough is enough. And it's what they are seeing and what they know that is disturbing.
And we're going to show you again, for those of you who haven't seen, a scene from Buffalo and a scene from New York City, because this is a story all across the state.

CUOMO: This is Buffalo, New York yesterday. I just spoke with Mr. Gugino (ph) on the phone, who is that gentleman, who, thankfully, is alive. But you see that video, and it disturbs your basic sense of decency and humanity. Why? Why? Why was that necessary? Where was the threat? An older gentleman, where was the threat? Then you just walk by the person when you see blood coming from his head. And police officers walked by.
It's just fundamentally offensive and frightening. It's just frightening. You say: Who are we? How did we get to this place? Incidents of pushing the press. You have incidents of police getting hit with bricks in the head. You say: Where are we? Who are we? And these are undeniable situations.
Buffalo's situation, I want to applaud Mayor Byron Brown. The mayor of Buffalo suspended the police officers yesterday immediately. And I believe the district attorney is looking into it from a possible criminal liability point of view. And I applaud the district attorney for moving quickly. But people see this. They see the facts.
Now, when you have all this emotion, you have to focus on the facts and the intelligence of the matter, right? It can't be about emotion. Of course, police must protect the public safety and police must protect themselves. That's a fact. Of course, there are also cases of police abuse and the abuse of power. That's a fact. You can have two coincident facts.
Mr. Floyd's murder was the breaking point of a long list of deaths that were unnecessary and which were abusive. That is a fact. And people are saying enough is enough. That is a fact. What people are saying is we must change and we must stop the abuse. And that is a fact.
And New York should be at the forefront of that. That's always been New York' legacy as the progressive capital. We are the ones who hold the standard of what is the right progressive reform. And New York should pass next week what we call the Say Their Name Reform Agenda.
[11:45:01]
Say Their Name Reform Agenda comes from the long list of names of people we have seen who have been abused by police officers, by the criminal justice system. And Mr. Floyd is just the last name on a very long list. Fine. Enough is enough. Change the law, take the moment, reform.
There are four cornerstones for our Say Their Name Agenda. One, the disciplinary records of a police officer. If they're being charged and investigated for abuse, their prior disciplinary record is relevant. And, by the way, it's relevant one way or the other.
If there were no other disciplinary proceedings, that can exonerate the person who was charged. If there are prior disciplinary proceedings for this type of behavior, then, yes, it is evidentiary. But people should know.
Chokeholds. We went through this with Eric Garner. Again, you saw it with Mr. Floyd's death. But we learned it first with Eric Garner and many, many other cases, by the way.
Why? We've seen 9/11 calls, which are fake based. A false 911 call based on race should be classified as a hate crime in the state of New York. We know that it's wrong for the local district attorney to investigate the police force from that county.
By executive order, I did the attorney general as an independent prosecutor. That should be codified in law. I did it five years ago. But these are the cornerstones of a real reform agenda that can address what is going on, on the street.
Reform works for everyone's interest here. Stopping police abuse vindicates the overwhelming majority, 99.9 percent, of police who are there to do the right thing and do the right thing every day.
It restores the confidence, the respect and the trust that you need to make this relationship work. You have to heal the police community relationship. That has to happen for the sake of the police and for the sake of the community.
You look at this looting that's been going on in New York City, this hurts poor communities and distressed communities. You saw many businesses destroyed that are relied upon by that community. You can't have the relationship that works one way or the other.
And even in this politically partisan, racially charged environment, there's still truth and there's still facts, and that's what we have to focus on.
That was the truth with the coronavirus. Even though it was all political and everything was partisan and Democrat/Republican and red and blue, it was never they offer us false choices.
COVID, coronavirus, well, do you want to save people's lives or reopen the economy? And you should reopen the economy and forget public health. Or you should take care of people's health but not reopen the economy. It was never either/or. It can't be either/or.
I know from a hyperbolic, rhetorical partisan, it's one or the other. Liberate New York. Worry about health. Close New York. It was never one or the other. That was unintelligent. It was always both.
It's the same situation here. It's not a question of public safety or civil rights. Whose side are you on, public safety or civil rights? It can't be either/or. It can't be police safety or prosecutor safety. Pick a side. Which are you on? Red or blue? Democrat or Republican? Who are you with? You have to be with both.
Yes, you need public safety. And, yes, you need civil rights. Yes, you need police to be safe. And, yes, you need the protestors to be safe. These are false choices. We need both. Even in this hysterical moment, you need to be able to hold two truths in your hands at the same time.
[11:50:04]
How do we change society to make these reforms happen? How do you have a new societal awareness? Can you do that? Can you change behavior to respect one another?
You're darned right you can. We know we can because we know we can because we did it through this coronavirus. In a very fundamental way, you changed people's behavior. Whether or not they leave the house, whether or not they go to school, whether or not they go to work. They changed themselves, remarkably fast and remarkably effective.
We have the lowest number of deaths from coronavirus that we have had since this started, 42 deaths. The lowest number since we started. Eight weeks ago, we had 800. Eight weeks, 800 people died to 42 people died. Amazing.
How did you do that? I did nothing. The people of the state radically changed how they behave. Look at that progress. Lowest number of hospitalizations to date in a matter of weeks. We know we can change and we know we can change dramatically.
People are focused, we have a plan and that's when social reform happens when people are motivated and focused. That was the Civil Rights Act nationally. That was the Triangle Shirtwaist factory fire, which changed labor rights in this nation. That was the environmental movement after the storm came. That was the revolution of the LGBTQ rights after Stonewall.
That's what we just saw in coronavirus, which will go down in history as one of the great transformational moments of society.
And this is a moment to lead in terms of social change. We'll do it because we are New York tough, smart, united and disciplined and loving. And that is what the moment requires.
Thank you.
Questions?
(CROSSTALK)
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Governor, yesterday, we saw medics and lawyers peaceful observers, delivery drivers, all be arrested and be assaulted by police officers. At this point in time, do we think the curfew serves its initial purpose of protecting the public and should be lifted at this point?
KING: Listening to Andrew Cuomo, his daily briefings. These began as daily coronavirus briefings but the governor is using his opportunity to - he knows he has a national platform.
He called it day 97 of the COVID crisis and day 12 of the social unrest crisis in the United States. That, of course, after the brutal killing of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police.
The governor of New York making the case that the country needs to come together. That police need to stop abusing. He specifically condemned an action we saw in Buffalo, New York, a city in his state.
The governor clearly understanding he has a national profile because of the corona coverage, presenting himself as a national voice on the issue of police reform, saying he wants New York State to lead.
I want to bring in CNN's Alexandra Field into the conversation.
It is interesting, Alexandra, he's so often, during coronavirus, contrasts what he was doing and what he wanted to do with national action, specifically President Trump in my cases.
Here, the president of the United States has said bringing the economy back is the best help for the African-American community. He has talked about a tougher approach from police, law enforcement and the military.
Governor Cuomo says, I want the legislation to quickly pass police reforms that essentially tell police, step back, try to deescalate, not escalate.
ALEXANDRA FIELD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Right, laying out a four-point plan he says needs to stop and address what's happening on the streets and address the abuse of police powers. Talking of the need for people to come together to push for and force this kind of social change that he's really talking about. Society needs to demand it and looking at his legislative plan to do it.
This comes after you have these jarring images out of New York State from just last night in Buffalo, this 75-year-old man who's knocked to the ground by police. The governor addressed this head on. He talked about it on Twitter saying it was unjustified and utterly disgraceful. And he talked about it today again in this press conference.
He said he actually spoke to the man who was knocked over. John, that's good news, because at least this man is able to speak to him. We were not certain of his condition, only knew that he was stable.
John, this man was pushed to the ground and bleeding from his ears. Governor Cuomo expressing outrage saying this protester was clearly not a threat to the police.
The governor also expressing his outrage at the fact that the police did not respond by helping the man out after he was knocked to the ground. So many of them, as you saw in the video, just continued to walk by. It is stunning.
[11:55:12]
KING: It is stunning. The governor applauding the mayor for suspending those officers, suggesting there could be a criminal investigation.
Alexandra Field, thank you.
When we come back at the top of the hour, the president is touting new jobs numbers. The president about to hit the road. The president is getting some stiff criticism from his former chief of staff."

(Tasos Katopodis / Getty Images) In 1981, Ben Bagdikian, a veteran journalist and former dean of the University of California, Berkeley, journalism school, tried to explain why The Wall Street Journal published an opinion section dominated by an almost lunatic fringe. 'Executives and stockholders really do want to know the unpleasant truth about corporate life when it affects their careers or incomes. 
At the same time, however, most of them are true believers in the rhetoric of free enterprise,' he noted. Therefore, by 'singing the grand old hymns of unfettered laissez-faire on the editorial pages' while reporting the truth in its news pages, 'the Journal has it both ways.' This was only moderately problematic when US politics was played on a field with center-left and center-right goalposts, though media critics often amused themselves by suggesting that any number of inaccuracies published on the opinion pages could have been easily avoided if their authors took the trouble to read their own newspaper. Unfortunately, the Journal's editorial page helped mess up the game when Republican politicians started taking its arguments seriously. It began with the paper's campaign for supply-side economics under President Ronald Reagan and ballooned with literally thousands of pages of conspiracy theories printed during Bill Clinton's presidency. Incrementally, thanks to the massive investments of billionaires like Rupert Murdoch (now the Journal's owner), Richard Mellon Scaife, the Koch brothers, and the Mercer family, this sort of nuttiness became holy writ within the conservative punditocracy. Under the stewardship of Paul Gigot, who took over the Journal's op-ed section in 2001, the page has lurched rightward with the rest of the conservative movement—to the point that even fabulists like Bret Stephens and Bari Weiss no longer felt comfortable and decamped to pollute the pages of The New York Times. Unlike the Times, however, the Journal's page, with just one centrist exception, often publishes only right-wingers. Opinions may split between those who cheerlead for and those who chide the president. But there is a discernible consistency: a commitment to owning the libs. Today the threat posed by the Trump administration spreading coronavirus misinformation and violently repressing Black Lives Matter protests has made publishing the president's most enthusiastic supporters especially dangerous. As the Times' Senator Tom Cotton brouhaha demonstrated, journalists have pushed the issue of printing fascistic arguments on one's op-ed page front and center. Despite the legacy of live and let live across the news and opinion partition, the Journal's actual journalists took action in July. About 280 signed a long letter to the paper's publisher, Almar Latour, complaining that the opinion section's 'lack of fact-checking and transparency, and its apparent disregard for evidence, undermine our readers' trust and our ability to gain credibility with sources.' The letter had many examples, but a centerpiece was a column titled 'There Isn't a Coronavirus 'Second Wave'' by Vice President Mike Pence, whose arguments were inconsistent with the government's own figures when published and were thoroughly debunked by the Journal's news pages days later. Latour issued an anodyne statement in response, saying, '[We] remain deeply committed to fact-based and clearly labeled reporting and opinion writing. We cherish the unique contributions of our Pulitzer Prize-winning Opinion section to the Journal and to societal debate in the U.S. and beyond.' The editorial board, sounding a lot like Weiss upon her departure from the Times, complained that it would not kowtow to what it called the 'wave of progressive cancel culture' and argued that unlike those fraidy-cats at The New York Times (or so it implied), 'our opinion pages offer an alternative to the uniform progressive views that dominate nearly all of today's media.' Herein lies the dilemma that faces all serious mainstream media organizations: Take the Trump administration at its word, and you are not only disgracing yourself professionally by misinforming people; you are also putting your readers' lives at risk. But if you don't do so, you are vulnerable to the incessant and aggressive working of the refs by right-wing figures who label any attempts to impose standards of truth telling as 'progressive cancel culture.' For a few years after Murdoch's purchase of the paper from the Bancroft family in 2007, the Journal's jewel-like news-gathering operations appeared at risk. The mogul's handpicked editor in chief, the British-born Gerard Baker, complained in 2017 of 'a fit of Trump-induced pearl-clutching among the journalistic elite' and sought to steer the paper's reporting in a pro-Trump direction. That fear was mitigated when Baker was replaced by the veteran journalist Matt Murray in 2018 and relegated first to the news pages and, after his May 15 column 'The Often Distorted Reality of Hate Crime in America,' to the opinion pages. An earlier letter to Latour from staff members argued that the column not only posited 'the highly controversial argument that black people commit more hate crimes than white people' but also used 'only his own single weighted statistical calculation, with no attribution or context' to support it. I do not exaggerate when I say that the result of believing the Journal's editorials can be death. Pence's op-ed, for instance, used false statistics to encourage complacency in places experiencing spikes in coronavirus infections. At least three academic studies have pointed to an increased number of Covid-19 cases where viewership of Fox News, Murdoch's other famous property, is unusually high. A direct causal relationship is difficult to establish, as the same people who are likely to be lied to by right-wing pundits might have refused to take proper precautions anyway. But it is enough to say that misinformation about the virus is a serious public health risk, and we should cheer on the journalists rising up within their institutions to insist that they are no longer willing to be a party to it.

This is all happening right now In America. In this environment Mount Rushmore cannot survive.There is no way Mount Rushmore can survive the insurgency of left-wing domestic terrorism currently unfolding in our country. By John Nolte,[3] June 23, 2020: We have crossed the Rubicon and there is no going back, no putting the toothpaste back in the tube. With the ongoing 1619 Riots, that were sparked with the death of George Floyd, the establishment media and elected Democrats finally did it — finally decided to show their true colors and desperation by openly embracing, championing, and encouraging violence. Before the 1619 Riots, as a country, on the right and left, we all agreed there was one line that could never be crossed; that we could never, ever, ever condone or encourage violence of any kind. You see, we all knew that was the slippery slope to hell. We all knew our civilization and democracy depended on — regardless of the cause and our personal opinion of it — the ideal that we would defend anyone's right to swing their fist right up until it touched the tip of someone else's nose. Gandhi and Rev. Martin Luther King understood this. What I mean is they understood Western Civilization could be made to see the light through peaceful resistance and civil disobedience. They understood that our culture was a culture of conscience, of ideas, of non-violence, and that in the end our hearts would be changed if the only way to defend immoral ideas (colonialism, Jim Crow) was through violence. On the left today, most especially in the media, that culture King and Gandhi knew it could appeal to, is dead. The left are all thugs now, the media are terrorists now, violence is acceptable now, and there's no going back from that. You see, Gandhi and King pursued the moral goals of self-determination and individual liberty, the laudatory goal of freedom. If your agenda is a moral one, non-violent protest will succeed in a civilized country, because in the end, civilized people see the light. The modern left's goals, the modern media's goals, the goals of the terrorists in Antifa and Black Lives Matter are immoral, are the authoritarian goals of tyrants who want to tell us how to think and what to believe, what we can and cannot say They want total control of our children by way of a failed school system, they want total control of that which shapes our culture by way of an entertainment institution that blacklists those who think different, they want total control of political speech by means of tech fascists, and they want total control of our government by way of cheat-by-mail, removing the electoral college, killing the filibuster, and expanding the Supreme Court. The left are now the Woke Taliban, and the Woke Taliban cannot achieve those goals through non-violent protest and civil disobedience because those goals are monstrous. So they are forced, like the Bolsheviks before them, to resort to gangsterism and violence, to terror and lies. And that was always the case with our leftists — not liberals, I'm a liberal in all kinds of ways I'm talking about leftists. But, you see, right up until the 1619 Riots began, no matter how much we disagreed on anything, our media, academic, and political institutions were able to agree on the fundamental and moral idea that in order to remain a civilized country we drew the line at violence. No more. We now live in a world where a very public Black Lives Matter organizer, Shaun King, can openly call[4] for the destruction of Christian churches while Twitter allows the call for mob violence to remain published and the media protect King and Black Lives Matter by ignoring it. We now live in a world where Democrat politicians are doing nothing to stop the violence in their own cities, where the police are obviously being told to stand down as lawless mobs gleefully stream the statues they topple and monuments they desecrate, where a big city mayor sides with the terrorists who occupied six city blocks filled with hundreds of businesses and private residences. We now live in a world where violence against President Trump ans his supporters is openly encouraged[5] by the media. We now live in a world where a New York Times' Pulitzer winner celebrates[6] the idea she is the gasoline fueling the desecration of churches and decimation of black neighborhoods. This is all happening right now In America. In this environment Mount Rushmore cannot survive. All four men carved into the Black Hills of South Dakota hills have been labeled 'problematic' by the left and media, this includes Abraham Lincoln. Already the location of Mount Rushmore is considered 'problematic' because it was once land that belonged to the American Indian. Already the man who sculpted Mount Rushmore is 'problematic' because — although he denied it — he was once a member of the Ku Klux Klan (which means he was once a Democrat). The 1619 Riots are here to stay. The media and the Democrats who run America's major cities see Antifa and Black Lives Matter as their own personal Brownshirts, their way to political power, which means these terrorist groups will be allowed to fester and organize and terrorize And eventually a Democrat president and congress will agree that Mount Rushmore needs to come down, or needs to be returned to the Indians who will then dynamite it, or we will one day see a group of these left-wing terrorists succeed in dynamiting it. There is one way to stop it Only one Come 2020, the American people must repudiate this terrorism at the ballot box, must annihilate the Democrats in such an overwhelming way it will be 50 years before they resort to violence again (remember, it was 50 years ago Democrats used violence to try and preserve the Jim Crow south) But that's the only way, and the polls right now are not encouraging.

233,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_751/Files (250).DOCX","The New York Times",2020-11-03,"1094 words","Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; Pg. 31","By Harry Belafonte",NA,"Trump Is Standing in Our Way",FALSE,"If the president wins again, we have so much more to lose.
Four years ago, when Donald Trump first ran for president, he urged Black people to support him, asking us, ''What have you got to lose?'' 
 Four years later, we know exactly what we had to lose. Our lives, as we died in disproportionate numbers from the pandemic he has let flourish among us. Our wealth, as we have suffered disproportionately from the worst economic drop America has seen in 90 years. Our safety, as this president has stood behind those police who kill us in the streets and by the armies of white supremacy who march by night and scheme in the light of day.
 We have learned other things from this president, too. We have learned the names that we say now, over and over again, at each protest, so that no one will forget them. The names Breonna Taylor and George Floyd and Atatiana Jefferson and Stephon Clark and so many more. Such killings did not start with Mr. Trump, of course. But he wants us to forget them.
 If we do, he has offered us a ''Platinum Plan'' for ''Black Economic Empowerment.'' The name is appropriate because Mr. Trump is a man who thinks always in terms of financial transactions and deals. A ''Platinum Plan,'' as if he is offering to upgrade our credit card status. The plan, which at two pages is derisively brief, offers us a hodgepodge of things that he thinks we would like. He will prosecute the Ku Klux Klan -- and antifa activists -- as terrorists. He will make Juneteenth a national holiday and lynching a national hate crime. He will create ''peaceful'' urban, Black neighborhoods, replete with school choice, increased homeownership and the ''highest standards'' of policing. He will begin ''a national clemency project'' designed to ''right wrongful prosecutions'' and ''pardon individuals who have reformed.''
 In his ignorance or his indifference, or perhaps in his contempt, Mr. Trump does not seem to understand the difference between promises made and promises kept. Another Republican president, Ulysses S. Grant, first suppressed the Klan 150 years ago (and notable by its absence is any Trump promise to suppress the right-wing ''militias'' of Michigan, the Proud Boys or any of the others). The United States -- finally, belatedly -- made lynching a federal crime in the civil rights era, almost 60 years ago. Peaceful neighborhoods with affordable homes, good schools, a police force interested in protecting its citizens instead of treating them as an occupied people; safety from domestic terrorists and mob violence, economic opportunity, the celebration of our heritage, and impartial and merciful treatment under the law -- these are the rights that most white people in America have long taken for granted, not some sort of concession to be offered as if we were indeed another nation.
 Too often, the victories we have won have proved to be ephemeral or incomplete, and our full acceptance as Americans has once again been denied. We have learned to trust only those who will stand with us against the worst storms, who have proved themselves to be our friends not out of electoral expediency but through our shared belief in the best principles of this country and our common humanity.
 The polls suggest, we are told, that Mr. Trump has made some small inroads in our vote, that a higher percentage of young Black men will vote for him in 2020 than did in 2016. I have difficulty crediting this. But if it is so, I would urge my brothers to listen better. Not just to the false promises Mr. Trump makes to us, but also at what he says when he is ''alone in the room'' with his white supporters, promising them at his rallies that if he is re-elected, people of color will not invade their ''beautiful suburbs'' from our ''disgusting cities.''
 Mr. Trump is too late. We are everywhere in America. We are in the bone and the blood and the root of the country. We are not going anywhere, certainly not to some fantasy of a new ''separate but equal'' segregation, we in ''our'' cities, white people in ''their'' suburbs.
 Perhaps the president is confused by how the Rev. Dr. King Martin Luther King Jr., in his greatest speech, referred to the words of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution as a ''promissory note to which every American is to fall heir.'' Perhaps that gave Mr. Trump the idea that this was all about money. Surely, money -- the household stake, the money with which to buy a home, secure a good education, start a family -- was a vital goal of the movement then, just as the need for Black people to be made whole, after all the years of slavery and Jim Crow, is still a pressing need today.
 But I was there with Dr. King that day, over a half-century ago, in the shadow of Lincoln's statue, and what he spoke of was ''the riches of freedom and the security of justice.'' He quoted the most fundamental promise of the Declaration, that all of us have ''certain unalienable Rights'' -- among them ''Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.''
 It seems strange that we must still agitate for these basic rights, or that Mr. Trump thinks he is being magnanimous when he offers them to us again as last-minute campaign promises -- so long as we stay in our place. In the past, we have turned the wheel in great bursts of energy and faith, and in between, when we stood exhausted and bloodied, there was some sliding back. That is always how it is in a democracy and a people's movement, but now is the time to move forward again.
 Four years ago, faced with the prospect of a Trump presidency, I wrote that what old men know is how quickly things can change. Well, I am still old but I am also still here, at 93, and for all the bitter lessons we have learned from Mr. Trump's term in office, I can tell you that the wheel is turning again. That we have never had so many white allies, willing to stand together for freedom, for honor, for a justice that will free us all in the end, even those who are now most fearful and seething with denial.
 We have learned exactly how much we had to lose -- a lesson that has been inflicted upon Black people again and again in our history -- and we will not be bought off by the empty promises of the flimflam man.

""If people search for the Holocaust on Facebook, we'll start directing you to authoritative sources to get accurate information,"" Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg said on Monday.
Zuckerberg, who has long argued that Facebook should not be an arbiter of truth over the content on its platform, said he has ""struggled with the tension"" between protecting free speech and limiting hateful content.
""Drawing the right lines between what is and isn't acceptable speech isn't straightforward, but with the current state of the world, I believe this is the right balance,"" Zuckerberg said.
He said the company is ""expanding"" its hate speech policy, which has previously removed posts praising hate crimes or mass murder, to also ""prohibit any content that denies or distorts the Holocaust.""
Zuckerberg drew criticism when he said in a 2018 interview that Facebook should not remove Holocaust-denying content.
""I'm Jewish, and there's a set of people who deny that the Holocaust happened. I find that deeply offensive,"" he told technology news website Recode at the time.
""But at the end of the day, I don't believe that our platform should take that down because I think there are things that different people get wrong. I don't think that they're intentionally getting it wrong.""
In a blog post announcing the change, Facebook cited a recent survey that found that nearly a quarter of US adults under 40 believed the Holocaust was a myth or had been exaggerated.
""Enforcement of these policies cannot happen overnight,"" the company cautioned.
""There is a range of content that can violate these policies, and it will take some time to train our reviewers and systems on enforcement.""
Facebook has come under fire for allowing fake news and conspiracy theories to flourish on its platform, in particular in the run up to the 2016 US presidential election.
The social media giant has been under pressure to reduce false information and has taken a tougher stance on policing content in recent months.
In its blog post, Facebook said it has taken down 22.5 million pieces of hate speech in the second quarter of 2020 and banned over 250 white supremacist organizations.
Last week, the company said it was removing any group or page that openly identified with QAnon, a conspiracy theory group that holds some far-right views but largely believes that a cabal of paedophiliac Satanists run the world. The move also applies to Instagram.
The social media giant has also announced restrictions on intentional disinformation on the coronavirus as well as posts designed to suppress voting.

 The Senate Commerce Committee has summoned Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Sundar Pichai to testify for a hearing on Wednesday. The executives agreed to appear remotely after being threatened with subpoenas.

 Allegation of 'misinformation'
 With the presidential election looming, Republicans led by President Donald Trump have thrown a barrage of grievances at Big Tech's social media platforms, which they accuse without evidence of deliberately suppressing conservative, religious and anti-abortion views.
 The chorus of protest rose this month after Facebook and Twitter acted to limit dissemination of an unverified political story from the conservative-leaning New York Post about Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, an unprecedented action against a major media outlet. The story, which was not confirmed by other publications, cited unverified emails from Biden's son Hunter that were reportedly disclosed by Trump allies.
 Beyond questioning the CEOs, senators are expected to examine proposals to revise long-held legal protections for online speech, an immunity that critics in both parties say enables the companies to abdicate their responsibility to impartially moderate content.
 Section 230
 The Justice Department has asked Congress to strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the tech companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms. Trump signed an executive order challenging the protections from lawsuits under the 1996 telecommunications law.
 For too long, social media platforms have hidden behind Section 230 protections to censor content that deviates from their beliefs, Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., the Commerce Committee chairman, said recently.
 In their opening statements prepared for the hearing, Dorsey, Zuckerberg and Pichai addressed the proposals for changes to so-called Section 230, a provision of a 1996 law that has served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet. Zuckerberg said Congress should update the law to make sure it's working as intended. We don't think tech companies should be making so many decisions about these important issues alone, he said, approving an active role for government regulators.
 Dorsey and Pichai, however, urged caution in making any changes. Undermining Section 230 will result in far more removal of online speech and impose severe limitations on our collective ability to address harmful content and protect people online, Dorsey said.
 Pichai urged lawmakers to be very thoughtful about any changes to Section 230 and to be very aware of the consequences those changes might have on businesses and consumers. 
 Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd told congressional leaders in a letter Tuesday that recent events have made the changes more urgent. He cited the action by Twitter and Facebook regarding the New York Post story, calling the companies' limitations quite concerning. The head of the Federal Communications Commission, an independent agency, recently announced plans to re-examine the legal protections, potentially putting meat on the bones of Trump's order by opening the way to new rules. The move by FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, a Trump appointee, marked an about-face from the agency's previous position.
 Social media giants are also under heavy scrutiny for their efforts to police misinformation about the election. Twitter and Facebook have slapped a misinformation label on content from the president, who has around 80 million followers. Trump has raised the baseless prospect of mass fraud in the vote-by-mail process.
 Starting Tuesday, Facebook was not accepting any new political advertising. Previously booked political ads will be able to run until the polls close next Tuesday, when all political advertising will temporarily be banned. Google, which owns YouTube, also is halting political ads after the polls close. Twitter banned all political ads last year.
 Democrats have focused their criticism of social media mainly on hate speech, misinformation and other content that can incite violence or keep people from voting. They have criticised Big Tech CEOs for failing to police content, homing in on the platforms' role in hate crimes and the rise of white nationalism in the U.S.
 Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have scrambled to stem the tide of material that incites violence and spreads lies and baseless conspiracy theories.

Read the original story in Chinese at Sing Tao Daily[1] Translated by Rong Xiaoqing Last year, when anti-Semitic incidents were on the rise [2]in New York, New York University freshman Bincheng Mao realized it was not only the Jewish people suffering. So he launched an organization called the East Coast Coalition for Tolerance and Non-Discrimination (ECC) with some college friends, calling for young people to come on board and fight against racism. 
https://citylimits.org/series/voices 'We thought racism against one ethnic group would eventually make all minorities victims,' Mao said.But he never expected he'd soon be a victim of that discrimination himself: On Feb. 7, Mao went to the Bronx to visit friends, stepping into a grocery store on the way. Though the coronavirus had yet to hit the U.S. at the time, Mao wore a mask. While he was waiting in line to pay, a customer walked toward him, called him a 'virus,' and poured half a bottle of mineral water onto his face mask.Growing up in Tianjin, China, Mao had spent four years in high school in the U.S., but says he had never encountered such an overt act of racism. He was stupefied, dropped everything in hands, and ran out of the store. On the subway back home, Mao was nervous. 'Everyone around me looked like they were going to attack me at any moment,' he said.By then, the ECC had already launched an emergency relief project to raise money to donate Personal Protective Equipment to local hospitals. This made Mao even more upset and frustrated about the attack, but also helped him realize that the college students had to do more to fight the wave of anti-Asian sentiment witnessed during the pandemic. 'I wore a mask not only to protect myself, but to protect people around me, including [the attacker],' Mao said. 'Do you think someone who attacks other people for wearing a mask would care if you donate a mask to him?'Following the incident, the ECC launched a new project called 'Minority Defense Initiative: Standing up to Racism and Xenophobia in the Wake of COVID-19,' in which members post videos and write blog posts on their social media platforms to raise awareness about anti-Asian racism and have their voices heard.The project went viral among college students, and some blog entries have received tens of thousands of clicks and been re-posted frequently. Meanwhile, the ECC is working with other cultural and rights organizations to organize anti-racism forums.In May, it helped organize a Zoom forum hosted by the Asia Society, featuring well-known panelists like like Joan Chen, Wang Leehom and Tzi Ma to California Congressman Ted Lieu and CNN presenters Lisa Ling and Van Jones. It attracted more than 1,000 viewers.Mao said the purpose of these events is to help more people be aware of the anti-Asian racism. 'Not everyone knows of it. I believe if they do, most people won't support it,' he said.Will these activities help curb the rising wave of racism? Mao think so. He said 3,000 students from 15 colleges in the U.S. now have joined the ECC, and 'with so many young people getting involved, I am absolutely confident.'

'But Twitter has become its ultimate editor.

She claims she was targeted specifically because she did not share her colleagues' politics.Weiss writes: My own forays into Wrongthink have made me the subject of constant bullying by colleagues who disagree with my views.

The takeover of the Democratic Party by the ideologues of intersectionality and other far-left philosophies is making this proposition increasingly untenable.Recent developments have rendered public representatives of the liberal but pro-Israel approach a nearly endangered political species. This trend, which shows every sign of gathering momentum, will have implications not only for American politics but for the American Jewish community itself.One would have to be in serious denial to think that Bowman will be a friend of Israel in Congress. To the contrary, he will likely align with the 'Squad' on Israel.The recent nationwide unrest and nearly wholesale adoption by Democrats of the radical ideology fueling it have made it apparent to all but the most fervent denialists that postmodern progressivism refuses to accommodate the kind of support for Israel that was once practically taken as a given.Few politicians have exemplified the combination of liberalism and support for Israel the way congressman Eliot Engel (D) has during his more than 30 years on Capitol Hill, most recently representing New York's 16th district.It now appears that his career came to a sudden end with the closing of the polls in his party's recent primary. As of this writing, although mail-in ballots are still being counted, it seems extremely unlikely that Engel will overcome the lead of his far-left challenger, Jamaal Bowman. By the time this article is posted, the final results will probably be known.With Bowman's win, he and the far-left forces backing him will have succeeded in taking out one of the most influential pro-Israel Jewish politicians in the Democratic Party, who currently serves as Chairman of the important House Foreign Affairs Committee.Engel's defeat is problematic enough on its own for those who believe that the synthesis he represents is still viable, but more is at stake since his party's base has been all but captured by the likes of the Black Lives Matter movement.https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ec02wbBWsAAn_TI.jpg 18 Jewish groups urge US to push Jordan to extradite gloating Sbarro terrorist[7] Eighteen major US Jewish organizations in the United States called on the US on Tuesday to exert pressure on Jordan's King Abdullah to extradite Ahlam Tamimi, the Jordanian terrorist who orchestrated the 2001 Sbarro pizzeria bombing in Jerusalem that killed 15 people, including two American nationals.Expressing 'our collective outrage over the Kingdom of Jordan's refusal to extradite the murderer of American citizens,' the organizations urged the US to hold 'Jordan accountable to its commitments under its extradition treaty with the United States and bring all pressure to bear, including but not limited to recent government legislation significantly impacting US financial aid to Jordan.'The US groups' public declaration comes shortly before the August 9 anniversary of the attack, in which a further 130 people were injured. An additional victim, a young mother who is also an American national, has been comatose ever since the bombing.Arnold and Frimet Roth, whose daughter Malki was among those killed in the attack, and who have been battling for the US to bring Tamimi to justice, called the Jewish groups' announcement 'a breakthrough in our efforts to see the mastermind of the August 9, 2001 Sbarro pizzeria massacre, the savage killer of our beloved daughter Malki, brought to justice.' Malki Roth, 15, was a dual Israeli-US citizen. Malki Roth (Courtesy of the Roth family)The Roths noted that other organizations, as well as individuals, have also 'given us generous active help in this long-running effort. We are hugely grateful to them.' Jonathan Tobin: Don't accept the myth of 'Jewish privilege'[8] This notion of ""white Jewish"" privilege is one that has, sadly, been embraced by some Jews who think that unless they atone for their part in the Western crimes of imperialism, colonialism and racism, they will stand accused along with the rest of the white world.This version of Jewish privilege, however, is just as toxic as the one floated by white supremacists.The notion of white Jewish privilege fits in with a mindset that sees the world divided into two groups: evil white people and virtuous people of color victimized by whites. In that formulation, American Jews are participants in the outrage of systematic racism. Israeli Jews fall into the category of oppressors of Third World people, even though the majority of its citizens are actually ""people of color,"" according to the criteria of the ideologues.Both assertions are as false as the more traditional tropes of right-wing Jew-hatred.While America is far from perfect, the idea that it is an irredeemably racist nation and that Jews are part of that problem is simply untrue. America remains an exceptional nation when it comes to anti-Semitism; Jews have been accepted in virtually every sector of society. It's also true that anti-Jewish hate crimes remain the most prevalent form of religious bias in this country, according to two decades of FBI statistics.Subscribe to Israel Hayom's daily newsletter and never miss our top stories!Jews are not the beneficiaries of some mysterious privilege, either in the sense of the conspiracy mongers of the right or the intersectional ideologues of the left.As far as the Jewish privilege of Israel, it remains singled out as the one nation on the planet that is the focus of an international movement focused on its extinction. That it has thrived and grown just makes its enemies all the more frustrated and angry.As the posters on Twitter noted as they seized back the Jewish privilege term from the haters, the story of modern Jewish life has been one in which tragedy looms large. It was necessary to point out that the only privilege Jews have been given throughout history is that of being despised. They've been hated for being poor and for being rich, as well as for being insular and for seeking to assimilate. Anti-Semitism has little if anything to do with Jewish actions.As much as it was appropriate to make that point, it would be equally mistaken to embrace the mantle of eternal victimhood. In 2020, Jews are no longer a weak, powerless people at the mercy of others, ripe for persecution. Hatemongers should be answered with the truth, but not by a mindset in which Jews compete for sympathy. In both the United States and Israel, Jews need not apologize for their freedom or their prosperity. Nor should they accept any attacks on their legitimacy. If holding onto such basic human rights is seen as Jewish privilege by anti-Semites, then so be it.Jemele Hill: The Anti-Semitism We Didn't See[9] Regardless of what happens with Jackson, the unfortunate truth is that some Black Americans have shown a certain cultural blindspot about Jews. Stereotypical and hurtful tropes about Jews are widely accepted in the African American community. As a kid, I heard elders in my family say in passing that Jewish people were consumed with making money, and that they 'owned everything.' My relatives never dwelled on the subject, and nothing about their tone indicated that they thought anything they were saying was anti-Semitic—not that a lack of awareness would be any excuse. This also doesn't mean that my family—or other African Americans—are more or less anti-Semitic than others in America, but experiencing the pain of discrimination and stereotyping didn't prevent them from spreading harmful stereotypes about another group.Jackson is far from the only prominent Black athlete or entertainer to have amplified anti-Semitic tropes in recent years. In 2017, the Anti-Defamation League, which monitors acts of hatred, expressed concerns over a song in which the hip-hop artist Jay-Z rapped, 'Jewish people own all the property in America.' In 2018, the Atlanta rapper 21 Savage's song 'ASMR' created a firestorm because he rapped, 'We been getting that Jewish money. Everything is kosher.' The basketball star LeBron James shared that lyric in an Instagram post, which added to the controversy. Later, James offered only a tepid mea culpa. 'I actually thought it was a compliment,' he said.In the past few days, Jackson's offensive social-media postings haven't received the universal disapproval that they merit. His teammate Malik Jackson and the former NBA player Stephen Jackson defended him. At a time when there is an understandable focus on how Black Americans bear the brunt of systemic oppression and police brutality, some commentators believe that people are afraid to rebuke Jackson, because it may hurt the movement.Black people's fight for their humanity is unrelated to Jackson's error, but they must use their own racial experiences to foster empathy for others. Even in his apology, Jackson showed little recognition of what he'd done. 'I post a lot of things that are sent to me,' the Eagles receiver said in a statement. 'I do not have hatred towards anyone. I really didn't realize what this passage was saying. Hitler has caused terrible pain to Jewish people like the pain African-Americans have suffered. We should be together fighting anti-Semitism and racism. This was a mistake to post this and I truly apologize for posting it and sorry for any hurt I have caused.'The thirst for liberation and equality can never come at the expense of dehumanizing other marginalized groups—especially at a time when hate crimes against Jews have increased significantly. A record number of anti-Semitic incidents was reported last year. (h/t Zvi)When hate is not called out [10] Hate from the extreme right is easy to spot, easy to denounce. Hate from other places is not always acknowledged, much less called out. And this is unfortunate.For instance, when one of the former leaders of the Women's March decided that Zionists cannot be feminists and that Americans who are pro-Israel are not true progressives, she was called out by those of us in the Zionist progressive sphere. Non-Zionist Jews didn't seem to have a problem. Nor did non-Jewish progressive women.When Democratic politicians used antisemitic slurs to talk about Jews especially in relation to Israel, the same held true, only this time instead of just non-Jewish progressive women staying silent, it was the Democratic party.Similarly, when Zionist LGBT folks were excluded from an LGBT gathering in Chicago, progressive Zionists spoke up. Non-Zionist Jews did not. Muslims who are aware that Israel is far more accepting than Muslim countries to LGBT people did not. In fact, non-Jewish LGBT folks didn't call this bias out either.I was upset with all of these instances, but I also recognized that if anti-Israel Jews themselves aren't speaking up, it makes it all too easy for those anywhere on the left to dismiss. But let me be clear, anti-Zionism is antisemitism.Having said that, I understand the resistance to acknowledging hate, let alone calling it out, when those 'on your side' do things that are anathema to you because that can detract from the bigger issue, the larger cause at hand. But that is all the more reason why speaking up is important. It also tells people that some kinds of antisemitism are acceptable, when none ought to be. We lose credibility if we turn a blind eye to that which does not fit our narrative or advance our cause.Seth Frantzman: Has Farrakhanism become mainstream in the US?[11] MORE THAN half of hate crimes in New York City are against Jews, at the very time that Jews are said to be 'white' and thus part of the white majority. This divide - between rhetoric and reality - underpins the antisemitism that appears underpinned by rhetoric that is common in circles that support Farrakhan or groups self-described as 'Black Hebrew Israelites.'The commonality between these apparently disparate strains of antisemitism - blaming 'Rothschilds' for controlling media, assertions that Jews controlled slavery, that Jews are white supremacists and that the real Semites are African - is part of a multilayered anti-Jewish rhetoric that has not only become more mainstream and violent, but is not really being confronted. It is now largely forgotten that a member of the Washington City Council in March 2018 claimed the Rothschilds control the weather.This is a complex anti-Jewish worldview that is built on comments that have been percolating for decades and focuses exclusively on Jews. It's as arbitrary to blame Jews for US slavery as to blame Scottish people. No one claims American Armenians are 'fake' Armenians who are part of 'white supremacy.' When one views this systemic anti-Jewish rhetoric through a prism and asks why other groups aren't similarly singled out, it becomes abundantly clear that this rhetoric is not just uninformed ideas or nave conspiracies, but is part of a worldview.Where does the accusation that Jews played a large part in slavery come from? Who benefits from twisting around the actual reality of slavery and making it a 'Jewish' crime? The conspiracy theories that underpin this US antisemitism have sought to pin American racism on Jews and blame Jews for slavery.The impunity these antisemites enjoy is largely because the US can't seem to weigh various racist prejudices at the same time. This is especially so when some of the most racist anti-Jewish voices ostensibly come from the same groups fighting against racism. From the Women's March to Black Lives Matter, there was an attempt by some to exclude Jews and then single out Jews for criticism.It is difficult to confront this ant-Jewish hatred because it evolved from within a sector of a minority community and is not widely confronted within that community. So long as Farrakhan or other groups that push conspiracy theories are excused or given impunity to push their views, this growing antisemitism likely won't be reduced. That it exists in entertainment, sports and often on the sidelines of major activists' movements shows it is mainstream.Black Lives Matter, the Jews and Palestinian nationalism[12] If there's anything the Jews have learned from their blood-soaked history, it's when someone says they mean to harm you, take them at their word. So to those who suggest that we should excuse the excesses of Black Lives Matter (BLM) for the sake of a greater good, my answer is simple: No.I say no because opposition to one form of racism does not confer immunity to criticism over other forms of ethnic bigotry. Per this fair and uniform standard, the BLM movement stands condemned by the antisemitic words and deeds of its leaders and activists.Black Lives Matter spokespersons proclaim their fervent support for Palestinian nationalism while denouncing the very existence of Israel as the sovereign state of the Jewish people. This means BLM has aligned itself with a political movement that denies the right of Jewish national self-determination and seeks Israel's eradication.Seventy-two years after its establishment in the ancestral homeland of the Jews, Israel now hosts the largest Jewish population in the world. The Jewish state is the focal point of global Judaic culture and civilization.The fates of the Jewish state and Jewish people are inseparably intertwined. Existential animus toward the former, by definition, entails genocidal hostility toward the latter.But the antisemitism that taints Black Lives Matter is not solely confined to the rarefied realm of anti-Zionist political philosophy. Over recent months we have witnessed a wave of gutter Jew-hatred that has culminated in physical violence.Fox TV, Lionsgate Silent About Nick Cannon's Anti-Semitic Tirade[13] Fox Television and the producers of actor Nick Cannon's upcoming daytime talk show are remaining silent about the TV host's recent anti-Semitic tirade, which included comments claiming that Jews control the global banking system.Cannon, host of the Fox TV show The Masked Singer, praised anti-Semitic Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan and claimed people of African descent are ""the true Hebrews,"" a trope meant to undermine the Jewish people's connection to Israel. His comments, made on his YouTube talk show, have sparked a fierce backlash from pro-Israel and anti-hate groups, including the Anti-Defamation League.Cannon also spread classic anti-Semitic conspiracy theories about Jews controlling the global monetary system, saying, ""Going as deep as the Rothschilds, centralized banking, the 13 families, the bloodlines that control everything even outside of America."" This kind of anti-Semitic rhetoric, which has increased in the past few years, is promoted by white nationalist groups and other anti-Semites who continue to blame Jews for global unrest.Fox Corporation, which owns The Masked Singer, did not respond to Washington Free Beacon requests for comment on Cannon's anti-Semitic tirade. Lionsgate's Debmar-Mercury group, which is producing a new daytime television show featuring Cannon, also did not respond to Free Beacon requests for comment. The co-presidents of Debmar-Mercury are Mort Marcus and Ira Bernstein.Cannon had kind words for Farrakhan, one of the most prominent anti-Semites in America, saying during the video that ""every time I've heard him speak, it's positive, it's powerful, it's uplifting for whatever reason, he's been demonized.""Cannon also claimed that Jewish people and ""Zionists""—a term often used as a slur by Israel's detractors—have ""too much power."" .@FOXTV[14] can't pull the plug one week on Farrakhan for his vile hatred of Americans and Jews but stay silent the next when one of their presenters @NickCannon[15] indulges in the very same hatred!@AmericansAA[16] calls on FOX to- Condemn - Apologize - Educate@ADL[17] #StopHateforProfit[18] pic.twitter .com/6ouYG4g22G[19] — Dov Hikind (@HikindDov) July 13, 2020[20] ; This is a BS excuse I keep hearing over and over again after people spout antisemitism.

Guys not knowing about Judaism. Guys not knowing about our culture and our religion.'Schwartz was one of nine current and retired Jewish NFLers who participated in a three-hour online event Sunday night about Jews and professional football in which many players said they had encountered few people within the league who understood their background. A 2016 photo of Geoff Schwartz of the Detroit Lions NFL football team. (AP Photo)The event, streamed live on Aish.tv , was the brainchild of Michael Neuman, an Orthodox Jewish psychologist who gained a measure of fame last year when he competed on, and won, the LeBron James-produced athletic competition series 'Million Dollar Mile' while wearing a kippah.Neuman wanted to continue to inspire Jews to push boundaries — 'When I was a 10-year-old, I would have wanted to see a strong, powerful Jew with a yarmulke on,' he told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency — so he founded a nonprofit organization, the Jewish Inspiration Foundation, aimed at doing just that.Weeks ago, Neuman began planning a live discussion among current and former NFL players who are Jewish in keeping with his mission to highlight 'strong and powerful Jews.' But after the news broke that Jackson had posted anti-Semitic quotes falsely attributed to Adolf Hitler, the event took on both a new urgency and tone. Packers' Preston Smith latest NFL player to share Farrakhan's views against Jews[25] Green Bay Packers linebacker Preston Smith is the latest NFL player to post a message from anti-Semitic preacher Louis Farrakhan on his social media.Smith, 27, on Friday shared a Farrakhan video on his Instagram Stories from another account. In the video, Farrakhan warns his 'brothers and sisters in Africa' against getting a vaccine. Farrakhan accuses Bill and Melinda Gates of wanting to depopulate the Earth, a conspiracy theory that has been propagated on social media and online forums since the coronavirus pandemic took hold in the U.S. in March.It's unclear whether Smith, who attended Mississippi State and is entering his sixth season in the NFL, actually watched the video. He is the latest person to share something related to Farrakhan who, according to the Anti-Defamation League, made false claims that Jews 'owned a lot of plantations' and were involved in the slave trade, among other bogus accusations.As recently as 2018, Farrakhan said in a speech: 'The Jews were responsible for all of this filth and degenerate behavior that Hollywood is putting out: turning men into women, and women into men.'But the ongoing furor over Farrakhan's assertions haven't stopped some NFL players from sharing or defending his remarks.NBA Store Allows 'Defund Police,' 'Beware of Jews' on Custom Jerseys, But Not 'Free Hong Kong'[26] In keeping with league policy on political statements, the official online store of the NBA does not permit fans to order a custom jersey with the phrase ""Free Hong Kong"" printed on the back.""Free Hong Kong"" is one of the many phrases banned under the NBA's new jersey policy, which allows players to display certain political messages such as ""Black Lives Matter,"" but prohibits messages critical of the Chinese regime.Typing ""Free Hong Kong"" into the text box on the NBA store's custom jersey page returns the following message: ""We are unable to customize this item with the text you have entered.

The Party must be forever changed after this episode so this can never happen again.'Those responsible remain in the Party and must be held to account if Sir Keir Starmer is to tear antisemitism 'out by its roots', as he has promised. The EHRC's report is a pivotal moment in this corrective process, which is why we made the original referral to the EHRC and were the sole complainant in its investigation.'Sir Keir told us to judge him not by his words but by his actions, but today marks the first 100 days of his tenure as leader and he has still failed to set out a timeline for fixing Labour's broken disciplinary process or, with one exception in relation to Rebecca Long-Bailey, take action over incidents in the Party.'The EHRC has considered a great deal of evidence from us and we will have more to say when the report is published in due course.'Labour has 28 days in which to make representations to the EHRC in relation to the draft report.On 28th May 2019, the Equality and Human Rights Commission launched a full statutory investigation into antisemitism in the Labour Party following a formal referral and detailed legal representations from Campaign Against Antisemitism, which is the complainant.Sweden transfers funds to an anti-Israeli organization[28] Sweden has recently transferred 1.8 million krona (nearly $200,00) to a Palestinian Swedish organization acting against Israel under the guise of humanitarian aid.As part of a 1.5 billion krona (164 million USD) aid plan, the Swedish government agency SIDA transferred the funds to the Palestine Solidarity Association of Sweden - an organization that openly supports the BDS movement that calls to boycott and impose sanctions on Israel due to the conflict with the Palestinians.The organization is effectively a Palestinian lobby in Sweden and often holds protests against Israel. The organization has previously called to boycott the 2019 Eurovision Song Contest that was held in Israel and also tried to prevent Israeli tennis players from participating in the Davis Cup games held in the Swedish capital.Members of the organization, many of which are Palestinians living in Israel, have also often called for the liberation of Palestine, hosted representatives from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine terrorist faction, and praised Islamic ""martyrs.""The SIDA website states that the organization has applied for aid to ""continue their public relations work, with the aim of providing Palestinians living under occupation or in refugee camps outside Palestine, a voice in Sweden, and to give them additional knowledge about their rights as Palestinians, international law and global goals. The purpose of the project is that the increased knowledge will lead to an increased involvement among the target groups for a just peace and that the image of the Israel-Palestine conflict will be more multifaceted/nuanced, especially in the media.""Despite the Swedish government's generous aid package to the organization, Sweden does not officially support the BDS movement.

But according to the Israeli organizations, they are blacklisted out of political considerations.Founded in 1926 and representing more than 600,000 journalists from 187 trade unions and associations and 146 countries, the IFJ is the world's oldest and largest organization of media professionals.In 2009, the IFJ's executive committee unanimously voted to expel the National Federation of Israeli Journalists on the grounds of 'non-payment of fees.' The executive committee maintained that 'there was no political element in the decision.'But Haim Shibi, director of the Journalists Association in Jerusalem, and formerly a senior official in the National Federation of Israeli Journalists, has a very different account as to what transpired.In an email correspondence with InfoEquitable, a French media watchdog which works closely with CAMERA, Shibi confirmed that by 2009 the Israeli union had refused to pay its dues for a number of years, saying the refusal was 'due to a blatant and ongoing anti-Israel bias, which escalated over the years.' Shibi noted the 'boycott of the Journalists Association in Jerusalem during Middle East visits by the heads of the federation even as they attended meetings in Ramallah. The lack of invitation to the Israeli journalists association to these meetings. The total absence of any interest in coming to a discussion in Jerusalem. Not even the pretense of equal treatment.'CAMERA Letter in NJ Record Palestinian Leaders Reject Statehood[37] Why 'Palestine' is without a stateRegarding ''We need to pursue systematic change': Palestinian Americans in NJ brace for annexation' (northjersey.com, June 28):The reason for the lack of a sovereign Palestinian Arab state — something which, contrary to what the report implies, has never existed — is simple: Palestinian rejectionism. Palestinian leaders have rejected numerous U.S. and Israeli offers for a state, most recently in 2008 after the Annapolis Conference, as explained in reports by Palestinian Media Watch, the Times of Israel, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Tower and Newsweek. The memoirs of several U.S. diplomats involved in the peace process, such as Dennis Ross and Aaron David Miller, confirm that then-PLO leader Yasser Arafat rejected the 2000 proposal at Camp David, as well as the 2001 offer at Taba. The 2008 offer would've given Palestinians a state comprised of 93.7 percent of the West Bank with a capital in eastern Jerusalem, according to a report by Tablet. Palestinian leaders are on record as saying that they consider all of Israel to be 'Palestine,' as evidenced in reports by Palestinian Media Watch.Failure to compromise and negotiate, coupled with a refusal to recognize Israel's right to exist has left Palestinians without a state.Canadian Political Party Leader Calls Jews 'Liars and Deceivers,' 'Tribe of Parasites'[38] A Canadian political party leader has called Jews 'liars and deceivers' and a 'tribe of parasites.'A flier posted on the Facebook page of the Canadian Nationalist Party, led by Travis Patron, is titled 'Beware The Parasitic Tribe.' It includes New Testament phrases and antisemitic tropes, such as calling Jews 'so-called 'inside manipulators'' and stating 'Everywhere these people go, they infiltrate the media, they hijack the central bank, and they infect the body politic like a parasite.'The July 11 flier also accuses Jews of being 'black sheep' who 'hide and they perpetrate and they pull the strings And they laugh about it And they watch us And we fight each other And they profit from our wars And they seek to control and demoralize us in every aspect of what we try to do.'The flier then states, 'It's their world and we're just a number to them. If they had their way, our entire way of life would be eradicated. They don't like us. In [fact], they despise us because of what we are and the spirit we represent. They cannot coexist with it.''And what we need to do, perhaps more than anything, is remove these people, and one-and-for-all, from our country,' continued the flier.Toward the bottom of the sheet, 'The people we speak of are not truly 'Jews.' They are liars and deceivers attempting to shield themselves from criticism using a false identity. Let us be aware and expose them for what they are: a tribe of parasites.'More than 6 million view Nazi death camp song on TikTok[39] A song glorifying the Nazi death camp Auschwitz became a meme on the popular social networking site TikTok, garnering more than 6.5 million views before it was removed, the BBC reported.The song, which features lyrics like 'We're going on a trip to a place called Auschwitz, it's shower time,' first surfaced last week in a video that showed a giant robot scorpion with a swastika attacking and killing people.The video was boosted by TikTok's algorithm, garnering six million views in several days. Several other videos, that also used Holocaust imagery, also used the song, getting another 500,000 views.After being contacted by the BBC, the site took down all the videos, saying that they 'don't tolerate hate speech.''While we will not catch every instance of inappropriate content, we are continuously improving our technologies and policies to ensure TikTok remains a safe place for positive creative expression,' a spokesperson told the BBC.Activists said TikTok, which is very popular with teens, needs to do more. Former Nazi camp guard, 95, charged in Germany[40]A 95-year-old former Nazi concentration camp guard has been charged with war crimes during the Holocaust in what could be one of the last cases of its kind, a German court said Monday.The former guard at the Stutthof Nazi camp near what was then Danzig, now Gdansk in Poland, was charged with complicity in the murder of several hundred people, a spokesman for the district court in Wuppertal told AFP.The ability of the accused to stand trial must now be assessed by experts.Because he was 19 years old when assigned to work as a guard at the Stutthof camp, the case would be handled by a juvenile court.The Nazis set up the Stutthof camp in 1939, initially using it to detain Polish political prisoners.But it ended up holding 110,000 detainees, including many Jews. Some 65,000 people perished in the camp, including around 28,000 Jewish people. German Official Chides Bystanders for 'Lack of Civil Courage' After Munich Rabbi Verbally Accosted by Antisemitic Assailants[41] A German government official has criticized bystanders for a 'lack of civil courage' after a Munich rabbi was verbally accosted last week.Last Thursday evening, Rabbi Shmuel Aharon Brodman was followed after he got off a tram by four men who showered him with personal insults and anti-Israel comments.According to the victim, the assailants spoke English to him and conversed in Arabic among themselves.Ludwig Spaenle — the Bavarian commissioner on combating antisemitism — said, 'I'm particularly concerned about the fact that citizens who obviously saw the incident did not rush the aid of the rabbi or informed the police.''We cannot allow people of Jewish faith to be victims of assault and insults,' he added. 'An attack on Jews is always an attack on society.'A similar antisemitic incident took place in Munich last August.New York Police Searching for Suspects After Orthodox Jewish Man Assaulted on Brooklyn Street[42] New York City police are searching for suspects after an Orthodox Jewish man was assaulted in Brooklyn over the weekend.According to a CBS New York report, the incident occurred on Saturday at 2525 Kings Highway, near East 27th Street.The 51-year-old victim told police he was walking home when three men pulled up next to him in a car and began screaming antisemitic insults.The men then got out of the car and physically attacked him, leaving him with injuries to his face and a broken finger.Police are currently looking for the perpetrators, who were described as being in their late teens or early 20s.The NYPD Hate Crimes Task Force is also involved in the investigation.The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) is offering a reward of up to $10,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the assailants.Austria to create Simon Wiesenthal award for fighting anti-Semitism[43] An Austrian parliamentary committee has paved the way for the creation of an annual prize to encourage the fight against anti-Semitism.An amendment passed last week would create an award named for Simon Wiesenthal, the late Austrian Holocaust survivor and Nazi hunter. The winner would receive about $17,000 annually. Two additional awards of about $8,500 each would go to those who have made a 'special civil society commitment against anti-Semitism and for education about the Holocaust,' according to a parliamentary statement.The amendment is expected to be formally adopted this week.The goal is 'to encourage others to raise their voices,' said Wolfgang Sobotka, president of the National Council, Austria's lower house of parliament.Sobotka, a member of the conservative Austrian People's Party, said he came up with the idea for the prize while on a trip to Israel two years ago.'Simon Wiesenthal was a great Austrian who did not get the recognition he deserved during his lifetime,' Sobotka reportedly said.Oskar Deutsch, head of Austria's Vienna-based Jewish community, said the prize was a tribute to Wiesenthal, who died in 2005 at the age of 95. Deutsch said the prize would support projects that 'strengthen Austria and the whole of Europe, in keeping with humanistic principles.'Wiesenthal's daughter, Paulinka Kreisberg-Wiesenthal, said in a written statement that the prize sends an important signal 'at a time of rising racism, anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial.' Three defense projects win Israel's top security prize[44] Three classified defense projects by the Mossad spy agency, Shin Bet security service, IDF and defense companies have been awarded Israel's top security prize, Defense Minister Benny Gantz has announced.A senior Mossad officer, identified as Aleph, was also presented with a lifetime achievement award for his 'years-long contribution to the security of the state and for his initiative to develop many technological solutions while displaying outstanding talent, creativity, curiosity and courage,' read a statement by Gantz's office.Though the projects that won the prize remain classified, they all involved Israeli defense companies.One project, which led to the IDF gaining 'specialized capabilities [and] a technological breakthrough was achieved, with outstanding vision, creativity and determination,' was led by the Mossad, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, the Israel Air Force and the IDF's Military Intelligence Unit 9900.Another winner was a project led by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), with assistance from the IAF, MAFAT (the Defense Ministry's research-and-development department), Rafael and Elbit Systems.'The project was carried out with utmost courage and determination, and tackled unprecedented technological knowledge gaps allowing for a great leap in IDF capabilities,' the ministry said.Celebrating the Banai Family and the History of Israel in Jerusalem[45] Museums are in crisis all over the world due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With the loss of visitor revenue, many smaller museums are being forced to close, and larger ones are postponing re-openings because restrictions on the numbers of visitors make it economically unfeasible.In Jerusalem, the majority of museums are still closed, although the Tower of David Museum — one of Israel's leading cultural institutions — has just now reopened its doors after being closed for three months during the height of the pandemic.Nestled in the magnificent citadel at the entrance to the Old City, the museum has always appealed to tourists. Currently, it is featuring a new exhibition, running until April 2021, called 'Banai: A Musical Journey From Persia to Jerusalem.'Eilat Lieber, director of the Tower of David Museum, says this exhibit was two years in the planning, and that it focuses for the first time on modern-day Israel — on the well-known Banai family and their influence on the musical makeup of a complicated, rich, and ancient city.Lieber notes that 'the melodies of Jerusalem are holy as well as secular, ancient as well as trend-setting, and in this exhibition, they accompany the journey of the Banai family through more than a century of tradition, history, and development. Their family name means 'builder,' and we see how they built the heart of Israeli culture.'For those unfamiliar with the name Banai, this talented multi-generational family is as synonymous with Israeli culture as the Kennedy dynasty is to American politics.The reopening of the museum was not easy. 'We [opened] our doors, but with only a little over 10% of our staff,' acknowledges Lieber. 'We've had to make some very hard decisions and an immediate switch in our thinking.'18 spectacular shots of Israel from above[46] With Israel still off-limits to most would-be visitors, ISRAEL21c wants to give you a taste of the country's most photogenic spots.

238,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_751/Files (250).DOCX","telegraph.co.uk",2020-07-21,"811 words","BUSINESS; Version:3","By Christopher Williams, Sunday Telegraph Business Editor",NA,"US culture wars escalate as Wall Street Journal staff attack their own opinion pages; About 300 staff on Murdoch-owned newspaper accuse opinion section of publishing misinformation on topics including coronavirus and racism",FALSE,"Hundreds of journalists at the Rupert Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal have mounted an attack on their own newspaper's opinion pages, accusing editors and contributors of undermining readers' trust with misinformation and basic errors on topics including coronavirus and racism.
In what will be viewed as the latest escalation of the so-called culture wars engulfing American institutions, about 300 reporters, editors, video journalists and newsroom technical staff have signed a letter to managers at the Journal's parent company Dow Jones to demand change.
In a copy of the letter seen by The Telegraph, they accuse the Journal's opinion pages of a ""lack of fact-checking and transparency"" and a ""disregard for evidence"".
The letter, due to be sent to Dow Jones chief executive Almar Latour on Tuesday, said: ""Many readers already cannot tell the difference between reporting and opinion. And from those who know of the divide, reporters nonetheless face questions about the Journal's accuracy and fairness because of errors published in opinion.""
The signatories singled out a recent article by US Vice-President Mike Pence, headlined ""There isn't a coronavirus 'second wave'"", which they said was contradicted by prior reporting in the Journal's own news pages. The article included figures that would have been exposed as flawed by ""no more than a Google search"", the letter to Mr Latour said.
A widely read article headlined ""The myth of systemic police racism"" published in early June, a week after George Floyd was killed and as Black Lives Matter protests gathered momentum, ""propelled misinformation"", the letter added.
The Journal's ""employees of colour spoke out about the pain this opinion piece caused them"" after it ""selectively presented facts and drew erroneous conclusions from the underlying data"", Mr Latour was told.
The Harvard researcher behind some of the data the article was based on complained in his own opinion article three weeks later that his work was ""widely misrepresented and misused"" and ""wrongly cited as evidence that there is no racism in policing"".
The complaints also cover articles about tax, the Obamacare healthcare funding scheme and allegations that a white nationalist had written for the opinion pages. A Journal reporter in the Middle East was endangered by a false claim in a tweet by an opinion contributor that she had friends in the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist organisation, the letter further alleged.
 Journal staff have intensified criticism of their own opinion pages as the media grapples with structural changes driven by the internet that blur in readers' eyes the traditionally clear divide between news and opinion in American newspapers. Against a politically polarised backdrop, leading US publications are increasingly faced with toxic internal debates that spill over onto social media.
Last week Bari Weiss, an editor on the opinion pages of the New York Times, publicly resigned claiming she had been ""the subject of constant bullying by colleagues who disagree with my views"". Ms Weiss had been poached from the Journal in 2017 amid concerns in the senior ranks of the New York Times that it had failed to understand and reflect the spectrum of American opinion prior to the election of Donald Trump.
The Journal's opinion section meanwhile has traditionally reflected the views of the US conservative establishment. Tensions between its editors and the larger, more liberal news staff are a fixture of life at the newspaper and existed before its acquisition by Mr Murdoch in 2007, but have been raised since and especially in the current US political climate.
The latest letter of complaint comes weeks after staff complained about a column about race carried in the news pages and headlined ""The often distorted reality of hate crime in America"". The writer Gerard Baker, the Journal's former British editor-in-chief, was subsequently moved to the opinion pages, although the newspaper said the switch had been planned before the controversy.
In their letter to Mr Latour, Journal staff proposed a series of changes they said would make the distinction between news and opinion clearer, including prominent labelling and separate ""most popular"" lists online.
The signatories added: ""We also propose that WSJ journalists should not be reprimanded for writing about errors published in opinion, whether we make those observations in our articles, on social media or elsewhere.""
Almar Latour, chief executive of Wall Street Journal, said it remains ""deeply committed to fact-based and clearly labeled reporting and opinion writing.""
""We cherish the unique contributions of our Pulitzer Prize-winning Opinion section to the Journal and to societal debate in the US and beyond. Our readership today is bigger than ever and our opinion and news teams are crucial to that success,"" he added."

Chairman Nadler Floor Statement in Support of H.Res. 908, Condemning all forms of anti-Asian sentiment as related to COVID-19
Stay informed and connected: Judiciary.House.Gov / @HouseJudiciary

Washington, D.C. - Today, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) delivered the following statement, as prepared, on the House floor in support of H.Res. 908, Condemning all forms of anti-Asian sentiment as related to COVID-19:
""Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 908, a resolution condemning all forms of anti-Asian sentiment as related to COVID-19.
""Among other things, the resolution, introduced by my colleague from New York, Representative Grace Meng, calls upon all public officials to condemn and denounce anti-Asian sentiment, and it calls on Federal law enforcement officials to investigate and document all credible reports of hate crimes against Asian-Americans, to collect data on the rise of hate crimes incidents due to COVID-19, and to hold perpetrators accountable.
""The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing crisis for our country. Over 6.6 million Americans have been infected, and almost 200,000 have died from COVID-19. It has upended the lives of almost every American in some way and it will continue to do so for some time as we brace for a potential second wave of infections.
""On top of bearing the burdens that the pandemic has imposed on all Americans, Asian-Americans have been forced to carry the added anxiety of confronting racial prejudice, including racially-motivated harassment and violence, stemming from a stigma that has unfairly associated them with COVID-19 because of the virus's origins in China, a stigma that has been reinforced by rhetoric suggesting such a link.
""According to the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, since March 19, there have been almost 2,600 cases of anti-Asian discrimination related to COVID-19. According to the resolution, at the pandemic's earliest stage in this country, between February 9 and March 7, there were over 400 such incidents.
""These include the stabbings of an Asian-American father and his two young children, ages 2 and 6, in Texas.
""Public health entities including the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have recognized that labeling a virus by geographic or ethnic terms unfairly stigmatizes certain communities and ultimately harms public health. For this reason, Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar rightly condemned the use of the phrase 'Chinese virus' in testimony before the Ways and Means Committee, stating that 'ethnicity is not what causes the novel coronavirus.'
""It is incumbent on all public figures, including elected officials like us, to publicly condemn bigotry and the stigmatization of racial or ethnic groups unfairly targeted for blame. We must speak out clearly against such attitudes and acts of hate whenever they occur, but particularly in the face of public panic or fear during a national emergency, when society can be especially vulnerable to racist appeals and prejudices.
""While many public figures have admirably sought to end COVID-19-related racial animosity, some, unfortunately, appear not to share the same sense of moral duty. Rather than using their bully pulpits to confront prejudice and racial hatred, they have, instead, chosen repeatedly to use derogatory and prejudicial phrases and remarks reinforcing the exclusion and stigmatization of Asian-Americans in the face of a national crisis--a tactic that, sadly, has a long and ugly history in our country. Left unchecked, this type of rhetoric has, in the past, led to grave injustices like the Chinese Exclusion Act and the internment of Japanese-Americans during the Second World War.
""In the year 2020, condemning bigotry and racial scapegoating should not be hard for any Member of this House to do. It is long past time to leave the days of 'yellow peril' hysteria and unjustified blame of the ""other"" behind. The House can take an important step in that direction by passing H. Res. 908 unanimously. I urge you strongly to support this resolution.
""I reserve the balance of my time."""

From California to Pennsylvania, governors and mayors across the U.S. are ratcheting up COVID-19 restrictions amid the record-shattering resurgence of the virus that is all but certain to get worse because of holiday travel and family gatherings over Thanksgiving.
Leaders are closing businesses or curtailing hours and other operations, and they are ordering or imploring people to stay home and keep their distance from others to help stem a rising tide of infections that threatens to overwhelm the health care system.
“I must again pull back the reins,” New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said Monday as he restricted indoor gatherings to 10 people, down from 25. “It gives me no joy.”
California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced he is pulling the “emergency brake” on efforts to reopen the economy, saying the state is experiencing the fastest growth in cases yet, and if left unchecked, it will lead to “catastrophic outcomes."" The move closes many nonessential indoor businesses and requires the wearing of masks outside homes, with limited exceptions.
The tightening came as Moderna Inc. announced that its experimental coronavirus vaccine appears to be over 94% effective, based on early results. A week ago Pfizer disclosed similar findings with its own formula.

2nd virus vaccine shows striking success in US tests
A second experimental COVID-19 vaccine — this one from Moderna Inc. — yielded extraordinarily strong early results Monday, another badly needed dose of hope as the pandemic enters a terrible new phase.
Moderna said its vaccine appears to be 94.5% effective, according to preliminary data from an ongoing study. A week ago, competitor Pfizer Inc. announced its own vaccine looked 90% effective — news that puts both companies on track to seek permission within weeks for emergency use in the U.S.
The results are “truly striking,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government's top infectious-diseases expert. “The vaccines that we're talking about, and vaccines to come, are really the light at the end of the tunnel.”
A vaccine can’t come fast enough, as virus cases topped 11 million in the U.S. over the weekend — 1 million of them recorded in just the past week — and governors and mayors are ratcheting up restrictions ahead of Thanksgiving. The outbreak has killed more than 1.3 million people worldwide, over 246,000 of them in the U.S.
Stocks rallied on Wall Street and around the world on rising hopes that the global economy could start returning to normal in the coming months. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained more than 470 points, or 1.6%, to close at a record high of over 29,950. Moderna stock was up almost 10%.

AP sources: Trump to order troop cuts in Afghanistan, Iraq
President Donald Trump is expected to cut a significant number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan and a smaller number in Iraq by the final days of his presidency, U.S. officials said Monday. The plan would run counter to military commanders' advice over the past year, while still falling short of Trump's much-touted goal to end America's long wars.
The decision comes just days after Trump installed a new slate of loyalists in top Pentagon positions who share his frustration with the continued troop presence in the war zones. But the expected plans would leave 2,500 troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan, meaning that President-elect Joe Biden would be the fourth president to grapple with the still-smoldering conflicts launched in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
U.S. officials said military leaders were told over the weekend about the planned withdrawals and that an executive order is in the works but has not yet been delivered to commanders. Officials cautioned that there could always be changes, and Trump is known to make snap decisions based on media reports and online chatter. Officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.
There are 4,500 to 5,000 troops in Afghanistan and more than 3,000 in Iraq.
As news broke about the plan, Republican leaders on Capitol Hill issued stark warnings about making any hasty exit from Afghanistan that could jeopardize the peace process and undermine counterterrorism efforts.

'More people may die': Biden urges Trump to aid transition
WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — President-elect Joe Biden on Monday warned of dire consequences if President Donald Trump and his administration continue to refuse to coordinate with his transition team on the coronavirus pandemic and block briefings on national security, policy issues and vaccine plans.
The remarks marked Biden's toughest comments to date on Trump's failure to acknowledge his election loss and cooperate with the incoming administration for a peaceful transfer of power.
“More people may die if we don’t coordinate,” Biden told reporters during a news conference in Wilmington, Delaware.
Biden and his aides — and a small but growing group of Republicans — have emphasized the importance of being briefed on White House efforts to control the pandemic and distribute prospective vaccines. The Trump administration is working on its own distribution plan, while Biden’s chief of staff indicated his transition team will proceed with their own planning separately because of the obstruction.
Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said it's “absolutely crucial that the apparent president-elect and his team have full access to the planning that has gone on” for vaccine distribution.

Pandemic politics leave DC in gridlock as virus surges
WASHINGTON (AP) — With the nation gripped by a resurgent coronavirus and looking to Washington for help, President Donald Trump and lawmakers in Congress have a message for struggling Americans: Just keep waiting.
The urgency of the nationwide surge in virus cases, spiking hospitalizations and increasing death tolls has hardly resonated in the nation’s capital as its leaders are vexed by transition politics and trying to capitalize on the promise of a coming vaccine. The virus has killed more than 247,000 Americans this year and infected at least 11.1 million — some 1 million of them in just the past week.
Yet in Congress, where talks over economic relief bills stalled out months ago, lame-duck approval of aid is hardly front-of-mind. Across town at the White House, Trump is more focused on getting credit for the vaccine development push and blocking President-elect Joe Biden from getting the information needed to ensure the new administration can smoothly take over the fight against the pandemic.
“Another Vaccine just announced,” Trump tweeted Monday morning after Moderna announced that its candidate appeared in early testing to be 95% effective against the virus. “For those great ‘historians’, please remember that these great discoveries, which will end the China Plague, all took place on my watch!”
On a call Monday with governors, Vice President Mike Pence, who heads the White House coronavirus task force, struck a rosy tone and asked states to give their residents comfort that vaccines are coming and that “America and your state has never been more prepared.”

Hate crimes in US reach highest level in more than a decade
WASHINGTON (AP) — Hate crimes in the U.S. rose to the highest level in more than a decade as federal officials also recorded the highest number of hate-motivated killings since the FBI began collecting that data in the early 1990s, according to an FBI report released Monday.
There were 51 hate crime murders in 2019, which includes 22 people who were killed in a shooting that targeted Mexicans at a Walmart in the border city of El Paso, Texas, the report said. The suspect in that August 2019 shooting, which left two dozen other people injured, was charged with both state and federal crimes in what authorities said was an attempt to scare Hispanics into leaving the United States.
There were 7,314 hate crimes last year, up from 7,120 the year before — and approaching the 7,783 of 2008. The FBI’s annual report defines hate crimes as those motivated by bias based on a person’s race, religion or sexual orientation, among other categories.
Some of the 2019 increases may be the result of better reporting by police departments, but law enforcement officials and advocacy groups don’t doubt that hate crimes are on the rise. The Justice Department has for years been specifically prioritizing hate crime prosecutions.
The data also shows there was a nearly 7% increase in religion-based hate crimes, with 953 reports of crimes targeting Jews and Jewish institutions last year, up from 835 the year before. The FBI said the number of hate crimes against African Americans dropped slightly to 1,930, from 1,943.

Hurricane Iota's front edge pushing onto Nicaragua coast
MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) — The front edge of powerful Hurricane Iota began battering Nicaragua's Caribbean coast Monday night, threatening catastrophic damage to the same part of Central America already battered by equally strong Hurricane Eta less than two weeks ago.
Iota had intensified into an extremely dangerous Category 5 storm early in the day, but the U.S. National Hurricane Center said it weakened slightly by Monday night to Category 4, with maximum sustained winds of 155 mph (250 kph). It was centered about 30 miles (45 kilometers) south of the Nicaraguan city of Puerto Cabezas, also known as Bilwi, and moving westward at 9 mph (15 kph).
Iota was hitting the Caribbean coasts of Nicaragua and Honduras with torrential rains and strong winds while the western edge of the storm began battering the Nicaraguan coast.
Authorities warned that Iota would probably come ashore over areas where Eta’s torrential rains saturated the soil, leaving it prone to new landslides and floods, and that the storm surge could reach 15 to 20 feet (4.5 to 6 meters) above normal tides.
In Bilwi, business owner Adán Artola Schultz braced himself in the doorway of his house as strong gusts of wind and rain drover water in torrents down the street. He watched in amazement as wind ripped away the metal roof structure from a substantial two-story home and blew it away like paper.

SpaceX capsule with 4 astronauts closes in on space station
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — SpaceX’s newly launched capsule with four astronauts closed in Monday on the International Space Station, their new home until spring.
The Dragon capsule was due at the orbiting lab late Monday night, following a 27-hour, completely automated flight from NASA's Kennedy Space Center.
This is the second astronaut mission for SpaceX. But it’s the first time Elon Musk’s company is delivering a crew for a full half-year station stay. The two-pilot test flight earlier this year lasted two months.
The three Americans and one Japanese astronaut will remain at the orbiting lab until their replacements arrive on another Dragon in April. And so it will go, with SpaceX — and eventually Boeing — transporting astronauts to and from the station for NASA.
This regular taxi service got underway with Sunday night's launch.

About 90K sex abuse claims filed in Boy Scouts bankruptcy
NEW YORK (AP) — Close to 90,000 sexual abuse claims have been filed against the Boy Scouts of America as the Monday deadline arrived for submitting claims in the organization’s bankruptcy case.
The number far exceeds the initial projections of lawyers across the United States who have been signing up clients since the Boy Scouts filed for bankruptcy protection in February in the face of hundreds of lawsuits alleging decades-old sex abuse by Scout leaders.
“We are devastated by the number of lives impacted by past abuse in Scouting and moved by the bravery of those who have come forward,” the Boy Scouts said in a statement. “We are heartbroken that we cannot undo their pain.”
A few hours before the 5 p.m. EST deadline, the number of claims totaled 88,500, lawyers said.
Eventually, the proceedings in federal bankruptcy court will lead to the creation of a compensation fund to pay out settlements to abuse survivors whose claims are upheld.

The Erie Community Foundation hosts an annual scholarship reception to provide educational funds to local students. This year's reception was cancelled due to COVID-19, but the students will soon receive their awards. More than $725,000 will be dispersed from 118 scholarship funds held at The Erie Community Foundation, totaling 550 awards.
A newly established fund will provide a scholarship in honor of Joseph Michael Kulka Jr., who, at the age of 28, was murdered in a gay hate crime in 1982. The Joseph M. Kulka Jr. Scholarship for diversity leadership was established within the LGBT Community Endowment of The Erie Community Foundation. The scholarship is intended to be awarded annually to a person pursuing a four-year college program and who has given of their personal lives to improve awareness and understanding of diversity in the Erie County community. The recipient need not be a member of any particular segment of society, only having demonstrated leadership in this field with expectation that their efforts will continue in college and adult life.
A native of Sharpsville, PA, Joe Kulka was the first in his extended family to graduate from college. A mental health counseling major, he received his degree from Gannon and was devoted to those with learning disabilities. He worked at Sunland Center in Orlando at the time of his death and always made his clients number one in his life.
Kulka believed in the worth of all people, no matter their race, faith, nationality, sexual orientation, gender identification or intellectual attainment. Bob Ploehn, initial benefactor of the scholarship, said, ""The oldest of nine children, Joe was a leader and mentor. He loved Erie while at Gannon and the Barber National Institute. He would be smiling humbly while proud to be remembered as helping local students become leaders in promoting community diversity.""
For the inaugural year, the Joseph Michael Kulka Scholarship will benefit two students with an $800 scholarship each. Congratulations to Adria Urbanowicz, a Mercyhurst Preparatory School graduate who plans to attend Fredonia State University of New York to earn a BFA in Musical Theater, and Riley Nicholson, a McDowell High School graduate who will attend Penn State University for Mechanical Engineering.
""If we deny someone the opportunity to be true to oneself, we are telling that person we don't see them,"" said Urbanowicz. ""This breaks society into stereotypes and causes division among people."" Nicholson said, ""As a member of Exposure, we tackle global issues such as LGBTQ+ rights. I learned that not everyone looks the same, loves the same or believes the same. Our job is not to judge but to accept.""
When Ploehn, formerly of Erie and now residing in Florida, was asked why he chose to support a scholarship fund at The Erie Community Foundation, he said, ""Erie is on the verge of great change and growth, and I wanted to invest in a community that is thriving and needs support.""

Two white men who the authorities say helped pin a Black man against a tree by an Indiana lake on the Fourth of July were charged on Friday with battery and other crimes.
The charges against the men, Sean M. Purdy and Jerry Edward Cox II, came after Vauhxx Booker, a member of the Monroe County Human Rights Commission in Bloomington, Ind., said on Facebook that a group of men had assaulted him and had threatened to “get a noose.”
Video of the episode drew broad condemnation, and the F.B.I. said it was investigating the confrontation, which Katharine C. Liell, Mr. Booker’s lawyer, said was clearly a racially motivated hate crime. Ms. Liell said that Mr. Purdy had been wearing a hat with a Confederate flag on it, which upset Mr. Booker.
Mr. Booker said he learned on Friday that he had tested positive for Covid-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. Ms. Liell said the men had spat and yelled in Mr. Booker’s face when they confronted him on July 4.
“We need to realize we are all human and that this quest is for justice, rather than vengeance,” Mr. Booker, 36, said on Friday at a news conference held on Zoom with Ms. Liell. “I want us to understand that accountability, which is what I’m asking for, is not the same as punishment.”
Mr. Purdy, 44, was charged with three felonies: criminal confinement, intimidation and battery resulting in moderate bodily injury, according to Erika Oliphant, the prosecuting attorney in Monroe County, Ind.
Ms. Oliphant said that Mr. Cox, 38, was charged with two felonies — aiding, inducing or causing criminal confinement, and battery resulting in moderate bodily injury — as well as three misdemeanor charges of intimidation and battery.
In a statement, one of Mr. Purdy’s lawyers, Mark Kamish, said the legal team was “obviously disappointed” with Ms. Oliphant’s decision to charge Mr. Purdy but not Mr. Booker, whom the statement called Mr. Purdy’s “trespassing assailant.”
The statement said that “legitimate and evidence-based charging recommendations by law enforcement officers” had been ignored.
“Indiana law allows citizens to make arrests of people punching other people on private property, and to use reasonable force in doing so,” the statement said. “Indiana also has a broad self-defense statute.”
Ms. Liell said it was not clear if Mr. Booker had actually hit Mr. Purdy or Mr. Cox during the struggle.
“He was trying to protect himself,” she said. “Whether he actually made contact with anyone, I don’t think even Mr. Booker knows.”
Mr. Cox’s lawyer, Joseph Lozano, said he would not comment on a pending case.
Mr. Booker said the encounter began after he and his friends gathered to watch a lunar eclipse at Lake Monroe, a large beach near Bloomington that is about 60 miles south of Indianapolis.
A group of white men told Mr. Booker and his friends that they were on private property, he said on Facebook.
Part of the confrontation was captured on a cellphone video that Mr. Booker posted online. The video shows one man holding Mr. Booker against a tree as several other people surround him. Bystanders can be heard calling for them to let him go.
“I was attacked by five white men,” Mr. Booker said on Facebook, “who literally threatened to lynch me in front of numerous witnesses.” He said he had heard the men say “get a noose” and use racial slurs.
Mr. Booker said that bystanders eventually got the men to stop and that he and his friends left the area and called the authorities. In another video, the men can be seen following Mr. Booker and his friends, accusing them of trespassing and berating them with profanity.
In his Facebook post, Mr. Booker said he had a minor concussion, some abrasions, bruising and loss of hair from having been pulled.
According to a report filed by an investigator with the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, footage of the confrontation showed that it was Mr. Purdy who held Mr. Booker against the tree.
In an interview for the report, Mr. Purdy acknowledged that he had been wearing a cowboy hat with a Confederate flag on it and drinking “quite a bit” that day. Mr. Purdy said that he had forced his way between his girlfriend, Caroline McCord, and Mr. Booker after Mr. Booker started yelling at Ms. McCord.
“Don’t talk to my lady like that,” Mr. Purdy said he told Mr. Booker, according to the report. “You are over here on our property. You are not going to come over here and do this.”
Mr. Purdy claimed that Mr. Booker had punched him in the jaw, causing a large bruise on his chin. He said his memory was “a little blurry” after that and he didn’t remember how he ended up holding Mr. Booker against a tree, according to the report.
Ms. McCord said she told Mr. Booker and his friends before the confrontation that they were on private property owned by her father, according to the report.
She said Mr. Booker then told her he was a county commissioner and said, “Do you know how many fines I can charge you for?” according to the report.
Ms. McCord said she asked Mr. Booker to leave, but Mr. Booker became aggressive and said: “I’m going to make your life miserable. I could put all these fines on your land and you won’t even know what to do,” according to the report.
In the report, Mr. Cox told an investigator that he had probably consumed a “12 pack” that day and that he “had a good buzz.” He said that Mr. Booker had punched him in the eye and that he had hit Mr. Booker twice. He said that neither he nor anyone else had said “get a noose,” although he acknowledged that he had used a racial slur and that he was “sorry about that,” according to the report.
As videos of the confrontation spread online, they drew outrage from officials and helped motivate a protest in the city on July 6. A driver of a red Toyota accelerated into a crowd of protesters that night, injuring at least two people.
Ms. Liell said that the F.B.I. was investigating the case as a possible hate crime. The F.B.I. said on Friday that it does not comment on ongoing investigations.
In a statement, Mayor John Hamilton of Bloomington and the city clerk, Nicole Bolden, condemned the confrontation, saying that a group “physically assaulted and denounced and threatened with racial epithets one Black resident of Bloomington.”

Neither.",FALSE,"This piece was submitted for ""From Where I Sit,"" an ongoing column associated with the ESOL program that aims to share the stories and experiences of international students. Frank Meng is a student from Beijing, China. In this article, he writes about the stereotypes of Asians and the pandemic's effect.
""Go back to China and stop the Chinese Virus!"" A driver yelled at me outside of Hannaford a couple of weeks ago. The narrative of Asians and Asian Americans has suddenly shifted from ""model minority"" back to ""yellow peril."" Both of the stereotypes are categorically problematic.
The term ""yellow peril"" was created in the late 19th century by a Russian sociologist Jacques Novikow and introduced in popular culture in 1912 through Dr. Fu Manchu, a fictional villain in Sax Rohmer's series of novels. Using the color ""yellow"" to refer to the skin tone of East Asians, it presents the racist notion that Asian Americans are unclean and unfit for citizenship in America. The notion of yellow peril also fueled the initiation of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the first immigration law ever implemented that banned immigration solely based on race.
""Model minority"" suggests that Asian Americans should stop fighting oppression because they have relatively higher socioeconomic status. In Hollywood, this was shown through Charlie Chan in 1945, a fictional Hawaiian detective who embodies the smart and passive Asian stereotype. The character was played by white actors in yellowface, highlighting the belief that Asians should not have a voice for themselves. Characterizing Asian Americans as the ""model minority"" is harmful as it not only ignores the differences within Asian Americans, but also suppresses them from speaking out about the racism and discrimination that they still face, such as the idea of being a perpetual foreigner.
The discourse about yellow peril becomes more relevant than ever under COVID-19. Even after the World Health Organization states that cities, countries, regions, or continents should be avoided in naming diseases, President Trump repeatedly referred to COVID-19 as the ""Chinese virus,"" stigmatizing the Chinese people. Reinforcing the notion of yellow peril, the terminology allows people to justify their animosity against Asians. According to WSJ, in New York City alone, there are more than 104 hate crimes against Asians and Asian Americans reported in the past two months. More and more Asian Americans are facing physical assaults, refusal of service and even vandalism.
We need to reject the both false and harmful stereotypes. Asians and Asian Americans are neither model minority nor yellow peril. We need to collectively fight against a dehumanizing and discriminatory system that puts the rights of some over the rights of others."

Trump to order troop reductions in Afghanistan, Iraq
The Trump administration is expected to cut the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan almost in half to 2,500 by Jan. 15, U.S. officials said Monday. The order would stop short of outgoing President Donald Trump's goal to have all troops withdrawn by the end of the year, which had faced opposition from military and diplomatic advisers.
The Pentagon also expects to cut the number of troops in Iraq to 2,500, a reduction of more than 500. The decisions come as no surprise, following Trump's shakeup of the Pentagon leadership last week in which he installed loyalists who share his frustration with the continued troop presence in the war zones. The cuts give Trump an accomplishment in his final weeks in office even as he refuses to concede his election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.
The officials said military leaders were told over the weekend about the planned withdrawals and an executive order is in the works but has not yet been delivered to commanders. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. There are between 4,500-5,000 troops in Afghanistan now, and more than 3,000 in Iraq.
Under the planned order, the troop cuts would be completed just five days before Biden takes office, leaving him with a smaller military footprint in the two key war zones. Military commanders have expressed less concern about pulling more troops from Iraq, where the Iraqi forces are better able to maintain their nation's security.
Trump's new Pentagon chief, Christopher Miller, hinted at the troop withdrawals over the weekend in a carefully worded message to the force that suggested compromise.

Hurricane Iota now a Category 5 storm near Central America
MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) - Hurricane Iota rapidly strengthened Monday into a Category 5 storm that is likely to bring catastrophic damage to the same part of Central America already battered by a powerful Hurricane Eta less than two weeks ago.
Iota has intensified over the western Caribbean on approach to Nicaragua and Honduras. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said the storm had maximum sustained winds of 160 mph (260 kph). It was centred about 55 miles (90 kilometres) east-southeast of Puerto Cabezas, also known as Bilwi, Nicaragua and moving westward at 9 mph (15 kph).
Authorities warned that Iota would probably come ashore over areas where Eta's torrential rains saturated the soil, leaving it prone to new landslides and floods, and that the storm surge could reach a shocking 15 to 20 feet (4.5 to 6 metres) above normal tides.
That storm surge was on the mind of Yasmina Wriedt on Monday in Bilwi's El Muelle neighbourhood, sitting tight against the sea.
""The situation doesn't look good at all,"" Wriedt said. ""We woke up without electricity, with rain and the surf is getting really high.""

Americans across party lines, regions embrace marijuana
HELENA, Mont. (AP) - Bill Stocker could be considered the archetype of a conservative voter: He's a retired Marine and former police officer who voted for President Donald Trump. But he's also among the majority of South Dakota voters who broadly legalized marijuana this month.
Stocker, 61, said enforcing marijuana laws gets in the way of pursuing other drug crimes and called warnings about the ills of marijuana ""a bunch of baloney"" that even people in a Republican stronghold like South Dakota no longer believe.
South Dakota's values of ""personal responsibility and freedom"" won out, said Stocker, who lives in Sioux Falls.
The 2020 election helped prove how broadly accepted marijuana has become throughout the United States, with measures to legalize recreational pot also breezing to victory in progressive New Jersey, moderate Arizona and conservative Montana. Fifteen states have now broadly legalized it, while 36 states allow medical marijuana.
Voters in Mississippi overwhelmingly approved medical marijuana this month, giving the drug another foothold in the South."

From California to Pennsylvania, governors and mayors across the U.S. are ratcheting up COVID-19 restrictions amid the record-shattering resurgence of the virus that is all but certain to get worse because of holiday travel and family gatherings over Thanksgiving.
Leaders are closing businesses or curtailing hours and other operations, and they are ordering or imploring people to stay home and keep their distance from others to help stem a rising tide of infections that threatens to overwhelm the health care system.
“I must again pull back the reins,” New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said Monday as he restricted indoor gatherings to 10 people, down from 25. “It gives me no joy.”
California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced he is pulling the “emergency brake” on efforts to reopen the economy, saying the state is experiencing the fastest growth in cases yet, and if left unchecked, it will lead to “catastrophic outcomes."" The move closes many nonessential indoor businesses and requires the wearing of masks outside homes, with limited exceptions.
The tightening came as Moderna Inc. announced that its experimental coronavirus vaccine appears to be over 94% effective, based on early results. A week ago Pfizer disclosed similar findings with its own formula.

2nd virus vaccine shows striking success in US tests
A second experimental COVID-19 vaccine — this one from Moderna Inc. — yielded extraordinarily strong early results Monday, another badly needed dose of hope as the pandemic enters a terrible new phase.
Moderna said its vaccine appears to be 94.5% effective, according to preliminary data from an ongoing study. A week ago, competitor Pfizer Inc. announced its own vaccine looked 90% effective — news that puts both companies on track to seek permission within weeks for emergency use in the U.S.
The results are “truly striking,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government's top infectious-diseases expert. “The vaccines that we're talking about, and vaccines to come, are really the light at the end of the tunnel.”
A vaccine can’t come fast enough, as virus cases topped 11 million in the U.S. over the weekend — 1 million of them recorded in just the past week — and governors and mayors are ratcheting up restrictions ahead of Thanksgiving. The outbreak has killed more than 1.3 million people worldwide, over 246,000 of them in the U.S.
Stocks rallied on Wall Street and around the world on rising hopes that the global economy could start returning to normal in the coming months. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained more than 470 points, or 1.6%, to close at a record high of over 29,950. Moderna stock was up almost 10%.

Trump to order troop reductions in Afghanistan, Iraq
The Trump administration is expected to cut the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan almost in half to 2,500 by Jan. 15, U.S. officials said Monday. The order would stop short of outgoing President Donald Trump’s goal to have all troops withdrawn by the end of the year, which had faced opposition from military and diplomatic advisers.
The Pentagon also expects to cut the number of troops in Iraq to 2,500, a reduction of more than 500. The decisions come as no surprise, following Trump’s shakeup of the Pentagon leadership last week in which he installed loyalists who share his frustration with the continued troop presence in the war zones. The cuts give Trump an accomplishment in his final weeks in office even as he refuses to concede his election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.
The officials said military leaders were told over the weekend about the planned withdrawals and an executive order is in the works but has not yet been delivered to commanders. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. There are between 4,500-5,000 troops in Afghanistan now, and more than 3,000 in Iraq.
Under the planned order, the troop cuts would be completed just five days before Biden takes office, leaving him with a smaller military footprint in the two key war zones. Military commanders have expressed less concern about pulling more troops from Iraq, where the Iraqi forces are better able to maintain their nation's security.
Trump's new Pentagon chief, Christopher Miller, hinted at the troop withdrawals over the weekend in a carefully worded message to the force that suggested compromise.

'More people may die': Biden urges Trump to aid transition
WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — President-elect Joe Biden on Monday warned of dire consequences if President Donald Trump and his administration continue to refuse to coordinate with his transition team on the coronavirus pandemic and block briefings on national security, policy issues and vaccine plans.
The remarks marked Biden's toughest comments to date on Trump's failure to acknowledge his election loss and cooperate with the incoming administration for a peaceful transfer of power.
“More people may die if we don’t coordinate,” Biden told reporters during a news conference in Wilmington, Delaware.
Biden and his aides have emphasized the importance of being briefed on White House efforts to control the pandemic and distribute prospective vaccines. The Trump administration is working on its own distribution plan, while Biden’s chief of staff indicated his transition team will proceed with their own planning separately because of the obstruction.
Biden called the vaccine distribution a “huge, huge undertaking,” and said that if his team has to wait until he takes office to dig into the government’s distribution plan, they’ll be “behind, over a month, month and a half.”

Pandemic politics leave DC in gridlock as virus surges
WASHINGTON (AP) — With the nation gripped by a resurgent coronavirus and looking to Washington for help, President Donald Trump and lawmakers in Congress have a message for struggling Americans: Just keep waiting.
The urgency of the nationwide surge in virus cases, spiking hospitalizations and increasing death tolls has hardly resonated in the nation’s capital as its leaders are vexed by transition politics and trying to capitalize on the promise of a coming vaccine. The virus has killed more than 246,000 Americans this year and infected at least 11.1 million — some 1 million of them in just the past week.
Yet in Congress, where talks over economic relief bills stalled out months ago, lame-duck approval of aid is hardly front-of-mind. Across town at the White House, Trump is more focused on getting credit for the vaccine development push and blocking President-elect Joe Biden from getting the information needed to ensure the new administration can smoothly take over the fight against the pandemic.
“Another Vaccine just announced,” Trump tweeted Monday morning after Moderna announced that its candidate appeared in early testing to be 95% effective against the virus. “For those great ‘historians’, please remember that these great discoveries, which will end the China Plague, all took place on my watch!”
On a call Monday with governors, Vice President Mike Pence, who heads the White House coronavirus task force, struck a rosy tone and asked states to give their residents comfort that vaccines are coming and that “America and your state has never been more prepared.”

Hate crimes in US reach highest level in more than a decade
WASHINGTON (AP) — Hate crimes in the U.S. rose to the highest level in more than a decade as federal officials also recorded the highest number of hate-motivated killings since the FBI began collecting that data in the early 1990s, according to an FBI report released Monday.
There were 51 hate crime murders in 2019, which includes 22 people who were killed in a shooting that targeted Mexicans at a Walmart in the border city of El Paso, Texas, the report said. The suspect in that August 2019 shooting, which left two dozen other people injured, was charged with both state and federal crimes in what authorities said was an attempt to scare Hispanics into leaving the United States.
There were 7,314 hate crimes last year, up from 7,120 the year before — and approaching the 7,783 of 2008. The FBI’s annual report defines hate crimes as those motivated by bias based on a person’s race, religion or sexual orientation, among other categories.
Some of the 2019 increases may be the result of better reporting by police departments, but law enforcement officials and advocacy groups don’t doubt that hate crimes are on the rise. The Justice Department has for years been specifically prioritizing hate crime prosecutions.
The data also shows there was a nearly 7% increase in religion-based hate crimes, with 953 reports of crimes targeting Jews and Jewish institutions last year, up from 835 the year before. The FBI said the number of hate crimes against African Americans dropped slightly to 1,930, from 1,943.

Hurricane Iota now a Category 5 storm near Central America
MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) — Hurricane Iota rapidly strengthened Monday into a Category 5 storm that is likely to bring catastrophic damage to the same part of Central America already battered by a powerful Hurricane Eta less than two weeks ago.
Iota has intensified over the western Caribbean on approach to Nicaragua and Honduras. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said the storm had maximum sustained winds of 160 mph (260 kph). It was centered about 55 miles (90 kilometers) east-southeast of Puerto Cabezas, also known as Bilwi, Nicaragua and moving westward at 9 mph (15 kph).
Authorities warned that Iota would probably come ashore over areas where Eta’s torrential rains saturated the soil, leaving it prone to new landslides and floods, and that the storm surge could reach a shocking 15 to 20 feet (4.5 to 6 meters) above normal tides.
That storm surge was on the mind of Yasmina Wriedt on Monday in Bilwi's El Muelle neighborhood, sitting tight against the sea.
“The situation doesn’t look good at all,” Wriedt said. “We woke up without electricity, with rain and the surf is getting really high.”

About 90K sex abuse claims filed in Boy Scouts bankruptcy
NEW YORK (AP) — Close to 90,000 sexual abuse claims have been filed against the Boy Scouts of America as the Monday deadline arrived for submitting claims in the organization’s bankruptcy case.
The number far exceeds the initial projections of lawyers across the United States who have been signing up clients since the Boy Scouts filed for bankruptcy protection in February in the face of hundreds of lawsuits alleging decades-old sex abuse by Scout leaders.
“We are devastated by the number of lives impacted by past abuse in Scouting and moved by the bravery of those who have come forward,” the Boy Scouts said in a statement. “We are heartbroken that we cannot undo their pain.”
A few hours before the 5 p.m. EST deadline, the number of claims totaled 88,500, lawyers said.
Eventually, the proceedings in federal bankruptcy court will lead to the creation of a compensation fund to pay out settlements to abuse survivors whose claims are upheld.

What does COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness mean?
It refers to the likelihood that a coronavirus shot will work in people.
Two vaccine makers have said that preliminary results from their late-stage studies suggest their experimental vaccines are strongly protective. Moderna this week said its vaccine appears nearly 95% effective. This comes on the heels of Pfizer's announcement that its shot appeared similarly effective.
Those numbers raised hopes around the world that vaccines could help put an end to the pandemic sometime next year if they continue to show that they prevent disease and are safe.
Effectiveness numbers will change as the vaccine studies continue since the early calculations were based on fewer than 100 COVID-19 cases in each study. But early results provide strong signals that the vaccine could prevent a majority of disease when large groups of people are vaccinated.

The response to COVID-19, voter suppression, police violence, and LGBTQ rights are driving their work to get their parents, old-enough friends, and other New Yorkers to vote. 'If you go on TikTok or you go on Twitter or you go on Instagram, you see these comments. 'You can't even vote. 
Why do you care?' We have to erase that notion, ' said Leonel Ramirez, 17, of Brooklyn. Ramirez, who is a senior at Food and Finance High School in Manhattan, is active in YVote[1], a nonprofit that gives students opportunities to talk politics and learn how they can make a difference, regardless of their age or immigration status. (YVote's founder, Sanda Balaban, is a member of Chalkbeat's reader advisory board.) In recent months, YVote participants have made scorecards[2] for assessing candidates on issues such as racial and climate justice, created public service announcements, and reached out to voters. 'For people I can get through to, I kind of just walk them through the process: how to register, how easy it is,' said Kenisha Mahajan, a 15-year-old who lives in Queens and is a sophomore at Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan. 'I just try to get them as involved as possible. I tell them: You can become a poll worker or do phone banking.' What follows are excerpts from our interviews with New York City teenagers about their political awakenings and why this election matters to them. These interview excerpts have been lightly edited for length and clarity. Born a day lateKarla Sterrett, 17, Bronx, New York Freshman, City College of New York, Manhattan Karla Sterrett Courtesy photo I'm 17 right now, and Nov. 4, literally the day after Election Day, is my 18th birthday. I went with my mom to vote and was looking over the ballot, and I was just like: Isn't there some way [for me to vote]? Then I read it and was like, yeah, I'm not going to jail! Don't want to do that! During the 2016 election, I was a freshman. Seeing everyone's faces and just viewing everyone's energy — the election felt so vital and important. I didn't really grasp it. I thought: It doesn't really involve me, I'm so young, this doesn't matter. But since I joined YVote in 2017, I've been on this crazy train of wanting to try to educate others about voting rights, Black people's rights. Learning about voter suppression definitely altered my mindset. Throughout history, Black people had to take extremely hard tests just to prove we should be able to vote. There are still so many barriers, especially for Black people, people who are incarcerated, people who are immigrants. It's an ongoing fight to show we are citizens of the U.S. There needs to be more talk around this. On Election Day, I'm going to be spreading resources to people who are voting on Nov. 3 and trying to rush to the polls. We're not going to know [the election results] on Nov. 3 because of all of the absentee and mail-in ballots. Whether it's a Trump rally or Biden supporters, there's going to be friction, so I'm just advising people to be careful. 'It's pretty tough to be a conservative'Isaiah Taylor, 17, Queens, New York Senior, Benjamin Franklin High School for Finance and Information Technology, Queens Isaiah Taylor Courtesy photo This will be my first election season remotely politically involved. Before this, I had a natural interest in politics and already considered myself conservative. Right now [the issues driving me] are voter integrity, voter suppression, COVID response, and domestic policy toward inequality. It's a good first step that both of our presidential candidates are speaking toward racial injustice issues and proposing different policy changes. I have a strong, strong passion for foreign policy. I just wrote a paper for my AP government class about how imperative it is that everybody knows what's going on outside of the United States. I'm pretty sure the general American public doesn't know the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty that was originally instated by President Ronald Reagan was recently suspended. People don't know about the [clashes between] Armenia and Azerbaijan. At school, it's pretty tough to be a conservative. People say, 'Oh my God, you are conservative — do you support this candidate?' I'm like, 'No — just because I'm in a certain party doesn't mean I support a specific candidate.' People will attack you and say you're racist or you're sexist. I say to them: It's really stupid to generalize all of Republicans or conservatives because you were making the argument that certain minorities should not be generalized. So why were you generalizing me and the rest of the people in my party? Even my family members are taken aback that I am a Republican. My mother identifies as independent and my dad is a Democrat. It was really tough to develop that individuality, instead of saying I'm a Democrat because everybody else is. Immigrants: our voices matterKenisha Mahajan, 15, Queens Sophomore, Stuyvesant High School, Manhattan Kenisha Mahajan Courtesy photo I grew up in India and moved here around third grade. Obviously, as young people, we feel really limited because we can't vote yet. Even though my family can't vote, I try to encourage people we know to vote. I know a lot of family members or friends who are just over 18 or in college, and they don't know much about voting. A lot of them weren't really exposed to that, or they come from immigrant families. And one thing I've seen in immigrant families is there's kind of this belief that your voice doesn't really belong and that voting isn't going to make a difference. For people I can get through to, I kind of just walk them through the process: how to register, how easy it is. I just try to get them as involved as possible. I tell them: You can become a poll worker or do phone banking. There are quick and easy ways to get involved. What they're saying on TikTokLeonel Ramirez, 17, Brooklyn Senior, Food and Finance High School, Manhattan Leonel Ramirez Courtesy photo Four years ago, when the Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton election was happening, I actually ran for my school presidency that same week. I had lost the presidency and no one wanted Donald Trump to win, regardless of how young we were. Especially coming from a first-generation family — my mom is Mexican-American and my dad is from El Salvador — it was not a fun time. I remember the next day, in homeroom, no one was happy with the results. Teachers are supposed to be very neutral. They aren't supposed to tell you their politics, but you could see where they stood. It was a very gray ambiance. In the past, if I'm being totally honest, elections have never been a priority for me. I kind of watched it from afar, whether it be through YouTube or through my friends or what my parents were saying, but it didn't seem like something that concerned me. Within the LGBTQ community, you think, I'm still young; I'm part of Generation Z; this has nothing to do with me. If you go on TikTok or you go on Twitter or you go on Instagram, you see these comments. 'You can't even vote. Why do you care?' We have to erase that notion. Looking back on it now, it does affect me. The majority of my friends are queer identified, so I'm taking that into account. Can I walk down the street without being called a slur? Can my friends choose the bathroom they want to use? Are my transgender friends going to have the acknowledgment they deserve? Just because marriage isn't a prospect for us right now, doesn't mean that six years from now we're not going to want to. It's not enough to say. 'I'm an ally' or to stay in the range of 'I have gay friends.' You have to be anti-homophobia. You have to be anti-hate crime. Just like in the Black Lives Matter Movement, you can't remain complicit because the voices in the room are not always reflective of the voices in America. George Floyd inspired me to get involvedKiara Green, 17, Brooklyn Junior, Achievement First Brooklyn High School Kiara Green Courtesy photo I was never interested in politics. During coronavirus, when we were in quarantine, when George Floyd [was killed], my school gave us a day off[3] if you wanted to make a change or voice how you're feeling. I wanted to be engaged in politics. There are always people saying: Oh these youths don't do anything. They're always on the streets. Gangs and everything. I don't want to be in that stereotype category. I wanted to get out of my comfort zone. Right now, I'm in the process of becoming a poll worker, though they're taking so long to email me the link to train. I'm confused whether I'm in it or not, so I'm crossing my fingers. My mom says I'm a workaholic. I have no time to rest. Helping my parents navigate the newsMichelle Del Villar, 18, Bronx Freshman, City College of New York, Manhattan Michelle Del Villar Courtesy photo I came to the U.S. from Spain five years ago, so I'm a first-generation immigrant. I can't personally vote. By being involved and spreading information, I can make my voice count and allow people to understand what's happening. My family members, they barely speak English. Most of them speak Spanish. There are a lot of limitations and obstacles for them. They rely on two main channels on TV that are in Spanish, and they are really biased. When my parents are watching the news, they'll say: I saw this. And I have to explain. On Election Day, I'll be trying to convince my family members who can vote to vote. Also, something really important during this election is mental health. These are really uncertain times due to the pandemic and the election, and [some] people don't have access to mental health services or don't have people to talk about it. Establishing that safe space with someone who seems to be really worried about the election, just to talk about it with them, is really important. 'Are you registered to vote?'Bianca Peterkin, 16, Bronx Junior, Bronx Early College Academy For Teaching and Learning Bianca Peterkin Courtesy photo I saw this video[4] by [the rapper] YelloPain called, 'My Vote Don't Count.' He says, a lot of people say, 'My vote doesn't count,' but they don't really know about the election. I realized, I need to know what I can do. I've been learning more. In our racial justice group, we talk about education, health care, affordable housing, police brutality, COVID-19. We only focus on the presidential elections, but we don't realize the Senate and all these other elections are also important. YVote linked me to the New York Immigration Coalition[5]. They do text banking and phone banking. I joined in the beginning of October. We text and ask people: Are you registered to vote? If they're not registered, you can send them the link. Another member and I also worked on a racial justice scorecard. You can check it off if candidates meet the criteria. We focus on the issues that touch on racial justice: education, health care. Police brutality is another issue, still occurring after all these years. Now, my mom and my sister come to me, asking: Where do I go for my early poll site? They both voted early.

10 federal, state, county and local officials of color who represent Seattle urged the Mayor and Police Chief to immediately end law enforcement's violent response to ongoing demonstrations, completely rethink policing to uphold the safety of all communities and institute serious accountability and transparency measures into police contracts.
U.S. Representative Pramila Jayapal (WA-07) and nine city, county and state elected officials of color who represent the Seattle community sent a letter to Mayor Jenny Durkan and Police Chief Carmen Best today that urged them to enact meaningful and transformative changes to the very nature of policing throughout the city.
""We write as elected officials of color who represent various parts of the City of Seattle and are deeply committed to honoring the lives of the many Black brothers, sisters and siblings who have been killed by police violence and are currently experiencing the triple threats of a global pandemic, pervasive anti-Blackness and police violence,"" wrote Seattle's elected officials of color who serve at the local, county and state level. ""We believe this is the moment to enact meaningful and transformative change in the very nature of policing at the federal, state and local levels.""
The letterled by Congresswoman Jayapal and Seattle City Council President Lorena Gonzalezis also signed by State Senators Joe Nguyen, Rebecca Saldaa and Bob Hasegawa, State Representative Cindy Ryu, King County Councilmember Girmay Zahilay and Seattle City Councilmembers Teresa Mosqueda, Tammy Morales and Kshama Sawant. It calls on Mayor Durkan and Chief Best to take three critical and timely actions:
First, immediately end law enforcement's violent response to ongoing demonstrations by ending the use of the National Guard; stopping the use of all forms of chemical substances for crowd control; ending the use of rubber bullets and flash-bangs; and demilitarizing police on the streets who interact with protestors.
Second, completely rethink policing to create a model for public safety that truly upholds the safety of all communities and redirect law enforcement spending and investing into essential services.
Third, immediately institute serious accountability and transparency measures into police contracts.
The elected officials' full letter is here.
The letter comes just hours after Representative Jayapal helped to introduce the Justice in Policing Act, federal legislation that would implement long overdue police accountability and reform measures by establishing a federal police misconduct registry, making lynching a federal hate crime, ending qualified immunity, requiring reporting of all incidents of use of force to the Justice Department, banning chokeholds and no-knock warrants for drug cases, restricting the transfer of military equipment to local police and increasing accountability, oversight and transparency. The New York Times has described this new legislation as ""the most aggressive intervention into policing by Congress in recent memory.""
